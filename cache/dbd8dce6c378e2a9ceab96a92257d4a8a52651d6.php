<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Melbourne's residential real estate price plunge may have created a unique buying opportunity, some experts say.</p>

<p>Border restrictions and coronavirus lockdowns have stopped people moving to Melbourne via immigration or relocation, reducing demand for Melbourne property.</p>

<p>With unemployment rising, the housing market has been falling and Melbourne auction clearance rates are at zero due to lockdowns.</p>

<p>Pictured: Melbourne on September 11. Buyers have been cautioned about a glut of units but well-located detached houses are considered 'growth potential' by two property experts</p>

<p>According to CoreLogic, Melbourne home prices fell by 1.2 per cent in August, the largest fall recorded in the nation's capital cities, and 4.6 per cent since the pandemic first hit the property market in April. </p>

<p>CoreLogic's head of research, Tim Lawless said Melbourne's price falls were largely due to a demand decrease caused by a halt in migration.</p>

<p>By contrast, regional markets avoided the drop in demand caused by the pause in the influx of migrants, he said, in CoreLogic's Hedonic Index report on September 1.</p>

<p>'Regional markets may also be appealing for their relatively low density and lower price points. The normalisation of remote work through the pandemic could make proximity to major cities less of a factor in home purchasing decisions,' he said. </p>

<p>Another property expert said the plunge in the Melbourne market has opened a window of opportunity for those wishing to buy a home.</p>

<p>Agent Pete Wargent said the combination of low interest rates and price falls meant that buyers could now negotiate hard on well-located residential property. </p>

<p>However after the pandemic ceases the mass migration may resume, once again putting upwards pressure on home prices, putting them once again out of reach.</p>

<p>'For those homebuyers with the stability of employment, a solid deposit, and a reasonable buffer, the best time to buy a house in Melbourne is likely to be as soon as practicable,' Mr Wargent told 7news.</p>

<p>Melbourne's population was forecast to grow larger than Sydney by 2026 before the pandemic hit, according to ABS data.</p>

<p>Greater Sydney's population is expected to grow to 6.6 million by 2036, according to the NSW Department of Planning. </p>

<p>Property expert Doron Peleg, chief executive of RiskWise Property Research said several Melbourne areas showed potential once borders are re-opened.</p>

<p>Houses in the established suburbs of Ashwood, Kew East, Malvern East and Preston looked promising for house price growth, while East Geelong was predicted to be a popular regional buy.</p>

<p>'From a capital growth perspective, we forecast a strong outlook for houses in Melbourne in 2021, but the market for units is much more likely to be flat,' Mr Peleg said.</p>

<p>Monthly dwelling price movements </p>

<p>Sydney: DOWN 0.5 per cent to $860,182 </p>

<p>Melbourne: DOWN 1.2 per cent to $667,520 </p>

<p>Brisbane: DOWN 0.1  per cent $503,128 </p>

<p>Perth: FLAT 0.0 per cent to $443,777 </p>

<p>Adelaide: FLAT 0.0 per cent to $444,021 </p>

<p>Hobart: UP 0.1 per cent to $490,743 </p>

<p>Darwin: UP 1 per cent to $393,386 </p>

<p>Suburban homes in areas where not many new detached homes were being built were likely to be the best bet.</p>

<p>Mr Peleg had earlier warned buyers to stay away from units off-the-plan, especially in Melbourne and Docklands which were the top two riskiest suburbs for oversupply. </p>

<p>Digital Finance Analytics principal and property expert Martin North has also warned about a flood of units hitting the market in his popular DFA YouTube updates on the Walk The World channel.</p>

<p>He sounded a note of caution on Monday about bargain hunting in Melbourne, warning investors not to try to catch a falling knife - especially in a time of rising unemployment and falling rents.</p>

<p>'The uncomfortable truth is that the “pretend and extend” initiatives of the Government and regulators will not save the property market from further falls despite lower interest rates,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Monday.</p>

<p>'There is a clear reduction in the number of genuine buyers out there, thanks to the closure of international borders, less interest from property investors and a diminishing pool of prospective first-time buyers.</p>

<p>'On the other hand, we see a rise in forced sales as the banks start pressing people to recommence repayments, more down-traders and property investors seeking to sell, as equity is drained from their property values - and for investors, a rent famine.' </p>

<p>Mr North said his experience says the economic downturn will last for years with the worst price falls and defaults not showing until much later, as they did in Ireland, Iceland, the UK and US after the global financial crisis in 2008.   </p>

<p>He also said the Federal Government's HomeBuilder grants, which give eligible home owners $25,000 of taxpayer dollars to renovate or build a new home, was purely about helping the construction sector and not housing affordability.   </p>

<p>'Prices rise for land-and-home packages by the amount of the stimulus,' he said. </p>
