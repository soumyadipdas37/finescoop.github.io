<p>Spilling secrets: Former Neighbours star Nicola Charles has revealed sordid details of what went on behind the scenes of the long-running soap. Pictured on Neighbours</p>

<p>'I was patted on the knee in a very condescending way and told you can always leak photos of yourself after you wrap with the show to boost your image,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's from days of old that one, naked photos leaked online. This is the same Neighbours' producer who said to me, "Would you like me to buy you a set of tits?"</p>

<p>'I said no thank you, I plan on breast feeding. He said, "It's fine, I've done it for all the other girls," and I said, "Really, I'm okay, thank you."' </p>

<p>Shocking: In an interview with the Herald Sun on Friday, the 50-year-old actress-turned-author revealed a producer on the show once offered to pay for her to get a boob job</p>

<p>Nicola said this all took place during the late '90s, and described it as being 'different times'.</p>

<p>She recounted having her name called out while sitting in the green room one day, and said she was terrified she was in trouble.</p>

<p>'But it was just the general stuff, offering a set of boobs, telling me to behave, what to wear,' she added.</p>

<p>Naked ambition: Nicola appeared on the series from 1995 to 2016, and confessed the same producer also encouraged her to leak naked photos. Pictured on Neighbours</p>

<p>While she refused to name the producer, explaining he's since died, Nicola said he would use money as an incentive for her to do certain things.</p>

<p>'He would say some pretty out there stuff to me about how I looked, my body, the things I said, the direction my career could take, dangle things like money in front of me and say this is how much you could earn,' she explained.</p>

<p>Nicola said the culture of the show appears to have since changed for the better, and praised the series for including minority and gay storylines.   </p>

<p>'I was patted on the knee in a very condescending way and told you can always leak photos of yourself after you wrap with the show to boost your image,' she said</p>
