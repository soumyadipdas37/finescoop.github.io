<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kier Starmer has drawn level with Boris Johnson in latest opinion poll with nearly 40% of Britons surveyed saying he looks like the next man to be running UK </p>

<p>Labour has crept up three points and the Conservatives have fallen by two since the last poll to create the deadlock, since the last poll.</p>

<p>It is a boost for the opposition leader on the eve of his party's first ever virtual party conference.</p>

<p>The YouGov poll shows that Labour and the Conservatives are head-to-head in the race for leadership</p>

<p>Sir Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, is celebrating after his party drew level with the Conservatives in an opinion poll</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be hoping that  the figures in the YouGov poll are wrong and that his party is still in front of Labour</p>

<p>The Lib-Dems are unchanged on 6% over the same period.</p>

<p>One factor in Labour's rise to the same level as the Conservatives may be Sir Keir's attack on the Government's handling of the coronavirus issue.</p>

<p>The figures also show that 35% of people think Sir Keir would make the best PM compared to 30% in favour of Mr Johnson.</p>

<p>Statistics by YouGov also show that 38% of people asked think Sir Keir is a Prime Minister in waiting while 31% do not.</p>

<p>Many think that Sir Keir distancing himself from former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has helped his cause.</p>

<p>Out of those asked 35% thought that he had improved the party while only 4% thought that he had not.</p>

<p>Brexit, though, has proven to be a problem for Sir Keir, who was the party's shadow Brexit secretary, as many are still unsure about Labour's view on the topic.</p>

<p>The opposition leader has been careful not to get drawn into Mr Johnson's threats of reneging on parts of the Brexit withdrawal deal or the possibility of a no deal Brexit.</p>

<p>Despite this 49% of those asked for the YouGov poll said that they did not trust Labour to handle Britain's exit from the EU. Only 29% were in favour of Labour handling the issue.</p>

<p>Nearly 50 per cent of people on the YouGov poll said they did not trust Labour to handle Britain's leaving of the EU</p>

<p>On domestic issues the economy proved to be a problem for Labour. Only 13% felt that it was the issue that the part cared most about. This is compared to 40% of the public who feel it is the top priority.</p>
