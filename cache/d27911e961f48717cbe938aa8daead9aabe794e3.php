<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Work today continued on a 27-acre lorry park which will be able to hold up to 2,000 trucks when the Brexit transition period comes to an end this year.</p>

<p>The development, next to Junction 10a in Ashford, Kent, is being constructed by the Government as it prepares for the negotiation period to close in December.</p>

<p>Upon completion, the vast site will be used for HMRC customs checks, with an area available as a holding space for up to 2,000 trucks should delays at Dover arise.</p>

<p>However, it is hoped vehicles will not need to be stored on the land and it will be 'purely a customs checking site' by July.  </p>

<p>There are fears the UK could leave the EU without a free trade deal following the Brexit transition period, which could cause significant delays in vehicles crossing the border, Kent Live reported. </p>

<p>It was previously claimed failure to strike a Brexit deal by next month could mean up to 7,000 lorries would be forced to queue up ahead of crossing the Channel. </p>

<p>Photographs today captured the ongoing development of the site, with vehicles seen digging up the ground to make way for construction.</p>

<p>Queues of lorries were pictured on the M20 nearby as they waited to enter the Eurotunnel to Coquelles, France in Folkstone.</p>

<p>Construction on the site was halted last month after what was believed to be a Saxon wall was uncovered by workers, Kent Online reported.</p>

<p>The relic, which the Department for Transport later confirmed was not Saxon, caused work to be paused in an area close to the A2070 dual carriageway.</p>

<p>Work had continued elsewhere on the site, with orange fencing erected around the site still in place today.  </p>

<p>It emerged in July that the Department for Transport was looking to purchase the land in preparation for any potential trade disruptions as a result of Brexit.  </p>

<p>Transport Minister Rachel Maclean later confirmed the move, adding there were 'two primary uses' for the land.</p>

<p>It emerged in July that the Department for Transport was looking to purchase the land in preparation for any potential trade disruptions as a result of Brexit</p>

<p>She said: 'First, government departments envisage using it as a permanent site for facilities related to future border processes, notably HMRC (as an office of departure/arrival for goods moved under 'transit' arrangements) and Defra (as a border control post for goods needing sanitary and phytosanitary checks).</p>

<p>'Second, the site may also be used as a contingency lorry holding area for the particular, foreseeable risk of significant disruption at the end of the transition period.'</p>

<p>Ms Maclean added Downing Street had 'no intention' the site would become a permanent lorry holding facility for use in the event of 'cross-Channel disruption'.   </p>

<p>It is believed HMRC will use the land to check lorries until 2025.   </p>
