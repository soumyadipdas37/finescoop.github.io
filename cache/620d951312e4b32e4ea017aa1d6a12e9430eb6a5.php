<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kandice Barber, 35, is pictured at Aylesbury Crown Court in Buckinghamshire today</p>

<p>A married teacher had sex with a 15-year-old boy in a field and sent him topless pictures of herself on Snapchat which were then circulated around the school, a court heard today.</p>

<p>Kandice Barber, 35, also allegedly told the boy she might be pregnant with his baby after sleeping with him following a sports awards evening at a secondary school in Buckinghamshire. </p>

<p>Barber, who told police her account must have been hacked, has denied a series of charges involving the boy and including breaching a position of trust.</p>

<p>Her headmaster was said to have found out about her having sex with the boy after a topless picture of her was circulated around the secondary school. </p>

<p>Aylesbury Crown Court was told Barber approached the boy at a school sports awards day and added him on Snapchat.</p>

<p>Prosecutors alleged the teacher, then 33, had then picked up the youngster in her car and driven him to a secluded area where she had sex with him.</p>

<p>Jurors heard how the teacher, who had school-age children of her own, had later met up with the boy for two other illicit trysts and sent him pictures of herself topless, which were then widely shared around the school.</p>

<p>Richard Milne, prosecuting, said: 'This case is about an adult teacher having sexual relations with a pupil at the school where she taught.</p>

<p>Prosecutors alleged Barber (pictured outside Aylesbury Crown Court today) had picked up the youngster in her car and driven him to a secluded area where she had sex with him</p>

<p>'It all started at a sports evening on September 27, 2018 when she came over to him and asked to borrow his phone. </p>

<p>'She had possession of his phone, she put her details into his Snapchat account. He thought it was a bit weird as he was mates with her son, who was at the same school.</p>

<p>'Things developed on her part by her sending him messages. She would tell him she was having a bath or a shower and then ask him if he wanted to meet.</p>

<p>'She had driven over, he got into her car, she asked for somewhere private, he suggested some fields. It was 5pm in the evening on a school day.'</p>

<p>The court was told that Barber had sex with the boy and then later sent him topless pictures of herself, which were shown to the jury.</p>

<p>By the start of last year, the headmaster at her school came into possession of one of the topless pictures, which were circulating along with rumours of the affair.</p>

<p>Mr Milne added: 'He (the victim) was not proud of what happened, he was not showing off, it was not some sort of fantasy. He was extremely concerned and nervous when the rumours were going around.</p>

<p>'He knows that they did not have sex after his 16th birthday because she had proposed a hotel as a special treat for his 16th birthday, which he politely declined.'</p>

<p>In a video interview with police given on March 11 last year, the boy claimed the two had continued messaging for months after he turned 16 years old, only stopping because the school staff found out.</p>

<p>The complainant added that when called in to speak to his headmaster, he had initially denied that he had sex with Barber.</p>

<p>Speaking to a member of the child abuse team at Aylesbury police station, the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'I lied because she had told me she could be pregnant with my child and I began to panic. I lied to pretty much everyone except my friends.</p>

<p>'She said that if I was going to snitch, snake on her basically, she was going to bring me down with her. I was like, are you going to accuse me of rape? She was like, dot dot dot. Obviously I got angry and I did not talk to her after that.'</p>

<p>Barber was arrested on March 12 last year and during the interview she produced a prepared statement where she denied having sex with the boy, claimed her pregnancy was widely known around the school - although she later lost the baby - and the father was her husband.</p>

<p>A social worker attended Barber's home the following day and assessed her but during the visit Barber accepted having sent a naked picture to the boy, the jury heard.</p>

<p>Mr Milne told the jury: 'Mrs Barber told the social worker that she had started to talk to the boy in September 2018 on Snapchat. He had befriended her first. She denied having sexual intercourse with the boy but did admit sending the boy a picture of herself topless.</p>

<p>'She said that she was going through a bad patch with her husband, that she was pregnant but lost the child, they wanted another but it was not happening.</p>

<p>'Things were strained between her and her husband. The boy had paid her attention and she had let her guard down and started to talk to him.'</p>

<p>The court heard how the social worker had visited Barber again and the defendant had asked that what she had said not be included in any official reporting, adding she would deny having said it.</p>

<p>Mr Milne: 'The defence is likely to be that she, the defendant, did not engage in any sexual relationship with the complainant. In other words, it is simply made up.</p>

<p>'Although it may well be accepted that she, in social media terms, accepted a friend request sent by the complainant to help him out with a problem that he was having with one of his friends, it was he who kept on calling her and pursuing her in what may be described as an unhealthy manner and threatened to tell a teacher that something was going on.'</p>

<p>Barber, of Wendover, denied three counts of causing or inciting a child aged under 16 years to engage in a sexual act, one count of sexual communication with a child, one count of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activities while in a position of trust and one count of causing a child to watch a sexual act by a person in a position of trust.</p>

<p>Explaining the position of trust charges, Mr Milne said: 'In this jurisdiction, England and Wales, teachers are not permitted to have sexual relations with pupils and it is not to do with the age of consent, it is because they are in a position of trust, be they male or female.</p>

<p>'The law does not permit, indeed criminalises, any sexual activity between a teacher and a child under the age of 18 years, even if they were consensual relations.'</p>

<p>The hearing continues.</p>
