<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Muslim porter has successfully sued a five star country hotel for religious harassment after he won a bottle of Cognac in a raffle - but bosses gave him 'cheap' chocolate instead.</p>

<p>Managers at the 17th century hotel told Zakaria Kioua that 'giving a Muslim alcohol was like giving nuts to a person with a nut allergy', an employment tribunal heard.</p>

<p>Mr Kioua, who does not drink, replied 'religion is not an illness' and accused hotel staff of 'theft' for attempting to fob him off with 'cheap chocolates' rather than the French brandy.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old, who had originally trained as a vet in Algeria before moving to the UK, was working as a linen porter at the luxurious £400 a night Lainston House, near Winchester, Hants.</p>

<p>Zakaria Kioua who is teetotal, successfully sued the luxurious £400 a night Lainston House,  (pictured) near Winchester, Hants., for religious harassment after he won a bottle of Cognac in a raffle - but bosses gave him 'cheap' chocolate instead</p>

<p>At a staff party in January 2017 a raffle took place and although Mr Kioua was not at the event, a ticket he had purchased was drawn and he won a bottle of Cognac.</p>

<p>Two members of staff, who were handing out the prizes, realised Mr Kioua did not drink alcohol and 'on the spur of the moment' suggested he be given chocolate instead.</p>

<p>The housekeeping manager, Patricia Lee, accepted the swap on his behalf despite knowing that Mr Kioua had been given a bottle of Taittinger champagne as a present in the past.</p>

<p>Mr Kioua told the tribunal: 'As a human, I should have been asked. They know I do not have problems receiving alcohol.'</p>

<p>When he challenged Ms Lee about the 'cheap box of chocolates' he had been given instead of the expensive liquor, she was apparently 'dismissive'.</p>

<p>The employment tribunal, held in Southampton, Hants, heard Mr Kioua then accused Ms Lee of 'theft' for swapping the Cognac.</p>

<p>Mr Kioua was disgruntled after managers fobbed him off with cheap chocolates instead of the bottle of Cognac</p>

<p>A grievance meeting was held and manager Gaius Wyncoll claimed the gift had been 'tailored' to Mr Kioua and said it was a 'thoughtful gesture' that had nothing to do with religion.</p>

<p>He added: '[If] someone has got a nut allergy or a nut intolerance and they were given a box of chocolates that contains nuts do you not feel it would be appropriate that we then change that prize, you know, on the night?'</p>

<p>Mr Kioua rejected that explanation and replied: 'It's different. They don't want that prize to be going to me and they've used my religion to get what they want.'</p>

<p> He told Mr Wyncoll that 'a religion or belief is not an illness'.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, his grievance was dismissed and he was told the swap had absolutely 'no connection to religious beliefs'.</p>

<p>The disgruntled porter launched an appeal, which was again thrown out, although he was offered a replacement bottle of Cognac and told 'no offence was intended'.</p>

<p>A short while later, Mr Kioua was forced to go home to look after his sick mother and due to other health issues, he ended up taking a significant amount of time off work.</p>

<p>Despite help from the hotel, which offered him substantial support, Mr Kioua resigned in April 2019.</p>

<p>An employment tribunal heard managers at the 17th century hotel (pictured) told Zakaria Kioua that 'giving a Muslim alcohol was like giving nuts to a person with a nut allergy'</p>

<p>Mr Kioua launched a number of claims against the hotel after his resignation, including victimisation, failure to make reasonable adjustments in respect of disability and constructive unfair dismissal, but all were dismissed.</p>

<p>However, the tribunal awarded him £2,294 in respect of injury to feelings for the Cognac incident and determined Mr Kioua's claim of harassment related to religion or belief succeeded.</p>

<p>Employment judge Street concluded: 'A nut allergy is an illness, a life-threatening illness. It is not an acceptable point of comparison. It minimises the importance of Mr Kioua's beliefs and practices.</p>

<p>'The point is not that [the swap] was well-intentioned. The point is that it should not have been said, just as the decision should not have been made to change Mr Kioua's prize.</p>

<p>'Both are on the grounds of his religion and neither should have happened; both are offensive and caused him distress.'</p>
