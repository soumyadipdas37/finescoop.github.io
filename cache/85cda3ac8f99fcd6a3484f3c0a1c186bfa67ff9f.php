<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the amazing moment an octopus amazed a diver with its incredible colour-changing camouflage as it hid in plain view.</p>

<p>Footage was captured by a free-diver as he swam in the crystal clear waters in the French Riviera. </p>

<p>As the diver swims through the water, he uses his hand to point to floor and what appears to be rocks and seaweed. </p>

<p>Footage was captured by a free-diver as he swam in the crystal clear waters in the French Riviera</p>

<p>Heading down to the bottom, the diver swims through seaweed before focusing the camera on ragged mass of rock.</p>

<p>But the rock does not appear to be what it seems, as suddenly an octopus bursts off the rock and swims off into hiding, squirting ink as it flees.</p>

<p>The incredible octopus interchanged between its natural brown complexion and the deep-sea green of its surroundings.</p>

<p>It had settled on a spot and changed colour in order to blend seamlessly with the surrounding reef.</p>

<p>Octopuses are highly-intelligent beasts that have evolved to master their marine environment and are unique in the animal kingdom for many reasons - having three hearts, for example. </p>

<p>Camouflage is just one of their remarkable methods of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Octopuses are part of the family cephalapods, which includes squid and cuttlefish and many of these animals have chromataphores in their skin.</p>

<p>These special pigment cells allow them to control the colour of their skin, much like chameleons.</p>

<p>They can also change the texture of their skin to better blend in.</p>

<p>The diver said: 'During a freedive in the French Riviera, approaching gently around the Posidonia, the octopus uses his best camouflage. When he saw me he changed colors and disappeared.' </p>
