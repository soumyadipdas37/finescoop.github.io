<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Southampton have opened talks with Danny Ings over a new long-term contract.</p>

<p>The Saints want to secure the future of their star striker Ings after he produced the best season of his career which has also earned him an England recall last week after a five-year absence.  </p>

<p>Ings, 28, has under two years left of his current £65,000-per-week deal at St Mary’s.</p>

<p>Southampton have started talks with their star striker Danny Ings regarding a new contract</p>

<p>But he is on the list of players Southampton have earmarked for improved terms as they bid to continue their new contract drive.</p>

<p>Initial discussions with Ings have taken place though no agreement has yet been reached.</p>

<p>Ings, released by Southampton as a schoolboy, rejoined from Liverpool in 2018, initially on loan.</p>

<p>The Saints are eager to tie Ings down after he scored 25 goals during the 2019-20 campaign</p>

<p>Ralph Hasenhuttl is determined for Southampton to keep Ings, whose contract expires in 2022</p>

<p>The £20m move became a permanent one last summer and Ings emerged as Southampton’s talisman, scoring 25 times in all competitions.</p>

<p>His 22 league goals helped haul Southampton away from relegation trouble and to a respectable 11th placed finish. He missed out on a share of the golden boot by just one goal.</p>

<p>Since manager Ralph Hasenhüttl signed a new four-year deal in June, Shane Long, Will Smallbone, Nathan Tella, Jake Vokins and captain James Ward-Prowse have all committed their futures to Southampton.</p>

<p>As well as Ings, discussions have also been held over a new contract for left-back Ryan Bertrand.</p>
