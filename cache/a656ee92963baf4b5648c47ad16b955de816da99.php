<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Victorian government will try to keep secret the data it analysed before deciding to continue Melbourne's strict curfew.</p>

<p>Mornington Peninsula cafe owner Michelle Loielo is suing the government, claiming Covid-19 restrictions have caused a 99 per cent drop in her revenue.</p>

<p>The case will go to trial in the Supreme Court on Monday and Ms Loielo's lawyers argue that data which informed the government's decision-making should be made public.</p>

<p>Michelle Loielo (right) filed a suit in Victoria's Supreme Court on Tuesday, saying she has lost 99 per cent of business under the tough restrictions</p>

<p>Earlier this month Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured) said he decided to bring in the unprecedented 8pm curfew even though it was not recommended by scientists</p>

<p>But the state will try to keep the data secret under a public interest immunity claim to be made next week, reported the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Victoria's Deputy Public Health Commander Michelle Giles, who approved the extension of the lockdown and curfew on 14 September, said in court documents submitted on Tuesday that her decision was informed by government data.</p>

<p>Professor Giles claimed the data showed 'a clear and direct correlation' between stage four restrictions lower Covid-19 case numbers.</p>

<p>Ms Loielo's lawyer Vanessa Plain said: 'It is critical that data be produced and is before the court so we may test the way in which Dr Giles reached the conclusion the orders were rational.' </p>

<p>Earlier this month Premier Daniel Andrews said he decided to bring in the unprecedented 8pm curfew even though it was not recommended by scientists.  </p>

<p>'That's a decision that I've made,' he said on 10 September, adding that governments are 'free to go beyond' advice given to them by doctors. </p>

<p>The previous day Victoria's chief health officer Brett Sutton said he did not recommend the curfew.  </p>

<p>Ms Loielo, a Liberal Party supporter, claims the curfew violates her rights to freedom.</p>

<p>She says her business in Capel Sound used to bring in up to $20,000 a week in earnings.</p>

<p>The curfew, which affects metropolitan Melbourne, originally required people to stay home between 8pm and 5am, but was pushed back to 9pm from Monday</p>

<p>'Last week I made $400,' she wrote in a court document supporting her claim last week.</p>

<p>'This situation troubles me greatly, as I am the sole financial provider for my three children and I am genuinely concerned that I am not going to be able to provide for my children if this situation continues. I am afraid that I will lose my house.'</p>

<p>Ms Loielo said the business was running at a loss, and trying to keep it afloat while caring for her children had taken a significant toll on her health.</p>

<p>In a post on her restaurant website on August 8, Ms Loielo said the industry had taken an 'absolute beating' in 2020 and she had had to remodel, reshuffle and rethink everything to do with her business.</p>

<p>'To this end, I have become heavily involved in local politics and discussions and am even taking a crack at being preselected to run for the next state election in the seat of Nepean for the Liberal Party,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Court documents, filed by Marcus Clarke QC, argue the curfew direction is invalid on grounds of irrationality and illogicality.</p>

<p>Mr Clarke has previously provided expert advice to Victoria's state opposition over the legality of changes to Victoria's state of emergency, which has been extended.</p>

<p>In an originating motion he says the curfew is not reasonably proportionate, and not based on relevant and reliable evidence in line with public health laws.</p>

<p>It says Victoria's Deputy Public Health Commander, Associate Professor Michelle Giles, 'failed to give any real independent consideration to whether it was appropriate to make the curfew'.</p>

<p>Ms Loielo, the DHHS and shadow attorney-general Edward O'Donohue have been contacted for comment.</p>
