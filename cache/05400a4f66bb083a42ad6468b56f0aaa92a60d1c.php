<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern has finally revealed the two steps that need to be taken before a trans-Tasman travel bubble can go ahead. </p>

<p>Leaders in both Australia and New Zealand have been working hard to carve out a plan to allow residents to travel between both nations without having to quarantine.</p>

<p>The aim is to have the bubble up and running by early next year. </p>

<p>But Ms Ardern says her government needs assurance there is minimal risk of the virus being brought into New Zealand from Australia. </p>

<p>Speaking to the Today Show on Wednesday, she said Australia needs to define what it means by a 'coronavirus hotspot'. </p>

<p>The nation would also need to establish plans of containment in place should another outbreak occur across states, she said.</p>

<p>'What you can see is that we do want to make it work, we want it to be safe we want everyone to be comfortable with it and know that we are safeguarding our own strategies as we do it,' she said. </p>

<p>'What we will need to work through is what the definition of a hot spot really means? At what point will Australia say, ''That's an area we will put up a bit of a border around and won't have travel to''. </p>

<p>'That will determine whether or not in our minds that will be sufficient just to keep everybody safe.' </p>

<p>She said the government is open to making separate agreements with states with low or no cases to help boost the tourism industry. </p>

<p>New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern has finally revealed the two steps that need to be taken before a tran-Tasman travel bubble can go ahead</p>

<p>NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would be happy to be the first state to welcome Kiwis back. </p>

<p>Australia and New Zealand have discussed the possibility of a 'trans-Tasman bubble'.</p>

<p>The bubble would allow residents from both countries to travel across the ditch without having to endure a mandatory 14-day isolation period.</p>

<p>The idea has been raised as both countries have been successful in controlling the outbreak of the coronavirus. </p>

<p>She said she felt comfortable to be looking at these opportunities as it would be a boost to the hospitality and tourism industries.</p>

<p>'New Zealand has very low cases, I don't mean it in a disrespectful way, but they're like another state of Australia when you look at the number of cases,' she said.   </p>

<p>On Tuesday, Mr Morrison said people flying into Australia from overseas could soon be allowed to quarantine at home, asking officials to look into the proposal.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern said New Zealand was unlikely to follow suit, saying 'quarantine-free travel is our version of that'.</p>

<p>'I do think there's something to be said at looking at the other end, thinking about whether or not for high-risk countries we need to have, an additional element of extra self-isolation,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern said opening up to Pacific nations - beginning with the Cook Islands - was 'absolutely' still part of New Zealand's re-engagement with the world.</p>

<p>'The threshold that we'll set will meet the Cooks' expectations,' she said.</p>
