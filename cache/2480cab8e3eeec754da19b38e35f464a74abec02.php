<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Incredible footage has shown the fascinating moment a seal uses the ring water pool at the Noboribetsu Marine Park Nixe in Japan.  </p>

<p>The aquarium's official Twitter account shared the short clip, which was filmed in June 2020, and captures the moment a seal swims into the circular fixture, rising into the air before diving headfirst into the pool. </p>

<p>And thanks to the see-through structure of the pool ring, it gives the illusion that the seal is swimming in the air.  </p>

<p>The aquarium, one of the largest in northern Japan, is located in Castle Nixe, modeled after a Danish castle, where visitors can see everything from sharks, giant octopus and salmon. </p>

<p>Noboribetsu Marine Park is home to around 20,000 animals in 400 different species and boasts a display of both local and exotic marine life. </p>

<p>Visitors can enjoy walking through Crystal Tower in Castle Nixe, an eight meter high fish tank that features a Napoleon Fish.  </p>

<p>They can also gain close encounters with creatures like penguins and dolphins, and admire the unique castle-like structure of the aquarium. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, visitors can witness the sardine light show at the Milky Way Pool - which features over 10,000 sardines swimming in unison.</p>

<p>There's also a daily dolphin show which takes place in the all-weather pools, and those keen to do so, can also learn to train them.</p>

<p>Other attractions include a touch pool with small sharks and rays, a reptile house with snakes, turtles and lizards, a game arcade and a selection of children's rides. </p>
