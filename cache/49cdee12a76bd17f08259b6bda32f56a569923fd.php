<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chris Robshaw bid an emotional and bittersweet home farewell to his beloved Harlequins on Monday.</p>

<p>The former England captain and club legend pulled the curtain down on his illustrious Stoop career, revealing in a poignant post-match TV interview that playing for the west London side had been all he had ever dreamed of.</p>

<p>But Robshaw, who earned 66 caps for his country, 43 of them as captain, missed out on the hero's send-off he deserved with the match played behind closed doors because of Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>Club legend and captain Chris Robshaw has played his last home game for Harlequins</p>

<p>The former England captain was denied a winning ending in his final home outingÂ </p>

<p>'I feel emotional. Last time out at the Stoop without the opportunity to share it with the fans,' Robshaw told BT Sport.</p>

<p>'I'm sad I don't get to share this with them.'</p>

<p>The back-row star was also denied a winning result in what was his 299th club appearance as Wasps battled back to beat his 14-man side 32-23 in the Premiership.</p>

<p>We weren't quite ready to sobbing on a Monday night ðŸ’”Chris Robshaw reflects on a phenomenal career after his final appearance at The Stoop..."I'm sad I don't get to share this with the fans.""It's all I've ever known, and all I've wanted to know." pic.twitter.com/N2iyIXPxF5</p>

<p>The 34-year-old, who joined the club's academy as a 17-year-old, admitted: 'In sport we don't always get the fairytales we dream about and always hope for.</p>

<p>'Of course you always want to win more and be more successful but for me itâ€™s been a hell of a ride. In sport, you take the good times with the bad times.</p>

<p>'Iâ€™ve loved my time here but it goes quickly. In the blink of an eye you are a 17-year-old kid playing out here and 16/17 years later itâ€™s all over.</p>

<p>'Iâ€™m sure there will be days when I look back with fond memories.'</p>

<p>Robshaw has spent his entire career with Harlequins and is set for a new challenge in USA</p>

<p>Robshaw revealed he is now looking ahead to a new challenge playing for US Rugby side San Diego Legion.</p>

<p>But he admits he knew it was time to quit top-flight English rugby. 'I think you know in your mind and body when the timeâ€™s right and for me it feels right,' he added.</p>

<p>'For me itâ€™s now about looking forward to a new opportunity in my life â€“ me and my wife going Stateside and enjoying a bit of California sun, playing a bit of rugby and having a bit of fun.'</p>

<p>Robshaw will play his last ever game for Harlequins - his 300th in all competitions - in Sunday's Premiership match at Leicester.</p>

<p>And he revealed helping Harlequins bank their first and only Premiership title in the 2011-12 season was a personal highlight during his long club stint.</p>

<p>'To lift the only kind of Premiership cup we have, it doesn't get any more special for that for a boy who supported and captained the club,' he added.</p>

<p>'It's all I've ever known and all I've wanted to know. I feel truly honoured.'</p>
