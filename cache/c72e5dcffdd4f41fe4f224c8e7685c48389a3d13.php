<p>Looking good: Irena showed off her leggy figure in a leopard print dress and black mule heels. She accessorised with a black leather jacket </p>

<p>Gentleman: Locky carried the girls' handbags, allowing them to catch up freely </p>

<p>Bel opted for a green floral print wrap top, that revealed her delicate décolletage, teamed with a gold silk skirt and black pointy-toe heels.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty allowed her wavy locks to flow in the breeze, and kept her makeup fresh and natural. </p>

<p>Locky appeared all too happy to carry the girls' handbags, allowing them to catch up freely in front.</p>

<p>Sweet gesture: Locky, who cut a suave figure on the night, gave Irena his grey suit jacket to wear</p>

<p>Proud: Locky pointed to a sign that read 'school of nursing' in a nod to Irena's chosen career path. The pair locked lips </p>

<p>Smitten: Locky had no qualms in packing on the PDA with Irena, warmly embracing her and gazing adoringly into her eyes </p>

<p>The former Australian Survivor star cut a suave figure in a crisp white dress shirt, navy slim-fit pants, a grey suit jacket and pristine white sneakers.</p>

<p>During the night, Locky managed to steal Irena away for a quick moment, locking lips in an inner city street.</p>

<p>Ever the gentleman, he ensured Irena was kept warm, with the beauty seen sporting his grey suit jacket. </p>

<p>On Thursday, a conflicted Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant during The Bachelor's emotional finale. </p>

<p>See that? Locky could not wipe the smile off his face during the outing </p>

<p>'I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you': Locky chose Irena as his winning contestant on Thursday's finale episode of The Bachelor</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you... I feel so safe and protected, and it's kind of weird, 'cause I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that, but just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable,' he told her.</p>

<p>'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.' </p>
