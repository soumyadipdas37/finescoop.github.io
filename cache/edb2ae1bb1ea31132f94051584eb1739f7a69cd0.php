<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Househunters could snap up a three-bedroom home for less than the cost of a brand new car.</p>

<p>A property at 29 Monash Avenue at Underbool in Victoria's northwest is up for sale for only $60,000.</p>

<p>But the low price has already attracted eight purchase offers and racked up more than 10,000 views for the property's online listing.</p>

<p>A property at 29 Monash Avenue at Underbool in Victoria's north west is up for sale for only $60,000</p>

<p>This is despite the property's location in a tiny farming community with a population of just 215 people. </p>

<p>The real drawcard seems to be the home's distance from major cities, and ease of access to nature including the renowned Pink Lakes and the Murray River. </p>

<p>While the town has a primary school and general store, it is 150km south of Mildura and 476km north west of Melbourne.</p>

<p>Underbool's only pub has also been closed for the last two years, but the watering hole is also up for sale for interested buyers. </p>

<p>Realtor Ian Miers from Burns &amp; Co Mildura said the coronavirus pandemic has been driving buyers out of major cities and into the countryside. </p>

<p>The three-bedroom home sits on a 1244sqm block of land with a massive backyard and a water tank</p>

<p>As an added bonus buyers can move into the home fully furnished</p>

<p>'And with the COVID-19 situation in Melbourne, the last three properties I've sold, in Ouyen, were all to people escaping Melbourne,' Mr Miers told realestate.com.au. </p>

<p>Those looking to purchase the property include buyers from Canberra, and those from the bushfire affected town of Cann River in East Gippsland.  </p>

<p>The three-bedroom home sits on a 1244sqm block of land - around three times the average lot size in Melbourne's greenfield estate.</p>

<p>The $60,000 price tag is also 12.5 times less than Melbourne's median house price of $750,000.</p>

<p>Mr Miers said the house has a big backyard and comes with the bonus of an antique oven which could fetch a decent price on its own.  </p>

<p>The home has three bedrooms and two bathrooms</p>

<p>'(The house has) a lovely big backyard, 11ft (3.35m) ceilings, and a fair bit of charm and character about it,' Mr Miers said.</p>

<p>'It has a magnificent old slow-combustion stove in it — if I pulled that out, I could probably sell it for $3,000-$4,000.'</p>

<p>As an added bonus buyers can move into the home fully furnished, with all kitchenware included.</p>

<p>The home also features two bathrooms, a full width verandah which is covered at the rear, a butler's pantry, and a water tank.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the town pub is also up for sale at around double the price of $170,000 - $187,000</p>

<p>Meanwhile the town pub is also up for sale at an asking price of around $170,000 - $187,000.</p>

<p>Underbool has sold three properties for the $60,000 mark from July 2016 January 2017.</p>

<p>Several dilapidated properties also sold in the town for less than $10,000 in 2015 which were set for demolition. </p>
