<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father-of-two has been found guilty of sexually assaulting four women he met on dating apps over a five-month period.</p>

<p>David Gabrieli was found guilty of 19 assault and sexual misconduct charges after incidents with four women in his apartment in Maroubra in Sydney's east between August 2017 and January 2018.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old posed as a doctor on Bumble and RSVP to lure the women to him as part of his 'modus operandi' to engage in sexual activity.</p>

<p>NSW District Court heard Gabrieli held each woman by the wrist and made them touch his penis, with one victim saying she was detained for 10 minutes.</p>

<p>When Gabrieli said the victim could not leave until she calmed down, she replied 'you’re going to have to let me go at some stage, you can’t keep me here forever,' the court heard, news.com.au reported.</p>

<p>Gabrili's charges included indecent assault, sexual intercourse without consent and aggravated sexual assault inflicting actual bodily harm on the victim. </p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Sally Traynor said Gabrieli was relentless in following his twisted plan to assume sexual activity despite his victims' refusals.</p>

<p>Ms Traynor said he 'was not prepared to deviate from it at all, even when the complainants said no'. </p>

<p>'You would utterly reject the evidence you heard from the accused that they were willing participants in the sexual events and in that all four cases the events unexpectedly turned sour,' she said. </p>

<p>Ms Traynor said Gabrieli would use tactics to get the women into his home - including meeting at coffee shops that were closed, faking illness or pretending he was on call at a hospital.</p>

<p>Defence barrister Mark Brady noted to the jury that all four women had attended Gabrieli's apartment willingly on their first date. </p>

<p>Gabrieli was remanded in custody before his sentencing on November 20.</p>
