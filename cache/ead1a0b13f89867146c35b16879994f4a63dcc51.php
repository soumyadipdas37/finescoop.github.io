<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Sydney mother stranded in an African city dubbed the 'rape capital of the world' has finally returned home.</p>

<p>Melissa Inkster, 44, flew into the Democratic Republic of Congo on March 16 to help set up a charity with her fiance Joseph in the Tshopo province in the country's east.</p>

<p>Eight days later the DRC shut its borders as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold globally, leaving Ms Inkster separated from her two young children back home on Sydney's northern beaches. </p>

<p>She flew to the capital Kinshasa in early August after the DRC's government lifted international border restrictions.</p>

<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to get on a plane, she finally boarded the first of four flights home at Kinshasa International Airport on Monday after friends and family helped raised $15,000 to get her back to Australia.</p>

<p>Ms Inkster briefly spoke to Daily Mail Australia while in transit in Frankfurt, Germany on Tuesday, where she expressed relief that she finally was on her way home and being reunited with her young sons for the first time in six months.</p>

<p>She also looked forward to sharing her story with the public after she touched down in Sydney on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Melissa Inkster (pictured on her way home) is now in quarantine in a Sydney hotel</p>

<p>'OMG I AM HOME,' she posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>But it will be another two weeks before she's reunited with her sons as she undergoes mandatory hotel quarantine.  </p>

<p>Ms Inkster uploaded a video filmed on a flight, where she emotionally thanked her friends, family and the Australian public for their support and help in getting her home. </p>

<p>'The good thing is I can't wait to see my kids Max and Tomas and just hug them,' she says in the video.</p>

<p>'I just don't know when I'll let them go. I think they're going to fight me on that one.</p>

<p>'I love you all, thank you so much. I still can't believe this is happening.' </p>

<p>Ms Inkster previously opened up to Daily Mail Australia about her nightmare as she desperately tried to escape the continent. </p>

<p>Melissa Inkster (pictured) thanked friends, family and the Australian public for their support</p>

<p>Her life savings have been completely drained by being trapped in the country for so long. </p>

<p>Adding further to her pain, in the week prior to her leaving the regional city of Kisangani she fainted and suffered a miscarriage.</p>

<p>In the same week, she had been robbed of her purse as she went shopping and was then confronted by a man with a knife when she got home. </p>

<p>Ms Inkster was supposed to board a flight home from Kinshasa on Saturday, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo , but was bumped off</p>

<p>Melissa Inkster, 44, has been stuck in the Democratic Republic of Congo since March - unable to get a flight home to her two children</p>

<p>The man pulled a large blade on them and had attempted to corner Ms Inkster before her fiance Joe Bagala jumped in front of her to scare the attacker away. </p>

<p>Ms Inkster had faced a number of flight cancellations to flee the Congo.</p>

<p>Friends and family raised more than $15,000 to fly the mother home on business class through an online fundraiser after she boarded a regional flight from the Congo surrounded by goats in the freezing cold. </p>

<p>Ms Inkster's travel agent secured her a flight leaving the country on August 15 but an administrative issue meant the airline did not receive confirmation for the second leg of her journey. </p>

<p>The mother - who does not have access to JobKeeper because she is outside Australia - had an anxious wait before she finally left the country on Sunday.</p>

<p>She said the hotel she has paid for in the city was costing her $1,300 for a week despite the relative poverty of the country.</p>

<p>Sydney is receiving just 350 international arrivals a day and Victoria has suspended them altogether amid its horror coronavirus second wave.  </p>

<p>Ms Inkster pictured with her children Tomas, nine, and Max, six. She said one of the most painful parts of being stuck halfway around the world is not being able to hug her children</p>

<p>'Do they want me to be stranded in a third-world country?' she previously told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'I'm one of thousands in a precarious situation. I haven't chosen to stay here for as long as I have.</p>

<p>'People say things like "they've had a chance to come home already" but it's not my fault.</p>

<p>'I've now got to find a $3000 quarantine fee from somewhere and we have no money.'   </p>

<p>Ms Inkster said she was 'dumbfounded' why the Australian government were leaving her to languish in a country as dangerous as the DRC - which is ranked 179th in the world in the Human Development Index.</p>

<p>'Being a white woman is particularly dangerous but being alone as a white woman in Kingshasa is really dangerous. I cannot leave the hotel I'm in alone - I have to make sure I have an escort at all times.'</p>

<p>She said she and her fiance had originally planned to return to Australia and live at her home in Curl Curl while renting out his property in Leichhardt in the city's inner-west.</p>

<p>Ms Inkster and her partner Joseph travelled to Africa via Europe in March for business. They have together set up a charity to help impoverished people in the DRC's capital</p>

<p>'People say things like 'they've had a chance to come home already' but it's not my fault,' the mother said</p>

<p>Ms Inkster set up a charity in the central African country with the aim of improving the lives of people within one of its impoverished regions</p>

<p>'I should write a book about what has happened, we were here to do good for a few weeks and now we're stuck here,' Ms Inkster said</p>

<p>The draining financial impact of being unable to get out of the DRC for so long though depleted her savings to such a point she considered renting out her home.    </p>

<p>'It's been extremely tough – we've got no money we've had to try to get some from family and friends to support us,' she said.</p>

<p>Her fiance - who works in the construction industry and was appointed as the chief of the village they have worked to lift out of poverty - had to stay behind in regional DRC. </p>

<p>'If he could have flown with me we would have but we don't have the money,' she said. </p>

<p>'I should write a book about what has happened, we were here to do good for a few weeks and now we're stuck here.</p>

<p>'We are actually really open to writing a documentary about it.'</p>

<p>Her partner works in the construction industry and was appointed as the chief of the village they have helped lift out of poverty</p>

<p>Ms Inkster's efforts to get back to Australia have been stifled by the government's caps on international passenger arrivals</p>

<p>Perhaps most painful of all though was not being able to hug her children. </p>

<p>'My son Tomas used to call me crying asking me when I'm coming home. Their Dad is doing a great job looking after them while I'm gone but they need their Mum,' she said.   </p>

<p>Ms Inkster spoke to her sons on Skype as much as she could to ask them how their lives are going, but did not go into detail about her situation so she didn't confuse them. </p>

<p>A senior UN official declared the African nation to be the 'rape capital of the world' in 2010.</p>

<p>'Women have no rights, if those who violate their rights go unpunished,' Margot Wallström, the Secretary-General's Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict said at the time.</p>

<p>The comments drew the attention of researchers, advocates and journalists and Congo is still known as the 'rape capital' in media reports due to widespread sexual violence.  </p>

<p>The GoFundMe fundraiser set up to help Ms Inkster explains she and her partner travelled to Africa with the intention to go on to Europe in March for business. </p>

<p>'Mel and her fiancé spent their time in Africa creating a charity and working with locals to improve many aspects of their lives and will continue working in these areas along with new business ideas when they are safely back home,' the page says.</p>

<p>'Mel has two young boys in the Australia who she is desperate to get back too. They need her and she needs them.' </p>

<p>'Mel is a kindhearted woman giving to all she meets and wouldn't hesitate to help another Mum get home.</p>

<p>'The government isn't helping and she is stuck in Africa alone which is also incredibly dangerous.' </p>

<p>Mr Bagala said despite some of their negative experiences the couple had a lot of love and respect for the Congolese people.</p>

<p>'99 per cent of people in the Congo are amazing. They are a beautiful people who deserve development and a better life,' he said. </p>

<p>At the 25th National Cabinet meeting on August 7, the government decided to extend caps on international passenger arrivals 'to manage and maintain quarantine arrangements across jurisdictions'. </p>

<p>International flights into Victoria have been suspended as the state attempts to control their active infections. </p>

<p>Sydney is taking in a maximum of 350 arrivals each day, while Perth is limited to 525 each week.</p>

<p>Ms Inkster and her partner are stranded in different parts of the DRC because they did not have the money to get him home too</p>

<p>There is a limit of 500 passengers in both Brisbane and Adelaide, while passenger limits on flights in Canberra and Darwin are 'discussed with jurisdictions on a case-by-case basis'. </p>

<p>A DFAT spokesperson said: 'The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade stands ready to provide consular assistance to any Australian citizen, should they request it.'  </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne and Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton for comment.</p>

<p>National Cabinet agreed on August 7 that existing caps on international passenger arrivals would continue 'in order to manage and maintain quarantine arrangements across jurisdictions'. </p>

<p>The following will apply until 24 October subject to further advice on quarantine capacity:</p>

<p>The suspension of international flights into Melbourne will also continue.</p>
