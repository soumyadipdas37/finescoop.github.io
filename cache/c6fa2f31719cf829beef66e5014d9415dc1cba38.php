<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ralph Hasenhuttl insists Danny Ings has 'zero interest' in leaving Southampton and dismissed suggestions of the player being sold to Tottenham as 'absolutely nonsense'.</p>

<p>Spurs have reportedly made an enquiry for Ings, who was recently recalled by England after hitting 25 goals for Saints last term.</p>

<p>Ahead of Sunday's meeting with Jose Mourinho's men, Southampton manager Hasenhuttl said: 'The only thing I want to say for these rumours is that there's absolutely zero interest from Danny to go anywhere.</p>

<p>Tottenham are believed to be interested in signing Danny Ings to strengthen up-front</p>

<p>Ralph Hasenhuttl has slammed the claims saying Ings is happy to stay at Southampton</p>

<p>'He is 100 per cent happy to be here and, for us, it's 100 per cent not discussable that we (allow to) leave one of the best strikers in Europe.</p>

<p>'Any rumours about that are absolutely nonsense and hopefully this is the last time we speak about this.'</p>

<p>Ings has become Southampton's star performer since joining his boyhood club from Liverpool.</p>

<p>Ings scored 25 goals in 42 appearances across all competitions for Southampton last season</p>

<p>Hasenhuttl believes the 28-year-old would prefer to be the main man at St Mary's than become a squad player elsewhere.</p>

<p>'To be an alternative for another club or being here, the most important striker in our team - one of our own if you want - then you know how much he likes to be here,' said the Austrian.</p>

<p>'He loves what we do here, he loves to play for us and the team loves to play with him.'</p>
