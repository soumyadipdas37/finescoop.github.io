<p>Off she goes! The Strictly Come Dancing presenter took to Instagram to share the sad news with fans, as the annual telethon reaches its 40th Anniversary in November</p>

<p>'Pudsey and what he represents will always hold a special place in my heart but it's time to pass the presenting baton over as the show reaches it's amazing 40-year milestone. </p>

<p>'That's four decades of the British public donating and heroically fundraising over £1bn towards changing children's lives for the better. </p>

<p>'But Children In Need isn't just an annual event, it works tirelessly all year round and I'm excited that I will continue to work alongside some of the vitally important projects that this extraordinary charity supports, seeing first-hand what a profound affect these unprecedented times have had, and to find out what more we can do to help.'</p>

<p>Moving on: In the post Tess shared several snaps from her time on Children In Need, including one with co-host Ade Adepitan</p>

<p>Tess joined the Children In Need team in 2008 when she hosted alongside Terry and Fearne Cotton.</p>

<p>Following Terry's death in 2016 she has joined forces with a slew of different presenters, including Rochelle and Marvin Humes, Graham Norton and Tom Allen.</p>
