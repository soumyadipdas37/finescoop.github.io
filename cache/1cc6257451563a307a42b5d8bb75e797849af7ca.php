<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia's newest $1 coin was made specifically to be donated, but it remains to be seen how many people take that to heart.</p>

<p>The Royal Australian Mint has coined the 'Donation Dollar', a green-centred version of the currency, in time for International Day of Charity on September 5. </p>

<p>'Give to help others' is engraved on the gold coin. </p>

<p>The Mint expects three in five Australians to donate the $1 coin when they see it amongst their change.</p>

<p>The Royal Australian Mint has coined the 'Donation Dollar', a green-centred version of the currency, in time for International Day of Charity on September 5</p>

<p>If all Australians donated the coin then an eye-watering $300million a year would be raised for those less fortunate, Business Insider Australia reported.</p>

<p>'The Royal Australian Mint has a rich heritage of producing coins to meet the needs of every Australian,' Royal Mint CEO Ross MacDiarmid said in a statement. </p>

<p>'So we're extremely proud to introduce the world's first Donation Dollar and tap into the Australian spirit of generosity. </p>

<p>'Like any other one dollar coin, the cycle of a Donation Dollar is ongoing, as is its potential for positive impact.'</p>

<p>The Mint is set to produce 25million coins, one for every Australian resident, to help those in need. Three million of the coins were released on Wednesday. </p>

<p>The Mint expects three in five Australians to donate the $1 coin when they see it amongst their change (stock)</p>

<p>It was estimated that more than 80 per cent of Australians have donated money to charity or a cause in the past year, but 70 per cent admitted they often forgot or lacked time to do so.</p>

<p>The twin shocks of coronavirus pandemic on the heels of a catastrophic bushfire season triggered an upswell of generosity peaking in December.</p>

<p>However, a report by JBWere estimates donations will fall 18 per cent over the next two years due to the economic fallout of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Australia has about 57,000 charities and not-for-profits all vying for attention.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the Donation Dollar will prompt people to change their behaviour and donate smaller amounts more often, not just in times of crisis.</p>

<p>CCA chair Tim Costello said the Donation Dollar arrives at a time when many Australians needed a helping hand.</p>

<p>'There's no doubt in my mind this is a gift that will benefit those who are most vulnerable in our nation,' he said.</p>
