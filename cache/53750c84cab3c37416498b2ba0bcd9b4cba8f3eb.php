<p>Van de Beek was due to link up with the Holland national team this week ahead of Nations League games against Poland and Italy, but has delayed his arrival in order to complete his United medical.</p>

<p>He is set to receive a significant upgrade on his current £30,000-a-week wages as he prepares to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men for the 2020-21 season.</p>

<p>Tottenham reportedly made a last-ditch attempt to sign Van de Beek, but he was eager to join United after being convinced by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
