<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A primary school has been slammed by furious parents after revealing plans to finish at lunchtime on Fridays to save cash and give teachers more planning time.   </p>

<p>Stanley Road Primary School in Worcester sent a letter to parents suggesting their children will finish classes at 1.15pm on Fridays from December.</p>

<p>But the proposal has enraged parents and governors, who insisted students have already missed out on too much schooling due to the coronavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>Some have claimed they will lose money by having to cut their working day in half to collect their children from school earlier. </p>

<p>The measure has been dubbed 'Poets Day' - urban slang for 'P*** Off Early Tomorrow's Saturday'.</p>

<p>It comes as Stanley Road Primary was yesterday forced to send pupils home to self-isolate after an individual at the school tested positive for Covid-19.  </p>

<p>Children who have been in close contact with the positive case received a letter informed them they must remain at home for two weeks.      </p>

<p>Julie Beavers, 40, whose daughter attends the school said she has 'really missed learning and seeing her friends' throughout lockdown.  </p>

<p>'When the school re-opened in September there was a chance for the kids to get back to some kind of normal routine again but this early Friday finish is a kick in the teeth,' she said.</p>

<p>'The kids are already behind in their learning with the amount they missed during the lockdown. This feels like the school is going part-time.</p>

<p>'My partner and I also work full-time which means one of us will have to cut their hours to pick my daughter up at lunchtime on Fridays.'</p>

<p>Another father, who did not wish to be named, added: 'I have sympathy with the teachers but why do they need more time to plan lessons?</p>

<p>'Aside from the lockdown, they have a lot more holiday than the rest of us.</p>

<p>'It's a joke to chip off early on Friday, especially after spending six months at home during the lockdown.</p>

<p>'We'd all like to have a Poets Day on a Friday but most people understand that isn't possible. It's outrageous to cut the school day. Children need more teaching, not less.'</p>

<p>City councillor Louise Griffiths, who is also a governor at the school, blasted the plans, saying it was 'unacceptable' to cut children's education to save money.</p>

<p>She said: 'The main issue is citing cuts to funding.</p>

<p>'I got hold of the funding for the school from the Department for Education which actually shows there hasn't been any cuts - there's actually been an increase to funding.</p>

<p>'This is worrying that they are willing to cut children's education time to save money, despite the fact they have had an increase in funding.</p>

<p>'This is not acceptable.'</p>

<p>In addition to the 1.15pm finish on Fridays, parents will also be told to drop their children off at 8.45am - 15 minutes later than now.</p>

<p>Lunchtimes will be cut to 45 minutes for the school's 400 pupils, with concerns raised over rushing children's eating and socialising time.</p>

<p>Cllr Griffiths added: 'The thing that worries me is not only closing the school early, but they will also reduce lunchtimes.</p>

<p>'If you are expecting five, six, seven-year olds to hurry up and eat their lunch and then have socialisation within 45 minutes, it's just not going to happen.'</p>

<p>Dozens of furious parents have written to Worcestershire County Council to complain about the new measures.</p>

<p>County councillor Paul Denham said: 'Especially after the children have just lost six months of schooling because of Covid-19 lockdown it seems such an insensitive thing to do. The timing is so bad.</p>

<p>'When the school became an academy there was a lot of opposition and objection by parents.</p>

<p>'One of the reasons the school became an academy was because they would have more money to spend and be able to do a better job of educating the children.</p>

<p>'But now a couple of years later they're saying they can't afford to keep the school open for normal hours.</p>

<p>'It seems against the argument of them joining for extra money.'</p>

<p>Amarjit Cheema, CEO of Perry Hall Multi-Academy Trust, which the school is part of, says the extra time will be used by teaching staff to do their planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) </p>
