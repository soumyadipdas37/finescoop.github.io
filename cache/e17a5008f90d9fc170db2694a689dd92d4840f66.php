<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The world's most elaborate cat rescue came to an end  when a scaffold firm put up a four-story platform after an entire town  had been trying to rescue a kitten stuck up on a tree  for three days. </p>

<p>Residents in Tredegar, Wales spotted the cat, named Cookie, at the top of a tree on Saturday and tried to get the cat down with treats, cherry pickers and even a four-storey scaffold. </p>

<p>After RSPCA and the fire brigade were unsuccessful, a local scaffolding firm built a makeshift structure to try to get the cat back to the ground but it didn't seem to work.</p>

<p>AP Scaffolding put up a four-story platform to try and coax the kitten back to the ground</p>

<p>Workers from AP Scaffolding left food and water at the top but failed to convince the kitten to leave its hiding spot. </p>

<p>Eventually a tree surgeon managed to get the cat into a bag and bring it down. </p>

<p>Resident Leanne Skinner, who had been co-coordinating efforts to try to get the cat down and posting updates on Facebook, posted:'Well what a bonkers couple of days! </p>

<p>'There has been so many people that have come to help save Cookie the cat and I can't thank them enough.</p>

<p>Residents of Tredegar, Wales have been trying to rescue the cat for three days using treats and cherry pickers </p>

<p>AP Scaffolding also posted on their social media that Cookie who was stuck up on the tree for three days is now safe </p>

<p>'Without each and every attempt we wouldn't have got her down safely this evening.'  </p>

<p> AP Scaffolding also posted an update on their page: 'She's down! </p>

<p>'Thank goodness she's safe and can now be reunited with her owners.</p>

<p>'This truly was a community effort! From the cherry pickers, tree surgeon, the fire brigade, Gavin Townsend, Ryan Chislett, Brandon Gibbs, Jaydn Jackson and Pricey's Tree removal! </p>

<p>'Most importantly Leanne Skinner who never gave up, did everything she could and more to save the cat!</p>

<p>'We are extremely proud to have been part of this! Thank you all!'</p>

<p> Others on social media have hailed the scaffolders for their efforts.</p>

<p>One person said: 'Such a wonderful thing to do. Well done and fingers crossed for a happy ending.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Thank you so much for this huge act of kindness.'</p>

<p>A third posted: 'Real heroes. Thank you so much for what you are doing.'</p>
