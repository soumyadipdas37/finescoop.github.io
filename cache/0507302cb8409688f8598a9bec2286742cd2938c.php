<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Crown creator Peter Morgan has claimed the parallels between Princess Diana and Meghan Markle are 'obvious' and 'impossible' not to see.</p>

<p>The British screenwriter claims the upcoming fourth series of the royal Netflix drama, which introduces actress Emma Corrin as the young Lady Diana Spencer, 'shines a lot of lights on where we are now'.</p>

<p>Speaking in an interview with Vanity Fair, Morgan said he was careful not to dwell too much on recent royal headlines, such as Prince Andrew's involvement with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and the Sussexes' departure, while creating the latest episodes.</p>

<p>He stressed: 'If you draw too many intentional parallels, it actually becomes quite ugly.'</p>

<p>The Crown creator Peter Morgan has claimed the parallels between Princess Diana and Meghan Markle (pictured) are 'obvious' and 'impossible' not to see</p>

<p>'When you see a beautiful young princess struggling to find love and acceptance within the family, the parallels [between Meghan and Diana, pictured in 1987] are obvious and the parallels write themselves,' Morgan said</p>

<p>He did, however, concede that the parallels between Meghan Markle, 39, and Diana, who died in a car crash aged 36 in August 1997, 'write themselves'. </p>

<p>'When you see a beautiful young princess struggling to find love and acceptance within the family, the parallels are obvious and the parallels write themselves,' Morgan said.</p>

<p>'If you come into [the Royal Family] with any agenda for yourself - or if you come in and connect with the public in a way that threatens to change the way that the royal family connects with the public - that's something that doesn't particularly sit comfortably for either side. </p>

<p>'Really, the only version of events that works is if somebody comes in and becomes invisible, and just sort of knuckles down to a lifetime of agreeable supplicancy to the duties of the crown. </p>

<p>The British screenwriter claims the upcoming fourth series of the royal Netflix drama, which introduces actress Emma Corrin as the young Lady Diana Spencer (pictured), 'shines a lot of lights on where we are now'</p>

<p>'Diana struggled to fit in with the institution in a way that it's impossible not to see the parallels with Meghan Markle and Harry. So the story feels both incredibly vivid historically, but also it really shines a lot of lights on where we are now.'</p>

<p>The Crown Series Four will begin as the 1970s are drawing to a close, with the Royal Family preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles who is still unmarried at 30.</p>

<p>Morgan described Diana as 'an extraordinary char­acter', adding: 'She was very much the British Eva Perón – such a mythic figure, so much bigger than anything we'd been used to.'</p>

<p>In series four, which begins in 1977, viewers will be introduced to Diana, aged 16, before she became a member of the Firm, when she was living with flatmates in London.</p>

<p>The Crown Series Four will begin as the 1970s are drawing to a close, with the Royal Family preoccupied with safeguarding the line of succession by securing an appropriate bride for Prince Charles [played by Josh O'Connor, pictured with Olivia Colman as The Queen] who is still unmarried at 30</p>

<p>They'll then witness the brief courtship between Diana and Prince Charles - after he was unable to wed Camilla Parker Bowles - and the events leading up to the eventual dissolution of their marriage. </p>

<p>Corrin, 24, told how fans will see the People's Princess turn from a 'girl to a woman' before the series culminates in 1990 - when actress Elizabeth Debicki succeeds her in the role. </p>

<p>Morgan also revealed the new series, which premieres November 15, will portray Olivia Colman's Queen Elizabeth II and Gillian Anderson's Margaret Thatcher as 'twins who are not the same'.</p>

<p>He admitted learning the monarch and politician were born just six months apart was 'a breakthrough' for him when writing the fourth season.</p>

<p>The new series of The Crown will portray the Queen and Margaret Thatcher as 'twins who are not the same', it's creator Peter Morgan has revealed (pictured, Stephen Boxer playing Dennis Thatcher with Gillian Anderson's Margaret Thatcher in a scene from the Netflix show) </p>

<p>'They're both very resilient, very committed, work incredibly hard, have an extraordinary sense of duty,' Morgan said. 'They're both really committed to the country.'</p>

<p>There have long been claims about tensions between the Queen and Lady Thatcher during her time in Downing Street, fuelled by suspicions of class tensions.</p>

<p>A book released in 2015, In The Queen And Mrs Thatcher: An Inconvenient Relationship, chronicles how the two women 'met and disliked each other on sight'.</p>

<p>Mr Palmer, a TV producer, wrote: 'For over a decade they quietly waged a war against each other on both a personal and political stage, disagreeing on key issues including sanctions against South Africa, the miners' strike and allowing US planes to bomb Libya using British military bases.'</p>

<p>The Crown's creator has pointed to similarities between the two women, including their duty and strong Christian faith (pictured together in 1979) </p>

<p>However, in later life the two women are said to have formed a stronger bond.</p>

<p>When Lady Thatcher died in April 2013 at the age of 88, the Queen attended her funeral at St Paul's Cathedral. </p>

<p>It was recently announced The Crown will run for six series instead of five. Morgan revealed he decided to 'return to the original plan,' meaning Imelda will now appear for two series as an older Queen Elizabeth II.</p>

<p>Producers decided to a U-turn after their January announcement The Crown would end after its fifth series.</p>

<p>Morgansaid: 'As we started to discuss the storylines for Series 5, it soon became clear that in order to do justice to the richness and complexity of the story we should go back to the original plan and do six seasons.'</p>
