<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Even in this condensed summer between seasons, the impact of new signings are going to be the main talking points of the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the top-flight sides in England take to the field once again on September 12 - just seven weeks after the 2019-20 season came to a close. </p>

<p>Several Premier League sides have been busy in the transfer market, which closes on on October 5. Sportsmail takes a look at the new buys who are likely to light up the first weekend of the top-flight.  </p>

<p>Rodrigo - Leeds United</p>

<p>Position: Forward</p>

<p>Price: £27million</p>

<p>First match: Liverpool (A), September 12</p>

<p>Leeds' new record signing Rodrigo can help his new employers stun Liverpool on Saturday </p>

<p>Leeds United's tie away at Liverpool on Saturday will be a momentous day for the supporters as they will watch their team in the top-flight for the first time in 16 years.</p>

<p>It will also be memorable for the Whites fans as they will get to see their record signing for the first time in the Premier League. With Liverpool set to continue their high defensive line going into the new season, the 29-year-old striker is expected to be a threat on the break.</p>

<p>Nobody knows what to expect from Marcelo Bielsa's side this season, their opening game at Anfield will give us a strong indication whether Leeds are here to challenge the big boys or provoke modest expectations amongst their fans. </p>

<p>Eberechi Eze - Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Position: Attacking midfielder</p>

<p>Price: £17million</p>

<p>First match: Southampton (H), September 12  </p>

<p>Attacking talent Eberechi Eze could be key in Crystal Palace's first match versus Southampton</p>

<p>He may only be 22-years-old, but there is a lot of expectation on the shoulders of Eberechi Eze at Selhurst Park this season.</p>

<p>The former QPR man lit up the Championship with some impressive displays last season, which earned him a £17million to Roy Hodgson's side.</p>

<p>Palace will be hoping that Eze will be a regular on the Eagles' scoresheet whilst also helping to provide key passes to other attacking talents such as Wilfried Zaha and Jordan Ayew - starting in his first home match against Southampton on Saturday. </p>

<p>Timo Werner - Chelsea </p>

<p>Position: Striker</p>

<p>Price: £47.5million</p>

<p>First match: Brighton (A), September 14</p>

<p>Timo Werner (left) scored against Brighton in pre-season - he could do the same on Monday</p>

<p>It's all change at Chelsea as Frank Lampard has made a £200million overhaul of his squad to turn them into potential title challengers.</p>

<p>And after the inconsistencies of Olivier Giroud, Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi up front, the Blues finally have a striker they can rely on in the form of Germany international Timo Werner.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old scored 34 goals in 45 matches in all competitions for RB Leipzig last season and the pacy, clinical forward will be looking to get off to the perfect Premier League start against Brighton on Monday night. </p>

<p>Werner found the net just minutes into Chelsea's pre-season tie against Brighton in August and could do the same at the Amex on the opening weekend.  </p>

<p>Matheus Pereira - West Bromwich Albion</p>

<p>Position: Attacking midfielder</p>

<p>Price: £9million</p>

<p>First match: Leicester City (H), September 13</p>

<p>Matheus Pereira (right) made his loan move to West Bromwich Albion permanent this summer</p>

<p>West Bromwich Albion supporters all know about what Matheus Pereira can bring to the team, but Premier League fans have yet to seen him play. </p>

<p>The silky midfielder was a bright light in the Baggies side that won promotion to the top-flight last term through the automatic promotion spots. </p>

<p>In his loan spell at the Hawthorns last term, Pereira registered a whopping 20 assists in the second tier whilst also scoring eight league goals. If he carries on his form in the top-flight, it could boost Slaven Bilic and West Brom's promotion chances.  </p>

<p>Willian - Arsenal</p>

<p>Position: Winger/Attacking Midfielder</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>First match: Fulham (A), September 12 </p>

<p>New Arsenal man Willian heads back to west London for the Gunners' first match at Fulham </p>

<p>Brazilian winger Willian made the shock switch across London to Arsenal after turning down a lucrative new contract at Chelsea.</p>

<p>While the 32-year-old was regularly used as a winger at Stamford Bridge, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta has hinted that Willian could be used in a more attacking midfield role in north London. </p>

<p>The Brazilian will return to west London for his first Premier League match in the red and white of Arsenal against Fulham and will be looking to get off to a positive start.</p>

<p>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - Tottenham Hotspur</p>

<p>Position: Midfielder</p>

<p>Price: £25million</p>

<p>First match: Everton (H), September 13</p>

<p>Ex-Southampton skipper Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg could be Spurs' new key man in midfield</p>

<p>Spurs have been needing a reshuffle in midfield for some time and ex-Southampton captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is hoping to be the breath of fresh air Jose Mourinho needs in the middle of the park.</p>

<p>The Danish midfielder is expected to be the ball-winning option out of the midfield three in order to compliment the likes of Giovani Lo Celso and Dele Alli going forward. Hojbjerg can break up play while also play simple yet effective passes going ahead.</p>

<p>His opening match for Spurs against Everton will not be an easy contest, but he is expected to be a major factor as to whether Mourinho's men get off to a winning start.     </p>

<p>Thiago Silva - Chelsea</p>

<p>Position: Centre-back</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>First match: Brighton (A), September 14</p>

<p>Thiago Silva could make his Chelsea debut this weekend after his move from PSG this summer</p>

<p>While Chelsea will have new attacking starlets such as Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz in their squad, Brazilian centre-back Thiago Silva will play a vital role in the Blues' success this term. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old may be hitting the twilight of his career but he will provide the leadership and defensive astuteness that Lampard's side desperately lacked last season.</p>

<p>Fresh off the back of an impressive Champions League final performance, Silva's prospective debut against Brighton should not be too difficult a test. </p>

<p>Mohammed Salisu - Southampton</p>

<p>Position: Centre-back</p>

<p>Price: £11million</p>

<p>First match: Crystal Palace (A), September 12 </p>

<p>Southampton defender Mohammed Salisu (right) is set to be a tricky customer to play against</p>

<p>Young defender Mohammed Salisu had an impressive season at Real Valladolid last term, now he's getting a try at some top-flight action in England.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old is expected to be the reliable defensive option in Ralph Hasenhuttl's relentless attacking team and his displays will be crucial in determining his how far the Saints improve from last term. </p>

<p>Good with his feet and possessing frightening pace, Crystal Palace's forward will need to be on the top of their game if they want to get past Salisu on the opening day.  </p>

<p>Jeff Hendrick - Newcastle United</p>

<p>Position: Midfielder</p>

<p>Price: Free</p>

<p>First match:  West Ham (A), September 12 </p>

<p>Jeff Hendrick could make a positive first start for Newcastle against West Ham on Saturday</p>

<p>Irish midfielder Jeff Hendrick impressed at Burnley but can now project similar levels of performances at Steve Bruce's Newcastle United. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old is an excellent ball carrier and could be the all-important link which connects the Magpies' midfield to their forward line.</p>

<p>With Newcastle facing a West Ham side who are yet to make any transfers this summer, this is an opportunity for Hendrick and Newcastle to start the season on the front foot.  </p>
