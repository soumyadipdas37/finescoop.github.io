<p>Treat yourself: Lottie Moss treated herself to a pampering day at her favourite London salon on Tuesday, dressing in head to toe PrettyLittleThing</p>

<p>The blonde showed off her legs by teaming her statement shirt with black cycling shorts.</p>

<p>She added a simple white vest under the shirt and completed her look with pristine white sneakers and a PLT Face Mask for her entry into the salon. </p>

<p>Lottie spent 3 hours in Blush and Blow in Parsons Green, getting a full on beauty treatment at the plush blow dry and beauty bar on New Kings Road. </p>

<p>She emerged with flawlessly blow-dried locks, adding her face mask as she headed to her next stop of the day. </p>

<p>Cool: The model looked effortlessly cool in a pink checked oversized shirt for her outing</p>

<p>Lottie had been isolating in the Cotswolds with her family during the lockdown after being unable to fly home to LA but is now staying in London.  </p>

<p>It's been a rollercoaster time for the model, who shared a couple of pictures of herself crying after watching a 'lame' film last week, as she urged her followers to remember that 'everything isn't always perfect.' </p>

<p>Enjoying a little 'me-time', the evening seemed to be a pleasant one as she indulged in a relaxing face mask while at home, writing 'self-care' over the snap. </p>

<p>Then sobbing, she wrote': I shouldn't watch sad films.' </p>

<p>Safety first: She added a simple white vest under the shirt and completed her look with pristine white sneakers and a PLT Face Mask for her entry into the salon</p>

<p>She then cried harder and penned: 'It's OK to not be OK sometimes. It's OK to cry at lame films and it's OK to be a bit lost in life.</p>

<p>'Everyone's lives look so amazing on Instagram and I'm here to remind you that everything isn't always perfect.' </p>

<p>Media personality Chris split from his ex-girlfriend, Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson, in April. </p>

<p>It came after Lottie was linked to Roman Kemp amid claims she had been on a 'tipsy' date with I'm A Celebrity star and Capital FM host.</p>

<p>News of their alleged fling came just three weeks after the broadcaster split from his girlfriend of three years Anne-Sophie Flury.</p>
