<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sebastian Vettel has been confirmed as an Aston Martin driver for the 2021 season - just hours after Sergio Perez revealed he was leaving the team. </p>

<p>The four-time world champion suffered a poor season with Ferrari last year, with the manufacturer releasing the 33-year-old earlier this summer. </p>

<p>He had been in talks with Aston Martin, who will rebrand from Racing Point in 2021, for several weeks after becoming a free agent and is now set to team up with Lance Stroll, the son of Lawrence Stroll - a co-owner of the team. </p>

<p>Sebastian Vettel has been confirmed as an Aston Martin driver for the 2021 season </p>

<p>The German became surplus to requirements at Ferrari after a poor campaign last year  </p>

<p>'I am pleased to finally share this exciting news about my future,' Vettel said. </p>

<p>'I'm extremely proud to say that I will become an Aston Martin driver in 2021. It's a new adventure for me with a truly legendary car company. I have been impressed with the results the team has achieved this year and I believe the future looks even brighter.‍</p>

<p>'The energy and commitment of Lawrence [Stroll] to the sport is inspiring and I believe we can build something very special together.</p>

<p>'I still have so much love for Formula 1 and my only motivation is to race at the front of the grid. To do so with Aston Martin will be a huge privilege.'</p>

<p>Vettel is set to link up with Lance Stroll at his new team, set to rebrand as Aston Martin in 2021</p>

<p>It follows an annoucement from Mexican Perez that he would be leaving Racing Point after playing a key role in helping the team, previously known as Force India, from going out of business in 2018.</p>

<p>Perez said: 'Everything in life always has a beginning and an end, and after seven years together, my time with the team will come to an end after this season.</p>

<p>'It hurts a bit as I bet on the team during very rough times. We managed to overcome obstacles and I am very proud of saving the jobs of several of my team-mates.' </p>

<p>Perez revealed his departure ahead of this weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix after seven years</p>

<p>'I'll keep the memories of the great moments lived together, the friendships and the satisfaction of always giving my all. </p>

<p>'I will always be grateful for the opportunity given to me by [former owner] Vijay Mallya, who believed in me in 2014 and allowed me to continue my F1 career with Force India.</p>

<p>'To the current administration, led by Lawrence Stroll, I wish nothing but the best in the future, especially with the upcoming Aston Martin project.'</p>
