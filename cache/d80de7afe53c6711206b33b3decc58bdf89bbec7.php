<p>An incredible video shows almost 50 years of dirt being removed from an Australian 20 cent coin</p>

<p>The TikTok account features dozens of other videos, with coins from all over the globe receiving the same makeover.</p>

<p>The coins are released back into circulation after they're cleaned.  </p>

<p>The footage has proved extremely popular on the video-sharing app.</p>

<p>'This was so satisfying', one woman wrote. </p>

<p>'I'm shocked to find out 20 cent coins are silver,' another said.</p>

<p>Others suggested they had wasted their time cleaning it by hand. </p>

<p>'Next leave it in a can of coke overnight,' they said.</p>

<p> The cleaner only used a cotton tip and High Strength Metal Cleaning Polish to give the coin a new look (pictured)</p>
