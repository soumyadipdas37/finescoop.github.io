<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Romelu Lukaku has showed just how much the FIFA console games mean to him after embarking on a bizarre social media rant this week, following the release of his new personal rating.</p>

<p>FIFA 2021 will soon be hitting the shops and, in recent days, the creators have released the top 100 best rated players on the upcoming edition.</p>

<p>It has become an annual ritual where footballers check their ratings and compare against team-mates and opponents, while often making playful digs at one another online.</p>

<p>Romelu Lukaku clearly cares plenty about his FIFA rating after a bizarre outburst this week</p>

<p>Yet this year Lukaku has been sent into a rage, despite his player in the game being ranked among the best strikers.</p>

<p>The Inter Milan star is rated as an 85 overall in the coming edition, which represents a one figure drop from his 86 rating on the previous FIFA 20. It also places him behind the likes of Jamie Vardy and his Serie A rival Ciro Immobile.</p>

<p>Lukaku's 85 represents a drop from last year</p>

<p>After a stellar debut season in Serie A, in which he scored 23 goals in 36 Serie A matches and broke European records by scoring in 10 consecutive Europa League matches, Lukaku clearly feels aggrieved that his stock - albeit digitally - has not risen.</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter the furious 27-year-old wrote: 'Let’s be honest fifa just mess with the ratings so we players start complaining about the game and give them more publicity... i ain’t with this sh*t. I know what i do.' </p>

<p>His outburst received all manner of responses, with many fans arguing his rating was indeed a fair representation while pointing out that things such as his sprinting speed had increased on the game.</p>

<p>Others noted how Lukaku was coming across as 'insecure,' and should not be bothered by something as minor and inconsequential as a game rating.</p>

<p>Many players have this week given their verdicts on the FIFA game's latest assessment of them, with Liverpool starTrent Alexander-Arnold left delighted with his rating... but less than impressed with the perceived shooting ability.</p>

<p>One player who is certainly happy with his FIFA rating is Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold</p>

<p>The full-back was happy with his high rating of 87 which places him in the top 50 players</p>

<p>The Premier League winner, who plays his fair share of the virtual football game, was pleased overall but took aim at one of the statistics he was handed.</p>

<p>'Yeah I'm happy, of course! 87. Wow, thats high!', Alexander-Arnold told Dan Walker as he was shown his ratings card on Football Focus.  </p>

<p>The Liverpool man was given a relatively low rating of 66 for his shooting despite showcasing his impressive ability in front of goal with three stunning free kicks in the Reds' title-winning campaign.</p>

<p>'Maybe they put that in there because it's my squad number' '(I scored) Four goals (last season) from full-back', Alexander-Arnold joked. </p>
