<p>The unassuming South Australian couple were showing their design to their real estate agent, David Wood, who urged them to reconsider their layout.   </p>

<p>Dirty design: The Block's Daniel and Jade suffered an embarrassing gaffe on Wednesday, after they were told their kitchen island looked like a penis</p>

<p>After sitting down to design the kitchen's island bench, Jade said she wanted something that was 'going to draw their attention and their eye' to it.</p>

<p>Describing the curved end as 'an interesting piece to the island', the hairdresser seemed confident in her unique design.</p>

<p>But after showing their real estate agent the 'unusual' design, he seemed less enthusiastic about it.</p>

<p>'It looked like a penis at the end to me,' he said matter-of-fact after reviewing Daniel and Jade's plans.</p>

<p>After Daniel, 35, admitted that David was 'a little bit concerned', they decided to change their design at the last minute.</p>

<p>'Ah, a bench like that with stools around it, I've never seen it work well. And I'm sorry,' David told them diplomatically.</p>

<p>David then suggested they revert back to the architect's original layout for the kitchen.</p>

<p>Taking his feedback onboard, Daniel and Jade frantically called the company creating their kitchen and asked to change the design.</p>

<p>'We want to sell our house. We don't want it to sit here empty. We want it to sell on auction day. We want it gone,' said Jade. </p>
