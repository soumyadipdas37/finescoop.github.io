<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea have given Christian Pulisic the club's No 10 shirt after Willian moved to London rivals Arsenal, according to reports.</p>

<p>Pulisic enjoyed a strong debut campaign at Stamford Bridge after arriving from Borussia Dortmund, scoring 11 goals and producing 10 assists in 34 matches in all competitions last season.</p>

<p>And according to The Athletic, the American international has since been handed the No 10 jersey in west London - which has been worn by many famous names down the years.</p>

<p>Christian Pulisic has reportedly been given the No 10 shirt at Chelsea after a fine debut season</p>

<p>Pulisic has been handed the shirt number after Willian departed for London rivals Arsenal</p>

<p>Willian: 2019-20</p>

<p>Eden Hazard: 2013-14 - 2018-19</p>

<p>Juan Mata: 2011-12 - 2013-14</p>

<p>Yossi Benayoun: 2010-11</p>

<p>Joe Cole: 2003-04 - 2009-10</p>

<p>Willian joined Arsenal on a free transfer earlier on in the summer window, having spent seven years at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The Brazilian had inherited the No 10 shirt from Eden Hazard before the beginning of last season when the Belgian winger joined Real Madrid in a mega-money deal.</p>

<p>But after moving to north London, it's now Pulisic's time to don Chelsea's shirt number - which has also been worn by the likes of Joe Cole, Juan Mata and Mark Hughes.</p>

<p>After shining last season in his new environment following his move from Germany, many have viewed Pulisic as Hazard's successor at Stamford Bridge under Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>Pulisic tormented defences at times last season and will be hoping to continue in the same fashion when Chelsea start their 2020-21 campaign.</p>

<p>The Blues, who secured a Champions League spot after finishing fourth last term, take on Brighton away in their opening match of the Premier League season on Monday night.</p>

<p>And the Athletic also report that Pulisic is in line to feature at the Amex StadiumÂ after recovering from a hamstring injury suffered in the FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal.</p>
