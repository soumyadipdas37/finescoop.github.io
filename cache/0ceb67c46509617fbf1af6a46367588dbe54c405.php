<p>Cardinal Angelo Becciu's resignation was accepted by Pope Francis in a statement issued by the Vatican late on Thursday.  </p>

<p>High-ranking Vatican official Cardinal Angelo Becciu (pictured) has resigned from his post and renounced his rights amid a financial scandal that has reportedly implicated him indirectly </p>

<p>Mr Becciu, the former deputy in the Vatican's secretariat of state, has been reportedly implicated in the scandal involving the €200m (£180m) purchase of a London property with Church funds through offshore funds and companies.</p>

<p>The money was used to buy an apartment block in Sloane Avenue during the cardinal's time as Substitute for General Affairs.</p>

<p>The deal is thought to have lost the Holy See millions of pounds in fees paid to middlemen.  </p>

<p>The Vatican prosecutor has placed several Vatican officials under investigation, as well as the middlemen, but not Mr Becciu.</p>

<p>In June, Italian businessman Gianluigi Torzi was arrested by Vatican police on suspicion of extortion and embezzlement. </p>

<p>Cardinal Angelo Becciu's resignation was accepted by Pope Francis (pictured earlier today) in a statement issued by the Vatican late on Thursday</p>

<p>Mr Becciu, 72, has defended the soundness of the original investment and denied any wrongdoing. </p>

<p>He told Italian website Domani he was being forced out because he was suspected of giving Church money to his brothers.</p>

<p>'I didn't steal even one euro. I am not under investigation but if they send me to trial, I will defend myself,' he was quoted as saying. </p>

<p>'I said to the Pope: why are you doing this to me, in front of the whole world?' </p>
