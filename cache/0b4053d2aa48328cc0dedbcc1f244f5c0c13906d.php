<p>Hot stuff: Alessandra Ambrosio was wowing in clothes on Wednesday evening as she headed for dinner in a sizzling ensemble in West Hollywood</p>

<p>Alessandra looked incredible in the sexy wrap top which made the most of both her abs and her perky cleavage as she strutted down the Hollywood streets. </p>

<p>As she displayed her frame, it is easy to wonder how she stays in shape - the secrets of which she revealed in a interview about her workouts with Tracy Anderson. </p>

<p>Speaking about how she prepares for the annual Victoria's Secret fashion show, she said: 'I train the whole year, and right before [the Victoria's Secret show] I start to train a bit more than the rest of the year....  </p>

<p>'I love to workout, and I love to do Tracy Anderson. I get very focused on being fit and feeling good for the runway. </p>

<p>Wow! The Brazilian beauty, 39, looked sensational in a wrap top and high-waisted trousers, in which she was showcasing her braless state by preening and posing</p>

<p>'I try to go three times a week to Tracy Anderson, then I will for a hike one day of the week or do yoga. Sometimes I feel like I need to do more yoga, and other times I feel I need more toning, which is what Tracy is all about...</p>

<p>'It really depends how I feel and the strength I have at the time.'</p>

<p>Alessandra rose to international fame as a Victoria's Secret Angel, announcing that she was giving up the title at the end of 2017.</p>

<p>Strutting her stuff: Alessandra looked incredible in the sexy wrap top which made the most of both her abs and her perky cleavage as she strutted down the Hollywood streets</p>

<p>She has since collaborated with her sister Aline and a pal called Gisele Coria to launch her swimwear line Gal Floripa, which debuted last March.</p>

<p>The brand takes its title from a nickname for Florianopolis, the Brazilian city where Alessandra gave birth to both of her children.</p>

<p>Alessandra shares her 12-year-old daughter Anja and her eight-year-old son Noah with her ex-fiance, RE/DONE founder Jamie Mazur. The couple split in March 2018 after a 10 year engagement, and amicably co-parent their children. </p>

<p>In July that year, Alessandra revealed she was dating Italian businessman Nicolo Oddi and spent the last few months in lockdown isolating with her boyfriend and her children.</p>
