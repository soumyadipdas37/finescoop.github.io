<p>The treatment is used to eradicate cancer cells and to try to ensure tumours do not return. But research in The Lancet found there was no benefit.</p>

<p>Academics at University College London said radiotherapy performed later, at the first sign of cancer coming back, had equally good outcomes. It means many of the roughly 15,000 men a year who have the treatment could avoid it – and side-effects such as impotence and incontinence.</p>

<p>Thousands of men could be spared the ordeal of having radiotherapy after surgery for prostate cancer, scientists said last night</p>

<p>Dr Claire Vale, who led the review, said: 'Our findings suggest that following surgery, patients whose cancer is confined to the prostate, or has spread only to nearby tissues or organs, can safely be spared routine post-operative radiotherapy and its associated side-effects. Radiotherapy need only be given to men if they show early signs that the cancer may be returning.</p>

<p>'Guidelines and policy regarding the standard of care for prostate cancer should be updated based on the findings.'</p>

<p>The team combined data from patients in the UK, France, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Denmark and Ireland, to investigate the optimal timing of radiotherapy.</p>

<p>The results included 2,153 men enrolled across three trials – 1,075 had radiotherapy straight after surgery, and another 1,078 had 'early salvage' radiotherapy, where treatment is delayed until signs of the disease come back.</p>

<p>The authors found little difference between early salvage – with a five-year survival rate of 88 per cent – and immediate radiotherapy, with an 89 per cent rate.</p>

<p>The Daily Mail is campaigning for greater prostate cancer awareness, treatment and diagnosis, which, although improving, is lagging years behind other diseases.</p>
