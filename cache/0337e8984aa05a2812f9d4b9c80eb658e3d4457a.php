<p>'Hoey' was repeated several times, as was a triple E with an inverted N and symbols relating to the 14th and 99th Regiment of Foot, British divisions stationed in Hobart from the 1840s to the '70s.</p>

<p>Graffiti engraved by soldiers on a military prison wall in Hobart more than 150 years ago has been discovered by accident during renovations</p>

<p>Defence Tasmania sustainability manager Kate Hibbert said there was also a little picture of a hat badge relating to the 99th regiment.</p>

<p>'The wall they're scratched into was a military prison exercise wall,' she said.</p>

<p>'It would have been soldiers who were in the prison for punishment for some indiscretion.'</p>

<p>Dr Hibbert said a wagon shed built in the early 1900s had helped protect the wall.</p>

<p>'If it was out and exposed to the elements it probably would have eroded away by now,' she said.</p>

<p>Similar graffiti has previously been found on the doors of the building, which was built in 1847 and used as a prison for disobedient British soldiers until the late 1870s.</p>

<p>Dr Hibbert said clear perspex would be build over the engravings so they could be viewed by the public and studied further by historians.</p>

<p>'When I saw the '99' and the 14th regiment I was pretty surprised because that was 170 years ago,' she said.</p>

<p>'It was really exciting to see something that hasn't been noticed for that long.'</p>
