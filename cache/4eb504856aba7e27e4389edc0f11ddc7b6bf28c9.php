<p>A female pastor at a New York City church has filed a lawsuit against a male pastor accusing him of texting her photos of his penis, asking for sexual favors and calling her a 'stupid b***h' under his breath during services. </p>

<p>Rev. Grace Nzameyo Maa claims Rev. Charles Atkins Jr. tried to initiate an affair with her after helping her get a job at The French Evangelical Church of New York in 2018, according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Nzameyo, who is suing Atkins and the church, claims Atkins made several inappropriate comments to her after she started, including asking her to be his mistress because his 'wife isn't giving it to me anymore'.</p>

<p>'Grace, you're giving me a headache. I don't know why you don't understand. I love you and I want to build up this friendship and relationship. I gave you this ordination I want you to be with me as my mistress. My wife isn't giving it to me anymore,' he said, according to the lawsuit. </p>

<p>He is also alleged to have said: 'Grace, you know I love you and want you to be my girlfriend. You have to stop this madness. I'd like to get a blowjob from a cute pastor like you. I know you Africans don't like to give blowjobs.' </p>

<p>On another occasion, Atkins allegedly told her: 'Don’t wear your robe; I was hoping I could see your butt and curves and legs today.'  </p>

<p>Despite Nzameyo repeatedly asking him to stop, the lawsuit claims Atkins then sent her three different photos of his genitals.</p>

<p>Nzameyo, who is suing Atkins and the church, claims Atkins made several inappropriate comments to her after she started, including asking her to be his mistress because his 'wife isn't giving it to me anymore'</p>

<p>She claims that Atkins started retaliating against her after she refused his advances. </p>

<p>The lawsuit says Atkins would refuse to put Nzameyo’s on the Sunday bulletin and stopped her from participating in the Sunday service.</p>

<p>Nzameyo also claims that Atkins would call her a 'stupid b***h' under his breath when he was on the pulpit during the Sunday services, according to the lawsuit. </p>

<p>She filed a formal complaint against him in February 2019 with the New York Presbytery, which oversees the Manhattan church.</p>

<p>The lawsuit says Atkins submitted a letter in May 2019 renouncing jurisdiction of the of the Presbytery and the Presbyterian Church.</p>

<p>Nzameyo claims that even after Atkins left, she was stopped from holding services and carrying out her duties. </p>

<p>The New York’s Presbytery said in a statement that they couldn't investigate further given Atkins renounced jurisdiction of the church.</p>

<p>They also denied retaliating against Nzameyo.  </p>

<p>'This means that he ceased to be a minister of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and that the church could no longer investigate or try him in its courts. It is now solely in the secular court system,' the statement said. </p>

<p>'The Presbytery did not retaliate against his accuser; her employment as a minister had not been not been undertaken properly.'</p>
