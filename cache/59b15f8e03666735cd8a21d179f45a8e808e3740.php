<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kurt Zouma is being courted by both Everton and Leicester this summer and Chelsea are prepared to cash in on the centre back before the window closes, say reports.</p>

<p>Zouma started alongside Andreas Christensen in the opening two Premier League matches of the season, but the arrival of Thiago Silva from Paris Saint-Germain is expected to drop him out of the starting XI.</p>

<p>With that in mind, Le10 Sport report that Chelsea are willing to cash in on the Frenchman if the right offer comes in, with Leicester and Everton eyeing moves.</p>

<p>Kurt Zouma is wanted by both Everton and Leicester this summer, according to reports</p>

<p>Zouma scored against Brighton but has slipped down the pecking order under Frank Lampard</p>

<p>It is believed that Everton are the more interested party, with Zouma having spent a successful loan spell at the club in the 2018-19 season.</p>

<p>Zouma wasn't even in Chelsea's matchday squad for the game against West Brom at the weekend, leading to plenty of speculation surrounding his future.</p>

<p>It has been written that Chelsea would demand a fee in the region of £36million for Zouma should he leave in the summer transfer window.</p>

<p>The arrival of Thaigo Silva means Zouma's game-time this season might be limited at Chelsea</p>

<p>Zouma (right) spent time on loan at Everton during the 2018-19 Premier League season</p>

<p>His current contract runs through until June 2023, leaving Chelsea in a strong negotiating position should they decide to sell the defender.</p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger is another centre back that Chelsea are preparing to offload, with Frank Lampard trying to trim his squad before the October deadline. </p>

<p>Tottenham are the latest shock club to be linked with the Germany international, who has fallen way down the pecking order under Lampard.   </p>
