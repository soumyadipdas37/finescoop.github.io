<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The spat between the founder of Amigo Loans and its current board escalated over the weekend after a blog was posted by James Benamor on 21 August slating the company's practices and branding former CEO Hamish Paton's tenure a 'calamitous time'.</p>

<p>Benamor listed a number of proposals which included him being instated as CEO of the company's parent group - Amigo Holdings PLC.  </p>

<p>But today the board of struggling subprime lender Amigo Loans rejected the proposals outlined by Benamor and warned that his return to the business would be 'materially detrimental'.</p>

<p>On Friday, Benamore penned a blog welcoming the return of the CEO Glen Crawford but pointed out that he his work cut out for him - which included, he believed, the ousting of the remaining board members who he claims mismanaged Amigo.</p>

<p>The Amigo Loans board is currently locked in a bitter dispute with its founder James Benamor who is accusing the guarantor lender of irresponsible lending. Benamor wants to return as the parent company's CEO </p>

<p>He also recommended the cutting back on 'unnecessary suits' accused Amigo Loans of irresponsible lending - adding that it had 'financially excluded millions of ordinary people'.</p>

<p>Amigo hit back with an RNS announcement today pointing out that Benamore's blog was not issued through a regulated information service, highlighting that Crawford has made it clear that he is not prepared to continue to work at Amigo 'in any circumstances where Mr Benamor returns…'.</p>

<p>James Benamor, founder of Amigo Loans, pulled no punches in his scathing online attack on the companies current board. </p>

<p>On Friday Benamor wrote a blog with the following recommendations:</p>

<p>The board additionally called on its founder not to push ahead with a series of proposals he made on Friday.</p>

<p>It said that James Benamor should not 'waste further time and expense' in calling a shareholder vote which could seriously shake up the way the company is run.</p>

<p>The Amigo board warned that Crawford, who joined the guarantor lender as chief executive this year in March, can leave the business if Benamor calls and wins the shareholder vote.</p>

<p>Benamor suggested in his blog that the board should appoint him chief executive of Amigo Holdings, while putting Crawford back in charge of its subsidiary, Amigo Loans.</p>

<p>In June, the founder said that he would sell his 61 per cent stake in the lender after losing a fight to remove several of its directors.</p>

<p>Only around one vote out of 10 among independent shareholders was cast in favour of Benamor and his company Richmond Group.</p>

<p>The board highlighted in its statement: 'Mr Crawford's decision to return as CEO was predicated on the clear statement from Mr Benamor that he was selling down Richmond Group Limited's controlling shareholding in Amigo to a position of zero.'</p>

<p>The boards statement ended with it relaying its 'unanimous rejection' of the views and proposals put forward by Benamor.</p>

<p>The online slinging match follows the announcement last week that Amigo Loans got another extension from its lenders until December on a £250million finance deal.</p>

<p>It's not the first time that Amigo had been given an extension. The lifeline extends the deadline, which was meant to run out last Friday after originally being extended for a few weeks.</p>

<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service has recorded a steady increase in complaints about Amigo – 94 per cent of which were upheld in the second half of 2019.</p>

<p>The company said it would provide an update on its handling of complaints when it announces its results at the end of August.</p>

<p>Last year, 317 new complaints were recorded between July and December 2019 - a 349 per cent increase from the 69 complaints recorded in the second half of 2016.</p>
