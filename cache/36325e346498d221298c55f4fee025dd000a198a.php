<p>Where is Kassandra? Officials in Washington state are frantically looking for Kassandra Cantrell, 33, who has been missing for a week. She is three months pregnant </p>

<p>SWAT officers on Monday night served a search warrant at the Tacoma home (pictured) of Cantrell's ex-boyfriend</p>

<p>As of Tuesday morning, no arrests have been announced.</p>

<p>According to Cantrell's family, the 33-year-old is three months pregnant with her first child.</p>

<p>She was scheduled to have her first ultrasound appointment last Wednesday, but she never made it to the doctor's office, prompting her family to report her missing.</p>

<p>Cantrell's mother, Marie Smith, recalled the last time she spoke with her daughter on the phone.</p>

<p>'She said, "love you." I said, "I love you too,"' the woman recalled. </p>

<p>On Friday, officers found Cantrell's Mazda sedan abandoned near the Tacoma Dome</p>

<p>Cantrell's mother, Marie Smith (left), broke down in tears talking about her daughter's disappearance  </p>

<p>Smith said her daughter was excited about her unexpected pregnancy and has already picked out names for a boy and a girl, in the event she was having twins like her mother had. </p>

<p>Cantrell was last seen at 8.30am last Tuesday driving away from her home in Parkland, possibly en route to a grocery store. but investigators said her financial accounts have been dormant.</p>

<p>Her phone last pinged at around 1pm that day in the vicinity of Point Defiance Park before being turned off, or losing charge.  </p>

<p>Three days after Cantrell's last sighting, her 2014 white Mazda 3 sedan was found underneath the overpass to Highway 705 near the Tacoma Dome, about 10 miles from her home.</p>

<p>Cantrell was scheduled to have her first ultrasound on August 26 but never made it. Her phone last pinged at 1pm on August 25; her financial accounts have been dormant for a week</p>

<p>'It doesn't make any sense where the car was found. There's nothing in that area that she would have been going to,' said Smith.</p>

<p>Friends and family spent the better part of Sunday searching for Cantrell in Point Defiance Park, but their efforts failed to turn up any clues.  </p>

<p>Her family say Cantrell would not have left without telling anyone, especially without her two dogs </p>

<p>Her mother said Cantrell would not have just taken off without telling anyone, especially without her two beloved chihuahuas.</p>

<p>'What I hope, worst-case scenario, is that maybe she was carjacked and she’s just hurt somewhere.' Smith said.</p>

<p>But the mother expressed concern that the father of her daughter's unborn baby might be involved. </p>

<p>'I wouldn’t have suspected him if he wasn’t the father,' said Smith. 'But he has a girlfriend so I don’t know what that might, you know, what that might have triggered.'</p>

<p>Smith appealed directly to anyone who may be holding her daughter against her will, pleading with them to let her go. She also begged witnesses who may have seen Cantrell to come forward.    </p>

<p>Cantrell is described as being 5 feet, 7 inches tall, and weighing 180lbss with brown hair. </p>

<p>The search continues for a pregnant Parkland woman missing now for a week. We've learned that Pierce County sheriff's deputies served a search warrant overnight on Kassanndra Cantrell's ex-boyfriend’s home in Tacoma.</p>
