<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donny van de Beek bemoaned Manchester United's ponderous play after falling to a 'really bad' home defeat to Crystal Palace on his debut.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old midfielder arrived from Ajax for a fee rising to Â£40million at the start of the month and made an immediate impression by coming off the bench to score on his first appearance.</p>

<p>But Van de Beek will not look back on his debut fondly as Palace deservedly won 3-1 at Old Trafford, where Andros Townsend's early goal was complemented by a second-half Wilfried Zaha brace.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek lamented Manchester United's 'really bad' defeat to Crystal Palace</p>

<p>The 23-year-old midfielder came off the bench and scored in United's 3-1 home defeat</p>

<p>The performance highlighted the need for improvements, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer calling for introspection after his players fell 'short' of expectations on Saturday evening.</p>

<p>'My first match for the club and then you want to win,' Van de Beek said. 'It doesn't matter how you want to win.</p>

<p>'I'm really disappointed that we lose 3-1 at home. I think it's really bad.</p>

<p>'Yeah (we did not have as much match sharpness as Palace) but last week in training we did really well.</p>

<p>Andros Townsend's early goal was complemented by a second-half Wilfried Zaha brace</p>

<p>'We trained good, so my feeling was really positive. But, yeah, today we played too slowly.</p>

<p>'We went too long with the ball and I think against an opponent like Crystal Palace you need to speed up the game to create something. That was not good enough.'</p>

<p>Not only was Van de Beek candid in his assessment but the Holland international clearly took no consolation in netting on his debut.</p>

<p>'To play for all the fans in stadiums like this it's more nice to score,' he said.</p>

<p>'But still I scored but we lose and this is the most important thing, that we win.</p>

<p>'We lose but it's always really nice to play for a club like this.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer called for introspection after his players fell 'short' of expectations</p>

<p>'I made my first game and I hope to help the team and next time that we win, for sure.'</p>

<p>United have precious little time to recover as a trip to Championship outfit Luton awaits in the Carabao Cup third round on Tuesday before next weekend's Premier League match at Brighton.</p>

<p>'I mean, next week we need to step up and we need to win,' Van de Beek told MUTV. 'Also for our feeling, we need to step up now.'</p>

<p>Palace bowed out of the Carabao Cup on penalties at Bournemouth during the week, but Roy Hodgson's men will not mind having started a top-flight season with back-to-back wins for the first time in the club's history.</p>

<p>Holland international van de Beek clearly took no consolation in netting on his debut</p>

<p>Former United player Zaha was the star at Old Trafford, netting twice as he skippered his boyhood club in a competitive match for the first time.</p>

<p>'Being captain for the side today, especially at Old Trafford, I'm buzzing we managed to get the three points,' the 29-year-old said.</p>

<p>'I feel like we've got so much quality in the team, we just need to put it on the pitch.</p>

<p>'Before the game, I was telling the team: 'Believe in yourselves - don't be scared to play your game.'</p>

<p>Zaha meanwhile said he was 'buzzing' as he captained Palace for the first time competitively</p>

<p>'Obviously today we showed it and I'm not surprised by the two games we managed to win.'</p>

<p>Zaha, who continues to be linked with a summer exit, added: 'Obviously we know what they can do but we wanted to impose ourselves on the game.</p>

<p>'We've got so much pace and attacking threat in the team. We just wanted to utilise it from the beginning.'</p>
