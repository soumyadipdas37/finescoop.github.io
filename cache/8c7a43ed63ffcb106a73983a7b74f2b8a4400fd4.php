<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who was forced to cancel her trip to Europe because of coronavirus has taken home $1million in lottery winnings. </p>

<p>The lucky winner, from Morphett Vale in Adelaide's south, scored the division one prize in Monday's Lotto X draw.</p>

<p>The winning numbers in draw 4010 were 22, 35, 18, 1, 4 and 8, and the supplementary numbers were 14 and 38.</p>

<p>She told The Lott that she only bought the Lotto X ticket from Campbell's Newsagency at Southgate Plaza because she wasn't holidaying.</p>

<p>'We'd booked a trip to Europe, and we were supposed to be there now,' she said. </p>

<p>'It's strange to think that if we had been in Europe, I wouldn't have purchased this ticket and won $1million.'</p>

<p>When the woman and her husband do finally get to Europe, they will fly business class. </p>

<p>She also revealed the winnings will be spent fixing things around the home she shares with her husband.</p>

<p>The woman held one of the two winning division one tickets, with the second lucky South Australian from Salisbury, north of Adelaide, yet to come forward (stock image)</p>

<p>'I'm still working, but I might look to retire soon. You never really know what's ahead. It will be handy to have this as a nest egg.'</p>

<p>The woman held one of the two winning division one tickets, with the second lucky South Australian from Salisbury, north of Adelaide, yet to come forward.</p>

<p>The ticket is unregistered, which means officials from The Lott have no way of contacting the winner and have to wait for them to come forward to claim their prize. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman from The Lott urged Monday X Lotto players to check their tickets.</p>

<p>'You may have woken up a newly-minted millionaire and gone about your day completely oblivious.'  </p>
