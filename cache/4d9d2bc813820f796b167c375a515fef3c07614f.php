<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If asked for his most outlandish story,  Kimi Raikkonen would be forgiven for asking for time to think.</p>

<p>There was the time he missed the post-race presentation by Brazilian legend Pele because he 'was taking a s***'. </p>

<p>There was the time he escaped from the troops' accommodation while serving military service in Finland and ended up 'lying on the beach drinking beer'. </p>

<p>There was the time he took part in a poker boat race in Finland in 2007 dressed in a monkey suit, to the amusement of his fellow competitors.</p>

<p>Omg that little ���� at the end ���� #Kimi7 hits �� pic.twitter.com/JP3xSUgXUB</p>

<p>Or, perhaps best of all, there was the time he went on a 16-day drinking binge in 2012 between the Bahrain Grand Prix and the Spanish Grand Prix. </p>

<p>That episode, perhaps the most outlandish of his career to date, started with a party hosted by the Prince of Bahrain and from then on chaos ensued. </p>

<p>In the days that followed Raikkonen, nicknamed in F1 as 'The Iceman', ended up in a swimming pool fully clothed, twisting his ankle trying to imitate Diego Maradona, missing a Lotus test due to his botched ankle and getting around the house on a bellboy-style baggage trolley.</p>

<p>Top it all off with a trip to Finland for drunken karaoke to mark Mother's Day and Raikkonen had produced one of the most maverick binges of any driver in F1 history. Remarkably, by the time it was lights out in Spain he stepped up.  He finished third.  </p>

<p>And so, yes, if Raikkonen needs a bit of time to work out his craziest tale, he has the stories to back it up.  </p>

<p>Raikkonen has dialled it back in recent years. The Finn is 40 now, has two children, Robin and Rianna,  a wife, Minttu, people who rely on him not to go on a booze-binge. </p>

<p>But, as an elder statesman of the grid these days, he occasionally makes no secret of his longing for the sport's more daring days off the track to return.</p>

<p>Thursday was one of those days as he cheekily hit out at world champion Lewis Hamilton via a hilarious meme comparing him to drivers of yesteryear.</p>

<p>Posted on his Instagram story, Raikkonen showed a side-by-side montage of a shirtless James Hunt, who won the 1976 championship, smoking and drinking. </p>

<p>Alongside Hunt was a picture of Hamilton, dressed head to toe in a very questionable matching outfit, in a bid to underline the drastic change between drivers past and present.</p>

<p>There are few emerging in the sport right now that are producing stories anywhere close to rivalling Raikkonen for sheer drama and entertainment. </p>

<p>Raikkonen couldn't help himself, even dragging in his own status as a rock 'n' roll symbol to the table. </p>

<p>A second post showed a photo of himself looking worse for wear and he accompanied it with the caption, 'Not all hope is lost yet!' </p>

<p>Raikkonen has always been good for a quote ever since he got behind the wheel. Racing he loves, interviews he does not. </p>

<p>But his dead-pan humour and wild lifestyle off the track made him into a cult hero for F1 fans. There were, and are, quite simply few left with his off-track DNA.</p>

<p>British driver David Coulthard was team-mates with Raikkonen when they shared the McLaren garage between 2002 and 2004 and to this day Coulthard has one memory of them that sticks out above all else.   </p>

<p>'I was team-mates with him for a couple of years and the only thing that p****d him off was when he did a stage dive at Ron Dennis' and I chose to catch Kathy Ojjeh, [McLaren part-owner] Mansour Ojjeh's wife, who was also doing one,' Coulthard told the Express.</p>

<p>'So when Kimi hit the deck, he pretended to be knocked out. When he jumped up he said "you're not a team-mate, you're an a******e".</p>

<p>Raikkonen won one championship in his career, lifting the drivers' title with Ferrari in 2007</p>

<p>He enjoyed alcohol away from the track and revealed he once had a 16-day drinking binge</p>

<p>'I said "I'm sorry but I'm going to catch the lady every time".'</p>

<p>If Coulthard felt the wrath of Raikkonen then the NASCAR engineers that were charged with looking after him for his first race in 2011 sure felt the brunt of it.</p>

<p>Not one to keep his thoughts to himself, even on his debut, he was quick to declare: 'We're so f*<strong>ing s</strong>t, it's unbelievable.' </p>

<p>This was after, 'I don't understand how this car can be so hot. My ass is even burning in here!' and 'Why you shouting on the f***ing radio?'</p>

<p>Quite simply, Raikkonen never really managed to grasp PG. It was, more often than not, an X-rated showcase in those early years. Modern day athletes like Hamilton treat their bodies like a temple. </p>

<p>Many won't eat meat, many won't smoke, and some even go teetotal and abstain from alcohol. But not Raikkonen, he had no interest in following any of that.</p>

<p>'I smoked for a couple of years when I was a kid,'  he explained in his book "The Unknown Kimi Raikkonen".  'But I haven't smoked habitually during my career. Except I've gone through quite a few fags when p<strong><em>ed, and I've been p</em></strong>ed pretty often.' </p>

<p>Raikkonen took the 2007 drivers' world championship title but the criticism levelled against him for years now has been that he could have added many more if he had disciplined himself off the track. </p>

<p>His antics have slowed down but not stopped for good as he turned up at Alfa Romeo's 2019 end of season party in a monkey costume, before entertaining the rest of the guests</p>

<p>But Raikkonen views it through a totally different prism, one whereby partying relaxes him, allows him to relieve stress and tension. Going with the mainstream was never part of the plan anyway.</p>

<p>'Obviously it's been a joke often,' he explained to F1's official Beyond the Grid podcast last year.</p>

<p>'But I actually think it's more true than a joke that I've often been driving better [after] doing whatever I want between the races than if I'm just not having fun and drinks and stuff.</p>

<p>'There's too many proven theories… that it might work better after you've had a bit more fun. That whole summer was more or less racing and partying. It's nothing new – for me it's normal. Outside it might look a bit weird, but for me, in the past, it was a very normal story.</p>

<p>'I always thought that [it makes you] more relaxed and you need to put more effort and concentration in [on track] because you're a bit unsure. And then the end result comes better.' </p>

<p>Idolising the lifestyle of maverick driver James Hunt comes as no surprise but unfortunately for Raikkonen, they just don't make them like that anymore.  </p>

<p>Alongside wife Minttu, Raikkonen has slowed down from his once rock 'n' roll lifestyle</p>

<p>The 40-year-old poked fun at Hamilton but, truth be told, rock'n'roll is a dying breed in F1</p>
