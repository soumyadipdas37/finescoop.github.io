<p>The designer, 46, has released a new Spring/Summer collection which includes the likes of a button-less, wide-lapelled blazer, flared trousers and denim.</p>

<p>'The aim is to blend reality with something to dream about,' she said, speaking to The Telegraph. 'I'm calling this petrol pump chic.'</p>

<p>The designer went on to say how she has particularly focused on smart knitwear, tailoring and dresses. </p>

<p>'There were definitely challenges designing this, because the Italian factories were closed for some of that time,' she explained. 'But I don't think I've ever been so excited to go to work. </p>

<p>'I had to be very strategic, because with a smaller business, every fabric we ordered, every sample we made, had to be really thought through. I really had to consider what my customers want to wear now'.</p>

<p>In keeping with safety guidelines amid the coronavirus pandemic, the former Spice Girl has ditched the London Fashion Week catwalk and instead debuted her new collection using four models at the Victoria Miro art gallery in East London.</p>

<p>The audience, which would have previously been filled with over 600 guests including the likes of celebrities and fashionistas, was instead traded in for consecutive groups of four fashion editors at one time. </p>

<p>The launch of the new collection comes after it was revealed the designer is set to axe 20 staff at her loss-making fashion label to 'future-proof' it after the coronavirus pandemic - just months after reversing plans to furlough employees.</p>

<p>Victoria's company, with its flagship Mayfair store which sells £2,000 dresses and £1,000 handbags, will also halve the number of annual fashion collections after being hard-hit by the Covid-19 crisis.</p>

<p>The blow for the staff come just two months after she came under fire for deciding to furlough 30 members of staff.   </p>

<p>A source told The Sun the new redundancies were a bid to save the label.</p>

<p>They said: 'Victoria is devastated. These are really tough times and no one is exempt from the pandemic's clutches.</p>

<p>'This business is her pride and joy. It has never been about money. She hasn't even paid herself for the past three years. She is doing all she can simply to keep as many people in work as possible.'</p>

<p>Victoria and her ex-footballer husband David, 45, are estimated to be worth £355million. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Victoria said: 'We have built a new strategic vision to streamline and future-proof the brand and, sadly, have to make redundancies to deliver this.' </p>

<p>The fashion line, which she launched in 2008, made losses of £12.3million in 2018. </p>

<p>In June it was reported that the designer was loaned a £6.4 million lifeline to save the fashion empire.</p>
