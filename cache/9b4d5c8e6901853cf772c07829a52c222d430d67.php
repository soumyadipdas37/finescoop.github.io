<p>Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air.</p>

<p>A source said: 'In these strange times, producers want the 2020 series to be as close to normal as possible and they feel that it wouldn’t be the same without a Hollywood handshake. </p>

<p>The first time that fans witnessed Paul's congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. </p>

<p>The program was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.   </p>
