<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sharks were thought to have evolved with a cartilage-based skeleton before other types of fish formed a boney structure, but a new discovery turns that on its head. </p>

<p>An ancient 'armoured fish' skull found in Mongolio has changed the way scientists think about shark skeletons - suggesting they may have evolved from bony fish.  </p>

<p>The discovery of the 410-million-year-old fish fossil suggests the lighter skeletons of sharks may have evolved from bony ancestors, rather than the other way around. </p>

<p>Experts from Imperial College London have been studying the remains of the foot long creature that is an ancient cousin of the whale shark and great white.</p>

<p>Named Minjinia turgenensis, the bizarre creature was a member of the placoderm family and had bony plates over its head and shoulders that acted as shields. </p>

<p>Minjinia's fossilised skull - dug up in the foothills of spectacular snow capped mountains of Mongolia - changes our understanding of shark evolution.</p>

<p>The newly discovered Minjinia is a placoderm, a type of armoured fish dating back over 300 million years.</p>

<p>Their head and thorax were covered by armoured plates with the rest of their body scaled or naked depending on the species.</p>

<p>They were among the first jawed fish - with jaws evolving from gill arches.</p>

<p>Minjinia was one of the first examples of a bony fish, changing the history of fish evolution - as it was thought cartilage-based fish evolved first.</p>

<p>Placoderms died out in an mysterious mass extinction event 359 million years ago that could have been the result of a supernova explosion.</p>

<p>The Imperial team say the discover proves sharks evolved from creatures that had skeletons made of bone - rather than cartilage skeletons existing before bone.</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Martin Brazeau, of Imperial College London, said: 'We currently only have part of the skull roof and braincase - but it was covered in a thick bony armour.</p>

<p>'We know from its relationships to other similar fishes from this time it would likely have had an extensive armour on the face and shoulder.'</p>

<p>The animal described in Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution sheds fresh light on shark evolution, Brazeau and colleagues explained.</p>

<p>Whale sharks, the world's biggest fish, can reach over 60 feet. The Great White, the largest predatory fish, grow to more than 20 feet.</p>

<p>Minjinia belonged to a group called the placoderms. They were the first jawed fish out of which sharks and other vertebrates - including humans - evolved.</p>

<p>Some turned into 30 foot sea monsters with the articulated plates on their skulls evolving to perform the function of teeth. The rest of the body was scaled or naked.</p>

<p>Dr Brazeau said: 'So, it would superficially have looked like other placoderms.'</p>

<p>'Indeed, we have found fragments of armour with a similar pattern of ornamentation to the skull roof in the same rock bed. </p>

<p>'These suggest there would have been bony spines sitting in front of the fins, acting as either a cutwater or a defence. However, we don't yet have a full or partial skeleton. </p>

<p>Minjinia's fossilised skull - dug up in the foothills of spectacular snow capped mountains of Mongolia - changes our understanding of shark evolution</p>

<p>'Like the vast majority of fishes from this time, it was likely predatory - but it's not yet possible to say exactly what it ate without the direct preservation of the jaws.'</p>

<p>Today, sharks' skeletons are made of cartilage - which is around half the density of bone. It was thought to be the original template before the heavier alternative.</p>

<p>Minjinia completely contradicts this, according to the Imperial team.</p>

<p>It was a long held-view that cartilage came first - sharks were believed to have split from other animals prior to the arrival of bone.</p>

<p>The theory was that sharks kept the cartilage structure even though the majority of fish evolved with bony skeletons.  </p>

<p>Minjinia is a shared ancestor of sharks and the bony skeleton fish.</p>

<p>It suggests sharks had bones and then lost them - rather than keeping their initial cartilaginous state for over 400 million years.</p>

<p>Dr Brazeau said: 'It was very unexpected. Conventional wisdom says a bony inner skeleton was a unique innovation of the lineage that split from the ancestor of sharks more than 400 million years ago,.</p>

<p>'But here is clear evidence of bony inner skeleton in a cousin of both sharks and, ultimately, us.'</p>

<p>When we are developing as foetuses, humans and bony vertebrates have skeletons made of cartilage - like sharks.</p>

<p>But a key stage in our development is when this is replaced by hard 'endochondral' bone that makes up our skeleton after birth.</p>

<p>This is the dig site in the Turgen region of western Mongolia where the fossil remains of the boney ancient fish were found</p>

<p>Previously, no placoderm had been found with this, said Dr Brazeau, who added that the skull fragments of Minjinia were 'wall-to-wall endochondral'.</p>

<p>It points to a more interesting history for sharks - suggesting the development of a cartilage skeleton was an 'evolutionary adaptation'. </p>

<p>'Sharks don't have swim bladders, which evolved later in bony fish, but a lighter skeleton would have helped them be more mobile in the water and swim at different depths,' said Brazeau.</p>

<p>'This may be what helped sharks to be one of the first global fish species, spreading out into oceans around the world 400 million years ago.'</p>

<p>Sharks are remarkably resilient - they've survived all five global mass extinctions that knocked 80 per cent of the planet's mega-fauna out of existence.</p>

<p>But tracing their evolution is frustrating as fossilised cartilage does not preserve as well as bone - so there are few remains to examine.</p>

<p>The researchers still have plenty of other material collected from Mongolia to sort through - and perhaps find similar early bony fish.</p>

<p>The placoderms thrived for almost 60 million years - a period dubbed the 'Age of Fish' but they were wiped out in a mysterious mass extinction 359 million years ago.</p>

<p>That was 120 million years before the first dinosaurs walked across the Earth. </p>

<p>Last month a study suggested this mass extinction event was caused by radiation from an exploding star 65 light years from Earth.</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. </p>

<p>Sharks are the most efficient predators on earth and have long terrified humans.</p>

<p>Their basic design has never really changed over the course of 200million years and they are considered to be complex and intelligent.</p>

<p>Their teeth are fear factor number one, with the great white's teeth growing up to two-and-a-half inches in length.</p>

<p>Their prey are impaled on the pointed teeth of the lower jaw where they saw away sections of the flesh. The serrated edges of the teeth help with this process.</p>

<p>Their teeth are brittle and are constantly breaking off but are also constantly regrowing and on average there are 15 rows of teeth present in the mouth at one time.</p>

<p>Sharks are the most efficient predators on earth. Their basic design has never really changed over the course of 200million years</p>

<p>Their speed is fear factor number two. </p>

<p>They are very fast in the water compared to humans with the mako shark able to reach an incredible 60mph in bursts.</p>

<p>The great white can reach speeds of 25mph. </p>

<p>By comparison, 5mph is the fastest a human being can reach.</p>

<p>A shark's power and size terrifies us, too.   </p>

<p>The great white shark can grow up to 20 feet and while it has no particular taste for humans even an exploratory bite is enough to cut a man in half.</p>

<p>Most sharks release a human after its first bite but sometimes, that's all it take to kill a person.   </p>

<p>However, sharks have far more reason to be afraid of humans. We kill up to a million of them a year, often just cutting off their fins to make into soup and throwing the rest of the shark back into the water, where it starves or drowns. </p>
