<p>It is set to be released in 2021 on an Australian commercial broadcaster, and will be streamed to a global audience of more than 190 countries on Netflix.</p>

<p>Dive Club follows the lives of a group of teenage divers who strive to uncover a mysterious disappearance which will change their small town, and each other, forever. </p>

<p>Producer and show-runner Steve Jaggi always envisaged the series as a Queensland production, with Port Douglas being 'exactly the tropical wonderland I pictured Cape Mercy to be in my imagination'.</p>

<p>'Following our positive experience of shooting This Little Love of Mine in the region, the decision to return to Port Douglas and FNQ was an easy one,' he said.</p>

<p>'We are proud to be a Queensland based company and are always thrilled to be working with the fantastic cast and crew that our very own home state has to offer.' </p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk added that the filming of Dive Club would 'create in excess of 110 jobs for Queenslanders and inject nearly $8million into the economy'.</p>

<p>'Dive Club will showcase the tropical paradise location of Port Douglas and its lush surrounds to audiences across Australia, and the world, while providing jobs and training opportunities for established and emerging local crew permanently based in Queensland,' she said in a statement.</p>

<p>'Supporting this production is one component in our delivery of The Far North Queensland Screen Production Strategic Plan, which is successfully generating positive economic impact in the region.'  </p>

<p>Dive Club will be the third Steve Jaggi Company production, following Swimming for Gold in Brisbane and This Little Love of Mine in Cairns, which will be released to cinemas in 2021.</p>

<p>Other Netflix rom-coms to feature Queensland as their backdrop recently include Romance on the Menu.</p>

<p>The film, which has been described 'Eat Pray Love meets The Holiday', is now available on the streaming service and follows Cindy Busby (Caroline Wilson), a New York restaurateur, who inherits an Australian café and falls for a local chef. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, several major productions are set to take place in Queensland in the coming months, including the long-awaited scripted Tiger King series.</p>

<p>The show will be filmed in Brisbane, which will add millions to the local economy.</p>

<p>Two other shows, including one starring Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, will film in the state over the next 18 months as part of a $20million deal the Australian Government made with NBCUniversal's Universal Studio Group, reports the Courier Mail. </p>
