<p>Cutting back: Shareholders will receive it's £873m in payouts, according to estimates from Link Group</p>

<p>This is down 34 per cent from a record 2019, when junior market investors were given £1.33billion. </p>

<p>But the £873m forecast is Link's best-case scenario. Its most pessimistic forecast is down 48 per cent to £698m. </p>

<p>Much of the drop has been driven by companies slashing or halting dividends because of the Covid crisis.</p>

<p>Large firms – including about half of the FTSE 100 – have also made cuts, hitting ordinary investors who rely on dividends as a source of passive income.</p>
