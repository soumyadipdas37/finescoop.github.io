<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cristiano Ronaldo believes happier players under Andrea Pirlo is the reason Juventus are still on course for a record 10th consecutive Serie A title.</p>

<p>The Portuguese superstar, who scored a brace on Sunday night to secure a point away against Roma, was left to reflect on the first dropped points of the 2020-21 campaign. </p>

<p>And while Inter Milan, who finished a point off Juventus last season, have strengthened this summer, Ronaldo is predicting a 'bright future' for the champions with Pirlo at the helm, instead of Maurizio Sarri.  </p>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo remains convinced Juventus have a 'bright future' despite slipping up </p>

<p>The Portuguese star believes players 'play with a smile' under new boss Andrea Pirlo (right)</p>

<p>'We're at the start of the season, there's a new coach, new ideas, but I see the team working well,' he told Sky Sport Italia. </p>

<p>'We're enthusiastic and I see a bright future for us. What we're seeing is that the team is happy to work with a smile.'</p>

<p>Roma took the lead at the Olimpico from the penalty spot through Jordan Veretout before a penalty at the other end allowed Ronaldo to level.</p>

<p>But naive defending allowed the hosts to strike again, and it was Veretout again finishing off a quick counter-attack. </p>

<p>Maurizio Sarri was sacked at the end of last season with the mood at the club below par</p>

<p>Adrien Rabiot picked up his second yellow just after the hour to reduce Juventus to 10-men but a trademark Ronaldo header 20 minutes from time completed the comeback and they showed real grit and determination to hold on from there. </p>

<p>Sarri was sacked after a dismal Champions League last-16 exit to Lyon and having not won that competition since 1996, that remains one of the club's biggest objectives for Pirlo's debut campaign. </p>

<p>Ronaldo visibly clashed with the Italian on multiple occasions and fans became frustrated by his 'Sarri-ball' tactics. Under Pirlo the mood has been completely flipped. </p>

<p>Ronaldo started in a front two alongside summer arrival Alvaro Morata and while he fell flat on his first game back, he already has one eye on Europe. </p>

<p>'Leaving Juventus was not up to me,' he explained. 'I was happy in Madrid, but now it's important for me to be here and I have kept in touch with everyone over the years.</p>

<p>Ronaldo once again produced a rescue act to save Juventus as they were held 2-2 by Roma</p>

<p>Alvaro Morata started alongside Ronaldo and he admits the Champions League is critical</p>

<p>'It was a great memory and now we have new challenges to face together.</p>

<p>'The Champions League is very important to Juventus. If we were to win it this year, I would be the happiest man in the world. We want to win it.'</p>

<p>Juventus have taken four points from a possible six having beaten Sampdoria in Turin last week. </p>

<p>They now prepare to face an in-form Napoli next weekend after Gennaro Gattuso's side put on a 6-0 masterclass against Genoa.  </p>
