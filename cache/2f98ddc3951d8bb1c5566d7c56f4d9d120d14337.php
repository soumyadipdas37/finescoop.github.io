<p>The spine-tingling footage was shot last week at the Gettysburg Civil War battle site in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Greg Yuelling, 46, took the ghostly video as he was driving through the historic site on a visit with his family. </p>

<p>A couple of spooky apparitions (one circled) were caught on camera running across the road at what is widely believed to be one of the most haunted places in America</p>

<p>'We just went there as tourists, to learn more about the history of the Civil War and see the old battleground, where the Gettysburg Address was given and all that stuff.</p>

<p>'We were driving along one night and we started hearing noises, I heard things to the left and my uncle heard things to the right, and there was a fog, but the fog was weird, it was only in one patch not dispersed,' he told The Sun.</p>

<p>'Then we saw these shapes moving in the darkness, they were the size of humans, one of them ran right through the cannon. It was scary, it was crazy. My uncle got so scared he rolled up the window.'</p>

<p>'We went back and watched the videos over and over again, and then we blew them up on the big screen to get a closer look. That made us even more freaked out,' he said.</p>

<p>'It was really exciting, but I also got this strange, ominous feeling, like something was telling me to go back there,' Yuelling said. 'I couldn't go to sleep but I was creeped out, so I didn't go.'</p>

<p>The site of Gettysburg was where one of the most brutal and bloodiest battles of the American Civil War took place in 1863 as Union and Confederate fought.</p>

<p>Up to 51,000 soldiers are thought to have died in the three-day long battle together with 5,000 horses. </p>

<p>Soldiers died in triage units that had been set up around the perimeter of the site while many more bled to death on the battlefield as the battle raged. An aerial image shows the graves of Union soldiers killed during the Battle of Gettysburg </p>

<p>'I've heard people say you can catch videos of ghosts around there, but we were so skeptical until that night,' said Yuelling who had long been a sceptic. </p>

<p>'I always questioned the validity of those ghost videos you see on TV, I was always pretty disbelieving. I believe everything now.'  </p>

<p>The video was uploaded to YouTube where one person commented with a rational explanation for the spooky sight. </p>

<p>'Its nothing more than a reflection from the headlights of his car reflecting back off the canons onto the water streak on his window. Look closely and you can see the streak of water a second or two before the "ghosts" seemingly appear and they loop over the wheels of the canons in sync with the water streak. It's nothing more than that.'</p>
