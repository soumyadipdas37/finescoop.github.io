<p>Harriett and Taşer welcomed baby Hudson Harley, now one, into the world in August 2018, with fans only learning of their relationship months before when she split with Stephanie Davis' ex Sam Reece.   </p>

<p>The reality beauty and her beau took to their respective Instagram accounts back in January 2018 to reveal to their delighted followers that they were set to become parents.</p>

<p>Taking to the photosharing site, she penned the caption: 'I'm so excited to finally announce my little beautiful secret. Taşer and I are expecting our first baby i feel so truly blessed what a way to start 2018!'</p>

<p>Fans only learnt of their relationship in October 2017 when she finally confirmed split claims about her relationship with Stephanie Davis' ex Sam Reece.</p>

<p>After months together, Sam and Harriette were plagued with break-up claims in August although he quashed the rumours when he insisted: 'Things are good'. </p>

<p>When Harriette appeared on Ex On The Beach in 2016 she struck up a connection with hunky Ross Worswick, who first found fame in the inaugural series of the show.</p>

<p>The stunner immediately caught the eye of the Mancunian hunk, yet the entrance of fellow Essex girl and former TOWIE star Nicole Bass threw a spanner in the works.  </p>
