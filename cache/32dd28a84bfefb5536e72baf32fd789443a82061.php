<p>An appeal for funding was launched last year after it was announced the paddle steamer would not sail in 2019.</p>

<p>Waverley's 2020 sailing season was severely reduced due to Covid-19 from over five months to just a few weeks.</p>

<p>Passenger capacity was reduced to under 30 per cent resulting in an immediate funding crisis to meet the cost of the coming winter period.</p>

<p>The paddle steamer was built by A &amp; J Inglis of Glasgow and first launched in October 1946.</p>

<p>In June 2009, it struck the breakwater at Dunoon with 700 passengers on board, 12 of whom suffered minor injuries.</p>
