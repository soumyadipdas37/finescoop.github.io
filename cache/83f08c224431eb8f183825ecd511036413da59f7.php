<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The world's most fashionable women are now wearing knitted sweater vests, previously reserved for doting grandfathers and the country club golf course.</p>

<p>Long ridiculed as a crime against fashion, sleeveless knitwear has become 2020's most unlikely trend after being seen on style-conscious celebrities from pop icon Harry Styles to supermodel Elsa Hosk.</p>

<p>The reincarnation started in Scandinavia in early 2019, when Danish labels Ganni and Stine Goya and Swedish favourite Acne Studios started selling ironically 'cool' cropped knits that could have been plucked straight from your grandpa's closet.</p>

<p>Previously reserved for grandfathers and country club golf courses, sleeveless sweater vests are now being worn by the some of world's most fashionable women like Swedish influencer Matilda Djerf (pictured)</p>

<p>Trendsetters like New York fashion blogger Grace-Caroline Larcade (pictured) are styling loose-fitting knits over pleated mini-skirts</p>

<p>Kitsch vests have since received the seal of approval from fashion's elite, appearing on the Fall/Winter 2020 runways of behemoths like Gucci, Prada and Dior over flowing maxi-skirts and high-waisted culottes.</p>

<p>But in good news for Australians, they're equally suitable for spring in the southern hemisphere, providing ample warmth without the cumbersome weight of a long-sleeved jacket. </p>

<p>In other words, sweater vests are the perfect solution for seasonal cusps when no one is quite sure what the weather will hold from one day to the next. </p>

<p>The trend first started in Scandinavia in 2019 at labels like Ganni and Stine Goya, and locals like Norwegian fashion writer Nnenna Echem (pictured) quickly cottoned on</p>

<p>On Instagram - where comments reveal the best pieces can be found in vintage and thrift stores - trend-setting influencers are styling loose-fitting knits over pleated mini-skirts, distressed denim and baggy track pants.</p>

<p>Tight, cropped varieties are layered over silk midi-dresses and masculine-inspired shirts, while some daring women are rocking them as belly tops paired with slouchy suit trousers.</p>

<p>At Copenhagen Fashion Week in August 2019 - months before the term COVID-19 appeared in headlines - one guest even wore an over-sized 'grandpa' vest on its own as a dress.</p>

<p>Nasty Gal 'Tell Us Houndstooth Knitted Vest Top' - $20 </p>

<p>Shein 'Cable Knit Sweater Vest' - $23.95 </p>

<p>Zara 'Knit Sweater Vest with Pockets' - $39.95 </p>

<p>Boden 'Favourite Cotton Knitted Tank' - $85</p>

<p>But even now, in the midst of the pandemic, sweater vests remain a mainstay in wardrobes around the world as they prove to be exceptionally comfortable working from home attire. </p>

<p>And while the rebirth of the 'grandpa' vest is unexpected, it's not the first time historically 'uncool' clothing has found its way to the forefront of fashion.</p>

<p>In July, chunky zip-up fleeces that once epitomised fashion failure were deemed the 'hottest trend for winter in Australia'.</p>

<p>Previously confined to the wardrobes of middle-aged men, the practical - and until recently, downright 'daggy' - jumpers have been hijacked by industry giants who transformed them into a must-have staple for stylish women.</p>

<p>The versatile design, which is characterised by zips that stop one quarter or halfway down the front of the jumper, looks equally chic paired with leather skirts, relaxed-fit 'mum' jeans or skintight split-leg pants.</p>

<p>'Half-zip' knits have been worn by Hollywood icons and catwalk megastars - even becoming a firm favourite of the 'world's most beautiful woman', Bella Hadid.</p>

<p>Best of all they don't break the bank, with trendy styles starting from $39.99 from some of Australia's top fashion labels like Cotton On, Fila and Target.</p>
