<p>I'm A Celebrity bosses have reportedly forked out millions to make the 19th-century castle where this year's series is being held in North Wales safe.</p>

<p>It has apparently been a costly affair to transform the castle into a TV set, as workers installed electrics and pipes to provide the location with running water. </p>

<p>According to the Sun, the star-studded line-up of campmates will be housed under a waterproof roof in a show first to protect them from the bitter UK climate.  </p>

<p>A show source said: 'This isn't a holiday camp for the stars, but without a roof, everyone would have been utterly miserable for three weeks, which would not make great telly.</p>

<p>'It will still be hard work but slightly warmer than if it snows where they are sleeping. ITV want viewers to largely recognise the show.' </p>

<p>In pictures obtained by the publication, a studio where hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly has been erected, as well as an uncovered area where contestants will be allowed to light a camp fire.</p>

<p>Changes: This year's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here will be filmed at Gwrych Castle in North Wales, after being forced to relocate due to the COVID-19 pandemic</p>

<p>A section of the location where they will sleep has been covered with strong plastic to keep the winds and rain at bay.</p>

<p>MailOnline have contacted I'm A Celebrity for comment. </p>

<p>Last month Kevin Lygo, the Director of Television at ITV, has revealed that all stars for this year's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! have been confirmed. </p>

<p>And while rumours circulate that Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn, presenter Vernon Kay, and Coronation Street's Beverley Callard have signed up, Lygo assures all of the as-yet-unnamed stars have been confirmed – despite the change of location.</p>
