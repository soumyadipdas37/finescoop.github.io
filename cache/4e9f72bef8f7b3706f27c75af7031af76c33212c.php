<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Michel Barnier and the UK's David Frost are holding emergency talks today amid gathering misery about the prospects for a Brexit trade deal.</p>

<p>The EU negotiator is coming to London for the meeting as the hunt for a breakthrough becomes increasingly desperate.  </p>

<p>With effectively just a month to thrash out trade terms in time for the end of the transition period, the bloc has been complaining that Britain is being 'intransigent and unrealistic'.</p>

<p>But angry UK sources point out that Mr Barnier is refusing even to discuss proposals on access to fishing waters - one of the key issues alongside whether the UK must follow Brussels rules.</p>

<p>Mr Frost is expected to confront his counterpart today on his policy of 'parallelism', which means he will not negotiate on an area until Britain has made significant concessions on others.  </p>

<p>A UK source told the Times that the EU team was not 'engaging' on so-called 'room papers' that could form the basis for a deal.</p>

<p>'The EU has always said that fishing is a key issue for resolution but has subsequently declined to discuss it,' they said.</p>

<p>'We had hoped to make progress and presented room papers but, unfortunately, the EU refused to engage due to their self-imposed requirements.' </p>

<p>Formal negotiations between the two sides will resume next week. </p>

<p>A Whitehall source said that although the UK's transition period from the EU is not due to finish until the end of the year, there is 'realistically only a month' to agree a deal in time for it to be ratified.</p>

<p>Both sides have become increasingly gloomy about the prospects for a deal in recent weeks after hopes of a summer breakthrough faded.</p>

<p>France yesterday accused Britain of deliberately stalling post-Brexit trade deal negotiations and having unreasonable expectations.</p>

<p>Speaking to his nation's ambassadors, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: 'Negotiations are not advancing because of the intransigent and unrealistic attitude of the United Kingdom.' </p>

<p>But British sources said the deadlock was due to the EU's intransigence.</p>

<p>'They don't seem to be prepared to move on any of the big things,' one said.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson has said that from the end of this year, the UK will determine access for foreign trawlers in British waters, in common with other independent coastal states.</p>

<p>But the EU is demanding that its fishing fleet continues to enjoy its existing access rights indefinitely. </p>

<p>Brussels is also demanding to know details of the UK's state aid regime – the rules on bailouts of struggling companies and sectors – before moving on to other areas of negotiation.</p>

<p>The EU wants guarantees that the UK will not undercut its own industries.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson (pictured on a visit to a school last month) has said that from the end of this year, the UK will determine access for foreign trawlers in British waters, in common with other independent coastal states</p>

<p>But British ministers insist that as an independent country, the UK should be free to set its own industrial policy.</p>

<p>Mr Le Drian insisted yesterday the bloc of 27 will not buckle under pressure from London, adding: 'On Brexit we always showed unity and proved wrong those who saw signs of an overall implosion of Europe. </p>

<p>'It is in staying united that we can stick to our line of a global accord.'</p>

<p>But UK ministers are also confident Mr Johnson will not back down, raising the prospect of leaving without a trade deal at the end of this year unless negotiators can achieve a sudden breakthrough.</p>
