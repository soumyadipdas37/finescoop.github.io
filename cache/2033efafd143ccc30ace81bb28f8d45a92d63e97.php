<p>Just as many had speculated over the past week, the firm unveiled the Apple Watch Series 6 with the biggest addition of blood oxygen measurements. Built-in sensors that lay on the wrist are capable of measuring the color of blood flowing through the body to determine levels of oxygen in just 15 seconds</p>

<p>Apple announced last week that it would be hosting a live virtual event on September 15 at 1pm ET, but without any details about what viewers could expect.</p>

<p>However, many assumed it would be the unveiling of the new Apple Watch and that is exactly what they got. </p>

<p>The Apple Watch Series 6 is the first design to come in a stunning blue aluminum finish and the firm's own Product Red, and users can choose from seven new bands when ordered.</p>

<p>There are new faces, including Memoji, that users can customize to fit their needs and personality.</p>

<p>The biggest update is the sensors that measure oxygen levels, which Apple is using to partner with healthcare professionals and networks to conduct larger studies.</p>

<p>These studies will investigate how to control asthma to managing heart diseases to monitoring coronavirus symptoms. </p>

<p>The Series 6 is also 26 percent faster than its predecessors and is equipped with a high-performance dual processor used in the iPhone 11 - just redesigned into a smaller version. </p>

<p>It has Apple's in-house A13 chip and is said to be the biggest update to the device's performance since the Series 4, released in 2018.</p>
