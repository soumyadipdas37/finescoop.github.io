<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The disappearance of a British care worker, who vanished in France a year ago and whose car was found abandoned nearby, is being investigated by police.</p>

<p>Mother-of-two Karen Milsom, 52, left her home in the Charente region with some clothes and £5,400 of Euros after an outburst in the house she shared with electrician husband Steven.</p>

<p>Mrs Milsom, who was born in Bristol, had been a carer for an elderly British women before she disappeared after they moved to France 15 years ago.</p>

<p>Her husband Steven said police had been through their house with sniffer dog and even emptied their septic tank.</p>

<p>Officers are understood to be probing three theories: that she left to start a new life , may have committed suicide, or had been murdered.</p>

<p>Mr Milsom said he thought she would come back after she took their car, but said she texted him to say the vehicle was at nearby Ruffec station.</p>

<p>He added: ‘She had been fishing for an argument. She was in one of her moods.</p>

<p>‘She said no one cared about her. She would fly off the handle and then a couple of hours later she would apologise.</p>

<p>Mother-of-two Karen Milsom, 52, left her home in the Charente region in August last year</p>

<p>The family car was found at Ruffec Station 25 miles away three weeks later after a tip-off</p>

<p>‘I was gobsmacked when she left. She said she would be in contact as and when she wanted to.</p>

<p>‘Three weeks later, I got a text off her to say that the car was at Ruffec station.</p>

<p>‘She left of her own accord. I really don't know what could have happened. I don't think she'd have taken her life. I had two phone calls from withheld numbers. I spoke to her and it was a strange conversation.’</p>

<p>He told the Guardian: ‘Maybe she was craving a more exciting life. I'm hoping she's going to show her face, but at the moment I'm in limbo."</p>

<p>Mr Milsom said he reported her missing to the police three weeks later after it became clear she was not coming home.</p>

<p>She vanished in August and the Gendarmerie has made appeals for witnesses as it investigated what has happened.</p>

<p>Mrs Milsom and her family had moved to the Charente region 15 years ago to live</p>

<p>One of her friends Claire McDermott received a text from her in September last year and she believed she had been bored with her life in France.</p>

<p>Ms McDermott said: ‘She felt she had nothing to look forward to.’</p>

<p>The message said she would be back in December to explain, but she has not been seen again.</p>

<p>Another friend Sue Jones added: ‘She was a very bubbly person, very caring and empathetic.</p>

<p>‘But I knew she wasn't very happy.’</p>

<p>She said that Milsom's mother had killed herself when her daughter was a teenager.</p>

<p>She said: ‘I find it hard to believe that she would do that to her children.’</p>

<p>Milsom is one of more than 800 missing people on the files of the Lucie Blackman Trust.</p>

<p>It said in an appeal: 'Karen has not been seen nor heard from since around 20th August 2019.</p>

<p>She has been living in France for 15 years and has kept in regular touch with her family.</p>

<p>'Therefore this disappearance, from her home in Charente, France, is completely out of character and there are serious concerns for her.'</p>
