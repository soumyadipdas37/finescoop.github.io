<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>On Tuesday, Karl Stefanovic was quick to slam Ellen DeGeneres' lacklustre apology over allegations that her talk show harboured a toxic workplace.</p>

<p>And Kyle Sandilands slammed the 46-year-old Today host on Wednesday for seemingly taking Ellen's apology personally.</p>

<p>'Oh shut up Karl. I'll ring him up today and chew his a**e out,' Kyle, 49, snapped on his KIIS 106.5 breakfast radio show.</p>

<p>Radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands (pictured) has snapped at Today show host Karl Stefanovic after he slammed comedian Ellen DeGeneres' apology on national television</p>

<p>'What are you going to do?' asked Kyle's co-host Jackie 'O' Henderson.</p>

<p>'No, that term is a saying...' Kyle said, to which Jackie replied: 'I don't think Karl will understand what that term is...'</p>

<p>It comes after Karl and his Today co-host Allison Langdon lashed out at Ellen, 62, 'weird and uncomfortable' comedic undertones in her monologue.</p>

<p>Not impressed! Speaking on his KIIS 106.5 radio show, Kyle, 49, said: 'Oh shut up Karl. I'll ring him up today and chew his a**e out' </p>

<p>Shocked: Jackie began to laugh and asked: 'What are you going to do?' To which Kyle replied: 'No, that term is a saying...' Jackie then said: I don't think Karl will understand what that term is'</p>

<p>On Monday, the comedian kicked off the 18th season of her daytime talk show by telling her virtual audience she was 'taking responsibility' for the scandal, while also acknowledging she was not the behind-the-scenes villain that several reports had suggested.</p>

<p>Karl, a longtime fan of Ellen's, seemed personally disappointed by the fact she had interspersed her apology with a few jokes, and somberly suggested it was time for her to 'go away and re-establish her connection' with the people who matter. </p>

<p>Over the last few months, Ellen has faced allegations that she treated staffers with little or no respect and that senior producers allowed and encouraged a toxic work environment. </p>

<p>Viewpoints: Allison (centre right) lashed out at the American comedian for the 'weird and uncomfortable' comedic undertones in her five-minute monologue, and Karl (left) suggested it was time for her to 'go away and re-establish her connection' with the people who matter</p>

<p>As she addressed these claims, she also squeezed in a few lighthearted gags.</p>

<p>Ellen's delivery left Allison unimpressed, however, as she told Nine's U.S. correspondent Amelia Adams: 'You could tell she wasn't comfortable delivering it. She got the tone completely wrong.</p>

<p>'If that was a male talk show host and he was opening the show to address allegations of sexual harassment and bullying, and he made jokes about it, we wouldn't cop it as an audience. </p>

<p>'But somehow because it's Ellen and she is a comedian that is okay.'</p>

<p>When asked for his opinion on the matter, Karl was clearly disappointed as he explained: 'Ellen has brought me so much enjoyment over the years. </p>

<p>'I love watching her, and I love her delivery, but I think that monologue at the start kind of highlighted that she is not as connected as she once was to the people, like myself, who are such great fans of hers.</p>

<p>'Maybe it's about her going away and trying to re-establish that connection with the fans and the people who she really always looked after. They came first.'</p>

<p>Apology: On Monday, the comedian kicked off the 18th season of her daytime talk show by telling her virtual audience she was 'taking responsibility' for the scandal, while also acknowledging she was not the behind-the-scenes villain that several reports had suggested</p>
