<p>The 22-year-old saw a move to Liverpool fall through earlier this summer and had interest from Crystal Palace and Leicester after an impressive season in the top-flight with Norwich last term. </p>

<p>Lewis played 28 times for Daniel Farke's side but couldn't stop his team from suffering relegation straight back to the Championship. </p>

<p>Newcastle completed deals for Bournemouth duo Callum Wilson (left) and Ryan Fraser (right)</p>

<p>Lewis played 90 minutes for Northern Ireland in Friday night's 1-1 draw with Romania but will not feature at all for the Norway clash. </p>

<p>The match on Friday was Lewis' 18th international cap of his career, having made his Northern Ireland debut in 2018. </p>
