<p>'These days we're in a situation where we can't understand what is a handball and what isn't. It's an absolute nonsense, I don't want to profit form it or lose to it, there's no doubt it's killing the game.</p>

<p>Referee Kevin Friend awarded a penalty to Everton after a lengthy pitchside VAR review</p>

<p>'I will predict what will happen, people will be flicking balls onto people's hands and screaming for handball and if you think that's going to make the game better then good luck to you. </p>

<p>'A really good game of football was killed by the decision today. I'm talking about referees too, I don't blame referees because he's got to give it because it's what he's been told to do.</p>

<p>'I would have been really happy with our team's performance at 1-1 but we have lost in a way that I find totally unacceptable.</p>

<p>He continued: 'It's bizarre how referees and VAR referees are getting these decisions so horrendously wrong. I can only presume it's because previously never had the chance to see replays in super slow motion. </p>

<p>'Important to watch things in normal time too. Different perception entirely.' </p>

<p>Former England women's international Eni Aluko was also left dismayed by the decision, adding: 'I never thought I'd say this as a striker but I feel sorry for defenders. </p>

<p>'I'm not sure what they're meant to do. I get a bit confused, it's not outside of his body line, he's not leant towards the ball but it's given.'</p>
