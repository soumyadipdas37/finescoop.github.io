<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kyle Walker Peters' red card against Crystal Palace was overturned by referee Jon Moss after he consulted the VAR pitchside monitor, in what has been described as a 'huge step forward for VAR' by ex-Premier League striker Michael Owen. </p>

<p>The Southampton right back was shown a straight red by Moss after a high foot on Palace defender Tyrick Mitchell.</p>

<p>But after the video assistant referee advised the on-field referee to consult the pitchside monitor - a move which was discouraged last season - Moss decided to downgrade his decision to a yellow card. </p>

<p>Kyle Walker Peters' red card was overturned by VAR after Jon Moss looked at the incident</p>

<p>The referee originally sent off the Southampton right back for what was deemed a high foot</p>

<p>Yet after Moss looked at the pitchside monitor, he decided to change his decision upon review</p>

<p>Given Walker-Peters' challenge wasn't with excessive force and seemed a genuinely mistimed attempt for the ball, it seemed the correct decision was eventually found. </p>

<p>And the reaction on social media was full of praise for the VAR process and Moss consulting the pitch-side monitor. </p>

<p>Former England international Owen tweeted: 'Huge step forward for VAR...</p>

<p>'John (sic) Moss makes the wrong call issuing a red card but sees the replay on the pitch side monitor and reversed his own decision. </p>

<p>Moss downgraded his own decision to a yellow card after looking at the video replay</p>

<p>'Hopefully a sign of things to come.' </p>

<p>Others on Twitter were also similarly surprised and satisfied with what occurred, with one saying: 'Breaking News!!!! VAR in England starts functioning.'</p>

<p>Another joked: 'Everyone who has Walker-Peters in fantasy must love VAR right about now.'</p>

<p>Despite the decision, Southampton couldn't use the VAR call to their advantage, as they slumped to a 1-0 defeat at Selhurst Park, courtesy of Wilfried Zaha's early volley.  </p>
