<p>Chef J Salsa, who shares content under the handle <?php echo e('@'); ?>_jahkt, upset fans of the pub chain after revealing that its curry was pre-made and simply warmed up before being served.</p>

<p>'You’re ruining Spoons for everyone,' one viewer told the worker, after he joked he 'didn't get paid enough' to reheat a plastic packet of rice and cook a naan bread on the grill.</p>

<p>Chef J Salsa, who shares content under the handle <?php echo e('@'); ?>_jahkt on TikTok, upset fans of the pub chain after revealing that its curry was pre-made (pictured) and simply warmed up before being served</p>

<p>However, others were impressed to discover that several elements of the firm's Full English breakfast were made from fresh ingredients and cooked on-site after the chef (pictured) showed how he would make the dish while at work</p>

<p>In his video showing how a korma was made, the chef explained: 'First up, warm up your defrosted chicken curry in the microwave for about two or three minutes along with your rice for another two minutes.</p>

<p>'Then I prepared these poppadoms earlier so just slap it on the plate. When your rice is ready slap it on the plate. I don’t get paid enough for this. </p>

<p>'Put your curry into the special traditional curry bowl, imported straight from India, custom made just for Spoons. Then put your bread onto the plate.'</p>

<p>His clip has received more than one million views on TikTok - with some customers shocked that the entire meal is pre-made. </p>

<p>One user commented: 'You mean to tell me that I pay £7.50 for a microwave meal,' while another said: 'Microwaved but still bangs.'</p>

<p>However, other viewers were very impressed when J Salsa showed how a classic Full English breakfast is created at the chain - with most the ingredients being cooked from fresh (pictured)</p>

<p>The chef starts by grilling two slices of bacon and frying an egg before deep frying some hash browns and putting a slice of bread on the grill. </p>

<p>He then adds pre-cooked grilled tomatoes, two sausages, and a spoonful of baked beans to the plate before serving it up.  </p>

<p>'Wait they don't actually microwave everything?" one asked, while another viewer added: 'I genuinely thought Spoons kitchens only had microwaves in.'</p>

<p>A third wrote: 'Why did I grow up thinking all food from Spoons was microwaved?', while another said: 'Wow it isn't actually just microwave food I am shook.'</p>
