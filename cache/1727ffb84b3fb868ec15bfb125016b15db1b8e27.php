<p>Experts from the Johannes Gutenberg University, studied the remains of Bronze Age warriors that were slain in 1200 BC on a river bank in what is now Germany. </p>

<p>A DNA analysis showed only one in eight had a gene that breaks down lactose - a type of sugar in milk. The mutation makes a special enzyme called lactase.</p>

<p>About 90 per cent of the population living in that same area have the ability to process lactose - suggesting the mutation spread in just a few thousand years. </p>

<p>Lead author Professor Joachim Burger said this was a huge difference when there can't have been more than 120 generations of humans between then and today. </p>

<p>The study, published in Current Biology, found that aside from lactase tolerance and a few other genetic variants, the genomes of the Bronze Age warriors were similar to those of today's inhabitants of northern Germany and the Baltic Sea region.  </p>

<p>Professor Daniel Wegmann, of the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, said the only way to explain this difference to today is 'very strong natural selection'.</p>

<p>'We conclude that over the past 3,000 years, lactase-persistent individuals had more children or, alternatively, those children had better chances of survival than those without this trait.' </p>

<p>'In each generation lactase-persistent individuals have a 6 per cent greater chance of surviving to reproductive age than non-lactase-persistent individuals,' he added. </p>

<p>Discovery of a mandible in the Tollense river. The study, published in Current Biology, found that aside from lactase tolerance and a few other genetic variants, the genomes of the bronze age warriors were similar to those of today's inhabitants of northern Germany and the Baltic Sea region</p>

<p>But researchers say there is still no answer to why being able to digest the sugar in milk after infancy provided such a big evolutionary advantage.</p>

<p>Many people are still intolerant to milk. the team said. Without lactase, milk causes unpleasant and anti social side effects including flatulence and cramping. </p>

<p>The study also analysed the genetic material in Bronze Age bones found in eastern and south-eastern Europe for comparison. </p>

<p>Scientists found these also showed low frequencies of lactase persistence.</p>

<p>The warrior remains from the Tollense Valley are from what researchers say was likely the oldest known battle in Europe.</p>

<p>Remains were first discovered there in the 1990s, and for more than 10 years archaeologists have been systematically searching the river for more.</p>

<p>The bones of more than 100 individuals have been discovered, many of them exhibiting signs of violent combat.</p>

<p>Many contain arrowheads, while some skulls had been crushed by blunt objects.  </p>

<p>Several thousand men are estimated to have been involved, some of whom were on horseback, according to Wegmann. </p>

<p>Milk is a weird thing to consume. It is a liquid made by a cow or other animal to feed its young - we squirt it from the cow's udders to obtain it.</p>

<p>According to the German research team - this gave those able to digest it during hte Bronze Age and beyond 'a remarkable selective advantage'.</p>

<p>Various bones at a Bronze Age battle excavation site, some of which were genetically tested to determine the presence of the lactase-persistent gene</p>

<p>When we are babies, lactase allows us to digest the lactose in our mother's milk. But after infancy, production used to stop. </p>

<p> Burger said each generation's lactase-persistent individuals have a six per cent greater chance of surviving to reproductive age than those without persistence.  </p>

<p>In 2007, the same team established almost none of the first sedentary farmers in Europe were lactase-persistent.</p>

<p>'It is astonishing at the time of the battle at the Tollense, more than 4,000 years after the introduction of agriculture in Europe, lactase persistence in adults was so rare.'</p>

<p>'With milk being a high energy, relatively uncontaminated drink, its ingestion may have provided greater chances of survival during food shortages or when supplies of drinking water were contaminated,' he added.</p>

<p>'Particularly during early childhood, in the years shortly after weaning, this factor often may have been decisive amongst prehistoric populations.'  </p>

<p>Archaeologists have been systematically searching a section along the Tollense river for more than 10 years</p>

<p>Today, drinking milk is common practice in northern Europe, the US and a patchwork of other places but in many cultures it is strictly off limits. </p>

<p>In 2000, China launched a nationwide campaign to encourage the consumption of milk and dairy products for health reasons.</p>

<p>It had to overcome the deep suspicions of older generations. Cheese, which is essentially milk that has been allowed to go off, can still make many Chinese people feel sick.</p>

<p>In northern Europe, more than 90 per cent of people are lactase persistent. But many Africans do not have the trait and it is also uncommon in Asia and South America.</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Current Biology. </p>

<p>A dairy allergy is when the body's immune system reacts unusually to dairy.</p>

<p>Reactions to dairy, like other triggers, are usually mild, causing red rashes, itches, swelling and even vomiting.</p>

<p>However, they can prove deadly and lead to anaphylactic shock - which can kill in minutes.</p>

<p>It leads to a catastrophic drop in blood pressure and can trigger a cardiac arrest - when the heart suddenly stops working.</p>

<p>About 20 people in the UK die as a result of anaphylactic shock each year, according to figures.</p>

<p>Experts are unsure how many people have a dairy allergies, but claim they are one of the most common types of allergies.</p>

<p>The NHS advises patients with a dairy allergy, or allergies to other potential triggers such as peanuts, to avoid the food completely.</p>

<p>Dairy allergy is different to lactose intolerance, which is a common digestive problem to lactose - often found in milk. </p>
