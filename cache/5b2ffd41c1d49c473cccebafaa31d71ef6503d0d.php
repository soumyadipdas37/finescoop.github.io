<p>Their night out comes as AJ has been tipped to appear on this year's series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!</p>

<p>A source told The Sun that the dancer is being lined up for the show which is being held in a castle in Wales this year instead of Australia due to the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>

<p>The source said: 'Strictly would like to think that no one leaves the show and goes on to bigger things, but AJ will be very popular in the jungle and it'll be a good platform for him.</p>

<p>'His deal is all but done and ITV are delighted they've been able to prize him away from their rivals.'</p>

<p>AJ's representatives were contacted by MailOnline for comment at the time. </p>

<p>Abbie and AJ first got together in 2018 after Abbie auditioned for AJ's Get on the Floor live tour. </p>
