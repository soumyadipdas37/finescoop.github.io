<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lindsay Lohan is reportedly being sued by publishing company HarperCollins for failing to write a book despite being paid a handsome advance to do so. </p>

<p>HarperCollins claim that Lohan, 34, breached a contract that she signed with them in March 2014, with a promise to turn in the title - rumored to be a tell-all biography - by May 2015, which never materialized. </p>

<p>In legal documents filed by the publishing house, they claim Lohan was given a revised date of March 2017 to get it finished, and that they even paid her an advance of $365k against future royalties, TMZ reports. </p>

<p>The Publishing Trap! Lindsay Lohan is reportedly being sued by publishing company HarperCollins for failing to write a book after she was paid an advance</p>

<p>DailyMail.com has reached out to representatives for the Mean Girls star, who has so far been unavailable for comment.</p>

<p>Legal documents obtained by the site reportedly say that HarperCollins told Lohan the deal was off in September of 2018, and asked for their money back. </p>

<p>However, Lohan allegedly never returned the funds she received. The Parent Trap star is being sued for the $365k advance, as well as interest and legal charges. </p>

<p>In 2014, it was reported that Lohan was set to sign a staggering $1 million deal to write her memoir for HarperCollins. </p>

<p>The news came after Lohan spent time in rehab 2013, and reportedly kept a much-discussed diary, where she allegedly wrote a list of the famous men she had slept with.</p>

<p>'It's more or less an autobiography, but she had a minimal number of sample pages,' a source told PageSix at the time. </p>

<p>No comment: Lindsay, 34, has yet to respond to the claim by HarperCollins </p>

<p>In 2014, during an appearance on - where else - but Andy Cohen's Watch What Happens Live, Lohan spoke about her list of lovers, which must have clearly caught the attention of the publishing industry. </p>

<p>InTouch weekly had published a hand-written list of famous men that Lohan allegedly slept with, and referring to the photo she said: 'That was actually my fifth step in AA at Betty Ford.'</p>

<p>'And someone, when I was moving during the OWN show, must have taken a photo of it. And so that's a really personal thing and it's really unfortunate…'</p>
