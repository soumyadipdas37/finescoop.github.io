<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Department of Homeland Security held back on releasing an intelligence warning to law enforcement agencies that Russia was pushing out political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden's mental health – a line of attack that President Trump himself has promoted.</p>

<p>After receipt of the bulletin citing 'allegations about the poor mental health' of Biden, a senior aide advised to hold back its release pending review by DHS head Chad Wolf, who was serving on an acting capacity at the time. He is now Trump's nominee to lead the agency but lacks Senate confirmation.</p>

<p>The draft bulletin being circulated was titled: 'Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election,' and was intended to alert law enforcement to keep on the lookout, according to ABC News, which obtained internal emails about the document. </p>

<p>The Department of Homeland Security held back on releasing an intelligence warning to law enforcement agencies that Russia was pushing out political attacks on Democrat Joe Biden's mental health after an aide flagged it for acting DHS chief Chad Wolf's review</p>

<p>In the document, U.S. analysts stated their 'high confidence' that 'Russian malign influence actors are likely to continue denigrating presidential candidates through allegations of poor mental or physical health to influence the outcome of the 2020 election.'</p>

<p>The agency distributed the draft for review, including to an office that handles legislative and public affairs, on July 7, to be released to law enforcement within days – at a time when Donald Trump was already attacking Biden as 'Sleepy Joe' and someone who was staff driven and lacking in mental capacity. </p>

<p>But Homeland Security chief of staff John Gountanis penned an email putting the brakes on it. 'Please hold on sending this one out until you have a chance to speak to' to Wolf, he wrote. </p>

<p>The bulletin never went out, and an agency spokesperson told the network it had been 'delayed.'</p>

<p>The document was titled 'Russia Likely to Denigrate Health of US Candidates to Influence 2020 Election.' U.S. intelligence determined in 2017 that Russia's election interference campaign was directed by the Kremlin</p>

<p>Acting Department of Homeland (DHS) Security Secretary Chad Wolf joined President Trump on his trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin Tuesday</p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly attacked 'Sleepy Joe' Biden for his mental fitness. On Tuesday the president denied himself experiencing a 'series of mini-strokes'</p>

<p>'This particular draft product lacked the necessary context and evidence for broader dissemination outside of the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Intelligence and Analysis,' said the spokesperson, who said Wolf was briefed on the matter.</p>

<p>The leaked internal emails emerged as congressional Democrats are demanding the Trump administration resume in-person election security briefings for lawmakers. New Director of Intelligence former GOP Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist, wrote the intelligence committees to inform them they will only get election security briefings in writing. </p>

<p>The DNI warned last month that Russia was seeking to 'denigrate' Biden, without providing specifics. The DNI's statement also said that China prefers Biden in the election, without spelling out any concrete actions it was taking.</p>

<p>A Moscow plan to promote attacks on Biden's mental fitness would dovetail with many of the slashing personal attacks Trump has been making against his rival.</p>

<p>Trump tweeted March 2:  WOW! Sleepy Joe doesn’t know where he is, or what he’s doing. Honestly, I don’t think he even knows what office he's running for!'</p>

<p>Trump tweeted in May that his 'BRAIN is much sharper' than Biden's.</p>

<p>Trump regularly depicts Biden as controlled by others, and said Tuesday 'Biden doesn't know he's alive.'</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Trump used Twitter to deny that he himself 'suffered a series of mini-strokes' and had the White House physician release a statement denying he had had a stroke or other ailments involving the brain, after a new book revealed Vice President Mike Pence was put on standby during Trump's September 2019 trip to Walter Reed Medical Center.</p>

<p>Wolfe accompanied Trump to Kenosha Wisconsin Tuesday along with Attorney General Bill Barr.  </p>
