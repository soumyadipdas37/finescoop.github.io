<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lebanon was hit by yet another explosion today as a cloud of smoke erupted over a suspected Hezbollah arms depot.</p>

<p>Hezbollah operatives surrounded the blast site after a fire broke out in the village of Ain Qana, 30 miles south of Beirut which was devastated by last month's port explosion. </p>

<p>Security sources said the explosion was caused by a 'technical error' and had caused a number of injuries but Hezbollah officials have not confirmed any casualties. </p>

<p>The Iran-backed group is heavily armed but its political wing has been a major player in Lebanese governments in recent years.   </p>

<p>Hezbollah operatives surrounded the blast site after a fire broke out in the village of Ain Qana, 30 miles south of Beirut which was devastated by last month's port explosion</p>

<p>A witness near the village said they felt the ground shake while footage on Lebanese TV showed men walking over scorched ground littered with debris. </p>

<p>Damage was shown in an adjacent house where the floor was covered in glass and what appeared to be a pool of blood, with a fire still burning at the blast site.  </p>

<p>One Hezbollah official said the nature of the blast was not yet clear while a Lebanese security official said the explosion had happened at an arms depot. </p>

<p>Hezbollah and Israel fought a month-long war in 2006, since when the Iran-backed group is thought to have amassed tens of thousands of rockets and missiles.  </p>

<p>The Israeli military declined to comment on today's blast. </p>

<p>Last week the US ramped up the pressure on Europe to ban Hezbollah altogether by claiming that the group had stores of explosives in Greece, Italy and Spain. </p>

<p>The alleged stash of weapons included supplies of ammonium nitrate, the chemical blame for the disaster in Beirut. </p>

<p>But France, which is leading reconstruction efforts in Lebanon, said there was 'nothing tangible to confirm such an allegation'. </p>

<p>France is spearheading calls for reform after an explosion that was widely blamed on corruption and incompetence among Lebanon's ruling class. </p>

<p>The government resigned in the wake of the disaster, which killed nearly 200 people, injured 6,500 others and destroyed huge swathes of the port city. </p>

<p>A stash of ammonium nitrate that had been lying unsecured in a warehouse was blamed for the explosion although it is still not clear what caused it to ignite.  </p>

<p>The blast has plunged the country into its worst crisis since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war. </p>

<p>Beirut has since been hit by further fires, including one which damaged a landmark shopping centre designed by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid. </p>

<p>Today's explosion comes weeks after the disaster in Beirut on August 4 (pictured), when a stash of ammonium nitrate exploded and devastated huge swathes of the Lebanese capital </p>
