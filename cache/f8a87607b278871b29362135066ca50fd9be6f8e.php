<p>Since Roger and Leslie Gillespie opened the first store in Hawthorn, Victoria with their friend Gary Stephenson in 1980, Bakers Delight has woven itself into the fabric of Australian society. </p>

<p>Now ubiquitous on city streets and in shopping malls nationwide, the bakery started with humble creations including a white block loaf, cheese and bacon rolls and sweet finger buns.</p>

<p>The quintessentially Australian Cheesymite Scroll followed in 1994, when a hungry baker invented it during breakfast in a store kitchen.</p>

<p>By then, the brand had expanded nationally to open stores in Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. </p>

<p>More daring creations followed, with 'BBQ Bonanza Pizzas' and 'Jam Bunlets' appearing on shelves in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>Still owned by the Gillespie family, Bakers Delight is now Australia's most successful bakery franchise with over 700 locations across the country as well as New Zealand, Canada and the US.</p>
