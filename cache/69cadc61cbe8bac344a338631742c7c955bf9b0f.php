<p>Despite previously admitting that her famous parents would encourage her to lose weight in the past, the model, who is a size-18, dismisses the notion that they did anything wrong.</p>

<p>'I think people would very much like to spin it that my parents were forcing me to do a diet. Of course they weren’t. I hated myself. I hated my body,' she has admitted to The Sun. 'I could see that it broke their hearts to see their daughter so full of self-loathing.'</p>

<p>Proud: Honey Ross - the outspoken 23-year-old daughter of chat show host Jonathan and his wife Jane Goldman - has admitted she 'hated herself' long before she accepted her own body</p>

<p>She admits that being targeted by trolls online - being called 'a hog' by keyboard warriors - was what spurred her obsession with her weight, at the age of 12.</p>

<p>Being featured alongside her family online allowed such comments to be posted - with Honey reading them and as a result opting into Weight Watchers and requesting a personal trainer by age 14.</p>

<p>She did lose weight but felt 'more miserable' and affronted that people who had ignored her previously were suddenly being friendly.</p>

<p>'I was thin and very intimidating. People who had never given me a second glance were being so nice to me and flirting with me. And I was f**king furious,' she explained. 'It made me see everything really clearly. When you are a fat woman, sometimes you’re not even treated like a person.'</p>

<p>Not to blame: Despite previously admitting that her famous parents would encourage her to lose weight in the past, the model, who is a size-18, dismisses the notion that they did anything wrong</p>

<p>Defiant: She is sure to post snaps of herself across social media, often wearing very little. And she won't apologise for it</p>

<p>Hitting back: Honey slammed 'fatphobic' people sliding into her DMs</p>

<p>Positivity: Honey took to Instagram to encourage others on their journey of 'self-love and self-acceptance', and took a swipe at online trolls</p>

<p>She is sure to post snaps of herself across social media, often wearing very little. And she won't apologise for it.</p>

<p>'Because I’ve got a gut, apparently that’s a big deal. I am really attractive,' Honey said. 'I’m an attractive young woman who wants to enjoy my life and my body in the same way that my thin friends have always been allowed to.</p>

<p>'So yeah, I am going to post a bikini photo!'</p>

<p>This comes after Honey slammed 'fatphobic' people sliding into her DMs on social media to send her abusive DMs, sarcastically suggesting 'they want to f**k me'.</p>

<p>Fury: The star said trolls harassing her was because they 'wanna f**k me' in a sarcastic response as she hit back in a defiant post</p>

<p>Abuse: The star revealed someone who had left an abusive comment was now asking her out on a date </p>

<p>She wrote on Instagram:'I'm not even joking, someone in my comments saying I'm going to die of heart disease is in my DMs asking me out. You couldn't write it.</p>

<p>'For the overwhelmingly lovely DMs I've received - thank you so much and I wish you all the most beautiful journey of self love and self acceptance. Let today be the day you start being kind to yourself and your body.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'Truly there's only a handful of people being outwardly fatphobic. </p>

<p> Honey said: 'From a young age, I felt I didn’t have any control over my image'</p>

<p>She said: 'My advice to parents is keep that as far away from your children as possible, if you want them to have a good relationship with food and their bodies growing up do not shame them' (Jonathan and Jane pictured in 2017) </p>

<p>'And it really does not affect me in any meaningful or long lasting way - more like a momentary annoyance and an anger that what they've said would really hurt someone with less of a hardened shell than I have.</p>

<p>'Their choice to harass fat people says more about them than it does about me, a wholesome fat woman merely existing happily.'</p>

<p>The star finished with: 'Also TBH, I know it's because they wanna f**k me and are angry that's never gonna happen.' </p>
