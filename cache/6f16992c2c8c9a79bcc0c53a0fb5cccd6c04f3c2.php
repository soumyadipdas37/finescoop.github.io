<p>With her golden locks styled into a ponytail, the This Morning host highlighted her good looks with a fresh and light palette of makeup.</p>

<p>Her outing comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections.</p>

<p>Talking on Thursday's This Morning, she asked whether she was going to have to choose between her mother Lynne, 71, or father Terry, over the yuletide season, due to having a family of five.   </p>

<p>From Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'. </p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. </p>

<p>Holly has three children with husband Dan, meaning just one of her parents would make up the 'six person rule'. </p>

<p>Discussing the new restrictions with Matthew Wright on This Morning, the ITV star said: 'A lot of people are thinking, "What will this mean for Christmas? What will Christmas look like?"</p>

<p>New rules: Her outing comes after Holly lamented the new 'six person rule' as England prepares to face updated coronavirus restrictions on Monday following a spike in infections</p>

<p>'It's going to be very awkward in my house as I'm a family-of-five, so I'll have to choose between my mum and dad on Christmas day!'  </p>

<p>To which Matthew, 55, replied: 'I'm feeling very confused and conflicted. The rules are different everywhere else in the United Kingdom. </p>

<p>'You can't have your parents over on Christmas Day but you can go on public transport? For the life of me, I can't make any sense of it.'</p>

<p>With Holly adding: 'I guess the other thought is how is anyone going to police these rules. The government are going to have marshals to monitor people.'</p>
