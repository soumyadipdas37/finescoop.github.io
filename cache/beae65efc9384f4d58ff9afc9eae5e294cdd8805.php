<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A chunk of Greenland's largest remaining ice shelf - larger than the city of Paris - has broken off into the Arctic due to rapid climate change, according to scientists.</p>

<p>Researchers working for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) studied satellite images of the ice shelf taken over over the past three decades and say rising temperatures have led to increasing ice shelf disintegration.</p>

<p>An estimated 42.3 square miles chunk of of ice broke off off the fjord called Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden into the far north-east Arctic in each of the past two years. </p>

<p>Average temperatures in the region have increased by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit since 1980 - with record summer temperatures recorded in 2019 and 2020.</p>

<p>Greenpeace spokesperson, Laure Meller, described the findings as 'another alarm bell being rung by the climate crisis in a rapidly heating Arctic'. </p>

<p>Researchers working for the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) studied satellite images of the ice shelf taken over the past seven years. Left is the shelf in 2013 and right is the same shelf this year</p>

<p>This is an EU Copernicus Sentinel 2B satellite image from July 31, 2019 showing the pools and rivers of water (dark blue) on the surface of the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier</p>

<p>The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream extends 372 miles into the interior of the ice sheet - draining through Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden and Zachariae Glacier. </p>

<p>The Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden shelf, also known as 79N, is 50 miles long and 12 miles wide - it has shattered into many small pieces as a result of a warming climate.  </p>

<p>'We should be very concerned about what appears to be progressive disintegration at the Arctic's largest remaining ice shelf,' GEUS professor Jason Box said. </p>

<p>At the leading edge, 79N splits in two, with a minor offshoot turning north - it is this offshoot - called Spalte Glacier - that has since disintegrated.  </p>

<p>'If we see more warm summers like we observed the last two years, it will be contributing more to the accelerating global sea level rise,' Box said.</p>

<p>The melting of Greenland's ice sheet contributed to a sea level rise of 0.4 inches between 1992 and 2018, researchers claim.  </p>

<p>Dr. Niels J. Korsgaard, researcher at GEUS, said when an ice shelf is reduced or collapses it makes the glaciers thin and their collapse accelerate. </p>

<p>'When you observe large parts of an ice shelf breaking off you do raise an eyebrow, but with current developments in the Arctic there is also the realisation that this is to be expected,' said Korsgaard.</p>

<p>'Temperatures in the Arctic are rising faster than the global average. More heat is available from air and ocean to melt away the bottom and surface of ice shelves, and the thinning ice shelves are more susceptible to breaking up. </p>

<p>'We saw this with Zachariae Glacier, this summer with Milne Ice Shelf in Canada, and now Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier is losing parts of its ice shelf as well.' </p>

<p>Ruth Mottram, from the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen, said, 'again this year, the ice sheet has lost more ice than has been added in the form of snow.'</p>

<p>The red area in the optical satellite image shows the ice lost the past two years from the part of the Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden Glacier called Spalte Glacier that calves into Djimphna Sund</p>

<p>'If we had seen this meltdown 30 years ago, we would have called it extreme. So in recent years, we have become accustomed to a high meltdown.'</p>

<p>She said ice loss at levels once regarded as extreme and at the 'high end of worst case scenario predictions' are now becoming normal. </p>

<p>A study from August found that ice loss in Greenland during an extra-warm 2019 would have been enough to cover California in more than four feet of water. </p>

<p>Dr Anne Solgaard, from GEUS, was part of the team that used satellite images to determine that speed of disintegration of the ice shelf and related glaciers. </p>

<p>'Using almost 30 years of satellite data, we see speed up in the glacier flow over the past decade,' said Solgaard.</p>

<p>'It is not only near the current disintegration, but we measure acceleration upstream where the ice begins to float, indicating a large-scale change to this huge glacier.'</p>

<p>Global sea levels could rise as much as 10ft (3 metres) if the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica collapses. </p>

<p>Sea level rises threaten cities from Shanghai to London, to low-lying swathes of Florida or Bangladesh, and to entire nations such as the Maldives. </p>

<p>In the UK, for instance, a rise of 6.7ft (2 metres) or more may cause areas such as Hull, Peterborough, Portsmouth and parts of east London and the Thames Estuary at risk of becoming submerged.</p>

<p>The collapse of the glacier, which could begin with decades, could also submerge major cities such as New York and Sydney.</p>

<p>Parts of New Orleans, Houston and Miami in the south on the US would also be particularly hard hit.</p>

<p>A 2014 study looked by the union of concerned scientists looked at 52 sea level indicators in communities across the US.</p>

<p>It found tidal flooding will dramatically increase in many East and Gulf Coast locations, based on a conservative estimate of predicted sea level increases based on current data.</p>

<p>The results showed that most of these communities will experience a steep increase in the number and severity of tidal flooding events over the coming decades.</p>

<p>By 2030, more than half of the 52 communities studied are projected to experience, on average, at least 24 tidal floods per year in exposed areas, assuming moderate sea level rise projections. Twenty of these communities could see a tripling or more in tidal flooding events.</p>

<p>The mid-Atlantic coast is expected to see some of the greatest increases in flood frequency. Places such as Annapolis, Maryland and Washington, DC can expect more than 150 tidal floods a year, and several locations in New Jersey could see 80 tidal floods or more.</p>

<p>In the UK, a two metre (6.5 ft) rise by 2040 would see large parts of Kent almost completely submerged, according to the results of a paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science in November 2016.</p>

<p>Areas on the south coast like Portsmouth, as well as Cambridge and Peterborough would also be heavily affected.</p>

<p>Cities and towns around the Humber estuary, such as Hull, Scunthorpe and Grimsby would also experience intense flooding. </p>
