<p>They wrote in a joint statement: 'It is with deep sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved mother, Helen Reddy, on the afternoon of September 29, 2020, in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>'She was a wonderful mother, grandmother and a truly formidable woman. Our hearts are broken. But we take comfort in the knowledge that her voice will live on forever.'</p>

<p>Ups and downs: Wald, a 76-year-old producer, was married to Helen from 1966 until 1983, and their often tumultuous relationship was documented in this year's biopic I Am Woman. Pictured together at a television taping in New York City in November 1977</p>

<p>Since her dementia diagnosis in 2015, Helen had been living in a nursing home in LA for retired Hollywood talent.</p>

<p>Media commentator Peter Ford said on 6PR: 'She has been in not great health for several years now. You may be aware that dementia struck her about three years ago and she's been getting progressively worse.'</p>

<p>Helen was a pioneer behind the women's rights movement of the 1970s, and her death comes just months after the biopic I Am Woman depicted the many social changes her music inspired throughout her career. </p>

<p>Her hit song, I Am Woman, became an anthem for the movement, but success didn't come easy for Helen, who had to convince record executives of its value. </p>

<p>She also had to fight for fair pay, after learning her all-male band was earning more money than she was. </p>

<p>The biopic has as its centerpiece Helen's famous Grammy Awards acceptance speech after she won Best Female Pop Vocal.</p>

<p>'I'd like to thank God, because she makes everything possible,' she memorably said.</p>

<p>The director of I Am Woman, Unjoo Moon, said after Reddy's death: 'When I first met Helen Reddy, she told me that I would be in her life for many years. </p>

<p>'What followed was an amazing seven-year friendship during which she entrusted me with telling her story in a film that celebrates her life, her talents and her amazing legacy.</p>

<p>'I will forever be grateful to Helen for teaching me so much about being an artist, a woman and a mother. </p>

<p>'She paved the way for so many and the lyrics that she wrote for I Am Woman changed my life forever like they have done for so many other people and will continue to do for generations to come.' </p>

<p>Moon continued: 'She will always be a part of me and I will miss her enormously. On behalf of all of us involved in making the film I am Woman, producer Rosemary Blight and I extend our condolences to Helen's family especially her children Traci and Jordan, her granddaughter Lily and her ex-husband Jeff.'  </p>

<p>Fighting for her rights: Her hit song, I Am Woman, became an anthem for the feminist rights movement, but success didn't come easy for Helen, who had to convince record executives of its value. Pictured in 1970</p>

<p>Back in 2005, Helen said she wasn't afraid of dying in an interview with Australian broadcaster Margaret Throsby.</p>

<p>'I see dying as going home... where we came from,' she said. 'Where we all go back to. I've seen enough of the other side to know that that is our true home. That is where we are loved beyond anything we can imagine here.'  </p>

<p>I Am Woman is currently streaming on Stan</p>
