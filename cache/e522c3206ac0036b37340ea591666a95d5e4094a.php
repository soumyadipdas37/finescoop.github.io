<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Erik Lamela left fans scratching their heads as he took to the pitch in two different boots against Chelsea on Tuesday - only to reveal it is because adidas' specially-made boot is yet to arrive.</p>

<p>The Argentine produced a major contribution in the Carabao Cup win with the equalising goal to force a penalty shootout, which Tottenham won. </p>

<p>But it was his fashion choices that caused a stir online and Lamela had to put the record straight after the win as to why he was showing off an eight-year old boot on his right foot.</p>

<p>Erik Lamela caused a stir by wearing two completely different boots against Chelsea</p>

<p>On his right foot he wore the 2012 Adizero f50 and on his left he wore the 2019 Copa 19.1</p>

<p>'No, it is not superstition,' he told Sky Sports. 'I have a problem in my right foot and they are making a new boot. </p>

<p>'Adidas are making a new boot and it should arrive tomorrow.' </p>

<p>The Tottenham winger sported the 2012 Adizero f50 boot on his right foot while opting for the 2019 adidas Copa 19.1 in blue on his left. </p>

<p>The 2012 pair is difficult to get hold of but owners have sold them for a price in the region of £150. The 2019 adidas Copa 19.1 come in somewhere around £100. </p>

<p>He later explained that a 'problem' with his right foot saw him have to improvise with his boots</p>

<p>Boots are often a statement by players with so many unique designs and combination of colours.</p>

<p>But rarely do players take to the pitch in completely different shoes on each foot and eyes will be fixed to what Lamela has on his feet should he take to the field on Thursday for Tottenham's Europa League qualifier against Maccabi Haifa. </p>

<p>In the end the old boots did no harm to Lamela's prospects in the third round tie as he slotted home with seven minutes remaining to stun Chelsea.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho's side went on to win 5-4 in the penalty shootout after Mason Mount missed the decisive kick.</p>

<p>Lamela was Tottenham's second penalty taker and scored into the bottom corner. The draw for the quarter-finals in the Carabao Cup is made on Thursday.  </p>

<p>Adidas are said to be making a special boot but it had not arrived in time to take on Chelsea</p>
