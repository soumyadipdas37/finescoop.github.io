<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>On the night, the rousing strains of Rule, Britannia! echoed around an empty Royal Albert Hall after a battle that saw patriotism triumph over 'woke' political correctness. </p>

<p>The BBC caved in to public pressure over the Last Night of the Proms and the pared-down concert did little to dent the enthusiasm of millions of viewers at home. </p>

<p>Covid laws meant there were no Promenaders to enthusiastically wave their Union Jacks to the familiar melodies, including Land Of Hope And Glory. </p>

<p>The BBC caved in to public pressure over the Last Night of the Proms and the pared-down concert did little to dent the enthusiasm of millions of viewers at home</p>

<p>Instead, soprano Golda Schultz last night belted out a handful of the iconic tunes alongside 44 socially-distanced members of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Finnish star Dalia Stasevska. </p>

<p>But traditionalists were aghast at a radical reworking of Proms classic Jerusalem by Belize-born British composer Errollyn Wallen that fused elements of blues and African music with the original tune . </p>

<p>Perhaps anticipating the backlash – with Twitter users accusing the BBC of 'trashing' and 'murdering' the hymn – host Katie Derham assured viewers that the traditional version would be played later. </p>

<p>Violinist Nicola Benedetti (pictured) played Vaughan Williams' The Lark Ascending, which was intercut with idyllic scenes of the British countryside</p>

<p>Ms Wallen, 62, had previously said her version would be dedicated to the Windrush generation and yesterday admitted it was 'radically different', suggesting that sometimes traditions should change. </p>

<p>But she insisted on Radio 4's Today programme that she was trying to 'get closer to what I feel is the original meaning of [William] Blake's text – very searching and asking questions'. </p>

<p>Also presenting were actress Adjoa Andoh and broadcaster Richard Coles who said: 'It is so moving to hear live music again. It's like water in the desert.' </p>

<p>Corporation bosses had originally planned to include only instrumental versions of the nation's historic songs amid claims their lyrics were racist and celebrated colonialism and slavery. </p>

<p>STAYING OUT: Anti-EU protesters gathered outside the Royal Albert Hall</p>

<p>But it was forced into a U-turn after pressure from musicians, MPs and an outraged public. </p>

<p>Despite the volte-face, the Corporation broke with tradition and rather than Ms Schultz singing Rule, Britannia!, it was performed from the stalls by 18 BBC singers – the first time a chorus has sung the stirring number since 2007. </p>

<p>The 36-year-old South African soprano also sang You'll Never Walk Alone, and last-minute replacement violinist Nicola Benedetti played Vaughan Williams' The Lark Ascending, which was intercut with idyllic scenes of the British countryside. </p>

<p>Before the event, the BBC said they were doing 'everything possible to make it special' adding: 'We think the night itself will be a very special moment for the country – and one that is much needed after a difficult period for everyone.' </p>

<p>Critics said the BBC appeared to have hit the right note. Composer Debbie Wiseman told The Mail on Sunday: 'It's a well-chosen programme and everything seemed to work well. </p>

<p>'Of course it was never going to be exactly the same as in previous years, but the acoustics in the room meant an orchestra of 44 musicians sounded more like 80.' </p>
