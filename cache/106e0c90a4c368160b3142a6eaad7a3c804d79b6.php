<p>Currently, people can only store their eggs or sperm for a decade, after which they must either go through with fertility treatment or destroy them.</p>

<p>Nuffield Council on Bioethics said there is no good reason not to extend the freezing time and claim the arbitrary 10-year limit puts pressure on people to have a baby they are not ready for.  </p>

<p>It claimed some private fertility services in the UK have preyed on anxious women through Prosecco-fuelled marketing events and targeted online adverts. </p>

<p>The Government has been assessing the rule since February, although its not clear when a decision will be made either way. </p>

<p>Experts have raised concerns that some women are being forced to travel abroad and use substandard healthcare to get around the 10-year rule. </p>

<p>The NHS only funds egg freezing for medical reasons - in advance of cancer treatment, for example. People who get the procedure on the health service can apply to have them stored for up to 55 years.</p>

<p>But people who do it for social reasons need to go private and pay around £8,000 on average.  </p>

<p>Egg freezing dates back to 1986 when the first pregnancy from a frozen egg was reported in the Lancet Journal. </p>

<p>Collected eggs were preserved in cryogenic tanks after being frozen 'slowly' for many years. </p>

<p>In the early 2000s, scientists began experimenting with an 'ultra-rapid' freezing technique called vitrification. </p>

<p>Using this process, the temperature of an egg plummets thousands of degrees per minute, resulting in a glass-like cell structure that is stronger than other crystalline ice forms. </p>

<p>They are then stored in cryogenic tanks, for up to 25 years. </p>

<p>In preparation for having her eggs retrieved, a woman must undergo the first stage of an IVF cycle, which uses hormones to stimulate more eggs into maturity, then another set of hormones to trigger the eggs' release. </p>

<p>Patients inject these drugs at home and are usually closely monitored by their doctors.  </p>

<p>There are many different forms of these hormone treatments, ranging in cost from about $800 (£625) to $6,000 (£4,675) per cycle, and six to 10 weeks in duration.</p>

<p>Then, the eggs are surgically retrieved in a minimally-invasive procedure.  </p>

<p>Dr John Appleby, lecturer in medical ethics at Lancaster University, said: 'The UK's 10-year egg freezing rule for social egg freezing is not fit for purpose and this briefing highlights how we have very little reason for maintaining it any longer.'</p>

<p>Sarah Norcross, from the assisted conception debate group Progress Educational Trust, said: 'With more women than ever choosing to freeze their eggs, it is time for the law to be changed.'</p>

<p>Frances Flinter, Nuffield Council member and emeritus professor of clinical genetics at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'It's vital for women thinking about freezing their eggs to be able to make informed choices.</p>

<p>'To do this, they need easy access to data on their chances of success across various stages of the process - from freezing and thawing eggs, to having a live birth. But they also need clinics to be frank about the process, and about what is known and unknown about egg freezing.'</p>

<p>There has also been a rise in companies offering to pay for women to freeze their eggs which is 'concerncing', Nuffield said.  </p>

<p>While it may work as a 'gender equaliser' in some cases and boost women's salaries, it could also pressure women to delay parenthood to show commitment to the company, it warned.   </p>

<p>Women who have IVF after freezing their eggs have about a one in five chance of conceiving after the procedure, according to latest estimates. </p>

<p>The Newcastle Fertility Centre, behind the study, analysed all IVF births going back 15 years using data from the UK's fertility regulator.</p>

<p>IVF births in the mid-2000s skew the success rate (18 per cent) because techniques have vastly improved since then.</p>

<p>But experts say the finding should serve as a warning to women that the procedure could take five attempts before working.  </p>

<p>The vast majority who go through the procedure do so in their late 30s – by which time they have very little chance of success.</p>

<p>Specialists fear fertility clinics encourage women to delay motherhood for too long, by offering them the safety net of egg freezing. </p>

<p>Figures show two-thirds of women who freeze their eggs in Britain do not do so until they are over the age of 35.  </p>
