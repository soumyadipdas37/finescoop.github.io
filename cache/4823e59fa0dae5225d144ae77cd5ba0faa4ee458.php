<p>Friends of McNutt spoke of their sorrow last week after the Mississippian streamed his tragic death.</p>

<p>One wrote online: 'Please say a prayer right now for the family of Ronnie McNutt. He just killed himself live on Facebook and I cannot unsee this.</p>

<p>'I tried but apparently it wasn't quick enough to reach him. I wasn't quick enough.</p>

<p>'Dear God, I wish I could have got to him.'</p>

<p>Since then the social media sites have been trying to take the footage down as those who have witnessed it urge others to avoid TikTok.</p>

<p>One wrote on Twitter: 'If you see this guy on your For You page, please scroll up immediately.</p>

<p>'It's very gruesome and I highly suggest you stay away from TikTok for a while.'</p>

<p>McNutt was an Iraq War veteran who worked for Toyota in Blue Spring, New Albany</p>

<p>A TikTok spokesman said: 'On Sunday night, clips of a suicide that had been livestreamed on Facebook circulated on other platforms, including TikTok.</p>

<p>'Our systems have been automatically detecting and flagging these clips for violating our policies against content that displays, praises, glorifies, or promotes suicide.</p>

<p>'We are banning accounts that repeatedly try to upload clips, and we appreciate our community members who've reported content and warned others against watching, engaging, or sharing such videos on any platform out of respect for the person and their family.</p>

<p>'If anyone in our community is struggling with thoughts of suicide or concerned about someone who is, we encourage them to seek support, and we provide access to hotlines directly from our app and in our Safety Centre.'</p>

<p>Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p>

<p>McNutt, who worked for Toyota in Blue Spring, New Albany, was a member of the Celebration Church Tupelo and they confirmed his death on September 1.</p>

<p>There were reports that he'd recently lost his job and broken up with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>'In the midst of a sudden tragedy that occurred last night, we grieve with the McNutt Family during this time because passing of our brother in Christ, Ronnie McNutt,' the church said on Facebook.</p>

<p>'Ronnie will be missed by all who loved and knew him.</p>

<p>'He was very caring, committed, loyal, dependable, and eccentric. He served his church faithfully and was loved by many. </p>

<p>Posts have appeared warning users to stay away from TikTok due to the viral footage of McNutt</p>

<p>'Although events surrounding his death were tragic, we take comfort in our Creator, believing that because of Ronnie's confession and conversion as a believer in Christ Jesus, he is currently before our loving Father.'  </p>

<p>TikTok, whose China-based owner Bytedance has been ordered by President Donald Trump to sell its U.S. operations, has been criticised for its content moderation policy in the past, especially on circulation of graphic content.</p>

<p>The company rolled out a new content moderation infrastructure in December under which it labeled the videos that were removed by the company with the policy category they violated, it said in its transparency report published in July.</p>
