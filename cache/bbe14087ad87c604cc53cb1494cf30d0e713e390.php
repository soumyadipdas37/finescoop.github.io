<p>On Twitter she said: 'My daughter is 1 years old and got hit &amp; dragged by a cyclist in our local park. The woman drove off and wouldn't comply with giving me her details. 'Not even a sorry!! My daughter was taken by an ambulance!'</p>

<p>She told Sun Online: 'The cyclist came flying out of the gate and her front wheel hit my daughter in the face.</p>

<p>'It was awful. I was screaming and shouting 'you have just run over my daughter'.'</p>

<p>A video has emerged of the aftermath of alleged collision showing the female cyclist accused of hitting the young child in a confrontation between a member of the public. </p>

<p>Distraught Victoria Grant posted pictures on social media showing marks on her daughter's face (pictured)</p>

<p>At the start of the man filming is heard saying:  'You have knocked over a child and now you are moving away from the scene of an accident. </p>

<p>'I am informing you in a car, or on a bicycle or on a scooter, if you strike a pedestrian you are duty bound to report it.'</p>

<p>The female cyclist, wearing pink leggings and a grey top, shouts that she is 'standing here and not going. I haven't got a f****** phone, you're driving me nuts.'</p>

<p>The man filming begins arguing with another pedestrian saying she is 'trying to do the right thing' by phoning the police.</p>

<p>The man filming continues to say the female cyclist needs to report the incident, and she repeatedly asks him to 'leave her alone.' </p>

<p>The incident between the cyclist, pedestrian and man filming then escalates and the female biker says she is going to 'sue him.'</p>

<p>She says: 'I have not given you permission to tape me so you take that off please.'</p>

<p>The cyclist then takes a picture of the man filming and calls him a 'stalker' and a 'proper weirdo.' </p>

<p>The man filming and female cyclist continue to argue.</p>

<p>A man claiming to be an off-duty police officer then comes into shot, and starts talking to the female cyclist who says the 'kid comes in the middle of my path, I don't even see the kid.'</p>

<p>The officer then turns to the man filming and says the incident is not necessarily a criminal matter. He disagrees and says hitting a child is a criminal matter.</p>

<p>The video ends shortly afterwards. </p>
