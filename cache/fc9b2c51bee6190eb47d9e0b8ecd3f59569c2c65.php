<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>J.P. Morgan's stock market guru has told investors to be ready for a Donald Trump win in November as his betting odds dramatically narrowed against Joe Biden. </p>

<p>Marko Kolanovic, a top analyst at the bank, said in a note to clients Monday that most investors are positioned for a Biden win, after he established a clear lead in the polls.</p>

<p>But he warned that liberal 'cancel culture' may be keeping Trump voters from speaking to pollsters, while protest violence could badly damage Biden's numbers.</p>

<p>Investors should prepare for a Donald Trump victory in November, a top analyst at J.P. Morgan has said, pointing to betting odds which show the pair neck-and-neck as proof (pictured)</p>

<p>Marko Kolanovic, who correctly called where the bottom of the market would fall amid coronavirus, predicted that 'liberal cancel culture' and protest violence will hurt Biden</p>

<p>Kolanovic pointed to betting odds - which have Biden and Trump neck-and-neck - as evidence that a so-called 'silent majority' could steer the Republican to victory.</p>

<p>Biden is currently leading Trump by six points in most nationwide polling, though Kolanovic warned that could be misleading.  </p>

<p>Kolanovic said he expects Trump to receive a five to six per cent boost from people who were afraid or unwilling to declare their support for him in polls.</p>

<p>On top of which, Kolanovic said Trump could receive a further boost if public opinion swings against Democrats over protests that are gripping the US.</p>

<p>Research carried out between 1960 to 1972 showed that, amid peaceful pro-Democratic protests, the party receives a three per cent bump in voters.</p>

<p>But if those protests are perceived to be violent, then Republicans receive a boost of up to eight per cent, Kolanovic said in a note seen by Bloomberg.</p>

<p>Predicting that Republicans could get up to 10 per cent support from this year's protests, Kolanovic said that was down to 'the broad online availability of violent footage, but also the ability to influence social media to amplify this message.'</p>

<p>Biden has a six-point lead over Trump in national polling, but Kolanovic said that is misleading - and could be turned on its head when voters head to the ballot boxes in November</p>

<p>Trump has made 'law and order' the centerpiece of his campaign, visiting the town of Kenosha on Tuesday to examine damage caused by days of rioting there</p>

<p>Kolanovic is a highly-respected Wall Street analyst, who correctly predicted the US stock market would bottom out in March before rebounding.</p>

<p>Even as the market soared in July he continued to predict growth, before the S&amp;P and Dow both registered their best August month since the 1980s </p>

<p>Meanwhile Donald Trump has made 'law and order' the central theme of his campaign, traveling to Kenosha in Wisconsin on Tuesday to examine damage caused by rioting in the wake of the police shooting of an unarmed black man in the city.</p>

<p>Trump Jr also told Fox News that 'Biden voters' are responsible for burning and looting across America, while condemning the Democrat for not denouncing the violence sooner.</p>

<p>In a speech on Monday, Biden condemned violence from both 'left and right' and urged Trump to do the same.</p>
