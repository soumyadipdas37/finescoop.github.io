<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The BBC is under fire over plans to spend up to £1million of taxpayers' cash setting up staff surveys.</p>

<p>In a move likely to anger the 3.7million over-75s stripped of their free licence fees, the corporation has earmarked the sum to get feedback on 'culture and engagement'.</p>

<p>The price of the software for 'staff surveys, exit surveys and regular pulse surveys' could pay for 6,300 licence fees at a cost of £157.50 each. </p>

<p>In a move likely to anger the 3.7million over-75s stripped of their free licence fees, the corporation has earmarked the sum to get feedback on 'culture and engagement'</p>

<p>The broadcaster billed the move as a way to 'deliver one of the key objectives of making the BBC an even greater place to work'.</p>

<p>Last night MPs and campaigners branded the contract a 'colossal waste of money' and urged the BBC to 'sort its priorities out'.</p>

<p>The plans were posted on the corporation's sourcing website days before Tim Davie took over as the new director-general.</p>

<p>The procurement document read: 'The BBC is looking to purchase a staff survey and engagement software-based platform solution.' </p>

<p>It added that collecting such data is 'critical in ensuring we can respond to the areas people are telling us we need to improve on'.</p>

<p>The contract is for three years - with the possibility of extending to five. The £1million fee would be spread across the five years. </p>

<p>It comes as Downing Street piled pressure on Mr Davie to 'look again' at the decision to axe universal free TV licences for the over-75s. </p>

<p>The BBC paid for 3.7million older people to receive free licences from 2015 when a new financing deal was brokered by the Government. </p>

<p>But the corporation claims it can no longer afford the £750million annual cost. </p>

<p>As of August 1, most over-75s will have to pay, though those receiving pension credit are exempt.</p>

<p>Tom Hunt, MP for Ipswich, said: 'I don't know how surveys can cost that much money. The BBC doesn't seem to be making every effort to minimise cost.'</p>

<p>Dennis Reed, director of campaign group Silver Voices, said the news would only anger over-75s 'militant' about fighting the licence fee. </p>

<p>He said: 'The BBC needs to sort its priorities out.'</p>

<p>A BBC spokesman said: 'Like most large organisations we use staff surveys to gain valuable feedback on our performance and respond to the areas people are telling us we need to improve on.'</p>

<p>The BBC will be forced to find a unique funding method as the licence fee model will not survive in the long term, a former boss has claimed.</p>

<p>Greg Dyke said he does not see a blanket £157.50 charge being around in the future.</p>

<p>The 73-year-old, who was director-general from 2000 to 2004, suggested a subscription service could work instead but said it would take away from the BBC’s ‘universality’.</p>

<p>‘It’s very difficult to find another way to adequately fund the BBC,’ he told Radio 4’s The World This Weekend. </p>

<p>‘But personally I doubt whether it [the licence fee] survives very long-term, no.’</p>

<p>Asked about an alternative, Dyke said: ‘Subscription of certain services is always a possibility.’</p>
