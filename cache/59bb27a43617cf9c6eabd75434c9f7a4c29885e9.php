<p>Supermarket giant Sainsbury's says it has seen a jump in customers searching for frozen turkeys and Christmas trees as Britons, weary from six months of social restrictions, yearn for the big event</p>

<p>Mr Blunt, who oversees £6.3 billion sales at Sainsbury's and its Argos subsidiary, said: 'Historically… as soon as Halloween is over, Christmas spikes.</p>

<p>'But this year we've seen it come forward all the way and, in terms of interest online and what people are beginning to search for, we've got the increase in Halloween and Christmas happening at the same time.'</p>

<p>He said the retailer had 'pulled forward some of our plans' in response, including launching a limited first wave of Christmas products two weeks early.</p>
