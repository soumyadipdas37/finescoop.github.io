<p>A $27 acne treatment has been crowned the best in Australia by thousands of women who say it's a 'miracle life-saving' product </p>

<p>The popular product is vegan, sulphate-free and uses a rich blend of ingredients to fight against acne - including sulfur, zinc oxide and isopropyl alcohol.  </p>

<p>Only a small amount of the solution is needed to clear the skin, and Mecca encourages customers to apply the solution to the surface of the blemish using a cotton bud.</p>

<p>'There's a reason why the Drying Lotion has been a medicine cabinet staple for over 50 years: it's the original bi-phase, on-the-spot solution that targets surface blemishes while you sleep,' a Mario Badescu team member said online. </p>

<p>'I have been using it on my skin for three days and all my blemishes have almost completely vanished! Nothing seems to work with my skin and I was so amazed at the results from this product!' one happy customer said on the Mecca website.</p>

<p>'Perfect product for my teenage daughters skin to clear up or reduce spots!!' another said.</p>

<p>'This is a must have for any girl that gets any pimple - pop it on at the end of your night time routine,' a third added.</p>
