<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mother of two of the Thunder River Rapids ride victims has revealed the chilling words that will haunt her 'until the day she dies'. </p>

<p>Kim Dorsett's children Kate Goodchild and Luke Dorsett, his partner Roozi Araghi, and NSW mother Cindy Low were killed when the amusement park ride malfunctioned, October 25, 2016. </p>

<p>Dreamworld's parent company Ardent Leisure faces up to $4.5 million in fines after pleading guilty to safety charges over the Thunder River Rapids ride tragedy. </p>

<p>Kim Dorsett, mother of Kate Goodchild and Luke Dorsett, arrives to the Southport Magistrates Court on the Gold Coast on September 28</p>

<p>Kate Goodchild (pictured left) and Luke Dorsett (right) were among those who died in the Dream World tragedy</p>

<p>Ms Dorsett and her granddaughter Ebony Turner who survived the tragedy appeared in Southport Magistrates Court on Monday for the sentencing hearing. </p>

<p>In a victim impact statement, the grieving mother said she will never be able to forget her granddaughter's anguish.</p>

<p>'(She said) 'I can’t find Mummy', words that will be with me until I take my last breath,' she said, the Courier Mail reports.  </p>

<p>Ms Dorsett said she has never felt so alone since losing her two children and cries everyday. </p>

<p>She told the court of the heartbreaking moment she last saw them. </p>

<p>'Kissing them one last time, they were as cold as ice,' she said. </p>

<p>'I just wanted to wrap them in a blanket.'</p>

<p>The tragedy unfolded when a water pump malfunctioned causing water levels in the ride to fall dangerously low.</p>

<p>The victims' raft collided with another after becoming stuck in the low water.</p>

<p>The gruesome scene at Dreamworld's Thunder River Rapids ride is pictured in 2016 following the tragedy</p>

<p>It partially flipped, flinging the group into the mechanised conveyor that moved the rafts. </p>

<p>The malfunction was the third that day and the fifth in a week, and no automated shutdown function was installed despite recommendations. </p>

<p>Ebony and Ms Low's son Kieran were in the raft during the horrific accident that killed their mothers. At the time, Ebony was just 12. </p>

<p>Outside court Ms Dorsett said it would be a difficult day.</p>

<p>'Absolutely (it will be difficult) just as it is every day,' Ms Dorsett said.</p>

<p>Other family members of the victims are watching the sentence electronically. </p>

<p>Workplace Health and Safety said Ardent Leisure failed to provide and maintain safe plant and structures and systems of work at the Gold Coast theme park.</p>

<p>Dreamworld's parent company Ardent Leisure faces up to $4.5 million in fines after pleading guilty to safety charges over the Thunder River Rapids ride tragedy.</p>

<p>The company also failed to provide information, training, instruction or supervision necessary to protect people from risk.</p>

<p>In February, Coroner James McDougall referred Ardent Leisure to the Office of Industrial Relations, saying there was a 'systemic failure' at Dreamworld in all aspects of safety.</p>

<p>The inquest also found there had been no thorough engineering risk assessment of the Thunder River Rapids in the 30 years it was open to the public.</p>

<p>Dreamworld presented itself as a modern, world-class theme park, but its 'frighteningly unsophisticated' safety procedures were 'rudimentary at best', he said while delivering the inquest findings.</p>
