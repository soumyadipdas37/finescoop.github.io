<p>Police have 'examined a millionaire's speedboat' as they probe the death of a British woman who was hit by a propeller while swimming off the coast of Corfu.</p>

<p>Hedge fund manager Rob Lucas, 58, his son, 18, and daughter, 22, were questioned as possible witnesses by officers after Claire Glatman died on Monday.</p>

<p>Mrs Glatman, 60, the wife of multimillionaire property tycoon Mark, was killed when she was hit by a vessel while in the sea off Avlaki beach.</p>

<p>Her body was pulled from the water shortly before 10am, taken to Corfu General Hospital and identified by her family's lawyer yesterday.</p>

<p>The speedboat thought to have been involved - not Mr Lucas's - was found abandoned at a nearby beach and moved to a local marina for forensic investigation.</p>

<p>Mr Lucas and his children, who reportedly own a house on Corfu, had their rib-style boat inspected by police.</p>

<p>Another vessel, which is believed to belong to a local who had claimed they tried to rescue Mrs Glatman, was also examined.</p>

<p>But officers say they still need to look at other boats that were in the area when the tragedy happened and speak to their owners.</p>

<p>Mrs Glatman, 60, the wife of multimillionaire property tycoon Mark (pictured together), was killed when she was hit by the vessel while in the sea off Avlaki beach</p>

<p>The speedboat thought to have been involved in the incident (pictured) was found abandoned at a nearby beach and was moved to a local marina for forensic investigation</p>

<p>Sources claimed to the Sun the Lucas family had been with their vessel in another part of Corfu at the time and are not involved.</p>

<p>The trio, who have a £5million house in Hertfordshire, were also said not to be part of police inquiries and had helped officers as potential witnesses.</p>

<p>Mrs Glatman, from Bedale, North Yorkshire, was on holiday with her husband, 63, and the eldest of her two daughters. She also has two sons.</p>

<p>Coroner Ioannis Aivatidis said Mrs Glatman had injuries to her left wrist, arm, chest, pelvis and upper right leg, leading to internal and external haemorrhaging.</p>

<p>Aivatidis added Mrs Glatman was hit hard by the speedboat and died after just a few moments.</p>

<p>He said the wounds were so severe no attempt to resuscitate her would have worked had someone managed to get her out of the water.</p>

<p>A locator map shows where Mrs Glatman sustained her fatal injuries at Avlaki Beach and where the speedboat suspected to have hit into her was later found  at Agios Stefanos Beach</p>

<p>Pictured is a file photograph of Avlaki Beach, which was where Mrs Glatman tragically died on Monday</p>

<p>She was described as a resident of Corfu for most of the year who was 'very popular in the local community', according to public broadcaster ERT. </p>

<p>Mrs Glatman is said to have fallen in love with Mr Glatman on the island 30 years ago and the couple purchased a villa more recently, the Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>A friend who chose to remain anonymous told the newspaper Mrs Glatman was an experienced swimmer.</p>

<p>Mrs Glatman swam at the spot every day while on the island, Corfu Press reported, citing friends of the family.</p>

<p>Villagers in Mrs Glatman's home village of Well, where they lived in the historic Well Hall, were shocked at the death of the 'beautiful soul'.</p>

<p>A neighbour said: 'It is dreadful news. She loved Corfu and they spent a lot of time there, but she was also a popular person around Well.'</p>

<p>They added: 'I knew her as a beautiful soul, friendly and very young at heart.'</p>

<p>Another villager said: 'We have had a scarecrow festival this weekend gone and the whole village came together and we had a fantastic time, but this has really brought us back down to earth. </p>

<p>Port authorities discovered an abandoned speedboat at the nearby beach. Pictured: A Greek coastguard vessel</p>

<p>'What a horrible thing to happen. My thoughts are with Mark and the rest of the family.'</p>

<p>The couple's house was an extensive walled property, has a swimming pool and tennis courts.</p>

<p>They also owned a £3million townhouse in London's Knightsbridge as well as the villa in Corfu.</p>

<p>A coastguard spokesman said: 'We received an emergency call by local swimmers who found the woman's body floating in the sea.</p>

<p>'The coastguard recovered the body and transferred it to the local state hospital where an autopsy will be performed to determine the exact cause of her death.'</p>

<p>A Foreign Office spokesman added: 'We are in contact with the local authorities following reports that a British woman has died in Corfu.'</p>

<p>Mrs Glatman, née Glover, was born in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, and her husband was a solicitor who became an influential commercial property developer.</p>

<p>He set up the Abstract group of companies in 2000, focusing on property development and investment and venture capital projects.</p>

<p>The net worth of his businesses is more than £83million.</p>
