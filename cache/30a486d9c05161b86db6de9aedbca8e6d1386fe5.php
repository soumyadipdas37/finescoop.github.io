<p>Wow factor: The Selling Sunset, 31, flaunted her ample cleavage and toned abs in the striking tiger print two-piece</p>

<p>Stunning: Christine showcased her incredible physique in the skimpy swimwear as she headed for a swim in the idyllic sea</p>

<p>The blonde beauty told Vogue: 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia. </p>

<p>'People think that [things are] real, and it's not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up. How I look on Selling Sunset is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>'The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two-and-a-half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either – $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap.'</p>

<p>Christine went on to say in season one she wasn't doing as well financially so used to buy designer clothes and then return them after filming.</p>

<p>This comes just after Quinn told The Sunday Times that she has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on Selling Sunset. </p>

<p>The siren said: 'People that don't know me say hurtful things. I'm just like, "Ugh, whatever." I don't know these people. </p>

<p>'But when I hear stuff from other people… That's upsetting. Sometimes, it hurts my feelings. Sometimes, it makes me cry.'</p>

<p>Although she's as vulnerable as the next person, Christine clarified she has no intention of toning down her villainous persona.</p>

<p>Quinn said: 'That's what people love about me. But obviously there are different sides to me. On the show, it's one note. But I'm a multifaceted villain.'</p>
