<p>'I never did anything mean to any of the women, beyond spilling the beans on the "dog c***t" saga. I never spoke of any other woman to Matt [Agnew], I never said anything insulting to any of the women and I certainly didn't make any of them feel the way that I felt. Yet somehow, I was the villain,' she wrote in an article for Whimn. </p>
