<p>The primates have roamed freely into the city of Songkhla, meeting little resistance due to the coronavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, a team of wildlife conservationists rounded up the imperious imps, drawing them into cages with bait before knocking them unconscious with tranquilizers.</p>

<p>The captured monkeys were marked with numbers so that they can be easily identified in future before being castrated.</p>

<p>Thung Tale Wildlife Conservation officer Suwat Suksiri said: 'We had to have monkeys neutered because the residents said the more wild monkey population means the more problems and conflicts could happen between them.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year hundreds of the monkeys were sterilised in the central city of Lopburi after their numbers spiralled wildly out of control.</p>

<p>Officials there were seeking to neuter around 500 of the 6,000 animals after they terrorised locals as they engaged in mass street brawls over scraps of food and invaded shops.  </p>

<p>Incredible footage showed the animals brawling over scraps of food in the street in Lopburi in March as a lack of tourists deprived them of their usual food supplies</p>

<p>People had sought to appease them with junk food, but the sugary diet turned them sex-crazed and they were breeding faster than ever.  </p>

<p>Footage of hundreds of them brawling over food in the streets went viral on social media in March.</p>

<p>Their growing numbers - doubling in three years - have made an uneasy coexistence with their human peers almost intolerable.</p>

<p>Many areas have simply been surrendered to the marauding monkeys. </p>
