<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disgruntled shoppers have taken a swipe at Woolworths for ending its hugely popular Disney+ Ooshies promotion nearly four weeks early.</p>

<p>The supermarket chain confirmed on Monday that Ooshie stocks will be completely depleted by the weekend due to 'extraordinary demand'.</p>

<p>Availability of the collectables varies from store-to-store around Australia, while online redemption of Ooshies has since been ceased everywhere other than Victoria after the launch was delayed across the state due to Stage Four restrictions.</p>

<p>Following the announcement, dozens of furious customers around the country reported on Facebook they can no longer redeem the figurines, with some even vowing to never shop at the supermarket again. </p>

<p>'What was the point in doing Ooshies when you don't have enough? You should have known it would be huge after The Lion King. You have left hundreds of young kids upset and their parents too. I will never ever shop in your store again,' one mum said.</p>

<p>Disgruntled shoppers have taken a swipe at Woolworths for ending its hugely popular Disney+ Ooshies promotion nearly four weeks early</p>

<p>Dozens of furious customers around the country reported on Facebook they can no longer redeem the figurines, with some even vowing to never shop at the supermarket again</p>

<p>In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a Woolworths spokesman said: 'Our Disney+ Ooshies have proven extraordinarily popular with customers, to the point we had to conclude the program early due to customers collecting the last of our stock.</p>

<p>'These collectibles take more than 12 months to plan and the quantity produced is based on our experience of running many collectible campaigns that we've previously offered.</p>

<p>'We attribute much of the success of our Disney+ Ooshies to customers of all ages connecting with the Disney+ universes, across Marvel, Star Wars, Disney, and Pixar, there was a character for all types of Disney+ fans to collect and enjoy.</p>

<p>'To our customers, we thank you for your excitement and engagement with the Disney+ Ooshies and apologise for any frustration or disappointment caused by running out of stock.</p>

<p>'For those who are still looking to finish their sets, we recommend safely swapping extras or duplicates with family and friends who have also been collecting.'</p>

<p>The response comes after the supermarket chain was flooded with backlash, with many shoppers demanding the store to 'honour' their 'owed' Ooshies.</p>

<p>'I am not a happy customer... I feel that it would be good of Woolworths to honour my owed 15 Ooshies my child now has a box that is not complete, which to her is rather disappointing,' one mother wrote.</p>

<p>A second mother said: 'What the hell. Not happy just did shopping at Woolworths just to get the Ooshies for my kids to be told can't get them, none left.'</p>

<p>A third woman said: 'You owe me eight Ooshies, I purchased extra branded products to achieve this and suddenly it's all gone... This is disgraceful.'</p>

<p>However, many jumped to the supermarket's defence, with one shopper praising the supermarket for 'denying Ooshies to these cry baby parents'</p>

<p>Many saw the funny side to the backlash, with one joking: 'So many adult snowflakes having a cry' over the Ooshies</p>

<p>Others blamed the lack of Ooshie stock on savvy sellers who are attempting to earn some extra cash by selling the collectables online</p>

<p>Many shoppers have been 'hoarding' the collectables so they could sell them to others - as the country faces an Ooshies shortage</p>

<p>However, many jumped to the supermarket's defence, with one saying: 'I just want to say that you're doing the right thing by denying Ooshies to these cry baby parents. Half of these sad sods don't even have kids. Carry on being hilarious. The meltdowns warm my heart.'</p>

<p>Another shopper said: 'So many adult snowflakes having a cry over a piece of [toy] designed for children.' </p>

<p>And one added: 'Three simple words in the promotion's terms and conditions... While stocks last! Go cry your river elsewhere.'</p>

<p>Others blamed the lack of Ooshie stock on savvy sellers who are attempting to earn some extra cash by selling the collectables online.</p>

<p>'This is one of the reasons why the Ooshies have run out fast. It is suppose to be a fun collecting activity for families, not a money making adventure for some,' one woman said.</p>

<p>Woolworths announced shoppers will have just days to collect the Disney+ Ooshies collectables as the campaign is expected to end this weekend</p>

<p>Due to extraordinary demand, Woolworths announced it expects all Ooshies stock will be collected by customers by the end of this week.</p>

<p>Victorian shoppers still have time to collect the figurines over the coming weeks after the launch was delayed across the state due to Stage Four restrictions. </p>

<p>'It's apparent customers of all ages have loved collecting these Ooshies and their popularity completely exceeded our expectations. Because of this, we expect the last of our stock to be collected by the end of this weekend,' Woolworths' chief marketing officer Andrew Hicks said.</p>

<p>Mr Hicks reassured Victorian shoppers there will be plenty of Ooshies around to collect in the weeks ahead while supplies last. </p>

<p>'I want to reassure our Victorian customers these lower stock levels do not apply to them. We created a separate allotment from when we delayed the launch of the program,' he said.</p>

<p>He added: 'We're thrilled to see how many customers have enjoyed collecting the Disney+ Ooshies since its launch... particularly during a very challenging year.</p>

<p>'We'd like to thank our team for their support in executing the program in stores and online and our customers for helping us create such a memorable program.' </p>

<p>Pre-loved or unwanted Ooshies can be recycled in any Woolworths store until January 31, 2021.</p>

<p>Customers can drop their Ooshies (including last year's Lion King Ooshies) and Ooshies wrappers in the dedicated TerraCycle bins in stores. </p>

<p>TerraCycle will then turn these Ooshies into plastic pellets, which can be used to make outdoor products such as park benches.</p>

<p>In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, a Woolworths spokesman said:</p>

<p>At Woolworths, we're always looking for ways to create a bit of fun and excitement for our customers.</p>
