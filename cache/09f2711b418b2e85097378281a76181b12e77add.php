<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Governor of the Bank of England last night piled pressure on Rishi Sunak to provide more help for businesses hit by the latest Covid restrictions.</p>

<p>In a rare political intervention, Andrew Bailey asked the Chancellor to ‘rethink’ the furlough scheme, which is due to finish at the end of next month.</p>

<p>Mr Bailey has previously backed the decision to bring the £40billion job subsidy scheme to an end. </p>

<p>But addressing a British Chambers of Commerce event yesterday, Mr Bailey said some sectors will need more help as the scheme ends.</p>

<p>The Governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey (pictured) last night piled pressure on Rishi Sunak to provide more help for businesses hit by the latest Covid restrictions</p>

<p>He said he did not want to ‘tie the Chancellor’s hands’ by offering a specific remedy.</p>

<p>He said ‘we’ve moved from a world of generalised employment protection’ to ‘focused areas,’ so a blanket scheme was no longer needed – but that it was time to ‘stop and rethink the approach going forward’.</p>

<p>In the Commons yesterday, Boris Johnson hinted that Mr Sunak was preparing new assistance for the hardest-hit sectors, and said the Government would do ‘everything we can to protect lives and livelihoods’.</p>

<p>Labour yesterday stepped up its call for the scheme to be extended – something Mr Johnson and the Chancellor have repeatedly ruled out.</p>

<p>Mr Bailey has previously backed The Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak's (pictured) decision to bring the £40billion job subsidy scheme to an end</p>

<p>In its current form, the scheme pays 80 per cent of the wages of those signed up. </p>

<p>But with the restrictions now likely to last months, some Tories also urged the PM to come forward with more financial support.</p>

<p>Business groups yesterday warned that additional financial support would be essential, amid fears that the government’s new Covid restrictions could stifle the economic recovery for months.</p>

<p>Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said it was ‘desperately urgent to have a successor to the furlough scheme’.</p>

<p>She added: ‘It has saved thousands and thousands of jobs but there is a cliff-edge looming. And, now, with today’s announcement that is more urgent than ever.</p>

<p>‘We are calling for the Treasury to announce a successor scheme very quickly. It should be more targeted. </p>

<p>It doesn’t need to be quite as generous. But, if we are going to protect jobs... in the medium-term it needs to be brought in within days or weeks.’</p>

<p>Roger Barker, of the Institute of Directors, said the new restrictions would ‘inevitably put the brakes on the economic recovery’.</p>

<p>He said businesses would accept the clampdown if it helped head off even more draconian restrictions, but said ministers now had a duty to support the economy.</p>

<p>Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, said it was ‘desperately urgent to have a successor to the furlough scheme’</p>

<p>‘With the return of more restrictions, the onus is squarely on the Government to set out the next phase of its support.</p>

<p>‘Key schemes are set to wind down in the months ahead, but it’s clear that businesses aren’t out of the woods yet.</p>

<p>Even where the Treasury wants to move away from the current shape of flagship measures, it should look to fill the gap to prevent a steep rise in unemployment and insolvencies.’</p>

<p>Douglas Ross, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, yesterday asked for a ‘guarantee’ that the government will ‘continue to support Scottish employers and workers in areas affected by the measures when the furlough scheme ends’.</p>
