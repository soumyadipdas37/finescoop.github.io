<p>Michelle recently admitted she loved the lockdown period because it has given the jet-setting couple the opportunity to spend quality time together, walking their dogs, doing jigsaws and cycling near their Essex home. </p>

<p>Make those reps count: The actress, 33, displayed her envy-inducing toned abs as she worked up a sweat completing a routine from her partner's fitness company, TrainWright</p>

<p>The experience has also given the actress the opportunity to start writing her own material, and she has already had interest from production companies about potentially developing her projects. </p>

<p>She said in a recent interview with Cosmopolitan magazine:  'We [Mark and I] were saying we'd enjoyed it. It's been nice because we've both been working from home. </p>

<p>'Normally we could be out all day or I have to go to Manchester [to film Brassic] or Mark is in London.</p>

<p>Hard work! The Our Girl star wore a chic black sports bra and high-waist leggings as she posed for the camera while surrounded by gym equipment</p>

<p>'I'm taking my dogs for daily walks, I've been doing a jigsaw a week and I've taken up cycling on a proper road bike. We go out three times a week and do 11 miles!</p>

<p>'I'm writing two things. I've never had the time to sit down, write and research and I'm really enjoying the process. It's a comedy drama and a mini-series drama.</p>

<p>'I had the idea for one of them a few years ago and this time has helped me get my ideas down on paper. </p>

<p>'I've had meetings with production companies on Zoom. Hopefully it's something we can get off the ground. It's exciting.'  </p>
