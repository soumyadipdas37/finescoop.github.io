<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He may have swapped League Two outfit Cambridge United for a move to Roma in one of the most intriguing transfer stories of the summer, but Mbunya Alemanji certainly isn't getting carried away. </p>

<p>The teenage forward recently put pen to paper on a three-year contract with Roma, who acquired his signature despite not having seen him play in the flesh.</p>

<p>Cambridge will receive approximately £70,000 in compensation, and the 16-year-old will join up with Roma's Under 17s side initially - starting off as a scholar for one year before turning professional.</p>

<p>But despite making the glamour move to Italy from League Two outfit Cambridge, Alemanji is keeping grounded.</p>

<p>'It is a big move but I'm just trying to prove why I'm there,' Alemanji told BBC Sport.</p>

<p>'My friends have been saying to me: "Do you realise you're at AS Roma?" I'm just trying to keep calm.'</p>

<p>Alemanji move to England at just three years old after being born in Germany, and he joined Cambridge at 13.</p>

<p>He played with the League Two side's Under 16s and Under 18s before making the incredible move to Italy.</p>

<p>The 16-year-old's agent then sent video reels of Alemanji to Roma's interim sporting director Morgan de Sanctis earlier this year so that the club could get a taste of what he could offer them going forward.</p>

<p>Alemanji's agent also represents Holland international and Lyon forward Memphis Depay.</p>

<p>Alemanji has signed a three-year contract with the Serie A outfit after moving from Cambridge</p>

<p>'It was during lockdown - my agent contacted me and said: "Roma are interested in you",' Alemanji further explained.</p>

<p>'They are such a big team that I didn't really think much of it. The next week he contacted me again and said you might have to travel to Rome in two weeks. I was like: "Wow." It took longer for it to happen but I eventually signed.'</p>

<p>He has already been star-struck after bumping into former Spain, Barcelona and Chelsea winger Pedro - who joined the club on a free transfer recently. </p>

<p>Alemanji admitted to seeing Pedro at Roma's training complex, where he will be staying, after undergoing coronavirus tests.</p>
