<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After a mammoth summer spend which looks set to smash through the £250million mark, there is plenty of pressure being placed on the shoulders of Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>Gone is the youth revolution and instead Roman Abramovich has backed his manager with big bucks in a bid to gatecrash Liverpool and Manchester City's party at the top of the Premier League.</p>

<p>But it has been far from plain sailing for the club legend, with a less-than-convincing performance against Brighton followed up by a chastening 2-0 defeat at home to Liverpool.</p>

<p>It is, of course, by no means a crisis and Lampard is still waiting to welcome a number of his new signings to the team, but there will be concerns in the camp about a difficult start to the new campaign.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the dilemmas facing Lampard as he looks ahead to a draining season in the Stamford Bridge hotseat...</p>

<p>After the defeat by Liverpool on Sunday evening, Jamie Carragher noted: 'I do look and think, "where does Havertz play?" Where does he fit into a 4-3-3?</p>

<p>'He almost looks like a No 10 and we don't see them as much in football now. Where he played today, I don't think that suited Chelsea.' </p>

<p>After the Brighton game a few days prior, Paul Merson had said on Sky: 'He didn't even look interested at times'.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz has struggled during his first two games at Chelsea, and will need time to settle</p>

<p>While it is very early days in his Chelsea career, there is a certain expectation that comes with a price tag as high as his. Costing the club £89m, Havertz will be expected to hit the ground running and his first two performances have left a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>He was anonymous in both games, with the majority of his headlines coming because of a dreadful misplaced pass straight out of play at the Amex. </p>

<p>Lampard will need to work out, and quick, where his best position is, and the upcoming games against Barnsley, West Brom, Palace and Southampton represent an excellent opportunity for him to grab a goal or two and kick on. </p>

<p>While Chelsea's biggest problem position is the goalkeeper - we'll come to that shortly - not knowing your best centre back partnership is also not going to help shore up the defence.</p>

<p>Against Brighton and Liverpool, Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen lined up in the back four, but Thiago Silva, Fikayo Tomori and Antonio Rudiger are all waiting in the wings for their bite at the cherry.</p>

<p>Lampard was open in admitting his struggles post-match, noting 'we have five centre halves at the club so I can't pick three on the bench', and he will need to decide what to do going forward.</p>

<p>Of course, the transfer window is still open and after Rudiger was completely left out of the squad on Sunday - as revealed by Sportsmail - it looks as though he may be heading for the exit before deadline day.</p>

<p>That still leaves the boss in a difficult position with four players to rotate, and he will want to nail down a partnership to help settle in his new goalkeeper. </p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger (centre) is fully fit but was left out of the squad by Lampard this weekend</p>

<p>Andreas Christensen was one of Chelsea's starting centre backs but he got sent off</p>

<p>And so, that leads us on to the goalkeeper struggles at Stamford Bridge. Kepa Arrizabalaga, famously the most expensive stopper in world football, made yet another howler against the champions and his position as No 1 is almost untenable. </p>

<p>The Blues' chase for a new keeper has been well-documented, and Rennes' Edouard Mendy is soon to arrive in a £25m deal.</p>

<p>He will sign a five-year contract and many fans will expect him to go straight between the sticks, given the dreadful form of Kepa.</p>

<p>Despite the seemingly obvious decision facing Lampard, he will need to treat the situation with caution and not completely freeze Kepa out, given the amount of money the club spent to buy him from Athletic Bilbao. </p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga had yet another match to forget in goal, and fans can't wait to swap him out</p>

<p>Rennes keeper Edouard Mendy is soon to complete his move to Chelsea for £25million</p>

<p>For all the talk of Chelsea's £250m spend, only two of the six signings have actually pulled on the shirt for a competitive match. </p>

<p>While Werner and Havertz are bedding themselves into the first team, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr are all watching on from the stands as they work their way towards full fitness.</p>

<p>The likes of Billy Gilmour and Christian Pulisic are also sidelined at the moment, and with Mendy and potentially more still to come in, it would be unfair to claim that the current XI is a fair representation of what Chelsea will be this season.</p>

<p>Lampard will be keen to get his new players in as quickly as possible to ensure that the likes of Liverpool and Manchester City don't pull away, and the medical staff will be working overtime at Cobham to ensure that they can soon line up in the Premier League. </p>

<p>Thiago Silva (left) and Ben Chilwell are among the new signings ready to come into the team</p>

<p>Hakim Ziyech is also working his way back to fitness after picking up an injury in pre-season</p>

<p>Training sessions are important at any point in the season, but pre-season and the first few weeks of the season are arguably the most vital as new players meet their team-mates and try and bed themselves into the squad.</p>

<p>Chelsea's early fixtures have shown that both Werner and Havertz will need some time to gel with their team-mates, with Werner making plenty of runs but not being found by his team-mates.</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, it feels as though Havertz is yet to nail down his perfect position too, and so Lampard will be keen to mould his team together between matches to ensure that they can fight at the top of the league.</p>

<p>Manchester City and Liverpool haven't bought as big as the Blues, and therefore have far more team cohesion as the campaign gets well and truly underway. Lampard will be working round the clock to ensure his side keep pace. </p>

<p>Timo Werner is making plenty of runs but isn't being found by his new Chelsea team-mates</p>

<p>Lampard has plenty of problems to solve but the future still looks very bright at Chelsea</p>
