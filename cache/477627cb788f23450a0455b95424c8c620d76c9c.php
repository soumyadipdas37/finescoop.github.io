<p>The Switch will be an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Beth O'Leary.</p>

<p>Set in the UK, it's the story of what happens when a 29-year-old consultant in London swaps lives with her 79-year-old grandmother who lives in Yorkshire in the north of England.</p>

<p>The consultant finds herself plunged into the life of a small village where she walks dogs and participates in neighbourhood watch.</p>

<p>Her grandmother, meanwhile, has to adapt to a tiny flat, dating apps and starting up a social club for lonely Londoners.  </p>

<p>In an official news release from the studio, Rachel said she 'was utterly charmed and deeply moved' by the novel and added she 'can't wait' to share the story with everyone.' </p>

<p>The actress first got noticed for her roles in The Blacklist and House of Cards.</p>

<p>But her career really took off with the Amazon Original Series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel in which she plays a late 1950's New York housewife with a bent for stand-up comedy.</p>
