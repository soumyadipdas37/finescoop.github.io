<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joe Biden made another gaffe on Sunday when he declared an estimated 200 million Americans had died from COVID-19 - but the death toll is actually just under 200,000.</p>

<p>The Democratic presidential nominee made the remark during a campaign event at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>With just 44 days until the embattled election, both Biden and President Trump have revved up their campaigning to secure votes before Americans go to the polls.</p>

<p>While discussing the devastation the COVID-19 pandemic has leveled against the United States and Trump, Biden accidentally claimed that nearly two-thirds of the country had died.</p>

<p>'If Donald Trump has his way, the complications from COVID-19, which are well beyond what they should be - it's estimated that 200 million people have died -- probably by the time I finish this talk,' said Biden.</p>

<p>Although the number of COVID-19 deaths are staggering in the United States -even more so when compared to some other countries - 200 miillion Americans have not died of the virus.</p>

<p>Biden likely meant to say 200,000 deaths, which the country has slowly edged towards for the last week. As of Sunday, deaths have amassed to 199,421 and there are 6.7 million confirmed cases.   </p>

<p>The former vice president made a similar gaffe at a campaign stop in June, when he said that 120 million Americans had died because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Biden's comments were made while he criticized Trump for his health care policies, which he suggested failed Americans during the pandemic.  </p>

<p>'Millions of Americans are voting because they know their health care hangs in the balance,' Biden said.</p>

<p>'In the middle of the worst global health crisis in living memory, Donald Trump went before the Supreme Court trying to strip health care coverage away from tens of millions of families.</p>

<p>'Strip away the peace of mind from more than one hundred million Americans with preexisting conditions. If he succeeds, he could discriminate against or drop coverage completely from people living with pre-existing conditions like Asthma, diabetes, cancer...'</p>

<p>Biden referred to the Trump administration previously asking the Supreme Court in June to invalidate the Affordable Care Act put forward by former President Barack Obama.</p>

<p>In doing so, certain provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions or who are sick could be dropped. Millions of Americans relied on Obamacare. </p>

<p>Trump has vowed to maintain those protections while facing criticism for his administration's public health response to the pandemic. </p>

<p>He previously slammed Biden over mistaking the COVID-19 death toll, saying: 'If I ever said something so mortifyingly stupid' and 'this is beyond a normal mistake.'</p>

<p>But Trump has been criticized for a number of gaffe's himself over the last four years in the Oval Office.   </p>

<p>According to The Independent, Trump mistakenly referred to the 9/11 terror attacks as '7/11' during a 2016 campaign rally.</p>

<p>'I was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down there on 7/11,' he said to the crowd in Buffalo, New York. </p>

<p>'Down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down, I saw the greatest people I’ve ever seen in action.'</p>

<p>One of his most famous mix ups was when he used the 'covfefe' in a tweet that was meant to read 'coverage,' in 2017.</p>

<p>'Despite the constant negative press covfefe,' the tweet read. The word was soon turned into an ongoing into joke that spawned a plethora of memes.   </p>
