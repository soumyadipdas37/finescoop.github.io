<p>But Orlando Bloom was already preparing to merge his family on Tuesday as he met up with Katy's father Keith Hudson in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Hanging out: Orlando Bloom, 43, was spotted out in Los Angeles on Tuesday as he drove his early-1940s Ford pickup truck to meet his fiancée Katy Perry's father Keith Hudson for coffee</p>

<p>Orlando rocked a casual and rugged look for the meetup with a simple white T-shirt and olive-colored jeans.</p>

<p>He also had on brown suede boots and sported a white mask covered in swirling black lines to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. </p>

<p>He drove to the coffee date in his gorgeously restored cyan pickup truck, which had bright yellow hubcabs.</p>

<p>The actor also had a pair of hydrofoil surfboards in the bed, though it's not clear if he and Keith were looking to catch some waves later in the day.</p>

<p>Riding in style: Orlando rocked a casual white T-shirt with olive jeans and brown suede boots. His cyan pickup had two hydrofoil surfboards in the bed, though it's not clear if he and Keith went surfing</p>

<p>Unlike traditional surfboards, hydrofoil boards have a metal fin attached by a slim metal bar underneath the board.</p>

<p>The added foil allows surfers to ride their boards about two feet above the water's surface, and it gives them more control in windy or choppy conditions that might knock down surfers on normal boards. </p>

<p>Orlando has likely been seeing a lot of his future in-laws following the birth of his daughter Daisy late last month.</p>

<p>The British actor and Katy introduced their bundle of joy to the world on Wednesday, August 26 via Unicef, for whom they serve as Goodwill Ambassadors. </p>

<p>The humanitarian agency released a statement on behalf of the parents: 'We are floating with love and wonder from the safe and healthy arrival of our daughter. But we know we’re the lucky ones and not everyone can have a birthing experience as peaceful as ours was.' </p>
