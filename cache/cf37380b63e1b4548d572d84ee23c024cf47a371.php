<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee is delaying a vote on who should get the coronavirus vaccine first in a nationwide rollout.</p>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which develops guidelines for vaccine administration as well as schedules, was expected to vote virtually on Tuesday. </p>

<p>A plan would be drafted on which groups would be allocated the initial doses of the initial shot - or shots - that are proven safe and effective. </p>

<p>However, members say they want to wait and learn more about which inoculations have the best chance of being approved, The Wall Street Journal reported.  </p>

<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was expected to vote on who gets initial coronavirus vaccine doses on Tuesday. Pictured: Volunteers are given the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in Detroit, Michigan, October 5</p>

<p>There are more than 170 coronavirus vaccine candidates in various stages of development around the globe, according to the World Health Organization.</p>

<p>At least nine are currently in large-scale trials in humans to prove the jabs are both safe and effective. </p>

<p>Two-US based companies, Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, are in late-stage trials and say they expect to know if their vaccines work by October or November.</p>

<p>UK-based AstraZeneca, partnered with the University of Oxford, has resumed its trials in Britain but not in the US after two volunteers developed rare complications.  </p>

<p>The Journal reported that the ACIP may not draft recommendations until the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes a specific vaccine.</p>

<p>Members were allegedly uncomfortable with making guidelines for a vaccine that hasn't been approved by regulators yet. </p>

<p>The CDC websites states that the committee's next meeting is scheduled to take place from October 28 to October 29. </p>

<p>The ACIP's proposed groups for early vaccination include healthcare personnel, essential workers, those with high risk medical conditions and adults aged 65 and older, according to a presentation from a meeting last month. </p>

<p>While most experts agree frontline healthcare workers should get initial doses, it's unclear which group should be next.</p>

<p>Additionally, members are waiting to see if emerging data from clinical trials reveal how effective the vaccine is in the elderly population.</p>

<p>Older adults are among the groups at highest-risk of developing severe cases of COVID-19, which could result in hospitalization and death.</p>

<p>Because the immune system weakens with age, it is often hard for vaccines to induce a sufficient immune response, which has made some experts worry that any experimental vaccine for the coronavirus might not be as effective in the elderly. </p>

<p>The Journal also notes that storage can vary from one jab to another and may affect how easily they can be distributed in nursing homes and long-term care facilities.</p>

<p>Dr William Schaffner told the newspaper that individual states are looking to the ACIP to develop a prioritization plan to come up with their own guidelines, and a delay only makes this process more complicated.</p>

<p>'The states are eager for that and I would hope the ACIP would move expeditiously,' said Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. </p>
