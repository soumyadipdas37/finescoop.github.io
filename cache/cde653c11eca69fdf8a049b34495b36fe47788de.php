<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar has confirmed that he will be staying at the club next season.</p>

<p>The Brazilian forward was left in tears after the Ligue 1 champions were defeated by Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in Lisbon earlier this month.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old £198million man was also heavily linked with a move back to former club Barcelona before coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Neymar has told PSG's official club magazine that he will be staying at the club this season</p>

<p>The 28-year-old was left in tears after the club's defeat in this month's Champions League final</p>

<p>But Neymar has now put any suggestion that he could leave PSG after their European heartbreak to bed and also told the club's official magazine he would like to go one better in this season's Champions League and become a legend in the French capital. </p>

<p>'I'm staying at PSG next season! And with the ambition to return to the Champions League final, this time to win it,' he said.</p>

<p>'I like the idea of doing everything to leave my name in the history books of my club.'</p>

<p>Reports in France have also suggested the Brazilian is attempting to help bring former team-mate Lionel Messi to the club as the wantaway star seeks an exit from Barcelona. </p>

<p>The Brazil international had also been linked to former club Barcelona before the pandemic</p>

<p>Messi sent a burofax to the Catalan giants last week informing them of his desire to leave, and while Manchester City lead the race the French side are doing all they can to secure his signature. </p>

<p>The news also comes just a day after Neymar decided to end his £78.6million partnership with Nike after 15 years.</p>

<p>Neymar's switch of allegiances could be bad news for PSG, with Nike the club's kit supplier.</p>

<p>He also said he wants to go one better in Europe this season and become a legend at the club</p>

<p>The French side had an increase in their contract after signing the megastar, receiving €70m (£62m) as a result of his world record transfer from Barcelona.</p>

<p>Several reports suggest the forward will sign with German company Puma, who are the current kit suppliers of Manchester City and AC Milan.</p>

<p>Nike have sponsored the Brazilian since he was 13 years old, long before he became a professional. </p>

<p>Reports in France suggest he has been trying to convince Lionel Messi to join him at PSG</p>
