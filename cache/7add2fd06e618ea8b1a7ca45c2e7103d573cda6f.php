<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's no secret that Bachelor contestants must sign strict contracts before appearing on the Channel 10 dating show.</p>

<p>And it seems the network and producers Warner Bros. have a rather effective way of ensuring that the show's participants abide by the rules.</p>

<p>A contestant, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Daily Mail Australia she was told she would have 'no chance' of appearing on Bachelor in Paradise if she broke her contract. </p>

<p>'They said to me: "If you do this, you might as well rule out any future appearance on any other Warner Bros. show,"' the source claimed.</p>

<p>Locky Gilbert's contestants were warned not to speak to any magazine, website or podcast about their experiences during filming without the written permission of Warner Bros. </p>

<p>They were also told their social media posts had to be approved by producers.</p>

<p>'If you are caught posting something they don't like, you have to delete it immediately,' the insider added.</p>

<p>The source continued: 'They continually remind you of your signed agreement and ask if you want to return for Bachelor in Paradise.</p>

<p>'We have a bit more freedom once we are get kicked off the show.' </p>

<p>The production team also closely monitors the social media accounts of each of the finalists to make sure they don't leak spoilers - either deliberately or by accident. </p>

<p>Another bugbear for producers is staged paparazzi photos.</p>

<p>'Warner Bros. also really frown upon contestants setting up paparazzi photos... It's a big no-no,' the contestant said. </p>
