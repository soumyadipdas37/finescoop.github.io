<p>The Carabinieri police said the 32-year-old man was caught by the Colosseum's private security and immediately reported to officers</p>

<p>The unnamed man is accused of damaging a historical and artistic landmark, according to CNN, a crime according to Italian law.  </p>

<p>If he is convicted he could be punished with up to one year in prison or a fine of no less than 2,065 euros ($2,400). </p>

<p>Archaeologist Federica Rinaldi, responsible for the ancient Roman amphitheater, said people who carve their initials into the monument want to 'appropriate' it. </p>

<p>He added: 'The Colosseum, like any monument that represents the history of all of us, must be preserved and handed over to future generations.'</p>

<p>The Colosseum, considered one of the seven wonders of the modern world, is a World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>This is along with 54 other Italian sites that comprise the city's historic centre.    </p>

<p>A Russian tourist was fined 20,000 euros in 2014 for carving the letter 'K' on a section of brickwork.</p>

<p>Construction on the Colosseum, believed to be the largest amphitheater in the world, began sometime between 70 and 72 CE under the Flavian emperors. </p>

<p>It seated around 50,000 spectators who came to watch gladiators in combat with each other and dangerous animals.</p>
