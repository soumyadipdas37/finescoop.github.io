<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New York Fashion Week is in full effect but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, designers have had to alter how they present their latest collections.</p>

<p>In lieu of traditional runway shows and presentations, brands like Edie Parker are getting creative. But we would expect nothing less from the iconic accessories label.  </p>

<p>This season, Edie Parker has enlisted RHOBH’s Lisa Rinna to debut its newest collection via a nostalgic infomercial, inspired by the beloved and equally kitschy Home Shopping Network.</p>

<p>And if Lisa's hilarious delivery doesn't convince viewers to purchase a bag, the label's tongue-in-cheek offerings sure will!</p>

<p>From there, her candid personality takes over.  </p>

<p>'I mean, here's hoping that there is a 2021 spring, right?,' she adds while doing the sign of the cross. </p>

<p>Tell us how you really feel: She slings a sunny yellow bag on her forearm and says' talk about fresh as a f*ucking daisy'</p>

<p>In addition to handbags, Edie Parker designed The Baroque Collection, a line of decor, which the housewife says is 'like home goods on steroids.'</p>
