<p>'My dinner dates,' the glamorous Venezuelan/American wrote, adding a white heart emoji and tagging both. </p>

<p>Powers tried to clear the air on Saturday, telling Entertainment Weekly that the pair were introduced by their mutual attorney, who arranged for the fellow Netflix reality stars and their friends to enjoy an evening in LA.</p>

<p>When the group was met with paparazzi during their exit, Farago clung to his arm for security. </p>

<p>'Alex arranged for both Francesca and I to meet with him for dinner at the Eveleigh in West Hollywood along with some of our other friends, including Mitchell Crawford and Raiane Macedo.'</p>

<p>'We all planned to leave the Eveleigh together in the same car. Francesca, Alex, Mitchell and Raiane all exited through a side entrance, while I exited through the main entrance of the Eveleigh,' he continued. </p>

<p>'Upon exiting the Eveleigh, we were all greeted by paparazzi. Francesca grabbed on to me in an attempt to shield herself from the paparazzi as our entire group entered the car. </p>

<p>'Francesca and I are not dating or romantically involved but remain friends,' he concluded. </p>

<p>Farago seems to have her heart elsewhere, seen getting very cozy with Aussie model Casey Boonstra, 26, during their trip to Venice Beach last week.</p>

<p>She met Harry and began dating during her stint on Netflix's Too Hot To Handle.</p>

<p>She stated at the time that he instigated the break-up because 'he couldn't do long-distance anymore.'</p>

<p>Harry confirmed as much in a follow-up video, though he claimed the split was for the sake of his mental health.</p>

<p>And Francesca, or Frankie, posted her own confessional YouTube video in June, in which she discussed the breakup as well and how she needed to 'move on'. </p>
