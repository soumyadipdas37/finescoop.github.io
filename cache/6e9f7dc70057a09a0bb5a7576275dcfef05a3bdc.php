<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Irena Srbinovska may have won Locky Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor finale on Thursday.</p>

<p>But it seems the nurse, 31, failed to put her best foot forward in the fashion stakes when she met with her new beau's mother Brenda at the beginning of the episode.</p>

<p>Fans of the show were quick to notice the brunette beauty's sartorial faux pas, and were quick to mock it on Twitter, including one who wrote: 'I'm just gonna say it. Irena's dress is gross.'</p>

<p>'I want to burn it!' Irena Srbinovska's two-toned frock on The Bachelor was branded 'gross' and 'unflattering' by fans of the show</p>

<p>'Can't focus on anything beyond how much I want to burn Irena's awful dress,' another shared.</p>

<p>'Who designed Irena's dress? Harvey Dent?' quipped a third fan, before a fourth cut close to the bone. </p>

<p>'Irena has no fashion sense or man sense,' they wrote.</p>

<p>Ouch! 'Can't focus on anything beyond how much I want to burn Irena's awful dress,' wrote one viewer</p>

<p>Passionate: Fans unleashed about how much they hated Irena's frock </p>

<p>'Wardrobe department: Do you wanna wear a red dress or a blue dress? Irena: Yes,' a fifth wrote.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, others took aim at the wardrobe department for not preventing the fashion blunder, including one who commented: 'Irena is beautiful but that is the ugliest dress and very unflattering wardrobe people.'</p>

<p>Another shared a meme that said: 'Irena and the wardrobe designer deciding on the red or the blue dress,' and included a photo that read: 'Both is good.' </p>

<p>'Very unflattering': Meanwhile, others took aim at the wardrobe department for not averting the fashion blunder</p>

<p>In the end, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena over Bella Varelis. </p>

<p>He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'</p>

<p>Happy ending! In the end, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena</p>
