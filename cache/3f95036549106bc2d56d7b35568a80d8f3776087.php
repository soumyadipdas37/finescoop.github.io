<p>They're still number one! Kyle Sandilands (right) and Jackie 'O' Henderson (left) have dominated Sydney's FM radio ratings for the fourteenth consecutive time - beating out rivals Jonesy and Amanda</p>

<p>Sandilands and Henderson won with an audience share of 10.2 per cent, placing them well ahead of their WSFM rivals, who had a 8.6 per cent share. </p>

<p>Nova 96.9’s Fitzy &amp; Wippa - also known as Ryan Fitzgerald and Michael Wipfli - took third place with a 6.5 per cent share, down from 7.7 per cent from the last survey in April.</p>

<p>Australia's favourite duo! Sandilands and Henderson won with an audience share of 10.2 per cent</p>

<p>'Thank you to our listeners for choosing us to be your light amongst the shade. There’s only a few months until the year is over, let’s get through it together!' </p>

<p>The pair currently have more listeners than any other FM Breakfast show in Australia. </p>
