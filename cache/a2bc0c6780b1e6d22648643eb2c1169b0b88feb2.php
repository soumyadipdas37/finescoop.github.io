<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Saturday's Women's Super League fixture between West Ham and Arsenal will be played in front of spectators despite the latest Government Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>The match at Dagenham's Chigwell Construction Stadium is earmarked as a pilot event for the return of fans with up to 1,000 in attendance.</p>

<p>Some of the other pilot events took the decision to go ahead behind closed doors after the Government announced on Wednesday that spectators would be limited to 1,000 people.</p>

<p>West Ham's Women's Super League fixture with Arsenal on Saturday evening will take place with up to 1,000 spectators in attendance at the Chigwell Construction Stadium </p>

<p>A restricted crowd will be admitted to Dagenham's home stadium for Saturday night's game</p>

<p>But the Hammers are still preparing to welcome back some fans for the 5.20pm kick-off, which will be televised live on BT Sport.</p>

<p>A statement on West Ham's website read: 'The Hammers' first home fixture of the season, after the summer move to Dagenham &amp; Redbridge FC, has been selected as one of the pilot events to test the return of spectators to elite sporting fixtures.</p>

<p>'The club has continued to work in line with the latest Government guidance and has held ongoing discussions with the FA, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), Barking and Dagenham Council, Dagenham &amp; Redbridge FC and the Safety Advisory Group, all of whom have given their full backing and support to continue with this match as a pilot event.</p>

<p>Arsenal celebrate one of their goals in their WSL opener against Reading last weekend</p>

<p>'The club has put robust and thorough plans in place as the safety and well-being of our supporters, players and staff remains the club's absolute priority.'</p>

<p>Tickets were only made available to West Ham season ticket holders and social distancing will be enforced in the stands at Dagenham's 6,078-capacity stadium.</p>

<p>The fan  pilot event planned for Saturday's League Two fixture between Cambridge United and Carlisle United at the Abbey Stadium - which was to see 2,000 spectators attend - has been cancelled with the game behind closed doors.</p>

<p>Cambridge have confirmed no spectators will attend their match against Carlisle on Saturday</p>

<p>Cambridge had fans in their stadium for the EFL Cup match with Fulham U21s earlier this week</p>

<p>Any pilot events from now on are likely to be capped at a capacity of 1,000 people</p>

<p>Likewise the T20 Blast cricket fixture between Yorkshire and Durham set for next Wednesday at Headingley in Leeds.</p>

<p>In addition to the West Ham vs Arsenal fixture, fans will also be admitted at the Premiership rugby union game between Gloucester and Harlequins at Kingsholm on Monday.</p>

<p>DCMS reduced the number of people that can attend sporting events to 1,000 following an increase in the number of positive coronavirus cases in the UK.</p>

<p>It came as the Government restricted social gathering to no more than six people from Monday.</p>
