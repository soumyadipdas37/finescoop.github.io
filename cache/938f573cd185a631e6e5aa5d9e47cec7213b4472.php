<p>Lindsey O'Brien, 35, gripped onto the armrests before flipping upside down and using her feet to close four luggage containers above.</p>

<p>She twirled back down to the aisle and lifted her arms in triumph as her fellow crew members cheered her on.</p>

<p>The video was filmed in June aboard an aircraft which had been grounded in her home city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, due to Covid-19.</p>

<p>Lindsey, who has been a flight attendant for six and a half years, said: 'We were on the ground in between flights and my friend wanted to try the move.</p>

<p> Lindsey O'Brien, 35, shows off her acrobatic skills to close overhead lockers with her feet</p>

<p>The flight attendant performed the stunt while the crew's plane was grounded in Pennsylvania</p>

<p>'I used to do yoga and I was a cheerleader growing up so my core is pretty strong and I had to see if I could do it.'</p>

<p>In the video, Lindsey can be seen placing her hands on the seats either side of the aisle before turning herself upside down.</p>

<p>She then proceeds to shut the overhead compartments with her feet before returning to a standing position in the middle of the aisle, much to the delight of her colleagues. </p>

<p>Lindsey, who has asked that we do not reveal the airline she works for, admitted that it took about 20 tries to get the perfect take.</p>

<p>'Every time I did it one bin wouldn't close, we wanted me to close four at once.'</p>

<p>Lindsey, pictured, has been a flight attendant for six and a half years and says it took 20 tries </p>

<p>She added that the video was a welcome relief from the strain of working as a flight attendant during a pandemic.</p>

<p>'This was one of those times when we were trying to make the best of a crazy situation.</p>

<p>'We always wear our masks when we are around passengers and at airports and this was just a rare occasion when we could kick back and just have some fun.</p>

<p>'I don't even remember what airport we were at.' </p>
