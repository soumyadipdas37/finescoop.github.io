<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal legend Ray Parlour has slammed Alexis Sanchez after the forward revealed he wanted to leave Manchester United after his first training session. </p>

<p>On Thursday Sanchez posted a video on Instagram explaining what went wrong during his spell as a United player, drawing strong criticism from Parlour.</p>

<p>The Chilean joined the club from Arsenal in January 2018 in a deal which saw Henrikh Mkhitaryan move in the opposite direction, but Sanchez was only able to score five goals in 45 appearances before spending the 2019-20 season on loan at Inter Milan.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old completed a permanent move to the San Siro last month and has since taken to social media to set the record straight.</p>

<p>'I want to tell you about my period at United, about many things that were said and that made me look bad,' said Sanchez.</p>

<p>'I got the opportunity to go to United and it seemed tempting to me. It was something nice for me, because, when I was a kid, I liked that club a lot.</p>

<p>'I ended up signing without much information about what was happening in the move. The first days that I was with my colleagues, sometimes there are things that you do not realise until you arrive.</p>

<p>Sanchez released a video on Thursday in which he revealed he considered quitting United </p>

<p>'The first training I had I realised many things. I came home and I told my representative: 'Can't the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?'</p>

<p>'They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It (the contract) had already been signed.' </p>

<p>Now Parlour has had his say on Sanchez's Instagram video. He told talkSPORT: 'I can't believe you want to leave a club after one training session. How does that work?!</p>

<p>'You've got to give yourself a chance; it's new surroundings and a different way of training than at Arsenal.</p>

<p>'And it shouldn't come down to wages, but he was on £560,000-a-week and he wants to leave straight away?! You've got to work hard.'</p>

<p>Sanchez suggests he became a scapegoat at United due to a run of disappointing results</p>

<p>Parlour added: 'How can you say, as a player, when you turn up to a club you want to leave the next day?</p>

<p>'That's not right. That mentality should not be in a footballer.</p>

<p>'You should say, "it's Manchester United, one of the biggest clubs in the world, and I've got to fight for my position and make sure I try to perform like I did at Arsenal".'</p>

<p>'It might be a different style of football, it might not suit him, but you've got to try and win the fans over, the players over – everybody over. And that is what he didn't do.'</p>
