<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A female 'poo jogger' left a disgusting surprise in a family's driveway while on an early morning run.</p>

<p>Fiona Mays, from Leederville in Perth, said the jogger defecated next to her home on Friday morning before her family had left to go to work.  </p>

<p>Ms Mays shared graphic details of the 'urgent poo' on social media and described how she was forced to clean up the vile mess. </p>

<p>'So this morning there was a lady jogger around 8am who decided to leave us a nice Friday present,' Ms Mays captioned a photo of the mess. </p>

<p>A female poo jogger left a vile 'urgent poo' (pictured above) in the driveway of a family home on a busy street in Leederville, north Perth, at about 8am on Friday morning</p>

<p>Fiona Mays shared a picture and details of the disgusting mess to social media (pictured) and said her family assumed the jogger had wandered into their driveway to use the bin</p>

<p>Ms Mays said the family assumed the jogger had wandered into the driveway to use the bin outside their Oxford Street home. </p>

<p>'She came down our driveway and we thought nothing of it and maybe she was putting something in our bin...</p>

<p>'Until we left for work and saw she had left us a big sloppy s**t... f*****g disgusting,' Ms Mays explained.  </p>

<p>She said the woman was aged in her 40s or 50s and wearing jogging gear.   </p>

<p>'Not sure if she is known around the area or has done it anywhere else.    </p>

<p>'She was mooching around our drive and then must of done it,' Ms Mays wrote. </p>

<p>Ms Mays said she was 'surprised no one saw her at that time of the morning' and the family lived in a busy area.    </p>

<p>'The reason I put it up is I know there has been a few serial pooers and was wondered if anyone else knew of her. </p>

<p>'I think it's disgusting that someone feels the need to go on private property and leave that for someone else to clean. </p>

<p>'In my opinion s**t your pants and clean your own mess!'</p>

<p>Leederville residents labelled the act as 'totally disgusting' and said there was 'no excuse for it'.    </p>

<p>'What is wrong with people?' one commenter asked.</p>

<p>'As if a person did this on someone's property,' another user wrote.   </p>

<p>'What the actual f*ck. Is this something you should report to the police?'    </p>

<p>The strange incident is not an isolated one in Australia, with similar cases also unfolding in Sydney and Brisbane.</p>

<p>Last year, Sydney PR queen Roxy Jacenko had her office blighted by an unknown woman who later came to be known as the 'Paddington Pooper'.</p>

<p>High-flying business executive Andrew Douglas Macintosh became Australia’s original ‘poo-jogger’ in 2018, after being photographed with his pants down in a Brisbane park. </p>

<p>Ms Mays said she discovered the disgusting poo when she left her home on Oxford Street (pictured above) to go to work and was forced to clean it up</p>
