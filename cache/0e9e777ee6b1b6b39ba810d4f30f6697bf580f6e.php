<p>Nick Kyrgios wasted no time after Novak Djokovic's moment of madness and took to Twitter</p>

<p>Djokovic shocked the tennis world after hitting a line-judge and being automatically ejected</p>

<p>It comes as the latest in a long string of controversies from Djokovic, and Kyrgios couldn't help but be critical of the Serbian once again.</p>

<p>Creating a poll via Twitter, Kyrgios wrote: 'Swap me for jokers incident. "Accidentally hitting the ball kid in the throat" how many years would I be banned for?' </p>

<p>He then gave fans the option to vote between three options of five years, 10 years or a 20-year ban.</p>

<p>The Australian made a major hint at favouritism within the sport, while he is often portrayed as the bad boy of tennis for much less severe incidents.</p>

<p>Djokovic protested but then shook hands with Pablo Carreno Busta after defaulting the match</p>

<p>The Serbian star trudged off, exiting the US Open despite being the overwhelming favourite </p>

<p>A majority percentage of fans voted for '20 years' on Kyrgios's poll, seemingly agreeing with the 25-year-old that tennis' governing bodies come down much harder when he is in the spotlight.</p>

<p>Djokovic, 33, had already been showing signs of frustration at the resistance being put up by Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta when he was broken for 5-6 in the opening set.</p>

<p>After Djokovic saw red and struck the line-judge, referee Soeren Friemel was summoned onto court inside the deserted Arthur Ashe Stadium by umpire Aurelie Tourte. Djokovic was then told, after plenty of debate, that there was no option and he had to go.</p>

<p>Djokovic could then be heard pleading for leniency, protesting: 'She doesn't have to go to the hospital for this.</p>

<p>'You're going to choose a default in this situation? My career, Grand Slam, centre stage?'</p>

<p>In recent months Kyrgios has been more outspoken than ever before, appearing to be a voice of reason amid the madness of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Kyrgios has kicked up a fuss after he is repeatedly made out to be the bad boy of tennis</p>

<p>Tweeting a video of players from the Adria Tour event partying in a nightclub, Kyrgios said the decision to play amid the pandemic made his previous indiscretions pale by comparison </p>

<p>Kyrgios had warned about the,'MQA dangers of the virus and the need to keep adhering to social distancing, before publicly slamming Djokovic after the world No.1 made the poor judgement of arranging his 'Adria Tour.' </p>

<p>Several personnel ended up contracting coronavirus, including Djokovic himself as he later tested positive.</p>

<p>Alongside a video of some of the players partying in a nightclub, Kyrgios had written on Twitter: 'Prayers up to all the players that have contracted Covid-19. Don't <?php echo e('@'); ?> me for anything I've done that has been 'irresponsible' or classified as 'stupidity' - this takes the cake.'</p>

<p>Later, after Croatian player Borna Coric announced he'd tested positive, Kyrgios wrote: 'Boneheaded decision to go ahead with the 'exhibition'. Speedy recovery fellas, but that's what happens when you disregard all protocols. This IS NOT A JOKE.'</p>
