<p>Teenage baker Morgan Hipworth's 'ultimate chocolate brownies', which can be made from supermarket ingredients in three simple steps</p>

<p>He starts by pressing ready-made cookie dough into the base of a greased baking dish.</p>

<p>One of the best-selling brands in Australia is Aunty Kath's $4.80 rolled cookie dough, which is available from leading supermarket like Coles and Woolworths. </p>

<p>Getting started on the brownie batter, Mr Hipworth loads all the ingredients into a mixing bowl and whisks until smooth and thick.</p>

<p>Then he spoons the mixture over the cookie dough and bakes it in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 20 minutes until soft and gooey - it's really that simple.</p>

<p>Delighted followers quickly flooded the comments section with messages like 'mate, you are awesome', 'this makes me so hungry' and 'I'm making these tonight. </p>
