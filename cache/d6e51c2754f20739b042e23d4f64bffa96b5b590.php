<p>Looking good! The Aussie actor accentuated his muscles by wearing a tight black T-shirt teamed with slim black jeans</p>

<p>The outing comes after Hugh lost out on the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie to Mark Ruffalo last week </p>

<p>The star participated in a first-of-its-kind virtual Emmy Awards telecast hosted by Jimmy Kimmel.</p>

<p>He was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role in Bad Education but lost out to Mark, who played two characters in I Know This Much is True.</p>

<p>Due to the pandemic, nominees were streamed in to the show from all around the globe via professional production kits sent out by the Academy.</p>

<p>For the major awards, a crew member in a hazmat suit was sent to wherever the nominees were beaming in from with the golden Emmy statute - ready to present it if they won.</p>

<p>That meant even the losers of each category were able to glimpse the award that just slipped through their fingers.</p>

<p>Good sport! The outing comes after Hugh lost out on the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie to Mark Ruffalo last week</p>

<p>Safety first! Staying safe, Hugh also wore a protective face mask</p>

<p>Emmy's producer Phil Rosenberg was on such crew member who was dispatched to Hugh and his wife Deborra-Lee Furness's multi million dollar Manhattan apartment.</p>

<p>'Every single one of us were sent an Emmy, none of them were engraved,' Rosenberg told E! News. 'Only Ernst &amp; Young knew who the winners were, they keep that under lock-and-key…We had to send [awards] to every person's house.'</p>

<p>Rosenberg said the team used a app similar to a Walkie-Talkie to communicate globally and only found out who'd won the category seconds before the presenter announced the name.</p>

<p>'Before they went into the category, during a commercial break, there was a moment where all of the nominees got pushed into a Zoom together and they could chat,' Rosenberg explained. 'I overheard them congratulating each other.'</p>

<p>When Ruffalo was announced the winner of Hugh's category, Rosenberg said there is was a bit tense but ultimately the actor was gracious.</p>

<p>Ready to rumble: The Broadway star carried a leather gym bag and a protein shake as he made his way to his chauffeured car</p>

<p>'They seemed great about it,' he said. 'They had a great time, they were the sweetest of people.' </p>

<p>As for Hugh, despite his loss, he has received wide praise from fans and critics alike for his role as a corrupt school superintendent in Bad Education, with many calling it the actor's best performance yet.</p>

<p>And, Hugh and Deborra-Lee still had plenty to celebrate as Bad Education did take home a Creative Arts Emmy for Outstanding Television Movie on Saturday.</p>
