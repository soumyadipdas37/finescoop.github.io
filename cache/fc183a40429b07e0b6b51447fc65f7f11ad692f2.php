<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are in talks over bringing in Uruguayan striker Edinson Cavani on a free transfer.</p>

<p>The Red Devils have endured an underwhelming start to their Premier League campaign, losing their opener at home to Crystal Palace before an uninspired last-gasp victory at Brighton.</p>

<p>And following their alarming start, United want to bolster their attack by signing experienced striker Cavani for free this summer after the expiration of his Paris Saint-Germain contract at the end of last season.</p>

<p>Manchester United could opt for the cheap option by signing Edinson Cavani this summer</p>

<p>United have endured a frustrating summer transfer window, after struggling in their big-money pursuit of Jadon Sancho - with Borussia Dortmund standing firm over their £108million valuation of the player. </p>

<p>While their priority target remains England international Sancho, the Red Devils have been exploring other options just in case and may look to bring in Cavani after the striker was offered to the club as he goes in search of European football again.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old enjoyed an illustrious time at the Parc des Princes with PSG, scoring an incredible 200 times in 301 appearances for the club.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperately eyeing late reinforcements following a frustrating window</p>

<p>Cavani won six Ligue 1 titles, four French Cups and five French League Cups during his time in Paris. </p>

<p>Furthermore, United have also been offered the opportunity to sign Luka Jovic on loan from Real Madrid.</p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane is happy to let Jovic leave on loan and the 22-year-old has been offered to a number of clubs around Europe.</p>

<p>Jovic joined Madrid from Eintracht Frankfurt for £55m last year but he has managed just two goals in 28 appearances and has been hampered by niggling injuries. </p>
