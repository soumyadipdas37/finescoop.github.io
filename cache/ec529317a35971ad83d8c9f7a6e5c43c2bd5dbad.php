<p>Two men have been arrested for allegedly being part of a text message scam that steals Australian's identities and their money</p>

<p>Police will allege the men had direct access to and control of the SMS boxes, which sent more than 10,000 messages in two weeks.</p>

<p>In one instance, a person allegedly lost $30,000 after 45 customers from one bank were targeted. </p>

<p>One telecommunications provider found 49,000 texts made to their customers in one week.</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Police worked with organisations such as Westpac, the Commonwealth Bank, ANZ and TPG Telecom.  </p>

<p>The 50-year-old man from Macquarie Park was charged with eight counts of false or misleading information, one count of using a telecommunications network with intent to commit serious offence and one count of drug possession.</p>

<p>He was also charged with dealing in identification information using a carriage service,  honestly obtaining or dealing in financial information and dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime.</p>

<p>Smishing is a emerging form phishing.</p>

<p>It is when scammers use text messaging to trick people into giving them personal information. </p>

<p>People are told not to trust texts from people they don't know. </p>

<p>The 30-year-old is expected to face similar charges.   </p>

<p>Chris Goldsmid, AFP Commander Cybercrime Operations, said: 'This fraud syndicate had absolutely no regard for the hardworking Australians they stole from, victims who may be struggling since the bushfires and COVID-19 hit the nation.'</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Matthew Craft, Commander from NSW Police's Cybercrime squad, said offenders are adapting to technology to stop them.  </p>

<p>'These types of scams become somewhat redundant when the community heeds the advice to never provide confidential personal information to people you don't know and can't identify,' he said.</p>

<p>Legitimate businesses will never call or SMS customers seeking confidential information. Always be suspicious when you receive such requests.' </p>
