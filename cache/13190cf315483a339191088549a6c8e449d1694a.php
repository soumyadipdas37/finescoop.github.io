<p>The co-owner of a popular burger chain has slammed a video showing partygoers dancing shoulder to shoulder while his restaurant is crippled by COVID-19 social distancing rules</p>

<p>Milky Lane's Christian Avant shared footage showing revellers dancing at a Burleigh Heads Park, on the Gold Coast, on Sunday night</p>

<p>Mr Avant, who has a store at Surfers Paradise, accused authorities of double standards as he claimed a restaurant owner would have been fined thousands of dollars if they allowed as many people into their venue.  </p>

<p>'I'm all for people having fun but there seems to be different sets of rules for different scenarios,' he posted on Facebook. </p>

<p>'I have friends that own bars, clubs and venues where if one single person dances or stands up, you get a heavy fine.'</p>

<p>Queensland has placed restrictions on cafes, restaurants and pubs to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>1) Venues that are smaller than 200 squared metres are limited to 50 patrons at one time.</p>

<p>2) Patrons can order and pay for their food at the counter but must be seated when eating their food.</p>

<p>3) Venues must keep the contact details of their patrons for 56 days.</p>

<p>4) Anyone who breaches health rules risks a $4,000 fine and six months imprisonment.</p>

<p>'But hundreds of people dancing side-by-side to bongos in a park gets past every current law and rule set by the Queensland Government.'</p>

<p>Venues that are smaller than 200 square metres are limited to one person per two square metres.</p>

<p>Restaurants must also keep the contact details of patrons for 56 days.</p>

<p>Fines of up to $4,000 and six months imprisonment can be handed out to anyone found in breach of health rules.</p>

<p>Mr Avant said the restrictions were badly damaging businesses.</p>

<p>'Let's even for a second look beyond the COVID virus factor and go into the current rulings and regulations around it,' he said.</p>

<p>'I'm still only allowed 30 per cent capacity at my Milky Lane restaurants and it's HEAVILY policed. 'We've probably lost $500k-1m in potential revenue due to the limitations during COVID.'</p>

<p>Mr Avant called for the Queensland Government to revise its restrictions for businesses.</p>

<p>'If things like this are 'allowed', then the state needs to open up and let hospitality operators have a piece of the pie too.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia contacted Queensland Police for comment. </p>
