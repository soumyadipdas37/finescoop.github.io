<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After more than 10 years on the air, AMC's hugely popular show The Walking Dead will end after season 11, it has been confirmed. </p>

<p>The cable network revealed the news on Wednesday revealing that the final season will feature 24 episodes, stretched out over two years, whereas previous seasons have only had 16 episodes.</p>

<p>The zombie-heavy series - from creator Robert Kirkman - will continue airing through to late 2020, with the show getting a fittingly slow and painful death.</p>

<p>It's over! The Walking Dead to end after season 11... but there are two more spin-offs in the works at AMC</p>

<p>However, it's not entirely the end of the road - as AMC has said it still plans to expand the Walking Dead universe, with a number of spin-offs, including a straight-to-series order for a drama that will follow Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Carol (Melissa McBride). </p>

<p>The third spin-off from the show is yet to be given a title, but is expected to launch in 2023, once The Walking Dead is over. </p>
