<p>Confronted! Keeping Up with the Kardashians star Kourtney Kardashian (L) told her half-sister Kendall Jenner (R) she 'was not happy' that she rated her the worst parent of their siblings while doing a joint interview</p>

<p>'I'd say [my half-brother] Rob is number one. He is so good to his daughter. That's so hard! They're all amazing. Then it would be like Khloé, Kim, Kylie, Kourtney.'</p>

<p>The 41-year-old Poosh founder was eventually informed of the 'joke' insult after running into Kendall at a party.</p>

<p>'I went up to you because I was like, "I'm going to put Rob before us and the rest,"' Jenner clarified on Thursday's episode of Sibling Revelry with Kate Hudson and Oliver Hudson.</p>

<p>'"So I'm just going to throw them out there," and I swear to God Kourtney happened to be the last one.' </p>

<p>Kardashian said she thought the Stuck With U video vixen only picked her because Kim Kardashian West and Kylie Jenner would have flipped out otherwise.</p>

<p>'I don't know if I make an easy target or if they think I'm not gonna say anything,' the half-Armenian beauty marveled.</p>

<p>'Or if it's just like if she would've said that about Kim or Kylie. Me or Khloé would've been the easiest ones to say it about.'</p>

<p>Kourtney has three children - son Mason, 10; daughter Penelope, 8; and son Reign, 5 - with Talentless CEO Scott Disick, whom she split from in 2015 after an on/off nine-year relationship.    </p>
