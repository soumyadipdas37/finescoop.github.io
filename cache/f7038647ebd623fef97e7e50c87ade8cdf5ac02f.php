<p>Adesanya dominated Costa from start to finish in their Fight Island clash in Abu Dhabi</p>

<p>'Adesanya is human trash,' Costa wrote on Instagram. 'This has become a grave situation! I saw his disgusting action after fight and I will not stop until I have my revenge. <?php echo e('@'); ?>danawhite make this rematch happen.</p>

<p>'It turned into a matter of honour and I want the rematch immediately. Let's sort it out as it should be, life or death, 100% prepared. Dana White let's go.'</p>

<p>Costa was furious in the aftermath and says he will not stop until he gets his revenge</p>

<p>Adesanya celebrates the victory over Costa, which Dana White called 'Domination of the Year'</p>

<p>Costa was unbeaten going into the fight, but White said afterwards: 'So much for "Fight of the Year" â€“ it was "Domination of the Year".</p>

<p>'It was weird because if you look at every other fight that Costa has had, he comes out and goes after people like they owe him money.</p>

<p>'I think he landed one jab in this fight. He didnâ€™t try to clinch on the fence, didnâ€™t try to put pressure, kept going back to the centre of the octagon. It was very weird.'</p>

<p>Adesanya is now expected to move on to a fresh challenge from Jared Cannonier or another bout with Robert Whittaker.Â </p>
