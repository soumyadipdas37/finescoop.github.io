<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A dental surgery has been accused of 'profiting' after forcing patients to buy face masks and BANNING them from bringing their own.</p>

<p>The move has been branded 'disgraceful' by angry patients, who were told they could not wear their own masks for hygine reasons. </p>

<p>Instead they were reportedly told when making an appointment that they would have to purchase on at the surgery instead.  </p>

<p>Guildhall Dental in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, were slammed after selling masks to patients for £5 and banning them from using their own for 'hygine reasons'</p>

<p>Kevin Seggie, 58, said he was ‘completely outraged’ after his last two visits to Guildhall Dental, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. </p>

<p>“It just disgraceful,” said Mr Seggie, who lives in nearby Lawshall.</p>

<p>“I have been going to this surgery for more than 10 years but I won’t be going back.</p>

<p>“I was told I couldn’t bring my own face mask for hygiene reasons, and had to buy one of theirs, as they needed to make sure it was clean and new.</p>

<p>Faith Phillips, practice manager at Guildhall Dental, said they were not profiting off the masks and had introduced the temporary measure to cover spiralling costs of in-demand PPE</p>

<p>“The masks I have are exactly the same and I got 100 of them for £16. Charging £5 each is just profiteering when they cost just 16p.”</p>

<p>But the dentist surgery claims they are making no profits off the personal protective equipment (PPE), saying it reflects the rise in prices of the in demand products. </p>

<p>Mr Seggie made two visits to the dentist in the past month first for a check-up and a second to see the hygienist.</p>

<p>After his temperature was taken at the door he was sold a mask to wear in the waiting room.</p>

<p>“I was only waiting five minutes so that works out at £1 a minute,” added Mr Seggie.</p>

<p>“I am on a dental plan and no doubt this will be added to that. Other private patients have the cost added to the bill, I believe.</p>

<p>“I have around four dental visits a year and so that is £20. It doesn’t sound a lot but it is the principle as the dentist is making money out of coronavirus.”</p>

<p>Mr Seggie says he has also contacted Citizens Advice and Tradings Standards about the mask sales.</p>

<p>A sign on Guildhall Dental's Facebook page outlines how they are keeping patients safe and says patients will be 'offered hand sanitiser and a mask to wear' at appointments, but does not mention the £5 charge</p>

<p>Faith Phillips, practice manager at Guildhall Dental, said the charge for masks was a temporary measure in a bid to cover costs during lockdown measures.</p>

<p>She said: “The purpose of PPE is to protect both patients and the dental team from possible transmission of Covid-19.</p>

<p>“We are hopeful that this will only be for a few months but we need to comply with instruction from Public Health England as to what is required to allow us to treat our patients. </p>

<p>'This PPE includes respirator masks, surgical gowns and visors.</p>

<p>“Given the current high demand for PPE and problems with supply, costs have risen very sharply, for example, surgical masks are now selling for 20-times their pre-Covid prices.</p>

<p>“We are supplying these surgical masks to all patients and the £5 charge is to contribute towards the significantly increased prices across a number of items used to keep our staff safe, as well as patients. We are making no profit on them.</p>

<p>“We are hopeful that as supplies of PPE increase we will be able to reduce the level of charge and once the risk of Covid-19 transmission falls, eliminate it altogether.”</p>
