<p>Alex Hooper, a 34-year-old comic from Los Angeles, compared the former Modern Family star's look to that of a rodeo clown, and said her makeup looked like 'a drunk drag queen' did it.</p>

<p>He also told Howie Mandel, 64, that he resembled 'a turtle who's been burned alive,' and joked about show host Terry Crews, 52, being so old he was 'Ancient Spice.'</p>

<p>Insulting comic: Sofia Vergara was horribly roasted during a comic's insulting singing routine on Tuesday's quarterfinals episode of America's Got Talent on NBC</p>

<p>To Heidi Klum, 47, he cracked, 'Heidi, you're a wonderful mother; it's easy to see. At least that's what your six nannies were paid to tell me.'</p>

<p>'Eight,' Heidi returned, holding up eight fingers.</p>

<p>'You're direct from the heavens,' Alex continued. 'You make angels sing. You used to fly among them until they clipped your wings.'</p>

<p>Heidi walked the runway as a Victoria's Secret angel from age 24 to 37, and left in 2010.</p>

<p>Comedy routine: Alex Hooper, a 34-year-old comic from Los Angeles, compared the former Modern Family star's look to that of a rodeo clown, and said her makeup looked like 'a drunk drag queen' did it</p>

<p>The judges: Heidi Klum, Howie Mandel and Sofia judged the acts during the live show on NBC</p>

<p>The host: Terry Crews hosted the two-hour show</p>

<p>Alex, however, reserved his nastiest digs for Sofia, 48, saying, 'Who did your makeup, a drunk drag queen?' which earned him boos and a 'whoa, whoa, whoa,' from Terry.</p>

<p>'When Hollywood kicks you out, don't let it get you down,' Alex told the Colombian actress. 'You'll always have work as a rodeo clown.'</p>

<p>The contestant went on to tell absent judge Simon Cowell, 60, 'May your recovery be as speedy as that electric bike you had no business riding.'</p>

<p>Original song: Alex reserved his nastiest digs for Sofia, 48, saying, 'Who did your makeup, a drunk drag queen?' which earned him boos and a 'whoa, whoa, whoa,' from Terry</p>

<p>Rodeo clown: 'When Hollywood kicks you out, don't let it get you down,' Alex told the Colombian actress. 'You'll always have work as a rodeo clown'</p>

<p>'Simon, you have a young son,' he added. 'Your life took a turn! When he graduates, you'll be front-row, in a beautiful urn.'</p>

<p>Alex concluded his act by praising the show's iconic cast, but said he'd returned to AGT 'to burn it to the ground,' telling America to vote for him as it would get 'better next round.'</p>

<p>Howie was the only judge to give him a standing ovation, telling Alex he was 'brilliant' and comparing him to the great insult comic Don Rickles, who died in 2017 at age 90.</p>

<p>Loved it: Howie was the only judge to give him a standing ovation, telling Alex he was 'brilliant' and comparing him to the great insult comic Don Rickles, who died in 2017 at age 90</p>

<p>Asked what she thought, Sofia said she had no problem with Alex, but her issue was with Howie.</p>

<p>The Canadian judge had pooh-poohed a number of inoffensive acts during the season 15 episode, upsetting his fellow judges, yet he clapped for the man who 'burned' them.</p>

<p>'The whole night he's been so negative, and suddenly this guy comes and destroys us and he's clapping!' Sofia emphasized, admitting that she had nonetheless found Alex amusing.</p>

<p>So negative: 'The whole night he's been so negative, and suddenly this guy comes and destroys us and he's clapping!' Sofia emphasized, admitting that she had nonetheless found Alex amusing</p>

<p>'You're horrific,' she told Alex, pressing her red 'X' buzzer. 'You're so mean! But you're funny.'</p>

<p>Heidi's review was terse: 'Roses are red, violets are blue. Some people are funny. Not sure about you.'</p>

<p>Just five of the 11 acts who performed on Tuesday's quarterfinals would go through to AGT's semifinals and earn the chance to compete for $1 million and their own Las Vegas show.</p>

<p>Terse review: Heidi's review was terse: 'Roses are red, violets are blue. Some people are funny. Not sure about you'</p>

<p>Selfie time: Sofia took a selfie that Heidi and Howie photobombed</p>

<p>Some of the performers' chances were bound to be affected by Howie's responses, as the typically tough judge once again critiqued a number of acts.</p>

<p>The two-hour show opened well, as the C.A. Wildcats, a cheerleading team from Plano, Texas, unveiled a series of lightning-fast splits, cartwheels and pyramids.</p>

<p>'What an amazing job you guys did to start the show like that!' Heidi raved. 'You guys are so full of energy… you're like a soda that you shake, and it just goes pow!'</p>

<p>Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, then played a heartfelt song on piano that she'd written for her little sister, Alexis.</p>

<p>Alexis, like much of Kenadi's family, suffered from a degenerative eye condition that might one day leave her blind—and Kenadi made a special gesture to her at the end of her song.</p>

<p>Heidi openly admired Kenadi's talent, telling her the 'music world' would soon call for her.</p>

<p>Teen talent: Kenadi Dodds, a 15-year-old singer from North Logan, Utah, then played a heartfelt song on piano that she'd written for her little sister, Alexis</p>

<p>But Howie earned loud boos from the in-house audience by saying, 'I have to be honest—that song didn't do it for me, personally. If you remove what the story is about…'</p>

<p>'He's always like that, he never likes original songs,' Heidi noted, as Howie said, 'Hey, I gave a Golden Buzzer to Grace VanderWaal,' the 16-year-old singer who won season 11 of AGT.</p>

<p>The crowd booed more loudly.</p>

<p>Live show: The live show was filmed in Los Angeles amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>'Please, people, please!' Howie yelled, looking angry. 'Enough!'</p>

<p>Asked what she'd thought of Kenadi's song, Sofia told the girl she was 'amazing,' and said that Howie was 'being very negative today.'</p>

<p>'You liked that song as much as the first one?' Howie pressed Sofia, who conceded that she'd hadn't, leading him to shout, 'Ha! Ha! Ha!'</p>

<p>Virtual audience: A virtual audience was shown on video boards</p>

<p>The next act didn't fare much better.</p>

<p>Romania's Lightwave Theatre Company had fought hard to prepare for the live show, as a police-enforced lockdown in their country left them just two weeks to rehearse. </p>

<p>Their  moving, adversity-defying act imagined two strangers forging a connection with animals during a pandemic with the tagline, 'Be there for each other.' </p>

<p>Tough time: Romania's Lightwave Theatre Company had fought hard to prepare for the live show, as a police-enforced lockdown in their country left them just two weeks to rehearse</p>

<p>Howie gave the group an 'X' from his red buzzer while watching them.</p>

<p>'Howie, what is it you didn't like?' Terry asked him.</p>

<p>'I found that very depressing,' Howie declared, acknowledging that he knew he'd been 'on this stick tonight,' but he wanted people to up their game in the semifinals.</p>

<p>'I loved what I saw you do with the dog and the puppets the first time you were on the stage,' he told the group. 'It's the same dog, it's kind of the same puppets, with a very depressing—I don't even know what the message is… Give somebody a puppy and the COVID will go away?'</p>

<p>Staying positive: Terry stayed upbeat while Howie was being critical of the acts</p>

<p>'I can tell you what the message is,' Heidi interjected, as the in-house audience began to boo Howie again. 'It's about doing something nice for someone else.'</p>

<p>'Enough already!' Howie yelled to the crowd.</p>

<p>Heidi pointed out that the act provided 'a nice message' to lonely people during the pandemic, but Sofia understood Howie's point, and admitted that the group's first try was better.</p>

<p>Resound, a musical trio from Richmond, Virginia, did a lovely cover of Andrea Bocelli's Fall On Me, which got slightly more praise from Howie than the previous acts.</p>

<p>Sweet cover: Resound, a musical trio from Richmond, Virginia, did a lovely cover of Andrea Bocelli's Fall On Me, which got slightly more praise from Howie than the previous acts</p>

<p>He called the group's work 'beautiful,' but still hedged his bets, adding, 'You want those moments where people say, ''Honey, get in here! You gotta hear this! You gotta see this!'' You have those moments, but you had them before. Did you give us more? I don't know.'</p>

<p>He also was unmoved by Broken Roots, a Chicago-based guitar duo who did a cover of U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.</p>

<p>'You rose to the occasion,' he said. 'My question is it big stage AGT, worthy of live shows, or is it great coffeehouse music?'</p>

<p>Not moved: Howie also was unmoved by Broken Roots, a Chicago-based guitar duo who did a cover of U2's I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For</p>

<p>The comedian finally changed his tune when Divas And Drummers Of Compton, from Compton, California, appeared with a lively dance act from a football field back home.</p>

<p>During auditions, Howie had told them, 'You are what this show is about,' and he backed it up on Tuesday, telling them to cheers that they had been his favorite act of the night.</p>

<p>'I love the whole production, and apparently, I love the reproduction, too,' he told the group, which was led by a visibly pregnant dancer.</p>

<p>Singer Celina Graves, 30, from San Diego, then earned applause for her chill-inducing vocals on London Grammar's Strong, with Heidi calling her performance 'flawless.'</p>

<p>Noah Epps, a 12-year-old dancer from Ashburn, Virginia, also blew the judges away with his act, which saw him moving around brokenly as a character from a scary movie.</p>

<p>'I feel like so many will copy what you just did,' Heidi told Noah, comparing him to dancer Maddie Ziegler, 17. 'I think you're incredible.'</p>

<p>The Bello Sisters, a trio of Italian acrobats aged 13, 19, and 22, made the judges gasp with their act, which found them balancing on each other as Bishop Brigg's White Flag played.</p>

<p>The episode and the last quarterfinals ended with a performance by poet Brandon Leake, 27, from Stockton, California, who'd won Howie's Golden Buzzer during the audition rounds.</p>

<p>Howie urged America to 'sit quietly, listen, take it in,' as Brandon recited his poem about his mother's love and how hard it was to raise a Black son safely in America.</p>

<p>Mouth covered: Sofia gasped and covered her mouth while watching the Bello Sisters perform</p>

<p>The judge looked shaken up by the poem, and all three of them gave Brandon a standing ovation.</p>

<p>'This is above and beyond anything I've ever seen, anything I've ever heard,' Howie told him. 'You took an older white guy and put me into the body of an African-American mother just hoping that her son survives life.'</p>

<p>'I am so proud to be here in this room,' he continued. 'I am so proud that I pushed the Golden Buzzer. In my heart, you just won the whole night. You really did.'</p>

<p>America's Got Talent will air its results show Wednesday on NBC.</p>
