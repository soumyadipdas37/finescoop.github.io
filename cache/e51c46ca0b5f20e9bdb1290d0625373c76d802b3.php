<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Conor Gallagher is poised to join West Brom from Chelsea on a season’s loan following a series of phone calls between Slaven Bilic and Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>As reported by Sportsmail last Thursday, the 20-year-old midfielder was prominent on Albion’s radar in the build-up to the new campaign and Albion manager Bilic’s relationship with Blues boss Lampard – the pair were team-mates at West Ham in 1996-97 – helped tip the balance in West Brom’s favour.</p>

<p>Bilic and Lampard are believed to spoken three times last week about Gallagher, who is expected to sign a new deal with the Blues before completing his switch.</p>

<p>Conor Gallagher is expected to sign a new deal with Chelsea before joining West Brom on loan</p>

<p>The England Under 21 star could make his Baggies debut as early as this weekend</p>

<p>Gallagher, who had also attracted attention from Crystal Palace and Leeds, could make his Baggies debut at Everton on Saturday.</p>

<p>Bilic remains desperate for Albion to make more signings ahead of the window closing next month, and he hopes to seal the capture of former Chelsea centre-back Branislav Ivanovic on a free transfer.</p>

<p>The Croatian would also like a pacy centre-forward although Albion’s attempts to sign Karlan Grant from Huddersfield have so far been frustrated by the Championship club’s £17million asking price.</p>

<p>West Brom boss Slaven Bilic has been pushing for more signings in this transfer window</p>

<p>Gallagher has never played in the Premier League but was impressive on loan at Charlton and Swansea last term.</p>

<p>His versatility should also come in useful to Albion, who went into the opening game of the campaign with a squad that was barely stronger than the one promoted from the Championship at the end of July. They were beaten 3-0 at home by Leicester.</p>

<p>Albion have secured permanent deals for three of last season’s four loan stars, Grady Diangana, Matheus Pereira and Callum Robinson. But a move for a fourth, Filip Krovinovic, is currently stalling over the terms of his proposed loan deal from Benfica.</p>
