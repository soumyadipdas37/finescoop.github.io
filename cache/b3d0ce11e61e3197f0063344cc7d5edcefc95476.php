<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Neymar's shock switch to become the new face of Puma has reportedly come with a massive £23m-per-year deal - the largest individual sponsorship contract in sport.   </p>

<p>The 28-year-old ended his close partnership with Nike this month, quitting the American brand after they backed his rise from the age of 13.</p>

<p>The PSG forward had two years left on an 11-year deal with Nike - choosing to break the contract to make history with a staggering sum.  </p>

<p>Neymar's brand new Puma deal has helped him get one over Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi</p>

<p>The Brazilian broke off his 15-year Nike partnership to joint he German brand this month </p>

<p>The £23m Neymar will earn annually from Puma puts him above Messi's £18m Adidas deal </p>

<p>Neymar's £23m-a-year crushes Cristiano Ronaldo's £15m Nike deal by a massive £8m, while Lionel Messi's £18m Adidas partnership is also dwarfed by the Brazilian's. </p>

<p>The huge sums were revealed by Forbes but the length of the deal is unknown, as Neymar settles into life as the face of the German brand, wearing Puma boots, lifestyle wear and training gear. </p>

<p>Puma's signing was announced with the slogan 'The King is back', referencing the company's iconic Puma KING boot.    </p>

<p>Ronaldo's £15m Nike deal is also put into the shade by Neymar's massive new partnership </p>

<p>Neymar insisted Puma's history was also an important factor in the Nike break: 'I grew up watching videos of great football legends such as Pele, Cruyff, Matthaus, Eusebio and Maradona.' </p>

<p>'I wish to bring back the legacy that those athletes created on the pitch.'  </p>

<p>PSG are sponsored by Nike and the American company will be disappointed to lose the superstar, but the Parisians will still be delighted that Neymar has committed his future to the club, for now. </p>

<p>The Brazilian will hope Puma KINGs will finally carry him to Champions League glory in 2021</p>

<p>The Brazilian confirmed he will be staying in France this season, with the winger still chasing the Champions League glory he was brought in to achieve back in 2017. </p>

<p>Neymar helped PSG to the final in 2020 but a 1-0 scoreline in Bayern Munich's favour hid the ease of the German's victory, after a poor display from the Ligue 1 side's talisman.  </p>
