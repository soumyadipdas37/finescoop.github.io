<p>50 Cent's advice: 'He said, "Don't ever feel too entitled to anything, because that's when you deprive yourself". So I always keep that in mind,' Michael, who plays Tariq St. Patrick on Power revealed in an interview with Daily Mail Australia </p>

<p>'Something he [50 Cent] told me when we were filming season three, when Kanan and Tariq first started hanging out, has always stuck with me,' Michael said.</p>

<p>'He said, "Don't ever feel too entitled to anything, because that's when you deprive yourself". So I always keep that in mind. </p>

<p>'Or don't think something is always supposed to go your way, because that's when you deprive yourself and make the situation even worse,' he continued.    </p>
