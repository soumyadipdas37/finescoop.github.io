<p>Working out: The mother-of-two, 34, who gave birth to her daughter Gigi in July, looked sensational in a black sports bra which she teamed with a pair of leggings</p>

<p>Hard at work: Vogue showcased her fitness prowess as she practiced a series of movements including lunges and squats using a purple resistance band</p>

<p>Vogue gave birth to Gigi Margaux on July 23 with husband Spencer, 33, and the couple welcomed their first child, son Theodore in September 2018. </p>

<p>Spencer confirmed earlier this week that he and Vogue will be having more kids in the future, only if she allows him to hire a live-in nanny.</p>

<p>During the first episode of their eponymous podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents. </p>

<p>Responding to fans' queries about growing their family, presenter Vogue confirmed: 'Yes we will be. Not yet though', before the reality star added: 'Depending on the nanny's availability and whether or not she can move in permanently. I won't do it otherwise.' </p>

<p>Vogue shared the details of their agreement as she said: 'Spenny did actually say that, that we could have four kids if I swore that we could have a live-in nanny by the time we had four kids. </p>

<p>Fresh-faced: The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades</p>

<p>'It's different for Irish people I think because we don't do the whole night nanny thing, and all that stuff, you don't hear about that at home, but here, you have maternity nurses, night nannies and stuff like that and we just don't have that.' </p>

<p>Spencer left his long-term partner in giggles as he joked he'd wear 'condoms every time' if she tries to have a third baby without a live-in nanny, with the blonde sarcastically replying: 'Good luck, I'd be really into that, we can start doing that right now because I'd rather not go on the pill.'</p>

<p>When asked whether they currently receive help with their children, the former Lothario said: 'Yes, obviously.   </p>

<p>'And it's not even a pompous like, obviously, it's how can two adults who work, full time, look after kids as well. It's a necessity, of day to day life. If one of us didn't work, then we wouldn't have a nanny, given that we work.  </p>

<p>'Without being rude but I don't compare myself to other people. I have my mission in life and the things I want to achieve, and a nanny is very much a part of that.'</p>

<p>'But if you saw me complaining online, about being a mum and having a job… what would you think about me?', the mother-of-two asked, with the TV star replying: 'I'd say why don't you get the nanny to do more?' </p>
