<p>The 56-year-old revealed on the Rachael Ray Show today that she has knitted several items in the past few months, including hats for her husband and some mismatched mitten for her oldest daughter, Malia.</p>

<p>But finding a tutor when you're internationally famous can be a bit tricky, so Mrs. Obama admitted that she's been using a pseudonym to communicate with other knitters online. </p>

<p>Quaran-hobby! Former First Lady Michelle Obama says she has taken up knitting during quarantine</p>

<p>The 56-year-old said: 'I have knitted a blanket, like five scarves, three halter tops, a couple of hats for Barack, and I just finished my first pair of mittens for Malia'</p>

<p>'I’ve started knitting,' she said. 'Over the course of this quarantine, I have knitted a blanket, like five scarves, three halter tops, a couple of hats for Barack, and I just finished my first pair of mittens for Malia. </p>

<p>'One is twice as big as the other,' she added. 'I’m still working on my stitching gauge.'</p>

<p>While she has joined an online community for knitters, she's been careful to keep her identity a secret.</p>

<p>'They don’t know I’m in the knitting community because I don’t use my real name, but I have some knitting, you know, tutors who I kind of go through to get my yarn and my patterns and all that,' she said.</p>

<p>Quarantine has helped her find a newfound interest in knitting, but it's also had some downsides.   </p>

<p>The former First Lady admitted that while the beginning of family lockdown time was 'lovely,' her husband and daughters started to occasionally get on her nerves after a while.</p>

<p>Secret club: She said she uses a fake name in knitting communities but 'I have some knitting tutors who I kind of go through to get my yarn and my patterns and all that'</p>

<p>'Quarantine started out so lovely. There was the first phase when we were all together, and we’d go apart, and then we’d come together,' she said</p>

<p>'It’s really interesting, because sometimes Barack just comes into the room, and I’m in the middle of something, and he’s like, "What are you doing?"</p>

<p>'And I’m like — "Nothing. Nothing. Just please go." Sometimes you just don’t want to talk. You’re not ready for a check-in when they are. So, yeah. </p>

<p>'Quarantine started out so lovely. There was the first phase when we were all together, and we’d go apart, and then we’d come together… then right around June, all that magic started wearing off. </p>

<p>'So, yes. Barack Obama is a wonderful man, but he is still a man,' she said.</p>

<p>Of course, the pandemic has brought challenges for everyone, and Michelle said it's likely been especially eye-opening for young people.  </p>

<p>'We’ve taught our kids you can make a plan, and if you execute it, this and that will happen. Well, we know as we get older that life throws you a whole bunch of curves,' she said.</p>

<p>Solitude is nice, too! Around June, though, some of the 'magic' of family time all the time started to wear off, and her husband has occasionally gotten on her nerves </p>

<p>She said: 'Barack Obama is a wonderful man, but he is still a man'</p>

<p>'There are a lot of things outside your control. Learning to embrace that without letting it suffocate, learning how to be flexible with life, learning that there is no one way to live this life right…</p>

<p>'I’m hoping through our conversations with our young people that we’re helping them through this, and giving understanding that this is what resilience is. This thing we talk about is being able to push through even when things are tough. When things don’t work out as you planned, to find a way to reshape and reimagine.'</p>

<p>During her appearance on the show, the Harvard Law School graduate also touched on the importance of voting.</p>

<p>'We just don't have those discussions anymore about the importance of voting. A lot of civics classes have been taken out of the curriculum. </p>

<p>'A lot of young people aren't being raised with a conversation about our democratic process and understanding how our democracy works, and the three branches of government, and state and federal separation of powers, and what the Supreme Court stands for,' she said.</p>

<p>Civic duty: During her appearance on the show, the Harvard Law School graduate also touched on the importance of voting</p>

<p>'So many people don’t know because we haven’t made it a priority like we did growing up.</p>

<p>'I’m 56, and I remember voting with my father, who voted in every single election. My father had MS. That meant he could only get around with the assistance of a cane or crutches, and later he was on a motorized cart. Even as he struggled to walk down to a polling place that wasn’t necessarily suited for somebody with a disability, my father never missed an election ever, ever.</p>

<p>'I remember voting with him when we were little, and they had the machines with the little levers that you click. It would close the curtain and I thought, "Oh my God, this is such an awesome responsibility, and my father is taking this incredibly seriously." When it was time for me to vote, I did it with enthusiasm and pride.' </p>
