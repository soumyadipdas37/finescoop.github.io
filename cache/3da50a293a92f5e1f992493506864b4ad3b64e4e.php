<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Like all industries the fashion world has had to adapt to the new normal.</p>

<p>So while London Fashion Week did take place, it was a very different affair with very few catwalk shows.</p>

<p>Instead we saw digital shows or socially distanced showroom presentations.</p>

<p>But it didn't stop the fashion pack from showing off their front row worthy looks and we've picked out some of our favourites from the capital.</p>

<p>After all, who better to be inspired by than the women who live and breathe fashion? </p>

<p>Check them out... And why not steal their style this season?</p>

<p>The dresses </p>

<p>Dresses were in full flight at London Fashion Week</p>

<p>We've been enjoying some seriously lovely weather so it's no surprise our fashionable friends weren't covered up in winter coats and scarves.</p>

<p>In fact, many of them made the most of the sunny days in fabulous dresses which required no cover ups or layering. </p>

<p>Midis are still a huge look and we love the colourful displays these beauties put on for us. From burnt orange to ditsy florals to a frothy pastel confection, these frocks were made to be seen.</p>

<p>Whites dresses were everywhere at London Fashion Week</p>

<p>In complete contrast, however, were the stylistas who opted to wear white.</p>

<p>Who can blame them when it could be the last chance to make the most of a late summer tan... </p>

<p>Ladies in leather </p>

<p>Leather is BIG for AW20 so no wonder these fashion mavens were wearing it</p>

<p>We saw lots of luxe leather looks at New York Fashion Week so we were expecting something similar on this side of the pond.</p>

<p>And that's what we got.</p>

<p>Leather trousers, jackets and skirts were spotted at regular intervals and we love how these trousers have been styled with a simple white tee, while this mini skirt looks fab with the contrasting herringbone blazer and those sexy knee high boots.</p>

<p>New tailoring</p>

<p>Contemporary tailoring seen on the streets at London Fashion Week </p>

<p>And again, much like in New York, tailoring made itself known with interesting takes on a classic look.</p>

<p>We love this slightly more casual take on a skirt suit, especially the way it has been styled with a white tee, chunky loafers and a pair of white sports socks. We're SO into this look!</p>

<p>And how about this oversized, sleeveless tuxedo jacket? Worn with baggy jeans it's playing with contrasts as well as proportions, and for that we salute the ultra chic woman who pulled this ensemble together. </p>

<p>On yer bike! </p>

<p>Cycling shorts and chunky boots? Yes please!</p>

<p>One of the more perplexing trends of recent years is the styling of cycling shorts when nowhere near a bicycle.</p>

<p>We have to say, at first we couldn't really get our heads around it.</p>

<p>But then you see stylish people making it look amazing and slowly your mind starts to change and you think, 'yeah, sure, why not?' </p>

<p>These two beauties are very good examples and please note how they both rocked them with a leather blazer and chunky boots. </p>

<p>That's our styling lesson for today. </p>

<p>Midi skirt mavens </p>

<p>Midi skirts = autumnal perfection</p>

<p>Like midi dresses, midi skirts were also a favourite this Fashion Week.</p>

<p>And like midi dresses, they can be worn well into winter so are definitely worth investing in.</p>

<p>This slinky silk blue skirt elevates an otherwise simple black top and flats, while this beige skirt adds a bit of utility edge to proceedings. </p>

<p>At Very you'll find everything you need for a new season style overhaul and getting the London Fashion Week street style look is easy too.</p>

<p>The dresses </p>

<p>L-R: Nobodys Child Leana Maxi Dress (£35) and In The Style X Jac Jossa V Neck Trapeze Dress (£30) at Very</p>

<p>Autumn dresses are a must and we love this pretty pastel pink printed look by Nobody's Child. It'll look ace with ankle boots or trainers this season.</p>

<p>Or why not work white in this cute smock dress from Jac Jossa's range for In The Style? Simple but effective.</p>

<p>Ladies in leather </p>

<p>L-R: V by Very Faux Leather Girlfriend Straight Trousers (£32) and Ted Baker A Line Leather Mini Skirt (£150) at Very</p>

<p>Leather, whether real or faux, is always a good idea.</p>

<p>V by Very's straight leg trousers will help you get that fashion editor look that nails effortless polish, or Ted Baker's mini skirt will look great with opaque black tights and boots.</p>

<p>New tailoring</p>

<p>L-R: River Island Pocket Detail Blazer (£55) and Quiz Wrap PU Lapel Tuxedo Bodysuit (£25) at Very</p>

<p>A blazer is a wardrobe essential. In fact, you can never have too many so why not add this beige version by River Island to your arsenal? Wear over a white tee and jeans for a classic off-duty outfit.</p>

<p>And get the tuxedo look with this brilliant bodysuit by Quiz. Work it under denim or leather for a chic alternative to a little black dress.</p>

<p> On yer bike!</p>

<p>L-R: adidas Originals R.Y.V Cycling Shorts (£25) and Dr Martens 8 Eye Patent Ankle Boots (£139) at Very</p>

<p>Ready to try the cycling shorts trend?</p>

<p>This pair by adidas will look rather fabulous with a pair of patent Dr Martens boots.</p>

<p>Midi skirt mavens </p>

<p>L-R: Ted Baker Spot Fabric Midi Skirt (was £99, now £49.50) and Topshop Pocket Midi Skirt (was £35, now £19.15) at Very</p>

<p>And add a midi skirt to your wish list too.</p>

<p>Go slinky with Ted Baker's blue spot style or Topshop's utility skirt keeps things casual.</p>

<p>Wear both with a soft, oversized knit and white trainers this autumn.</p>
