<p>'To the lady that posted about cleaning her oven racks in the bath tub with washing powder, thank you! I have never been able to get mine so clean ever before!' one woman said and shared images on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I cannot thank you enough for making this daunting task so simple!'</p>

<p>To clean the oven racks, she placed a towel at the bottom of the bathtub to prevent scratches, then laid the oven racks on top before adding the water and detergent. </p>

<p>The strong ingredients in the laundry powder remove tough food stains and grease.  </p>

<p>Hundreds were impressed with the simple hack and many who had previously used the laundry detergent said it 'works wonders'. </p>
