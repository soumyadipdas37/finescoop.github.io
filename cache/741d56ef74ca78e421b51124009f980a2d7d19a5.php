<p>The 70-year-old said the growth of websites and social media has made bosses increasingly concerned with image.</p>

<p>Miss Purves, who has presented on Radio 4 for 40 years, said she resented the fact men 'get away with it' – no matter their age or looks. </p>

<p>Broadcaster Libby Purves, 70, has claimed that the BBC won't let female radio presenters become 'grey and stout' as its stations are becoming ageist and sexist</p>

<p>Miss Purves said the growth of websites and social media has made bosses more concerned with image. It comes after the BBC axed Sue Barker, 64, (above) as A Question Of Sport host</p>

<p>Miss Purves said that in the past 'you could get older unless your voice actually quavered and your phrases and opinions marked you out as an old buffer'.</p>

<p>'But the coming of websites [and] social media... is making radio seek an image more visual, thus ageist,' she told Radio Times. </p>

<p>'The middle-aged female must struggle to look youthful... Equality will come when women are allowed to be grey, stout and in proper cardigans.' </p>

<p>She added: 'On TV it has always mattered, and annoyed older women.</p>

<p>'It's a visual medium, far more tolerant of verbal mediocrity than radio, and frankly all sexes enjoy looking at prettiness, slenderness, abundant blonde hair and a good leg.</p>

<p>'Observe that of the over-50 women above, most look far younger. And they work on it. The men don't have to.'</p>

<p>Miss Purves's comments came after Jenni Murray, 70, (above) and Jane Garvey, 56, announced that they were leaving Radio 4's Woman's Hour this year</p>

<p>The former presenter of BBC Radio 4's Midweek added: 'In radio, age never used to matter a jot… We resisted the visual and grumped at photographers.</p>

<p>'When they put a webcam in her studio, Jenni Murray famously draped a pashmina over it.</p>

<p>'When radio presenters met people, we were usually told "I'd imagined you taller - and thinner"… The nearly 50-something Zoe Ball flicks designedly youthful hair, Lauren Laverne looks 25, not 42, and Mishal Husain is basically a goddess anyway.</p>

<p>'If there's a grudge to be grudged, it's that the chaps of all ages can inform, educate and entertain while looking like Benny Hill or Old Steptoe - and get away with it.</p>

<p>'It's not all about numbers.'</p>
