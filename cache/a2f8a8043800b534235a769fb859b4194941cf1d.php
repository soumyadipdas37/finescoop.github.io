<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sheffield United are exploring the possibility of signing free agent striker Daniel Sturridge.</p>

<p>Manager Chris Wilder desperately wants to add a striker to his squad and has been in negotiations with Liverpool and Arsenal over deals for Rhian Brewster and Folarin Balogun respectively.</p>

<p>However, the Bramall Lane club have been struggling to match their valuations and have had offers knocked back while also asking for possible loan deals.</p>

<p>Sheffield United are considering moving for free agent Daniel Sturridge this summer </p>

<p>The former Liverpool star is a free agent and has been keeping fit with a personal trainer </p>

<p>The 31-year-old has been keeping fit with a personal trainer and training at non-league Kidsgrove Athletic near his home. He is free after leaving Trabzonspor earlier in the year and has attracted attention from clubs who recognise that if fit he can still make a contribution in the top flight.</p>

<p>He scored seven goals in 16 appearances for Trabzonspor before mutually cancelling his contract ahead of receiving a four month worldwide ban for breach of betting regulations. </p>

<p>That ban ended a couple of months ago. So now the former England international is free and available to get back on with his career with the case now behind him.</p>

<p>Sturridge feels he has unfinished business in the Premier League after leaving Liverpool and has been working hard to get himself in shape for a return.</p>

<p>Sheffield United's tough start to the 2020-21 season has highlighted their need for signings</p>

<p>United manager Chris Wilder said: 'I have consistently said right the way through that at the top of the pitch we need to improve and that doesn't change.</p>

<p>'I am sure the board share my desire to get one of these deals done. I have said all along in board meetings why we need to do it.</p>

<p>'I believe that they do want to improve and do want to fill that spot with a player.'</p>

<p>Sturridge has also had interest from Aston Villa who, along with Crystal Palace, remain in the race to sign Liverpool's Brewster. The 20-year-old is valued at £25m and Liverpool want a buy-back clause.</p>

<p>Sturridge's vast experience at club and international level could prove to be essential </p>
