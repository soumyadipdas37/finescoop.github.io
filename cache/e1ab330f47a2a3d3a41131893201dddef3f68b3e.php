<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A terrified Amazon delivery driver had to leap over a customer's fence in California to escape a dog - before he realized the 13-stone giant just wanted to say hello.</p>

<p>The hilarious moment happened as the Amazon driver pulled up to Allan and Meredith Anderson's house in Temecula and did not take much notice of the beware of the dog notice on the gate.</p>

<p>CCTV footage from September 10 shows the worker strolling carefree up towards the front door.</p>

<p>He suddenly sprints back into view before vaulting the perimeter fence of the house like an Olympic hurdler. </p>

<p>Close behind him is Winston, an English mastiff weighing 180lbs, who runs up to the fence before he halts and wags his tail like crazy. </p>

<p>The three-year-old dog turns away from the fence and, in the video, the driver can be seen smiling widely while catching his breath. </p>

<p>In his bid for freedom the Amazon worker cleared the white wooden fence</p>

<p>Now clearly comfortable that Winston has got nothing but playful thoughts the laughing delivery man walks back towards the Anderson's fence.</p>

<p>At this point Meredith, 51, an animal health saleswoman walks over and collects the parcel. </p>

<p>Meredith Anderson appears to see what the commotion was about</p>

<p>Allan, 56, a real estate agent, said: 'We were just completely shocked, especially that he didn't say anything to us.</p>

<p>'We couldn't believe what happened and how high he could jump.</p>

<p>'Once we realized nobody was hurt, we did laugh to ourselves. It looked like the delivery driver got a kick out of it actually.</p>

<p>'Meredith was taking some trash out from the front door and Winston just ran out. You can't see the gate from our door so she didn't know what happened.</p>

<p>'She was wondering why the delivery driver was on the opposite side of the driveway, panting and smiling to himself.</p>

<p>'She just said to him: 'he's just a big, friendly puppy dog, sorry if he startled you'.</p>

<p>'It wasn't until Meredith mentioned how weird the situation was that we decided to watch the security footage back.</p>

<p>'When you open the front door, he just wants to run out and see what's going on. He's just so friendly.</p>

<p>'Even at 180lbs, Winston is still a lap dog. He's just a big softie but he is very athletic for an English mastiff.</p>

<p>'He is an absolute sweetheart. If the delivery driver had bent down to say hello afterwards, Winston would probably still be there licking his face.</p>

<p>'I am really glad nobody got hurt.' </p>

<p>Allan's footage has been uploaded to social media where it has been viewed more than five million times.</p>

<p>One commenter said: 'Looks like an NCAA steeplechase champion.'</p>

<p>Another person stated: 'Omg this is awesome! That guy probably just about had a heart attack.' </p>

<p>Another viewer joked: 'I couldn't have cleared the fence! He made it look so effortless. I wonder if it's part of Amazon's driver training.'</p>

<p>Amazon have been contacted for comment.</p>
