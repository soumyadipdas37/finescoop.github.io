<p>City and Napoli remain at an impasse over Koulibaly, with the Serie A side demanding more than £70m.</p>

<p>Manchester City are considering making a move for Sevilla central defender Jules Kounde</p>

<p>Guardiola admires Atletico’s Madrid’s Jose Gimenez but they insist he will only be sold for his buy out clause of £90m. </p>

<p>City are fielding interest from Galatasaray for veteran Fernandinho but Guardiola would rather the Brazilian remain at the Etihad Stadium.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old's current contract with City is set to expire at the end of June next year.</p>

<p>City have been targeting Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly but have been unable to secure a deal</p>
