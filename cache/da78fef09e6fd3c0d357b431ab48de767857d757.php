<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The first week of the NFL saw brilliance from Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson, while Aaron Rodgers showed the Green Bay front office why they drafted a quarterback.</p>

<p>Off the field, OBJ is unhappy in Cleveland (still) and is there a storm brewing in 'Tompa Bay?'</p>

<p>Here’s the good, the bad and the downright ugly ahead of week two.   </p>

<p>Heading into week two of the new season, Odell Beckham Jr is still unhappy at the Browns</p>

<p>Tom Brady was called out by his head coach in week one, but was it all just a planned stunt?</p>

<p>The Chiefs, Ravens, Seahawks, Green Bay and the Saints look like the leading lights, while the Titans and Bills picked up where they left off.</p>

<p>It’s only week one, so let’s not over-react, but the Jets looked mightily like the Jets, the Browns contrived to do ludicrous things on the field – while a surly Odell Beckham Jnr (who caught 3 of 10 for a meagre 22 yards) wants out.</p>

<p>‘Obviously, Sunday wasn’t what we wanted... but more game reps will be the way to go,' he said.</p>

<p>And then, like only the Lions can, the Lions found a way to lose. Despite making Mitchell Trubisky look like Joe Montana in the fourth quarter, with time dwindling away No 1 draft pick D’Andre Swift let the game-winning touchdown pass slip through his fingers.</p>

<p>WTF went on with the WFT? Trailing 17-0, Washington trampled Philadelphia, scoring 27 unanswered points and sacking Carson Wentz eight times.</p>

<p>While head coach Ron Rivera, who was diagnosed with cancer last month, received a precautionary IV, second-year quarterback Dwayne Haskins gave a rousing speech at half-time.</p>

<p>‘Pretty much the moral of the speech was, “We're home. We're the home team. They're the visitors. This is our house”,’ he said.</p>

<p>No 2 draft pick Chase Young looked like he had been giving NFL offensive lines nightmares for years and sealed the game with a strip-sack on Wentz late in the fourth quarter.</p>

<p>An intriguing test for Washington on Sunday with a trip to the Cardinals, who are over .500 for the first time since the 2015 season.</p>

<p>Tom Brady threw two interceptions for the first time since 2018 during defeat in New Orleans and was called out by head coach Bruce Arians.</p>

<p>It’s a storm in a teacup – Brett Favre suggests it was a planned move for the head coach to call out the 43-year-old in public – but it’s a new way of doing things for Brady.</p>

<p>‘Tom and I are fine,’ Arians said on Wednesday. ‘So I don’t really care what other people think. It’s just what he and I think. We left the stadium fine, we showed up today fine. So ain’t nothin’ to talk about.’</p>

<p>In Brady’s former haunt, there is a mutual appreciation society.</p>

<p>After easing the Patriots to victory in Miami, Bill Belichick said of Cam Newton: ‘He's a great teammate. He's earned everybody's respect daily.’</p>

<p>And Newton returned the favour, saying of Belichick: ‘He makes the smartest players more cerebral… He's the ultimate teacher and I just respect that.’</p>

<p>Let’s see what Belichick has to say after the Patriots’ trip to Seattle on Sunday.</p>

<p>No team with play-off aspirations wants to go 0-2.</p>

<p>The Shanahanigans continue in San Francisco. Jimmy Garoppolo looked shaky and hung George Kittle out to dry in the first-half, causing the tight end to injure his knee after catching a high ball. ‘He has to play better,’ head coach Mike Shanahan barked after the defeat by Arizona.</p>

<p>And cornerback Richard Sherman has been placed on IR. Luckily, the 49ers play the Jets. And then the Giants.</p>

<p>But in front of 2,500 fans, Lucas Oil Stadium hosts the NFL’s most desperate teams.</p>

<p>The Colts blew it against the Jaguars, with Philip Rivers throwing two interceptions</p>

<p>The Colts didn’t punt once but managed to blow it against Jacksonville. And after throwing two interceptions, Philip Rivers needs to be less of gung-ho gunslinger and more a game manager. After all, back-up Jacoby Brissett is on $15m a year.</p>

<p>They play the Minnesota Vikings, who conceded the most points in the Mike Zimmer era and the second most total yards (522) against Green Bay in an eerily quiet US Bank Stadium.</p>

<p>The offense didn’t show up and the defense spent 41min 16secs on the field. Plenty for Mike Zimmer to fix.</p>

<p>For all the talk of progress, Colin Kaepernick is still without a job and Cardinals safety Budda Baker revealed some direct messages he received from a supposed 49ers fan.</p>

<p>It was Baker who fairly tackled Kittle, causing the tight end to leave the field with a knee injury.</p>

<p>The messages were sent to Baker’s Instagram account and contain disturbing language. </p>

<p>The 49ers launched an investigation to identify the fan, and once the culprit is found, they will be banned ‘from all 49ers games and events’.</p>

<p>Budda Baker suffered horrendous abuse after a tackle cause George Kittle to leave the field</p>

<p>The Cowboys ditched the supposedly conservative Jason Garrett for Mike McCarthy and owner Jerry Jones was hoping to see a high-powered offense unleashed against the Giants.</p>

<p>But after failing to convert a fourth-and-3 from the Rams’ 11-yard line in the fourth quarter, McCarthy came under fire for not levelling the game with a field goal.</p>

<p>‘The conservative play there is to kick the field goal,’ McCarthy said after the game. ‘But I just felt really good about how we were moving the football.’</p>

<p>But perhaps we should look outside the goldfish bowl in Dallas, as former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky explains…</p>

<p>The 4th and 3 the <?php echo e('@'); ?>dallascowboys had a lot are blaming Schultz/CD/Dak—it’s none of them. The <?php echo e('@'); ?>RamsNFL made the play—and it’s a sick one. pic.twitter.com/bXx91xRaNH</p>

<p>It has been a typically turbulent week for kickers.</p>

<p>Stephen Gostkowski missed four kicks but managed to boot the winning field goal on his Titans debut.</p>

<p>After missing his two kicks against Baltimore - an extra point and field goal - the Browns waived kicker Austin Seibert and signed Cody ‘double doink’ Parker.</p>

<p>The Bengals had kicking issues of their own during defeat by the Chargers and cut kicker Randy Bullock.</p>

<p>To replace him, they picked up Seibert. And in serendipitous style, the Bengals travel to Cleveland to kick off week two.</p>
