<p>Bye! Lindsay Lohan was unable to return to Down Under to resume her role as a judge on The Masked Singer Australia this year, due to coronavirus restrictions. After departing the show, she unfollowed her co-stars on social media - including comedian Dave Hughes (pictured) </p>

<p>Speaking to The Herald Sun on Tuesday, the TV star said: 'I know what it's like if you're on a TV show and then you're not for whatever reason and you see people on that show you were on having fun. </p>

<p>'You don't want to see that, it's annoying. So I absolutely understand,' he insisted, adding that he would do the same in her situation. </p>

<p>However Dave admitted he had begged Lindsay to re-follow him after realising he'd been dropped by the Hollywood star - but she ignored him. </p>

<p>It's okay! Jackie (pictured) was also sympathetic about the former child star's decision. She said: 'I think the reason she might have unfollowed us is that she doesn't want to see all The Masked Singer stuff because she really did want to be a part of it' </p>
