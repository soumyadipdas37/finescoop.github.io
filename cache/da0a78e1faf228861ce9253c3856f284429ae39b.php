<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>National League clubs have received an offer of financial aid from the Government which will help them start the season this weekend.</p>

<p>The future of the three leagues - the National League, the National League North and the National League South - had been in serious doubt after plans to allow spectators into grounds were shelved last week.</p>

<p>The 2020-21 season is due to begin on Saturday, but it was feared that without Government intervention many of the 67 clubs could have faced financial ruin if they did not have matchday revenue to rely on.</p>

<p>National League clubs are to receive government funding to allow their season to commence</p>

<p>Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden is overseeing a Government bail-out to aid non-league clubs</p>

<p>Several clubs were vocal in their calls for a Government rescue package and talks with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) over a bailout have been fruitful, with money due to be sent over before the weekend.</p>

<p>Earlier this week a letter co-signed by 17 individuals including former Football Association chairmen Greg Dyke and Lord Triesman and BBC and BT Sport pundit Robbie Savage said help was urgently needed to ward off the threat of financial collapse. </p>

<p>The letter, sent to Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned:  'Without any plans being made to rescue clubs, many in the EFL and others in the National League as well, are now actively preparing to make all but essential staff redundant, cease playing, close down their youth academies and community foundations, and put their business into administration,' the letter warns.</p>

<p>The delayed return of fans to stadiums has hit finances of lower-league clubs incredibly hard</p>

<p>BBC and BT Sport pundit Robbie Savage (left) and former FA chief Greg Dyke (right) both signed the letter with clubs in the EFL standing to lose £200m without crowds this season</p>

<p>'This could lead not only to the failure of many historic community clubs, but the collapse of the national league structure that we have known for over one hundred years. </p>

<p>'These are decisions that will be made in the coming weeks, with many clubs unable to meet their payroll obligations for next month.'</p>

<p>The final amount and how the clubs will be paid is still being finalised, but it is enough money to see them through until their fans are allowed back into stadiums.</p>

<p>Dagenham managing director Steve Thompson said: 'It is fantastic the Government has realised the importance of the 67 clubs of the National League.'</p>

<p>The National League is set to start on Saturday, while National League North and South clubs are in FA Cup qualifying action.</p>
