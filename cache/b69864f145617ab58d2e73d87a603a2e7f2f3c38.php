<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Prime Minister has tonight urged the country to be tough and stick to his new coronavirus restrictions in order to flatten the Covid-19 infection rate and save Christmas.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson said new rules could be imposed on the country if people don't obey the new 'rule of six' and halt the pandemic in its tracks. </p>

<p>If infections continue to surge ministers are understood to be considering imposing a curfew, with pubs across the country having to shut early.  </p>

<p>Mr Johnson emphasised that social restrictions, localised lockdowns, and a ramped up testing programme were being implemented to battle a feared second wave, as reported by The Sun.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson said new rules could be imposed on the country if people don't obey the new 'rule of six' and halt the pandemic in its tracks.</p>

<p>Although cases have spiked over 3,000 a day, it had been mainly among younger people, who are less likely to be badly affected. </p>

<p>But now Covid-19 cases are soaring among middle-aged people in England and have risen by upwards of 90 per cent in a fortnight as the outbreak continues to grow.</p>

<p>The PM has warned the graph of infections is starting to resemble a camel's back, so ministers are implementing new measures to ensure the virus doesn't 'rip' through the country. </p>

<p>Mr Johnson told the newspaper: 'All this is to say that: Christmas we want to protect, and we want everyone to have a fantastic Christmas.</p>

<p>'But the only way to make sure the country is able to enjoy Christmas is to be tough now. So if we can grip it now, stop the surge, arrest the spike, stop the second hump of the dromedary, flatten the second hump.</p>

<p>'Dromedary or camel? I can't remember if it is a dromedary or a camel that has two humps? Umm. Please check.</p>

<p>'Anyway a double hump. So that is what we need to do!'</p>

<p>Workers prepare ahead of opening at a Coronavirus testing centre in Southwark, south London</p>

<p>Mr Johnson made a spirited defence on the new 'rule of six' which bans on groups of more than six people from meeting to help prevent the spread of the pandemic.</p>

<p>He said:  'I know that a lot of people feel that it's excessive and heavy-handed . . . but unfortunately the disease has not gone away.</p>

<p>'There are places in Europe which I will not name, such is my reputation for diplomacy, where we've come down one hump of the camel and we are approaching the next.' </p>

<p>Mr Johnson he was keen not to implement another full nationwide lockdown that 'stops business from functioning.'  </p>

<p>The PM was at pains to tell Britons that he doesn't want to impose further restrictions.</p>

<p>He added: 'We don't want to go there. We want this package to work.</p>

<p>'We are urging people to be cautious. We want people to be disciplined to get the R down.'  </p>
