<p>Australian consumer organisation CHOICE has revealed the best and worst bargain buys from Big W after testing dozens of popular gadgets - including a slow cooker, iron, blender, microwave, multicooker and hand mixer</p>

<p>BEST BUYS</p>

<p>Slow cooker </p>

<p>The expert testers recommend the $24 slow cooker that's great for turning cheap cuts of meat into tasty dishes without breaking the bank</p>

<p>If you're in the market for a new slow cooker, the expert testers recommend the $24 slow cooker that's great for turning cheap cuts of meat into tasty dishes without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Of the 32 slow cookers tested, they found Big W's cheap 5.5L model performed just as well as an expensive brand costing six times the price.</p>

<p>The budget version earned top marks for high temperature slow cooking and 80 per cent for low temperature slow cooking. </p>

<p>However, the testers pointed out the internal cooking bowl featured small handles and no grip so it was tricky for users to lift when loaded with food.</p>

<p>But if you're on a budget, the experts said it's a product worth buying.</p>

<p>Steam iron </p>

<p>For just $19, the experts said the Contempo steam iron is 'one to seriously consider'</p>

<p>For just $19, the experts said the Contempo steam iron is 'one to seriously consider' after receiving the same score as a model costing three times the price.</p>

<p>The testers found the product worked well at ironing denim, organza, linen, wool, and even silk.</p>

<p>But the product lost points on its 'propensity to drip water during use'.</p>

<p>Hand mixer</p>

<p>The $15 Contempo hand mixer scored a perfect 100 per cent in performance</p>

<p>The $15 Contempo hand mixer scored a perfect 100 per cent in performance, proving home bakers don't have to spend a fortune to whip up delectable desserts.</p>

<p>The budget buy earned a stellar 100 per cent in the beater and whisking tests - and performed just as well as expensive branded hand mixers.</p>

<p>However, the experts pointed out the appliance landed on an average 'ease of use' score due to its 'slightly uncomfortable handle without a non-slip grip'.</p>

<p>Multicooker</p>

<p>Of the 15 multicookers tested, the $79 Contempo 5-in-1 pressure cooker was one of the cheapest models on the market but it outperformed some of the pricier brands</p>

<p>Of the 15 multicookers tested, the $79 Contempo 5-in-1 pressure cooker was one of the cheapest models on the market but it outperformed some of the pricier brands.</p>

<p>The cheap appliance earned 90 per cent on pressure cooking chilli beef, 95 per cent on browning meat and 90 pre cent for cooking jasmine rice to near perfection.</p>

<p>The product featured an 'easy to clean' non-stick cooking bowl, pre-programmed settings, removable cord and accessories included. </p>

<p>The testers said they were impressed with the gadget's manual settings that allows home cooks to adjust temperature and time and its keep warm function.</p>

<p>However, they pointed out the model didn't feature a high setting for slow cooking and it landed on an average rating for 'ease of use', sautéing and searing.</p>

<p>But despite the downsides, the multicooker does the job.</p>

<p>Microwave</p>

<p>If you're on a budget, the testers recommended the $99 Contempo microwave</p>

<p>If you're on a budget, the testers recommended the $99 Contempo microwave.</p>

<p>'After putting it through our rigorous and independent testing, our team of experts found it was very good at cooking broccoli and defrosting mince and chicken,' they said. </p>

<p>But the experts pointed out the gadget landed on an average score for 'ease of use' and ability to manually reheat solid foods.</p>

<p>PRODUCT TO AVOID</p>

<p>Blender</p>

<p>The experts said the $39 model is one product to avoid buying</p>

<p>Of the 40 blenders tested, the experts the $39 model from Big W is one product to be wary of after it landed on an average overall score so it's 'not a great one'.</p>

<p>They found the product was noisy, a 'glass jug that's heavy when full' and it wasn't suitable for crushing hard ingredients such as ice.</p>

<p>The experts pointed out users must hold the lid while its blending so it doesn't make it 'hands free'. </p>

<p>However, they found the blender scored excellently when blending soft liquids and chopping but scored just two per cent in the kale test.</p>

<p>Despite its very affordable price tag, the consumer experts said there were similarly priced models worth looking at. </p>
