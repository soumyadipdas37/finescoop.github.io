<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bournemouth striker Josh King has emerged as a target for Tottenham as Jose Mourinho steps up his search for a back-up to Harry Kane, according to reports.</p>

<p>With time running out before the transfer window closes, Spurs are intensifying their efforts to bring in another forward.</p>

<p>And it is Norwegian international King who could be the man to make the move to north London, claim The Telegraph.</p>

<p>Josh King has emerged as a transfer target for Tottenham before the end of the window</p>

<p>Boss Jose Mourinho is desperately seeking added cover in his forward department</p>

<p>Mourinho has reportedly become increasingly frustrated with Spurs' failure to so far land that cover for the talismanic Kane.</p>

<p>The England captain has started in five of Tottenham's six games so far this season, including their Europa League trips to Bulgaria and North Macedonia. </p>

<p>King was part of the Bournemouth side which was relegated to the Championship last season, but he has proven himself a reliable goalscorer in the Premier League.</p>

<p>He found the back of the net 48 times in the English top-flight during the Cherries' five years in the division.</p>

<p>New boss Jason Tindall has admitted the south-coast club won't stand in the forward's way if the right offer should come in. </p>

<p>Mourinho has been left frustrated by the inability to find an alternative to striker Harry Kane</p>

<p>Although deadline day is just a week away on October 5, Premier League sides are still able to buy from the EFL for a further 11 days, increasing Spurs' chances of snaring King.</p>

<p>Finding back-up to Kane has proven problematic for Spurs in recent years, and the hope remains that they can find a successful solution.</p>

<p>Vincent Janssen proved disastrous when he arrived for £17m in 2016, scoring just two Premier League goals.</p>

<p>Fernando Llorente was a more able deputy, but still only scored twice in the Premier League before heading to Napoli in Serie A. </p>
