<p>The Queensland Government spent more than $1,000 a week on beer and wine at 99 functions from July 2019 to June 2020, new figures have revealed.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk defended spending the $59,938 on Tuesday when she was asked a parliamentary question about the bill. </p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's government spent almost $60,000 on alcohol in 12 months and a further $528,000 to gauge voter 'sentiment' on her drastic COVID-19 restrictions</p>

<p>Queenslanders are seen lining up to be tested for Covid-19 at a testing clinic at Ipswich Hospital on August 24</p>

<p>She claimed the beer and wine was offered to 'foreign dignitaries' at events that would help connect 'Queensland sellers with overseas buyers',' The Brisbane Times reported.</p>

<p>'Alcohol is only provided at functions hosted by entities within the ministerial portfolio where it is deemed appropriate to the circumstances,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>Queensland Opposition attacked the spending with Shadow Treasurer Tim Mander saying Labor 'can't be trusted with the state's finances'.</p>

<p>'It's unacceptable almost $60,000 has been blown on alcohol by agencies under Annastacia Palaszczuk's control while Queensland was in the midst of a recession,' he said. </p>

<p>A breakdown of the spending shows the Office of the Queensland Governor spent $16,042 on 60 functions in the financial year.</p>

<p>The Department of the Premier and Cabinet spent $14,909 on alcohol at its 20 functions.</p>

<p>Screen Queensland spent $6,219.</p>

<p>Queensland Trade and Investment Queensland's booze bill was $22,768.  </p>

<p>'A record 234,000 Queenslanders out of work and the worst unemployment rate in the nation is nothing to toast.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it has also been revealed Ms Palaszczuk's office has spent more than $528,000 on corona­virus polling in the past few months.</p>

<p>She also hired political strategist Mike Kaiser to help craft the state's COVID-19 economic recovery, after Queensland sensationally closed its borders to the rest of the country amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>Consultancy firm KPMG - where Mr Kaiser works - was given a confidential $275,000 contract on May 7 to provide 'advice on the development of an economic recovery roadmap', The Australian reported.</p>

<p>On May 8 Ms Palas­zczuk then released the roadmap for easing restrictions, including opening the borders on July 10.</p>

<p>Queensland's borders were closed to the entire country on March 26 before being opened to all but Victoria on July 10.</p>

<p>Ms Palas­zczuk quickly reversed the decision on August 8 and closed them again to all of New South Wales and Canberra.</p>

<p>Mr Kaiser helped the premier win the 2017 election and attended a re-election strategy summit alongside Ms Palaszczuk and senior ministers last November.</p>

<p>But a KPMG spokesperson said he will not be helping Labor with the upcoming election of October 31.</p>

<p>'KPMG has been engaged to provide assistance to the COVID-19 taskforce on the state's economic recovery strategy, including assisting the development of an infrastructure project roadmap,' he said. </p>
