<p>The sweeping order prevents their new names, addresses and jobs from ever being revealed or published unless a court agrees, court documents show.</p>

<p>Shannon was the victim in a faked kidnapping by 'Britain's worst mother' Karen Matthews in 2008, who had plotted to pocket a £50,000 reward.</p>

<p>The missing schoolgirl had been drugged, tied up and hidden in the base of a divan bed in West Yorkshire - 24 days after she disappeared.</p>

<p>Matthews and her then boyfriend Michael Donovan were found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. </p>

<p> Shannon Matthews was the victim in a faked kidnapping by Britain's 'worst mother' Karen Matthews in 2008, who had plotted to pocket a £50,000 reward</p>

<p>Shannon, who will soon turn 22, and her siblings were protected by a reporting restriction order due to expire next year.</p>

<p>Sources told The Sun that all of the siblings, including Shannon, have been left deeply affected by the traumatic events of 2008.</p>

<p>It is understood they have legally changed their names after they were taken into care, and that the lifelong order will only be changed if the family revoke it.  </p>

<p>Nine-year-old Shannon was kidnapped by Matthews and Donovan, who planned to generate money from the publicity. </p>

<p>They had planned for Donovan to release Shannon at Dewsbury Market, 'discover her', and then take her to a police station and claim a £50,000 reward. </p>

<p>Karen Matthews (pictured) had planned for Michael Donovan to release Shannon at Dewsbury Market, 'discover her', and then take her to a police station and claim a £50,000 reward</p>

<p>West Yorkshire Police found Shannon alive at 12:30 on March 14, 2008, 24 days after she went missing. She was concealed in the base of a divan bed at a flat in Lidgate Gardens, and Donovan was arrested at the scene.</p>

<p>In November 2008, Leeds Crown Court heard evidence that Shannon had been drugged to subdue her whilst she was held.</p>

<p>Donovan claimed that Matthews had asked him to look after her daughter for several days and that they would make money from newspaper rewards. </p>

<p>He told the court that she had threatened him with violence.</p>

<p>On November 27, Matthews denied having anything to do with her daughter's disappearance and had been told to 'take the blame' for what had happened.  </p>

<p>In cross-examination, Julian Goose QC said that she had told police a total of five versions of the story and accused her of 'telling lie after lie, after lie'.</p>

<p>On December 4, Matthews and Donovan were found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.</p>
