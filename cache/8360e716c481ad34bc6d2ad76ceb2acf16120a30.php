<p>Stunner: Ashley Graham proved she is as fabulous off the catwalk as on, as she strutted her stuff through the Italian streets after the show on Wednesday</p>

<p>Ashley and her husband of 10 years, Justin Ervin, welcomed their son, Isaac, in February and she is back to work as of now. </p>

<p>The stunner showed off a hint of her stomach in the crop top as she sashayed down the street while donning dark trousers. </p>

<p>Ashley recently spoke to Marie Claire on celebrating her stretchmarks after her pregnancy, defiantly declaring 'we're all superheroes' when talking about mothers. </p>

<p>'When I got pregnant, I had to re-imagine my relationship with my body with this creature inside me taking over. I was gaining weight so rapidly...</p>

<p>Wow: The sensational model, 32, looked stunning in a white crop top and tracksuit bottoms as she marked the end of her maternity leave in the fashion capital</p>

<p>'Then, to get stretch marks on my stomach, that to me was like, 'Oh my gosh. I can’t believe this happened,' Ashley told Marie Claire.</p>

<p>'At first it felt devastating, and then when I met Isaac, I said, 'No, this is exactly what every woman has talked about for ages. </p>

<p>'This is not just a battle wound. This is something that has changed my life forever, and I'm going to celebrate my new body.''  </p>
