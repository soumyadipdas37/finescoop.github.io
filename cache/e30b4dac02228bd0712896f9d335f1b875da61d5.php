<p>At least four police officers are seen talking to customers in the fast-food restaurant in Bethnal Green, east London.</p>

<p>Onlookers claim the rowdy group kicked off after a security guard told them to leave their alcohol outside.</p>

<p>Suddenly one reveller - who is taller than all the officers - charges forward, prompting one officer to deploy his taser.</p>

<p>The man crunches forward as the electric current causes his muscles to spasm but remarkably remains standing the entire time.</p>

<p>A disgruntled customer exclaims: 'I only came here for a f****** chicken sandwich.'</p>

<p>Someone can be heard shouting 'I'm not leaving' as the confrontation begins.</p>

<p>The tall man walks towards one side of the room but his path is blocked by two police officers in the footage, believed to be taken last night.</p>

<p> Another man rushes forward to intervene but is pushed back as a woman's voice is heard shouting in the background.</p>

<p>The second man continues to push forward before an officer grabs him by the arm and drags him to the floor.</p>

<p>Two women - one wearing grey and another in yellow - appear to try to help the man but are pulled away by officers.</p>

<p>One woman tells police 'he's a little skinny boy' as two officers are seen gathered around the man.</p>

<p>An officer replies: 'Step over there.'</p>

<p>A woman wearing a yellow shirt is seen sat on the floor next to the man as police yell: 'Get up and get away'.</p>

<p>An onlooker can be heard saying: 'You don't need to taser him man. What the f*** are you doing.'</p>

<p>The man remains upright as another officer speaks to him.</p>
