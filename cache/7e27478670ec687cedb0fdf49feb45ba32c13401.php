<p>The Catalan giants have contacted Inter over his availability and are now waiting to hear back from the Italian club before making a move.</p>

<p>According to Spanish news outlet Sport, Barcelona will offer Arturo Vidal as part of a swap deal in a bid to secure a move for Martinez – with Inter boss Antonio Conte keen on signing the Chilean midfielder.</p>

<p>Barcelona are set to reignite their interest in Inter Milan star Lautaro Martinez</p>

<p>Reports in Spain claim Barca are waiting to hear back from Inter over Argentine's availability</p>

<p>Vidal's deal runs until the end of June next year, but he is eager to leave the club.</p>

<p>Vidal made 43 appearances for Barcelona last season, scoring eight goals, but will likely leave the club this summer – with Inter leading the race for his signature. </p>

<p>However, any move to the Nou Camp for Martinez is now in the balance after recent reports suggested the Argentine has been put off by the switch.</p>

<p>Barcelona are in meltdown at the moment and are facing a mass exodus of first-team stars under new coach Ronald Koeman.</p>

<p>Barcelona would use Arturo Vidal in a swap deal to entice Inter into letting Martinez leave</p>

<p>Lionel Messi sent shockwaves through the footballing world last month after he told the club that he no longer wanted to stay – putting Europe's elite on red alert.</p>

<p>Koeman is also facing a mass exodus of first-team players – with Luis Suarez reportedly being shown the exit by the Dutch manager.</p>

<p>The toxic summer could get even worse for Barcelona, should Inter decide to try and tie Martinez down to a new contract.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old had a £100million release clause in his contract, which expired over the summer. </p>

<p>Inter are keen to sign Vidal this summer, with Antonio Conte rating the midfielder highly</p>

<p>His proposed new deal could eradicate any chance of a release clause in the future, meaning Barcelona would have to pay the market price for the Inter striker. </p>

<p>Martinez scored 21 goals in 49 appearances for Conte's side last season, who finished one point behind Serie A winners Juventus before finishing as runners-up in the Europa League last month. </p>

<p>He moved to Milan from Argentinian side Racing Club for a £20m fee in July 2018. </p>
