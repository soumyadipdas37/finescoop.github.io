<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>CCTV footage has revealed the final minutes a woman writhed in pain on the ground having survived a five-storey fall, only to be stabbed 40 times to death by her lesbian ex-lover.</p>

<p>The mother of murder victim Shuyu Zhou sobbed and could not watch the distressing film showing the last 11 minutes of her daughter's life during the sentencing hearing of her killer at the NSW Supreme Court on Monday.</p>

<p>'I just want an answer from the murderer, how could you be so merciless? What on earth are you, a human being or a devil?' Ms Zhou's mother Li Wang told the court. </p>

<p> Zixi Wang, 29, (pictured) went downstairs to look at her former lover, still alive after falling from her fifth-floor apartment. CCTV footage caught her going back to her apartment where she changed into dark pants, put a knife in her pocket and returned to stab Ms Zhou 40 times</p>

<p>Ms Zhou, 23, had studied philosophy at Macquarie University, played the piano and loved to sing.</p>

<p>She had recently ended a two-year relationship with Zixi Wang, 29, when she went to her ex-lover's fifth-floor apartment in Zetland, Sydney's east, to retrieve some belongings on a quiet Monday night in June 2019. </p>

<p>The court heard Wang had become depressed after the break-up and quit her job - and Ms Zhou had started a new relationship with a mutual friend. </p>

<p>Neighbours heard intense screaming coming from the unit and the sound of objects being smashed as a huge argument broke out. </p>

<p>The court heard Wang would not let Ms Zhou leave. </p>

<p>Ms Zhou then climbed over the balcony railing and fell, according to an agreed statement of facts.</p>

<p>She plunged 30 metres onto a corrugated metal fence, fracturing her lower back, lacerating her kidney and liver, dislocating her left hip and leaving her with head injuries.</p>

<p>Zixi 'Jessie' Wang, 30, (pictured) will be sentenced for murdering her ex-girlfriend Shuyu Zhou</p>

<p>As she lay writhing in pain, badly injured but alive, she tried to get away.</p>

<p>However, she couldn't get up because of her broken back and dislocated hip.</p>

<p>The 11 minutes of CCTV footage caught everything.</p>

<p>It captured the awful moment Ms Zhou's body hit the fence and bounced onto the pavement.</p>

<p>The security cameras showed her struggling in vain to get off the ground.</p>

<p>After several minutes, Wang calmly rides the elevator down to look at her former lover flailing, and straightens her victim's clothes.</p>

<p>Without calling an ambulance, the killer goes back up to her apartment, changes into dark pants, puts a knife in her pocket, and walks back down to stab her former lover 40 times. </p>

<p>While Wang changed in her apartment, a man from a neighbouring found Ms Zhou and called an ambulance.</p>

<p>While he was still on the phone to emergency services, Wang returned with her knife. Frightened, the man retreated.</p>

<p>The CCTV cameras filmed as Wang stabbed her screaming victim over and over again for more than two minutes, cutting her neck, her arms and her torso. </p>

<p>Wang then fled in Ms Zhou’s white Mercedes Benz before being arrested the next morning trying to climb over a fence at the Sea Cliff Bridge north of Wollongong.</p>

<p>The final minutes of Shuyu Zhou's life were played as the court heard of the life-long impact the brutal slaying had on her grieving family which had moved from China to Sydney in 2009.</p>

<p>Ms Zhou's mother Li Wang said her daughter had only moved out of home one month before she was murdered. </p>

<p>'(Zhou was) kind, healthy, beautiful and very happy to help people,' Li Wang said.</p>

<p>Li Wang wept as she said her own life was 'as good as dead', however she wanted to live to see killer Zixi Wang, now aged 30, get the justice she deserves. </p>

<p>Wang refused to give evidence at the sentencing hearing and did not apologise to the victim's family, News.com.au reported.</p>

<p>Justice Robert Beech-Jones will hand down the sentence on October 2. </p>
