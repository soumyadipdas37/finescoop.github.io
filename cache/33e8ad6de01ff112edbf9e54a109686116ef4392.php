<p>'Each of the jewel tone colors ruby, emerald &amp; sapphire are unique to each sister and have a symbolic meaning that we really gravitated to and found inspiring.'</p>

<p>'I've always loved the deep green color of an emerald stone and how it symbolizes love, prosperity and healing.'</p>

<p>'My scent itself is musky and rich but still has those sweet white floral notes that I naturally always go to. I can’t wait for you guys to smell how amazing these new scents are!'</p>
