<p>He alleges that staff at the hospital 'failed to adequately or properly assess the penis adequately or at all' and did not administer antibiotics for the first one-and-a-half days of treatment. </p>

<p>Among the other claims is that he was not transferred to Royal Melbourne Hospital for specialist treatment when the infection was diagnosed. </p>
