<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A community outreach worker at a Melbourne safe-injecting clinic has been jailed for drug trafficking.</p>

<p>Matthew Honey's job was to encourage drug users to give up their habit, but he was spreading the drug himself.</p>

<p>He was ordered on Monday to spend 12 months behind bars after admitting he was trafficking heroin in Richmond in September and October last year.</p>

<p>Drug support worker Matthew Honey, 50, (pictured) was convicted of dealing heroin to vulnerable addicts outside Melbourne's controversial safe injecting room</p>

<p>But Honey appealed the sentence immediately and was freed on bail.</p>

<p>The 50-year-old has been a heroin user since his 20s.</p>

<p>Honey was employed by the clinic as a 'peer worker' to educate drug users about how to use safely, to avoid overdose and encourage addicts to use the safe injecting clinic rather than public places or privately.</p>

<p>He was trained and regularly called to revive people who had overdosed in the street.</p>

<p>'You were distressed as you had attended an inordinate number of overdoses, several involving deaths of people known to you,' magistrate Kieran Gilligan said. </p>

<p>But he also used his position to traffic drugs to people he knew around the centre, outside a primary school and near his home, which was only a short distance away.</p>

<p>Honey had been a long-time heroin user himself who had gone clean, but then relapsed six months prior to his offending.</p>

<p>He used his work phone to organise a network of heroin users to sell to. </p>

<p>Using the code name 'Mum', a woman would supply Honey and a co-offender heroin to be sold each day. </p>

<p>Phone records, along with CCTV and evidence from an undercover police officer, exposed his offending.</p>

<p>'In my view, your offending involved a gross breach of trust because of your employment at the centre and that aggravates your offending,' Magistrate Gilligan said, as quoted in the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Pictured: Syringes left discarded in North Richmond. The suburb has its own bespoke safe injecting room where drug users can shoot up under supervision</p>

<p>'Your conduct completely undermined and subverted the purposes of the establishment of the facility.' </p>

<p>The court heard he suffered PTSD and had also been subjected to abuse by 'some sort of local residents' vigilante group'.</p>

<p>Mr Gilligan also noted Honey has previous convictions for violence and dishonesty.</p>

<p>He has been jailed in the past.</p>

<p>His lawyer had asked for a community order, but the magistrate said he had five previous chances at orders and breached four of them.</p>

<p>As part of his bail, Honey must stay off drugs, report daily to police, and cannot go within 50m of the safe injecting room. </p>
