<p>Earlier in the pandemic, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.</p>

<p>The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between being with his kids.</p>

<p>However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family of six kids all together.</p>

<p>'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.</p>

<p>It's been a long time : The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between being with his kids</p>

<p>Daddy-daughter: Ant and Ammo enjoyed tea time and steak frites together in the UK</p>

<p>'Being there.... congratulations Ammo on your graduation!! You make this Daddo so so proud of you as you move into life's next adventure!' </p>

<p>It seems he is making up for lost time now though. In the new photos, the trio snuggled in bed together, enjoyed outdoor time by a picturesque pond and dined on steak frites.</p>

<p>Plus his timing ended up being perfect because he was able to celebrate two big milestones for his kids. </p>

<p>'Archo you have grown into such an amazing young man and I love you to my core,' Ant penned to his son for his birthday.</p>

<p>Adding: 'Being there.... congratulations Ammo on your graduation!! You make this Daddo so so proud of you as you move into life's next adventure!' </p>
