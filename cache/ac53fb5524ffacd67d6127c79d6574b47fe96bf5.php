<p>But there is BEN: The actress is often photographed walking her dog or being next to her Dark Water costar Ben Affleck whom she has been dating this year</p>

<p>The fame game: With her beau Ben in July in LA. Ana said she did not think of fame before she started acting</p>

<p>'She is my biggest cheerleader,' said Ana. </p>

<p>'I showed her my screen test for Marilyn and of course I had on like a random wig they found which didn't fit me, so-so makeup and so-so wardrobe but even then, seeing me in the part like that, she got very excited.'</p>

<p>Playing Monroe was 'very intense,' added the beauty.</p>

<p>Rational: 'It is just a consequence of my job,' said the star matter of factly</p>

<p>She also talked her breakout role in Knives Out, an ensemble murder mystery with Don Johnson.</p>

<p>When she got the offer all it said was she was going to play a 'Latina, caretaker, pretty.'</p>

<p>'I really pay attention to what that little description is,' she said. 'I'm sure whoever did it wasn't thinking about what that mean but for me, I was just like, "Oh no, I'm not doing this!" What do you mean, "Latina, caretaker, pretty?"'</p>

<p>Life as Ana: The fame she has experienced so far has helped her relate to Marilyn Monroe</p>

<p>Fame is hard: 'It was her worst nightmare,' said de Armas, who has had to research Monroe</p>

<p>Next: Ana also shared that her Knives Out co-star Jamie Lee Curtis helped her land the role of Marilyn Monroe in the upcoming film Blonde</p>

<p>And she added she is very proud of being Latina.</p>

<p>'Even if you are playing a Latina, not all Latinas are the same... I want to think and believe that I can play anybody, anywhere in the world because the stories I want to tell are universal.'</p>

<p>When she read the script she was thrilled and felt comfortable with her character that she describes as a 'diamond' but she was 'terrified' as her insecurities about her talent and her ability to speak English well crept in.</p>

<p>De Armas also said, 'I think there needs to be a push for better roles for Latinas overall.'  </p>

<p>As far as her next project, there is nothing due to COVID and she hopes 2021 will be better. The star also mentioned a Knives Out sequel which she hopes will happen.</p>
