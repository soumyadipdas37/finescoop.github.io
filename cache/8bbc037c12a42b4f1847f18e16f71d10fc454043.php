<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has revealed awkward details about her relationship with Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, admitting it 'isn't positive'. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian has revealed that she has received absolutely no communication or warning on Queensland's hard border closure with NSW, which has caused chaos for local communities.</p>

<p>The Liberal state leader admitted to Ben Fordham Live on 2GB on Wednesday that her relationship with Ms Palaszczuk was not positive and it 'wasn't through lack of trying'. </p>

<p>'I've tried to establish a positive relationship, but it's a bit difficult when decisions are made without even telling us,' Ms Berejiklian said.</p>

<p>Former Queensland premier Campbell Newman tweeted: 'So if you are AFL royalty you can get into Queensland, with your family, but if you live in northern NSW with your seriously ill child you can't'</p>

<p>'Can I compare that to Dan Andrews and the prime minister? The three of us worked together on a very difficult decision about the Victorian and NSW border, and I would like to see that applied to all borders.</p>

<p>'I think that at this stage of the pandemic all of us should be thinking about how we can make life easier for our citizens, what we can do rather than what we can't do and that is certainly the head space we are in NSW.'</p>

<p>The revelation comes as Ms Palaszczuk brushes off hoards of criticism from interstate politicians about her willingness to host the AFL grand final - despite banning families from being reunited in her state.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk says being awarded hosting rights for the AFL grand final is a win for her state's response to the pandemic.</p>

<p>The Gabba in Brisbane has edged Perth's Optus Stadium and the Adelaide Oval to be named as the venue for the AFL's showpiece event on October 24. </p>

<p>The premier boasted the hosting rights are a further endorsement of her strong response to COVID-19, including keeping the borders shut, amid sustained criticism from her political rivals.</p>

<p>'This is a historic day - it's a historic day for the AFL, it's a historic day for Queensland,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>But she has been slammed by former Queensland premier Campbell Newman, who tweeted: 'So if you are AFL royalty you can get into Queensland, with your family, but if you live in northern NSW with your seriously ill child you can't!</p>

<p>'Nothing demonstrates more starkly the politically cynical and elitist reality of Annastacia (Palaszczuk) and Dr Young's restrictions.'  </p>

<p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro said it was hypocritical for Queensland to close borders over concerns about COVID-19 in NSW, but let in hundreds of AFL officials from the declared virus hotspot of Victoria.</p>

<p>He claims the border closure is hurting NSW residents who need healthcare in Queensland.</p>

<p>'This is not about just Queensland versus NSW. It is not State of Origin, it is about people,' he said. </p>

<p>Queensland's border slammed shut to Victorians on July 10 as a second wave of coronavirus began smashing the state.</p>

<p>Fears the outbreak could spill into NSW quickly mounted, prompting Ms Palaszcuk to lock NSW and the ACT out a month later, on August 8.</p>

<p>The Queensland government will review the border closure at the end of this month but on Tuesday Ms Palaszczuk announced it would not open to NSW in September.</p>

<p>The premier said Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young wanted to see southern states, and NSW in particular, go through two COVID-19 incubation cycles without any cases of community transmission. </p>

<p>This is despite widespread fears the border shutdowns will cripple the economy, with Queensland's closure alone costing $17million a day.</p>

<p>Just two new COVID-19 cases were recorded in Queensland in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, with the number of active cases in an existing cluster remaining at 28.</p>

<p>The current outbreak in the state's southeast is centred on the Corrective Services Academy at Wacol, southwest of Brisbane.</p>

<p>One was a student at the Staines Memorial College at Redbank Plains, which has been closed since Sunday so all 600 students can be tested.</p>

<p>The other case was a nurse who was a close contact of a known case.</p>

<p>More than 18,000 tests have been conducted in 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, more than double the 7480 in the previous 24 hours.   </p>

<p>Victoria:</p>

<p>Victoria is under strict Stage Four and Stage Three lockdown, meaning residents cannot partake in non-essential travel.</p>

<p>New South Wales:</p>

<p>New South Wales currently only has incoming restrictions in place for Victorians, meaning residents from every other state and territory are welcome to travel there.</p>

<p>Travellers from New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory can enter only after testing and quarantining.</p>

<p>Northern Territory:</p>

<p>The Northern Territory border remains open but anybody who has been in a hot spot like Victoria or parts of New South Wales must undertake 14 days hotel quarantine at a cost of $2,500. </p>

<p>Australian Capital Territory:</p>

<p>Anybody who has travelled to Victoria is barred from entering the region, unless they are an ACT resident.</p>
