<p>The Italian, a former team principal of Ferrari, has been named the new president and chief executive officer.</p>

<p>Chase Carey, the chairman and CEO of F1 since January 2017, will step back to a non-executive chairman role and relinquish day-to-day control.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton has described the return of Stefano Domenicali to Formula One as 'amazing'</p>

<p>Italian Domenicali, 55, was formerly team principal of Ferrari and becomes new F1 president</p>

<p>And six-time world champion Hamilton was among many to welcome Domenicali's appointment.</p>

<p>'Amazing. I know Stefano really well. He's one of the nicest guys that I know,' Hamilton said ahead of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.</p>

<p>'I don't think they could have chosen someone better, to be honest, to replace some big shoes of Chase, who has done an amazing job and has always had such a great approach.</p>

<p>'Stefano has got a great heart. He's got a good family and good morals. The future's positive.'</p>

<p>Domenicali, 55, worked as Ferrari team principal between 2008 and 2014, and has since worked with the Volkswagen Group and as the chief executive of Lamborghini.</p>

<p>Domenicali has been chief executive of Lamborghini in recent years after leaving Formula 1</p>

<p>He has also been head of the single-seater commission of F1's governing body the FIA and will continue in that role.</p>

<p>The Italian said: 'I am thrilled to join the Formula 1 organisation, a sport that has always been part of my life.</p>

<p>'I was born in Imola and live in Monza. I've remained connected to the sport through my work with the single-seater commission at the FIA and I look forward to connecting with the teams, promoters, sponsors and many partners in F1 as we continue to drive the business ahead.</p>

<p>'The past six years at Audi and then leading Lamborghini [both part of the Volkswagen Group] have given me broader perspective and experience that I will bring to Formula 1.'</p>
