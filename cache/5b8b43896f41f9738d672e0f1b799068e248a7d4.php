<p>Nine-year-old Lancinet Keita was sent home from school in Massachusetts and told to get tested for COVID-19 after sneezing a couple of times in class on Tuesday </p>

<p>'I was thinking I didn’t have anything, just a couple sneezes,' Lancinet said.</p>

<p>Thierno Keita said his son was in good health when he left for school that morning,  and also he had no symptoms when he picked him up from the nurse's office. </p>

<p>'And I checked his temperature: everything was perfect,' Keita said after repeatedly checking that Lancinet had no fever.  </p>

<p>The father now plans to get Lancinet tested for the coronavirus so he could return to school as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Keita said he is upset about what happened and believes that his son's teacher has overrated, causing him to miss work and and his son to miss school.  </p>

<p>Officials at Bishop Elementary School have confirmed the incident, saying that a student was sent home early on Tuesday after 'he displayed COVID-19 related symptoms.' </p>

<p>The statement continued: 'this decision was made both out of an abundance of caution and in accordance with district protocols related to COVID-19. This isolated incident is not indicative of any need for wider concern of COVID-19 exposure.</p>

<p>'Per district protocols, the student will either have to produce a negative COVID-19 test, written documentation from a health care provider stating it is an alternative illness or be symptom free for 10 days following the start of the symptoms.'</p>

<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, Massachusetts has reported more than 128,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 9,328 deaths.  </p>
