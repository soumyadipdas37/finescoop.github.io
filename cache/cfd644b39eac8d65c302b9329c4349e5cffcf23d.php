<p>Brentford beat Wycombe Wanderers on penalties in round one of the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>It was the first match at the west Londoners' new 17,250-capacity ground near Kew Bridge</p>

<p>Brentford nearly capitalised on the man advantage as new striker Ivan Toney fired straight at Ryan Allsop while Sergi Canos hit the post with a wonderful curling effort.</p>

<p>But the Chairboys hit back as Pinnock gave the ball away deep inside the Brentford half to Scott Kashket, who squared to Daryl Horgan to fire past Luke Daniels on his Wycombe debut. </p>
