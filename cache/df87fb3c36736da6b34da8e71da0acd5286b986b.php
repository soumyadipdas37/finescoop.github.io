<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>LaLiga have dealt a blow to Lionel Messi's desire to leave Barcelona after the Spanish top-flight confirmed he is not able to leave on a free transfer. </p>

<p>The Barcelona captain shocked the world of football on Tuesday by informing the Catalans of his desire to leave the Spanish giants this summer on a free transfer.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old has a clause in his contract which states he can leave on a free transfer at the end of each season should he want to, one which Barcelona claim expired on June 10. </p>

<p>LaLiga have ruled that Lionel Messi (above) cannot leave Barcelona on a free transfer this year</p>

<p>A LaLiga statement stated that clubs will need to pay the £630million release clause</p>

<p>And LaLiga have sided with Barcelona's version of events, which boosts the Catalans chances of keeping hold of their talisman this summer. </p>

<p>A La Liga statement read on Sunday: 'The contract is currently in force and has a "termination clause" applicable to the event that Lionel Andrés Messi decides to urge the early unilateral termination of the contract, carried out in accordance with article 16 of Royal Decree 1006/1985, of June 26, by which regulates the special employment relationship of professional athletes.</p>

<p>'In compliance with the applicable regulations, and following the corresponding procedure in these cases, LaLiga will not carry out the prior visa process for the player to be removed from the federation if they have not previously paid the amount (£630million) of said clause.'</p>

<p>Messi has been agitating to leave Barcelona since handing in a transfer request on Tuesday</p>

<p>It means Manchester City will need to pay the £630million release clause to sign the Argentinian star this summer, or strike a transfer agreement with Barcelona in the market.</p>

<p>This could impact the deal as Messi's overall transfer package will now be larger, given his large wages and image rights payments. </p>

<p>Messi is understood to earn £63million-a-year which includes basic salary and image rights fees. However, performance-related bonuses and other sponsorship agreements could take that number to around £94million-a-year.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old could end up joining Manchester City, managed by Pep Guardiola (right)</p>

<p>In the event of an exceptional season where the 33-year-old wins the Ballon D'Or, several major team honours or scores a record amount of goals, he could earn more than £110million in a season. </p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, Messi refused to turn up to Barcelona's pre-season coronavirus tests at the training ground, meaning he cannot take part in the first training sessions of the 2020-21 season which begin on Monday.</p>

<p>Signing for Manchester City would reunite Messi with Pep Guardiola, who he spent four years under at Barcelona.</p>

<p>Messi's overall record at Barcelona has seen him score over 600 career goals and win over 33 major trophies with the Catalans. The Argentinian star has also won six Ballon D'Or trophies in his career.  </p>
