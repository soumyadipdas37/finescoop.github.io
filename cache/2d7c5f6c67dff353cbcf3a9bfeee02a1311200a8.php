<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mauricio Pochettino has once again claimed it is his 'dream' to manage Real Madrid and reveals he would not have taken the Barcelona job had they offered it to him this summer. </p>

<p>The former Tottenham boss is still out of work after being sacked by the Premier League club last year but is still regarded as one of the best coaches in the world and is on the radar of Europe's elite clubs.</p>

<p>He was linked with both the Barcelona and Juventus jobs over the course of the summer but there was no formal interest from either.</p>

<p>Mauricio Pochettino says he would not have taken the Barcelona job had they offered it to him this summer</p>

<p>Pochettino says he didn't see himself working alongside club president Josep Maria Bartomeu</p>

<p>However, the Argentine has revealed he would not have taken over at the Nou Camp anyway because he feels he could not have worked successfully with president Josep Maria Bartomeu. </p>

<p>'They didn't offer me to coach Barca,' he told Marca.</p>

<p> 'I didn't see myself with [president Josep Maria] Bartomeu.</p>

<p>'I did eat with Ramon Planes [Barcelona sporting director] because we have a friendship for many years, since 2009 when he signed for Espanyol.</p>

<p>'I don't know if I'll ever coach Madrid, but of course it's my dream.</p>

<p>'If it's not the best it's one of the best clubs in the world. I'm no different, everyone has it on their dream list.'</p>

<p>The former Tottenham boss reaffirmed it is his 'dream' to take over at Real Madrid in the future</p>

<p>Pochettino once said he would never manage Barcelona because of his links to local rivals Espanyol. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen if his stance has now changed, given he is looking for work and the under-fire Bartomeu is nearing the end of his presidency.</p>

<p>The 48-year-old has seemingly tried to clear the air over those comments, claiming he was being 'ironic'.</p>

<p>'I was ironic then,' Pochettino added. 'It was my first news conference at Tottenham and they asked me about the Barca rumours. Then I answered with my irony and I think I went too far, I said what I said.</p>

<p>He also tried to play down his claims he would never manage Barcelona because of his links to local rivals Espanyol</p>

<p>'It sounds very nice for the radical Espanyol fan but I did not want to speak for that radical fan. Nor do I have to justify any statement because no one can question my love for Espanyol.'</p>

<p>Pochettino has been courted by most of Europe's leading clubs since his impressive work in north London came to an end.</p>

<p>While he has fielded some calls over possible jobs this summer, there has also been no word on others.</p>

<p>'Neither PSG, nor Juventus, nor Inter Milan [made offers],' he revealed.</p>

<p>'I did have a call from Monaco and Benfica. I have no need to lie.'</p>
