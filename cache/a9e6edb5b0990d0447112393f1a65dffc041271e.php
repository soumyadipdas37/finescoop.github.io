<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Victorian driver has been cruelly fined $1,677 for eating a McDonald's takeaway meal in his own car by a river after a long day at work.</p>

<p>Tom Tran bought the meal at McDonald's in Shepparton, 200km north east of Melbourne, before stopping on Tom Collins Drive to eat by the Goulburn River. </p>

<p>'I got fined for eating my McDonald's by the river a few weeks ago. Apparently that's illegal,' Mr Tran wrote on Facebook on Saturday. </p>

<p>'Daniel Andrews should be the one to pay my $1,652 fine.' </p>

<p>Greater Shepparton has had zero active cases of COVID-19 since September 17.  </p>

<p>Tom Tran (pictured) bought the meal at McDonald's in Shepparton, three hours north east of Melbourne, before stopping on Tom Collins Drive to eat by the Goulburn River</p>

<p>Mr Tran said he was fined for eating McDonald's in his car by Goulburn River. He later posted about it on Facebook, saying 'Daniel Andrews should be the one to pay my $1,652 fine' </p>

<p>Mr Tran was fined before regional Victoria moved to its third step of easing restrictions on September 16. </p>

<p>He shared a picture of his infringement notice to Facebook, which said he has to pay a total of $1,677.80 by October 9 - which is mysteriously $25.80 more than the $1,652 fine. </p>

<p>'Refuse or fail to comply with a direction, or a requirement made of, a person in the exercise of a power under an authorisation given under section 199 (individual),' the notice read, referencing the Public Health and Wellbeing Act 2008. </p>

<p>But Mr Tran argued that he was perfectly justified in leaving the house. </p>

<p>'I had a legitimate reason. I was going out to get food,' he wrote on Facebook. </p>

<p>The Shepparton man, who is originally from Darwin, later posted in the 'Darwin - Have A Whinge' Facebook group. </p>

<p>'My whinge: I am stuck here in Victoria and I f*<strong>ing miss Darwin. Thank f</strong>k I don't live in Melbourne, but I miss barramundi,' he wrote.  </p>

<p>Regional Victoria, including Shepparton, has no restrictions on the reasons to leave home as of September 16.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Melburnians are only allowed to leave the home for shopping, socialising or exercise, permitted work or education and caregiving or medical treatment.   </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four deaths on Wednesday, bringing down the 14-day average to 16.4 in Melbourne and 0.3 in regional Victoria.</p>
