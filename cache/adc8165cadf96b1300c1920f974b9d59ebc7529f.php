<p>Out and about: Emily Ratajkowski kept things comfortable as she stepped out in New York on Tuesday morning</p>

<p>Peeks of Emily's long, chocolate brown colored hair peered out from underneath the hood of her sweatshirt.</p>

<p>She stepped out wearing white Nike tennis shoes and carried a reusable water flask into a restaurant. </p>

<p>Ratajkowski hid her eyes underneath a pair of dark sunglasses and wore a black face mask to match her husband's covering. </p>

<p>Just the two of us: The 29-year-old model hid her famous figure underneath an over-sized sweatsuit while grabbing breakfast with her husband Sebastian Bear-McClard</p>

<p>Deep in thought: Emily dreamed of warmer days as she shared a swimsuit snap from her Inamorata line on Instagram</p>

<p>Sebastian was equally casually clad in a dark red sweater paired with grey running pants and matching trainers.</p>

<p>Emily recently released a bombshell essay through New York Magazine where she detailed being sexually assaulted by photographer Jonathan Leder in 2012.</p>

<p>In Buying Myself Back, Ratajkowski discussed a particular incident during a photoshoot in the Catskillls where Leder plied her with alcohol to the point of her passing out, only for Emily to wake up and find 'his fingers suddenly inside of [her]'. </p>

<p>Years after the assault, Leder chose to publish her Polaroids in an $80 book, some of which were 'the most revealing and vulgar' photos from their 2012 shoot. </p>

<p>Casual: Ratajkowski paired a navy blue hoodie with large track pants and made sure to wear a face covering as an added safety measure due to the ongoing global pandemic</p>

<p>His and hers: Sebastian was equally casually clad in a dark red sweater paired with grey running pants and matching trainers</p>

<p>After publication, Emily embarked on a legal battle claiming she never consented to publishing the images.</p>

<p>Leder vehemently denied the claims of sexual assault.</p>

<p>Heather Tynan, the editorial director of his company, Imperial Publishing, released a statement attacking the model and accusing her of trying to drum up press for herself with the story.</p>

<p>'We are all deeply disturbed to read Ms. Ratajkowski’s latest (false) statements to NY mag in her never-ending search for press and publicity,' she said in the statement released on Imperial Publishing's website.</p>

<p>'Of course Mr. Leder totally denies her outrageous allegations of being "assaulted." It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive to lie in such a way to the press routinely.'   </p>

<p>Difficult: Emily recently released a bombshell essay through New York Magazine where she detailed being sexually assaulted by photographer Jonathan Leder in 2012</p>
