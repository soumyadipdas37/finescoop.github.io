<p>The sac-winged bat has a wide-ranging vocal repertoire, using different 'songs' to court mates and defend its territory.</p>

<p>Scientists have recently discovered that females also use a special high-pitched voice to encourage their pups to start 'talking.'</p>

<p>The study also found that males communicate with offspring, but in a way of teaching the pups how to speak the 'accent' of the social group to help with development.</p>

<p>Mother bats use 'baby talk' with their offspring, much the same way humans do, scientists have discovered. Female greater sac-winged bats responded to pups when they 'babbled' by using a higher pitch than the one they used with adult bats</p>

<p>A team of researchers examined the vocalizations of the greater sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata), a species common in Brazil, Colombia and other parts of Central and South America. </p>

<p>The team included researchers from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, the Museum of Natural History Berlin and the Free University of Berlin.</p>

<p>Analyzing recordings of parent-offspring interactions, they found that mother bats responded to pups when they 'babbled,' or began experimenting with vocalizations, usually in the first few months of life.</p>

<p>And like their human counterparts, these mammalian moms used a different pitch, or 'color,' with their offspring than they did with other adults.</p>

<p>Male bats also communicated with the pups, said Smithsonian research associate Mirjam Knörnschild, who co-authored the paper. </p>

<p>Male bats also communicated with pups but they seemed intent on transmitting the vocal signature of their social group</p>

<p>A sonogram of a babbling bout by a young greater sac-winged bat. Pups have been reported jumbling up various calls and sounds as they're learning to vocalize. They may mimic a territorial challenge, followed by a few echolocation clicks and a courting trill  </p>

<p>But they seemed intent on transmitting the vocal signature of their social group. </p>

<p>In other words, they wanted to teach their children the local 'accent.'</p>

<p>'Pup isolation calls are acoustically more similar to those of males from the same social group than to those of other males,' Knörnschild said. </p>

<p>'These results suggest that adult male vocalizations may serve as guidance for the development of group signatures in pup calls.'</p>

<p>Researcher Mirjam Knoerschild studying bat behavior in Panama. Her team's research suggests familial relationships among bats are more complex than previously thought, and could lead to a deeper understanding of parent-child dynamics in humans</p>

<p>Sac-wing pups have been reported jumbling up various calls and sounds as they're learning to vocalize. </p>

<p>They may mimic a territorial challenge, for example, then issue a few echolocation clicks followed by a courting trill.</p>

<p>It's the only known example of baby babble in non-primate mammals.</p>

<p>The study suggests familial relationships among bats are more complex than previously thought, and could lead to a deeper understanding of parent-child dynamics in humans. </p>

<p>The greater sac-winged bat isn't the only species that exhibits humanlike behavior. Vampire bats form long-lasting 'friendships' and can rescue hungry roostmates from the brink of starvation by regurgitating their blood meals into their mouths</p>

<p>'These results show that social feedback is important during vocal development, not only in humans but also in other vocal-learning species,' said Ahana Fernandez, a researcher at the Natural History Museum.</p>

<p>'I believe that bats are a very promising taxon to investigate key shared features of language, such as the vocal learning ability, and that this study will inspire further studies in the biolinguistics field.'</p>

<p>The greater sac-winged bat isn't the only species known to exhibit humanlike behavior. Vampire bats form long-lasting 'friendships' and will rescue hungry roostmates from starvation.</p>

<p>If a bat is hungry, his roostmate may regurgitate blood into its mouths, a sign of a true bond that can build trust among unrelated vampire bats, researchers say.</p>

<p>'If they starve three nights in a row there is a high chance they'll die,' said ecologist Gerald Carter of Ohio State University. 'Because of this, vampire bats with close social ties can rescue their weakened partners from the brink.'</p>

<p>The tiny bloodsuckers also practice social distancing: If a roostmate is sick, they'll stop grooming them and keep their distance.</p>

<p>They'll continue sharing blood, though. Preserving the larger social system by keeping their friends alive is more important than the risk of contagion, scientists say.  </p>
