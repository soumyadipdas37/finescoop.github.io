<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A contract formalising the heavyweight mega-showdown between Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury is on the verge of being sent out, AJ's promotor Eddie Hearn has revealed.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the pair agreed terms in principle that would see them meet in an all-British clash where the heavyweight division would be unified with both men putting their belts on the line. </p>

<p>Both Joshua and Fury have opponents to defeat before the pair can finally face, with AJ set to face mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev while the Gypsy King will fight Deontay Wilder for a third time.  </p>

<p>Eddie Hearn says he is close to sending out a formal contract for Anthony Joshua - Tyson Fury</p>

<p>The all-British showdown would see the pair unify the heavyweight division in a huge clash</p>

<p>Hearn, who represents WBA, WBO, IBF and IBO champion Joshua, has been in contact with Bob Arum, Fury's US promotor, in a bid to finalise details over the unification bout. </p>

<p>The Matchroom chief has revealed that some last details need to be sorted before Joshua and Fury will meet in a highly-anticipated heavyweight match up. </p>

<p>'Yeah, I've been talking to Bob Arum about various things,' Hearn told Sky Sports. 'Fury against Joshua is a big ambition of everybody involved, to be honest.</p>

<p>'We want to talk about it, but we also want to take care of business, which is Kubrat Pulev for AJ, and Deontay Wilder for Tyson Fury.' </p>

<p>AJ has to face Kubrat Pulev first, while Fury must fight Deontay Wilder for a third time</p>

<p>Hearn says talks are ongoing with Fury's US promotor, Bob Arum, over finalising a deal</p>

<p>Hearn revealed that fans can expect to see the two Brits face off at some point in 2021, with the Matchroom chief 'on the verge' of sending an offer to Arum.  </p>

<p>'I'm very sure you're going to see two versions of that fight in 2021. I think we're on the verge now of papering that deal with Bob Arum. We haven't done it yet, but all the conversations are positive.</p>

<p>'We have a lot on our plates with the pandemic, making sure we keep boxing alive and trying to deliver those fights for AJ and Fury, but I think 2021, I'm very sure you'll see those two fights.</p>

<p>'Both guys have great personalities, they can fight, and it is overdue. Let's get it done.'</p>
