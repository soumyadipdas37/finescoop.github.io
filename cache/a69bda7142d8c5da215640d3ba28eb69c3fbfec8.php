<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Christmas will not be the same in some areas of the country this year as many festive light switching-on events have been cancelled over coronavirus concerns.</p>

<p>Even the festive season will be affected by Covid-19 this year as many councils have already scrapped plans for the annual light shows.</p>

<p>The Metro reports that councils in Scotland have already cancelled their plans for this year's switch-ons.</p>

<p>Christmas light switch-on ceremonies have been cancelled in some areas of the country over concerns that large gatherings, even outside, could help increase the spread of coronavirus. Pictured: Regent Street's Christmas light display on November 15, 2018</p>

<p>Areas that have already cancelled their events include East Lothian, North and South Lanarkshire, Perth and Kinross, South Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and Highland council areas.</p>

<p>It's not just light events which have become casualties of the virus, with Edinburgh scaling back it's city Christmas market.</p>

<p>In July, they also suspended the sale of tickets for their Hogmanay party but have since confirmed that the event will take place but also scaled back.</p>

<p>Speaking about the cancellations East Lothian Council leader Willie Innes said that large gatherings pose a greater risk of spreading the virus.</p>

<p>He said: 'Gathering many local people together for community events, even outdoors, poses a risk to public health.’ </p>

<p>Elsewhere, Perth &amp; Kinross Council said that although they will still be switching o  their Christmas light, there will not be a ceremony for people to attend.</p>

<p>So far there have been no announcements regarding Christmas lights in London, but earlier this month it was confirmed that Winter Wonderland would not be going ahead.</p>

<p>In a statement Winter Wonderland said: 'Hyde Park Winter Wonderland has always been about bringing friends and family together in a fun, safe and interactive environment to celebrate the festive season.</p>

<p>Winter Wonderland is another Christmas event that will not be taking place this year over coronavirus concerns. Pictured: Funfair rides are lit up at Winter Wonderland in Hyde Park Winter Wonderland, London, 2017</p>

<p>'Our team has worked tirelessly, exploring every possible option in the hopes of being able to move forward with the event in a responsible manner and provide London with some much-needed festive cheer.</p>

<p>'However, in light of ongoing health concerns, travel restrictions and uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, and considering the size and scale of this event, we just couldn't find a way to do that without compromising the magical attractions, shows, rides, bars and experiences that make Hyde Park Winter Wonderland so special.'</p>
