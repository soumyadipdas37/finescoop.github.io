<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Emily Maitlis is the award winning journalist lauded for her bombshell interview with Prince Andrew last year - but even she can make a slip-up.</p>

<p>The BBC Newsnight presenter was left red-faced last night after making an awkward blunder live on air last night. </p>

<p>The journalist, 50, was introducing former health secretary Alan Johnson when she accidentally described him as being 'from Hell', instead of 'Hull'.</p>

<p>In the live broadcast of the popular show, which attracts around 300,000 viewers each night, she said: 'The former health secretary Alan Johnson joins us down the line from Hell.'</p>

<p>But presenter quickly realised her mistake, correcting herself by saying: 'From Hull,' </p>

<p>She quickly made light of the gaffe, which prompted a laugh from Mr Johnson, adding: 'I'm never going to recover from that now.'</p>

<p>Award winning journalist and BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis was left red-faced last night after making an awkward blunder live on air last night</p>

<p>The BBC journalist was introducing former health secretary Alan Johnson when she accidentally described him as being 'from Hell', instead of 'Hull'</p>

<p>Ms Maitlis later took to Twitter to talk about the slip-up, where she added: 'For clarity I do know Hull is not Hell. It's rather lovely.'</p>

<p>The journalist was replying to a tweet by fellow journalist Charlie Proctor, who, quoting the blunder, said: 'Forget the Prince Andrew interview, this is what you will be remembered for!' </p>

<p>Others also commented on the slip-up, saying: 'An evening chuckle does us all some good!! I assume your brain was reading ahead to 'former health Secretary'!'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Emily. Most of us would have given a defensive or apologetic response. Yours was self deprecating and numerous. Brilliant. This is why you do your job. Do not be compromised. You have so many supporters.'</p>

<p>The slip-up is not the first involving a BBC presenter and a politician while live on air.</p>

<p>In 2010, then-BBC Radio Four Today anchorman Jim Naughtie, mixed-up his words when he was introducing then Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt.</p>

<p>However, instead of calling him Jeremy Hunt, then 'C' in 'culture' slipped into the place of the 'H', creating an expletive.  </p>

<p>Mr Naughtie instantly corrected himself, but a second or two later, what he had said hit him and he involuntarily snorted with laughter, and then tried to disguise the noise as a cough.</p>

<p>Mr Hunt saw the funny side, tweeting: 'They say prepare for anything before going on Today but that took the biscuit ... I was laughing as much as u Jim or shld I say Dr Spooner.' </p>
