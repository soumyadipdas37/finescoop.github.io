<p>A home baker has shared a hilarious cake fail on social media after attempting to recreate a $25 pre-made unicorn cake from Coles.</p>

<p>Laura Jayne, from Perth in Western Australia, had wanted a delicious fondant-encrusted cake like the popular version from the supermarket - but she decided to make it herself. </p>

<p>'We were pretty sure we could buy a packet mix from Coles and replicate the unicorn cake. I personally think the resemblance is uncanny,' she wrote in a Facebook group, along with a photo showing her efforts.</p>

<p>The resulting cake had a mess of pink icing swirls over a vanilla cake with two pieces of Toblerone chocolate on top as makeshift 'horns'.</p>

<p>One of Laura's friends sarcastically said she had 'nailed it' while others simple 'liked' her efforts. </p>

<p>The supermarket's original unicorn cake is made in the United Kingdom and shipped to Australia, although it's temporarily unavailable online.</p>

<p>It is made using sponge cake ingredients and features gold eyelashes on the front of the dessert.</p>

<p>Customers can also purchase a caramel drip cake for $20, a chocolate and pink vanilla drip cake for $25 and the typical $4.80 white and chocolate mud cake beloved for birthday parties.</p>

<p>While it's common for amateur chefs to stack the mud cakes and DIY their own larger cakes, Laura's didn't go according to plan. </p>

<p>In the video the 36-year-old makes the dessert by stacking three of the $4.80 cakes on top of one another and topping them with icing and decorative flowers.</p>

<p>Between each layer Vanessa spread a creamy filling and smeared icing around the outside of the cake.</p>

<p>To create the ombre effect, she used three different food colourings and applied it through a piping bag before smoothing it out.</p>

<p>She then arranged artificial flowers on top of the wedding cake to complete the elegant look.</p>
