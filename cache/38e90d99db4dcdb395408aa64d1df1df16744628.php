<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Countryside Alliance has urged its 100,000 members to join in the litter-picking when the Great British September Clean begins on Friday.</p>

<p>It wants them to sign up to the huge clean-up, which runs until September 27, and has pledged to collect at least 10,000 pieces of rubbish.</p>

<p>In the campaign, run by Keep Britain Tidy and backed by the Daily Mail, we are encouraging the public and businesses to help pick up litter in their local parks, countryside and beaches.</p>

<p>The alliance has already staged a litter-pick with the Masters of the Surrey Union Hunt and their children during a walk with the hunt’s puppies in Ockley, Surrey</p>

<p>Tim Bonner, Countryside Alliance chief executive, said: ‘There are few things that annoy us as much as mindless littering in our beautiful Great British countryside.</p>

<p>‘With the lockdown offering people the opportunity to have a clear-out, fly-tipping and littering in the countryside became one of the many negative side-effects of the pandemic, particularly when local waste recycling centres were shut.</p>

<p>‘This is simply unacceptable and has proven to be a massive blight for many rural communities.</p>

<p>‘Our friends and supporters have always been keen to take practical steps and are very pleased to support the Daily Mail with this excellent campaign.’</p>

<p>The Mail and Keep Britain Tidy are encouraging the public and businesses to help pick up litter from Friday to September 27.</p>

<p>To comply with coronavirus guidelines, please stick to groups of a maximum of six people, observe social distancing rules and use litter-pickers and thick gloves where possible.</p>

<p>We also ask volunteers to wash their hands thoroughly before and after clean-ups and to carry hand sanitiser if possible.</p>

<p>You must only pick up what you can store in your bin at home unless you have arranged with your council to collect full rubbish bags. Litter should be tied up in strong waste sacks.</p>

<p>Everybody is welcome to get involved and there are no age restrictions.</p>

<p>But we ask that those who are shielding, in ‘at risk’ groups or showing symptoms of coronavirus do not litter pick and follow self-isolating guidelines. You can get involved in the country’s biggest mass clean-up in two ways:</p>

<p>1) #pledgetopick: whether it’s just 15 minutes while you walk the dog or to get away from your home-office to stretch your legs, you can feel good about helping the environment.</p>

<p>2) Host a clean-up: with up to five other people from your household or bubble, maintaining a social distance all the time.</p>

<p>Visit keepbritaintidy.org/gbseptemberclean today to #pledgetopick or to register and to find advice and information about organising a safe clean-up.</p>

<p>Afterwards, share your messages of support on social media and encourage others to get involved with the #GBSeptemberClean.</p>

<p>The alliance has already staged a litter-pick with the Masters of the Surrey Union Hunt and their children during a walk with the hunt’s puppies in Ockley, Surrey.</p>

<p>The campaign group, which supports countryside pursuits, has long warned of the pollution and litter blighting our green areas and waterways since the beginning of lockdown.</p>

<p>It will send forms to every member inviting them to take part in or organise their own litter picks in their community, on their farm or by their local river.</p>

<p>During 2019’s Great British Spring Clean, it helped organise more than 50 litter picks. </p>

<p>This year, the alliance hopes its Countryside Clean-up weekend on September 19-20 will be just as successful.</p>

<p>The 2020 Great British September Clean is encouraging everyone to hit their streets, parks and beaches in the fight against litter. It is easy to get involved in an organised event in your area, with a maximum of six people.</p>

<p>The campaign group, which supports countryside pursuits, has long warned of the pollution and litter blighting our green areas and waterways since the beginning of lockdown</p>

<p>Or you can pledge to pick up litter solo, perhaps while walking the dog or on your way to or from work. If there is not a local litter pick, you can organise one.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister and the leaders of all Westminster political parties have pledged their support, as have the National Trust, Woodland Trust and some of Britain’s top companies.</p>

<p>The Mail has long fought to protect our environment with campaigns including Turn the Tide on Plastic, Be a Tree Angel and Curb the Cups. We also successfully pressed for the plastic bag levy.</p>
