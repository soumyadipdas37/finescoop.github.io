<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Argentina legend Hernan Crespo has said that Lionel Messi should not have put his father in charge of brokering a deal away from Barcelona.</p>

<p>His dad Jorge was heavily involved after Messi dropped a bombshell by burofax that he intended to quit the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old believed there was a clause in the contract that would allow him to talk for free, but the club insisted that any interested team would have to fork out €700million.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi had dropped a bombshell on Barcelona expressing his desires to leave the club</p>

<p>Jorge Messi was involved in trying to broker a deal out of the club, but Lionel made a U-turn</p>

<p>Messi's dad held discussions with the club but in the end the six time Ballon D'or winner made a U-turn and decided to stay as he wished to avoid any legal dispute with the club he loves.</p>

<p>Crespo believes Messi should have hired a specialist to help get his move away from the club.</p>

<p>The former Chelsea, AC Milan and Parma striker told TyC Sports: 'He doesn't stop being the father and in those circumstances you need a professional.    </p>

<p>'It's not the same as an agent speaking: it's a father speaking. The agent is not going to look at family sentiment.</p>

<p>'I don't want to detract from his father, but he does not have the background in terms of these things compared to others.</p>

<p>'We're talking about directors, contracts and money. You need someone who can handle himself in that setting.'</p>

<p>Hernan Crespo thinks Messi would have got his Barcelona exit with the help of a professional</p>

<p>Messi's decision means that Barcelona now have one-year left to try and persuade the club's greatest ever player to remain at the Nou Camp, when his contract expires.</p>

<p>The Argentine striker wished to leave the club due to mounting issues both on and off the field.</p>

<p>He said in an interview with Goal that he felt his time at the club was over and 'suffered in training, games and in the dressing room'.</p>
