<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bebe Rexha was looking simply divine on Monday.  </p>

<p>The pop star, 31, shared a sizzling, curve-showcasing snap onto her Instagram account.</p>

<p>While the outfit covered up her physique from head-to-toe, it still managed to leave very little of her body to the imagination.</p>

<p>White hot! Bebe Rexha shared a sizzling, curve-showcasing snap onto her Instagram account on Monday </p>

<p>The skintight jumpsuit was made of semi-sheer white lace which clung to her hourglass figure, before flaring out into a bell bottom style at the trousers.</p>

<p>She topped up the look with a wide-brim hat atop her wavy blonde locks.</p>

<p>Bebe stood facing the Pacific blue, but gazed over the shoulder towards the camera, putting her perfectly made-up complexion on full show.</p>

<p>'I felt like this one deserved a grid post,' Bebe captioned the snap.</p>

<p>Bebe shared another snap from the festivities with her new boyfriend, filmmaker Keyan Safyari.</p>

<p>The look of love: Keyan Safyari gazed adoringly at his new girlfriend </p>

<p>Keyan smiled adoringly at Bebe as he placed a tender hand upon her waist.</p>

<p>Like Bebe, Keyan was wearing all-white.</p>

<p>While the snap didn't make it to the grid, she did post it to her Instagram stories.</p>

<p>Bebe was first linked to Keyan after the duo were spotted leaving celebrity hotspot Delilah back in March.</p>

<p>Here they come! The couple were spotted arriving to the party, held at a private residence </p>

<p>In 2017, Bebe said she had been single since 2015.</p>

<p>'I haven't had a boyfriend since,' she told KISS FM UK. 'I'm an old school romantic. I don't like to just like throw my heart around or my anything else.'</p>

<p>Bebe has been candid about her sexual fluidity as well.</p>

<p>'I try to keep one thing personal to me. But I consider myself fluid. Until I find "the one," I can't just say what I am. I just want to find someone I love and who loves me — and I don't care if that's a boy or a girl,' she told Health in May 2019.</p>
