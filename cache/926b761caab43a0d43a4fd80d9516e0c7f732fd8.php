<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A London-based black TikTok star of Nigerian heritage has revealed she's been called a 'monkey' and a 'slave' on social media and is told to 'go back home' 10 times a week.</p>

<p>UK-born student Naomi Eluwa, who is currently in her second year studying International History and Politics at the University of Leeds, has almost 51,000 followers on TikTok and regularly shares videos intended to educate people about racism.</p>

<p>But as a result, Naomi - who goes by <?php echo e('@'); ?>nayyeeohhmeee on the platform - claims she's been subjected to vile abuse purely due to the colour of her skin.</p>

<p>Speaking on the new BBC Three documentary 'Go Back To Where You Came From', she told reporter Reha Kansara: 'I received a comment telling me to go back to Africa.</p>

<p>'I've been called a monkey, I've been called a slave online, I've been told that no amount of make-up can hide my disgusting complexion.</p>

<p>'I've been told that I should bleach my skin, and I've been called ugly just based on the fact I am black.'</p>

<p>Naomi joined TikTok to share videos of herself performing the popular dance routines. </p>

<p>But after the death of George Floyd in the US at the hands of white police officers, which sparked widespread Black Lives Matter protests in the UK, Naomi decided to use her platform for activism and to educate people to have 'a better understanding of what it means to be black in the UK in 2020'.</p>

<p>'I'd always joked that I'd become TikTok famous by doing the dances and that I would get lots of free clothes from it, and then overnight I gained 7,000 followers by just ranting online about racism in this country, venting my frustration,' she explained.</p>

<p>Asked how often she gets told to 'go back to where she came from', Naomi replied: 'I would say about 10 times a week.'</p>

<p>She said her presence on TikTok has amplified the racist abuse she receives, adding: 'I think I'd heard that comment once in my life and then once I got bigger on TikTok it became almost a daily occurrence [that] I received that comment.'</p>

<p>Admitting she was 'deeply offended and hurt' the first time she was told to 'go home' on the social media platform, Naomi said she's now become 'very used' to racism.</p>

<p>Asked how often she gets told to 'go back to where she came from', Naomi replied: 'I would say about 10 times a week.' She produced a video to make the point she is a British citizen (right)</p>

<p>Speaking about the impact of the hurtful words, Naomi said: 'This is my home, this is my country, I love this country, they're basically saying you don't belong here because you're not white and it just removes a sense of belonging from this country.</p>

<p>'But now when I receive the comment... I'm not even impacted by it that much anymore because I just expect to receive it at least once a day now.</p>

<p>'I never thought I would be used to racism, but I am now very used to racism, especially from strangers online.' </p>
