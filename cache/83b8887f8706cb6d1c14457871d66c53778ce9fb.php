<p>A man has been arrested in south China after he was caught on camera pushing his intellectually disabled son into the sea in a bid to stage an accident and claim insurance money</p>

<p>Hainan police today have found the body of Yang’s 38-year-old son and detained the suspect amid an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>On Monday, the authorities received a report from the Chinese father, reportedly to be 64, who claimed his intellectually disabled son had accidentally fallen into the sea and disappeared.</p>

<p>During the investigation, the officers found the CCTV footage of Yang’s son being pushed off the dock by a man wearing the same clothing as the father. </p>

<p>The parent also appeared unusually calm without showing any sadness or devastation.</p>

<p>Yang initially denied the allegation and repeatedly asked the police to issue a formal notice proving his son’s ‘accidental disappearance’.</p>

<p>The man eventually admitted that he had planned the incident with a distant relative in the hope of claiming insurance money for his own use. </p>

<p>On Monday, the authorities received a report from the Chinese father, reportedly to be 64, who claimed his intellectually disabled son had accidentally fallen into the sea</p>

<p>The father, originally from southwest China’s Hunan province, came up with the idea of faking his son’s disappearance when he visited the southern Chinese island Hainan in mid-September. </p>

<p>He contacted his distant relative, known by his surname Li, and offered the family member 6,000 yuan (£685) to help him do the job, reports said.</p>

<p>After they travelled to Hainan with Yang’s son, the three of them went to a local dock in the wee hours of September 28.</p>

<p>Chilling footage initially shows the father signalling his relative to push his son, who was peeing while standing on the edge of the dock.</p>

<p>After the relative hesitated to take action, Yang walked up and pushed his son into the sea.</p>

<p>The suspect later confessed to officers that he had bought personal accident insurance for his son last year.</p>

<p>‘[He said] his child had intellectual disabilities from a young age and was a heavy burden to the family,’ an officer told Pear Video. ‘He wanted to claim the insurance money to support himself after his child ‘accidentally died’.’</p>

<p>The authorities have arrested Yang and Li amid an ongoing investigation. The son’s body has been found today, according to Chinese media, citing the police.</p>
