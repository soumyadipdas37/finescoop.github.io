<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A millionaire construction tycoon who escaped Victoria's coronavirus lockdown by sailing to Queensland on a luxury superyacht has been fined by police. </p>

<p>Mark Simonds and his entourage embarked on a 15-day sailing trip up Australia's east coast on his 30-metre long superyacht, Lady Pamela. </p>

<p>The vessel docked at six stops along the coast before it arrived at its final destination at Gold Coast Marina on August 25.</p>

<p>The multimillionaire and six others on board were not allowed to disembark until they were tested for coronavirus by Queensland Health medical staff.</p>

<p>On the same day, NSW Police launched an investigation into the movements of the vessel while it was in NSW waters. </p>

<p>Inquiries found the travellers illegally disembarked the superyacht in NSW on three occasions - at Eden on August 12, Port Stephens on August 16 and Yamba on August 21. </p>

<p>On Friday, NSW Police issued nine penalty infringement notices to six of the people on board the yacht. </p>

<p>'Nine Penalty Infringement Notices have been issued after crew members and passengers on board a vessel travelling along the NSW coast from Victoria disembarked onto NSW soil, contrary to current Public Health Orders,' a statement read. </p>

<p>The 64-year-old skipper was fined $3,000 and the 61-year-old owner of the vessel was hit with a $2,000 penalty.</p>

<p>Three passengers, aged 51, 20 and 18, were fined $1,000 as well as a 40-year-old crew member. </p>

<p>The vessel docked at six stops along the coast before it arrived at its final destination at Gold Coast Marina on August 25</p>

<p>The vessel was initially granted an exemption to carry out routine maintenance and repairs when it arrived on the Gold Coast but that was later revoked. </p>

<p>Mr Simonds' wife Cheryl, their son, and Hannah Fox, daughter of Linfox executive chairman Peter Fox were among the six other passengers and crew.</p>

<p>The Simonds family has a Gold Coast property, while Ms Fox's family is currently renting a home in nearby Palm Beach.</p>

<p>Victorian and NSW residents are currently banned from entering Queensland as both states have been declared virus hotspots. </p>

<p>Earlier on Friday, the skipper was handed a court notice by Queensland Police. </p>

<p>Police allege he breached the Public Health Act by providing false information to an emergency officer. </p>

<p>The 64-year-old is due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on September 11. </p>
