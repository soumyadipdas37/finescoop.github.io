<p>After racking up over $500,000 in one month, the beauty spoiled herself with the newly-delivered Mercedes-Benz roadster.   </p>

<p>'I earned over $500,000 in June. I haven't had a month that big but I am fairly consistent with my earning from month to month,' she told The Daily Telegraph last month.  </p>

<p>'I will keep on working and posting videos. I don't see that type of money disappearing or stopping anytime soon and that is why I made the decision to buy the car.'  </p>

<p>Pay cheque: 'I earned over $500,000 in June. I haven't had a month that big but I am fairly consistent with my earning from month to month,' she told The Daily Telegraph last month</p>

<p>The Queenslander was once Australia's first female professional V8 Supercars driver, having famously partnered with Swiss racer Simona de Silvestro at Bathurst in 2015.</p>

<p>But after years of financial struggles, Renee abandoned her racing career and began posting nude pictures on adult website OnlyFans in late 2019.</p>

<p>OnlyFans is a subscription-based platform which allows 'creators' to earn money by sharing pornographic content for a monthly fee.  </p>

<p>Making money: She now earns up to $25,000 per week selling explicit content on OnlyFans. Pictured left in September 2015, right in March 2020 </p>

<p>Speaking about her decision to quit Supercars, Renee told Daily Mail Australia in July she 'just couldn't afford it anymore'.</p>

<p>'I had to come up with $600,000 a year to race,' she said. 'I had to get my own sponsors and any crashes or scratches I got on the car I had to pay for myself.</p>

<p>'We had insurance but the excess was so high that the team bosses used to tell me, 'Don't crash – but if you do, make sure you write it off.' Just a minor crash could cost $10,000. It's a savage sport,' she finished.</p>
