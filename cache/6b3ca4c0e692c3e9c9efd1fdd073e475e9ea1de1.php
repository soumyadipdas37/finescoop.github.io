<p>Singletons in China are being hung out to dry by their matchmaking parents, who are advertising details about them on a washing-line in a bid to marry them off.</p>

<p>The bizarre dating ritual takes place at People's Park in Shanghai, where parents peg out information about their grown-up sons and daughters in the hope of finding them an eligible life partner.</p>

<p>The adverts include details such as their child's age, height, educational background, profession and income.</p>

<p>Good on paper: Parents in Shanghai are drawing up laminated adverts to promote their sons and daughters to potential partners</p>

<p>Young wives' tales: Parents seeking the daughter-in-law of their dreams will find a selection of potential spouses on display</p>

<p>With some of the adverts attached to small packages, it seems some parents find it hard to keep their child's qualities to just one sheet of A4</p>

<p>The typical requirement of a prospective groom is that he be a 'responsible man with stable income' or someone 'who owns an apartment and a car'.</p>

<p>Women, meanwhile, are required to be 'kind, have a stable job and preferably hold a bachelor's degree'.</p>

<p>The keen parents then scan the dating adverts and chat to other parents in an attempt to match their son or daughter with a potential spouse.</p>

<p>Something for the weekend? The matchmaking parents gather on Saturdays and Sundays to survey the city's singletons</p>

<p>High expectations: The advertisers generally want wives who are 'kind, have a stable job and preferably hold a bachelor's degree'</p>

<p>When it comes to husbands, the ideal candidate is a 'responsible man with stable income' or someone 'who owns an apartment and a car'</p>

<p>Narrowing the options: Keen mothers and fathers reckon they can help their child find a life partner by chatting to like-minded parents</p>

<p>Vital statistics: The adverts include thoughtful details such as the son or daughter's height, job...and salary</p>

<p>One parent, Ma Jianhua, 55, who was attempting to find his son a wife, told China Daily: 'I first came here six months ago after reading about the park's matchmaking activities in the newspaper.</p>

<p>'Since then I have been coming here almost every weekend. On days that I can't make it, my wife steps in for me.</p>

<p>'My son is too busy to date girls, so I am here on his behalf.</p>

<p>'Although my son and I have different tastes, I can at least narrow down some of the girls who meet his requirements, by speaking to the girl's parents. After all, a woman's manner and character are often influenced by their parents.'</p>

<p>Love letters: The parents don't have much to go on, but as one father put it, 'it's a good platform'</p>

<p>Well, it's cheaper than a personal ad: The park's green spaces provide an healthy environment for partner-hunting</p>

<p>Ma said his 28-year-old son was looking for a caring girl aged between 24 and 26, with a bachelor's degree.</p>

<p>He hasn't had any luck so far, as while he has introduced his son to several girls, none have made the cut.</p>

<p>He said: 'I will not give up, as a father, I will not feel comfortable if I don't do something for my son.</p>

<p>'I know very well that there are all kinds of people here, but it's a good platform. Nowhere else in the city can you find so many candidates.</p>

<p>'Besides, I believe matchmaking works. Some of the parents I used to see are no longer here. I think they must have found someone.'</p>

<p>Stiff competition: The number of singletons may be high, but for these parents, that's an advantage</p>
