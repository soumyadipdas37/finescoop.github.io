<p>A savvy home cook has shared her go-to recipe for delicious chicken wings and how she makes the skin perfectly crispy every time using an air fryer (pictured)</p>

<p>The recipe from Cook It Real Good is simple to follow, uses few ingredients and takes less than half an hour to complete.</p>

<p>To season the chicken wings, a combination of salt, pepper, garlic powder and baking powder is used.</p>

<p>But before dousing the chicken in the dry rub seasoning, Cassie said it's important to thoroughly dry the meat with paper towel. </p>

<p>She also said she didn't use any oil, used Mckenzie's baking powder instead, before cooking the meat on a low heat followed by a high heat.</p>

<p>'150 [degrees] for five minutes, then 200 for ten to 15 minutes until cooked through and crispy,' she said.</p>

<p>'I start with low heat, then finish with high heat - the fat in the chicken skin will be rendered and drained without overcooking the meat.' </p>

<p>Many were impressed with how simple the dish is to make and commented words of praise on the Facebook post.</p>

<p>'Yum! They look amazing and I'll probably try it tomorrow,' one woman said</p>

<p>'These look good,' another said, a third added: 'Looks yummy! Thank you.' </p>

<p>Thoroughly dry the wings on a paper towel before adding seasoning</p>

<p>Don't use any oil – the wings render fat while cooking</p>

<p>Use baking powder, not baking soda – this helps the chicken to brown and reacts with any moisture left to crisp the meat</p>
