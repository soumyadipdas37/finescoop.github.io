<p>This is the warning of groups Greenpeace and Transport &amp; Environment, who argue for hybrids to be added to the upcoming ban on new petrol and diesel cars.</p>

<p>Hybrid cars run off of a battery which can be charged either from the electricity grid, or via their conventionally-fuelled onboard engine.</p>

<p>While they are often marketed as low-carbon alternatives to traditional vehicles, the groups' analysis suggests that a typical hybrid emits 188.3 grams of CO2 per mile. </p>

<p>This is compared with the figure of 70.8 cited from laboratory examinations — a discrepancy that the groups blame on the vehicles' limited range.</p>

<p>In addition, they said, hybrid owners do not recharge their vehicles' batteries often enough — increasing their emission levels when driven in reality.</p>

<p>UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated that a ban on the sales of new petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles could be brought forward from 2040.</p>

<p>The accelerated time frame would help meet carbon reduction targets.</p>

<p>'Plug-in hybrids are the car industry's wolf in sheep's clothing,' said Greenpeace UK's head of politics, Rebecca Newsom.</p>

<p>'They may seem a much more environmentally friendly choice, but false claims of lower emissions are a ploy by car manufacturers to go on producing SUVs and petrol and diesel engines,' she explained.</p>

<p>'It's great that the Government is considering bringing the ban on new petrol and diesel vehicles forward to 2030 — doing so is one of the most important things the Government can do now to help tackle the climate emergency.'</p>

<p>'But ministers mustn't be duped by plug-in hybrids when making this critical decision,' Ms Newsom continued.</p>

<p>It's imperative that they are included in the 2030 ban, and that support is provided to enable workers to transition to electric vehicle manufacturing.'</p>

<p>'Plug-in hybrid vehicles are not electric cars and claims that, in cities, plug-in hybrids have zero emissions are just mischievous, misleading marketing,' said Transport and Environment's UK director, Greg Archer.</p>

<p>'Unless the battery is frequently charged, these fake electric cars are actually worse for the climate than conventional cars.'</p>

<p>There are differences between how cars perform in lab tests compared with out in the real-world, acknowledged Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders chief executive Mike Hawes.</p>

<p>However, he accused pressure groups of analysing figures that 'government and industry abandoned two years ago' in favour of a 'more robust' test.</p>

<p>'Even the report's assumed figures show plug-in hybrid vehicles provide more than a 30 per cent overall reduction in emissions compared to petrol or diesel,' he said.</p>

<p>'Plug-in hybrid vehicles also provide a flexibility few other technologies can yet match with extended range for longer, out of town, journeys and battery power in urban areas, reducing emissions and improving city air quality.'</p>

<p>Their range and performance, he asserted, 'will continue to improve — meaning that, for many users, they are the essential stepping stone to a fully electric vehicle.'</p>

<p>A hybrid vehicle has two power sources – a petrol engine and an electric motor – combining to propel the cars forward.</p>

<p>By switching seamlessly between pure electric power at low speeds and efficient petrol power when speeds increase, these vehicles not only save fuel and money, but they also reduce CO2 emissions. </p>

<p>Hybrids can be self-charging which means that every moment you are driving, your battery is charging, by using technology such as a regenerative braking system, which recovers energy that would normally be lost and stores it in the battery for later use.</p>

<p> Self-charging hybrids do not need to be plugged in.  </p>

<p>A plug-in hybrid gets all the benefits of being a hybrid but also has a charge point so you can extend the range of your car by plugging in at home or at one of the nation’s electric charge points.</p>
