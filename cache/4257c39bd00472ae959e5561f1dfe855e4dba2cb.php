<p>After the birth of her sons, Jasmine Campbell became aware of how much waste her young family was producing.</p>

<p>Eager to reduce her environmental footprint, the mother from North Lakes, 26 kilometres north of Brisbane CBD, started 'upcycling' furniture and accessories from leftover materials.</p>

<p>Ms Campbell now sells her wares on Modern Mila, a Facebook page that features inventive creations like stylish coffee tables fashioned out of recycled tyres.</p>

<p>The repurposed wheels - for which Ms Campbell charges $150 - are wrapped in woven twine and fitted with a sealed bottom and removable lid, creating a hidden storage space in the middle of the living room.</p>

<p>'Like all my upcycle projects I'm really quite passionate about these guys!' Ms Campbell posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>'It's so hard to get trendy furniture at a reasonable cost and made sustainably. Plus it comes with that additional storage space under the lid.'</p>

<p>Photos of the tables have already attracted attention on social media, with many tagging their friends and suggesting they buy one.</p>

<p>'I think seeing the tyre on the inside is like a hidden gem when you open the lid, you don't expect it!' one woman replied. </p>

<p>A second said 'amazing, what a great use of old tyres' while a third added: 'How clever!' </p>

<p>'They look amazing, great job as usual,' said a fourth.</p>

<p>Not content with just one sustainable creation, Ms Campbell also uses the scraps leftover from her coffee tables to make indoor plant pots.</p>

<p>Other popular pieces on her Facebook page include soy wax candles hand-poured into discarded jars and earrings made from old denim.</p>
