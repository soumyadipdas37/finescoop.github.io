<p>Tracey, who shares nine-year-old daughter Grace with ex-husband Jacob Anthonisz, described the pregnancy as 'beautiful news' she'd long waited for.  </p>

<p>'I have always believed in second chances and my second baby I've been waiting so long for,' she added. </p>

<p>'My daughter Grace is going to be an amazing big sister and I'm so so grateful to be experiencing pregnancy and motherhood again with my love Nate x.' </p>

<p>Now that's an announcement! She also posted a picture of her ultrasounds and a baby onesie that read: 'Coming soon'</p>

<p>While the pregnancy may come as a surprise for some, Tracey revealed she wanted to have a child with Nathan in January last year. </p>

<p>'I definitely want more children, a hundred per cent! I'm only 36, I've got quite a few years left,' she told WHO magazine.</p>

<p>'I decided that going forward I definitely want kids so I need to be with someone where that's an option. That door is open and that's really important to me.' </p>

<p>Old flame: Tracey previously dated Nathan Constable (left) in high school before rekindling their romance in January 2019</p>

<p>However, Tracey confessed she wasn't planning on getting married anytime soon.</p>

<p>She explained that after two failed 'marriages' - including her non-legally binding nuptials to Dean Wells on MAFS - she was reluctant to tie the knot again.</p>

<p>'I would much prefer to build a strong foundation in a partnership and have a family over marriage,' she said. 'Marriage, for me, doesn't make a partnership anymore. So ever since MAFS my value system around that has completely changed.'</p>

<p>Tracey previously dated Nathan in high school before rekindling their romance at the start of last year.</p>

<p>Long time coming: Tracey, who has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship, previously told Who magazine she is keen to have more children but is reluctant to marry again after her experience on MAFS. She is pictured with her MAFS 'husband' Dean Wells</p>
