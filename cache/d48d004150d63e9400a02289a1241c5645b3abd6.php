<p>Infections in Arkansas spiked by 1,600 on Sunday, bringing the state's total to more than 75,700.</p>

<p>Prior to the Labor Day holiday weekend, health officials had warned that any potential increase would likely set the stage for what is to come in the fall.</p>

<p>While deaths are declining nationally, fatalities related to COVID-19 are a lagging indicator and can potentially rise several weeks after new cases.</p>

<p>The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is predicting that deaths will rise to more 378,00 by the end of the year. </p>

<p>The model forecasts that more than 114,000 lives could be saved if the majority of Americans wore masks but epidemiologists have already warned that mask-wearing is already declining across the country.</p>

<p>The death rate projected by the IHME model, which has been cited by the White House Coronavirus Task Force, would more than triple the current death rate of some 850 per day.</p>

<p>Health officials are still keeping tabs on any potential surges from the Labor Day holiday weekend.</p>

<p>South Dakota's cases are rising against after declining rapidly in early September. Cases spiked in mid-August. Nebraska's cases have been spiking to near-record levels throughout September. There has been an uptick of cases across Idaho after declining since mid-July</p>

<p>Cases in Missouri have been rising to near peak levels. There has been an uptick in cases in Texas after the hospot state saw a huge decline following the summer surge that, in part, drove the national trends upwards </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a Missouri biker festival that drew about 125,000 people over the weekend has sparked fears that the event may become a 'super spreader' for the coronavirus after photos showed many maskless participants. </p>

<p>The 14th Annual BikeFest Lake of the Ozarks took place from September 16-20.</p>

<p>According to the event's website, there were more than 300 bars and restaurants involved in the festivities. </p>

<p>Last week's biker festival comes just a month after the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally that was held in South Dakota. </p>

<p>As the push for a vaccine continues, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its guidance on Monday, warning that COVID-19 could spread through airborne particles that can remain suspended in the air and travel beyond six feet. </p>

<p>The agency previously said the virus mainly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. </p>

<p>The updated guidance, posted on the agency's website on Friday, also recommended that people use air purifiers to reduce airborne germs indoors to avoid the disease from spreading. </p>
