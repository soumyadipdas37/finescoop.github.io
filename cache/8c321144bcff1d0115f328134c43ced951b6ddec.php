<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kate Ferdinand has revealed she is having a baby boy with husband Rio. </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram on Wednesday, the former TOWIE star, 29, revealed the big news as she shared pictures from a gender reveal party.  </p>

<p>The pair were seen in their garden hugging beneath billowing streams of blue confetti alongside Rio's children from his first marriage: Lorenz, 14, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia.</p>

<p>Poking fun at the now male-heavy household, Kate captioned the shots: '..... it’s a boy me and tia are outnumbered'.</p>

<p>Her shoot came after Kate and former footballer Rio, 41, reportedly splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.</p>

<p>The celebrity couple are said to want extra security at their mansion for their growing family.</p>

<p>They reportedly enlisted the help of a special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, to buy the pair of black German shepherds.  </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'One is already at their home, and the second will be joining shortly.</p>

<p>'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!</p>

<p>'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'</p>
