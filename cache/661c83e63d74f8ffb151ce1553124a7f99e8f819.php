<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britons travelling to the European Union could soon face quarantine on arrival across the board as countries consider whether to adopt a standardised threshold for imposing self-isolation rules. </p>

<p>The European Commission is pushing member states to adopt its recently published 'traffic light' quarantine system so that the entire bloc uses the same criteria for restricting travel. </p>

<p>The EU's system would see quarantine measures applied to all arrivals from countries which have more than 50 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over the previous two weeks and a positive test rate above three per cent. </p>

<p>A recent surge in cases means the UK currently has an infection rate of 51.1 per 100,000 and a positive test rate of six per cent - both above the EU's threshold. </p>

<p>Ireland is expected to announce its new quarantine rules today with reports suggesting Dublin will adopt the European Commission's approach. </p>

<p>The European Commission wants European countries to adopt a standardised system for imposing quarantine on travellers. The threshold would be set at more than 50 cases per 100,000 people. A coronavirus test centre is pictured at Brussels Airport yesterday</p>

<p>The EU is proposing to introduce a standardised system for quarantine.</p>

<p>It would see arrivals from countries with a rate of more than 50 cases per 100,000 told to self-isolate.</p>

<p>These are the current infection levels per 100,000 in European countries.</p>

<p>Spain: 270.7</p>

<p>France: 153.9</p>

<p>Czechia: 111</p>

<p>Romania: 86</p>

<p>Belgium: 70.6</p>

<p>Netherlands: 69.2</p>

<p>Austria: 69.1</p>

<p>Portugal: 53.9</p>

<p>UK: 51.1</p>

<p>Ireland: 45.4</p>

<p>Italy: 32.4</p>

<p>Sweden: 22.7</p>

<p>Germany: 21.7</p>

<p>Poland: 19.2 </p>

<p>The Telegraph said France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands are all in favour of a standardised system. </p>

<p>However, it is thought they would want to retain the ability to act unilaterally on quarantine so they could alter restrictions when they see fit.  </p>

<p>The expected move by Ireland comes as Finland moves to roll out updated quarantine measures from this weekend. </p>

<p>Its system will see arrivals from countries with 25 cases per 100,000 having to quarantine and get tested.   </p>

<p>The European Commission published its 'traffic light' plans at the start of September in a bid to harmonise rules across Europe. </p>

<p>Its system would see countries with an infection rate above 50 per 100,000 added to a 'red list' while countries with a rate between 25 and 50 would be on the 'amber list'. </p>

<p>Countries with an infection rate of lower than 25 per 100,000 would be added to the 'green list'.</p>

<p>People travelling from countries on the 'red list' would be told to either quarantine or get tested.  </p>

<p>Under the European Commission's proposals, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control would publish a map every week with the latest colour codes applied to each country. </p>

<p>The bloc said it wanted to introduce a 'well-coordinated, predictable and transparent approach to travel restrictions' which would replace the current 'kaleidoscope of individual measures'.   </p>

<p>Paul Charles, chief executive of the travel consultancy The PC Agency, said the idea of a consensus being struck on quarantine is 'good news' but 'bad news for travellers leaving the UK because our numbers are getting worse'.</p>

<p>The UK Government currently uses a threshold of 20 cases per 100,000 when it makes decisions on whether to add or remove countries from its quarantine list.   </p>
