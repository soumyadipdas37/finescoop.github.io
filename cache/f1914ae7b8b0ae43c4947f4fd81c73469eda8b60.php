<p>It also found young people are more likely to be superspreaders of Covid-19 than people over 60. </p>

<p>Scientists have been discovering over the course of the pandemic that a small percentage of patients are responsible for a large amount of transmissions. </p>

<p>This latest study mapped Covid-19 mobility data for five counties in the US state of Georgia between March and May. </p>

<p>Analysis of almost 10,000 cases of Covid-19 reveals one fifth of all infections come from just two per cent of infected patients. </p>

<p>Pictured, the infectiousness of younger patients (&lt;60 y) relative to the older patients (≥60 y). On average, younger people were found to be 2.78 times more infectious but in Dougherty this figure was as high as four times </p>

<p>Experts from Emory University write in their study, published in the journal PNAS: 'We analyze reported cases, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the state of Georgia.'</p>

<p>'Overall, about two per cent of cases were directly responsible for 20 per cent of all infections. </p>

<p>'We estimate that the infected nonelderly cases (older than 60 years) may be 2.78 times more infectious than the elderly, and the former tend to be the main driver of superspreading.'</p>

<p>Data was sourced from the Georgia Department of Public Health (GDPH) and spanned the state's five counties with the largest numbers of cases. </p>

<p>These were Cobb, DeKalb, Gwinnett, and Fulton in the built-up metro Atlanta area and one, Dougherty, in rural southwest Georgia.</p>

<p>It totalled almost 10,000 symptomatic cases and analysis proved the R rate was around 3.3 before the shelter-in-place order was issued.</p>

<p>Every infectious disease is given a reproduction number, which is known as R0 - pronounced 'R nought'.</p>

<p>It is a value that represents how many people one sick person will, on average, infect. </p>

<p>WHAT IS THE R0 FOR COVID-19? </p>

<p>The R0 value for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was estimated by the Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team to be 2.4 in the UK before lockdown started.  </p>

<p>But some experts analysing outbreaks across the world have estimated it could be closer to the 6.6 mark. </p>

<p>Estimates of the R0 vary because the true size of the pandemic remains a mystery, and how fast the virus spreads depends on the environment. </p>

<p>It will spread faster in a densely-populated city where people travel on the subway than it will in a rural community where people drive everywhere.</p>

<p>HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO OTHER VIRUSES? </p>

<p>It is thought to be at least three times more contagious than the coronavirus that causes MERS (0.3 - 0.8).   </p>

<p>Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and has an R0 value of 12 to 18 if left uncontrolled. Widespread vaccination keeps it suppressed in most developed countries.</p>

<p>Chickenpox's R0 is estimated to be between 10 and 12, while seasonal flu has a value of around 1.5.  </p>

<p>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO HAVE A LOW R0? </p>

<p>The higher the R0 value, the harder it is for health officials control the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>A number lower than one means the outbreak will run out of steam and be forced to an end. </p>

<p>This is because the infectious disease will quickly run out of new victims to strike. </p>

<p>HOW DOES A LOCKDOWN BRING DOWN THE R0?</p>

<p>The UK's draconian lockdown, imposed on March 23 has slowed Britain's coronavirus crisis, studies show.</p>

<p>Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine last month analysed the virus in the UK.</p>

<p>They estimated each infected patient may now only be passing COVID-19 on to 0.62 others, down from 2.6.</p>

<p>The team said the virus was struggling to spread because people were having less contact with others.</p>

<p>They used a survey of 1,300 people who were asked to list what human contact they had in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>This was compared to a similar survey done in 2005 to give an idea of how it had changed because of lockdown.</p>

<p>The R rate was worse in the rural area of Dougherty, where it was as high as 5.2.</p>

<p>R rate is a term used by scientists to describe how infectious a disease is and fast it is spreading. </p>

<p>It represents the average number of healthy people that are infected by a single infected person. </p>

<p>The higher it is, the more rampant the virus rages and the only hope of squashing the pandemic is to keep it under one. </p>

<p>Superspreading, the researchers explain, is where 'certain individuals disproportionately infect a large number of secondary cases relative to an “average” infectious individual'.</p>

<p>To study this, the researchers assessed the so-called k-rate, which is different to the R rate and refers directly to the importance of superspreaders.  </p>

<p>K captures variation in the way a disease is spread as not everyone passes the virus on at the same speed, and not every environment poses the same level of risk.</p>

<p>If the K figure is close to one, as with influenza, a virus will move relatively evenly through the population without variation. </p>

<p>'Generally speaking, a lower k corresponds to a higher degree of superspreading, and k less than one implies substantial superspreading,' the researchers explain. </p>

<p>The rural area of Dougherty had a worrying k rate of 0.27, indicating superspreading events played a major role in the localised outbreak. </p>

<p>It is believed this may be linked to a funeral in the area which brought people together and saw the virus pass rapidly from one person to the next.  </p>

<p>New York Times reports that a mourner came to the region to pay their respects to the passing of a a retired janitor, Andrew Jerome Mitchell, at the service on February 29.</p>

<p>Shortly after, while the virus got to work, there was an explosion in cases. </p>

<p>Patient zero of this outbreak remains a mystery, but their presence led to dozens of cases.</p>

<p>A previous study from researchers in Hong Kong suggests the influence of superspreaders could be even more severe. </p>

<p>Their study published in June found 20 per cent of sufferers are responsible for 80 per cent of transmissions. </p>

<p>Why some people become superspreaders and others do not, it is currently unknown what makes someone a superspreader.  </p>

<p>One theory is based on viral load, the amount of coronavirus a person carries, and states that the higher it is, the more infectious a person is. </p>

<p>A recent study looked at the level of viral load in children and found youngsters were shown to carry large amounts of the coronavirus in their nose,</p>

<p>Scientists say this may suggest they have an increased ability to transmit the virus to others.</p>

<p>Infected children with mild symptoms even had bigger viral loads than adults who had been hospitalised by the life-threatening disease.</p>

<p>The authors of this study, from Massachusetts General Hospital in America, say this could indicate children are secret superspreaders of coronavirus.  </p>
