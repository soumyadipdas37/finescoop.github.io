<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona's pursuit of Memphis Depay appears to have hit a major stumbling block after Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas claimed the club can't make an offer due to their finances being crippled by the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>The Spanish giants have been in pursuit of the Lyon winger this summer as they look to bolster their attacking line - with new boss Ronald Koeman hoping to reunite with Depay after coaching him with Holland.</p>

<p>However, Lyon's president has poured cold water over Barcelona's £28million move after claiming that Josep Bartomeu called him to say that they can't make an offer for Depay due to the financial fall-out from the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>Responding to an article over the pursuit of Depay, Aulas wrote on Twitter: 'The president of Barca told me on Sunday that Barca was suffering a lot from the Covid crisis and had no possibility of making an offer.'</p>

<p>Aulas' words have put Depay into limbo this summer, with Manchester United reportedly having no intention of using their buy-back option on the 26-year-old.</p>

<p>According to talkSPORT, United have no interest in pursuing a move for Depay after he endured a horrid two seasons at Old Trafford between 2015-2017.</p>

<p>United had buy-back and sell-on clauses included in the deal when Depay joined the French side for around £17m. </p>

<p>The Lyon chief claimed Josep Bartomeu called him to say Barcelona can't make a bid for Depay</p>

<p>Depay has caught the attention of Barcelona thanks to his fine form in recent times for Ligue 1 outfit Lyon.</p>

<p>Since joining Lyon, Depay has shown much more maturity and has improved from his days at Old Trafford, scoring 57 goals in 140 appearances.</p>

<p>Depay made a fantastic start to the new season for Lyon scoring a hat-trick in their opening day 4-1 victory over Dijon while also netting in Tuesday's 2-1 defeat against Montpellier.</p>

<p>If Barcelona want to get their man, they will have to raise vital funds in the transfer market before it closes - with the likes of Luis Suarez and Arturo Vidal on the brink of leaving. </p>
