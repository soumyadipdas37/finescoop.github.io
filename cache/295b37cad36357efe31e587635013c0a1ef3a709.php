<p>On hold again: Filming on the crime thriller, which stars the rapper, had only just resumed in July after shutting down in March amid the pandemic but has since shut down again</p>

<p>Midnight In The Switchgrass stars Megan Fox and Bruce Willis as detectives trying to break up a child trafficking ring, whose investigation brings them across the path of a notorious Texas serial killer.  </p>

<p>The crime thriller also stars the likes of Machine Gun Kelly, Emile Hirsch, Lukas Haas and Sistine Stallone. </p>

<p>The film has hit headlines in recent months not just for its production delays but due to the blossoming relationship between Megan and Kelly - real name Colson Baker.  </p>

<p>Megan recently admitted that she knew 'something' would happen between herself and the rapper on the set of the upcoming movie.</p>

<p>The Transformers star, who shares sons Noah, seven, Bodhi, six, and Journey, four, with her estranged husband Brian Austin Green, said: 'I was like, "Who is going to play this role?" And he was like, "Oh, we just got Machine Gun Kelly," and immediately, I was like, "Uh oh."</p>

<p>'Yeah, because I knew — I could feel that some wild s*** was going to happen to me from that meeting, but I wasn't yet sure what. I just felt it like, deep in my soul — that something was going to come from that. So then, we met on set.'</p>

<p>Director Emmett added the pair are 'very happy' in their romance while talking with Entertainment Tonight.</p>

<p>The film producer said that it was 'sweet and beautiful' to see the two lovebirds together. 'They’re very passionate about one another and very happy, and I mean, it’s really sweet to see that I had a little hand in that,' he said via video chat.</p>

<p>'The chemistry [on set] was second to none, but I just thought, I’m a great director!' </p>

<p>'I didn’t know there were these undertones and all that, and now, we spend a lot of time with them since they’ve been together and it’s really sweet and beautiful, and I’m really happy for both of them.' </p>

<p>Megan and Kelly's relationship is said to have come as a shock to her estranged husband Brian who she began dating in 2004 after meeting on the set of Hope &amp; Faith. </p>

<p>The couple wed in 2010 but have been on and off since Megan filed for divorce in 2015. In May this year, they confirmed their separation. </p>

<p>Brian has since been linked to Australian Instagram model Tina Louise.</p>
