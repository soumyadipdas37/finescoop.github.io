<p>Yvie, 47, briefly appeared on the show to attend a life drawing class with Angie, 30, and the show's remaining suitors. </p>

<p>'I went on a date with Angie and eight guys - what's not to love? And Ciarran [Stott] got naked! There was nothing too exciting in that, believe me, but it was something. Someone got naked,' she joked in an interview with Daily Mail Australia on Friday.</p>

<p>But Yvie revealed Ciarran, 26, was never supposed to strip off for the life drawing class, and said the show had actually hired a professional model.   </p>

<p>'It was so funny, there was a guy out the back in a robe. He cracked the s**ts! Well, he cracked the sads. He was just put to the side. They bumped him!' she recounted.</p>

<p>'He was there waiting, and then Osher's gone, "Would anyone like to volunteer?" Ciarran's put his hand straight up, and all the guys rolled their eyes. </p>

<p>'They obviously knew him well already and just went, "Yeah, we knew he would." So there's this dude in a robe out the back kind of going, "Oh."' </p>

<p>Yvie admitted she felt bad for the guy, after he missed his opportunity to appear on The Bachelorette. </p>

<p>'It makes you wonder what happened to him, the poor thing. I should look him up. He's probably got a GoFundMe. Maybe it's on his Tinder profile - "I nearly was on The Bachelorette in the nude",' she joked.</p>

<p>'Poor guy. We never even got to see him. He would have manscaped the hell out of himself! Got a tan... He might be going to therapy now.'</p>

<p>Yvie said the man just left and went home after Ciarran decided to step in as the model, but she argued they should've been given a choice as to who would pose. </p>

<p>'It would've been nice to get an option. Couldn't he have just dropped the robe and we could have gone, "Yeah, we'll choose which one we want,"' she added. </p>
