<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Minnesota elementary school teacher has been accused of physically assaulting three black students in her second-grade class and segregating them from their white peers.  </p>

<p>The alleged abuse by Geraldine Cook, a now-former teacher at Harambee Elementary School in Roseville, was outlined in a federal civil rights lawsuit filed by parent Kristen Lindsey in the US District Court in St Paul last week. </p>

<p>Lindsey claims that Cook, who is white, choked her seven-year-old son, who is black and has learning disabilities, and left him so traumatized that he had to transfer out of the school district. </p>

<p>The mother further alleged that the principal of Harambee tried to hide the assault from her for weeks until the boy told her himself. </p>

<p>Her lawsuit asserts that Cook also assaulted two other black students in the 2019-20 school year - and that at one point the teacher forced her son to put his hands behind his back as if he was under arrest.</p>

<p>Geraldine Cook, a teacher at Harambee Elementary School (pictured) in Roseville, Minnesota, has been accused of physically assaulting three black students in her second-grade class and segregating them from their white peers</p>

<p>State records reviewed by the Star Tribune showed that Cook's teaching license, which she first obtained in 1988, is no longer valid.  </p>

<p>A spokesman for Roseville public schools, Joshua Collins, told the outlet that Cook joined the district - which is also named as a defendant in Lindsey's suit - in August 2013 and resigned in December 2019. </p>

<p>Collins declined to comment on the lawsuit allegations against Cook but said: 'The safety and well-being of our students is our most important obligation, and we take any complaint of harm against a student seriously.' </p>

<p>The lawsuit alleges that Harambee Principal Delon Smith (pictured) was aware of Cook's alleged abuse but did nothing to stop it</p>

<p>Lindsey's lawsuit outlines how she came to know Cook while working as a volunteer at Harambee, describing the teacher as 'overwhelmed and erratic', particularly in interactions with black students in her class.  </p>

<p>The mother alleged that Cook once told her she was struggling with 'that particular group of students' as she gestured toward six or so black children who had been forced to sit away from their white classmates. </p>

<p>Lindsey voiced concerns about Cook to Principal Delon Smith after that encounter, but he never did anything in response, the suit claims. </p>

<p>About a month into the 2019 fall semester, Cook allegedly left Lindsey a voicemail in which she complained that her son was speaking to adults in an inappropriate manner, and asked if the boy was allowed to misbehave at home. </p>

<p>When Lindsey met with Cook to address her concerns about the boy, Cook repeated her gripes about black students misbehaving, the suit claims.  </p>

<p>Soon after that, Lindsey claimed her son came home from school with a tear in his shirt. The boy told her that his teacher had ripped it while pulling on his arm. </p>

<p>Days later another black child accused Cook of assaulting him, the suit claims. It quotes that child as saying that his teacher 'doesn't like black kids' and that Cook had pushed, shoved and 'smooshed the faces' of black students in her class.  </p>

<p>Lindsey's lawsuit alleges that at least six of her son's classmates told the Principal Smith that they saw Cook choke him. </p>

<p>When the boy brought the claim himself, Smith allegedly told him not to tell his mother. </p>

<p>Cook allegedly retaliated against the boy and his classmates for going to the principal, at one point marching him to the principal office 'while forcing him to hold his hands behind his back like a criminal defendant', the suit states.  </p>

<p>Lindsey said she started noticing changes in her son's behavior around the time of the alleged assault and had him undergo a psychological evaluation which revealed signs of recent trauma.  </p>

<p>The mother said her son finally told her about the choking incident after informing her that Cook was no longer his teacher.  </p>

<p>The boy's uncle, Ronald Lindsey, brought up the alleged abuse at a Roseville school board meeting about a month before the teacher's resignation (pictured)</p>

<p>The boy's uncle, Ronald Lindsey, brought up the alleged abuse at a Roseville school board meeting about a month before the teacher's resignation. </p>

<p>Video showed the uncle demanding an investigation into the 'assault and/or assaults being inflicted by staff upon minor children and the attempted coverup of these documented facts, not allegations'.</p>

<p>Rachel Lindsey's lawsuit seeks monetary compensation for the violation of her and her son's civil rights. </p>

<p>It alleges that the school district prevented her from providing her son with the care he needed by failing to tell her about the alleged choking incident and other alleged abuses in Cook's classroom.  </p>

<p>One of Lindsey's attorneys, Joshua Newville, told the Star Tribune that 'there has been some pre-litigation discussions with the School District, but not anything I'm prepared to talk about'.</p>

<p>The outlet said Cook did not return its requests for comment on Monday. </p>
