<p>Bold: Larsa Pippen didn't appear in the least bit fazed as she stepped out for dinner at celeb hotspot Madeo in Bevlery Hills on Wednesday night</p>

<p>Larsa - who opted to forgo a face mask - donned the baggy, silky zebra printed number, which featured a fabric belt and zipper down the middle.</p>

<p>She rocked clear heels with white polish and her fingers and toes.</p>

<p>The star rounded out her look with a small black Hermes handbag with gold hardware; her hair was half up, half down and she had a full face of makeup.</p>

<p>In May of this year, Larsa slammed trolls after they criticized her caption that seemingly alluded to her estranged husband, basketball legend Scottie Pippen.</p>

<p>The duo are parents to four children together: sons Scotty Jr, Preston, and Justin, and daughter Sophia.</p>

<p>The criticism started after she posted a snap of herself and captioned it: 'Find someone who'll put you first.'</p>

<p>People commented things like 'To [sic] bad you didn't put Scottie pippen first' and 'that's what scottie did,' according to People.</p>

<p>Larsa replied back to the critics, writing: 'Really? I did everything for him literally everything' as well as 'How do you know that?'</p>

<p>Interesting: In May of this year, Larsa slammed trolls after they criticized her caption that seemingly alluded to her estranged husband, basketball legend Scottie Pippen</p>

<p>When one troll mentioned the rumor that she committed 'adultery first' she wrote a scathing response back: 'Stop tripping dude u don't know what you're talking about. I held him down and still do. Just bc I don't air his dirty laundry doesn't mean it doesn't stink I just don't wanna do his laundry anymore.'</p>

<p>Her clapback came nearly a month after she defended him on Twitter after the Michael Jordan docuseries The Last Dance talked about Scottie's earnings with the Chicago Bulls, revealing it was much less than Jordan's.</p>

<p>'Thx for your concern Scottie did ok #TheLastDance,' adding a screengrab of an article about it.</p>

<p>He made $109,102,430 during his NBA career, People reported. </p>

<p>Larsa and Scottie wed in 1997 but split in October 2016; Scottie filed for divorce from her just two days after two voice recordings were released with Larsa alleging that he was verbally aggressive to her in a call to the police.</p>

<p>Cops made two visits in early October 2016  for domestic disturbances but no further details were ever known.</p>

<p>He asked the divorce to be dismissed in November 2017, suggesting they reconciled - with the duo hitting the carpet together in February 2018.</p>

<p>However, in November 2018 Larsa filed for divorce after 21 years of marriage, after allegedly cheating on him, an allegation she later shut down on Twitter in since-deleted tweets.</p>

<p>Five days ago, Larsa shared a snap of herself with Scottie and three of their children in celebration of their son Preston's birthday - her and Scottie's current relationship status is not known.</p>

<p>Doting mom: She posted a snap with her eldest son as well, Scotty Jr.</p>

<p>Larsa and Kim Kardashian have reportedly unfollowed each other on social media, with Kourtney and Khloe also not following Larsa as well.</p>

<p>Soon after, Larsa unfollowed Kim's sisters.</p>

<p>'The friendship just naturally grew apart over a period of time because life happens. Kim is focused on matters at home - getting Kanye West healthy, her four young kids, law school and juggling her businesses,' E! News' source said.</p>

<p>'They are in a different place in their lives and are not as close as they used to be, but have no ill feelings at all and still stay in touch,' the insider added. </p>
