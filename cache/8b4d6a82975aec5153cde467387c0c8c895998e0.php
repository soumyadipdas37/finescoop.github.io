<p>The League Two club saw their fixture against Leyton Orient, scheduled for Saturday, postponed after the London club returned 17 positive tests, meaning they forfeited their Carabao Cup tie against Tottenham.</p>

<p>With no crowds anticipated at professional games before the spring, clubs in the EFL face a perilous winter in which they will be unable to rely on match day income.</p>

<p>Walsall boss Darrell Clarke has urged Premier League to rescue sides facing a dark future</p>

<p>There have been calls for more regular testing across the competition but without greater financial support, this is likely to prove unrealistic, with a single test often costing more than Â£100.</p>

<p>'There is no money coming in and clubs are on their knees,' said Clarke. 'It's very difficult and you hope that help from further up the pyramid will be forthcoming.</p>

<p>'We need the Premier League to come up trumps after the disastrous news about no fans in grounds and I hope they will. I find it hard to understand - you can go to a pub or get on a plane but you can't sit outdoors in an stadium at a safe distance from others.</p>

<p>'When you look at the cold hard facts, it's remarkable. We have done so much work and spent a lot of money to ensure we could get fans safely back. We were working on the basis of having 3,270 fans in our ground.'</p>
