<p>Vroom vroom: Betty plays race car driver Kira, who has a particularly steamy kiss scene with Euphoria actress Barbie Ferreira</p>

<p>She said of the role: 'And I won’t lie to you, it would be very full circle if I could make a budding, young queer girl feel 1/100th of the way Shane from The L Word made me feel'</p>

<p>She told Pride.com of the role: 'I LOVED it. Kira is definitely way cooler than I am. I wish I could wear that racing suit every day. It’s amazing how playing a bada**, powerful, self-assured woman rubbed off on me a little. </p>

<p>'I’m still not as cool as her but I definitely learned a little something from her that lives in me now. And I won’t lie to you, it would be very full circle if I could make a budding, young queer girl feel 1/100th of the way Shane from The L Word made me feel.'</p>

<p>Largely considered to be a queer icon, she came out on Instagram back in October of 2018, when a fan asked if she felt 'exploitative' pandering to the LGBTQIA community.</p>

<p>Betty responded: 'Not that I should have to justify myself to you or anyone, but I have been in relationships with both men and women. </p>

<p>'I have been deeply, earth shatteringly in love with both men and women. Just because I happen to be engaged to a man doesn’t mean that I haven’t found a home within the gay community.'</p>
