<p>The Frenchman scored his side's first from the spot after originally winning the penalty, set up Angel Di Maria for the second and was a threat throughout as Marquinhos added PSG's third.</p>

<p>It is PSG's second successive win as they look to get their season on track following a chaotic opening. </p>

<p>Kylian Mbappe inspired PSG on his return from quarantine as they defeated Nice 3-0</p>

<p>The Frenchman (R) was in fine form as PSG got their season on track after a disastrous start</p>

<p>With Thomas Tuchel unable to call on talisman Neymar as well as Leandro Paredes for their parts in a mass brawl against Marseille, the manager will have been thankful to welcome back Mbappe after completing his period of quarantine. The Frenchman was at the heart of everything that was good about PSG. </p>

<p>A quiet opening saw Nice force the first save, with former Manchester United and Everton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin forcing a strong parry from Keylor Navas from distance.</p>

<p>The Parisians found their breakthrough from the spot with just over 35 minutes played when Kylian Mbappe was tripped by Khéphren Thuram.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old dusted himself off and fired home the penalty to open his account for the season. </p>

<p>Kylian Mbappe opened the scoring and his account for the season from spot after 35 minutes</p>

<p>The Frenchman scored on his return after being tripped by Khéphren Thuram</p>

<p>The goal certainly livened the game up and moments later though goalkeeper Keylor Navas forced into action to save low down from Rony Lopes after a smart one-two.</p>

<p>Nice's pressure was short lived though as the visitors went 2-0 up in first half stoppage time with Mbappe once again heavily involved. </p>

<p>A typical mazy run and shot by the Frenchman was saved by Nice 'keeper Walter Benitez right into the path of Angel Di Maria who was able to tap home.</p>

<p>Angel Di Maria put the Parisians 2-0 up just before half time after some good work by Mbappe</p>

<p>Thomas Tuchel was thankful to call on Mbappe once again with several players missing</p>

<p>The hosts showed the were very much still in the game at the start of the second half as a delightful ball in from Hassane Kamara was inches away from being converted firstly by Amine Gouiri and then Thuram.</p>

<p>Navas was once again called into action with a wonderful fingertip save to deny Youcef Atal's well-struck effort.</p>

<p>Mauro Icardi, who put in a much more positive showing, nearly scored his first goal of the season as he guided Di Maria's low cross onto the post with Benitez beaten.</p>

<p>Mbappe continued to run Nice ragged as Dante had to deny him his second goal after another tricky run, but it was Marquinhos who all-but secured the points for PSG, heading home from Di Maria's free-kick with just over 20 minutes to play.</p>

<p>In the closing stages, Nice were initially presented with a chance for a consolation from the spot but after originally giving a penalty, Ander Herrera's foul was judged by referee Benoît Bastien to have been committed outside the box and Dante fired over the free kick in the final kick of the game.</p>

<p>Marquinhos headed home PSG's third in the second half from Di Maria's free kick </p>

<p>The Brazlian secured a good win for the visitors as they begin to get their season on track</p>
