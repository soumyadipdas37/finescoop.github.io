<p>This week the Australian-British actress who played Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter movies - Miriam Margolyes - checks-in to our travel Q&amp;A.  </p>

<p>She reveals that she's a nervous flyer, loves islands and more... </p>

<p>How are you coping without travel?</p>

<p>I keep in touch with people in different countries and watch travel programmes, and wish I could take part. It’s a real deprivation not to be able to travel.</p>

<p>Top weekend trip?</p>

<p>I’m very lucky because I’ve got three places to visit which belong to me. My favourite is my house in Tuscany, La Casella, a 300-year-old farmhouse. I’m hoping I can visit in September because it’s glorious at that time.</p>

<p>Are you a good flyer?</p>

<p>I’m always nervous and think that I’m going to die. For many years, I went everywhere by boat. I do fly now though.</p>

<p>Best memory from your latest travel series?</p>

<p>Sitting around the campfire at Seven Emu Station, seeing the Milky Way with total clarity.</p>

<p>Best bit of Australia?</p>

<p>I warm to there being no people. Goolwa in South Australia is glorious. And I’m fond of Adelaide. It’s an elegant, quiet city.</p>

<p>Miriam says that she loves islands and would love to go to Sardinia (pictured) next</p>

<p>Can’t travel without?</p>

<p>A book — and my glasses.</p>

<p>Where do you want to go next?</p>

<p>Sardinia. I love islands. And I’d also like to go back to Tasmania.</p>
