<p>Margot and Tom have been married since 2016, after first meeting in 2013 on set of World War II drama Suite Française in France.</p>

<p>The pair went on to become roommates, with a group of other friends, as they lived together in a property in London.</p>

<p>She said: 'We kept it a secret. Because we weren't really taking it seriously. "Oh, whatever, we're just mates, we're just mates." And then… everyone found out.'</p>

<p>And their reluctance to reveal that they were dating appeared to be for good reason, as the screen star went on to admit that the revelation didn't go down too well.</p>

<p>'It was dramatic,' she recalled of the moment her friends found out. 'I'm not going into the details, but s**t hit the fan.</p>

<p>'Our house turned into The Jerry Springer Show for a moment there. But then the dust settled, and it was all good.'</p>

<p>In February, Margot, who splits time between the US and the UK with Tom – in between all of their other travels – opened up about her hectic life with her beau.</p>

<p>She told The Project host Carrie Bickmore: 'My mom is like, "You have got to leave work at work, so you guys can have time for yourselves."'</p>

<p>She added: 'We don't get as much downtime as we'd probably like, but we both really like what we do!</p>

<p>'We don't have time for chill, but we have a lot of fun and we love what we do.'</p>
