<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jurgen Klopp has once again refused to completely rule out a summer deal for Bayern Munich ace Thiago Alcantara.</p>

<p>The playmaker has been linked with the Reds for the entirety of the summer, after expressing his desire to leave Bayern Munich and embrace a new challenge.</p>

<p>And now, on the eve of the new Premier League season, Klopp has once again been asked about the chances of the Spaniard arriving at Anfield, and whether he could personally put an end to the speculation.</p>

<p>On the eve of the Premier League opener, Jurgen Klopp did not rule out a move for Thiago</p>

<p>The Bayern Munich midfielder has been linked with Anfield for the entirety of the summer</p>

<p>Speaking to reporters in his pre-match press conference ahead of facing Leeds United, Klopp responded: 'If I could invent a word that would end speculation I think I could become really rich. </p>

<p>'I cannot end speculation as long as the transfer window is open so that's all really I can say.'</p>

<p>Sensing that the topic was not about to go away, Klopp broke into a large grin before continuing to talk up the skill set of the midfielder. </p>

<p>Klopp stressed the quality of the player and said it was 'nice' for Liverpool to be linked with him</p>

<p>'Did I mention Thiago Alcantara is a really good player? Long ago already!</p>

<p>'It's nice we are linked with him but that's pretty much all really. It's because he's a good player and Liverpool is big club so that's nice. </p>

<p>'But apart from that really nothing to say about it and unfortunately, or maybe good for you [media], I cannot end the speculations.'</p>

<p>Liverpool have until October 5 to conclude any summer business, after which point the transfer window will officially close.</p>

<p>The Reds have already completed the £11.75m signing of Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos, though are still understood to be in the market for central defensive cover.</p>

<p>Klopp would also not be drawn on the subject of Rhian Brewster's Liverpool future</p>

<p>Young striker Rhian Brewster continues to be linked with a move away from Anfield, either on loan or in a permanent deal.</p>

<p>Addressing this point, Klopp said: 'I can't clear it up because there is nothing to say.</p>

<p>'He's a wonderful kid, big big talents but decisions for the squad and positions for who, they're just not finished yet, we don't know whats going on. </p>

<p>'We are really with him, thoughtful of his development and how we can help him.</p>

<p>'Who is going on loan where, nothing is decided, or they would be there already.'</p>
