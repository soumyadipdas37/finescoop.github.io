<p>Frank Lampard was delighted with Thiago Silva’s impact both on and off the pitch for Chelsea</p>

<p>Afterwards Lampard said: ‘It was a perfect 60 minutes for him tonight. He will show the qualities he has. Of course, he will get fitter and better. </p>

<p>'He also gave us something for me on the night in the dressing room and on the pitch of a leader with authority in terms of his demands on others. </p>

<p>‘He can’t speak the language but at the minute that’s not even a problem because his presence and the way he commands people around him is already showing that to me in training and in our game tonight. </p>

<p>The 36=year-old defender produced an assured display in Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie</p>

<p>‘I am very very pleased with Thiago. It is what I expected of a player of his level but it is very refreshing to have him here at the club.’ </p>

<p>Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud all found the net to add to Kai Havertz's hat-trick, with the £89million Germany playmaker thriving in the number 10 role for his treble.</p>
