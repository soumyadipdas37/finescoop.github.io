<p>World's smallest Rubik's Cube has gone on sale in Japan to mark the 40th anniversary of the original 3D puzzle</p>

<p>Rubik's Cube was invented by Hungarian architecture professor Erno Rubik in the 1970s before a company in the US turned it into a hit product in the 1980s.</p>

<p>More than 100 million cubes were sold worldwide in the first two years.</p>

<p>It was an instant hit in Japan where more than four million were sold in the first eight months after it went on sale in July 1980.</p>

<p>The new tiny cube was shown this week at an exhibition in Tokyo organised by the Hungarian embassy, which also includes an artwork made with Rubik's Cubes. </p>

<p>Norbert Palanovics, the Hungarian ambassador to Japan, said he tells anyone who will listen about the Rubik's Cube because it embodies the small, simple but smart qualities of his country.</p>

<p>'The Rubik's Cube is part of our everyday life here in Japan, too, and inspires everyone,' he said.  </p>
