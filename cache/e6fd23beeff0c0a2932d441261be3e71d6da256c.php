<p>Alongside the gruelling gym workout in a bid to build up muscle, Jones wrote: 'Slowly but surely.'</p>

<p>He had confirmed earlier this month that he was giving up his belt following talks with UFC president Dana White.</p>

<p>Jones, nicknamed 'Bones', has been linked with a match-up against heavyweight champion Stipe Miocic following the call to move up weight class.</p>

<p>Jones said he relinquished his belt as his 'heavyweight goals were going to take some time'</p>

<p>Miocic recently overcame Daniel Cormier while Jones has won 26 out of 28 fights.</p>

<p>On relinquishing the 205lbs crown, Jones wrote on Twitter: 'I vacated the light-heavyweight championship because I knew my heavyweight goals were going to take some time.</p>

<p>'I wasn't going to play games with the contenders and make people fight interim championship belts. There's little rest on the throne.'</p>
