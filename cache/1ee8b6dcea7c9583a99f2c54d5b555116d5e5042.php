<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father heroically protected his young son from being snatched by a conspiracy theorist in a violent drug-induced psychosis.</p>

<p>Michael Paul Rawson, 41, had just stepped out of a taxi from a police station on bail for drug charges as the boy and his father were walking their dog.</p>

<p>As the dad helped his son down from a seat outside Preston Library in Melbourne about 8.30pm on November 25, 2019, Rawson ran over and grabbed the child.</p>

<p>Victorian County Court heard delusions from a cocktail of meth and GHB caused Rawson, a truck driver, to believe the boy was his daughter.</p>

<p>The father, who can't be named, wrestled his son back but was dragged into nearby bushes with Rawson's arm around this neck.</p>

<p>Michael Paul Rawson, 41, was deluded by a cocktail of meth and GHB when he violently tried to wrestle a little boy away from his father as they walked their dog</p>

<p>He was dragged to the ground where he curled up around his son to shield him as the drug-crazed attacker repeatedly punched him in the back of the head. </p>

<p>A passerby ran over to help but was unable to stop Rawson pulling the child away and making a run for it down Gower Street.</p>

<p>The witness gave chase, grabbing him around the waist, and with the help of the boy's father managed to wrestle the child back, along with Rawson's black dressing gown.</p>

<p>Rawson took off and hid in a front garden, where he was cornered by police and charged at them when they tried to arrest him.</p>

<p>The father suffered a cut him and bruises to his eye and the back of his head while his son was traumatised and screaming.</p>

<p>Rawson was taken to Austin Hospital where he tried to escape from his bed while 'screaming and thrashing'.</p>

<p>He grabbed a medical worker's wrist and squeeze and twisted it until he was restrained and strapped to the bed.</p>

<p>Rawson pleaded guilty to attempted kidnapping, assault, causing reckless injury, resisting arrest, and assaulting an emergency officer.</p>

<p>The emotional criminal choked back tears as he made his plea to each individual charge from Ravenhall prison in a video-link hearing on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Rawson pleaded guilty to attempted kidnapping, assault, causing reckless injury, resisting arrest, and assaulting an emergency officer</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Mel Walker said her client was seen about 6.10pm that night 'staring into space' on a nature strip.</p>

<p>Witnesses called police concerned for his welfare saying he 'didn't seem quite right' and officers arrived to find him visibly high on drugs.</p>

<p>He was searched and 2.5g of meth found on him, so they took him to Preston Police Station. He was released on bail soon after changed with drug possession.</p>

<p>The court heard Rawson had a troubled childhood, moving from place to place as his father was a conman constantly ripping people off.</p>

<p>He was bullied at every new school and dropped out early, having a child at just 17 with his partner Christie Vine.</p>

<p>The couple married in 2011 and had five children, one of whom is autistic and the eldest is now 21 and the youngest six years old.</p>

<p>They broke up in 2015 after an argument about housekeeping, after which his 'world came crumbling down',' Ms Walker said.</p>

<p>The court heard Rawson was depressed but instead of getting help self-medicated with meth to 'increase his motivation'.</p>

<p>Rawson delved into conspiracy theories and 'constantly' bombarded Ms Vine with screenshots of anti-vaxxer material linking vaccines to autism.</p>

<p>The attack took place outside the Preston Public Library (pictured) in Melbourne</p>

<p>Ms Vine got a restraining order but he repeatedly breached it by sending her more conspiracy theory material along with calls and text messages.</p>

<p>Rawson put on several community corrections orders but had stayed out of trouble for some time before his arrest last November. </p>

<p>He had not been allowed to see his children for some time before he tried to snatch the boy whom he thought was his daughter.</p>

<p>'His behaviour on the day was extraordinary, unwarranted, unprovoked, and not contemplated for nefarious intention,' Ms Walker said.</p>

<p>'The behaviour and intention did just make sense... he had difficulty coming to terms with what he did.'</p>

<p>Ms Walker argued Rawson's actions were out of character and didn't know mixing GHB and meth would cause the psychosis, making it a mitigating factor.</p>

<p>She said her client would accept a lengthy corrections order following an inevitable jail term, including wearing an ankle monitor and a curfew.</p>

<p>Rawson will be sentenced next Tuesday.  </p>
