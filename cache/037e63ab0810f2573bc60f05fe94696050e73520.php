<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England international Ainsley Maitland-Niles will prioritise regular first-team football as he agonises over his future at boyhood club Arsenal.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old made his senior international debut against Denmark on Tuesday night and now he’s had a taste of England action, the versatile midfielder is eager to remain at the forefront of Gareth Southgate’s plans - particularly with Euro 2020 just nine months away.</p>

<p>But Maitland-Niles knows he has to be playing regularly if he is to remain in the England fold for the forthcoming international matches.</p>

<p>Arsenal's Ainsley Maitland-Niles will prioritise game time as he considers his future at the club</p>

<p>With that in mind, the Arsenal academy graduate is ready to contemplate the heartbreaking decision of leaving north London to enhance his international chances.</p>

<p>Wolves, who have already had a £15million offer for Maitland-Niles rejected, are understood to be preparing an improved bid.</p>

<p>Maitland-Niles has a strong emotional attachment to the Gunners, who he joined as a six-year-old.</p>

<p>The versatile 23-year-old is eager to play regularly to retain his place in the England squad</p>

<p>Wolves, managed by Nuno Espirito Santo, are preparing a new offer for Maitland-Niles </p>

<p>Indeed, the ideal plan for the youngster would be to nail down a regular starting role in Mikel Arteta’s plans and sign a new long-term contract.</p>

<p>But there has been no concrete indications yet that will be the case.</p>

<p>And if that scenario is not forthcoming, then Maitland-Niles is prepared to make the gut-wrenching decision to push for a move elsewhere.</p>

<p>This weekend’s Premier League opener against Fulham could prove pivotal towards how Maitland-Niles views his future.</p>

<p>With Hector Bellerin and Kieran Tierney expected to be available, Arteta has a selection dilemma on his hands as he picks his wing-backs.</p>

<p>And starting Maitland-Niles on the bench is likely to compound the player’s concerns that he will not play as often as he’d like during the new season.</p>
