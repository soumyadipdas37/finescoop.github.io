<p>Cash-strapped English rugby handed major boost after agreeing new O2 sponsorship deal</p>

<p>RFU CEO Bill Sweeney approached the government for a bailout this week after it was announced that crowds may not return for six months.</p>

<p>Premiership clubs have warned they may sink without financial aid, with Sale Sharks owner proposing tax breaks as an additional measure.</p>

<p>'Rugby was already a propped-up business that didn't make much commercial sense – and COVID has made it worse,' Orange told the Mail on Sunday. 'No crowds for six months is a killer blow. Crowds matter to the community game as much as they do to the Premiership.</p>

<p>'As a league, we probably contribute £50millon a year in taxes so it's in the government's long-term interests to not see clubs disappear. We're in survival mode and there's a real danger that could happen.</p>

<p>'The biggest part of a Premiership rugby clubs' cost base is salary. Each club probably has £400,000 a month in PAYE payments to make. If there could be some sort of write off or long-term deferral that would help, as part of a financial support package.'</p>

<p>However, Orange played down the prospect of a further cash injection from financiers CVC in return for more equity.</p>

<p>'Selling off shares at the bottom of the market isn't a good long-term strategy, although nothing is off the table,' said Orange. 'I imagine this has not been a good investment for them, so I can't imagine they're going to want to increase their investment.' </p>
