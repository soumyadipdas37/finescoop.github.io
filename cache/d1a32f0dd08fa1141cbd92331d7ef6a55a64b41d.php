<p>The clip, which was posted by American actress Savannah Meyer, starts with a close-up of a tiled kitchen floor with grubby black stains running along the grouting.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old from Utah then pours a drop of Clorox toilet bowl cleaner onto the tiles, leaves it to soak for five minutes and scrubs it gently with a brush.</p>

<p>Dark discolouration lifts off easily, leaving the strips between each tile sparkling white.</p>

<p>'Should I do my whole kitchen?' Ms Meyer asked in the caption.</p>

<p>American actress Savannah Meyer restored the grimy grouting of her kitchen floor (left) to a sparkling white finish (right) with a drop of Clorox toilet bowl cleaner and a scrubbing brush</p>

<p>And many felt that she should.</p>

<p>'Wow what a difference. I desperately need to do this in my kitchen but there are way too many tiles!' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I just tried this and it worked! Have never done it before, good for a deep clean,' said another.</p>

<p>When one person commented that the hack will 'erode your grout if you keep doing it', Ms Meyer replied: 'You don't do it regularly, it's a one time thing to remove build-up and then you simply maintain.'</p>

<p>Australian viewers urged her to buy special grout cleaner from Bunnings, but Ms Meyer said she was sorry to reveal that the hardware giant does not have any stores in the US.</p>

<p>American actress Savannah Meyer, whose grout cleaning hack has become a viral sensation</p>

<p>Australian viewers urged her to buy special grout cleaner from Bunnings, but Ms Meyer said she was sorry to reveal that the hardware giant does not have any stores in the US</p>

<p>It's the latest cleaning hack to become a viral sensation, following a TikTok clip which details an Australian mother's simple recipe for DIY 'deodoriser' that leaves cupboards smelling fresh and clean without spraying toxic chemicals.</p>

<p>In the video, Melbourne parenting blogger ‘Mama Mila’ pours rice into a glass jar and adds 10 drops of essential oil on top, then covers it with a lid before shaking the contents together.</p>

<p>'Try this one out for your shoe closet,' Mila wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>Replying to comments under the clip, she said the jar should last 'four to six months' depending on the size of the room or closet it's placed in.</p>

<p>Uncooked rice is a natural deodoriser that absorbs smells, flavours and moisture that hang in the air.</p>

<p>Its moisture-absorbing properties also prevent silver from tarnishing, which is why some people keep a small muslin bag of rice at the back of their cutlery drawer.</p>

<p>Mila's video drew delighted responses after it was posted online with comments including 'this is amazing' and 'I will definitely be trying this'. </p>
