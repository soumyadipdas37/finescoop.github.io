<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pope Francis said on Friday that the coronavirus pandemic had 'toppled the shaky pillars' of a world economic model built on the idolatry of money and domination by the rich and powerful.</p>

<p>In a message to participants of the annual European House-Ambrosetti Workshop, which gathers some 200 top managers, economists, and politicians from around the world, he called for new models that would be more inclusive and reduce social inequality.</p>

<p>He also urged 'an ecological retooling' of the economy to save the environment and reduce wasteful consumption.</p>

<p>'It (the pandemic) has called into question the scale of values that sets money and power over all else,' he said.</p>

<p>'It has toppled the shaky pillars that supported a certain model of development,' he said, adding that social and economic uncertainties had made many people open their eyes to inequality and environmental blight.</p>

<p>He said economics should be the expression of a society that 'refuses to sacrifice human dignity to the idols of finance (and) uses financial resources not to dominate but to serve'.</p>

<p>Francis, who has said any eventual COVID-19 vaccine must not be hoarded by rich countries, is believed to be preparing an encyclical letter - the highest form of papal writing - on what he believes the post-pandemic world should look like.</p>

<p>The event, which takes place in the northern lakeside town of Cernobbio each September, is Italy's version of the annual Davos Economic Forum in Switzerland. </p>

<p>This year, it is taking place mostly virtually because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Apart from a host of Italian ministers, participants include French President Emmanuel Macron, 2016 U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and former U.S. national security advisor John Bolton.</p>
