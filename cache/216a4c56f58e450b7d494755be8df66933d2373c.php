<p>Back in 2010, Lorenzen had been reported missing for 10 days before his body was discovered in the woods in Memphis, Tennessee.  </p>

<p>In July 2019, just as trial was finally set to begin, Sherra made a shocking admission to masterminding a plot to kill her ex-husband</p>

<p>The case went cold for nearly a decade with no significant leads until November 9, 2017, when the gun believed to have been used to carry out the killing was pulled from a Mississippi lake. </p>

<p>The following month, Sherra Wright and Billy Turner – a church deacon and small business owner – were arrested and charged with first degree murder.</p>

<p>At a hearing in May 2018, prosecutors laid out the case against the pair with the help of a third unindicted suspect, Lorenzen's cousin Jimmy Martin, who had been convicted of murder in a separate case.</p>

<p>Turner, a landscaper in the Memphis suburb of Collierville, and Sherra Wright attended the same church. Martin recalled how Wright masterminded a plan to kill Lorenzen in Atlanta earlier in 2010 but she failed to execute the plan herself.</p>

<p>She then conspired with Turner to carry out the plot on her behalf in Memphis weeks later.</p>
