<p>She then claims she received an Instagram message threatening to expose the photo.  </p>

<p>The following day, she claims her father received the picture she sent Berger in his work email inbox. </p>

<p>Now, the woman claims she suffers panic attacks that interfere with her 'quality of life'. </p>

<p>She is suing him for causing her 'severe emotional distress', according to court records reviewed by The New York Post. </p>

<p>No details about Berger or his girlfriend have yet emerged and he has not yet responded to the lawsuit.  </p>
