<p>In a new report it said the 27 per cent drop in worldwide car sales in the first half of this year had 'bottomed out' and it expected a sharp rise in 2021. </p>

<p>But it said the severity of the fall would mean that the pace of recovery towards peaks seen before the pandemic – when 95million vehicles a year were sold globally – would be only moderate after that. </p>

<p>Downturn: 'Governments' efforts to support the industry have so far been limited</p>

<p>'The rise in shipments will slow in 2023 and the recovery length, with 2018-19 sales levels unlikely to be recaptured until about 2025,' it said. </p>

<p>'Governments' efforts to support the industry have so far been limited, and we do not expect that to change substantially. </p>

<p>'This is a sharp contrast to numerous programmes to support or bail out automakers during the 2008-9 crisis.' </p>

<p>While car sales peaked at 95million in 2017, by 2019 they had already slipped to 90million. Moody's said: 'The auto industry was already beginning a cyclical downturn before the onset of the coronavirus-induced recession, and companies had started preparing for weaker demand. </p>

<p>'But, as the pandemic spread, factories and dealerships closed and sales collapsed more quickly than carmakers could have prepared for – falling by about 40 per cent during the second quarter. </p>
