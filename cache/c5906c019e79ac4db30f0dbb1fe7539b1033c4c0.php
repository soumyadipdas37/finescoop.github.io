<p>He explained: 'I do regret that, I left Elton John hanging when I was winning an award for playing Elton John.</p>

<p>'But you know what? You aren't in your right kind of mind in that moment, I also made the great faux pas of forgetting to thank the HFPA [Hollywood Foreign Press Association] who vote on the Golden Globes.</p>

<p>'You're just not thinking straight and I haven't had a lot of practice at winning awards so I didn't nail it.'</p>

<p>Taron stressed that Elton wasn't bothered by the incident, and added that 'the rest of the awards show we were holding hands.'</p>
