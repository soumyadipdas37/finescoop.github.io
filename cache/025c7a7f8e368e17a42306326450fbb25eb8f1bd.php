<p>The 18-year-old creative midfielder has followed in the footsteps of his father Paolo and grandfather Cesare by representing Milan and demonstrating his exciting potential. </p>

<p>Daniel - who is the youngest son of former Milan captain and current club director Paolo - scored their second goal with a right footed finish into the far top corner.  </p>

<p>Daniel Maldini scored his first senior goal for AC Milan during their 4-1 win over Monza</p>

<p>The youngster demonstrated his change in pace after linking up with Lucas Paqueta to run through on goal and curl it past Eugenio Lamanna in the 40th minute. </p>

<p>Speaking of Daniel's potential at the club, his father Paolo has said: 'He has already played two matches in Serie A, the excitement is gone. Now it's up to him to consolidate his position within the first team and try to find space.' </p>

<p>Daniel made his debut for the club back in February by coming off the bench in Milan's 1-1 draw against Hellas Verona.</p>

<p>Daniel's father, Paolo, was two years his junior when he made his first appearance in a 1-1 draw away to Udinese in January 1985.   </p>

<p>The 18-year-old followed in the footsteps of father and current club director Paolo Maldini</p>

<p>While his grandfather, Cesare Maldini, also played for Milan &amp; lifted the European Cup in 1963</p>

<p>Paolo went on to represent the club on 901 occasions, scoring 33 goals and winning 24 trophies before hanging up his boots in June 2009. </p>

<p>Known for being one of the best defender of the 1990s, Paolo had two trademarks: one was an unshakeable commitment to fair play. The other was a supernatural ability to slide tackle a winger with clinical precision, before springing back to his feet and running off with ball. </p>

<p>Paolo only ever represented Milan, despite an attempted swoop from Juventus and later Chelsea. </p>

<p>Sir Alex Ferguson even confessed to asking Paolo's father, Cesare, to lure him to Old Trafford. </p>

<p>The Milan superstar retired in 2009 after winning 7 league titles, 5 European Cups and Champions Leagues during his 902 appearances in all competitions.  </p>

<p>While, Paolo's father Cesare represented the Rossoneri as both a player and a coach, and was the first Milan captain to lift the European Cup in 1963.    </p>
