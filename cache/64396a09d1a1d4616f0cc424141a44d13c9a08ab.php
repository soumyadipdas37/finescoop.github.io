<p>When asked about his career, and what makes him say 'yes' to certain projects, Goldblum admits he's been 'lucky' for catching the acting bug.</p>

<p>'I know when I was a kid I was possessed by some kind of seed of passion or crazy inflammation of some kind that made me write on my steamy shower door when I was in high school every day 'Please, God, I want to be an actor,' and then I would erase it because it had to be a secret,' Goldblum said.</p>
