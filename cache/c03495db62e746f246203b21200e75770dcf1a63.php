<p>Anne Lentakis had purchased the punnet of Berry Indulgence from a Foodland in Stirling, Adelaide Hills, on Thursday. </p>

<p>Ms Lentakis told ABC Radio she and her 11-year-old son had been cutting the fruit for an afternoon snack when they came across the contaminated strawberry.</p>

<p>'He cut one strawberry and found a pin deep inside the strawberry,' she said.</p>

<p>'He said to me, 'Mum, I think there's a pin in my strawberry'.'</p>

<p>The distraught mother said her eight-year-old son later found another needle planted in a different strawberry.</p>

<p>A popular supermarket has pulled strawberries from its shelves after a customer found a needle in the fruit</p>

<p>Anne Lentakis had purchased the punnet of Berry Indulgence from a Foodland in Stirling, Adelaide Hills, on Thursday</p>

<p>Ms Lentakis has since notified the fruit and vegetable store of the find and it has pulled the Berry Indulgence brand from its shelves. </p>

<p>'I think there have been things put in place since this happened before with metal scanning, so that was a bit confusing to wonder how and why this could happen but [he was] very appreciative that I had called him,' she said.</p>

<p>'He had jumped on the phone and activated their procedures.'</p>

<p>South Australia police are reportedly investigating the incident.</p>

<p>The harrowing find comes after several needles and thumbtacks were found in groceries at South Australian supermarkets in June and July.</p>

<p>A metal needle was found in a punnet of strawberries and avocado and a thumbtack discovered in a loaf of bread after three different customers purchased the groceries from a Woolworths at Golden Grove, in north-Adelaide.</p>

<p>Woolworths provided police with CCTV footage and also launched their own investigation.</p>

<p>Ms Lentakis told ABC Radio she and her 11-year-old son had been cutting the fruit for an afternoon snack when they came across the contaminated strawberry</p>

<p>The distraught mother said her eight-year-old son later found another needle planted in a different strawberry</p>

<p>'We've also commenced our own investigation with the assistance of our suppliers, in line with our established food safety procedures,' a supermarket spokesperson said at the time.</p>

<p>Another customer also discovered a thumbtack planted in a strawberry after she purchased the fruit from a Foodland supermarket at Goolwa, south of Adelaide.  </p>

<p>A national health crisis was sparked in September 2018 when sewing needles were discovered inside strawberries on sale at major supermarkets.</p>

<p>The contamination scare saw supermarkets pull punnets from their shelves and farmers dump the fruit by the truckload. </p>

<p>Some consumers were reluctant to purchase strawberries and the decline in demand had a significant impact on producers.</p>

<p>The estimated farm gate value of Queensland strawberries had declined by 8 per cent for 2018 to 2019, worth around $12million.  </p>
