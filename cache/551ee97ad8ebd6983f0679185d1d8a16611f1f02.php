<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump has chipped away at Joe Biden's lead in the classically red state of Texas, new polling shows. </p>

<p>A Dallas Morning News poll that was released Sunday shows that Biden's 5-point lead in the Lone Star State is now a 2-point deficit among likely voters. </p>

<p>Among that group, 48 per cent support Trump, while 46 per cent back Biden, with a margin of error of plus-or-minus 3.22 per cent.  </p>

<p>President Donald Trump is now ahead of Democrat Joe Biden among likely voters in Texas, after Biden had a 5-point lead in July. Now Trump is beating Biden by 2 points, which is within the survey's margin of error </p>

<p>Among registered Texas voters, Biden (pictured) is ahead by 1 point, which is also within the poll's margin of error. A Democrat hasn't won the state of Texas since Jimmy Carter won over President Gerald Ford in 1976</p>

<p>When the broader group of registered voters is looked at, Biden remains ahead. </p>

<p>Forty-four per cent of registered voters back the Democrat, while 43 per cent support Trump, with those numbers within the poll's 2.87 per cent margin of error. </p>

<p>Like California is for Democrats, Texas is a must-win state for a Republican presidential candidate in order to secure enough Electoral College votes. </p>

<p>Texas, however, has gotten bluer in recent years, with Rep. Beto O'Rourke, a popular Democrat, getting within 2.6 points of ousting Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018.  </p>

<p>And Trump didn't do as well in Texas as previous Republican nominees. </p>

<p>In 2016, he won by 9 points, but that was still the worst showing of any GOP candidate on the Texas ballot since 1976, when President Gerald Ford lost the Lone Star state to Democrat Jimmy Carter.  </p>

<p>Additionally, Democrats haven't won statewide since 1994. </p>

<p>In April, Biden and Trump were tied in Texas in a previous Dallas Morning News-University of Texas at Tyler survey. </p>

<p>And by early July, Biden had pulled away from Trump, 48 per cent to 43 per cent among likely voters. </p>

<p>Currently, Trump's job approval in the state stands at only 40 per cent, including 53 per cent among his fellow Republicans - a factor that could explain the unexpected tightness in the race.  </p>

<p>Trump and his campaign officials have mocked Biden and the Democrats making a play for Texas, suggesting it would be a huge waste of money. </p>

<p>'I don't think Biden's ultimately going to spend $6 million in Texas,' senior campaign adviser Jason Miller told reporters last week on a press call. 'I think it would be great if he did. I'd welcome him to do it. Texas TV stations would love to have it.'   </p>
