<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British man was killed by a hit-and-run driver who knocked him off his motorbike in Thailand last night. </p>

<p>The 43-year-old Briton was hit by a truck as he drove back from a meal with friends in the city of Nakhon Ratchasima, police said. </p>

<p>Rescuers found him lying face down with no pulse in a pool of blood, and attempts to revive him with CPR proved fruitless, according to the Bangkok Post. </p>

<p>The truck driver is thought to have fled the scene but police are hoping to track them down with surveillance cameras. </p>

<p>The Phon Lan gate (file photo) in the Thai city of Nakhon Ratchasima, close to where a British national was killed in a hit-and-run on Wednesday night </p>

<p>The crash occurred at an intersection near the Phon Lan gate, part of an old city wall in Nakhon Ratchasima in north-east Thailand. </p>

<p>The 43-year-old Briton had been eating with friends not far from the scene of the crash before police were called to the accident late at night. </p>

<p>Authorities have not yet released his name while they go about informing the dead man's relatives. </p>

<p>It is not known whether the man was a British expat, but tourists are currently barred from the country because of coronavirus. </p>

<p>In normal times, British nationals make more than a million visits to Thailand every year, according to the UK Foreign Office. </p>

<p>However, the borders were closed in March as the pandemic escalated around the world.  </p>

<p>Quarantine rules were tightened in July after two imported cases forced more than 400 people to self-isolate in Thailand. </p>

<p>Thailand yesterday reached 100 days without a locally transmitted case of the virus, a stretch which only New Zealand and Vietnam have previously managed.   </p>
