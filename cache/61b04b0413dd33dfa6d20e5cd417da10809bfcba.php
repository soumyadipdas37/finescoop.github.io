<p>The 37-year-old, who performed Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart, said she is a Masked Singer fangirl. </p>

<p>She told host Osher Gunsberg: 'Oh! I was such a fan of the show. I did not miss one episode last year. </p>

<p>Off with her head! The crowd chanted ahead of the big reveal as the mask came off </p>

<p>There she is! It was none other than actress, singer and stage performer, Lucy Durack (pictured) best known for starring in the musical Wicked</p>

<p>She knew it! Dannii Minogue (pictured) guessed it right, and was absolutely delighted to realise she yet again had the correct pick</p>

<p>She added: 'When you're behind the mask, it's so much fun 'cause you've kind of got this freedom to just have a go. </p>

<p>'I got to sing so many songs that I never would've thought I would've had a go at. I'm normally singing, you know, all musical theatre'. </p>

<p>Lucy said she was keeping her appearance on the show a secret from her five-year-old daughter Polly and could not wait to tell her what she's been up to.  </p>

<p>Loves it! The 37-year-old, who performed Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse of the Heart, said she is a Masked Singer fangirl. She told host Osher Gunsberg, 'Oh! I was such a fan of the show. I did not miss one episode last year!' </p>

<p>'I can't wait for my daughter, Polly, to see that it's me. Polly! Um, this is where I've been when I've been going to work!' </p>

<p>Explaining why one of her clues was a golf club, Lucy joked that she didn't spend much time golfing - it was a reference to one of her musical theatre performances.  </p>

<p>Lucy joked: 'Look, I'm not a secret golfer, but you'll notice that the club is a wood and I played Elle Woods in Legally Blonde the musical!' </p>

<p>The Masked Singer continues Tuesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten </p>
