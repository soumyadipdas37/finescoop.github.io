<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bacterial infection causing elephants to suffer 'extremely sudden deaths' has killed another 12 of the animals in Zimbabwe - taking the total death toll from the outbreak to 34.</p>

<p>'A total of 34 carcasses have been found... but some others have not been located,' Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority director Fulton Upenyu Mangwanya told parliament.</p>

<p>The animals died between August 24 and September 23 this year in and around the wildlife-rich forests between the famous northwestern Hwange National Park and the town of Victoria Falls.</p>

<p>'They were found lying on their bellies' suggesting they had an 'extremely sudden death,' Mangwanya said. </p>

<p>A dead elephant is seen in Hwange National park, Zimbabwe on 29 August, 2020. Wildlife authorities said today that a further twelve more elephants have died in Zimbabwe, raising the death toll from a suspected bacterial infection to 34</p>

<p>Tests conducted in Zimbabwe so far point to a disease called haemorrhagic septicaemia, which is caused by bacterial infection, he said.</p>

<p>Rangers have ruled out cyanide poisoning or poaching because the animals were found with their tusks intact.</p>

<p>Mangwanya said wild animals are more susceptible to disease during the country's dry and hot season, which is roughly from August to November. </p>

<p>In recent years Zimbabwe has suffered through successive droughts made more severe by global warming, leaving animals with less water and vegetation. </p>

<p>Wildlife vets take samples from dead elephants found in Hwange National park, Zimbabwe, Saturday, 29 August, 2020</p>

<p>Samples have been sent to a laboratory in Britain and others will be dispatched to South Africa and the United States for further tests and analysis.</p>

<p>Zimbabwe counts more than 84,000 elephants -- almost double the southern African country's ecological carrying capacity of between 45,000 and 50,000.</p>

<p>Neighbouring Botswana, home to the world's largest elephant population of around 130,000, lost around 330 elephants early this year from cyanobacteria poisoning.</p>
