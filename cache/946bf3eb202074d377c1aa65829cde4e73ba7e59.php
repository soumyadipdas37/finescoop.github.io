<p>Honest: Gino D'Acampo, 44, has told that his wife Jessica is not 'jealous' of him being 'surrounded by women' and said if he wanted to be 'unfaithful' he would 'do it anyway'</p>

<p>Speaking to Weekend magazine, Gino said: 'When I met my wife I realised she was an extremely generous, clever woman. </p>

<p>'My friends' girlfriends stopped them doing things, but from day one Jessica gave me a lot of freedom.</p>

<p>'If you try to cage men it won't work. I can do pretty much what I want. If I say, "I'm taking friends out" she doesn't say, "But you've been away for the past week". There's no point having a man around if he doesn't want to be there.' </p>

<p>Couple: Gino said his marriage to Jessica Stellina Morriso, who he met aged 18, works on a 'matter of trust' and he was given 'a lot of freedom' from 'day one'</p>

<p>The This Morning star continued: 'I employ more than 700 women in my restaurants. In TV, I'm surrounded by women. I love it. Women are more interesting than men, but my wife loves it too.</p>

<p>'She doesn't get jealous. She understands that if you want to be unfaithful, you'll do it anyway. It's a matter of trust.' </p>

<p>And Gino revealed that he is understanding of Jessica's decisions, explaining: 'If she wants to have dinner with an ex-boyfriend, I couldn't care less. </p>

<p>'I want her to be happy. If that makes her happy that evening, I'm doing my job.'</p>

<p>Gino has been with Jessica, who is half-English, half-Italian, for 25 years, after the pair met while working in Sylvester Stallone’s restaurant in Marbella, Spain.</p>
