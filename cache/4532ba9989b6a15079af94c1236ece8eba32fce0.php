<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A college has come under fire from angered parents after it issued warnings to students for wearing skirts that were too short- even though they were the largest size available.</p>

<p>Parents slammed Cowes Enterprise College on the Isle of Wight after it penalised pupils falling foul of the school's uniform policy.     </p>

<p>The parents of at least two students said they were sent text messages from the school about their child's skirt being short but argued there was no option to choose a different length skirt that fit the correct waist size.   </p>

<p>One mother, whose daughter is in Year 10, said that the price of the kilt-style skirts, which range between £34.95 and £40.95, has also caused a problem and the only alternative were 'regulation trousers'. </p>

<p>One parent took fire at Cowes Enterprise College on the Isle of Wight after her child was issued with a warning for wearing a skirt that was 'too short' despite wearing the largest size available </p>

<p>The parent explained that her daughter was tall and they had purchased the largest size available</p>

<p>The parent said: 'I like the uniforms, they look smart, but the price and absolute necessity the school places on young children and parents is beyond shameful.</p>

<p>'I was sent a text about my daughter's skirt being too short. We have no spare money and bought her uniform on my overdraft.</p>

<p>'I'm disgusted that during a pandemic, at a time when everyone is skint and emotions are high, uniform is still such a high priority and worth penalising people over.</p>

<p>'My daughter has the largest size skirt, worn correctly. She is tall and wide, the skirt is not.</p>

<p>'Last year we tried trousers and she was placed in isolation because they were too tight. They aren't allowed elasticated waists either, it has to be button and zip.' </p>

<p>Another parent said her daughter had the opposite problem, as she was of slim build and any longer skirts would 'swamp her'. </p>

<p>She went on to describe how her daughter was given a detention due to her kilt being too short.</p>

<p>The mother explained: 'She came home after the first day back with a detention due to her kilt being too short.</p>

<p>The parent received a message from the school telling them their child's kilt skirt was 'too short'</p>

<p>The college said it was not imposing sanctions but giving parents time to address any issues with their child's uniform</p>

<p>'They only come in one length size, and I don't think it looks too short, it's just above her knee. It's not fair that just because she's tall she gets in trouble for it.</p>

<p>'If I got the bigger waist size it would swamp her as she's very slim, but around 5ft 8ins tall.'</p>

<p>Cowes Enterprise College is a mixed secondary school and sixth form for children aged 11 to 19 with academy status.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the academy said the college was not imposing sanctions but giving parents time to address any issues. </p>

<p>They said: 'We have not imposed any sanctions on students who do not have the right uniform, instead providing support to parents and giving them time to address any issues.</p>

<p>'We have also provided financial support where parents can demonstrate they are in need.</p>

<p>'It is only where students have been flouting the rules, such as rolling up skirts to make them shorter, where we have given detentions.</p>

<p>'It is not correct that the right lengths and sizes of skirt are not being sold. Girls are also allowed to wear trousers if they prefer.'</p>
