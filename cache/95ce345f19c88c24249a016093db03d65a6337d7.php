<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She announced her split from TV chef Phil Vickery in January after 20 years together. </p>

<p>But it seems as though all is not well between them in 62-year-old Fern Britton's latest social media activity is anything to go by. </p>

<p>On Wednesday, she retweeted a post about 'betrayal, falling out and being used' and wrote that the words 'fit so perfectly.' </p>

<p>'You get betrayed by people you never thought': Fern Britton has shared a cryptic Twitter post eight months after announcing split from husband of 20 years Phil Vickery on Wednesday (pictured in 2009) </p>

<p>The post in full: Fern wrote: 'Whoever wrote this KNOWS ! Xx'</p>

<p>It read: 'In life, you will fall out with people that you never thought you would. Get betrayed by people that you trusted with all your heart. </p>

<p>'And get used by people you would do anything for. But life also has a beautiful side to it. </p>

<p>It continued: 'You will get loved by someone you never thought you would have. Form friendships with people that will establish more meaningful and stronger relationships. </p>

<p>Fern then wrote: 'This fits so perfectly' as she shared the post once more </p>

<p>'And overcome things you never thought you would get over. </p>

<p>'We all have chapters that end with people at some point in life. But take pride in knowing that the very best part of your book is being written.' </p>

<p>She then added: 'Whoever wrote this KNOWS ! Xx.' </p>

<p>Back in June, Fern spoke about her marriage to Phil, 59, breaking down on ITV's Lorraine and said: 'Unfortunately, we fell apart!'  </p>

<p>The TV personality explained that she was trying to finish her book while everything in her personal life was going on, and confessed that she 'needed the rest' which was forced on her by lockdown.  </p>

<p>Fern explained: 'Unfortunately, Phil and I fell apart. And I had this book to write this book and get it out on the deadline.</p>

<p>Still friends: The television presenter and chef announced in their split statement 'we will always share a great friendship and our lovely children' back in January (pictured in 2007)</p>

<p>Announcement: The couple shared matching statements on their Twitter pages to announce the end of their marriage as they thanked fans for their 'kindness and support'  </p>

<p>'And once all that was done, lockdown happened and it's like three months of - I needed that rest, you know?' </p>

<p>Fern and Phil share 18-year-old daughter Winnie, whilst the Ready Steady Cook presenter also has twins Harry and Jack, 26, and Grace, 23, with former husband Clive Jones. </p>

<p>Fern spoke about learning to be single during the coronavirus lockdown. </p>

<p>She said: 'We separated at the beginning of the year and fortunately it's all smooth. We just came to the end of the road, you know, which is sad. </p>

<p>'So, I've been adjusting to life as just me to think about, and my two daughters happen to be here because they got stuck in lockdown, happily for me.</p>

<p>'It's a time for me to really adjust my existence, which on the one hand is really quite exciting, but you've also got to process it for a while.'  </p>

<p>The TV host also reflected on their former relationship in an interview with Weekend Magazine: 'We had a wonderful time. We were the best of friends. And I miss that friendship.' </p>

<p>'There comes a point when the children are substantially off your hands and you look at each other and wonder where you're going to go from here.' </p>

<p>'I don't want anyone. I can do it by myself. I don't feel lonely. I like my own company. I realised not long ago that I was married, on and off, for 33 years.'   </p>

<p>On Twitter in January, both Fern and Phil wrote matching statements which read: 'After more than 20 happy years together, [we] have decided to go our separate ways. We will always share a great friendship and our lovely children.</p>

<p>'We would appreciate it if our privacy is respected at this time. Thank you for your continued kindness and support. [sic]'</p>

<p>The couple tied the knot 20 years ago in 2000, after Fern had split from Clive in the same year following a 12-year marriage.  </p>

<p>The couple met on This Morning when Fern hosted the show alongside Philip Schofield - who now hosts with Holly Willoughby - and the star previously said she never thought she would find love again as a mother of three children.  </p>

<p>Honest: In June, Fern appeared on Lorraine where and spoke about the breakdown of her marriage to Phil </p>
