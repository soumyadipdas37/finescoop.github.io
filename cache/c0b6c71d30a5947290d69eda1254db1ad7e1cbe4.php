<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Yannick Bolasie has admitted there were 'no excuses' for his embarrassing open-goal miss for Everton in their pre-season friendly win over Preston on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Toffees winger was given the ball in the six-yard box with the goal gaping but somehow managed to kick the ball behind him. </p>

<p>Bolasie saw the funny side after the match as he posted on Twitter with an embarrassed Homer Simpson GIF saying: 'No excuses....I have no idea #lostmyhead.' </p>

<p>But thankfully for Bolasie, Carlo Ancelotti's side ran out 2-0 winners at Goodison Park. </p>

<p>And Everton's new £21million signing Allan was in attendance as he watched on from the stands.  </p>

<p>The Brazilian watched Jonjoe Kenny score his first senior Everton goal as he buried the ball into the net after seven minutes.</p>

<p>Bernard flourished in a central role, surging upfield with the ball at his feet and supplying a number of incisive passes.</p>

<p>Everton's new £21million signing Allan was in attendance as he watched on from the stands</p>

<p>The Brazilian watched Jonjoe Kenny (centre) score his first senior Everton goal on Saturday</p>

<p>Indeed, it was Bernard skipping forward and funnelling the ball to Richarlison which opened up Preston for Everton's second goal on 65 minutes, as Dominic Calvert-Lewin steamed in to force home from the left-wing cross. </p>

<p>The lone downside for Everton arrived with an injury for Mason Holgate, who hobbled off 14 minutes before half-time after hurting himself stretching to tackle in his own half.</p>

<p>Holgate was replaced by Kyle John, joining fellow Academy products Anthony Gordon, fresh from signing a new five-year deal with the Club, and goalkeeper Harry Tyrer on the pitch.</p>

<p>The Toffees face Tottenham in London in their first Premier League game of the 2020-21 season on September 13.</p>
