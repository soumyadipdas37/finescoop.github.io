<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Texas teacher was fired earlier this month for wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask during in-person workdays over the summer amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Lillian White, an art teacher at Great Hearts Western Hills, a public charter school in San Antonio, was fired on September 5 for refusing to stop wearing the mask after school officials asked her to stop. </p>

<p>The words 'Black Lives Matter' are written on one side of the mask while the other side reads, 'Silence is Violence'.</p>

<p>White, who said she started wearing the mask to show her support for black students and faculty, told CNN that no students were on campus during the in-person workdays over the summer.  </p>

<p>The words 'Black Lives Matter' are written on one side of the mask while the other side reads, 'Silence is Violence'</p>

<p>She said that her first warning came two weeks after she began wearing the mask. </p>

<p>'Hey. can you start bringing a different mask on campus? We don't discuss the current political climate on campus. Parents will start coming around more now,' Heather Molder, the school's assistant headmaster, wrote in a text message to White, according to CNN. </p>

<p>White, who has been an educator for 10 years said that she 'immediately' knew it was time to make a decision. </p>

<p>'This is a human rights issue and I did it for my students who experience racial injustice in school. I refused to back down,' White told CNN. </p>

<p>'If you're scared about what parents are going to say because a teacher is supporting equal rights, you need to reevaluate the kind of people you're catering to. By staying silent, Great Hearts is only supporting racist parents.'  </p>

<p>White spent a month speaking to officials about the matter, but she was fired on September 5 just days before students returned to campus.</p>

<p>She says she was told that her termination was a result of her refusing to wear a different mask.</p>

<p>In a statement, Great Hearts Texas Superintendent Daniel Scoggin explained that the school's policy forbids faculty from displaying messages on their face masks. </p>

<p>The policy was enacted amid two pandemics plaguing the US: racism and COVID-19.</p>

<p>'We stand with the Black community and all who are suffering. Great Hearts deplores bigotry and its crushing effects on all those subjected to it,' Scoggin told CNN. </p>

<p>'Great Hearts is committed to an America where racism, violence, and injustice do not happen, because such acts find no home in the hearts of a great people,' he added.</p>

<p>Following her termination, White started a Change.org petition that demands Great Hearts 'implement an anti-racism action plan'.</p>

<p>The petition has been signed by more than 2,700 people as of Sunday morning.  </p>
