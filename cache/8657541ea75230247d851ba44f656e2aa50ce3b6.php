<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nuno Espirito Santo is waiting for the OK from his agent to sign a new contract after dropping a strong hint he will stay at Wolves for the long term.</p>

<p>The Portuguese manager said: ‘In terms of the contract I don’t have to worry about anything because it’s not my job. I don’t negotiate contracts, I just wait for an email to say “go ahead”.</p>

<p>‘This is the situation, it’s not an issue for me or the coaches. All the hours of our day are basically the same, working to improve the team.’</p>

<p>Nuno Espirito Santo is waiting for the OK from his agent to sign a new contract with Wolves</p>

<p>The 46-year-old is expected to sign a three-year contract with a significant pay rise from his current £3million deal. </p>

<p>Assistant head coach Rui Silva, first-team coach Julio Figueroa, his assistant Joao Lapa, goalkeeping coach Rui Barbosa and fitness coach Antonio Dias are likely to follow suit.</p>

<p>After the last game of their 383-day season, Nuno gave the board a clear message new players were needed.</p>

<p>Since then, forward Fabio Silva, 18, has joined for £35m, defender Marcal for £2m and midfielder Vitinha on loan. Wolves want to add at least one more player this month.</p>
