<p>The mother-of-five sang into the mic: 'I'm broken, picking up the pieces baby. Heartbroken, can you put me together again?</p>

<p>Heartache: The reality star, 42, released footage online of her practicing the new song which is based on her relationship woes and will be featured on her upcoming album</p>

<p>Katie has suffered multiple heartbreaks including her divorces from Peter Andre in 2009, Alex Reid in 2012, and Kieran Hayler in 2020. </p>

<p>And the former glamour model revealed that the song was written by music producers about her romance struggles before she entered The Priory in January this year to address her cocaine and alcohol use. </p>

<p>Music producer Rick said: 'This song is called Heartbroken or Broken and it's more for people out there that have broken, come out of a relationship, [are] feeling terrible and are just trying to pick themselves back up.</p>

<p>Inspiration: Her music producer Rick Live revealed the song is for listeners suffering from heartbreak and said: 'That's what Katie's done numerous times and that's what it's about really'</p>

<p>'That's what Katie's done numerous times and that's what it's about really. This is a track for her album that's going to be about her whole life.'</p>

<p>Katie criticised her own vocal abilities and described dealing with the studio team's brutal honesty. </p>

<p>She said: 'We all know I'm not the best singer in the world and I do like to hear myself sing out of tune, because that's how we learn!</p>

<p>''Cause I am like an amateur singer, I'm not professional- although I would love to be and I want to be- I take their guidance. I know when I'm out of tune. </p>

<p>'They are brutal with me and I would rather they be brutal [because] I am a quick leaner, once I've got it I've got it. </p>

<p>Critic: Katie criticised her vocal abilities and said: 'We all know I'm not the best singer in the world and I do like to hear myself sing out of tune, because that's how we learn!'</p>

<p>'What's good is they don't pussyfoot around, you're in the studio to work and if I'm not doing the vocal right, they tell me I'm not doing it right.' </p>

<p>Katie is reportedly dedicating all the songs on her new album to her boyfriend, 31, and the couple are considering a duet.</p>

<p>A source close to the reality star told The Sun that she has signed up for vocal training in preparation for a music tour. </p>

<p>They explained: 'When the time comes and she's able to tour she will deliver those tunes and really prove her doubters wrong.</p>
