<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich discussed the possibility of bringing Mario Gotze back to the club after being released by Borussia Dortmund, but decided against a move it has been revealed.</p>

<p>Gotze is a free agent after announcing his decision to leave Signal Iduna Park at the end of last season, but has not yet found a new club.</p>

<p>And according to Bild, that could have been the Bundesliga champions, who are looking to add depth to their squad with the pending transfer of Thiago Alcantara to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich had considered bringing Mario Gotze back to the club as a free agent </p>

<p>However, despite holding talks within the club, chiefs decided against any move - with the player unaware of those developments.</p>

<p>Despite no offer from Bayern forthcoming, Gotze insists that he does not have to make the move away from the Bundesliga.  </p>

<p>'The Bundesliga also belongs to Europe and I never said that I had to leave the Bundesliga,' he told Bild. </p>

<p>'There are several ambitious clubs in Germany.'</p>

<p>Gotze originally left Borussia Dortmund in 2013 to join rivals Bayern and stayed for three years</p>

<p>However, there is one desire that could shape the World Cup winner's next move, with the 28-year-old desperate to lift the Champions League. </p>

<p>'I have ambitious goals and I really want to win the Champions League,'  he added.</p>

<p>'That drives me every day, in every way. I don't want to end my career without having won this title once.'</p>
