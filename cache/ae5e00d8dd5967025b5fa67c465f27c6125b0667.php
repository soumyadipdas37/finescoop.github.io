<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who glued up her own vagina and tried to frame her ex for the crime, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison.</p>

<p>Vanesa Gesto accused former boyfriend Ivan Rico of kidnapping her outside her home and abandoning her semi-naked after squeezing the superglue into her private parts.</p>

<p>Her story began to unravel when investigators uncovered CCTV footage showing Gesto buying the glue and a 'kidnap kit' including knives she used to harm herself from a Chinese-run supermarket.</p>

<p>Police also discovered the only vehicle filmed passing the spot where she claimed to have been assaulted and then tortured was a council bin lorry - not the black car she said she had been abducted in.</p>

<p>Rico, 36, spent several days on remand in prison before the shameful attempts by Gesto, dubbed the 'Glue Liar' in their native Spain, became apparent.</p>

<p>Yesterday it emerged a court in the northern Spanish city of Leon had convicted her of two counts of making up a crime and jailed her for 10 years.</p>

<p>She was also ordered to pay her ex €25,000 (£20,200) in compensation in a written sentence released this week after a trial earlier this year at Leon's Provincial Court.</p>

<p>State prosecutors had demanded an 11-year, eight-month prison sentence.</p>

<p>Gesto's original lawyer Emilia Esteban cut ties with her former client after it emerged she had tried to frame Ivan over the made-up October 2016 crime, said to have happened in the town of Bembimbre - an hour's drive west of Leon.</p>

<p>Ivan's brother Rafael, who said from day one his sibling was sleeping when the supposed glue attack and kidnap took place, said: 'Our mum spent days crying after he was arrested.'</p>

<p>Lawyer Mrs Esteban said: 'I always believed Vanesa and that's why I defended her. I feel humiliated and deceived.' </p>
