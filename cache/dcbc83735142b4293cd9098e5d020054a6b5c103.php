<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A record number of Australian universities have been ranked among the best 200 in the world.  </p>

<p>The Times Higher Education Rankings 2021 list included 12 Australian institutes, with nine of those improving their positions from the previous year.</p>

<p>Top of the list was the University of Melbourne, coming in at 31st, followed by the University of Sydney at joint 51st. </p>

<p>The top of the list for Australia was the  University of Melbourne, (pictured) coming in at 31st</p>

<p>The Australian National University was ranked 59th, followed by the University of Queensland at 62, Monash University at 64 and the University of New South Wales at 67. </p>

<p>The University of Technology Sydney showed the most improvement, jumping a total 34 places to joint 160th.</p>

<p>The global list included more than 1,500 universities across 93 countries and regions, making them the largest and most diverse university rankings to date. </p>

<p>This was followed closely by the University of Sydney (pictured) at joint 51st </p>

<p>But educators fear the strong rankings could be short-lived as COVID-19 spells disaster for the country's tertiary education sector.</p>

<p>Times Higher Education chief knowledge officer Phil Baty said Australia's rankings may dwindle if border closures continue to impact international student numbers.</p>

<p>'But what we can reasonably assume is this is very vulnerable success [because] it is dependent on international students,' Mr Baty the Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>While the University of Technology Sydney showed the most improvement, jumping a total 34 places to joint-160th</p>

<p>'The most significant thing will be losing income if there's a longer term reduction in international students. That funding pays for superstar researchers, doing quality research and driving up rankings.'</p>

<p>But he said Australia's handling of the pandemic could position it better for attracting international students than the United States or the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>'Australia and New Zealand have come out quite well despite the recent upsurge – perceptions of safety might advantage [them],' he said.</p>

<p>The University of Oxford retained the number one ranking for the fifth year in a row.</p>
