<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A paedophile has been jailed after impregnating a 13-year-old girl he met on a dating app before offering to adopt her.</p>

<p>Matthew James McIntyre, 35, met his young victim through teenage dating app MyLOL in Adelaide in January 2020.</p>

<p>He later claimed that he used the app to communicated with his adult partner, despite them both living in the same house.</p>

<p>McIntyre said he initially thought the girl was 17 but messages showed he was aware of her real age after she spoke about school and buying a new school uniform.  </p>

<p>Their relationship came to light when a youth worker from the residential care facility found explicit text messages sent between the pair. </p>

<p>One of the messages showed that the father-of-two had picked up his victim from the facility on January 9 and returned her in the afternoon after they had unprotected sex.</p>

<p>Text messages sent after their meeting showed the victim was trying to end her relationship with McIntyre, The Advertiser reported.</p>

<p>'You, on the other hand, persistently expressed a desire to meet up with her for sexual intercourse, even saying you wished to get her pregnant,' Judge Julie McIntyre said.</p>

<p>'At one point, somewhat oddly, you expressed a wish to adopt her and introduce her to your girlfriend and daughter.'</p>

<p>Judge McIntyre said the victim was vulnerable and suffering from personal issues including the terminal illness of her father.</p>

<p>She said McIntyre showed predatory behaviour. </p>

<p>'Even when your victim told you she feared she was pregnant and would have to have an abortion because she was unable to cope with a baby you suggested she ought to keep the child and continue to have unprotected sex with you,' Judge McIntyre said.</p>

<p>The pair's relationship was reported to police, which led to the teenager taking a pregnancy test that turned in a positive result.</p>

<p>The 13-year-old later aborted the pregnancy.</p>

<p>The pair met on teenage dating site MyLOL (pictured), which McIntyre claimed he used to communicate with his partner</p>

<p>McIntyre pleaded guilty to one count of communicating with a child for a prurient purpose with the intention of making a child amenable to sexual activity and one count of unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under the age of 14.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to three years and nine months behind bars with a non-parole period of one year and eleven months.</p>

<p>Despite his early guilty plea, Judge McIntyre refused to grant a 40 per cent discount to McIntyre's sentence.</p>

<p>McIntyre will be eligible for parole in July 2022.</p>
