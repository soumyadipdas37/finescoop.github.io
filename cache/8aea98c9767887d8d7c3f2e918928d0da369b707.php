<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She was Strawberry Fields in Quantum of Solace, but Gemma Arterton has admitted she would not pick a similar role for herself anymore. </p>

<p>The actress, 34, from Kent, who had her big break when she was 21 with the Bond movie starring Daniel Craig in 2008, said her character didn't have much to do in the movie. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Telegraph, Gemma, who has started her own production company, Rebel Park, which aims to involve women in all aspects of film making, said: 'I know I wouldn’t choose a role like that now. Because she was funny and she was sweet, but she didn’t really have anything to do – or a backstory.' </p>

<p>Despite that, Gemma says she's still grateful to Quantum's producer Barbara Broccoli and for the doors the Bond franchise has since opened for her.</p>

<p>In the 2008 movie, Strawberry Fields was an intelligence operative working at the British Consulate in Bolivia, charged with sending Bond back to London. </p>

<p>She was the second Bond Girl in the movie after Olga Kurylenko's Camille Montes and became a romantic interest for Bond shortly after being introduced. </p>

<p>Speaking of how her career has evolved since her Bond days, Gemma says she now feels more confident - and would happily challenge any uncomfortable on-set requests. </p>

<p>She gave the specific example of unplanned intimate scenes that may not have been in a script. </p>

<p>'You’re thinking: “Hang on, that’s not in the script, and you haven’t even spoken to me about that”,’ she told the publication. </p>

<p>‘And at that point you’re in front of all the crew and under pressure, when you should have dialogue way before that where you get asked: “Are you cool with this”,' she went on. </p>

<p>She admits she doesn't mind if she seems 'a bit difficult' now that she has an established career, whereas a younger version of herself wouldn't have wanted to 'challenge' it.  </p>

<p>Gemma went on to say she didn't experience sexism until she started working in the movie industry - adding that she's been 'a bit naive.' </p>

<p>Gemma also admits that as a young actress she struggled to stand up for herself in the way she would in her personal life. </p>

<p>However, she says co-founding Rebel Park has changed her outlook on the movie industry as she gets to work with so many talented women. </p>

<p>She says it helped her discovered another way of thinking and motivated her to work with all female or gender-split filming crews. </p>

<p>Gemma's recent movie Summerland, which is now showing in cinemas, was filmed with a totally 50-50 crew, which she says was 'really hard to achieve,' but could be done. </p>

<p>In Matthew Vaughn'd upcoming movie The King's Man, a World Wat I prequel to his very successful Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kingsman: The Golden Circle, Gemma plays a gun wielding Nanny Polly, which she described as a 'matriarch' and 'everybody's rock.'</p>
