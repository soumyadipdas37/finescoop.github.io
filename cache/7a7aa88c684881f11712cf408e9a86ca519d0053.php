<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anthony Joshua has been sent a stern warning from Kubrat Pulev's promoters - telling him he will face legal repercussions if he tries to sidestep their fight to take on Tyson Fury. </p>

<p>The world champion is eager to lock horns with the Gypsy King in what would be an all-British undisputed title fight and one of the biggest fights in boxing history. </p>

<p>First Joshua must face his IBF mandatory challenger Pulev, although it has been reported that the Watford-born star could skip past the fight and go straight into a mega bout with Fury. </p>

<p>Anthony Joshua has been warned not to sidestep his mandatory bout with Kubrat Pulev </p>

<p>The British star is seeking an undisputed mega bout against heavyweight rival Tyson Fury </p>

<p>But Pulev's promoter said skipping his challenge against Pulev would be met with legal action</p>

<p>Both Joshua and Fury have already agreed a deal to share a ring next year, and promoter Eddie Hearn said his fighter would be willing to take on Fury in December if his scheduled clash with Deontay Wilder falls through. </p>

<p>But Pulev's representative Ivaylo Gotzev insisted that trying to bypass Pulev would be a bad idea and urged them to 'do the right thing' and 'respect the rules of the IBF'.</p>

<p>'That's something that they have always contemplated at their end,' the promoter told Press Box PR. 'But that door will be closed with a lawsuit if they break our deal and our contract.</p>

<p>Ivaylo Gotzev said there was a 'signed agreement' and told Matchroom to 'do the right thing'</p>

<p>'There are some very good attorneys in England and some very fair courts, so it will come down to whether they want to decide whether they want that or not.</p>

<p>'I do believe AJ and his promoter will do the right thing and do as they say and finalise the deal.</p>

<p>'Through blood sweat and tears Kubrat earned his position to challenge AJ. Will they overrule his rights, can they all overrule his rights? That's entirely up to them if they want to try that.</p>

<p>'They should respect the rules of the IBF. There's a signed agreement.'</p>

<p>Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn said suggested taking on Fury in December was a possibility</p>

<p>Gotzev claimed both sides were still in the process of adjusting the original contract for the fight, which was delayed from April due to the coronavirus and is yet to receive a new date or venue. </p>

<p>'We are in the final stages of closing the deal, which we are extremely happy with,' he added. 'We're adjusting the original contract and it's finally going in the right direction that keeps both sides happy.</p>

<p>'It's now up to Eddie to conclude their part. Our signature will come a lot easier than theirs.'</p>

<p>Pulev will be a huge underdog going into the fight against the IBF, WBO, WBA and IBO champion, but Gotzev believes his client is seeking a stoppage win and compared him to Rocky Balboa - calling Joshua a 'mama's boy'. </p>

<p>Gotzev said Pulev was like Rocky Balboa and that the Bulgarian is seeking a knockout win </p>

<p>'To become a champion you must go into foreign lands and conquer and that's what Kubrat has decided to do. That's where the win will be the sweetest and the most legitimate. Let's do it in London.</p>

<p>'We're going for the knockout. Kubrat is a man's man. He has heart, skill. talent and he's going to upset the apple cart. The question is: is AJ a man or is he still a mama's boy?</p>

<p>'Kubrat is the big underdog, it's like a Rocky story. AJ is a physical specimen, he's like Apollo Creed and we're bringing in Rocky. When he upsets AJ that's the end of Matchroom's reign.'</p>
