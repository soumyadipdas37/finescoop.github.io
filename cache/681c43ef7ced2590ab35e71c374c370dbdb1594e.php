<p>Inder and Gurkirat Sarao arrived in Australia as international students from Punjab in 2014 before settling in north Melbourne. </p>

<p>The couple used extra time at home through coronavirus lockdown sanctions to their advantage to make money and launch a growing career through social media.</p>

<p>'I quickly adapted to this new work-style of working from home. Not only did it help me save on traveling time, but it also gave me an opportunity to focus on YouTube as an additional source of income,' Mrs Sarao told SBS.</p>

<p>Posting videos became a much-needed source of income for the couple, as Mr Sarao was unable to find work in the highly competitive Melbourne taxi market.</p>

<p>'I tried my luck both with taxi and Uber, but it turned out to be a big challenge,' Mr Sarao said.</p>
