<p>Young people studying at the University of Leeds descended on the city centre in their droves and socialised in numbers greater than Boris Johnson's Rule of Six - without a care in the world.</p>

<p>Onlookers watched freshers openly flouted all Government measures to halt the spread of coronavirus, including basic social distancing, and formed huge queues to get into pubs and clubs.</p>

<p>Flirty new undergraduates dressed to impress their peers ahead of the university's official induction week from September 21 as more than 500,000 students head back to campuses this autumn. </p>

<p>Thousands of freshers are due to start university over the course of this month and into the start of October despite official warnings that having sex with other students will help to spread the virus. </p>

<p>University authorities are under huge pressure to make their campuses Covid-secure. Measures published by the Department for Education (DfE) include making face masks compulsory in classes, having students living in halls of residence self-isolate in their own 'households' and ban gatherings which defy the Rule of Six. </p>
