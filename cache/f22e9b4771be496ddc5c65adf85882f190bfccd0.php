<p>'The biggest thing that has ever happened to me!' Dance Moms alum JoJo Siwa celebrated scoring a spot on TIME's list of 100 Most Influential People on Tuesday</p>

<p>'It's no wonder my seven-year-old daughter North and millions of other children around the world adore her. When North met JoJo last year to fulfill her dream of being part of her YouTube channel, North got really shy. But JoJo, like a big sister, made her feel at home as they dressed up, danced and made slime.'</p>

<p>Kim noted how when her E! reality series premiered in 2007, she was old enough to know who she was and make her own decisions.</p>

<p>'I can't imagine what it's like to live this life at age 17. JoJo embraces it, and I hope she always will,' Kardashian wrote.</p>

<p>'At some point, she'll evolve and grow up a little bit, and that's okay. The people who love and support her will always be there.'  </p>
