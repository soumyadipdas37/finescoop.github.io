<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Adventurous Australians are being warned not to fall for an 'unbelievably realistic' paddleboard scam, where the popular equipment is being offered for just $90.</p>

<p>ROC SUP Co. provides Aussies with high-quality, lightweight, inflatable paddle boards with prices starting at $600.</p>

<p>So when one keen online shopper saw a Facebook advert for up to 80 per cent off, she told Daily Mail Australia it felt like a no-brainer.</p>

<p>Usually careful with buying online, the shopper checked the slick website carefully, and saw it had a normal URL and thousands of positive customer reviews.</p>

<p>It was only after she had made a payment and received a 'dodgy looking confirmation email' that she realised it was all a scam.</p>

<p>'I've never fallen for a scam before, but this website was unbelievably realistic,' the scam victim told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'It's so slick, they've just copied the real company's website - even the URL looked legitimate.'</p>

<p>The 29-year-old lost $200 after ordering two boards online, only to realise her money was gone and she'll never be receiving the equipment. </p>

<p>'It just shows how easy it is to fall for these things,' she said.</p>

<p>'I realised straight after putting my card details in that I didn't get a proper payment confirmation, and an email they've sent looks dodgy.'</p>

<p>'God knows if I'll ever get my money back.'</p>

<p>The internet is littered with similar stories, as victims urged others not to buy from the scam site. </p>

<p>So when one keen online shopper saw a Facebook advert (pictured) for up to 80 per cent off, she told Daily Mail Australia it felt like a no-brainer</p>

<p>When comparing the real ROC SUP Co. website against the fake one, they look almost identical, copying every word on every page as well as pictures.</p>

<p>The fake website even has the same orange scam alert sitting at the top of the page and has an almost exact replica of the logo.</p>

<p>'Recently we have been getting reports of fraudulent advertisements being run on Facebook, Instagram, and other social media channels for our products,' the scam alert reads. </p>

<p>'They are NOT legitimate or associated with us in any way!'</p>

<p>'We are incredibly disappointed to see that this is happening and we are working diligently to get them taken down. You can find our authentic boards here on our website or on Amazon but any other outlet is not authorized.'</p>

<p>The real ROC SUP Co. has asked for customers to flag the fake advertisements when seen on social media and reporting the purchase to payment providers for a chargeback.</p>

<p>But the scam alert is also on the fake website, easily fooling customers into believing it is legitimate.  </p>

<p>An Australian Competition and Consumer Commission spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia Scamwatch had not yet received any reports about the website. </p>

<p>A CBA spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the security of customers' banking details is a top priority.</p>

<p>'We invest in state of the art fraud prevention and detection technology and have a dedicated team who actively monitor unusual or suspicious activity,' she said.</p>

<p>'Another way we try to keep ahead of the curve is working closely with law enforcement agencies and other banks to share information and understand potential threats.'</p>

<p>While CBA understands scams and illegal activity may still occur, customers have a 100 per cent guarantee against online fraud where they are not at fault.</p>

<p>'Where there is fraudulent activity, our process is to fully reimburse our customers as quickly as possible to minimise inconvenience,' the spokeswoman said. </p>

<p>'If a customer notices an unusual transaction on their account, they should contact us on 13 2221 immediately to report it.'</p>

<p>The ACCC suggests all consumers to be careful of online shopping sites requesting unusual payment. </p>

<p>The Scamwatch Australia website says that $4,120,843 has been lost just this year to online shopping scams. </p>

<p>There have been a total of 8,160 reports, with $499,792 lost directly from social media scams.  </p>

<p>'Scammers use the latest technology to set up fake retailer websites that look like genuine online retail stores,' the ACCC website reads.</p>

<p>'They may use sophisticated designs and layouts, possibly stolen logos, and even a '.com.au' domain name and stolen Australian Business Number.'</p>

<p>The biggest tip-off is usually the method of payment - with scammers asking to pay using a money order, pre-loaded money card or wire transfer.</p>

<p>'If you send your money this way, it's unlikely you will see it again or receive your purchased item,' it says. </p>
