<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Developers are exploiting planning laws to convert empty shops, banks and barbers into tiny high street flats.</p>

<p>The new developments have sparked concerns that UK high streets are turning into modern slums. </p>

<p>The impact of the coronavirus on high-street businesses have resulted in a rush to transform them into residences under permitted development rights (PDRs).</p>

<p>Chloe Gray, a 20-year-old resident of one of the flats, said it felt like 'living in a pod'. Converted flats on Shirley Road pictured above</p>

<p>PDRs were until recently mainly used to convert office spaces but are now being used to transform former businesses into small flats. </p>

<p>Since 2013, they have allowed developers to skip the requirement to apply for planning permission when turning office blocks into flats.  </p>

<p>They were extended to shops and launderettes in 2016, before also including fast food outlets last year. </p>

<p>PDR flats are not bound by the minimum space standard, which says studios have to be at least 398 square feet, or 37 square metres. </p>

<p>In Southampton, the Open Fire Centre, a store which sold electric and gas fires, has been converted into six studio flats, the smallest measuring just 160 square feet.</p>

<p>In five out of six of the flats on Shirley Road, the only external light comes from a sidelight next to the door. </p>

<p>Chloe Gray, a 20-year-old resident of one of the flats, said it felt like 'living in a pod'. </p>

<p>'I have been here for about a year now but I will be moving out in October as it is just too small,' she told the Sunday Times. </p>

<p>She pays £525 per month in rent, which works out at about £33 a square metre.</p>

<p>Robert Webb, 43, who runs a barber next door to the flats, told the publication: 'The flats are tiny. </p>

<p>'I have a friend who lives not far away in the New Forest, and the kennel for his two dogs is bigger than these flats next door.' </p>

<p>Tom Copley, London's deputy mayor for housing and residential development, said of the new developments: 'The solution to the housing crisis is not to create new slums out of old offices and shops, but the delivery of high-quality, well-planned, affordable homes. </p>

<p>'If lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic should teach us anything about housing, it is the importance of minimum space standards, both internal and external.' </p>
