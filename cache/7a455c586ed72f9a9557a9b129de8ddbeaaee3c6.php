<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>UFC superstar Conor McGregor and coach John Kavanagh have formed one of the most formidable partnerships in the sport's history.</p>

<p>But years before McGregor started winning titles, he was humbled by his coach during one of their very first training sessions.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Irish Independent, Kavanagh relayed his rage when McGregor dropped now-retired Irish women's strawweight Aisling Daly during a sparring session back in 2007.</p>

<p>John Kavanagh revealed the explosive incident in one of his first sessions with Conor McGregor</p>

<p>The UFC superstar knocked Aisling Daly who went on to fight in the Strawweight division</p>

<p>Kavanagh said: 'It sounds worse than it was. He wasn't hitting her in the head or anything, but just happened to throw a body shot that hit her in the sweet spot, the solar plexus, and put her down.</p>

<p>'I got a little emotional because Ais had been with me a long time and the other guys would look after her.</p>

<p>'But this new guy had come in and put her down, and my protective nature kicked in.</p>

<p>'I was still fighting at that stage, or hadn't stopped that long, so I put the gloves on - actually, he has corrected me on that and says it was bare knuckles.</p>

<p>'But I held him down and beat the s**t out of him, without putting too fine a point on it.</p>

<p>'I kept hitting him in the body until he couldn't breathe and then I looked at him: 'What's it going to be? We can train or we can fight?' And he was OK from the next day.'</p>

<p>The pair have since gone on to become one of the most successful fighter-coach partnerships in mixed-martial arts.</p>

<p>McGregor returned to the Octagon in January, easily beating Donald Cerrone via TKO as he returned to winning ways following a defeat to Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018.</p>

<p>The Irishman retired from the sport back in June, though he has retired twice before, leading many to believe his decision would not be permanent.</p>

<p>Dana White has confirmed McGregor won't fight in 2020, though McGregor has hinted that he may be ready for a comeback against rival Nate Diaz. </p>
