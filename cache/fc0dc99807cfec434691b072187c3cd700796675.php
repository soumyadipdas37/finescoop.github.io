<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>US stock markets, as well as those in the UK, closed up firmly in the red yesterday, and analysts on all sides will be watching closely to see how the coming day pans out.</p>

<p>The FTSE 100 got out on the wrong side of bed this morning, down around 0.89 per cent or 52.12 points to 5,798.74, after closing at 5,850 last night.</p>

<p>On the topic of US stocks, David Madden, an analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: 'Recently, the NADSAQ 100 has powered ahead as big name companies like Apple, Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla have been in extremely high demand.</p>

<p>'There has been talk of gross overvaluations for some time, and yesterday there was a big sell-off in the stocks. </p>

<p>'Panic selling set in and equities across the board suffered as a result. In the end, the NASDAQ 100 finished down more than 5%, and the S&amp;P 500 lost 3.5%.'</p>

<p>In UK company news today, four major housebuilders, namely Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey face action from the Competition and Markets Authority.</p>

<p>Buyers have argued that they were caught in a leasehold trap, with rising ground rents and unfair fees.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, embattled coffee chain Pret a Manger has launched a new subscription service to help boost sales. It will offer customers up to five coffees a day if they sign up to a monthly subscription service.</p>

<p>Pret A Manger has launched an in-store subscription service for customers to pay for the coffee they order each month as part of a major shift in the company’s model after being hit by dwindling commuter numbers.</p>

<p>The coffee and sandwich shop chain axed 2,800 roles last week after reporting that sales had been significantly hit by low footfall in city centres following the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>It said is now launching the YourPret Barista service which will allow customers to buy up to five drinks each day for a month on a £20 monthly subscription.</p>

<p>The offer – which could add up to 150 drinks a month – will cover all barista-made coffees as well as teas, hot chocolates, smoothies and frappe drinks.</p>

<p>It said the subscription, which will officially launch on Tuesday 8 September, will be free to subscribers for the first month.</p>

<p>Mark Hayward, chief executive of NAEA Propertymark, said: 'It’s promising to see the CMA is taking enforcement action against four house builders on the grounds of mis-selling and unfair contract terms in relation to leasehold homes.</p>

<p>'The NAEA Propertymark Leasehold: A Life Sentence? report revealed three in five (62 per cent) leasehold property owners felt they were mis-sold and a further 93 per cent wouldn’t buy another leasehold property. </p>

<p>'This means that for too long house builders and developers have not been transparent enough about what it means to buy a leasehold property, leaving many in financial difficulty as they have become trapped in confusing contracts with their freeholder.'</p>

<p>Four of the country’s biggest housebuilders could risk court action if they do not commit to changing the way they do business, after the competition watchdog found evidence they had mistreated leasehold buyers.</p>

<p>The Competition and Markets Authority said that it has written to Barratt Developments, Countryside Properties, Persimmon Homes and Taylor Wimpey after uncovering 'troubling evidence of potentially unfair terms'.</p>

<p>The regulator said that buyers may have been misled by developers, and been trapped into leaseholds with ground rents that double every decade.</p>

<p>'It is unacceptable for housing developers to mislead or take advantage of homebuyers. That’s why we’ve launched today’s enforcement action,' said CMA boss Andrea Coscelli.</p>

<p>A freeholder owns both the house and the land it is on, while a leaseholder basically rents the property for a fixed period – sometimes centuries.</p>

<p>The watchdog said it was taking action over the mis-selling of leaseholds. It said that developers had not clearly explained what ground rent is and whether it increases over time to some buyers.</p>

<p>Following in the wake of US and Asian markets, the FTSE 100 is struggling this morning, falling nearly 1 per cent earlier. But, at the moment, the blue-chip index is down 0.2 per cent or 11.71 points to 5839.15.</p>

<p>The FTSE 250 index is currently down 5.73 points to 17,453.96.</p>
