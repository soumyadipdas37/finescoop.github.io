<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fulham are hoping to beat Tottenham to the signing of Inter Milan centre back Milan Skriniar in a stunning deal that would smash their all-time transfer record.</p>

<p>Scott Parker's side have struggled at the start of their Premier League return and have conceded at least three goals in all of their opening three top-flight matches.</p>

<p>A centre back is top of their wishlist as they bid to avoid instant relegation back to the second tier, and reports claim that they have now entered the race for Skriniar.</p>

<p>Inter Milan's Milan Skriniar has emerged as a surprise target for Fulham in the summer window</p>

<p>The Sun report that Fulham are hoping to beat their London rivals Tottenham to the signing, with Spurs willing to offer between £30million and £35m for the defender.</p>

<p>Milan, though, are said to want around £45m if they are to sell to one of the Premier League clubs before the window closes.</p>

<p>If Fulham do manage to secure a deal upwards of £30m, it will smash through their all-time transfer record which currently stands at £27m for Jean Michael Seri ahead of their previous return to the top flight.</p>

<p>Club owner Tony Khan took to Twitter to apologise for the club's most recent performance</p>

<p>Parker hit back at Khan's tweets and said it wasn't helpful to apologise to fans on team's behalf</p>

<p>Fulham's problems on the pitch moved off it this week after boss Parker took umbrage with tweets sent by owner Tony Khan. </p>

<p>He took to social media to apologise to fans for the team's display, and opened up on the club's attempts to secure a new defensive signing this summer.</p>

<p>Parker, in his press conference just hours later, labelled the tweets as 'not helpful' and insisted it is 'not something I agree with'.</p>

<p>On top of the huge transfer fee to sign Skriniar, it is expected the Slovakian defender would also command huge wages, another hurdle for the Premier League new boys to overcome. </p>

<p>Fulham have struggled defensively and risk being relegated straight back to the second tier</p>
