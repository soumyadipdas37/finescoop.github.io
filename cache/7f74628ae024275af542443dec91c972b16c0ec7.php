<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parishioners have voted to remove a memorial stone commemorating a slave trader from their church following complaints from anti-racism campaigners.</p>

<p>The controversial 5ft tall plaque inside St Peter's Church in Dorchester, Dorset, praises the 'bravery' and 'humanity' of 18th century plantation owner John Gordon, who suppressed a slave rebellion in Jamaica - which saw almost 500 killed.</p>

<p>The church's 15 committee members have now voted for it to be moved to a museum following objections from Black Lives Matter groups, who said it 'glorified' racism.</p>

<p>Other options considered were for it to be left in place with accompanying material giving its historical context or moved to a less prominent spot in the church.</p>

<p>The parishioners' decision will need to be ratified by the church following a 'consultation' process before the plaque can be taken down.</p>

<p>The controversial 5ft tall plaque inside St Peter's Church in Dorchester, Dorset, praises the 'bravery' and 'humanity' of 18th century plantation owner John Gordon</p>

<p>The church's 15 committee members have now voted for it to be moved to a museum following objections from Black Lives Matter groups, who said it 'glorified' racism</p>

<p>Church warden Val Potter (pictured) said: 'We were already in conversation with the Dorset County Museum about the possibility of them taking it and displaying it in a setting which could do justice to the full story'</p>

<p>They have asked for temporary plaque cover to be made in the meantime.</p>

<p>John Gordon was born in Sutherland, Scotland, in 1728.</p>

<p>He was a lawyer for the Ellis family in the 1750s and, jointly with another attorney, took over administration of the Greencastle and Newry Plantations in Jamaica which produced sugar, rum and molasses.</p>

<p>He used that position to establish his own business as a plantation owner, possibly buying or leasing land from John Ellis.</p>

<p>In 1760 slaves staged a rebellion over their ill-treatment, leading to one of the most brutal suppressions of its time.</p>

<p>Gordon returned to Britain and died in Dorchester in October 1774, aged 46.</p>

<p>The plaque in his honour is on the wall opposite the south door entrance to the 15th century church and is quite prominent, with a carved urn on top and the family coat of arms below.</p>

<p>The plaque reads: 'He was signally instrumental in quelling a dangerous rebellion in that island (Jamaica), in the year of 1760.</p>

<p>'A large body of n*****s whom his bravery had repulsed, finally yielding to their confidence in his humanity.'</p>

<p>Accounts from the time suggest the aftermath was anything but humane.</p>

<p>Some rebels were killed on the spot while others were taken prisoner and then executed in gruesome ways.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Church warden Val Potter said: 'At the Parochial Church Council meeting, the members were presented with three options.</p>

<p>'These were to leave the memorial in place with accompanying material and possibly cover the offensive word, to move it to a less conspicuous place in the church or to move it to the museum.</p>

<p>'There was the opportunity to contribute to the discussion and everyone who spoke considered the third option the most appropriate.</p>

<p>'The decision must now go through all the legal processes of the church equivalent of the planning process.</p>

<p>'The officers are known to be sympathetic to the decision and hope to make the process as smooth as possible but it must give the opportunity for a wide range of consultation.</p>

<p>'We were already in conversation with the Dorset County Museum about the possibility of them taking it and displaying it in a setting which could do justice to the full story.'</p>

<p>The church have had complaints about the plaque before but the recent Black Lives Matter campaign 'pushed it up the priority list'.</p>

<p>Mrs Potter said earlier this year: 'We are very grateful to the Black Lives Matter campaign for raising the urgency of the issue, we've been thinking about what to do about it for some time.</p>

<p>'The only negative comments we get in our visitors box are about this memorial. The movement has pushed it up the priority list.</p>

<p>'We welcome people's strong opinions and are grateful to people making their protest verbally, the last thing we want is anybody taking physical action against it.</p>

<p>'Everyone is saying this is a horrendous side of our history but it's a story we need to acknowledge and tell.'</p>

<p>Stand Up to Racism Dorset also complained about the plaque saying it glorified racism and should not be on display there.</p>

<p>They 'congratulated' the church for its decision to take it down.</p>

<p>David Rhodes, of Stand Up To Racism Dorset, said: 'We congratulate the church council for this decision, and especially the efforts of the church warden in steering a course through the church decision-making process.</p>

<p>Mrs Potter said earlier this year: 'We are very grateful to the Black Lives Matter campaign for raising the urgency of the issue, we've been thinking about what to do about it for some time'</p>

<p>Mrs Potter said: 'The only negative comments we get in our visitors box are about this memorial. The movement has pushed it up the priority list'</p>

<p>'We believe that the council has made the right decision. It is good that the church is taking steps to acknowledge our 'shameful past'.</p>

<p>'The Gordon Plaque commends and celebrates the actions of John Gordon in suppressing a rebellion by enslaved people fighting for their freedom in Jamaica in 1760.</p>

<p>'It is a celebration of white supremacy and racism.'</p>

<p>The church has connections with author Thomas Hardy who helped redefine the eastern end of the building when he worked as an architect in the town.</p>

<p>There is also a statue of writer and poet William Barnes outside the building as he was also the parish vicar.</p>
