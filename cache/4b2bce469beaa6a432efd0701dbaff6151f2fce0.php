<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A knifeman has been given a suspended sentence after brandishing two huge kitchen knives at Gatwick Airport.</p>

<p>Adam Russell, 32, told a neighbour he had planned a 'massacre' at the airport and wanted 'to kill them all'.</p>

<p>Russell, who suffers from schizophrenia, was in the midst of a relapse in his mental illness when he took a bus to Gatwick in the early hours of June 3, 2019.</p>

<p>He was armed with two 10-inch blades, a court heard, and nearly 200 people were evacuated from in the South Terminal as Russell headed towards the international departure lounge.</p>

<p>Armed police arrived two minutes after security staff pressed the panic button and officers tasered Russell before arresting him. </p>

<p>Adam Russell (pictured with two large kitchen knives), 32, told a neighbour he had planned a 'massacre' at Gatwick Airport and wanted 'to kill them all'</p>

<p>Russell, from Crawley in West Sussex, pleaded guilty to possessing a bladed article and affray. He appeared at Lewes Crown Court for sentencing on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Rachel Beckett said Russell was seen by one of his neighbours about 1.30am while they both waited for a bus.</p>

<p>She told the court: 'The defendant said he was going for a massacre at Gatwick.</p>

<p>'He later said he was going to kill them all.'</p>

<p>Russell arrived at the airport and was seen walking into the arrivals hall, carrying a knife in each hand.</p>

<p>One witness said the defendant was 'walking with purpose in his stride' and had 'an emotionless glazed over look in his face'.</p>

<p>Russell (pictured), who suffers from schizophrenia, was in the midst of a relapse in his mental illness when he took a bus to Gatwick in the early hours of June 3, 2019</p>

<p>Another said Russell looked 'like he was on a mission'.</p>

<p>As onlookers realised the danger they started shouting and running, with security staff ushering people away.</p>

<p>Russell was heard shouting 'come on then' as he continued to hold the knives.</p>

<p>The prosecutor added: '(A) security officer said she was so scared when she saw the defendant she was scared he was about to start stabbing everyone.</p>

<p>'She thought "this is it, this is a terrorist attack".'</p>

<p>Staff pressed the panic button at 1.54am and armed police arrived in the area at 1.55am.</p>

<p>Officers armed with a carbine and handguns found the defendant and shouted at him to show them his hands.</p>

<p>Armed officers tasered Russell before arresting him after he walked through Gatwick Airport's security area with two large knives</p>

<p>They formed the view that he was 'aggressive and an immediate danger' and tasered him in the chest.</p>

<p>After he was apprehended, he told officers that he suffered from schizophrenia.</p>

<p>The court heard that a week before the Gatwick incident he had told ambulance staff that voices in his head were telling him to blow up the airport.</p>

<p>Defence barrister Fiona Clegg said: 'What is very clear is that in the proceeding weeks to the incident that his mental health was deteriorating significantly.</p>

<p>'Mr Russell now wishes me to indicate that he is now able to see - whilst he was not at the time - just how alarming this must have been.</p>

<p>'It was not his intention to harm anyone there.'</p>

<p>She said that Mr Russell is 'profusely sorry' and has been engaging with mental health services.</p>

<p>Callum Oldfield, 21, said he briefly spoke to the man at a bus stop in Ifield, West Sussex, and asked what he had in his bag</p>

<p>Sentencing him, Judge Jeremy Gold QC said it was a 'very serious' incident and that in other circumstances he would be sending him to prison for an extended time.</p>

<p>He told Russell: 'You were not thinking logically or reasonably at the time.</p>

<p>'You had told a neighbour that you were going for a massacre at Gatwick Airport and you were apprehended by the police at the airport after they tasered you.</p>

<p>'Those officers would have had other possibilities open to them including the use of firearms.</p>

<p>'In many respects you are fortunate to be standing in front of me today.</p>

<p>'They could have dealt with the situation very differently.'</p>

<p>He said he was 'unimpressed' that Russell had been self-medicating with illicit drugs at the time of the incident.</p>

<p>During the attempted attack last year a 39-year-old woman was picking up her family's bags with her husband and two children after returning from a week in Tenerife when they heard the call to evacuate and ran towards departures.  </p>

<p>She told MailOnline: 'We heard from baggage handlers that someone was “airside” and then staff confirmed that once he’d got through staff security he was heading towards a door which led straight to baggage reclaim.' </p>

<p>The woman, who asked not to be named, said staff told passengers that their lives had been in 'immediate danger' from the knifeman.  </p>

<p>‘It was terrifying, especially as our two kids were there and there were lots of other children around,' she said.  </p>

<p>‘When we were moved to the departures are for further information staff confirmed our lives had been in immediate danger. So many what-ifs have been going through my head.</p>

<p>‘After we saw the police coming through with a Co-Op carrier bag with a flat white box in it, which must have contained the knives.’  </p>

<p>Traveller Hayley Wilkins was waiting for her baggage after landing just before 2am when there was an announcement urging people to evacuate.</p>

<p>Ms Wilkins, who wrote about the incident on Facebook, said she overheard the staff saying the man was an ex-employee and that lives were in danger.  </p>

<p>The suspect, who was struck by the 50,000-volt Taser before being handcuffed and taken away by police, was earlier spotted making his way to the airport by a neighbour.</p>

<p>Callum Oldfield, 21, said he briefly spoke to the man at a bus stop in Ifield, West Sussex, and asked what he had in his bag.</p>

<p>He told the Independent: 'I said "what are you up to?" and he said: "I'm going to Gatwick for a massacre, I'm going to kill them all".'</p>

<p>Mr Oldfield, who like the arrested man is from Crawley, called the police after the 'uncomfortable' encounter after suspecting a flat box the man had inside a carrier bag contained knives.</p>

<p>He added: 'I took a couple of steps back. He was grinning like he’d won a load of money. He looked really, really happy. It was like he wasn’t all there.' </p>

<p>Another traveller, Atipin Kyerewaa, posted: 'At Gatwick airport, there was a security risk but police have just removed the guy, we've been told our lives were at risk.'</p>

<p>A 29-year-old holidaymaker who gave his name only as Adam said: 'Our baggage hadn't come through yet and we got an emergency tannoy saying there was a nasty incident and we must evacuate as soon as possible.</p>

<p>'The first thing I noticed was the baggage handlers leg it. There was a mad rush.'</p>

<p>Passengers were allowed to return at 2.45am. 'We are a bit shaken up. It was very much a close call,' Adam said.</p>

<p>Judge Gold handed Russell a 15-month suspended sentence along with requirements for treatment and rehabilitation. </p>
