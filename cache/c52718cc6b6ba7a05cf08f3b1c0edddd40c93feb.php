<p>Domino's Australia has offered diners a rare glimpse inside the kitchen showing exactly how the garlic bread pizza from its secret menu was made</p>

<p>'It all started when my mum [garlic bread] met my dad [pizza] and they fell in love and they had me,' a male voice can be heard saying in the footage.</p>

<p>To create the pizza, the employee spread tomato paste on the dough to create the classic crust base before adding six chunky slices of garlic bread.</p>

<p>Next, she stopped it with a generous amount of mozzarella cheese before she drizzled garlic butter all over.</p>

<p>Once its cooked in the oven, she removed the pizza from the pan and sprinkled green onion on top.</p>

<p>The video has since been viewed more than 23,000 times, with dozens of people describing it as a 'slice of heaven'.</p>

<p>'I need this in my life... wow,' one said, while another added: 'That looks amazing.' </p>

<p>The $7.95 creation is no longer available to purchase after it was sold for one week only - but many called on the pizza chain to bring it back to its secret menu.</p>

<p>The pizza was created by the Domino's chief garlic bread taste tester Zach Gracie.</p>

<p>'I spent hours experimenting in the Domino's development kitchen, dreaming up all sorts of pizza and garlic bread innovations,' he said. </p>

<p>'I remember thinking "I know it sounds crazy... but what if I combine garlic bread and pizza?" So I did, and it was beautiful.</p>

<p>'I think that was one of my proudest moments as Domino's chief garlic bread taste tester, and I'm so excited that others can finally try my creation.'</p>

<p>A Domino's spokesperson previously described the pizza as a 'delicious carb-on-carb creation worth breaking those New Year's resolutions for'.</p>
