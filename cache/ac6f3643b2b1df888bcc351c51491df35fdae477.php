<p>The 32-year-old said: 'I was about to come out of the shop out the back when I saw the paramedics and emergency services.</p>

<p>'They were still working on him, pumping his chest, doing CPR, trying to save him. It was a shocking thing to see.</p>

<p>Other witnesses also claimed to have seen a car repeatedly run over the victim as he was lying on the ground.</p>

<p>A man in his 20s said: 'I heard something that sounded like someone groaning. I kept hearing it so went to the window and saw him lying, groaning on the ground.</p>

<p>'Then I saw a car come in and run over him. At first I was so shocked I couldn't tell what really happened, then it reversed and went 'bang' straight over him again.</p>

<p>'I was so shocked I couldn't believe it. I was like 'did I actually just see that?' I told my mum and she called the police. It was so crazy.'</p>
