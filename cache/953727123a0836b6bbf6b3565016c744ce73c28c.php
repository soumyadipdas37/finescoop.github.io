<p>Cornwall, Devon and Dorset will be bracing for a fresh influx of tourists as sunseekers flock to the sandy beaches in the South West.</p>

<p>Yet local MPs and police appear to be welcoming holidaymakers, with calls for people to be vigilant and stick to social distancing rules.</p>

<p>MP for East Devon Simon Jupp told MailOnline: 'I'm really encouraged by the continued low level of cases of coronavirus in Devon and the South West, despite the number of visitors which provided a much-needed cash-flow into our economy.</p>

<p>'It's still as critical as ever that people take personal responsibility to keep themselves and each other safe – hand washing, covering your face in certain indoor settings, and getting a test if you've got symptoms.</p>

<p>'The new restrictions are easier to understand and easier to enforce. We should all play our part to help beat the virus.' </p>

<p>MP for North Devon Selaine Saxby added: 'Cases remain low in North Devon this week, and our tourism and hospitality businesses are looking forward to seeing visitors as they have since lockdown eased.</p>

<p>'The vast majority of our visitors have been very compliant with the guidelines. Outdoors transmission remains low, and most travel to my constituency to enjoy the great outdoors.'</p>

<p>Gatherings of more than six people either indoors and outdoors, at home or in a pub will be illegal in England from Monday. A single household or support bubble that is larger than six will still be able to gather.</p>

<p>Covid-secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality settings can still hold more than six in total. </p>

<p>Education and work settings are not affected by the new rules. Weddings and funerals can also still go ahead with a limit of 30 people if conducted in a Covid-secure way.</p>
