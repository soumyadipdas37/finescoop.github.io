<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's the last tolerated prejudice. But Femail's had enough. It's time we called out those day-to-day moments when we're patronised for no longer being young... </p>

<p>It's a fact. By 2050 the over-60 age group will account for more than 20 per cent of the world's population.</p>

<p>We are, it turns out, the fastest-growing demographic and the market catering to our needs is predicted to be worth a whopping one trillion dollars.</p>

<p>Christa D'Souza (pictured) explains why seniors should start their own 'age tech' companies</p>

<p>In other words, enough with the 'OK Boomer-ing'. If you millennials and Gen-X-ers want to make it big, it is us you must look to for inspiration.</p>

<p>Ask anyone in Silicon Valley and they will tell you 'Age tech' — that's technology built around the needs and wants of older folk, fall prevention systems, in-built sonar alerts etc — is a very sexy field to get into right now.</p>

<p>Although as I write this, I am thinking, 'Shouldn't we ourselves be getting in on the act too? Why let everyone else make money off us?'</p>

<p>Only we know how our needs can genuinely be met, after all. And if the idea of making money off ageing sounds nuts, look no further than Helen Ruth Elam — aka Baddiewinkle — the 92-year-old Instagram influencer followed by the likes of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus, whose brand is already worth more than a million dollars. </p>

<p>Seniors just wanna have fun.</p>
