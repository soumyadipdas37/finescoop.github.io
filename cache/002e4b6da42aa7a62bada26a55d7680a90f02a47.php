<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Aubrey O'Day took to Twitter on Wednesday to pose in a high-leg purple swimsuit for a new video. </p>

<p>The post comes after the Danity Kane alum, 36, stepped out looking remarkably different as she took a walk in Palm Springs on Sunday. </p>

<p>Aubrey had a heavy filter applied to her video, which applied a flower garland to her head, heavy make-up and speckles of light to the appearance of the clip. </p>

<p>Walking the dogs: Aubrey looked unrecognizable when she emerged for a quiet stroll with her dogs on Sunday in Palm Springs… 16 years after finding fame as a pop star in Danity Kane</p>

<p>While sitting in a rather sexy position, she asked fans for advice on how to decorate her glam room, saying she wanted to fill it with dried flowers. </p>

<p>A day after her outing in Palm Springs, Aubrey was straight on social media, posting two other stunning videos to her Instagram Story.</p>

<p>In the brief clips, O'Day had on a full face of makeup and her signature blonde tresses were styled in beach waves.</p>

<p>Making an impact: The singer and reality star got herself known for her daring red carpet looks, like this look (right) from 2012 in Las Vegas </p>

<p>She put her ample chest on display in a black crop top that completely exposed one side of her bra. </p>

<p>The singer did not say a word to the camera, instead, she pouted her lips and played with her freshly styled hair.</p>

<p>She also playfully stuck out her tongue just before the clip came to a close</p>

<p>In a note layered over top her video, Aubrey informed her nearly 1million followers that she was jamming to music, while 'redesigning [her] glam room.'</p>

<p>On Sunday, Aubrey relied solely on her natural beauty as she took her two dogs for a walk and picked up some food to-go in Palm Springs. </p>

<p>The sighting came just a week after she posted an advertisement for the Flat Tummy App on her Instagram account that showed her in a revealing swimsuit, though it appears to have been heavily airbrushed.  </p>

<p>'Can't wait to see the progress as I continue the workouts,' Aubrey captioned the snap from August 20, which she posted to her 936,000 followers. </p>

<p>She added: 'Nothing beats a poolside workout, and with my new <?php echo e('@'); ?>flattummyapp I can do my workout anywhere, anytime.' </p>

<p>What was recognizable about the 5′ 4″ star's appearance was her tattoos. Aubrey has previously shown off her bar code neck tattoo, and Latin scripture ink on her torso.</p>

<p>The Latin slogan emblazoned on her side reads: 'Per aspera ad astra,' loosely translated as 'through hardships to the stars.' </p>

<p>The star - who has appeared in both Celebrity Apprentice and Celebrity Big Brother - has posted a series of bikini shots on social media over the last few months, though it is not clear when the pictures were taken. </p>

<p>On July 15, she posted a string of bikini shots, wearing Rihanna's Savage X Fenty line and made sure to tag the brand in her post. </p>

<p>Aubrey is still an active member of the band Danity Kane, which now appears to be a duo, having reunited for a second time as a trio in 2018.  </p>

<p>Inking: This Instagram snap - posted in January this year - shows a very recognizable tattoo </p>

<p>Along with singer Dawn Richard, the pair released the electronic single New Kings earlier this year in March. </p>

<p>She has also been posting videos of fans dancing to their new music on her Instagram account. </p>

<p>Last week, Aubrey posted a tribute to her beloved pooches on Twitter for National Dog Day, showing off their multicolored fur. </p>

<p>Fans have speculated about her changing looks over the years, but in an interview Aubrey admitted that she knows 'all the tricks' when it comes to making your appearance seem different. </p>

<p>'I've had lip fillers and Botox. I put a lot of filters,' she told UsWeekly just last year, adding: 'I know all the tricks and I use them.' </p>

<p>However, she denied rumors that she's had extensive plastic surgery done.  </p>

<p>The reality star allegedly had an affair with Donald Trump Jr. in 2012, while he was married to his wife Vanessa Trump.</p>

<p>The pair met while on the set of season 5 of the Celebrity Apprentice back in 2011.</p>

<p>For the love of dogs: The reality personality has always been proud of her pampered pooches</p>

<p>Aubrey publicly called Donald Jr. her 'ex' for the first time during the season premiere of MTV's Ex on the Beach, last year, before also calling him her 'soulmate.' </p>

<p>She also split from Jersey Shore's Paul 'DJ Pauly D' DelVecchio in July 2017, and it is not clear if she is currently dating.  </p>

<p>As well as her singing and TV career, the star made a name for herself opting for daring red carpet ensembles, often wearing very little while turning up to events.  </p>
