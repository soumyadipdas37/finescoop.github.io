<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A vegan couple's decision to ignore health advice resulted in their baby developing cerebral palsy because it lacked sufficient nutrients, a court has heard.</p>

<p>The one-year-old girl was subjected to a strict plant-based diet which eventually landed her in the intensive care unit at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. </p>

<p>The child was in such bad shape, doctor's likened her condition to newborns in developing countries experiencing famine.</p>

<p>Her parents pleaded guilty to negligently causing serious injury to the child at Victoria's County Court on Friday.</p>

<p>A vegan couple's decision to ignore health advice resulted in their baby developing cerebral palsy because it lacked sufficient nutrients, a court has heard</p>

<p>The child suffered widespread bruising, discoloured skin, rashes covering her body and had multiple open wounds as a result of the parent's vegan diet. </p>

<p>Upon closer inspection doctors discovered she had internal bleeding and bloody stools, reported the Age.   </p>

<p>After the health check at Geelong Hospital she was taken the to Royal Children's Hospital and spent a month in the intensive care unit. </p>

<p>It was later discovered the onset of the toddler's disability was diet related, court documents revealed. </p>

<p>'[The baby] has cerebral palsy as a result of brain injury secondary to malnutrition,' the Clinical Director of the Royal Children's Hospital Rehabilitation Service, Dr Neil Wimalasundera wrote.</p>

<p>Her parents had been feeding her a diet without animal products, despite advice from medical professionals their nutritional plan was inadequate.</p>

<p>Her parents pleaded guilty to negligently causing serious injury to the child at Victoria's County Court (pictured) on Friday</p>

<p>The one-year-old girl was subjected to a strict plant-based diet which eventually landed her in the intensive care unit at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital (pictured)</p>

<p>They had ignored repeated advice from doctors before distancing themselves entirely from mainstream medicine. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Justin Lewis told the court one nurse became so worried for the child's health after the parents disappeared she considered escalating the matter.</p>

<p>But they allegedly dismissed her concerns by threatening to lodge a complaint against her.  </p>

<p>He also told the court the father had been making his own baby formula out of dates, fruits and vegetables because he couldn't find a vegan alternative. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the father has since ditched veganism entirely.   </p>

<p>County Court judge Claire Quin condemned the parents' behaviour, particularly their decision to ignore advice from medical professionals. </p>

<p>Another couple (pictured) had their child taken off them after their dietary choices left it malnourished in New South Wales last August</p>

<p>The extreme vegan diet left another 20-month-old severely malnourished in NSW </p>

<p>The toddler could not crawl or even roll over when first taken to hospital</p>

<p>'These parents, they weren't 19 or 20 years old, they were in their early 30s,' Judge Quin said.</p>

<p>'They're told that what they're contemplating isn't going to work for their infant, but they continue to do it.'  </p>

<p>The couple have since separated, after having a second child together. </p>

<p>They will be sentenced later this month.</p>

<p>The incident comes almost a year after another couple had their child taken off them after their dietary choices left it malnourished in New South Wales.</p>

<p>The pair avoided jail time after being found guilty of neglect after failing to adequately feed their 20-month-old baby girl.   </p>

<p>The extreme vegan diet left the 20-month-old severely malnourished. </p>

<p>At the time she had no teeth, could not stand up, weighed less than 5kg (11lbs) and looked like a three-month-old. </p>

<p>The child, who was fed a diet relying on oats and rice milk, was 'defenceless and unable to protect herself from her parents, and developed rickets. </p>

<p>Around 3.5million people living in the UK are vegan – the equivalent of around seven per cent of the population, according to estimates.</p>

<p>And, as the diet has surged in popularity, more mothers are choosing to make their baby a vegan.</p>

<p>The NHS says babies and young children on a vegetarian or vegan diet can get the energy and most of the nutrients they need to grow and develop.</p>

<p>However, the plant-based diet is known to be low in key nutrients for babies, such as vitamin B12 - found milk and eggs, iron, calcium and zinc.</p>

<p>A vitamin B12 deficiency is a rare and treatable cause of failure to thrive and delayed development in infants, researchers wrote in the journal Pediatrics.</p>

<p>It can also lead to malnutrition and ‘irreversible damage’ to their nervous systems, experts at University College London once concluded.</p>

<p>An iron deficiency can hinder a child from gaining weight, affect their appetite and energy and can lead to anaemia, which can be life-threatening in severe cases.</p>

<p>Consuming too little protein can lead to stunted growth, nutritionists have warned over the years. But beans, lentils and chickpeas are high in the nutrient.</p>

<p>And eating too much fibre can cause children to feel full quicker and stop them from getting enough food, paediatric dietitian Lucy Upton told the Mail in March.</p>

<p>Two senior lecturers in nutrition at Cardiff Metropolitan University, Shirley Hinde and Ruth Fairchild, said the diet was ‘less than ideal’ for babies.</p>

<p>However, writing in The Conversation they added it is ‘not out of the question’ that the diet could be healthy for a baby.</p>

<p>And they claimed there is ‘no reason’ why a baby couldn’t survive on a vegan diet that was varied in many nutrients, if their parents were sensible.</p>
