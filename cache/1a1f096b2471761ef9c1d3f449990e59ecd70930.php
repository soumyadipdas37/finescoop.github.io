<p>­Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson said it was now more important than ever to stand up to the Asian powerhouse.   </p>

<p>Ms Adamson said confronting China amid the coronavirus crisis had prompted Australia's most difficult diplomatic challenge in a generation. </p>

<p>The 59-year-old, who was Australia's ambassador in Beijing­ from 2011 to 2015, explained the Asian nation was becoming more assertive.       </p>

<p>'We've seen China seeking to assert itself in this region, in the Indo-Pacific and globally, in ways that suits its interests but don't suit the interests of countries like­Australia,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Adamson said Australians wanted 'a peaceful, stable, prosperous region' and the government would not tolerate any interference with these ideals.  </p>

<p>She warned that democratic institutions Australians take for granted, like the legal system and parliament, were 'at stake'.  </p>

<p>'We need to make sure our institutions are strong and that we can defend ourselves. And this is where the role of diplomacy comes into play,' Ms Adamson explained. </p>

<p>She said Australia needed to 'take action' to counter the 'direct challenge' posed by China's assertion and aggression.  </p>

<p>The DFAT secretary also said the narrow escape of two Australian journalists from China was the latest example of 'difficult issues' between the two countries.   </p>

<p>Chinese police told the journalists they were people of interest after another Australian journalist and business anchor, Cheng Lei, was detained in Beijing.  </p>

<p>Mr Birtles and Mr Smith sheltered in Australian diplomatic compounds for days as their travel rights were revoked.</p>

<p>Consular officials eventually secured safe passage back to Australia after the pair agreed to be interviewed. </p>

<p>The Australian government has advised all Australians not to travel to China, warning they could face arbitrary detention.   </p>
