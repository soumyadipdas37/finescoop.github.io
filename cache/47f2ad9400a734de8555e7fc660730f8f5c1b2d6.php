<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren accused President Donald Trump with 'flirting with treason' following the president's refusal to commit to a peaceful transfer of power earlier this week.</p>

<p>Warren, a former presidential candidate who is seen as a key advisor of former Vice President Joe Biden's when it comes to policy and personnel, made the comment on MSNBC as some Republicans sought to clean up or otherwise explain the president's comments.</p>

<p>Trump himself said Thursday he isn't sure the election could be 'honest,' and White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said he will accept the results of a 'free and fair election.'</p>

<p>'When Donald Trump says that he is not necessarily going to accept the will of the voters, he's flirting with treason,' Sen. Elizabeth Warren said on MSNBC</p>

<p>'When Donald Trump says that he is not necessarily going to accept the will of the voters, he's flirting with treason,' Warren told MSBNC's Chris Hayes. </p>

<p>She continued: 'He's saying, peaceful transition of power doesn't matter to him. All that matters to him, once again, is Donald Trump and whatever Donald Trump wants.' she said, Yahoo News reported.</p>

<p>She accused GOP senators of enabling Trump. Several Republicans came out Thursday to state that the nation would accept the results of the elections, although none appeared to chastise Trump for his remarks. </p>

<p>At the same time, Trump appears to have locked up total support from within his party for the person he will nominate for the lifetime appointment to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg – including from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who criticized Trump's comments on the transition of power. </p>

<p>''Fundamental to democracy is the peaceful transition of power,' Romney said Wednesday evening. 'Any suggestion that a president might not respect this Constitutional guarantee is both unthinkable and unacceptable,' she said. </p>

<p>Warren made the comments on 'All in with Chris Hayes' on MSNBC</p>

<p>President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power</p>

<p>Warren said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has ''a spine kept in a box somewhere else, because he certainly doesn't have it to exercise for himself'</p>

<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Thursday Trump was 'attempting massive voter suppression'</p>

<p>'These Republicans senators, to enable him in that, to support him in that, and to start to talk about the Nov. 3 election as if this isn't about voters getting their choice, but it's about Supreme Court justices getting their choice,' she said.</p>

<p>She said it 'means that they are a party to it,' she added.</p>

<p>She tore into Sen. Lindsey Graham, who told people to 'use those words against me' when he said he would oppose taking up a nomination an election year the next time around, but said immediately after Ginsburg's death he is scheduling hearings days before Election Day.</p>

<p>'Lindsey Graham has simply said, 'Donald Trump has my proxy on this. Senate doesn't need to look at it. If the president's good, Lindsey Graham is good.' Man, there's a man with a spine,' she said. She called it 'a spine kept in a box somewhere else, because he certainly doesn't have it to exercise for himself.' </p>

<p>Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Thursday Trump was 'attempting massive voter suppression' and was  'sowing the seeds of chaos, confusion and conspiracy theories by casting doubt on the integrity of this election.'</p>

<p>'This is an election between Donald Trump and democracy - and democracy must win,' sanders added, having lost the Democratic nomination to Joe Biden months ago. </p>

<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted early Thursday that 'The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th.'</p>

<p>'There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,' he continued. </p>

<p>Trump set off a political storm with his comments Wednesday when he was asked at the White House: 'Win lose or draw in this election will you commit here today for a peaceful transferal of power after the election?' </p>

<p>'Well, we'll have to see what happens,' Trump replied – entertaining the question, but also refusing to commit. </p>

<p>'Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful – there won't be a transfer frankly, there'll be a continuation,' Trump said. </p>
