<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been pictured out with his wife after celebrating Arsenal's Community Shield win, with fans still no clearer to knowing if he has signed a new £250,000-a-week deal.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old scored the opening goal of the game and the winning penalty as the Gunners overcame Liverpool on penalties at Wembley on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Arsenal captain was on hand to lift the trophy just a few weeks after getting his hands on the FA Cup trophy at the same venue. </p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been spotted out with his wife after Arsenal's victory</p>

<p>But Gunners fans are no clearer to knowing if the player has committed his future to the club</p>

<p>And the Gabon international has now been seen out and about with wife Alysha Behague after celebrating the victory in the season's curtain-raiser.</p>

<p>The striker was wearing a hoodie, jeans and pieces of jewellery and appeared to be in good spirits following his side's excellent start to the season.   </p>

<p>But it appears Gunners fans are no closer to knowing for sure if their star player has signed a new contract at the Emirates Stadium.</p>

<p>Aubameyang scored the only goal of the game and the winning penalty against Liverpool</p>

<p>Boss Mikel Arteta admitted that he believes his captain is close to agreeing a new three-year extension worth £250,000-a-week. </p>

<p>The Mirror claim Arsenal are planning to announce the deal before the start of the new Premier League season against Fulham after reports that talks have progressed well in recent weeks.</p>

<p>A superb finish from Aubameyang in the 12th minute was cancelled out by a second half goal from Takumi Minamino for the Reds at Wembley.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta announced after the game he was confident that an agreement was close</p>

<p>Arsenal won the match after the penalty shootout, as Rhian Brewster struck the crossbar and every Gunners penalty taker found the back of the net.</p>

<p>The Gunners are also considering keeping hold of Ainsley Maitland-Niles following his rich vein of form which has resulted in the 23-year-old receiving an England call-up.</p>

<p>The Gunners are close to completing a £27m deal for Lille defender Gabriel and have also targeted Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey whilst they continue to have talks with Real Madrid over a new loan deal for Dani Ceballos.</p>
