<p>Esther Abrami, a classical violinist from France, was having trouble playing music as her cat Rémila does not like being left alone on the floor. </p>

<p>The tiny kitten looks transfixed as Ms Abrami plays melodic classical music, footage taken by the cat lover shows.</p>

<p>Esther Abrami, a classical violinist from France, started putting her rescue kitten Rémila in a bum bag while she practices her music to stop the cat from crying out</p>

<p>In the video, Rémila falls fast asleep safely tucked inside the bag as Ms Abrami plays Apres Un Reve by Gabriel Faure on the violin.</p>

<p>Rémila seems to have taken advice from the piece of music by the French composer - which is all about sleeping peacefully and dreaming.</p>

<p>Rémila was abandoned but was rescued by cat shelter Association Féli-Cité, where Ms Abrami works as a 'host family' for cats.</p>

<p>Sharing the video on Instagram, she wrote: 'When she arrived she was less than 400 grams, scared and had breathing issues from having stayed outside for several days.</p>

<p>'I’m happy to say that after 7 days of milk bottles and constant cuddles Rémila has now become one of the friendliest cats I’ve ever seen. She follows me absolutely everywhere around the house and refuses to be left alone on the floor. </p>

<p>'She is always either on my laps or in her little bag around my waist.'</p>
