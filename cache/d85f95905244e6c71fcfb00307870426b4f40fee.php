<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Facebook has been going all in on augmented reality but the company isn't just focused on what we see. </p>

<p>In a post, the social media firm peeled back the curtain on Facebook Reality Labs' pioneering work developing audio-enhancing technology.</p>

<p>Their goal is to perfect 'audio presence,' where sounds from speakers, headphones or other devices are indistinguishable from a real-world source.</p>

<p>They're also developing 'perceptual superpowers,' technology that tunes out background noise and let us focus on the person speaking to us by tracking the user's eye movements.</p>

<p>Facebook Reality Labs is perfecting technology that would enable a phone call from a crowded bar to sound crystal clear. It's also working to make sounds coming through speakers or headphones virtually identical to a real world source</p>

<p>Neither one is coming to market any time soon, but the technologies could have life-changing applications, including for those who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p>

<p>It's likely the research will also finds its way into Facebook's augmented reality glasses, expected to roll out some time between 2023 and 2025.</p>

<p> A top-flight team of researchers, engineers and designers are dedicated to enhancing what we hear, so that a conversation in a crowded cafe or a phone call from a thousands miles away both sound crystal clear.</p>

<p>By analyzing your eye and head movements, Facebook's AR glasses with embedded speakers could identify what you're trying to hear and dampen extraneous noise. </p>

<p>Trying to listen to your date in a noisy bar? Stare into their eyes and the argument at the next table fades into a whisper. </p>

<p>The tech could also be incorporated with Facebook's LiveMaps feature, with AI automatically screening out traffic and other distractions.</p>

<p>'We are exploring new technologies that can extend, protect, and enhance your hearing ability — giving you the ability to increase concentration and focus, while allowing you to seamlessly interact with the people and information you care about,' explains hardware research lead Tony Miller.</p>

<p>This isn't just theoretical, as the lab has already developed prototypes that can track eye movements and adjust sounds accordingly. </p>

<p>Facebook Research Lab scientist Pablo Hoffmann (pictured) says spatial audio could be combined with ultra-realistic avatars and full-body tracking to create a virtual meeting indistinguishable from a face-to-face encounter</p>

<p>An always-on audio calibration system effectively lets users hear sounds in ultra-high fidelity through a pair of headphones with virtually no distortion or coloration.</p>

<p>The effect is that the recording is basically identical to the original, according to Oculus blog writer Lisa Brown Jaloza.</p>

<p>'It's so realistic, it's virtually indistinguishable from the real thing,' she writes after listening to research scientist Pablo Hoffman talk and then hearing the playback.</p>

<p>Facebook Research Labs' in-ear audio monitors. While a lot of the work started out as part of AR and VR, says researcher Philip Robinson, 'We realized that all of the technologies that we're building here can serve a higher purpose, which is to improve human hearing'</p>

<p>'In fact, sitting next to him at his desk, I'd bet money that he's talking to me as I see him in my peripheral vision.'</p>

<p>Spatial audio could also be combined with ultra-realistic avatars and full-body tracking to create a virtual meeting indistinguishable from a face-to-face encounter.</p>

<p>Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation of an environment or situation</p>

<p>In contrast, augmented reality layers computer-generated images on top of an existing reality</p>

<p>'Imagine if you were on a phone call and you forgot that you were separated by distance,' researcher Philip Robinson says. 'That's the promise of the technology we're developing.'</p>

<p>Robinson says while a lot of the work his team is doing started out as part of AR and VR, 'We realized that all of the technologies that we're building here can serve a higher purpose, which is to improve human hearing.' </p>

<p>In one experiment, Research scientist Vladimir Tourbabin calls Jaloza's phone from a room playing loud music. Tourbabin flips a switch and his voice comes through clear as day.</p>

<p>'It's as if someone's turned down the volume of the background noise so I can easily focus in on what he's trying to say,' she writes. </p>

<p>The key is a set of microphones on Tourbabin's glasses that isolate his voice from the background noise.</p>

<p>'The moment we're in is such a crucial moment in the history of AR/VR technology,' says Ravish Mehra, research science lead for FRL's audio team. </p>

<p>'Five or 10 years from now, if somebody joins the field, they'll be chasing tail lights. At this moment, we can actually define what the future can be.'   </p>

<p>Facebook has partnered with Ray-Ban parent company Luxottica on its AR glasses, CNBC reported last fall. </p>

<p>Codenamed Orion, the smart shades will replace smartphones, allowing users to make calls, view information on a small display, and live-stream their visual perspective to followers on social media.</p>
