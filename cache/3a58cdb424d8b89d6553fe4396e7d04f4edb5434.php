<p>There are hundreds of examples on Facebook for those unsure of what to place inside, with many using it to surprise teenage sons and daughters.</p>

<p>'This is the first shadow box I've done for my son's 13th birthday. He was most disappointed when he thought he got a picture frame, but delighted when he turned it over and saw all of the treats inside,' one mother shared online.</p>

<p>'These are just some of the shadow box frames that I have done for our two children, husband and three of our nieces. They all loved them. Such a great gift, no matter the budget or occasion,' another said.</p>

<p>Chocolate and cash were popular present choices inside of the shadow box</p>

<p>The gifts were still personalised with products the receiver would like </p>

<p>Some people used sticky tape to pin the items to the back of the box, so everything didn't move around</p>

<li><p>Find out the person's favourite chocolate bars and purchase a few of them.</p></li>
<li><p>Use gift cards to make up 'holes' or spaces in the box.</p></li>
<li><p>Concert tickets, makeup and toiletries are 'useful' gifts for people.</p></li>
<li><p>Cash is always a welcome sight and can be used as another space filler.</p></li>
<li><p>Perfume, notebooks, lip balm and jewellery accessories are also a touching gift.</p></li>
<li><p>Video games are often included, as are card games. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Some parents hid a car key in their children's shadow box - as a surprise for what was waiting outside - while others used it to stock up on makeup or jewellery.  </p>

<p>Concert tickets, swimwear, perfume, notebooks and cards could also be arranged in the box, although some cautioned that it requires 'more patience than you realise'.</p>

<p>'First and last shadow box for my 12-year-old birthday boy... It took more patience then I expected to line everything up without anything moving around,' one lady said.</p>

<p>The finishing touches usually include adding letters or a message to the outside of the frame or fairy lights placed carefully inside. </p>

<p>While the original shadow box from Kmart can be difficult to find because it's regularly out of stock, some clever customers have improvised with regular photo frames and jewellery boxes</p>

<p>Can't find a shadow box? Never fear, some people just picked up a bigger photo frame and put flat products in it</p>

<p>Some didn't even put presents inside and just used the box as a card</p>

<p>'I finally got my hands on a shadow box and have decided to fill it with 'emergency supplies' for a mother-to-be... these boxes really can be used for any event, and I spent less than $100 putting it together,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'The shadow box was perfect for a last minute put-together present for my mum. Nothing extravagant as times are tough at the moment, but her reaction to it was the best present,' said another.</p>
