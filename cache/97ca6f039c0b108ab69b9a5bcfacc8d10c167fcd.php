<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An appeal for new residents on a remote Scottish island has attracted more than 400 applications from around the world - with Covid helping with the search.</p>

<p>The Isle of Rum, Inner Hebrides, put out a call for tenants to join the population of around just 30 people after building four new two-bedroom eco homes. </p>

<p>Applications came in from countries, including Argentina, USA, Australia, Spain and Italy. </p>

<p>There have also been a number of bids made by Londoners looking to swap the city for life on the island, which has only one community shop. </p>

<p>More than 3,000 notes of interest landed in the trust's inbox, with inquiries coming from countries including India and Pakistan.</p>

<p>Rum is known as the 'Forbidden Island', situated twenty miles off Scotland's west coast, with ferries only running four times a week in winter. </p>

<p>The Isle of Rum Community Trust, which launched the search for new residents, hope to raise the population of the island to 60 people with the new housing.</p>

<p>The greater resident numbers will support the island school, which has a roll of just two, as well as future investment and infrastructure projects.</p>

<p>Steve Robertson, development manager at the trust, said he was 'very pleased' with the response and said the pandemic may have helped to drive the high level of interest.</p>

<p>Mr Robertson said that Covid-19 has been 'mentioned a few times' and has perhaps helped the interest in living on Rum.</p>

<p>He said: 'If there is further lockdown, you have all the space on the island, the beaches, the cliffs.</p>

<p>'There does seem to be something special about the idea of completely breaking from whatever life you have and moving to a small island.</p>

<p>'It can work really well for people. Some people might not stay forever, but it can be a really nice section in people's lives.</p>

<p>He said the trust is 'sifting through the applications' and that there are 'a lot of really good candidates'.   </p>

<p>Mr Robertson said consideration would particularly be given to small families and those who had a business they could take to the island.</p>

<p>He added: 'Trades people would be a great asset here.</p>

<p>'It could be a handyperson but if someone had the tickets for the relevant trades and be willing to use them on Rum, that would be a great help.'</p>

<p>He said some applicants had shown interest in taking up one of the homes and building other properties on the island, to help drive further population growth.</p>

<p>All homes on the island are fitted with high quality fibre broadband, allowing people to work from home, with other jobs in childcare, food production and house maintenance.</p>

<p>Care will be taken to get the right fit of people for the island, where challenges include the lack of healthcare.</p>

<p>Mr Robertson added: 'Candidates have to convince the board that they have an understanding of the challenges of moving into a small community.</p>

<p>'Whether you are from London, New York or Glasgow, it is a challenge.</p>

<p>'Over the years, we have had people come and leave because it has not worked out for them.</p>

<p>'Others have come, thought they wouldn't stay but then have become really key people on the island.</p>

<p>'We might not get it perfect but we will do our best to make it clear to newcomers as to what they might expect from moving to Rum.'</p>
