<p>Debbie, 36 </p>

<p>Dating Past?</p>

<p>I've never found someone who ticks all the boxes. I have lived with two men, but I've never been on an active hunt for a partner. And I don't have a biological clock ticking as I don't want children. I had my last fling while working in Ibiza in 2016.</p>

<p>Pre-Date Nerves?</p>

<p>Single for two years, no children.</p>

<p>Current role</p>

<p>Performing artist and event manager.</p>

<p>Would like to meet</p>

<p>A BUBBLY alpha male. I'm quite focused on looks, and I'd rather he had no kids.</p>

<p>I Am used to being thrown in at the deep end at work, so I don't get nervous.</p>

<p>First Impressions?</p>

<p>I arrived first, and on time, at the vegan restaurant Equador had chosen. He was a little late, but he'd let me know he would be.</p>

<p>I have a boho chic fashion sense and was intrigued by Equador's long hair, beard and purple suit. We were quite well matched when it came to our style, outlook on life and jobs.</p>

<p>Easy To Talk To?</p>

<p>Equador does have an attractive character, but I wasn't sure if he was boyfriend material because he didn't come across as an alpha male. While I'm a performer and a bohemian at heart, I'm also a business woman with a foot in the corporate world and need someone with a strong personality.</p>

<p>However, he did give a lot of feedback to the waiting staff about the freshness of the ingredients and the saltiness of our food, which was assertive. It could get annoying if he did this on a regular basis, though.</p>

<p>We're both in the entertainment industry and discovered we know some of the same people. Plus, he's a trained dancer, and I dance, too. He was also born in Strasbourg in France, and I lived there for four years.</p>

<p>Embarrassing Moments?</p>

<p>When I went to the loo, Equador hid behind the door frame and jumped out at me as I left, giving me a fright. It was unexpected and fun.</p>

<p>Did Sparks Fly?</p>

<p>I liked Equador's quirkiness but the initial attraction wasn't there for me. As the date progressed I felt like he could be in the friend zone, and I would like to get to know him more as a friend.</p>

<p>What do you think he thought of you?</p>

<p>He quite liked me, and asked about meeting up again. When he took my address to organise a taxi he looked up when non-residents can park for free.</p>

<p>We'd ordered so much food that we agreed to take some home and video chat the next day, but I had a medical emergency and couldn't make it. We will meet again with no expectations.</p>

<p>Would your family like him?</p>

<p>Yes, Equador is a friendly person, and no one I know would be negative about him. </p>

<p>Equador, 36 </p>

<p>Dating Past?</p>

<p>I've had a few long-term girlfriends and, many years ago, I used to date a lot.</p>

<p>However, these days I go through phases of celibacy by choice. Now I value deeper connections.</p>

<p>Pre-date nerves?</p>

<p>As an entertainer I'm used to meeting new people, but I told myself to be on my best behaviour.</p>

<p>I've never been on a blind date before, but decided to go with the flow. I'm open to seeing what happens next, romantically.</p>

<p>First Impressions?</p>

<p>Single for 18 months, no children.</p>

<p>Current role</p>

<p>Bubble and magic entertainer.</p>

<p>Would like to meet</p>

<p>An active woman. She doesn't have to be perfect, but ideally she'd be interested in personal growth — and have no children.</p>

<p>I was slightly anxious because I was held up in North London traffic. As I arrived, I saw a beautiful woman in a long, flowing dress. She looked like a sparkling angel — I really wanted her to be my date. I was so glad I wore my smart purple suit.</p>

<p>Debbie was immediately warm, welcoming and friendly. I was impressed by the match.</p>

<p>Easy to talk to?</p>

<p>Debbie is quietly assertive. She rejected the first table we were shown to because it was out of the way, and I liked that about her. We did get seated at a much better table as a result.</p>

<p>We talked about our work as dancers and I offered to help Debbie with choreography for an upcoming show.We touched on art, our careers and food preferences, too — I mostly have a plant-based diet.</p>

<p>Embarrassing moments?</p>

<p>No, I wasn't aware of any.</p>

<p>Did sparks fly?</p>

<p>I felt chemistry between us. I'm not sure whether we'd be romantic partners, and at this stage I'd rather take things slow.</p>

<p>We were the last people to leave the restaurant, though, and agreed to see each other again. I then organised a cab for Debbie before getting a taxi myself.</p>

<p>We were going to eat our leftovers together on a Skype date, but unfortunately life got in the way as something came up for her.</p>

<p>What do you think she thought of you?</p>

<p>I hope she thought that I was an interesting, creative and rather quirky gentleman.</p>

<p>We've been getting to know each other more over text, although it's too soon to predict whether anything romantic will happen. It was a lovely experience and I'm happy to at least stay friends.</p>

<p>Would your friends like her?</p>

<p>I've got a diverse social circle and so has Debbie. I think she's the kind of person everyone likes.</p>

<p>Liked? He was good fun.</p>

<p>Regrets? None.</p>

<p>Coffee or cab? Coffee. </p>

<p>Liked? She is lovely.</p>

<p>Regrets? None.</p>

<p>Coffee or cab? Coffee.</p>
