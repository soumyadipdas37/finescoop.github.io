<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Channel Ten's The Masked Singer has been hit by claims the performances are prerecorded.</p>

<p>On Friday, an alleged industry insider told The Sunday Telegraph the celebrities on the show don't perform live and they only wear their costumes during the unveiling.</p>

<p>'All the vocals are prerecorded prior to filming and the performances are done by dancers or doubles,' the source said. </p>

<p>Claims: An insider claimed celebrities on Channel Ten's The Masked Singer 'pre-record their vocals' and 'the performances are done by doubles' on Friday. Pictured Jackie O Henderson</p>

<p>'They don't perform at all. It's written in to their contracts,' the insider claimed.</p>

<p>However, a Channel Ten spokesperson denied the claims and told the publication the celebrities perform on stage.  </p>

<p>'These claims are rubbish. Don't know who this crew member is but they clearly have no idea,' the spokesperson said. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, judge Jackie 'O' Henderson and host Osher Günsberg were granted hotel quarantine exemptions from NSW authorities to film the finale in Sydney on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Both stars were allowed back into the state after undergoing a mandatory 14 days of self isolation in Melbourne, following an outbreak of COVID-19 on the show's set.</p>

<p>With several key cast members in different states, the crew had to get very creative when it came to producing the grand finale.</p>
