<p>'You don't have to deal with COVID if ur rich,' sniped one fan in the comments of a post.</p>

<p>'Is the pandemic over for rich people? I just see them taking luxurious vacations to tropical places or Europe like how is Kylie Jenner in Paris rn I don't understand,' wrote another.</p>

<p>Another remarked, 'Kylie Jenner going to Paris during Covid while the rest of the world can't travel or visit family in other countries/states due to border restrictions just doesn't sit well with me.' </p>

<p>Pandemic outrage: The trip sparked outrage from social media users, as she ignored California guidelines not to travel, and she seemed to have ignored EU travel bans on Americans</p>

<p>Kylie seemed to have ignored guidelines issued by California Governor Gavin Newsom restricting travel.</p>

<p>The state government's official website website currently urges people to only travel for 'urgent matters.'</p>

<p>There have been nearly 13,000 deaths from the pandemic in the state of California, with over 700,000 cases. </p>

<p>In all of the US, 183,000 people have succumbed to COVID-19, while a stunning six million have tested positive for the illness</p>
