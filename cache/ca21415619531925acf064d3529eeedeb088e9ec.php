<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Virgil van Dijk's attitude has been slammed by Dutch legend Wim Kieft, who believes the Liverpool star has become 'lazy and nonchalant'.</p>

<p>The Holland centre-back has enjoyed a meteoric rise since making the move from Southampton to Liverpool in 2018 and finished second in last year's Ballon d'Or rankings.</p>

<p>But he was blasted as 'arrogant' by Jamie Carragher during their opening day victory over Leeds earlier this month, and Euro 1988 winner Kieft has urged the 29-year-old to stay grounded.</p>

<p>The Liverpool and Holland centre-back has been critcised by Dutch legend Wim Kieft</p>

<p>'He is not sharp, he behaves with the Oranje and Liverpool like the finished star, the great coaching leader, who shows a little too much that he does not like his fellow players', he told De Telegraaf.</p>

<p>'At the same time, he plays lazy and nonchalant himself. He makes mistakes and often runs away from defensive handiwork in matches. With his status, he should be at the forefront of the battle.</p>

<p>'It took Van Dijk a long time to get to the top international level. He has been there for about two seasons now, but it is important that Van Dijk remains very critical of himself. His environment also plays an important role in this.</p>

<p>Van DIjk made a rare error during Liverpool's opening day win over Leeds this month</p>

<p>'It's okay if his trainers shake him up a lot.'</p>

<p>Van Dijk helped Liverpool keep a clean sheet in their 2-0 victory at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, but just a week beforeÂ was punished for a loose touch on the edge of the penalty area that allowed Patrick Bamford capitalised to score in a thrilling game against Leeds.</p>

<p>Carragher, on co-commentary duties for Sky Sports, didn't hold back when lashing out at the towering Dutchman, and Graeme Souness echoed his comments, saying: 'Van Dijk has had an absolute stinker'.</p>
