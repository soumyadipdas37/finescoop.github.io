<p>Both of the suspects were well known to authorities. </p>

<p>In another tragic incident, a couple in the county was forced to watch on a livestream as thieves broke into the home they had evacuated just days earlier.</p>

<p>Tracy and Marvin Johnson, who live in the unincorporated hamlet of Beavercreek in Clackamas County, recalled for KION 6 News how they watched the robbery unfold on their doorbell camera.</p>

<p>As well as the arrests, there were 54 criminal reports taken in these evacuation zones and 743 self-initiated activity calls in Clackamas County during those two weeks.  </p>

<p>Deputies also carried out 94 welfare checks and unaccounted person follow-ups as the state struggles to push back the historic wildfires. </p>

<p>Clackamas County is not the only area that has faced the threat of looters as the wildfires worsened. </p>

<p>In Marion County, two men were charged with looting properties that were evacuated by owners fleeing the deadly wildfire. </p>

<p>The escalating tensions and fear of crime have seen local residents begin posting signs bearing slogans like, ‘You loot, we shoot’ outside of their homes</p>

<p>Police in Oregon have arrested a string of suspected looters during the ongoing wildfires, as cops claim the criminals are making bogus 911 calls to divert officers elsewhere</p>

<p>Anthony Travis Bodda, 21, and Alexander Justin Jones, 36, were arrested on September 10 after they allegedly led law enforcement officials on a high-speed chase in fire-ravaged Santiam Canyon.  </p>

<p>As of Tuesday afternoon, close to one million acres had burned across the state since September 8, 2,584 acres of which was in Clackamas County. </p>

<p>It is the third-most populous county in the state with 75,000 residents and borders nearby Multnomah County, where Portland is located.  </p>

<p>There have been nine confirmed fatalities and five missing persons reported across the state, as well as at least 1,556 structures being destroyed. </p>

<p>There were ten active fires on Tuesday, down from eleven on Monday.   </p>

<p>There were still ten active fires in Oregon as of Monday</p>

<p>The fires have also left many residents with air quality warnings</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Oregon Office of Emergency Management was forced to dispel rumors that Antifa were starting fires in the state. </p>

<p>'Any disaster really starts up the rumor mill spinning whether it's where the fires are going to go, donations that are needed that can inundate emergency management with stuff that just adds to the complexity of the response,' Director Andrew Phelps told Fox. </p>

<p>'Rumors are never helpful, we always ask folks to get their information directly from local government sources and we rely on the accurate reporting of news partners across the state and around the country to get accurate and timely information out to the public to help us do our jobs, to control rumors and get accurate information.' </p>

<p>He added that the recovery from the fires will take years and that it's going to be a long-haul fight to get the fires in check. </p>

<p>Phelps said that recent wetter weather had helped somewhat but had also prevented aerial firefighting from going ahead.  </p>

<p>The fires are also having an impact on air quality in the area as smoke worsens. </p>
