<p>The Swans on Saturday said the club was aware of 'very serious' allegations made against Taylor.</p>

<p>Lekahni Pearce (pictured) - the now ex-girlfriend of 18-year-old Sydney Swans rookie Elijah Taylor who snuck into his AFL quarantine hub - has levelled domestic violence allegations against the young footy player</p>

<p>Taylor, 19, is being investigated by his team the Sydney Swans and the AFL over the allegations made on social media</p>

<p>Western Australia Police refused to comment on the post on Sunday.</p>

<p>'At this stage, WA Police Force is unable to provide comment,' a police spokesman said.</p>

<p>The manager of the AFL young gun Tom Seccull also refused to comment on the teenager's social media post, but acknowledged the severity of the allegations.</p>

<p>'Elijah, the club and AFL are all aware of the allegations,' Mr Seccull said in a statement.</p>

<p>'However, given the seriousness and sensitivity for those involved, we’re not in a position to comment further at this stage.' </p>

<p>The AFL on Sunday evening added the body had been notified of 'allegations made on social media'.</p>

<p>Pearce, 18, on Saturday night shared a photo of her bruised face and issued a series of accusations against Taylor</p>

<p>'The allegations are extremely serious. The AFL has been in contact with local law enforcement and will continue to provide support and assistance for all,' a league spokesman said.</p>

<p>'Due to the nature of the allegations the AFL will be providing no further comment at this time.'  </p>

<p>'The Sydney Swans are aware of allegations made on social media regarding first year player Elijah Taylor,' the 19-year-old's AFL side earlier said in a statement.</p>

<p>'The allegations are very serious and are being treated as such.</p>

<p>'The club has notified the AFL and is not in a position to comment further at this time.'</p>

<p>Drafted with pick 36 in the 2019 AFL Draft, Taylor played four games in his first year before being suspended over the COVID-19 bio-security breach.</p>

<p>Taylor's senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce in the hotel premises and raised the alarm.</p>

<p>Taylor's senior teammates reportedly discovered Ms Pearce (right) in the hotel premises and raised the alarm </p>

<p>She had reportedly crossed a golf course to be reunited with her then boyfriend. </p>

<p>Ms Pearce had just completed her own mandatory self-quarantine period after flying in from Sydney.</p>

<p>Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal, while his club was fined a total of $50,000 - with $25,000 suspended.</p>

<p>Swans coach John Longmire said the Western Australian-raised AFL talent had been specifically reminded about the strict protocols before he travelled to Perth.</p>

<p>Ms Pearce reportedly snuck across the golf course and into the resort where the players were staying</p>

<p>Taylor was sent home in the aftermath of the scandal and suspended for the rest of the AFL season over the breach</p>

<p>'We talked to Elijah specifically before we left and made sure that we all understand what environment we're going into,' Longmire told Fox Sports AFL 360.</p>

<p>'He still made a very poor choice, he still made a decision to deliberately breach the quarantine and it's unacceptable, and the ramifications are very much suited to what he did.'</p>

<p>'It was a decision that put so much at risk. He's only a young player, he's in his first year of AFL footy, but it was still a terrible decision that has big ramifications.'</p>
