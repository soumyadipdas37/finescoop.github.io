<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Exeter are gearing up for a landmark moment with more than a tinge of regret that they can’t greet French giants Toulouse with a dose of Devon bedlam at Sandy Park on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Chiefs have reached the semi-final of the European Champions Cup for the first time. It should be a vibrant occasion but the benefits of home advantage will be significantly diminished due to the empty stands.</p>

<p>Jack Nowell, Exeter’s England wing, expressed frustration on Wednesday on Twitter, saying: ‘How about this? Open sports stadiums to whoever wants to go and watch, if you don’t, stay at home. #justathought’.</p>

<p>Exeter's semi-final against French giants Toulouse will be played behind closed doors </p>

<p>His director of rugby, Rob Baxter, added: ‘It’s obviously disappointing. You always imagine quarter-finals and semi-finals of Europe being these huge occasions based on the build-up, flame-throwers around the pitch, music going on, the crowd going mad! </p>

<p>'They are amazing days and it is a shame, but it is still a great opportunity for the players in difficult circumstances and I think we are dealing with it very well.’</p>

<p>Baxter delivered a stark Covid warning: ‘It doesn’t take a genius to have concerns.</p>

<p>'I am a director, so I see the financial predictions and budgets. A lot of sports clubs are going to disappear. You can’t run businesses on zero finance.’</p>

<p>Director of Rugby Rob Baxter said it was a shame but still a great opportunity for his side</p>
