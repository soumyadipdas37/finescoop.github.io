<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A filmmaker has captured the first images of White Island since the New Zealand volcano erupted and killed 21 people on Dec. 9 last year. </p>

<p>Geoff Mackley went out to the island, 70 kilometres off the North Island coast, and sent up a drone to capture 'eerie' images of how the volcanic island looks now, ten months on from the disaster.</p>

<p>Forty-seven people were on the island when its volcano erupted, and only 26 people made it out alive, many with lifelong disfiguring and painful scarring.</p>

<p>Mackley said it was unnerving being out at the island, saying he 'thought about what went on out there and how terrible it would have been.' </p>

<p>A filmmaker has captured the first images of White Island less than a year after its volcano erupted and killed 21 people</p>

<p>Geoff Mackley stopped his boat near the shoreline of the death trap that sits just 70 kilometres off New Zealand's North Island</p>

<p>Although Mackley kept a safe distance away, he could still smell the sulphur emanating from the island</p>

<p>The few man-made structures on the island were obliterated by the eruption, with an abandoned helicopter the only physical reminder of the island's former status as a tourist drawcard.</p>

<p>Trips out to the island once brought in more than $4million a year but it is now deserted, with the layers of ash a reminder of the disaster. </p>

<p>'It's not like it was before, where there was clearly defined tracks,' Mackley said. </p>

<p>'They've been totally obliterated. It's like no-one has ever been there. So yeah, it's pretty eerie.' </p>

<p> It was now deemed too dangerous for tourists to return, and Mackley himself kept a safe distance.</p>

<p>'I know that it can blow up without warning at any time,' he told Stuff. 'It's Russian roulette.</p>

<p>'Something’s not highly likely to happen today, but if you were going out there every day, something will happen eventually.' </p>

<p>The eruption trapped tourists on the island, many unable to outrun the plumes of acidic gas and ash that surrounded them.</p>

<p>Some saw their entire families wiped out, others suffered excruciating burns to nearly all of their bodies and many have undergone dozens of surgeries or been placed into long comas.</p>

<p>Among the list of victims was Melbourne father Paul Browitt and his 21-year-old daughter Krystal. </p>

<p>His 23-year-old daughter Stephanie received third degree burns to 70 per cent of her body and lost a number of her fingers. </p>

<p>She was one of the few survivors who was airlifted off the island by a rescue helicopter. </p>

<p>What was once a tourism hotspot that brought in more than $4million a year, was now a deserted and burned up wasteland</p>

<p>The burned skeletal remains of tourism buildings stand alone and look ready to tumble at any moment</p>

<p>A damaged helicopter with a broken blade is one of the few things that remains standing on the island</p>

<p>The eruption trapped tourists on the island, many unable to outrun the plumes of acidic gas and ash that surrounded them</p>

<p>Photographs showed only one, damaged helicopter remains on the island.</p>

<p>The force of the eruption had lifted the vehicle off its landing pad and badly bent one of its main rotor blades.   </p>

<p>The burned remains of a building are one of the few things still standing on the abandoned island</p>

<p>Authorities have stopped anyone from visiting the island since its eruption in December 2019</p>

<p>Mackley lamented the fact there were plenty of hours in the day when the island was deserted and the volcano could have erupted</p>

<p>24 Australians were among 47 tourists on New Zealand's White Island when it erupted.   </p>
