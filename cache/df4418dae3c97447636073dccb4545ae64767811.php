<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wheelchair-bound model and Paralympic swimmer has revealed how she struggled to date with a disability before meeting the love of her life.  </p>

<p>Rebecca Dubber, 27, from Auckland, won bronze at the Rio Paralympics in 2016 before deciding to try dating apps to find a romantic partner.   </p>

<p>Dubber said her condition, caudal regression syndrome, used to hold her back from dating and had caused potential boyfriends to reject her. </p>

<p>'There were nights after I made a move on a guy I had a massive crush on, had been rejected, and would cry myself to sleep,' she told Stuff. </p>

<p>Runway model and Paralympic champion Rebecca Dubber (pictured above at New Zealand Fashion Week 2019) has shared her experiences of dating with a disability </p>

<p>Dubber, 27, (pictured) said she was scared to date and had often been rejected by potential boyfriends in the past because of her caudal regression syndrome</p>

<p>Dubber met her partner Mitchell McDonald (pictured left) through a dating app in late 2016. The pair are now engaged and Dubber said he was the 'love of her life'</p>

<p>The 27-year-old said she felt 'more comfortable' using dating apps so men could get to know her before finding out about she was wheelchair-bound.  </p>

<p>Dubber recalled her worst date ever after she failed to tell her new love interest about her disability.      </p>

<p>The pair met up for a drink and conversation flowed well before her date turned cold.</p>

<p>'I was trying to break the ice and asked him: ''Were you shocked when you saw me in my wheelchair?'' </p>

<p>'He had this stone-cold face, with no emotion, and said: ''It would have been nice to know beforehand," she said. </p>

<p>Dubber said she met her now-fiance, Mitchell McDonald, after talking on a dating app and eventually asking him out for coffee. </p>

<p>'Every little girl dreams of her fairytale fantasy of love at first sight but looking back I don't regret the way I met my partner. He's the love of my life,' she explained.  </p>

<p>Dubber (pictured) said she was 'more comfortable' using dating apps so dates could get to know her before finding out she was wheelchair-bound and meeting in person </p>

<p>The runway model said the pair became 'fast friends' before accidentally getting locked out of a building atop a flight of stairs on their fifth date. </p>

<p>Mr McDonald offered to find a way into the building and immediately went searching for half an hour. </p>

<p>Dubber worried that Mr McDonald had left and almost called her dad but he soon returned with a security guard to help. </p>

<p>The couple are now happily engaged and Dubber insists Mr McDonald is the 'love of her life'.    </p>

<p>She has also urged others to drop their biases and stereotypes around wheelchair users and people with disabilities. </p>

<p>Dubber said these stigmas need to be broken down so disabled people are more comfortable in the dating world.  </p>
