<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She recently received backlash for wearing a Jamaican-flag bikini with her hair in bantu knots, while he has been routinely criticized for attempting to speak Patois. </p>

<p>But it's safe to assume that Adele won't be impressed by the attention she's just received from self-styled rapper Chet Hanks. </p>

<p>The son of Tom Hanks - who is known for speaking in a fake Jamaican accent - has now attempted to hit on the British singer, after she was accused of 'cultural appropriation' for a Sunday Instagram post to mark the cancelled Notting Hill Carnival in London.</p>

<p>Set fire to her DMs: Tom Hanks' wannabe rapper son Chet - known for imitating a Jamaican accent - has hit on Adele after she wore a Jamaican-flag bikini and her hair in bantu knots</p>

<p>While many have come to the defense of the Someone Like You singer - including supermodel Naomi Campbell and Labour MP David Lammy - Chet used the moment  to be flirtatious with the 32-year-old star. </p>

<p>'PLEASE SOMEONE TELL ADELE HIT MY LINE ASAP !!!!!!!!!!!! I NEED TO TALK TO HER ABOUT SOMETHING,' Chet, 30, wrote excitedly in all capitals, as he posted a video of himself listening to her song Set Fire to the Rain while sat in his car. </p>

<p>Despite facing claims of cultural appropriation himself, Chet once again impersonated a Jamaican accent at the Golden Globes this year, after a video went viral of him speaking Patois and laughing, as he said he didn't want a 'mawga' girl, meaning 'skinny.'  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Adele - who split with her husband Simon Konecki last year - has been romantically linked to Grime artist Skepta, 37, but is thought to be currently single.</p>

<p>Many have criticized the Grammy-winning songstress for her Notting Hill Carnival post, which was taken at her $9.5million Beverly Hills home on Sunday. </p>

<p>However, others pointed out that she grew up in Tottenham, London and has been surrounded by Black culture throughout her life.</p>

<p>MP David Lammy, tweeted in response to a critical article: 'Poppycock! This humbug totally misses the spirit of Notting Hill Carnival and the tradition of "dress up" or "'masquerade".' </p>

<p>'Adele was born and raised in Tottenham she gets it more than most. Thank you Adele. Forget the Haters.'</p>

<p>But the same cannot be said the privileged Chet, who goes by his rapper name Chet Haze.  </p>

<p>In 2015, Chet defended his use of the N-word on social media, saying he believes it 'unifies the culture of hip-hop across all races.' </p>

<p>In an Instagram post, he said: 'I do say the n word in real life amongst my black friends who get me and can't nobody tell me I can't say what the [expletive] I feel like no disrespect to the struggle of black ppl during the civil rights movement but it’s 2015 now.' He went on to encourage followers to 'get with the times.' </p>

<p>In February this year, Chet admitted that he now 'realises' his white privilege, following a debate about cultural appropriation online.</p>

<p>Cultural appropriation is a phrase to describe when members of a dominant culture use elements from a disadvantaged or minority culture for profit. </p>
