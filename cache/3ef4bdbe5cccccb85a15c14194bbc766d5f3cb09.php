<p>Confronting footage shows the moment a young woman was dragged from her car screaming while she attempted to pass through a coronavirus checkpoint in Melbourne</p>

<p>Ms Bonett screamed and resisted in the footage, demanding the officer stop touching her and get out of her car. </p>

<p>A passenger in the car attempted to hold her back, trying to tell the officer she's 'got anxiety' while Ms Bonett became increasingly hysterical.</p>

<p>The disturbing footage ended as Ms Bonett slipped off camera and appeared to be dragged from the car.</p>

<p>'What the f<strong>k are you doing, what the f</strong>k, get off me,' she shouted at the officer. </p>

<p>Moments earlier, the officer had given her an opportunity to state her name, and asked her several times to get out of the car.</p>

<p>'No, I don't feel safe. You're armed,' she responded.</p>

<p>The officer assured her she would be safe before eventually losing his patience and dragging her out himself.</p>

<p>Ms Bonett said she usually passes through the checkpoint with no issues, showing her license and permit to the officers on duty. </p>

<p>She later revealed on Facebook she filmed her entire 14 minute arrest. </p>

<p>'If you want to see the video.... you will all be disgusted. I am shaking, crying and in complete disbelief that I was treated this way.' </p>

<p>Ms Bonett claimed officers called for backup when she wouldn't leave her car and that a total of four police officers eventually dragged her out. </p>

<p>'They grabbed me by the legs and pulled me out of my car and arrested me,' she said.</p>

<p>'While trying to cuff me, they had their knees in my back and couldn't breathe.' </p>

<p>She said she would 'mention more' when she was in 'the right headspace'.  </p>
