<p>A teenager accused of releasing a sex tape of herself with a star footballer after he allegedly turned down her request for a threesome will plead guilty.  </p>

<p>McKenzie Lorraine Robinson, 18, appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Wednesday charged with distributing the illegal vision.</p>

<p>The teenager is accused of sharing footage of herself engaged in an intimate act with the star Brisbane Broncos centre between June 14 and August 5 without his consent.</p>

<p>When she last appeared in court, a lawyer for Ms Robinson - who now uses the alias McKenziana Skye on social media - vowed to explain how the sex tape was leaked at a later court appearance.</p>

<p>But on Wednesday, solicitor Chelsea Waters instead asked for an extra two weeks to prepare the case. </p>

<p>The court heard Ms Robinson can be expected to plead guilty to the charge. </p>

<p>Defence lawyer Jason Jacobson previously insisted the teenager never meant for the video to circulate on social media.  </p>

<p>Her defence lawyer, Jason Jacobson, previously insisted the teenager never meant for the video to circulate on social media</p>

<p>Despite the embarrassment for the up-and-coming Bronco, Staggs was cleared of any wrongdoing by the NRL's integrity unit after the video was released</p>

<p>'It was not Ms Robinson that made this private video go public,' he told reporters outside court at her last scheduled appearance.</p>

<p>'That was never intended by her and she very much regrets that it did and she very much regrets the impact that it caused for Mr Staggs.</p>

<p>'There is an explanation as to how this happened and that will be put to the court at a later date.' </p>

<p>Ms Robinson's matter is now scheduled to appear before the court again on October 16. </p>

<p>Despite the embarrassment for the up-and-coming Bronco, Staggs was cleared of any wrongdoing by the NRL's integrity unit after the video was released.  </p>

<p>Staggs' lawyer Dave Garratt previously said his client praised Queensland Police for their handling of the matter</p>

<p>Her defence lawyer, Jason Jacobson, previously insisted the teenager never meant for the video to circulate on social media</p>

<p>Ms Robinson, who has been the target of extensive trolling since video circulated, allegedly messaged the star footballer on Instagram and instigated the relationship.</p>

<p>Shortly after they began speaking online, the duo met up and slept together, and Robinson allegedly asked if she could film the sexual encounter.</p>

<p>She assured him she could be 'trusted', The Courier Mail previously reported.   </p>

<p>Staggs alleges Robinson, who describes herself as a 'holistic wellness coach,' repeatedly called and messaged him following their rendezvous. </p>

<p>Robinson has so far refused to publicly comment on the allegations </p>

<p>She allegedly also asked the NRL star if he would have a threesome with her and a friend, according to the publication.</p>

<p>Fed up with the alleged constant messages, Staggs reportedly asked the teen to stop contacting him just weeks before the video was released to the public.  </p>

<p>He made a complaint to police after the video surfaced, claiming it was released without his consent.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old has shared several scantily-clad photos of herself on social media, where she writes that she is 'dedicated to empowerment and love'. </p>

<p>'I am a (sic) empath and have a huge high energy connection to the universe through crystals, meditation, aromatherapy and oracle readings,' a post on her Instagram read.</p>

<p>Staggs' lawyer Dave Garratt previously told The Courier Mail his client praised Queensland Police for their handling of the matter.</p>

<p>'Mr Staggs is extremely embarrassed and disappointed that his private life has been brought into the public domain,' Mr Garratt said.</p>

<p>'It has caused embarrassment to him, his family and the club and he is hoping to put this behind him now and leave it with the authorities.'</p>

<p>Fed up with the alleged constant messaging, Staggs reportedly asked the teen to stop contacting him just weeks before the video was released to the public</p>

<p>Staggs was recently ruled out of the upcoming State of Origin match when he injured himself in the final game of the regular season</p>
