<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A windswept beach chalet which has a corrugated roof has gone on the market for a whopping £215,000.</p>

<p>The isolated wooden property has just 370 sq ft of living space with a reception room, a kitchenette, one bedroom and a shower room.</p>

<p>And if it feels a tad cramped inside, there is ample garden space to the front and side enclosed by post and rail fencing with parking space for three vehicles.  </p>

<p>This beach chalet of timber framed construction beneath a corrugated roof has gone on the market for a whopping £215,000 in Camber Sands, East Sussex</p>

<p>But its stunning location which is set back from the road behind the sea wall with ready access to the vast expanse of beach on the edge of Camber Sands, East Sussex, means it can command such a big asking price.</p>

<p>The 20ft by 19ft chalet named Outback is in an area called Jury's Gap, slightly away from the main beach which is considered the watersports capital of the south.</p>

<p>Jury's Gap beach is also known as Broomhill Sands. The beach is sandy with groynes and as the tide goes out you have a massive beach to play on. </p>

<p>The part glazed entrance door opens into a triple aspect open plan kitchen/dining/living room with matchboard panelled walls, a vaulted ceiling with exposed roof trusses</p>

<p>The single storey coastal style cottage of timber framed construction beneath a corrugated roof was refurbished by the current owners just three years ago.</p>

<p>Although it would make the ideal holiday home there is no restrictions on the property meaning it can be lived in 365 days a year.  </p>

<p>There is open farmland on one side and just a short walk across the road and over the sea wall is the beach on the other.</p>

<p>Outback is also close to Dungeness headland, one of the largest expanses of shingly beaches in Europe, and Rye Harbour Nature Reserve. </p>

<p>The kitchen area has been re-modelled in a 'retro 1960's style' with Daintymaid wall and base cabinets, granite-effect working surfaces, single bowl, double drainer stainless steel sink, inset electric hob and built-in oven, washing machine and fridge</p>

<p>Jason Stubbs, from agents Phillips &amp; Stubbs, who are selling the property, said: 'Something like this is the perfect second home or holiday let. </p>

<p>'It's the ideal getaway from the city. A lot of people come on the train from London.</p>

<p>'That little area is known as Jury's Gap and this was part of a little row of coastguard cottages. It's a little way away from the crowds. </p>

<p>The light and airy double bedroom has a raised ceiling, wooden floors and just enough space for a double bed and a wardrobe for beachwear clothes</p>

<p>The shower room has matchboard panelled walls and a white suite with corner shower enclosure, wash basin with vanity unit and a close coupled WC</p>

<p>'Camber Sands itself gets really busy but Jury's Gap is much quieter, you genuinely have most of the beach to yourself. </p>

<p>'You can't quite see the beach from the property because of the sea wall, but you just walk across the road and you're on the beach and you've got the whole stretch of Camber Sands.</p>

<p>'That particular stretch of the beach is really popular with kite surfers - it has perfect conditions. There's shallow water and there's always an offshore wind. </p>

<p>This is one of the best known area on the South Coast,where a variety of activities can be enjoyed including kite wind surfing, surfing, land yachting, horse riding, fishing as well as numerous other activities</p>

<p>'Coastal living is hugely popular and the interest in staycations has definitely gone up given the current circumstances.</p>

<p>'The price of something like Outback has probably tripled in the last decade.</p>

<p>'You get the best of both worlds there - coastal life but with the protection of the sea wall.' </p>

<p>The chalet is located in Jury's Gap, an area which is considered to be the watersports capital of the south. Wind surfers swear by the perfect conditions here </p>

<p>This Chain free property is situated in an deal location in East Sussex for water sports enthusiasts. It will make for a perfect holiday home or investment opportunity</p>
