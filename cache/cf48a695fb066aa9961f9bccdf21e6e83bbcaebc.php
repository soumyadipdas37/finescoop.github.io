<p>Bethenny has been enjoying a lavish quarantine period with daughter Bryn, whom she shares with ex Jason Hoppy, 49, and her film producer boyfriend Paul Bernon.</p>

<p>Bethenny and her crew have been avoiding the stagnancy of lockdown by moving between all three of her properties in Manhattan, the Hamptons, and a newly acquired home in Boston. </p>

<p>On Monday, the Frankel uploaded an unfiltered selfie to her Instagram in order to stress the importance of posting more 'realistic' images of women on social media.</p>

<p>Switch up: She replaced her straw hat with a cowboy hat and slipped into a teal maxi dress</p>

<p>'The more I see photos on social media that are filtered, contoured, eyelashed, extensioned, &amp; retouched - the more important it is to post #nofilter, real, everyday photos,' captioned the reality star.</p>

<p>She added: 'I want to show our daughters (and sons) a realistic female image,' adding the hashtags: 'THISiswhatilooklike #thisisme #unfilteredselfie #noglam #workingmom.'</p>

<p>Bethenny's stunning self-portrait came just one day after she revealed that, at Bryn's request, she would be returning to a vegetarian diet. </p>

<p>Unfiltered: On Monday, the Frankel uploaded an unfiltered selfie to her Instagram in order to stress the importance of posting more 'realistic' images of women on social media</p>

<p>Setting the example: 'I want to show our daughters (and sons) a realistic female image,' adding the hashtags: 'THISiswhatilooklike #thisisme #unfilteredselfie #noglam #workingmom,' she wrote; Bethenny and Bryn pictured on Monday</p>

<p>'Bryn wants to be a vegetarian cause she loves animals, so she's asked me to do it with her,' explained Frankel, who shared images of some of the ethical dishes she whipped up to her Instagram Story.</p>

<p>She added: 'I used to eat this way, so let's see how it goes.'</p>

<p>A vegetarian diet is completely free of meat consumption and, often times, the consumption of by-products resulting from animal slaughter. </p>

<p>One of the meat-free entrees Bethenny prepared on Sunday was a delicious looking cauliflower crust pizza with 'vegan mozzarella [she] shredded and marinara.'</p>

<p>Vegetarian: Bethenny's stunning self-portrait came just one day after she revealed that, at Bryn's request, she would be returning to a vegetarian diet; Bethenny and Bryn pictured in August</p>

<p>The successful entrepreneur noted that 'the key' to making the cauliflower crust as delectable as possible is by '[using] a pizza stone and crisp[ing] both sides of crust on high heat before adding toppings.' </p>

<p>Removing meat, including seafood, may prove beneficial for Bethenny, being that she suffers from a 'rare fish allergy.'</p>

<p>Back in 2018, the reality star's allergy became public knowledge, when she experienced a near fatal reaction after consuming a bowl of fish soup at a restaurant.</p>
