<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Marcus Rashford was at his dazzling best on Saturday, scoring a solo stunner in Manchester United's dramatic victory over Brighton. </p>

<p>The Englishman has been earning plaudits off the pitch all summer but in United's second game of the 2020-21 season the 22-year-old is reminding everyone of his incredible ability. </p>

<p>Rashford ran on to a glorious Bruno Fernandes pass in the 54th minute, which was where the influence of his team-mates ended. He twisted Ben White into a heap, cut inside, chopped back once more and smashed into the net for 2-1.  </p>

<p>Marcus Rashford scored a glorious solo goal for Manchester United against Brighton </p>

<p>The forward turned Brighton's defence inside-out, dribbling through in the 54th minute </p>

<p>The striker then rifled into the net, getting his scoring tally underway for the 2020-21 season</p>

<p>The forward made a huge step up last season, firing in 17 goals in 31 top-flight games and contributing eight assists. He'll be looking to back that up this season.  </p>

<p>Much of the praise directed at Rashford on social media had reference to the youngster's off-field work, having continued to be a force for good since lockdown after successfully lobbying the Government to continue their free school meals scheme.  </p>

<p>Pogba Senior joked on Twitter: 'Rashford will end a defender's career so they can't feed their kids and then he'll go by himself and feed their kids.' </p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes assisted the forward, before scoring the winning penalty for Man United </p>

<p>'Marcus Rashford, dropping school meals on a Friday night to dropping Ben White on a Saturday afternoon,' <?php echo e('@'); ?>ManUnitedMedia added. </p>

<p>Keeping focused on the football, <?php echo e('@'); ?>Donatog87 said: 'Marcus Rashford take a bow! Great goal. Incredible composure on the play.' </p>

<p>The Old Trafford side ran out 3-2 winners at the final whistle after Bruno Fernandes' controversial 100th minute penalty, ending an enthralling game as United bounced-back from their dour opening day defeat to Crystal Palace. </p>
