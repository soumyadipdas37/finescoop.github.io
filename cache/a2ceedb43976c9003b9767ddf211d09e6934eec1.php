<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Last night's MTV Video Music Awards red carpet looked a little different compared to past years. </p>

<p>Socially distanced, performers including Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus and Doja Cat posed for photographers outside arenas across NYC's five boroughs and LA.</p>

<p>And despite the COVID-19 pandemic, it was a parade of daring fashions and bling! FEMAIL highlights the jewelry worth taking a closer look at. </p>

<p>Meaningful jewelry: Lady Gaga accessorized her look with a dainty custom necklace by Edward Avedis. The diamond pendant represents the logo of her latest album, Chromatica, and was designed by jeweler Avedis Guerboian</p>

<p>Symbolism: 'It's the mathematical symbol of sound, created in 14K rose gold and diamonds. The design was made to commemorate her new album,' said Edward Avedis designer Avedis Guerboian</p>

<p>You can count on Lady Gaga to make an entrance, and she certainly did so at last night's VMAS!</p>

<p>Area was founded in New York by designers Beckett Fogg and Piotrek Panszczyk. In recent years, it's amassed an impressive celebrity fanbase including J-Lo, Kylie Jenner, Charli XCX and Hailey Bieber (to name just a few).</p>

<p>Lady Gaga, 34, didn't let a pandemic stop her from bringing her fashion A-game. </p>

<p>Over the course of the evening, the 11-time Grammy winner wore nine different showstopping outfits, all of which were made complete with protective face coverings. </p>

<p>On the carpet she stood tall channeling her inner VMA Moon Man in a textured silver jacket by Area, a clear helmet by Muscarella, and platform boots by Pleasers.</p>

<p>The Born This Way singer accessorized the unique look with a dainty custom necklace by Edward Avedis.  </p>

<p>The delicate bauble is no ordinary necklace. The diamond pendant represents the logo of her latest album, Chromatica, and was designed by jeweler Avedis Guerboian.</p>

<p>'The Diamond Chromatica Sine symbol was designed for Lady Gaga,' said Avedis.</p>

<p>'It's the mathematical symbol of sound, created in 14K rose gold and diamonds. The design was made to commemorate her new album.' </p>

<p>Avedis was originally commissioned by one of Gaga's friends to create a solid gold pendant for the singer as a gift. He designed the pendant requested and an additional one encrusted with diamonds for the superstar.  </p>
