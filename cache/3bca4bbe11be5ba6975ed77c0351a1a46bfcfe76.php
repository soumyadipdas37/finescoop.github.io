<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor has faced heavy criticism for its lack of contestant diversity.</p>

<p>But host Chris Harrison insists the franchise has been proactive about overcoming this issue for some time.   </p>

<p>Harrison, 49, spoke with E! about how the show dealt with the problem, which included making changes from within.</p>

<p>'This is a movement': Chris Harrison insists The Bachelor franchise has been working to increase diversity for some time (pictured 2018)</p>

<p>This year marked a major shift for the franchise, which cast it's very first Black Bachelor in its 18-year history, Matt James.  </p>

<p>Initially, James was cast for Clare Crawley's season of The Bachelorette, but was elevated to leading man status before filming ever began.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, Bachelors and Bachelorettes are selected from past seasons, but James ended up being announced as the next male lead without ever officially being on the show.   </p>

<p>The timing of the Bachelor announcement coincided with the recent racial reckoning the nation had been facing these last few months.  </p>

<p>Will you accept this rose? This year marked a major shift for the franchise, which cast it's very first Black Bachelor in its 18-year history, Matt James</p>

<p>For fans, the changes may seem sudden, but Harrison insists that isn't the case.   </p>

<p>'I think it's important to state that it didn't just start with Clare's season,' Harrison said of Crawley's contestants, which are more diverse than past seasons. 'This is a movement and something we've been working on for quite some time. Step one was realizing there was an issue. And then step two is, OK, let's do something about that.'</p>

<p>Many of the changes were done from within, meaning fans have not always been privy to the strides the series had been making.  </p>

<p>'You're not gonna see some changes because it's behind the camera, with our hiring practices, with people we brought in, people we promoted within our show,' he explained. 'And clearly you saw it with the announcement of Matt James. And you're gonna see it with the casting in the women. But the idea is people want to be represented.</p>

<p>Familiar face: Bachelor vet Clare Crawley will be looking for love on TV this fall </p>

<p>'They want to see themselves represented. And The Bachelor and The Bachelorette is a love story and you want to see your love story told.' </p>

<p>Harrison had nothing but kind things to say about James, who was no stranger to many members of Bachelor Nation when he was initially cast on Clare's season. </p>

<p>James is friends with fan favorites Hannah Brown and Tyler Cameron, and even quarantined with them this last year in Florida.</p>

<p>Bachelor Nation! Fans may already know James as a friend of Bachelorette vet Tyler Cameron</p>

<p>'I've talked a lot about him with Tyler C. and he's a genuine, good man. He's the kind of guy you want as The Bachelor,' Harrison said. </p>

<p>'He's the kind of guy that I think women will be fortunate to fall in love with.'</p>

<p>Fans will have to wait to watch James fall in love, with filming on his season only recently beginning.  </p>

<p>But it won't be much longer until Bachelor Nation will be back in full force with the return of The Bachelorette, which will premiere October 13. </p>
