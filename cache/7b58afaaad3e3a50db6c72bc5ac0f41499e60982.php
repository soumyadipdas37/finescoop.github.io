<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>'No-one grows up and wants to be a Gary Neville,' said Jamie Carragher in 2013.</p>

<p>The former Liverpool defender claimed right backs were either failed wingers or centre backs - but fast-forward seven years and England are blessed with an array of talent in that position.</p>

<p>Chelsea's Reece James and Brighton's Tariq Lamptey starred during Monday night's clash at the Amex and are just two of the options at Gareth Southgate's disposal. </p>

<p>Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher once joked no one grows up and wants to be a Gary Neville</p>

<p>Neville joked the former Liverpool man's jibe sparked a 'phenomenon' for England at right back</p>

<p>Pointing back to his fellow Sky Sports pundit's historic jibe, Neville joked: 'He (Carragher) once said that no-one wants to grow up to be a Gary Neville! There is a lot of them, he's started a phenomenon!'</p>

<p>Of the 16 players who started at right back in the Premier League fixtures last weekend, nine were English - and that doesn't include Manchester City's Kyle Walker and Manchester United's Aaron Wan-Bissaka. As Gary Lineker joked, if England could only play right backs at international level - they might just win something.</p>

<p>With Southgate set for a selection headache ahead of next summer's Euros, Sportsmail takes a look at the players who could make the Three Lions' squad.  </p>

<p> Kyle Walker-Peters (Southampton)  </p>

<p>The right back worked his way up through the Tottenham academy before making his debut in 2017. </p>

<p>Despite a promising start, he failed to nail down a regular place in the first-team but an impressive loan spell with Southampton last season led to a permanent move this summer. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old, who has represented England at Under 21 level, still has a lot of potential. As Neville highlighted on Monday Night Football, expectations of the modern day full backs are to deliver assists and goals in addition to defending well.</p>

<p>Walker-Peters' last assist came in December 2018 and he will have to improve the attacking side of his game in order to get closer to Southgate's squad. </p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 4/10 </p>

<p>Kyle Walker-Peters completed a permanent move to Southampton after impressing on loan</p>

<p>Joel Ward (Crystal Palace)</p>

<p>A reliable figure in the Crystal Palace defence, Ward joined the Eagles in 2012 and has gone on to make 200 Premier League appearances, with his latest coming against Southampton last weekend.</p>

<p>Perhaps an example of Carragher's previous theory, Ward started his professional career as a defensive midfielder and also played centre back before filling in at both right and left back for Palace.</p>

<p>Ward has never been capped for England at any level - and at the age of 30, that's unlikely to change.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 2/10  </p>

<p>Joel Ward has been a reliable figure for Crystal Palace and can operate in a number of positions</p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold (Liverpool)</p>

<p>Hailed as one of the best players in the world by Neville on Monday night, Alexander-Arnold is virtually guaranteed a place in England's Euros squad - providing he stays fit.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old, already a Premier League and Champions League winner, has twice broken the record for top flight assists for a defender with 12 in the 2018-2019 season and 13 in the last campaign.</p>

<p>There have been suggestions he could be moved into midfield because of his creativity, which would free up the right back position for one of England's many options. </p>

<p>With age very much on his side, perhaps the most exciting thing about the Liverpool man is the improvements, particularly defensively, that he can still make to his game.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 9.5/10  </p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold has twice broken the record for Premier League assists for a defender</p>

<p>Luke Ayling (Leeds)</p>

<p>Last season's Championship PFA Player of the Year winner, Ayling has become a firm fan favourite at Elland Road since joining the club in 2016.</p>

<p>After leaving Arsenal without making a senior appearance, this is the defender's first season in the Premier League after helping the Yorkshire club achieve promotion in July. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old's priority this year will be making sure Leeds maintain their top flight status after making a promising start against Liverpool, despite falling to a 4-3 defeat.</p>

<p>Luke Ayling has become a firm fan favourite at Elland Road after joining the club in 2016</p>

<p>Ryan Fredericks (West Ham)</p>

<p>The full back signed for the Hammers in 2018 but has had a hit and miss two years in East London.</p>

<p>Now David Moyes' first choice right back, the defender has licence to get forward but can sometimes be left exposed defensively - as was the case against Newcastle on Saturday.</p>

<p>Surprisingly the 27-year-old topped the charts for chances created in this weekend's fixtures with five, the same number as Everton's James Rodriguez. The Hammers will be hoping he can create more chances in the difficult run of fixtures they have coming up.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 3/10  </p>

<p>Ryan Fredericks has licence to get forward under David Moyes but must improve defensively</p>

<p>Darnell Furlong (West Brom)</p>

<p>The 24-year-old made his Premier League debut in the Baggies' 3-0 defeat by Leicester on the opening day - and he's likely to have plenty of defending to do this season.</p>

<p>Slaven Bilic's side are one of the favourites for the drop and Furlong will be kept busy by opposition wingers.</p>

<p>But the former QPR defender also likes to get forward and will hope to create chances for frontmen Charlie Austin and Callum Robinson.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 2/10  </p>

<p>Darnell Furlong made his Premier League debut for West Brom in the 3-0 defeat by Leicester</p>

<p>George Baldock (Sheffield United)</p>

<p>After a string of loan spells at lower league clubs, Baldock finally earned a permanent move from MK Dons to Sheffield United in 2017 and has not looked back.</p>

<p>The defender played a key role in the club's promotion to the Premier League in 2019 and also helped secure an impressive ninth place finish last season.</p>

<p>Operating mainly as a right wing-back, the 27-year-old made four assists and grabbed two goals in the previous campaign. The Blades started the new season with a 2-0 home defeat to Wolves but will be hoping to bounce back against Aston Villa next weekend.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 3/10  </p>

<p>George Baldock has not looked back since he completed a move to Sheffield United in 2017</p>

<p>Reece James (Chelsea)</p>

<p>The 20-year-old's first Premier League goal was certainly worth the wait with the defender producing a stunning strike to help Chelsea beat Brighton on Monday.</p>

<p>James made 24 appearances for the Blues last season with the experienced Cesar Azpilicueta sometimes switching to play left back or centre back.</p>

<p>With Ben Chilwell likely to be the regular on the opposite flank this season, James will be battling it out with the Spaniard for the right back spot.  </p>

<p>Kyle Walker, 30, and Kieran Trippier, 29, are perhaps coming towards the end of their international careers meaning James can stake a claim for England in the future - but he may need Alexander-Arnold to be moved into midfield.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 7/10  </p>

<p>Reece James scored a stunning strike and grabbed an assist as Chelsea beat Brighton</p>

<p>Tariq Lamptey (Brighton)</p>

<p>The 19-year-old made the bold decision to leave Stamford Bridge in January in search of regular football - something he has found at Brighton.</p>

<p>The youngster has made an impressive start to life on the south coast and was one of the standout performers in the match against his former club on Monday. </p>

<p>Lamptey earned praise from Neville and Carragher as well as his manager Graham Potter, who described his approach to football as 'refreshing'.</p>

<p>Like Alexander-Arnold and James, he has a lot of time to develop further and will be hoping to force his way into the senior Three Lions squad in the near future.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 6.5/10  </p>

<p>Tariq Lamptey was a standout performer during the clash with his former side on Monday</p>

<p>DON'T FORGET... </p>

<p>Kyle Walker (Manchester City)  </p>

<p>The most experienced of England's right-backs, Walker has won seven trophies in three years with Pep Guardiola's side and knows what it takes to play at the top.</p>

<p>The defender was utilised in a back three at the World Cup with Trippier taking up the right-wing back role.  </p>

<p>He now has more competition at international level than he did a few years ago and will know he must have a good season to ensure his spot in the Euros squad next summer.</p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 9/10  </p>

<p>Kyle Walker is the most experienced of the right back options available to Gareth Southgate</p>

<p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka (Manchester United)</p>

<p>After his breakout season for Crystal Palace in the 2018-2019 campaign, the right back sealed a £50million move to Old Trafford.</p>

<p>There were plenty of positives to take from his first season at United but he will know there is room for improvement. </p>

<p>The 22-year-old will want to add more to the attacking side of his game in terms of assists and goals if he is to rival the other English full backs. </p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 6.5/10  </p>

<p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka will want to add to the attacking side of his game in order to rival others</p>

<p>Kieran Trippier (Atletico Madrid)</p>

<p>One of England's stars at the 2018 World Cup, Trippier is now playing his football in LaLiga after leaving Tottenham last summer.</p>

<p>The full back's quality from set pieces makes him a valuable asset for the Three Lions and he showed versatility by playing left back in the two Nations League games earlier this month.</p>

<p>He's a player that Southgate clearly trusts but will know he has to perform well this season to guarantee a place at the Euros. </p>

<p>CHANCES OF EARNING A CALL UP: 9/10  </p>

<p>Kieran Trippier was one of the stars at the 2018 World Cup and has quality from set pieces</p>

<p>Matty Cash (Aston Villa)</p>

<p>Aston Villa splashed £16m to sign the 23-year-old from Nottingham Forest earlier this month after impressing in the Championship.</p>

<p>Cash provided three goals and five assists as Forest just missed out on a place in the play-offs last season. </p>

<p>Once linked with a move to Chelsea, the defender has finally got his chance in the Premier League and will want to make a quick impression at Villa Park.</p>

<p>Aston Villa splashed £16m on Matty Cash after the defender impressed in the Championship</p>

<p>Matthew Lowton</p>

<p>Neither Lowton or Phil Bardsley managed to secure Burnley's right back spot on a regular basis last season with the pair interchanging throughout the campaign.</p>

<p>Lowton, 31, is set for his sixth season with the Clarets but could be in for another year of rotation. </p>
