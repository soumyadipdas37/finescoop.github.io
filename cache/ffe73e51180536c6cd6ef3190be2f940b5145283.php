<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are looking to sell Jesse Lingard and Andreas Pereira as they look to clear up space at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>It comes as the Red Devils close in on the signing of Ajax star Donny van de Beek who is set to complete a £40m deal to join the club.</p>

<p>The Dutch midfielder who would be Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first signing of the summer, is understood to have agreed personal terms over a five-year deal at United.</p>

<p>Jesse Lingard's 20-year partnership with Manchester United could be ending this summer</p>

<p>It comes as United look to make room for Ajax star Donny van de Beek who is set to join</p>

<p>Solskjaer is also hoping to bring in further recruits including a centre-half, someone for the right-wing and another forward before the transfer window closes on October 5.</p>

<p>And as Solskjaer looks to make room, it is no surprise that both Lingard and Pereira are expected to leave, as they have fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford and deemed surplus to requirements.</p>

<p>United are well covered in the middle of the park with Van de Beek potentially joining Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, Fred, Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata for places. </p>

<p>Andreas Pereira could also be on his way out as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to clear space</p>

<p>Last season was a tough campaign for Lingard, who has had to balance off-field issues with trying to win his place back in a flourishing team.</p>

<p>And both the 27-year-old and Pereira have been on the fringes of the first team since the emergence of Mason Greenwood and impressive form of January signing Fernandes.</p>

<p>It would end Lingard's 20-year partnership with United having joined the club when he was just seven, but the Englishman has not started a Premier League game for the club since New Years' Day.</p>

<p>Pereira joined the club in 2011 at the age of 15 but has not started for the club since a 1-1 draw with Club Brugge in the Europa League back in February.</p>
