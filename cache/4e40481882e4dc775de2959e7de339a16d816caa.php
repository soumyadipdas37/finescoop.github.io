<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Atalanta have entered negotiations with Chelsea to sign Davide Zappacosta on loan for next season, according to reports.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has fallen out of favour in west London and the club are actively attempting to ship him out again in the current window.</p>

<p>Sky Sport Italia report that Atalanta are keen to re-sign Zappacosta, albeit for a short-term stint, as they continue to search for a new right back. </p>

<p>Atalanta have entered talks with Chelsea to sign Davide Zappacosta on loan for next season</p>

<p>After their chase for Roma's Rick Karsdorp fell through, reportedly due to issues with his agent's demands over commissions, Atalanta have turned to their former player and will attempt to thrash out a deal. </p>

<p>Zappacosta represented the Bergamo outfit between 2011 and 2015 before moving to Torino - and it was from there that he completed his swoop to Chelsea.</p>

<p>The full back has struggled with limited playing time and has also been rocked by a host of injuries.</p>

<p>Chelsea are believed to be keen to be seeking a permanent solution for Zappacosta, whose current deal runs down in 2022, during the current market.</p>

<p>Zappacosta has struggled with playing time and injuries since moving to Chelsea in 2017</p>

<p>The 28-year-old spent last season with Roma but torn his anterior cruciate ligament in October</p>

<p>His torn anterior cruciate ligament injury last October while on loan at Roma prevented him from being able to impress, and just seven top flight appearances then followed. </p>

<p>Zappacosta's loan had initially been until January, but both parties agreed an extension until the end of the elongated season. </p>

<p>And it appears increasingly unlikely there is any way back for the Italian at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard has overhauled his team with a sensational spending spree this summer, although both captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Reece James will remain his first choices on the right side of defence. </p>
