<p>Flawless: Georgia Fowler showed off her flawless figure in an orange bikini in Byron Bay on Tuesday </p>

<p>Georgia was slightly sunburned on her backside, but the rest of her body had a golden tan.</p>

<p>She was accompanied by her boyfriend, Nathan Dallah, who was carrying a surfboard.</p>

<p>In an interview with Mamamia this week, Georgia revealed the secrets behind her flawless skin.</p>

<p>A minor adjustment! The 28-year-old adjusted her bikini bottoms for a brief moment </p>

<p>Red hot: Georgia was slightly sunburned on her backside, but the rest of her body had a golden tan</p>

<p>'Growing up I didn't do much, you know I was brought up in New Zealand, and my mum was very no fuss and only used one moisturiser,' she said. </p>

<p>'I learnt, obviously being in the modelling industry and having makeup artist and professionals working on my skin all day and every day, what products I should use...'</p>

<p>The New Zealand beauty said that she credits her skin to a number of beauty products from cleansers to sunscreen.</p>

<p>Looking good: Georgia was accompanied by her boyfriend, Nathan Dallah, who was carrying a surfboard</p>

<p>All done? The supermodel walked towards her towel after enjoying a dip in the ocean </p>

<p>Time to go! Georgia gathered her things from the sand as she prepared to leave the beach</p>

<p>Helping hand: The Kiwi stunner wrapped her large pink towel around her beau</p>

<p>Wrapped up: Georgia playfully wrapped her towel around Nathan to dry him off</p>

<p>Georgia's favourite cleanser is the Royal Fern Cleansing Balm which retails for $114 as it 'gives a nice cleanse without drying out your skin too much'.</p>

<p>She also said that she uses an exfoliant everyday, to help with 'blackheads and any impurities'.</p>

<p>When it comes to her favourite serum, the model revealed that her sister turned her onto the $148 Emma Lewishan Skin Reset serum which helps in 'getting rid of any pigmentation'.</p>

<p>All smiles: Nathan giggled and laughed as Georgia sat below him in the sand </p>

<p>Getting dressed: Georgia pulled up her outfit so she could cover up her bikini </p>

<p>Georgia also credits the importance of massaging face oils in to your skin to help reduce puffiness.</p>

<p>'It really does helps bring all the blood to the face and gets rid of any excess fluid that's sitting around or puffy eyes and it's a really good practice,' she added.</p>

<p>And, of course, sunscreen is a must with the model using two different types, including Dermalogica tinted sunscreen and the Rationale Beautiful Skin Superfluid.</p>

<p>Almost done! The model finished putting on her outfit before gathering the last of her things and leaving</p>
