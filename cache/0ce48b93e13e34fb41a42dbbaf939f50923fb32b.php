<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich icon Lothar Matthaus has taken a swipe at Pep Guardiola after his failure to win the Champions League since leaving Barcelona and labelled him as 'egocentric' for making too many changes.</p>

<p>The Manchester City boss saw his side dumped out by Lyon in the quarter-finals last season, with the Ligue 1 side running out 3-1 winners, and the Spaniard has still failed to reach the last four since he arrived at the club. </p>

<p>Guardiola also struggled in the competition with Bayern and has received criticism for his decision-making in recent seasons. In City's defeat against the French outfit he surprised many by opting to play three at the back.</p>

<p>Manchester boss Pep Guardiola has been slammed for his recent Champions League failures </p>

<p>Bayern icon Lothar Matthaus called him 'egocentric' for tinkering with his team in big games</p>

<p>Now Matthaus has accused him of trying too hard to 'do something special' and said he must show more consistency in his tactics if he is to end his hoo-doo and win Europe's grand prize. </p>

<p>'With Pep Guardiola I have the feeling that he always wants to do something special in big games,' he told German outlet BILD.</p>

<p>'Barcelona had a DNA, a system he pulled through. Pep was successful there.</p>

<p>'With Bayern and City, he tried it over and over again with changes and failed again and again.'</p>

<p>The Spaniard has seen his City side fall at the quarter-final stage for three successive years </p>

<p>Guardiola reached three semi-finals in a row with Bayern Munich, and suffered an embarrassing 5-0 loss on aggregate to Real Madrid in 2014, and Matthaus said Guardiola's constant need to tinker was 'egocentric' - pointing out his bizarre call to play Robert Lewandowski on the wing.   </p>

<p>'He always wanted to show that he could do even better. I would like to tell him: "Pep, you are a giant trainer - but please keep your system!"</p>

<p>'I would describe it as egocentric. That's a harsh word, but it is due to what he did.</p>

<p>He surprised many with his decision to play three at the back in their 3-1 defeat to Lyon </p>

<p>Matthaus urged Guardiola to keep his system after suffering years of heartbreak in Europe </p>

<p>'At Bayern, Robert Lewandowski even had to play left-wing once. That did not work out at all.'</p>

<p>Guardiola is one of a few managers to have won the Champions League twice - both with Barcelona - but has strayed away from the successful set-up he used at the Nou Camp. City's exit to Lyon was the third year in a row they have fallen in the last eight. </p>

<p>In 2018 they were dumped out by Premier League rivals Liverpool as they lost 5-1 on aggregate before a crushing last gasp loss to Tottenham the following year.  </p>
