<p>Out and about: Chloe Sevigny, 45, stepped out in her native New York City on Wednesday with her baby son, Vanja</p>

<p>Sevigny, who welcomed her first child this past May 2 with boyfriend Sinisa Mackovic, told WSJ. Magazine's September issue how she's adapted routines in becoming a mom.</p>

<p>'I'm usually really good at time management,' said the actress, who's been seen in the indie classics Kids and Gummo. 'I'm actually really proud of how I get everything done in a day.</p>

<p>'I keep lists, and I'm very organized. Since I've had the baby, I'm just like, I don't know how anybody gets anything done. I have to cook for everyone, then clean, then feed him, then clean him.'</p>

<p>She said that Mackovic and her mother have also been key in helping tend to the newborn child.</p>

<p>'We're lucky we have my mother coming and helping us a few times a week for a few hours. We've been lucky that Sinisa's been home from work, and he helps all the time,' Sevigny said. 'He's on Zoom calls 24 hours a day, half of them holding the baby.'</p>

<p>In the interview, Sevigny said that appearing on the HBO We Are Who We Are helped her become comfortable with the idea of having a son, as she plays an Army mom to a son named Jack on the series.</p>

<p>'I'd always secretly desired a girl,' she said. 'I guess that's not a secret if I'm talking about it to WSJ. But I'm very girl-power, girl-friendly, girl-centric. </p>

<p>'I don't even have that many male friends unless I'd slept with them or whatever. But on set I kept thinking, "What if I have a kid like this kid Jack?" First of all, he's brilliant, so that would be great; but secondly, he has so much energy.'</p>

<p>She added, 'It was a lot of meditating on that one.'</p>
