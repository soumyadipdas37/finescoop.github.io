<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The federal government could consider slapping Facebook and Google with a new tax if they refuse to pay Australian media companies for their content, an economist has said.</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg wants the tech giants to pay news organisations whose content they host and has released a code to guide negotiations.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday Facebook threatened to block Australian users from sharing news if it is forced to pay local publishers.</p>

<p>Allan Fels, former chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, said the government could bring Facebook and Google into line by threatening a digital transactions tax which could cost the companies millions.</p>

<p>'The government and the ACCC have anticipated [their refusal] and drawn up draft legislation that'll be harder to avoid,' he told the AFR.</p>

<p>'And also they've got a very big stick in the cupboard. They could drop the code and just apply a tax – a general tax on digital transactions. And the platforms have far more to lose from that.'</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has not commented on the idea of a digital transactions tax but on Tuesday he slammed Facebook's threats. </p>

<p>'Australia makes laws that advance our national interest. We don't respond to coercion or heavy handed threats wherever they come from,' he said. </p>

<p>Facebook executive Will Easton said the Australian government falsely assumed social media giants benefited most from their relationships with news organisations.</p>

<p>'Assuming this draft code becomes law, we will reluctantly stop allowing publishers and people in Australia from sharing local and international news on Facebook and Instagram,' he said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'This is not our first choice - it is our last.</p>

<p>'But it is the only way to protect against an outcome that defies logic and will hurt, not help, the long-term vibrancy of Australia's news and media sector.'</p>

<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, which is taking the lead on the proposed media code, described Facebook's threats as ill-timed and misconceived.</p>

<p>ACCC chairman Rod Sims pointed out Facebook already paid for some news content and said the code would ensure smaller media players could get a seat at the negotiating table.</p>

<p>'The code simply aims to bring fairness and transparency to Facebook and Google's relationships with Australian news media businesses,' he said.</p>

<p>A recent study found almost 40 per cent of Australians rely on Facebook for general news and nearly half use the platform for coronavirus news.</p>

<p>Google has previously warned it could be forced to offer Australian users 'dramatically worse' Google Search and YouTube products if the media bargaining laws are imposed.</p>

<p>The internet search giant also claims it may be required to share user data with Australian news businesses.</p>

<p>The ACCC has rubbished both claims.</p>

<p>Mr Easton said Facebook backed the Australian government's goal of supporting struggling news organisations. However, he said its solution was counterproductive.</p>

<p>The code seeks to address the fundamental bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and major digital platforms.</p>

<p>This imbalance has resulted in news media businesses accepting less favourable terms for the inclusion of news on digital platform services than they would otherwise agree to.</p>

<p>The draft code would allow news media businesses to bargain individually or collectively with Google and Facebook over payment for the inclusion of news on their services.</p>

<p>The code also includes a set of 'minimum standards' for:</p>

<p>Facebook sent Australian news websites 2.3 billion free 'clicks' in the first five months of the year, driving traffic worth an estimated $200 million.</p>

<p>Mr Easton said the company has invested million of dollars in Australian news and offered to spend even more, while also proposing a dedicated platform for local content.</p>

<p>'But these proposals were overlooked,' he said.</p>

<p>'Instead, we are left with a choice of either removing news entirely or accepting a system that lets publishers charge us for as much content as they want at a price with no clear limits.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, no business can operate that way.'</p>

<p>Labor communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland urged the coalition to land a workable code.</p>

<p>'The range of concerns held by all stakeholders demands a credible response from the government,' she said.</p>
