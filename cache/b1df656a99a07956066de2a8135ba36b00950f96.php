<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Timo Werner believes his decision to join Chelsea over Liverpool this summer was justified due to his new club having proved a 'better fit'.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old opted for a move to west London over Anfield, with Chelsea wrapping up a £53million move from RB Leipzig, and was also highly coveted by a number of other elite clubs across Europe.</p>

<p>Despite Liverpool having initially been labelled as favourites to sign him, Werner believes that the package on offer at Stamford Bridge proved a more attractive proposition for him.    </p>

<p>Timo Werner revealed he chose to join Chelsea over Liverpool due to them being a 'better fit'</p>

<p>Reports have suggested that Liverpool were unable to seal the deal due to Werner's price tag, but the Germany international has claimed that Chelsea were always his preferred choice.</p>

<p>He told The Athletic: 'In another world, it could have happened. If LFC call, you have to listen and think about it. They are one of the best teams on the world, with a super coach - a German coach to boot. Of course you think about that.</p>

<p>'But in the end, my decision went Chelsea's way. Not because there was anything wrong with Liverpool. But at Chelsea, the whole package was a better fit for me.'</p>

<p>Liverpool held a long-standing interest in Werner but were reportedly unable to meet his value</p>

<p>Frank Lampard was named as a key reason behind Kai Havertz's £89m switch to Chelsea this summer, and it appears that Werner was also similarly swayed after a lengthy conversation with the Blues boss. </p>

<p>The frontman has now revealed the nature of the decisive phone call with Lampard, with both having found common ground over their preferred style of play.</p>

<p>'He called me and we talked about his idea of football and his idea of how the way the team would look like,' he added. 'It all sounded good to me, especially the way he talked to me. It wasn't like, "I'm the coach and I want you. Please come!" He was very relaxed, asking me how I saw things, how I felt about playing here or there. </p>

<p>'And I was able to voice my opinion as well. He listened. In many aspects, we were in close agreement. He wants to play a pressing game, taking the game to the opposition, with quick transitions but to be good in possession as well.  </p>

<p>Werner explained how a phone call with Frank Lampard swayed him into signing for Chelsea</p>

<p>'He said, "Timo, you will be free to make the right moves on the pitch, I trust you." It was a very good conversation.' </p>

<p>Chelsea host Liverpool, their main rivals for Werner's signature, on Sunday after both teams recorded a winning start to the new season. </p>

<p>The clash has been billed by some as a chance for Werner to make the champions pay for their reluctance to meet his valuation in June, but the striker has played down any suggestions that will motivate him.  </p>

<p>He said: 'It would be wrong to approach the game that way. Showing the other team how good I am and what they're missing can't be the main motivation to perform. So it's not about that for me.'</p>
