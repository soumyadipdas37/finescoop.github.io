<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The coronavirus 'is not out of control' in Britain, Matt Hancock has claimed amid scientists warning the Government has lost its grip on spread of the disease. </p>

<p>Yesterday the UK recorded its highest number of daily Covid-19 cases since May after 2,988 were reported in just 24 hours.</p>

<p>The last time the UK's caseload was this high was May 23 - 15 weeks ago - when 2,959 people tested positive. </p>

<p>Scientists said it's beginning to look like the UK is 'moving into a period of exponential growth', and if that is the case, 'we can expect further increases over coming weeks'.</p>

<p>But Health Secretary Mr Hancock said cases were not out of control but the rise in cases was 'concerning' because 'nobody wants a second wave'.</p>

<p>He said most of the new cases were among the under 25s, while pleading with them to continue social distancing to avoid passing the virus onto their grandparents.  </p>

<p>Labour's shadow health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth called the figures 'deeply concerning and worrying' and suggests there is a real increase in the prevelane of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Scientists have previously said cases have risen over August as a result of increased testing in hotspots. But there are signs there is a real uptick in the number of people testing positive.</p>

<p>The UK recorded its highest number of daily Covid-19 cases since May after 2,988 were reported in just 24 hours</p>

<p>A further two people died after testing positive for the bug today, bringing the UK's total death toll to 41,551</p>

<p>Mr Hancock admitted yesterday the figures were 'concerning', and admitted that there had been real terms rise even after taking into account the increase in testing.</p>

<p>He also pleaded with 'predominantly' young people who make up the new cases toll to not pass the virus onto their grandparents for fear they could become seriously ill or die from it.</p>

<p>'The rise in the number of cases that we have seen today is concerning,' Mr Hancock told Sky News.</p>

<p>'The cases are predominantly among younger people but as we have seen in other countries across Europe, this sort of rise in cases amongst younger people leads to a rise across the population as a whole.</p>

<p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning, Mr Ashworth said: 'The big uptick we have seen in the figures yesterday is deeply concerning, it's deeply worrying. </p>

<p>'It's one days' worth of data so we will have to see what the trend is. But that days' worth of data is alarming, there is no question about it. It does suggest there is an increase in the virus.'</p>

<p>Mr Ashworth has called on Mr Hancock to go to parliament today to explain the testing 'fiasco' that has emerged in recent days.</p>

<p>He said: 'I think the key ask of the government is, what is happening with testing? Because we've had all these stories in recent days of people trying to book a test, people who are ill, they are sick, they think they've got symptoms of Covid, and they've been told to travel miles and miles, sometimes over 100 miles to get to a testing centre. That is clearly unacceptable. </p>

<p>'So we are asking the Government, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, to come to the commons quickly. Tell us what they think is happening with the infection rate today, and tell us what he is going to do to fix the fiasco in testing in recent days.' </p>

<p>Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said he feared the outbreak was a 'return to exponential growth', and if so 'we can expect further increases over coming weeks.'  </p>

<p>He said yesterday: 'Today's reported number of cases is the largest new cases reported in a single day since May. This is especially concerning for a Sunday when report numbers are generally lower than most other days of the week.</p>

<p>'Some of that increase may be because of catch up from delayed tests over the past few days due to the widely reported difficulties the UK testing service has faced dealing with the number of tests being requested. </p>

<p>'Nevertheless this represents a marked increase in the 7 day rolling average of 1812 cases/day compared to 1244 a week ago and 1040 a week before that.'</p>

<p>On May 23, 220 people died from Covid-19, but yesterday's death toll was significantly smaller. A further two people died after testing positive for the bug in the 28 days prior.</p>

<p>Professor Hunter said: 'Fortunately, the daily reported numbers of deaths due to COVID-19 remain very low with a 7 day rolling average of just 7 deaths/day. </p>

<p>'However, with the new approach to recording deaths it is difficult to be confident that there are timely statistics. It with be another two or even more weeks before we can really expect to see any impact on mortality figures.' </p>
