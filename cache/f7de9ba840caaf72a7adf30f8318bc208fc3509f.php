<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Climate change activists have brought Brisbane's peak hour traffic to a crawl by cycling as slow as possible on a major road.    </p>

<p>Up to 45 demonstrators from Extinction Rebellion are riding bicycles through the city in a slow-moving blockade on Monday. </p>

<p>Kicking off at Kurilpa Park, South Brisbane, at 7.30am the two-hour-long protest is part of a push for Australia to sign on to a binding target of zero net carbon emissions by 2025, overseen by a citizen's assembly.</p>

<p>Extinction Rebellion activists have brought traffic to a crawl in Brisbane by deliberately cycling slow to protest against Australia's climate change policies</p>

<p>'We will be riding as slowly as possible to disrupt peak hour traffic to bring attention to the climate and ecological crisis,' organisers said in a Facebook post.</p>

<p>'We are headed for complete annihilation. The amount of warming we are on track for, will literally mean the death of billions of people.' </p>

<p>'Scientists say that at 4 or 5 degrees of warming, the earth could sustain a billion people. Our governments could push us to 7 degrees of warming.'</p>

<p>Rally organisers have told demonstrators to be COVID-19 safe by travelling in small groups of 10, social distancing and donning masks as they cycle towards King George Square. </p>

<p>Organisers listed 'legal tips' in a Facebook post advising attendees not to communicate with police. </p>

<p>'There will be police liaisons at this protest, they will communicate between the police and activists,' the post read.</p>

<p>Members of the group spoke at Kurilpa Park, in South Brisbane, before the protest kicked off at 7.30am</p>

<p>'If the police approach you please direct them to the designated police liaisons.'</p>

<p>'In the past they have not arrested anybody for cycling slowly at similar events …'</p>

<p>Protesters live streamed the disruptive ride over Facebook, with footage showing them chanting 'climate justice' and blasting anthems, such as John Farnham's 'You're the Voice'. </p>

<p>The group are known for conducting extreme high profile stunts for the sake of their cause.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, the activism group dumped manure outside News Corp offices around the city to protest against their coverage of climate change. </p>

<p>During a demonstration last year, an activist in Brisbane hung from Story Bridge while other demonstrators glued themselves to the ground. </p>
