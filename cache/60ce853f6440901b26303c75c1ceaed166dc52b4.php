<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you want to get more and better quality rest, don't underestimate the power of a high-quality light-blocking eye mask. It's the perfect solution if you're having trouble sleeping.</p>

<p>Amazon has tons of markdowns in its End of Summer Sale, and beyond phones and smart watches, there are some impressive sales on popular eye masks including 43 per cent off the premium PaiTree Eye Mask for Sleeping.</p>

<p>While a Prime membership is not required to shop the sale, it ends Tuesday September 1, so be sure to buy what you want now before the prices go back up or the products go out of stock.</p>

<p>Now 43 per cent off in Amazon's End of Summer Sale, the PaiTree Eye Mask blocks out all light creating total darkness for the perfect night's sleep</p>

<p>Now £6.79, the eye mask is an affordable solution for blocking out light. Not only does the 3D design allow no light to enter, but the lightweight skin-friendly fabric and the contoured fit create a comfortable environment for you to drift off.</p>

<p>Amazon customers praise the PaiTree Eye Mask's pressure-relieving contoured design saying it has completely transformed their bedtime routines. Reviewers describe it as 'the best eye mask', 'comfortable', and 'brilliant value for money'.</p>

<p>'Perfect for a good nights sleep', one shopper wrote in their five-star review. 'If any amount of light disturbs you, this will mask will block it out. Very comfy to wear and it doesn't push on your eyes, do not feel like they make you hot, I would definitely recommend these masks.'</p>

<p>Another customer added: 'Best ever sleep mask. So comfortable you don't know it's on, cuts light out completely.'</p>

<p>A third wrote: 'I CANNOT go to sleep without this. As a very light sleeper, any amount of light disturbs my sleep, this is soo comfortable, and I reach for this every single night now without fail.'</p>

<p>The £6.79 Paitree Eye Mask secures with Velcro rather than uncomfortable plastic fastening </p>

<p>The manufacturers say the PaiTree Eye Mask is successful thanks to its ability to achieve total darkness combined with its patented shade nose design, which ensures a tight seal on the nose bridge.</p>

<p>And unlike classic sleep masks, its design is wider and deeper to create little to no pressure on your eyelids, which is ideal you want to preserve your eye-makeup or lash extensions when taking a quick nap.</p>

<p>The extra room also allows your eyes to blink freely, yet it still properly traps light, removing tension from your eyes and helping the body and nervous system to switch to night mode.</p>

<p>Plus, unlike many eye masks that fasten on the sides, the PaiTree Eye Mask has a soft Velcro strap at the back of the head so is perfect for side sleepers. And if you're a restless sleeper, it's secure and durable enough to hold the mask in place.</p>
