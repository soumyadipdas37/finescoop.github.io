<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenager who hacked at his 12-year-old girlfriend with a machete because she 'didn't listen to him' has avoided jail.</p>

<p>The then 16-year-old, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory to attacking his then-girlfriend in October 2018.</p>

<p>He had been sniffing aerosols on the Galiwinku oval with the girl, who he had been in a relationship for about six months, in the early hours of October 30, 2018.</p>

<p>The 12-year-old girl was not intoxicated and began to walk home, NT News reported.</p>

<p>A teenager who viciously hacked at his 12-year-old girlfriend with a machete because she 'didn't listen to him' has avoided jail</p>

<p>As the girl was leaving another child 'found' a machete, the court heard.</p>

<p>The boy said: 'Give me that machete because I have to bash that little girl for not listening to me'.</p>

<p>The boy then followed the girl and hit her in the upper arm with the weapon, the court heard.</p>

<p>She fell to the ground and the teenager stood over her and continued to assault her by swinging the knife 'in a chopping motion' to the girl's face and head.</p>

<p>One of the girl's friends pushed the 16-year-old away. </p>

<p>Chief Justice Michael Grant acknowledged it was the only reason the attack stopped.</p>

<p>The 12-year-old was airlifted to Royal Darwin Hospital for emergency surgery for the severe lacerations to her skull and arms, broken knuckles and severed tendons in both hands.</p>

<p>She was required to stay in hospital for a month and needed both splints and hand therapy to regain full function of her hands.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Grant said without the quick action from specialists at the hospital the girl may have lost the use of both hands, or died.</p>

<p>The girl still suffers from pins and needles as well as stuff and numb hands. </p>

<p>'What you did has obviously had a terrible impact on the victim, including in ways that we would not necessarily expect,' he told the teenager.</p>

<p>The then 16-year-old, who cannot be named due to legal reasons, pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory to attacking his girlfriend at the time in October 2018</p>

<p>'When she was recovering, she could not feed, bathe or dress herself. Her big sister had to do that for her, which caused them both shame for cultural reasons.' </p>

<p>Chief Justice Grant acknowledged the teenager had since been diagnosed with an intellectual disability but said he had not accepted 'how serious the offending was'.</p>

<p>The chief justice also said the teenager did not realise the impact his actions had on the girl or felt any remorse.</p>

<p>'When asked about the offending during the course of a psychiatric assessment, you sought to attribute blame for what happened to your friends urging you to hit the girl,' he said. </p>

<p>The teenager was given a suspended sentence after spending four months in jail before being bailed in March last year.</p>
