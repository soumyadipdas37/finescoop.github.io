<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A love rival smashed a mother-of-one's face with a bottle in a nightclub toilet in a row over a man that left her scarred for life.</p>

<p>Hannah Gwillim, 21, was bottled at the venue in Swansea by Jodie Edwards, who previously had a fling with the victim's now ex-boyfriend.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old said she was goaded by Hannah and accused of giving the mother's then-partner a sexually transmitted disease.</p>

<p>But Hannah poured scorn on Edwards' claim after her rival pleaded guilty to the assault at Swansea Crown Court.</p>

<p>Hannah said: 'It was carnage, a real bloodbath. I was out for a fun night and ended up being pushed out of the nightclub in a wheelchair and taken to hospital.</p>

<p>'As a result, I'm scarred for life.' </p>

<p>Hannah, from Swansea, recalled how a night out in August last year ended in violence after she got separated from her friends.</p>

<p>She said: 'I love getting dolled up and hitting Swansea's bars and nightclubs. In August last year, I was out with the girls for a friend's birthday.</p>

<p>'I'd lost my friends earlier in the night and arrived at Fiction, which is Swansea's largest nightclub, without them.</p>

<p>'But I knew a lot of people in the club. I was having fun and I knew I'd catch up with my mates later.'</p>

<p>Hannah, above, was left nursing bruised and swollen eyes after being bottled by Edwards</p>

<p>After a few drinks, Hannah remembers needing the toilet.</p>

<p>'When I flung open the bathroom door, I instantly recognised the woman standing in front of the mirror,' she says. 'It was Jodie Edwards.'</p>

<p>'The year before, she'd slept with my long-term partner. We'd been together four years but when I found out he had cheated on me, it was the end.</p>

<p>'It was painful at the time but I'd moved on. If I'm honest, our break up was the best thing that could have happened and I thanked him for it.' </p>

<p>But Edwards recognised Hannah and their eyes met in the mirror.</p>

<p>Hannah said: 'Jodie spotted me and smirked knowingly. Without thinking, I laughed in her face and threw my drink over her head.</p>

<p>'I know it was wrong to do that but it was my first instinct when I saw her smug face. And I didn't certainly deserve what came next.</p>

<p>'Jodie smashed a glass bottle over my head twice. I fell to the floor and the last thing I remember, Jodie was hunched over me, hitting me repeatedly.'</p>

<p>When Hannah came round, she was lying in A&amp;E.</p>

<p>The exchange between Hannah and Edwards, in which she said she had a fling with the mother-of-one's now ex-boyfriend. Edwards recognised Hannah in the nightclub's toilets</p>

<p>She commented: 'There was a gash in my forehead. The back of my head was also cut and I had a broken finger. Medics stitched me up and sent me on my way.</p>

<p>'My little girl saw my bandaged face the next day and burst into tears. I had to reassure her that mummy would be okay.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-one pieced together the events of the previous night and gave a statement to the police.</p>

<p>Edwards, above, was handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years </p>

<p>'My memory of what happened was hazy but my friends told me that I was being pushed out of the nightclub in a wheelchair covered in blood when they arrived,' she said. </p>

<p>'The walls and the floor of the ladies' toilets were awash with blood. They were all worried sick about me.'</p>

<p>Police charged Edwards for the attack and she pleaded guilty to GBH without intent at Swansea Crown court last week.</p>

<p>In her defence, she said Hannah accused her of giving her ex-boyfriend a sexually transmitted disease - a claim that Hannah denies.</p>

<p>Edwards was handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to complete a rehabilitation course.</p>

<p>She was also ordered to pay £1000 in compensation to Hannah.</p>

<p>Hannah said: 'This was the first I'd heard about a STD and it's nonsense. My injuries healed well but I'm left with a scar in the centre of my forehead.</p>

<p>'I'm scarred for life thanks to Edwards but I've put what happened behind me and moved on with my life.'</p>
