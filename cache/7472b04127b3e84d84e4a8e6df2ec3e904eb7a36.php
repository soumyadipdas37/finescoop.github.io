<p>While celebrating Easter earlier this year Amanda's youngest daughter Hollie was even seen doing an egg hunt near the bunny house. </p>

<p>It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday.</p>

<p>The presenter slipped into a plunging gold metallic dress as she took her place on the socially-distanced judging panel </p>

<p>Amanda was in high spirits after being promoted to head judge for the semi-finals, as it was also revealed that her debut album Songs From My Heart had reached number one on the iTunes pre-order charts.  </p>

<p>Due to Simon Cowell's absence Amanda has been promoted to head judge, and she was quick to joke she'll be backing 'musical theatre all the way.' </p>

<p>Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. </p>

<p>The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.  </p>

<p>Wow! It comes after Amanda made a dramatic entrance for the first Britain's Got Talent semi-final on Saturday</p>
