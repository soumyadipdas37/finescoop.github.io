<p>Sephora Australia is set to launch an epic 'beauty pass' sale, giving customers 20 per cent off everything in store and online - but there is a catch</p>

<p>So even if a customer signs up today they will still get 15 per cent off items at the checkout come September 3.</p>

<p>During the sale period those with a 20 per cent discount will be able to get It Cosmetics CC Cream with SPF 50+ for $50.40, when it's usually $63.  </p>
