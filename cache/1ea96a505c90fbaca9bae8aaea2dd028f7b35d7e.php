<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Satellite imagery of a North Korean shipyard on Friday shows activity suggestive of preparations for a test of a medium-range submarine-launched ballistic missile, a US think tank reported on Friday.</p>

<p>The Center for Strategic and International Studies said the images it published on its website of North Korea's Sinpo shipyard showed several vessels within a secure boat basin, one of which resembled vessels previously used to tow a submersible test stand barge out to sea.</p>

<p>It said the activity was 'suggestive, but not conclusive, of preparations for an upcoming test of a Pukguksong-3 submarine launched ballistic missile from the submersible test stand barge.'</p>

<p>North Korea said last October it had successfully test-fired a Pukguksong-3, a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), from the sea as part of efforts to contain external threats and bolster self-defence.</p>

<p>That launch was seen by analysts as the most provocative by North Korea since it entered dialogue with the United States over its nuclear weapons and missile programs in 2018.</p>

<p>North Korea has suspended long-range missile and nuclear tests since 2017, but efforts led by U.S. President Donald Trump to persuade it to give up its nuclear and missile programs have achieved little. </p>

<p>Trump is seeking reelection in November and a North Korean missile test before that would highlight the lack of progress despite Trump's unprecedented meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

<p>There was no immediate comment from the State Department or the Pentagon on the CSIS report.  </p>

<p>At news conference earlier on Friday, Trump hailed his relationship with North Korea, saying that when he was elected people had predicted he would be at war with the country within a week.</p>

<p>'In the meantime, we've gotten along with them. We didn't get to war,' he said. </p>

<p>Trump has held up the absence of intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea since 2017 as a success from his diplomacy and has sought to play down numerous shorter-range tests in the period.</p>

<p>'North Korea already tested a PKS-3 SLBM last October. And it didn't cross Trump's redline then, and is unlikely to this time. Trump won't care,' Vipin Narang, a non-proliferation expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>South Korea's military said the Pukguksong-3 tested last year flew 280 miles and reached an altitude of 565 miles and would have had a range of about 800 miles on a standard trajectory.</p>

<p>News of the activity at Sinpo comes amid signs that North Korea may be preparing for a major military parade in October, which some analysts believe could be used to show off new missiles as the country has done at such events in the past</p>
