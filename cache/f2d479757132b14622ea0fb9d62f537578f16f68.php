<p>The dog's 53-year-old owner, Yoko Kikuchi, of Hong Kong, is often amused at the behaviour of pet Hina </p>

<p>Hina adorably ruins the pictures by pulling funny faces or not facing the camera while her siblings sit perfectly.  </p>

<p>Ms Kikuchi, a yoga instructor, said: 'Her nickname is 'Destroyer' as she loves chewing our shoes, cables, headphones and things. </p>

<p>'But she is the most obedient one, no leads needed on walks as she walks with us all the time. </p>

<p>'She is very shy with humans but loves all dogs.' </p>

<p>She added: 'She yawns a lot and I just happen catch the moment in the photos. I take so many photos and it just make me laugh now when I catch the moment.</p>

<p>Ms Kikuchi stresses that Hina is usually the 'most obedient of the pooches' despite ruining the photos  </p>

<p>She pulls funny faces in the otherwise perfect picture with her owner describing her as 'the cheeky one' </p>

<p>'She's the cheeky one. She is the youngest among the four dogs though.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-one claims she used to hate dogs but she met her husband who convinced her to take Sasha, Kikko and Momo in.</p>

<p>Hina became the latest addition around two years ago.</p>

<p>She said: 'My husband originally said no to taking in Hina.</p>

<p>'I couldn't stop thinking of her, as she was a lovely White Shiba. I begged my husband to take her. He finally said yes.'</p>

<p>Humorous Hina's nickname is 'Destroyer' because she loves chewing on her owner's shoes, cables and headphones</p>

<p>The charming pooch is the youngest of the four and often doesn't face the camera in pictures while her siblings pose perfectly </p>
