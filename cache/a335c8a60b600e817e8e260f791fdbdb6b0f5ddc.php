<p>The imperial Beijing-enamelled wine ewer had been gathering dust for years after being boxed up by a family who never realised its true value.</p>

<p>But after unearthing the object during a lockdown clear-out at his Derbyshire home, the 51-year-old owner decided to take it to be valued by auction experts.</p>

<p>Hansons owner Charles Hanson said ewers and teapots of this type were fashionable at court during the period and may have been handled by Emperor Qianlong himself</p>

<p>The wine ewer, which has a rectangular form, is brightly decorated on a lemon-yellow ground with colourful blooming peonies in hues of pinks, blues and purples</p>

<p>The owner, 51, from Derbyshire, who does not want to be named, said: 'We'd been thinking of sending everything to a charity shop.</p>

<p>'But then lockdown came along. I'd always thought the teapot was special.</p>

<p>'We believe it was brought back from China by my grandfather, who was stationed in the Far East during the Second World War.'</p>

<p>He searched the internet and found a similar item in an auction, so took the 6in pot to Hansons in Etwall, Derbyshire, where it was identified as a ewer used to serve warm wine during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor between 1735 and 1796. It will be sold on September 24 and experts say it could make £40,000 to £100,000.</p>

<p>Hansons owner Charles Hanson said ewers and teapots of this type were fashionable at court during the period and may have been handled by Emperor Qianlong himself.</p>

<p>He added: 'This has to be the best lockdown find ever. It is such an exciting discovery, an imperial 18th century wine ewer which would have graced a palace in China and was, perhaps, handled by Emperor Qianlong, considered by some to be the greatest Chinese emperor.</p>

<p>'Two almost identical teapots, both with Qianlong reign marks, exist in the National Palace Museum in Taipei, Taiwan, and the Palace Museum in Beijing, China.</p>

<p>'It's truly astonishing to find an emperor's wine ewer in a Derbyshire home, an object used to serve warm wine during important ceremonies.</p>

<p>'He was fascinated by European enamel and the new method of enamel painting and the style was replicated in his imperial workshops.</p>

<p>'During Emperor Qianlong's reign this art form reached heady heights of perfection with designs reflecting the emperor's extravagant taste.</p>

<p>'The delicate wine ewer is a fine example of the perfect combination of an elegant shape, lavish colouration and technical perfection.</p>

<p>'Emperor Qianlong must have been especially fond of this vessel as a number of them were made, hence the existence of two similar examples in important museums in Taiwan and China.'</p>

<p>The wine ewer, which has a rectangular form, is brightly decorated on a lemon-yellow ground with colourful blooming peonies in hues of pinks, blues and purples.</p>

<p>Hansons' valuer Edward Rycroft said: 'I knew it was special and persuaded the vendor to leave it with us so we could carry out some research.</p>

<p>'We were delighted to tell him later that it could be worth tens of thousands of pounds.'</p>
