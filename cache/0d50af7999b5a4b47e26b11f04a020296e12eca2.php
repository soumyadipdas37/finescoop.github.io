<p>Fitness journey: Last month, Katie showed off her toned physique in a candid Instagram post where she discussed the importance of finding time to train her body as a single mother</p>

<p>Single mum: The singer looked incredible in simple grey Calvin Klein lingerie as she documented her postpartum fitness journey, stating: 'I didn't have my son and then wake up like this' (pictured with son Hudson in 2019)</p>

<p>Referring to her lingerie-clad image, she said: 'This is me two years post partum. I didn't have my son and then wake up like this, I have worked hard and enjoyed the process of the ebs and flows of a forever lifestyle change, most days are great, some are not, but hey that is life.</p>

<p>'It poses the bigger question then of why are we so insistent that a change needs to be instant? I too have experienced the impatient feeling of 'I wish it would happen right now, right this second' but sometimes a reset, a restore, a rebuild, in whatever it is that we are looking to change doesn't happen overnight.'</p>

<p>The singer then went on to give words of encouragement to her fans and urged them to make their own attainable goals.</p>

<p>'Break it down into small achievable parts, conquer them, and build your courage strength and confidence! Before you know it, you would have surpassed that end goal 10 fold and be onto your next one. </p>

<p>'Point in fact, don't FIND time, MAKE time. BELIEVE IN YOU!'</p>
