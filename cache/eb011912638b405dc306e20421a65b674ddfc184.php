<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>While face coverings help protect us and those around us, wearing the new everyday essential can cause breakouts in a side effect known as 'maskne'.</p>

<p>And if there's one skincare product that's an absolute must-have for fighting face mask breakouts, it's Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant.</p>

<p>Shoppers describe the cult-favourite skincare product, which costs £13 for 30ml, as a 'miracle worker', saying that it 'works like magic on spots'. In fact, shoppers love the liquid exfoliant so much, they've left it over 1,000 positive reviews to date - and it's often out of stock.</p>

<p>Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant contains 2 per cent BHA (salicylic acid), which boasts anti-inflammatory properties and helps to reduce blemishes and redness </p>

<p>Salicylic acid is a tried-and-true ingredient that can work wonders on your skin. The beta-hydroxy acid (BHA) is an active ingredient and an incredible chemical exfoliator. </p>

<p>Most spot treatments contain a percentage of salicylic acid (which is derived from willow trees) to help remove dead skin cells clogging pores.</p>

<p>This gentle liquid exfoliant from US skincare brand Paula's Choice contains 2 per cent salicylic acid. Suitable for all skin types, especially normal, oily or combination, the leave-on exfoliant gently deep cleans pores to help eliminate acne.</p>

<p>'I'm a healthcare worker, and with having to wear masks for 12-hour shifts, my skin was in a right mess with bad acne outbreaks,' explained one user in their five-star review. </p>

<p>'I started applying this under my moisturiser after double cleansing (which I always do), and the difference was amazing! The redness and inflammation were gone, and it has also reduced the amount of outbreaks I get.'</p>

<p>Another shopper wrote: 'Have struggled with open pores and bumpy, uneven skin for years, and more recently have had some problems with hormonal acne.</p>

<p>'This is a life-changer. My skin is smoother, it looks dewy and healthy for the first time ever, and I haven't had any new spots in weeks!'</p>

<p>This gentle, lightweight fluid quickly exfoliates dead skin cells both on the surface and deep inside pores to reveal smoother, clearer, more radiant-looking skin </p>

<p>The exfoliation also helps to fade lingering acne scars while promoting a brighter, smoother and even texture for a more clarified complexion. Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant doesn't cost the earth either.</p>

<p>A third customer wrote: 'In short, this lives up to the hype. It has a noticeable effect immediately - after one use, at night, my skin felt really smooth and looked better, almost like a blurring of the pores and skin texture but most impressively, I had absolutely no oily patches.'</p>

<p>They added: 'I have now bought the full-size bottle. I've tried similar products, and I don't know what the difference is but for me at least, this is revolutionary stuff.'</p>

<p>For best results, use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant on cleansed dry skin. Begin by lightly soaking a reusable cotton pad and apply over the entire face, including the eye area (avoid lash line and eyelids). There is no need to rinse.</p>

<p>As with all exfoliants, follow with a sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher when applied during the day, as your skin will be more susceptible to sun damage.</p>
