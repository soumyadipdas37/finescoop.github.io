<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Oxford-educated cancer doctor nicknamed 'God' is facing a disciplinary hearing amid allegations that he gave inappropriate treatment to terminally ill patients in a bid to extend their life.</p>

<p>Cancer expert Professor Justin Stebbing, 49, is accused of having 'failed to provide good clinical care' to 11 people between March 2014 and March 2017.</p>

<p>The doctor is often called on by extraordinarily-wealthy cancer sufferers from around the globe and has a reputation for being 'aggressive' in his treatment plans - even when a patient is near to death.</p>

<p>Professor Stebbing - who treated New Zealand multi-millionaire Sir Douglas Myers and Doctor Who actress Lynda Bellingham - is a cancer medicine and oncology professor at Imperial College London and has a private Harley Street office.</p>

<p>Oxford-educated cancer doctor Professor Justin Stebbing, 49, is facing a disciplinary hearing amid allegations that he gave inappropriate treatment to terminally ill patients in a bid to extend their life</p>

<p>One accusation claims he suggested 'open-ended platinum doublet chemotherapy' to a patient, even though this was 'unsupported by clinical evidence' and fell 'outside national guidelines'. </p>

<p>Another claims he backdated insurance documents.</p>

<p>He allegedly falsely claimed a meeting between colleagues had taken place prior to him signing off a Bupa insurance application for cancer drug funding. </p>

<p>He also gave £19,500-per-dose pembrolizumab to a patient while there was 'no evidence of any response to the treatment', the allegations reported by The Times claim.</p>

<p>Another patient had their treatment 'ceiling' increased by  Professor Stebbing - who did not speak to his colleagues first.</p>

<p>That same patient had their 'do not resuscitate' instruction removed by the doctor without him consulting his fellows beforehand.</p>

<p>The professor was suspended from certain leading private health insurers' lists of recognised consultants in the midst of worries about certain drugs he was giving to patients.</p>

<p>The accusations came after a General Medical Council investigation.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those backing the expert have highlighted the  fact that Sir Douglas stayed alive for four years after spending thousands of pounds on Professor Stebbing's treatment.  </p>

<p>The tycoon was given just weeks to live prior to the pair's first meeting.</p>

<p>Ms Bellingham lived for an extra 15 months after his treatment.</p>

<p>Today, a hearing of the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service continued in Manchester. It will resume on several days until March 2021. </p>

<p>Professor Stebbing has been approached for comment.</p>
