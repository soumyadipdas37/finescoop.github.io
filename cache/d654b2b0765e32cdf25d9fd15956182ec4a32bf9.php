<p>Earlier this month, Blair celebrated the milestone of getting back on her horse Mr. Nibbles for a riding session.</p>

<p>In 2018, she revealed she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and as symptoms progressed, it curbed her ability to ride.</p>

<p>But on August 8, she shared excitedly on her Instagram that she'd been able to get back in the saddle for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p>Despite not being able to 'feel my left leg, or where my hips are', she managed to ride a few circuits of the ring and take a few low jumps on the gray.</p>

<p>'Today, we managed to get it together to have a few minutes and I could not stop smiling,' she wrote alongside the snaps. </p>
