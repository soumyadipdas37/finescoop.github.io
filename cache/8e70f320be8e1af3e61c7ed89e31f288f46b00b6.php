<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Queen is said to have loved a punk portrait depicting her with blue hair and a tattoo with 'Phillip,' written across it, but wish it had been replaced with a royal crest.</p>

<p>Artist Mark Sloper created the portrait of the 94-year-old with blue hair, a nose ring and a love heart tattoo.</p>

<p>He claims to have faced off against an irate cavalry officer after placing the piece in the window of his gallery near Buckingham Palace.</p>

<p>The Queen, 94, was said to have laughed at the portrait, but wanted to swap a love heart tattoo with Phillip written on it for a royal crest</p>

<p>Artist Mark Sloper created the portrait of the 94-year-old with blue hair, a nose ring and a love heart tattoo </p>

<p>The 55-year-old artist says he passed a copy of the print to a friend, who just so happened to know the Queen's lady in waiting, The Sun reports.  </p>

<p>Mr Sloper says we was told by a guardsmen that the painting was in poor taste against Britain's longest reigning monarch.</p>

<p>But he supposedly got a different review from Her Majesty.</p>

<p>Mark, who exhibits as Mark Illuminati, told The Sun: 'The message was she said it was really good but didn't like the Philip tattoo and would prefer the lion and unicorn crest.</p>

<p>'I never got the print back so assume it may be hanging in her toilet. </p>

<p>'When I was told she had been shown the portrait, I was happy to make the change.' </p>

<p>Artist Mark Sloper, right, will sell the piece next month at the Saatchi Gallery in London </p>
