<p>Emma Smith (right), 30, of Fettercairn, Aberdeenshire told how one-year-old Archie dipped his big sister's make-up brush into a wax burner in the hallway and proceeded to spread the liquid across a 6ft stretch of wall and dropped dollops on the floor. Left, Archie at home </p>

<p>When she poked her head through the door she discovered the bloody-looking trail of destruction - and a grinning Archie.  </p>

<p>She said: 'They say silence is golden but not when Archie is around. He's a feral child, I thought my middle child was bad but my youngest has topped that.</p>

<p>'It looked like a murder scene, I came running out of the kitchen and said "oh my god what have you done?" and he just stood and laughed with a makeup brush in his hand. Even now when I ask him "why have you painted mummy's hall?", he just smirks and laughs.'</p>

<p>Archie had used the melted wax from a plug-in burner, meaning the cheeky toddler wasn't at risk from burning himself.</p>

<p>When Emma poked her head through the door she discovered the bloody-looking trail of destruction (pictured) - and a grinning Archie. The mess took more than an hour to clean</p>

<p>Archie had also dropped dollops of wax on the hallway carpet (pictured), which Emma cleaned</p>

<p>Emma said: 'I have the plug-in burners everywhere, but the one he used was in the hallway. Angel ushered Archie away while steam was coming out of my ears.</p>

<p>'I had to go back to the kitchen, turn off the food I was cooking and then had to get it off the wall. I had to wait until the wax had dried then spent 45 minutes using a hairdryer to re-melt it and a cloth to scrub it off my wall.</p>

<p>'It formed thick clumps in the carpet but I managed to lift it out.    </p>

<p>'When Stuart found out it had been on the walls he just asked "are we going to have to redecorate?" Just a usual man moaning.</p>

<p>'I bleached the wall to remove the remaining marks on the walls but because I know the marks are there I can see a tint of colour so we'll have to redecorate. The burner has since been removed.'</p>

<p>Emma with partner Stuart and her children Angel, 10, Angus, four, and one-year-old Archie</p>

<p>Emma said this is the worst incident out of a catalogue of mischief Archie has got himself into, and fears what's to come.</p>

<p>Emma said: 'Archie is very free-spirited and is always up to no good.</p>

<p>'We live on a farm and have a small fence between our house and next door and he has a habit of digging underneath the fence, like a dog would do, to escape into next door's garden.</p>

<p>'Archie's also escaped into the fields, got behind the shed and also dug up flowers.</p>

<p>'Our dog Jock just toddles on behind him, he's definitely one-of-a-kind, wherever Archie is Jock's not far behind, they're best of friends.</p>

<p>'He's that kid that if it was someone else's you'd laugh about it but when it's your own you can't.</p>

<p>'I thought Angus was the worst because he used to get up to no good as a toddler but he's very couthy [sociable] now, while Angel's always got her head in a book.'</p>

<p>As Archie turns two next month, Emma dreads what escapades she'll face as he hits the 'terrible twos'.</p>

<p>Emma said: 'It's probably the worst thing he's done to date, but I imagine there's more to come.</p>

<p>'We're heading toward 'terrible twos' territory and I'm dreading it, Archie is full of surprises he definitely keeps me on my toes.'</p>
