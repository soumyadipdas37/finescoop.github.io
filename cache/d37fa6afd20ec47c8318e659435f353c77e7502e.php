<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They have been dating for months after meeting and falling for each other following his split from ex-wife, Kyly.</p>

<p>And Michael Clarke and Pip Edwards continue to flaunt their romance all over social media.</p>

<p>P.E Nation designer Pip, 40, posted a picture of the pair snuggling up in his designer closet at his Bondi Beach pad on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>They're smitten! Pip Edwards snuggled up to former Australian Cricket Captain Michael Clarke in his designer closet this week as she continues to spend more time at his mansion</p>

<p>In the picture, former Australian cricket captain Michael, 39, was seen wrapping his arm around the business mogul's neck and tenderly caressing her arm. </p>

<p>Pip was barefoot in his impressive closet, wearing a pair of baggy casual black trousers and a white tank top. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael was sporty in black shorts, an olive green T-shirt and some Off White Nike sneakers. </p>

<p>Pip appears to be spending more and more time at Michael's home, as evident from her Instagram selfies.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, in a rare interview for The Daily Telegraph's Stellar magazine, Michael reflected on his life, a year after separating from wife of seven years, Kyly Clarke.</p>

<p>While he preferred to keep coy about his new romance with Pip, the retired Australian cricketer did reveal that he's 'so happy right now' and is 'in a great place'.</p>

<p>'The people who know me know I'm extremely private or try and be as private as I can with my personal life,' he said.</p>

<p>Hesitant to provide much insight on his new life with Pip the radio host did say that he couldn't be happier.</p>

<p>'In regards to me personally? I'm so happy right now. I'm in a great place. That's all I can ask for,' he said.</p>

<p>Michael went on to add that if negative attention is directed at his daughter or partner, it always hits him 'much harder' than if it were something 'thrown' at him.</p>

<p>The sporting great had separated from Kyly, 39, in September last year, but only revealed their split in a surprise announcement on February 12.</p>

<p>It is understood there was no third party involved in their shock split.</p>

<p>The Clarkes have said the 'amicable' decision to separate was 'the best course' for their daughter Kelsey Lee.</p>

<p>Reports surfaced Michael had begun dating Pip after his separation with Kyly became public knowledge.</p>

<p>Pip seemingly confirmed their relationship by going 'Instagram Official' in July, and the pair enjoyed a PDA-filled trip to Noosa, Queensland that same month.</p>
