<p>He added that he was 'so proud of my family, my sons, my brother-in-law who were there.'</p>

<p>Buddy said he somehow remained calm, and was able to direct his sons to grab tools to get him loose because he was stuck.</p>

<p>He told TMZ: 'My sons got pliers, they took a bolt out' and sawed off the machine.</p>

<p>'You appreciate doctors and what they do' when going through situations like this, noting that 'it just really shows you how much they do and how great they are. Between Morristown Hospital and HHS City - Dr. Carlson. They are miracle workers. God bless them for what they do.'</p>

<p>The TV veteran had to endure two surgeries and was in the hospital for several days as seen in Instagram photos.</p>

<p>On Monday he described the horrible incident while on the Today show as he called it a 'freak accident' that was 'crazy' before crediting his son with 'jumping into action' to free him from the machine that repeatedly cut into his hand.</p>

<p>First interview: Buddy talked to the Today show on Monday</p>

<p>He said he feels 'as good as I can.'</p>

<p>'It's just a really freak accident. You know, it was crazy just the way it went down,' said the pastry chef as he propped his bandaged hand on top of a pillow while wearing a white T-shirt and gold medallion as he sat inside his home in Montville, New Jersey.</p>

<p>'But I really am so proud of my sons and brother-in-laws who were here and really helped jump into action to set me free and help put me on the road to recovery.'</p>

<p>His has sons Buddy Jr., 16, Marco, 13, and Carlo, nine, as well as daughter Sofia, 17, with wife Lisa. </p>

<p>Buddy Jr was also present during the Today interview. </p>

<p>By his side: The star's son Buddy Jr, who helped him during the harrowing home accident, was also on the morning show </p>

<p>He said, 'I mean, he's my dad… I knew I had to do something. My aunt was going crazy, people were crying. So, he told me to grab the saw, the tools. So I ran up and got them and got him out.' </p>

<p>Buddy said he jumped on the machine to fix it, which he has done many times in the past. </p>

<p>'The machine got stuck and I went behind it to fix it, which I've done 100 times, and for one split moment I must've turned my head and then my right hand got caught between a fork and this other mechanism that goes through the fork and it kind of wedged my hand in there,' he explained.</p>

<p>'It blew through my ring finger and my middle finger as it barbed in my hand and I was stuck. It kind of crushed my thumb cause it was still moving back and forth.</p>

<p>'For some crazy reason I'm on top of this thing and got this metal rod through my hand, blood is everywhere, I don't know what kept me calm cause I was in excruciating pain.</p>

<p>Good son: He called the incident a 'freak accident' that was 'crazy' before crediting his son with 'jumping into action' to free him from the machine that repeatedly cut into his hand</p>

<p>Out of the blue: 'It's just a really freak accident. You know, it was crazy just the way it went down,' said the pastry chef</p>

<p>'Something told me to stay calm and I told my sons, "You have to get me off this machine."</p>

<p>“I couldn't be prouder of my two sons - they jumped into action - and within five minutes they had to undo a bolt, saw off one piece of metal, and then I was in my driveway. We jumped into my brother in law's car and drove down to Morristown Hospital.'</p>

<p> Valastro also thanked first responders and doctors, saying, 'when push really comes to shove, you see what a miracle worker they are.' </p>

<p>Family first: 'But I really am so proud of my sons and brother-in-laws who were here and really helped jump into action to set me free and help put me on the road to recovery,' he said</p>

<p>'I hope to make a full recovery. I'm praying, we've got a lot of prayers,' he said. 'Moments like this actually do other things for you because I've always appreciated doctors and first responders and people who take care of us but when you wind up in a situation like this and they just took care of me and nursed me back to where I am. I am so forever grateful I want to kiss their hands and just thank them for doing what they did.' </p>

<p>Buddy then started crying when he said he was so proud of his son and expressed he felt bad that his son had to experience the accident. He then thanked his child.</p>

<p>He will be spending the next few months in recovery as he tries to regain use of his hand.</p>

<p>The injury, which he has described as 'terrible,' happened over a week ago when he was bowling with his wife Lisa and their kids at his home in New Jersey.</p>

<p>His son was a hero: He said, 'I mean, he's my dad… I knew I had to do something. So, he told me to grab the saw, the tools. So I ran up and got them and got him out'</p>

<p>Buddy shared the news on Facebook when he uploaded a photo of himself in a hospital bed with his arm propped up.</p>

<p>'I was involved in a terrible accident a few days ago,' he wrote in the caption. 'What do you think of my new accessory?' he joked about his cast.   </p>

<p>'Hey guys, Buddy here, I had a really bad accident the other day at my house with my hand ... thank you for all your love and support, we're going to get through this together,' he added on Instagram.</p>

<p>He was released from the hospital last Wednesday and is recovering at home.  </p>
