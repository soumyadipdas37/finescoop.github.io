<p>She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.</p>

<p>'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: "Oh my God, he's for real." I was completely speechless.'</p>
