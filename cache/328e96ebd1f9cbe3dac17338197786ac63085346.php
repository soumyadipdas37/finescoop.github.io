<p>Governor Gavin Newsom has declared a state of emergency as a series of wildfires ravage his state</p>

<p>Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, on Sunday declared a state of emergency in five counties, including San Bernardino County due to the El Dorado Fire which continues to be 'extremely active' due to dry vegetation, steep terrain and sweltering hot weather across the region.  </p>

<p>Officials are asking that residents heed evacuation warnings and travelers stay clear of the fire area.</p>

<p>'We need to keep the firefighters we do have focused on firefighting and not on managing people,' fire officials said in a joint press release issued on Sunday. </p>

<p>The El Dorado Fire is currently burning two miles from where the Apple Fire destroyed 33,000 acres last month.</p>

<p>Fire officials said that it could be helpful, because the El Dorado Fire could enter the 'burn scar' and peter out.</p>

<p>The Apple Fire, which had been 95 per cent contained for weeks, was ignited on July 31 by a diesel-fueled vehicle 'emitting burning carbon from the exhaust system,' investigators said.</p>

<p>Area temperatures are expected to surpass 110 degrees near Yucaipa as Southern California is engulfed in a heatwave.</p>

<p>On Saturday, temperatures peaked at 122 degrees in Palm Springs and similar conditions were expected on Sunday, according to the National Weather Service.</p>

<p>The fire service said that 527 people were working to stop the fire, which has benefited from tinder-dry conditions</p>
