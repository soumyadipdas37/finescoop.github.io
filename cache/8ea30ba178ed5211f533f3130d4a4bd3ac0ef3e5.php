<p>Melbourne took its first tentative steps out of lockdown on Monday after a gruelling six weeks where residents have been confined to their homes.</p>

<p>Samantha Armytage has taken a sly dig at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews by claiming the Labor leader was 'playing politics in a pandemic'</p>

<p>A viewer messaged the Sunrise host on Wednesday morning, thanking her for being a 'breath of fresh air' by calling out 'things that don't make sense' on mainstream media</p>

<p>Those living alone or single parents are allowed to have one visitor, outdoor exercise is extended to two hours and the curfew's start time has been extended an hour to 9pm. </p>

<p>The Sunrise viewer messaged Armytage thanking her for being so honest about mental health and suicide stats on air.</p>

<p>'Honestly Sam, thank you. There are many people I know right now appreciative that you're calling out things that don't make sense and are un-Australian,' the fan wrote.</p>

<p>'It's like a breath of fresh air, a lot of people I know have been losing or have completely lost faith that certain things are not reported on properly to the public.</p>

<p>'Over the last few weeks especially I'm finding myself cheering at the tv things like 'Yes, Sam!'</p>

<p>Armytage shared a screenshot of the message to her Instagram where she had a sly dig at state leaders, in particular Victorian Premier Mr Andrews.</p>

<p>'In these crazy times, I will ALWAYS stick up for the Bush. And all of you out there,' the Sunrise host wrote.</p>

<p>'I will NEVER tolerate leaders playing politics in a pandemic.'</p>

<p>'And our mental health is a really serious issue. Perhaps now more than ever before. I WILL look at these issues beyond the sensational headlines.' </p>

<p>Victoria recorded just 42 new cases of coronavirus and eight deaths on Wednesday as regional Victoria is ramping up to return to Stage Two restrictions at 11.59pm.</p>

<p>Authorities are ramping up roadblocks, creating the so-called 'ring of steel' around Melbourne to ensure city residents do not try to take advantage of the eased regional measures.</p>

<p>Outdoor gathering limits in regional parts of the state will increase to 10 people from midnight on Thursday morning - as will weddings and outdoor religious gatherings.</p>

<p>Funerals will be allowed 20 mourners and regional Victorians can welcome five visitors from another nominated household.</p>

<p>Melbourne's lockdown rules remain unchanged and people cannot travel out of the city without specific reasons.</p>

<p>The premier said Melburnians should be inspired by the rolling back of restrictions, rather than disheartened.</p>

<p>'I'd encourage people not to see it that way and instead see this as proof positive,' he said.</p>

<p>The move comes after Mr Andrews was heavily criticised for a $290million plan to revive the state's crippled entertainment sector.</p>

<p>The under-fire premier unveiled a funding package on Monday to help the state's sole traders and entertainment industry survive when COVID-19 restrictions are lifted.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews said the plan would turn the city into an al fresco dining hub - but the head of Melbourne's largest restaurant group has already labelled the proposal unworkable.</p>

<p>'The government thinks this is going to be some sort of outdoor Disneyland for dining, but it's not going to work,' Luca Restaurants chief executive Chris Lucas told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews has meanwhile flagged regional Victoria may move to the 'third step' of its roadmap plan as early as this week.</p>

<p>That step, allowing people to leave their homes without restrictions and hospitality businesses to reopen, is triggered if its 14-day average remains below five and no 'mystery' cases are recorded.</p>

<p>'There won't be a lot of notice,' Mr Andrews told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>'That is preferable in making people wait for another week or so.</p>

<p>'Hopefully we can have very good news for regional Victoria tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Under the state government's plan, Melbourne's bars, cafes and restaurants can open for outdoor dining from October 26.</p>

<p>Melbourne will move to its next step of reopening on September 28 if the 14-day average falls to 30-50. </p>
