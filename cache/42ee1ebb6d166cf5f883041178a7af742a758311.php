<p>The marketing consultant's brunette locks were styled loosely around her face and shoulders, and her makeup was elegant. </p>

<p>Countdown: Pictures taken on July 13 at the mansion at Sydney's Oxford Falls, show Locky, 30, choosing his final three in the competition </p>

<p>Locking lips: The marketing professional enjoyed a steamy kiss with the Australian Survivor star</p>

<p>Bella appears to still be the frontrunner, pictured enjoying a steamy kiss with Locky in the grounds of the mansion.</p>

<p>She wrapped her arms around the Australian Survivor star, gazing into his eyes as they shared quality one-on-one time together. </p>

<p>Bella was also seen heading into the mansion, presumably for the rose ceremony.</p>

<p>Sheer daring: Bella's gown featured sheer fabric from the waist down, revealing her trim pins</p>

<p>Embrace: Bella wrapped her arms around Locky while in the mansion's gardens </p>

<p>Production team: Camera crew were there to capture every moment </p>

<p>Beauty: Bella's brunette locks were styled loosely around her face and shoulders, and her makeup was elegant </p>

<p>A production assistant used a large umbrella to conceal her face, however her dress was a clear giveaway. </p>

<p>Irena also appears to be one of the final three - a woman matching her description in a red beaded frock was seen entering the mansion.</p>

<p>Like Bella, she also used a large umbrella to hide her face.</p>

<p>Off to the rose ceremony? Bella was also seen being led to the front door of the mansion by a member of production </p>

<p>Prop: Production went to great lengths to ensure their faces were hidden</p>

<p>Safety first: Production wore protective face masks amid COVID-19 </p>

<p>Intricate: Bella's frock featured intricate detail at the back </p>

<p>Another contestant with blonde hair, perhaps intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25, was also pictured.</p>

<p>The beauty cut a glamorous figure in a beaded green gown and metallic heels, and were led into the mansion by a member of production.  </p>

<p>One other contestant in a black gown, possibly Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, was also seen entering the mansion.  </p>

<p>Tough decision: Locky appeared tense, perhaps after choosing his final three ladies </p>

<p>Familiar face: Locky crossed paths with the show's host Osher Günsberg (pictured) </p>

<p>Is that you, Irena? Another contestant in a red dress, presumably Irena Srbinovska, 31, was seen heading into the mansion </p>

<p>Hidden: The contestant was also given a large umbrella</p>

<p>Bella's sighting seemingly confirms her feud with Irena on Thursday's episode, does not see her being booted from the mansion.  </p>

<p>After weeks of tension, Irena pulled Bella aside for a private conversation to see if they could resolve their differences.</p>

<p>But it didn't take long for things to escalate, with Bella labelling Irena 'a manipulative little b***h', before storming off.</p>

<p>On the move: The starlet looked to have made her way over to the mansion's gardens </p>

<p>Arrival: Another contestant with blonde hair, presumably intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25, arrived at the mansion </p>

<p>Details: The contestant looked glamorous in their frock, which they teamed with metallic heels </p>

<p>Helping hand: Production were on hand to escort the ladies </p>

<p>After telling Irena she didn't trust her, Bella stood up and stormed off mid-conversation.</p>

<p>'Friendship done. I'm f<strong>king over your bulls</strong>t, to be honest! You're a manipulative little b**ch!' she shouted.</p>

<p>Irena confessed she was 'in complete and utter shock' at Bella's reaction, and agreed that their friendship was effectively over.</p>

<p>Tresses: The contestant's blonde curly locks could be seen underneath the umbrella </p>

<p>On the go: She looked to have made her way over to the mansion's gardens </p>

<p>Careful: The beauty picked up her dress with one hand, as she made her way across the mansion's grounds</p>

<p>Crew: A production member was on hand to help her with her dress </p>

<p>The show's fans appeared just as stunned as Irena, processing Bella's seemingly uncharacteristic meltdown on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Jeez, I thought Bella was a Disney Princess, I guess not,' tweeted one shocked fan, while another added, 'First time I haven't liked Bella. Overreaction much? Irena's taking over as No.1'. </p>

<p>Others compared Bella to Roxi Kenny, who quickly developed a reputation as the show's resident drama queen.  </p>

<p>Clothing: The starlet came prepared with sneakers and a statement top to change into </p>

<p>Outfit change: She was later seen in a pair of light blue jeans, the statement top and perspex heels </p>

<p>Looking good: Despite being in a less glamorous ensemble, she was still dressed to impress </p>

<p>Casual: Her curly tresses were visible as she made her way across the mansion's grounds. She also had changed into a pair of denim shorts </p>

<p>Comfy: She held onto a black jacket and changed into comfortable white sneakers </p>

<p>'Bella has somehow morphed into Roxi,' commented one viewer, while another tweeted, 'Man, Bella on #TheBachelorAU is really pulling a Roxi'.</p>

<p>Some fans thought Bella's reaction to Irena wanting to have a discussion reflected her maturity levels.</p>

<p>'Bella was my fave but now she just seems immature and selfish,' tweeted one fan, while another added, 'I'm getting flashbacks to year seven watching this'.   </p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.  </p>

<p>Sighting: One other contestant in a black gown, possibly Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, was also seen entering the mansion </p>

<p>Pulling out all the stops: Production went to great lengths to ensure her identity was hidden </p>
