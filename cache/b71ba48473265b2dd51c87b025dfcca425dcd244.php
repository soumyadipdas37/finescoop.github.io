<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A lone wolf bravely tried to steal a bear's kill from right under its nose, despite the grizzly's repeated efforts to scare off its opponent.</p>

<p>The grizzly bear at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, was tucking into its tasty meal when an intruding grey wolf tried to steal its kill on September 23.</p>

<p>The bear had buried the dead elk by the river's edge to cover the scent of the decaying carcass, but after a few days the wolves began to pick up on the scent.</p>

<p>And one courageous wolf decided to bravely approach the grizzly to try and steal its snack while the bear was napping, footage shows. </p>

<p>In the video, the daring canine calmly sniffs the ground next to where the bear is lying, seemingly unfazed by its proximity to the giant mammal.</p>

<p>A grizzly bear at Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, defended its hunted elk from a courageous wolf desperate to claim the snack for itself, video footage shows</p>

<p>The canine quietly sneaks towards the elk and manages to steal a few bites while the bear remains sleeping. </p>

<p>The bear quickly notices the intruding wolf's presence and leaps to its feet, sending the canine jumping backwards in fear.</p>

<p>But the grizzly surprisingly allows the predator to come extremely close to its kill before bothering to stand up and scare the canine away. </p>

<p>The head-to-head stand-off in the video continues for almost four minutes, with the plucky wolf still showing no signs of standing down from the fight. </p>

<p>Grey wolves, which can weigh up to 176lbs, are no match for the massive grizzly bear alone but can pose a threat in a pack.</p>

<p>The bear, which weighs up to 595lbs, are more powerful than wolves, but the canine  is considerably quicker than its opponent. </p>

<p>Speaking about the footage, the contributor said: '791 recently took down the elk in the Yellowstone river and proceeded to bury it on the rivers edge to cover the scent of the decaying carcass. However, after a few days the wolves began to pick up on it.</p>

<p>'This wolf was alone and therefore not much of a threat to the massive grizzly. It was more of a game to him to see how close the dominating bear would let him get to his kill. </p>

<p>In the tense stand-off, which took place on September 23, the lone wolf approaches the deceased elk while the bear sleeps next to its prey</p>

<p>The grizzly bear scares off the wolf when it gets too close to its kill, which it had hidden in the dirt to hide the scent from other predators</p>

<p>'To my surprise, as proven by this image, he let him get very close. The wolf would slowly approach, the bear would make a slight shift in position, and the wolf would back off for awhile. This cycle occurred 4 times in my watching.'</p>

<p>Grizzly bears are normally extremely protective of their prey and will fight off other bears and mammals who threaten to steal their hunts.</p>

<p>But bears often come head-to-head with wolves as the two predators often hunt the same sort of prey.</p>

<p>Grey wolves mostly hunt large, hoofed animals including deer, mountain goats and elk.</p>

<p>Grizzly bears, who have an omnivorous diet, eating plants, roots and grasses, they can also become effective predators and hunt newborn elk, moose and deer.</p>

<p>The breed of bear has a more adaptable diet than the carnivorous grey wolf, as they can also survive on fish, berries, small rodents - and even human garbage if available.</p>
