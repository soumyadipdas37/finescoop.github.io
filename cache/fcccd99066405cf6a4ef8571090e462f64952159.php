<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Queensland police are closing in on an elderly alleged dognapper who refused to give back an adorable corgi after pet-sitting her.</p>

<p>Gold Coast mother Carmen Pham and her family had to go to Vietnam in a hurry a few months ago, leaving their four-year-old Pembroke Welsh Corgi 'Haku' with an elderly couple who were family friends.</p>

<p>However when Ms Pham returned and asked for her dog back, the elderly couple asked to keep her for company during the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>Ms Pham let them keep Haku for a while, however when the lockdown lifted and she asked for her dog back, they refused.</p>

<p>In July, they disappeared and Ms Pham went to the police.</p>

<p>Ms Pham then found out that the couple had separated and the husband had taken Haku with him, leaving the worried mum with no idea how to get her back. </p>

<p>There is now hope that Carmen will be reunited with Haku as police have made a breakthrough in the investigation.</p>

<p>'After spending the afternoon with Southport Police, the investigation into Haku’s theft has progressed,' Carmen's family said in a statement on Facebook on Saturday.</p>

<p>'We look forward to being reunited with Haku very soon.</p>

<p>'We thank everyone for their support.'</p>

<p>Ms Pham told Daily Mail Australia on Monday that she had her fingers crossed that the elderly man would soon return her dog.</p>

<p>'I'll just try to be positive and await for Haku to be returned,' she said. </p>

<p>Haku the four-year-old Pembroke Welsh corgi disappeared along with an elderly family friend who was her pet-sitter during the pandemic lockdown, leaving Carmen Pham in tears</p>

<p>Carmen Pham's heart was broken after Haku disappeared.  </p>

<p>Ms Pham said she had trusted the elderly man who was a friend of the family and always seemed kind.  </p>

<p>But when Carmen started asking for her dog back, he would not return her. </p>

<p>'After the lockdown I did approach and said: 'hey maybe you should get my dog back, it's after lockdown',' Ms Pham told Nine News Queensland. </p>

<p>When she persisted, the man allegedly told Carmen he wanted to keep Haku - and then disappeared with the dog. </p>

<p>On Facebook, Carmen said he had left his residential address in Labrador on the  Gold Coast, in July.</p>

<p>'(He) was found in Chevron Island last week but has now gone into hiding again,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Distraught, Ms Pham told Nine News that she felt he had played on her sympathy.</p>

<p>'You need to return my Haku - I can't take it anymore it's taking so much toll on me,' she said.</p>

<p>Haku, who Carmen affectionately calls 'my little fatty', went missing in July, and is microchipped and registered to Ms Pham as the owner.</p>

<p>On Facebook, Carmen told a friend how she had feared for her dog.</p>

<p>The post that went viral on Facebook, being shared more than 745 times in just three days</p>

<p>'He’s on the run now with Haku too. So I’m also worried for her safety,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Ms Pham posted a plea for her dog's return on the Missing &amp; Stolen Pets QLD Facebook page last Thursday night and it was quickly shared more than 745 times by outraged pet-lovers. </p>

<p>Kirilly Cull, from the Missing &amp; Stolen Pets QLD Facebook page, said the police had found the person who 'stole Haku'.</p>

<p>'He has now gone into hiding,' she said.</p>

<p>The man who took Haku told Nine News he did not steal the dog, he thought she had been left with him permanently. </p>

<p>However Missing &amp; Stolen Pets page administrators wrote on Friday that they had copies of all conversations between the 'persons of interest' and the legal owners as well as a copy of the police report.</p>

<p>'Hand Haku into a vet, pound or police. Keeping an animal that is legally not yours is deemed under Australian law 'theft of property',' they wrote, but all in capital letters.  </p>

<p>Pictures of Haku have also been posted to the Instagram page of the dog-napper's new girlfriend, the Missing &amp; Stolen Pets QLD Facebook Page reported on Saturday.</p>
