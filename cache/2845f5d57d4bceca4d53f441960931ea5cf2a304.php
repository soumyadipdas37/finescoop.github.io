<p>The 56-year-old BBC staple took over from David Dimbleby to become the first female host of the political show Question Time last year.</p>

<p>Successful career: Fiona Bruce has admitted that she 'didn't expect to be working' at her age as she discusses her presenting roles in a candid new interview</p>

<p>When asked if there was anything she still wanted to achieve in her career, she told The Radio Times: </p>

<p>'Not at the moment. There should be. But you know, I'm 56 and I didn't expect to be working at this age. Things have improved in that sense.'</p>

<p>The Antiques Roadshow star also admitted that she 'rarely' looks at social media due to abuse from trolls about her appearance and alleged BBC bias. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two said: 'I rarely look at Twitter because that way can lie madness. But my husband did once show me two consecutive tweets: one said, ''Fiona Bruce is to the left of Trotsky'' and the next one said, ''Fiona Bruce has virtually turned this programme into a Conservative Party Broadcast'.'</p>

<p>TV favourite: The 56-year-old BBC staple took over from David Dimbleby to become the first female host of the political show Question Time last year</p>

<p>'So I have that in a little frame on my desk.' </p>

<p>The TV favourite also revealed her regret at not intervening on Question Time during a debate over Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Welsh actor John Rhys-Davies, known for his role as Gimli in Lord Of The Rings, exclaimed 'Oh woman!' at former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas and slapped his palms on the table in the discussion last year.</p>

<p>'I thought at the time, I should shut him down, and say, 'That is not how we say things here,'' Bruce said.</p>

<p>'We film the show as live and I always watch it back - which I don't do with the news any more - to see if there is anything I should have done differently, and on that occasion I should have done.'</p>
