<p>Former flame: Vanessa previously dated actor Johnny for 14 years and they have two children, and had been expected to give evidence in support of the actor's case over a videolink</p>

<p>But the court was told that there was no need for her - or his ex-fiancee in the 1990s, actress Winona Ryder - to give evidence because Depp's claim that he has never hit a woman was only tested by the defence regarding Amber Heard.</p>

<p>However their bombshell statements were released by the court, showing both stood faithfully by his side. Winona said she was 'absolutely shocked, confused and upset' by the allegations against him.</p>

<p>She added in her statement, provided in advance of the trial: 'The idea that he is an incredibly violent person is the farthest thing from the Johnny I knew and loved.</p>

<p>'I cannot wrap my head around these accusations. He was never, never violent towards me. He was never, never abusive at all towards me. He has never been violent or abusive towards anybody I have seen,' she added.</p>

<p>Johnny is suing The Sun publisher News Group Newspapers (NGN) and its executive editor over an April 2018 article which alleged he was violent towards ex-wife Amber, 34, during their tumultuous relationship.</p>

<p>Supportive: Despite no longer needing to give evidence, Vanessa's statement was released by the court, and clearly showed her support for her ex</p>
