<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brighton welcome Manchester United to the Amex Stadium this afternoon in Premier League action as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's men look to bounce back from their 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace.  </p>

<p>United finished last season in flying form, with the influence of Bruno Fernandes key in guiding the Red Devils into the Premier League top four.  </p>

<p>However, Solskjaer's side looked miles away from the team that ended the league campaign as one of the in-form sides in England. They'll be hoping to get up and running this afternoon but face a tough challenge in Brighton, who were fantastic in their last league outing at Newcastle, winning 3-0. </p>

<p>Sportsmail's OLLIE LEWIS will provide live Premier League coverage of Brighton vs Man United including score, lineups and build-up, with the action set to get under way at 12.30pm BST. </p>
