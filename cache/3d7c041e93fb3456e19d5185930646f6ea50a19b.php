<p>Torrential rain swept across central and western Queensland over the weekend with more than 100mm falling in some areas.</p>

<p>Grazier Andrea Curro had 80mm fall at her property near Longreach since Friday, with aerial photos showing flooded areas throughout.</p>

<p>After having no rain since January, Ms Curro said it is the most rainfall they saw in over a year.</p>

<p>'It went from literally being a barren wasteland to 3.5 inches of rain,' she told The Courier Mail.</p>

<p>'For a couple of days it just looks like an ocean.'</p>

<p>Ms Curro said it was a huge relief after living through months of drought, with the rainfall setting her up for summer. </p>

<p>Longreach resident Jenna Goodman said the rain had been 'quite heavy at times' over the weekend.</p>

<p>'I think outside of town got more than we did in town which is nice. Not a flood by any means, but hopefully we get some good follow up rain,' she said.</p>

<p>The rainfall comes as the Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert saying there is a 70 per cent chance of La Nina developing this year, bringing cooler temperatures and above average rainfall.</p>

<p>Increased rainfall and cloudiness means above average spring rainfall for the east and north, raising the risk of flooding in some parts with wetter soils bringing milder daytime temperatures.</p>

<p>'We can also see an earlier start to the tropical cyclone season,' a BOM spokeswoman said. </p>

<p>The six wettest winter-spring periods on record for eastern Australia occurred during La Nina years.</p>

<p>In the Murray-Darling Basin, winter/spring rainfall averaged over all 18 La Nina events since 1900 was 22 per cent higher than the long-term average, with the severe floods of 1955, 1988, 1998 and 2010 all associated with La Nina.</p>

<p>Unlike El Nino years, the impacts of La Nina often continued into the warm months, the BOM said. </p>

<p>In eastern Australia, the average December-March rainfall during La Nina years is 20 per cent higher than the long-term average, with eight of the ten wettest such periods occurring during La Nina years.</p>

<p>Ms Curro said it was a huge relief after living through months of drought, with the rainfall setting her up for summer</p>

<p>The east coast, which tends to be less affected by La Nina during the winter months, can experience severe flooding during La Nina summers.</p>

<p>Of the 18 La Nina events since 1900, 12 resulted in floods, with the east coast experiencing twice as many severe floods during La Nina years than El Nino years.</p>

<p>Some areas of northern Australia typically experience flooding during La Nina because of an increase in tropical cyclone numbers.</p>

<p>The wettest years on record for Australia occurred during the strong 2010-2012 and 1974 La Nina events with the 2010-12 La Nina event bringing widespread flooding across Australia.         </p>

<p>El Niño and La Niña are the warm and cool phases (respectively) of a recurring climate phenomenon across the tropical Pacific - the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, or 'ENSO' for short.</p>

<p>The pattern can shift back and forth irregularly every two to seven years, and each phase triggers predictable disruptions of temperature, winds and precipitation. </p>

<p>These changes disrupt air movement and affect global climate. </p>

<p>ENSO has three phases it can be: </p>
