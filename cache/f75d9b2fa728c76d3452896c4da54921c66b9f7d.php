<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Detergent giant Persil has switched its bottles to 100 per cent recyclable plastic and has ditched the controversial 'dosing ball'. </p>

<p>The plastic ball, a small bowl detaching from the main bottle, had come under fire from environmentalists on social media for adding to the landfill. </p>

<p>Every new bottle came with a new 'dosing ball' attached to it, despite it being argued that nobody needed more than one.  </p>

<p>Persil has now ditched it from the new containers, which the company estimates will save an estimated 1,000 tonnes of plastic a year. </p>

<p>Persil has started using bottles made from 100 per cent recyclable plastic for its washing detergent</p>

<p>For those who want one or something similar, they can be ordered online. </p>

<p>The new bottles have been made with 'post-consumer recycled plastic' and the new ingredients for the liquid now contain plant-based stain removers and biodegradable ingredients from sustainable sources. </p>

<p>The bottles are now smaller as the product is more concentrated, which cuts the amount of lorries needed to transport them by 19 per cent, Persil parent company Unilever said. </p>

<p>The moves, revealed by trade journal The Grocer, are part of Unilever's billion-dollar global 'Clean Future' programme. </p>

<p>Consumer companies are trying to improve their green credentials in the wake of growing environmental awareness amid growing concerns over waste. </p>

<p>Unilever's UK vice president of homecare Charlie Beevor said: 'Clean Future is our vision to transform the sustainability of our global cleaning and laundry brands, which has already begun with Persil. </p>

<p>They're also ditching the plastic 'dosing' ball which came with every new bottle, which environmentalists on social media said was adding to landfill</p>

<p>'As an industry, we must break out dependence on fossil fuels and we're proud to be leading the charge. </p>

<p>'We know that people want good-value products that deliver performance and are also sustainable.</p>

<p>'We believe there should be no compromise between quality and our planet when buying products.</p>

<p>'Our new Persil Liquid is just the start of providing products that are both effective and kind to the planet.' </p>
