<p>Sensational summer body: Miley Cyrus put it on display this Tuesday as she posed up in a cherry red crop top for a picture taken by Ali Tamposi</p>

<p>She appeared to have cut a chunk off a vintage T-shirt that read: 'VICIOUS, EVIL, MEAN &amp; NASTY...but basically mellow.'</p>

<p>The picture was posted by songwriter Ali Tamposi who was one of the people that helped pen Miley's new single Midnight Sky.</p>

<p>Released one month ago today, the number will be featured on Miley's next album She Is Miley Cyrus which has not yet had its release date made public. </p>

<p>Radiant: Miley also made sure to also bring the party to her own Insta Stories, sizzling up a storm in slinky skintight leather trousers during her 'Studio daze'</p>

<p>During a recent interview on the Australian radio show Fitzy &amp; Wippa she dished about the night out drinking that helped influence Midnight Sky.</p>

<p>Miley, who announced in June that she was six months sober, was referring to the lyric: 'Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's tellin' me to go home.'</p>

<p>The evening out that inspired the number occurred after 'I went and performed at the Morrison hotel anniversary with The Doors.'</p>

<p>She shared: 'I ended up going out that night, and I went to take a picture because there was so many icons, Billy Idol, all these legends.'</p>

<p>Singing up a storm: Ali helped write Miley's new single Midnight Sky which is slated to appear on her next album She Is Miley Cyrus</p>

<p>Miley confessed: ''I go to take a picture, and it was on selfie-style. With all this partying, I looked horrible, sweaty and flat, mascara dripping down my face and I thought: "Well, it's time to go home!"'</p>

<p>Around the time the number was released Miley confirmed on Instagram that she had called it quits with her 23-year-old Australian beau Cody Simpson.</p>

<p>The duo were longtime pals and Miley was even pictured attending Cody's star-studded 18th birthday bash. </p>

<p>Ringing in the week: Miley showed her exes what they are missing declaring that she 'Had a f***in wicked weekend now....It's Mon-YAY let's get it'</p>

<p>'Miley is one of my best friends and she helps with some of that transitional stuff - trying to escape your childhood,' Cody told GQ Australia that year.</p>

<p>Her split from Cody came a year after her split from her husband Liam Hemsworth, whom she was married to for about nine months.</p>

<p>After she separated from Liam she had a whirlwind summer romance from Kaitlynn Carter who had herself recently split from reality TV dreamboat Brody Jenner. </p>
