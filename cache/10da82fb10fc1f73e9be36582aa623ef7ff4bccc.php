<p>I can reveal the 26-year-old is defying the economic crisis by opening his first restaurant next week: Luccio's, in Dorchester, Dorset.</p>

<p>'It's classic Italian at affordable prices with friendly service,' Luciano tells me. The £5.50 meatballs will be named after his paternal grandmother, Maria Rosa.</p>

<p>Fiery Marco Pierre White became the first Briton to be awarded three Michelin stars, and now his younger son, Luciano (pictured), is cooking up his own recipe for success</p>

<p>I can reveal the 26-year-old (pictured with his father) is defying the economic crisis by opening his first restaurant next week: Luccio's, in Dorchester, Dorset</p>

<p>'I worked with Pierre Koffmann in London, the Adria brothers in Barcelona, and [Marco's] The English House in Singapore,' he says. </p>

<p>He spent countless hours in the kitchen with his dad, who taught Gordon Ramsay before starring in such hit programmes as Hell's Kitchen.</p>

<p>Straight-talking Marco says: 'He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, and he's very good with money.'</p>

<p>Scots comic Billy Connolly prefers the treatment he receives from fans in Florida, where he lives with his wife, Pamela Stephenson, and doesn't get pestered for selfies.</p>

<p>'It happens everywhere, except America,' he says. 'You can be in a restaurant and there's a table full of people next to you. </p>

<p>You'll be talking to your wife and this table will get up, walk to the door, and as they're going out they'll look over and give you a little salute. It's a very pleasant thing. They know who you are but they leave you alone.'</p>

<p>Who needs Netflix? While Prince Harry and Meghan are flush with cash from the television streaming giant, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are super-charging their Royal Foundation with a hat-trick of eye-catching appointments.</p>

<p>Not only have they appointed BBC newsreader Zeinab Badawi to be a director, I hear they've also recruited Alice Webb, who was in charge of BBC children's television and is now boss of DVD giant Eagle Rock Entertainment. </p>

<p>Helping to give Prince William and Kate's charity a new global reach will be former foreign secretary William Hague, who will also be a director.</p>

<p>'William and Catherine are very much focused on their charitable efforts,' a friend tells me.</p>

<p>Fancy owning one of London's most spectacular party pads? I hear that PR supremo Matthew Freud, who inspired Matthew Macfadyen's character Tom in acclaimed U.S. drama Succession, is looking to sell his Primrose Hill home. </p>

<p>Everyone from Tony Blair to Hollywood stars has been entertained at the property, which includes a courtyard patio that, at the press of a button, opens up to become a swimming pool.</p>

<p>The house is likely to be valued at more than £20 million, but Freud, who was married to Rupert Murdoch's daughter Elisabeth, insists he's in no rush to sell, telling me he's 'not very actively' marketing it.</p>

<p>Perhaps Macfadyen might put in an offer?</p>

<p>She played ill-fated Fantine in the BBC's acclaimed adaptation of Les Miserables, but Lily Collins is enjoying a happy ending in real life.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend, the Hollywood director Charlie McDowell, went down on bended knee yesterday during a trip to the mountains from her home in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old daughter of pop star Phil Collins accepted McDowell's proposal, later telling him online: 'I've been waiting my lifetime for you and I can't wait to spend our lifetime together.'</p>

<p>Surrey-born Lily, whose mother is Phil's American second wife Jill Tavelman, has been courted by Charlie for a year. </p>

<p>Charlie, 36, whose parents are A Clockwork Orange star Malcom McDowell and Oscar winner Mary Steenburgen, replied: 'I will forever cherish my adventure with you.'</p>

<p>Beatlemania didn't go out with the Sixties.</p>

<p>Keira Knightley has revealed her daughter, Delilah, has become 'obsessed' with The Beatles at the tender age of five — and is besotted with 78-year-old Sir Paul McCartney.</p>

<p>'It is really obsessive,' says the Atonement star, who is married to rocker James Righton. 'She knows all of the four films.</p>

<p>'I am a fan of The Beatles, but the films are not that great, but we watch them on a loop. Hard Day's Night — she knows all the words.</p>

<p>'Paul McCartney is her big one. Every time he comes on the screen she just screams.'</p>

<p>Under fire for blundering into U.S. politics, Prince Harry has at least won a vote of confidence back home from Boris Johnson. </p>

<p>I hear the charity the Duke of Sussex set up to help injured former servicemen and women, the Invictus Games Foundation, has been awarded £57,000 by the Government's Office for Veterans' Affairs. </p>

<p>'The Invictus Games have been a fantastic way of supporting our Forces,' a source tells me.</p>

<p>What should you do when the person you meet through a dating app turns out to be someone else entirely?</p>

<p>Saucy television chef Gizzi Erskine admits she had one such mix-up when using the members-only Raya. 'I thought I was going out with Orlando from The Maccabees,' says the daughter of the late Lord Erskine of Rerrick. 'I'd just read 'Orlando', and I was like, 'Brilliant!'</p>

<p>'I'd fancied him for years. I turned up and it was someone half my age from another band — who will remain nameless.'</p>

<p>Rather than playing it cool, she admits: 'I literally lay on the floor, p***ing myself in hysterics. I texted my friend saying, 'How do I get out of this?' I had a drink. He was very sweet.'</p>

<p>Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch might have detected something curious when an ambulance arrived at a family wedding yesterday.</p>

<p>Happily, it was an auspicious start to proceedings, as it was carrying the woman due to marry his brother-in-law.</p>

<p>Patrick Hunter, whose sister is Benedict's theatre director wife Sophie, wed Gemma Taylor, a fellow paramedic — which is what inspired the bride's unusual entrance.</p>

<p>Benedict and Sophie's sons, Christopher, five, and Hal, three, were pageboys at the ceremony at The Orleans House Gallery in Twickenham, South-West London. Due to Covid rules, the boys didn't attend the evening reception at a nearby hotel.</p>

<p>Benedict, however, made use of his thespian talents by delivering a heart-warming speech. </p>
