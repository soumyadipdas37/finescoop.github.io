<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Billionaire Ron Perelman has reportedly continued to downsize his belongings this month with his 57-acre mansion in East Hampton.</p>

<p>The affluent American banker is reportedly considering offers for his sprawling, palatial home dubbed 'The Creeks' for about $180million, sources to New York Post.</p>

<p>A Perelman spokesperson told the publication that luxurious estate, which sits right near Georgica Pond and is shrouded in privacy, was not for sale 'officially or unofficially.'</p>

<p>But brokers linked to wealthy clients have reportedly gotten indications from Perelman insiders that the property may be available as a 'whisper' listing.</p>

<p>The New York Post reported that Ron Perelman, the billionaire chairman to Revlon, is entertaining offers for his East Hampton home (pictured)</p>

<p>Sources told NY Post that Perelman's (pictured) East Hampton estate may be available to some as a 'whisper' listing</p>

<p>'The Creeks,' is one of the largest estates in the Hamptons, which has an average household income estimated at $155,649 and a median household income of $100,474. </p>

<p>In East Hampton, the US Census reported that the per capita income in 2018 was $68,386. </p>

<p>Perelman, the 77-year-old Chairman of Revlon, has hosted a plethora of celebrities from Jon Bon Jovi to Jennifer Hudson perform at the estate for his annual Apollo in the Hamptons bash. </p>

<p>The floors are still splattered with paint drippings from the legendary artist Jackson Pollack from when 'The Creeks' was much more of an artists colony. </p>

<p>Although noted for it's gorgeous exterior and appeal, the home took some damage two years ago when an attic fire sparked. </p>

<p>The East Hampton home was the site of Perelman's (pictured)  annual Apollo in the Hamptons event where celebrities performed </p>

<p>Perelman was not home at the time and, fortunately, no one was injured by the frightening inferno. The fire was contained to the third-floor of the home.</p>

<p>It appeared that Perelman's extensive art collection remained unscathed. His collection includes pieces by the famous Andy Warhol and sculptures from Jeff Koons.</p>

<p>A source told NY Post that there could be multiple reasons for the alleged home sale.</p>

<p>'He was sick and had an operation on his leg. Maybe this is part of estate planning. You just don’t know. But this is a pre-vaccine Covid market and the impact and reach of it is worldwide,' they said. </p>

<p>His daughter Samantha, from his second wife and Page Six editor Claudia Cohen, has also reportedly offered up her beautiful East Hampton mansion for $150million.</p>

<p>The estate, which is nestled on 8.5 acres, is where Samantha celebrated her 30th birthday and lived during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>NY Post reports that Perelman's daughter, Samantha (right), also listed her East Hampton home for sale </p>

<p>The home has 'all the bells and whistles' like a tennis court, pool and spacious lawn, sources told NY Post.</p>

<p>'I was supposed to see it yesterday but it was raining — and it is way overpriced,' said one broker.</p>

<p>The supposed sale comes as the businessman continued to do away with his assets amid gossiping from Wall Street to Washington D.C. about the fairly recent decision.</p>

<p>He sold his enormous 70 per cent stake in Humvee maker AM General last July, in addition to his $37.3million auction for paintings by Joan Miro and Henri Matisse.</p>

<p>Perelman sought help from Goldman Sachs in 2019 to 'explore strategic alternatives' for Revlon's finances after $3billion in loans was due.  </p>

<p>He's also reportedly considered to drop his 39 per cent share in Scientific Games, which provides gambling products to casinos, and Perelman has already sold The Independent, a popular East Hampton paper in June.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Perelman's net worth has plummeted from $20million in 2018 to $4.55billion,NY Post reports.</p>

<p>Perelman, pictured with singer Ciara (right), said in a Vanity Fair statement that he is downsizing to focus on a simpler way of life</p>

<p>But Perelman has attempted to quiet rumors last month with a rare statement published in Vanity Fair, where he explained that he wanted a 'less complicated and less leveraged business life.'</p>

<p>That 'would allow me to focus on what I love most about MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Inc., seek new investment opportunities, as well as allow me to have better and more present time with my family,' he said.</p>

<p>'A simpler life, with less running around and more time with my family, including homeschooling our youngest children, has energized me and taught me new things. </p>

<p>'For the future, I will spend my time more with my family and all my children, seeking new investment opportunities, and running our companies.'      </p>
