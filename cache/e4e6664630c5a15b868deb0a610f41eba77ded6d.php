<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jim Crowley reached a major milestone at Goodwood as he secured his 2,000th career winner in Britain aboard Modmin.</p>

<p>The former champion jockey enjoyed a memorable Ebor Festival at York, with six winners highlighted by sprint sensation Battaash's Nunthorpe victory as part of a fabulous Friday four-timer.</p>

<p>He needed two more winners for his landmark heading into a new week, and suffered a few frustrating days before getting Zahratty home at Newmarket on Saturday.</p>

<p>Jim Crowley reached a milestone at Goodwood as he secured his 2,000th career winner</p>

<p>The Marcus Tregoning-trained Modmin looked to hold every chance of giving Crowley his milestone, and so it proved as the 30-100 favourite made all in the Ladbrokes Supporting 'Children With Cancer UK' Novice Stakes.</p>

<p>Crowley said: 'I was thinking I had maybe used up all my luck!</p>

<p>'It has been a fantastic season so far and I hope it continues. It was nice to do it here as it's my local track. I've got a lot of fond memories here and to ride it in these colours for Marcus was nice.</p>

<p>'There's been a couple of rides that have given me great satisfaction. The first one that sticks in my memory is winning the Eclipse on Ulysses.</p>

<p>'I'd lost the ride on Eminent and to get the ride for Sir Michael Stoute, who is a legend of a trainer - to get up and win was special.</p>

<p>The Marcus Tregoning-trained Modmin held every chance of giving Crowley his milestone</p>

<p>'Battaash at York was a highlight the first year and Mohaather winning in the fashion he did in such a good race here (Sussex Stakes), those three really stick out for me and it is hard to pick one.'</p>

<p>It is 14 years since the former northern-based jumps rider switched codes.</p>

<p>Exactly a decade later, he was crowned Britain's champion Flat jockey - before being appointed number one rider to one of the sport's most prominent owners in Sheikh Hamdan Al Maktoum.</p>

<p>Crowley added: 'It is massive (becoming retained rider for Sheikh Hamdan). I felt very fortunate to get the job. When I was champion jockey that probably got me noticed. It is a dream come true and touch wood it is going well.'</p>

<p>That association has borne great fruit, never more so than this season as Crowley dominated Royal Ascot with a string of winners in the blue and white before heading to Goodwood in similar form, and then on to York.</p>

<p>Battaash has been pre-eminent among his big-race winners since racing resumed in June, adding a fourth King George Stakes in record time at Goodwood to his King's Stand at Ascot, en route to York.</p>

<p>Mohaather, Nazeef, Hukum and Enbihaar all kept Crowley centre stage at Group level too - among others this summer.</p>

<p>Crowley said: 'I was thinking I had maybe used up all my luck!' after victory at his local track</p>

<p>Their names are famous additions to a roll of honour which began when Karl Burke's Lord Shanakill provided his first Group One breakthrough in the 2009 Prix Jean Prat.</p>

<p>Before then, there was a smattering of big handicap and lesser Group-race success for a variety of trainers.</p>

<p>Crowley had first made a name for himself, however, on the northern jumps circuit - with the odd foray south.</p>

<p>On one such, Mark Rimell's Crossbow Creek became one of his highest-profile National Hunt winners in the Lanzarote Hurdle.</p>

<p>It has been a long, highly successful road from Kempton in January to Goodwood in late August - but 15 years on, Crowley is surely far from done yet.</p>
