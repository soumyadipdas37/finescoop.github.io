<p>It comes after Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 19, came under fire once again on Sunday's TOWIE, as they were hit with more accusations of bullying Chloe. </p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter to describe how they felt 'uncomfortable' watching the trio throw insults at their much younger cast mate.</p>

<p>When Chloe asked Olivia why she called her a 'poisonous little creature', the former Love Island star replied: 'I thought you was vile and poisonous. You went at Clelia last year like a Jack Russell.</p>

<p>'I do feel a bit sorry for you, you haven't got any friends your own age, you're hanging around girls a lot older than you and you're angry. I don't know why you're so angry but you are. </p>

<p>'The thing is I thought the other day "maybe was what I said a little bit too harsh" but the way you've conducted yourself, I'm bang on.'</p>

<p>Chloe told her: 'All I'm saying is, when you called me a 'poisonous little creature', you don't know me'.</p>

<p>Olivia interrupted: 'I do know you, I know loads about you. I've seen the way you treated my friend.  </p>

<p>'Your mum Claire what does she pay you an hour to babysit you? Because I would like to know', to which the other two girls sniggered.   </p>

<p>The argument reached fever pitch when they continued to throw insults about each others' age, Chloe calling Olivia a 'lanky old troll' while Nicole called Chloe 'young' and 'stupid'. </p>

<p>Olivia went further: 'You come here with Victoria Beckham's wig on'.</p>
