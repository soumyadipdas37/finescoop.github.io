<p>However today's interview saw the couple reveal perhaps their most distinctive feature in their home as yet, a set of three $360 black-and-white prints of birds nests. </p>

<p>The prints are from Californian Barloga Studios, a photography and print studio owned by father-son duo Dennis and Roy Barloga.  </p>

<p>The brand specialise in 'nature' images, with the Duke and Duchess selecting three of the Nest Studies prints, which cost $360 each, for their living space. </p>

<p>The three frames on show in Prince Harry and Meghan's home are likely snaps taken by Roy, who specialises in  infrared photographs and is best known for his series of 'trilogies' that span a wide variety of subjects.</p>

<p>According to their website, the duo are currently combining their talents to 'make prints on a variety of 'unphotographic' substrates' including handmade paper, film, wood, and fabric.</p>

<p>The couple have framed their huge nest prints in the brand's  frameless leather and steel hangers which are described online as 'offering an easy and inexpensive way to display our prints without the hassle of custom framing'.     </p>

<p>The trendy industrial style frames cost $50 a pop. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess spoke from their sprawling nine-bedroom and 16-bathroom mansion in upscale Santa Barbara which they share with their son Archie. </p>

<p>The mansion is known as 'The Chateau' for $14.65million on June 18, making them neighbors with celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres, according to DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the couple revealed another piece of artwork in their home which underlined their love of America, when the Duchess of Sussex made her latest Zoom appearance with a framed print entitled 'I Love You, California' behind her.</p>

<p>The couple previously revealed another piece of artwork in their home,  the title of the work is the anthem of her home US state. Published in 1913, the tune was adopted by the sunshine state in 1951 and confirmed in 1987 as its official song</p>

<p>Today the couple spoke out to demand an end to 'structural racism' in Britain.</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging interview from their California mansion, Prince Harry revealed his 'awakening' to issues faced by black people after meeting his wife. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Meghan Markle praised Black Lives Matter protests in America after the death of George Floyd as 'beautiful' - but said this only applied to 'peaceful protest' and admitted many people found them 'inflammatory'. </p>

<p>Speaking from their home today, the couple spoke out to demand an end to 'structural racism' in Britain.</p>

<p>Speaking on Zoom to the Evening Standard, Harry also weighed on Diversity's controversial BLM dance routine on Britain's Got Talent and said he was 'surprised' by the negative comments it had received.</p>

<p>In an article for the newspaper, the couple said: 'As long as structural racism exists, there will be generations of young people of colour who do not start their lives with the same equality of opportunity as their white peers. And for as long as that continues, untapped potential will never get to be realised.'</p>

<p>The interview is the latest in a long series of political interventions by the couple, including last week when Harry weighed in on the US election by urging voters to 'reject hate speech'.</p>

<p>The comments - which broke royal protocol - were widely interpreted as a call to vote out Donald Trump, and prompted Buckingham Palace to immediately distance themselves from Harry by noting he was 'not working member of the Royal Family'. </p>

<p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry showed off their distinctive bird nest artwork from Californian brand Barloga Studios during an interview in which they discussed racism today. </p>

<p>But the couple have also revealed several glimpses into their royal mansion.</p>

<p>Last week, The Duchess of Sussex, 39, made a surprise appearance on the season finale of the talent show to send a video message to singer Archie Williams, 59, a humble man who had been wrongly incarcerated for 36 years. </p>

<p>The royal spoke from the same plush living room, offering a sneak peek into the private life of the Duke and Duchess and the objects and personal treasures they hold dear including feminist titles and books on race. </p>

<p>It's not the first time the Duchess of Sussex has revealed her living room to the world, having previously appeared from the space on America's Got Talent </p>

<p>The Duchess has long favoured mid-century modern furniture and a white colour palette, and added vibrant pops of colour with accessories such as a huge bouquet of flowers.</p>

<p>Her lavish home shows her love for white furnishings and luxury accents such as a the striped black-and-white cushions thrown on the sofa. </p>

<p>Despite having two dogs with muddy paws and a young toddler, the royals have bravely opted for a white couch in their living space.</p>

<p>It appears to offer a place in the room to relax and recline when not working, or perhaps a space to take meetings. </p>

<p>Meghan has always been a fan of fresh flowers,  with  pink peonies declared as her favourite. </p>

<p>The sideboard is decorated with several candles, including the £47 Diptyque Tubereuse candle, which is described online as 'sensual, generous and luscious' and 'full of the heady and intoxicating fragrance derived from the sought-after Mexican white flower'.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, the Duchess appeared from a different corner of her sofa for a virtual summit </p>

<p>According to it's online description, it can 'create an elegant ambience in the home for any occasion.'</p>

<p>The scented candle may be another piece selected by the Duchess, who has long been a fan of the brand. </p>

<p>She was known to have selected the Diptyque's Figuier, with fresh wood, green notes and crushed fig leaves, for her home in Toronto. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess have artfully arranged books around the room, but turned one into a design features by perching them underneath several black decorative bowls.</p>

<p>Meghan performed a similar styling trick while working as an actress in Suits and living at her Toronto home. </p>

<p>Meghan and Prince Harry's reading taste can clearly be seen displayed to the right of the image, where there is several books perched in a decorative pile.</p>

<p>Books include hardback Wood And Iron: Industrial Interiors, which offers a guide to those wanting to decorate their home in the distinctive style, and The Black Godfather, which depicts the story of music executive Clarence Avant, told by the people he worked with.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Duke and Duchess also have a perchant for celebrity photographers, with several portrait books decorating their sideboard, including A Photographer's Life: 1990-2005 by Annie Leibovitz and Marc Hom's Profiles.  </p>
