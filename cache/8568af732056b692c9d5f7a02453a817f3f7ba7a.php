<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Italian wonderkid Sandro Tonali has turned down the likes of Manchester United and Barcelona to sign for AC Milan this summer, according to Brescia president Massimo Cellino.</p>

<p>Tonali is poised to put pen to paper on a deal with the San Siro club, bringing to an end the Europe-wide pursuit for his services which has seen every elite club linked.</p>

<p>And now Cellino has admitted that United and Barca had posted serious interest in the 20-year-old, who appeared set for Inter Milan before turning everybody down once their bitter rivals AC made interest known. </p>

<p>Sandro Tonali will finally move on this summer and is poised to sign for AC Milan</p>

<p>Brescia president Massimo Cellino revealed Manchester United were among the hopefuls</p>

<p>'I know that [Inter CEO] Beppe Marotta really wanted Tonali, and that [Inter head coach] Antonio Conte appreciated him, so I think his agent had agreed terms with Inter,' Cellino told Top Calcio24. </p>

<p>'As soon as Milan showed real interest, he did not want to listen to any other options. </p>

<p>'I also have a historically good rapport with Milan and we reached an agreement with [Milan technical director] Paolo Maldini quite quickly.</p>

<p>'We also had interest from Barcelona and Manchester United, but the lad is in love with Milan and went crazy once he heard of their offer, because he supports them.'</p>

<p>It's back to the drawing board for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after being snubbed by the starlet</p>

<p>Huge things are expected of Tonali in his homeland, with the player repeatedly compared against the iconic Andrea Pirlo. </p>

<p>The financial deal for Tonali looks set to be a staggered one, with AC Milan initially paying a sizeable loan fee before committing to purchasing the player thereafter.</p>

<p>Milan's initial outlay on the loan will cost €10m (£9m) with an option to then buy for a further €15m (£13m) and another €10m in potential add-ons thereafter once a series of clauses are met.</p>
