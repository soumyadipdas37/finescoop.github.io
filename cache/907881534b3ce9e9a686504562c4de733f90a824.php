<p>Australian mining company BHP announced on Tuesday it will create almost 4,000 jobs to help rebuild the nation's economy.</p>

<p>BHP committed $30million to the regional program with an eye towards training for future job demand. </p>

<p>Apprentices and trainees could find themselves working at any of the more than 20 BHP sites across the country. </p>

<p>A further $450million will be invested in contracts with Mining Equipment, Technology and Services (METS) companies in Australia.</p>

<p>The almost half a billion dollars will be used to source local products and services, as well as investing in technology pilot programs and emerging businesses.  </p>

<p>Mr Henry said BHP recognised the important role the mining industry played as Australia's biggest export earner, employing hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>In the 2020 financial year the company contributed almost $33.4 billion to the economy through jobs, suppliers, taxes, royalties and community investments.   </p>

<p>'The mining and METS sector is a critical pillar of our economy, and it has never been more important than now,' he said.</p>

<p>'Providing apprenticeships, skills and training opportunities for Australians of all ages and all walks of life, particularly in our regional communities, is a commitment we can make to help Australia bounce back.' </p>

<p>The mining giant, who already employ 45,000 Australians, will continue to post available apprenticeship spots on their website's careers portal.</p>

<p>The latest Labour Force report from the Bureau of Statistics showed the unemployment rate in Australia had fallen to 6.8 per cent during the pandemic. </p>
