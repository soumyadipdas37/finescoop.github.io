<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's miserable French Open was complete when Heather Watson joined her compatriots in losing in the opening round.</p>

<p>After just three days of the tournament, no British singles players remain, with Watson joining Andy Murray, Johanna Konta, Dan Evans, Cameron Norrie and Liam Broady by going down 7-6 (4) 6-4 to France's Fiona Ferro.</p>

<p>Watson was an early break up in both sets in damp, cool conditions at Roland Garros but was unable to hold on to her advantage.</p>

<p>Heather Watson shows her dejection following her early exit from the French Open on Tuesday</p>

<p>Fiona Ferro overcame the BritÂ 7-6 (4) 6-4 at Roland Garros despite going behind in both sets</p>

<p>The British number two had a brilliant start to 2020, capped by her fourth WTA title in Acapulco in February, but has not won a match since the tour restarted in August.</p>

<p>That lack of victories perhaps played a part at the biggest moments, with Ferro winning more of the important points in what was a very close match.</p>

<p>Watson had beaten the Frenchwoman twice in 2020 and moved into a 3-1 lead but back came Ferro and it was Watson who had to save three set points at 5-6.</p>

<p>A tie-break was her reward but Watson paid the price for a series of errors and could not build on a 2-0 lead in the second set.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has not won since the resumption of professional tennis last month</p>
