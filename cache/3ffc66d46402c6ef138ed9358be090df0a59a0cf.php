<p>The 48-year-old was forced to call an ambulance when he awoke one night to find a strange fluid around his stomach and legs. He was also struggling to breathe. </p>

<p>Doctors told Diamond his heart was 'only just pumping' but could not explain why it was failing.</p>

<p>The Olympic champion was forced to live in hospital, with his heart functioning at 10 per cent capacity and doctors draining six litres of liquid from his stomach. </p>

<p>Cardiac specialists filled out paperwork requesting a new heart for Diamond and the athlete had an infected gallbladder removed.</p>

<p>'The doctors were scared to hell. I was in hospital for a good three months, they kept an eye on me until my heart function got to more than 20 per cent,' he said. </p>

<p>Diamond then proceeded to make a miraculous recovery that stunned surgeons and saw him completely avoid the need for a heart transplant. </p>

<p>Diamond's heart made a near complete recovery over the next 240 days and his doctors torn up the paperwork requesting a new heart.     </p>

<p>The stunning turnaround came off the back of years of struggle for Diamond (pictured) who was pulled over for a breath test in May 2016 and was convicted of high-range drink driving as well as three firearm offences after a shotgun and ammunition was found in his car</p>

<p>The Olympian now takes five pills a day and said a combination of heart medication, diet and clean living helped him recover.</p>

<p>'It's been an amazing recovery. I won't need a new heart unless my own heart goes downhill, but my specialist is happy with the improvement,' he explained.  </p>

<p>The stunning turnaround came off the back of years of struggle for Diamond.  </p>

<p>Diamond was pulled over for a breath test in May 2016 and was convicted of high-range drink driving as well as three firearm offences after a shotgun and ammunition was found in his car.  </p>

<p>He was later cleared of the firearm convictions but had been dropped from competing at the Rio olympics and left with $120,000 in medical and a legal bills.    </p>

<p>Diamond was on the brink of bankruptcy and was forced to sell his Sydney gold medal in 2017 for $72,000. </p>

<p>He also auctioned off his first gold medal from Atlanta for $62,000 last December. </p>

<p>Diamond started a laundromat business in Newcastle after his recovery and hopes to represent Australia at the Tokyo Olympics next year.</p>
