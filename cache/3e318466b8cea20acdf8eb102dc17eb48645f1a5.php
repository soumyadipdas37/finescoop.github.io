<p>Coleen's very public feud began when she accused Rebekah, wife of footballer Jamie Vardy, of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies. </p>

<p>It has since been claimed that Coleen wants to undertake 'forensic analysis' of Rebekah's electronics to look for evidence, according to a report from The Sun. </p>

<p>A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they’ve told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.</p>

<p>'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.  </p>

<p>Healthy appetite: Coleen certainly has her hands full with fours sons and husband Wayne to feed </p>

<p>Organised: Coleen made the most of doing the food shop while her sons were at school</p>

<p>'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'  </p>

<p>It was also claimed by the publication that Coleen and her legal team will reportedly need a court order to be able to do so. </p>

<p>Coleen reportedly declared that she 'won't be bullied' by Becky when their libel case goes to court.</p>
