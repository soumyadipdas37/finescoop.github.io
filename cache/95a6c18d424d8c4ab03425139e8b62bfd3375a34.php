<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mrs Hinch, aka Sophie Hinchliffe, is best known for being the queen of clean, sharing her top cleaning tips to her 3.7 million Instagram followers. Still, she's pretty knowledgeable about beauty, too.</p>

<p>Taking to her Instagram stories, Sophie took to the camera filter-free and shared a handful of her makeup favourites as she got ready, before heading out to celebrate the launch of her exclusive winter edition range of Bold and Lenor scents. And she looked flawless. </p>

<p>One of the products she used included Maybelline's cult-favourite Instant Age Rewind Concealer.</p>

<p>Sophie took to the camera filter-free and shared a handful of her makeup favourites as she got ready, before heading out to celebrate the launch of her exclusive winter edition range of Bold and Lenor scents</p>

<p>She said: 'Just put on Instant Age Rewind Concealer - I love this Maybelline one. I've been using it for donkey's years.'</p>

<p>Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Concealer has become a hit in the beauty community thanks to it its stellar formulation which conceals dark circles without drawing extra attention to any fine lines.</p>

<p>Plus it's described as being just as creamy and blendable as more expensive counterparts, while also offering long-lasting coverage.</p>

<p>And not only will it erase any signs of sleepless nights, but it also illuminates and lifts the under eyes for a flawless finish.</p>

<p>It includes a hero ingredient called haloxyl that helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines, discolouration, blemishes, and dark circles. You'll see results even after you take it off.</p>

<p>Not only does Mrs Hinch sing its praises, but it's Amazon's bestselling Eye Concealer too, having amassed over 1,200 five-star reviews. Customers describe it as the 'perfect' under-eye concealer and 'blendable and brightening'.</p>

<p>Even better, you won't have to fork out a load of cash to bag Mrs Hinch's go-to concealer as it costs £5.95 - that's 34 per cent off.</p>

<p>To use, you twist the collar of the applicator until the concealer dispenses on the sponge and apply directly to the under-eye area in the shape of an upside-down triangle.</p>

<p>This technique instantly creates the illusion that your face is lifted. Then make sure to blend with your fingers, a Beautyblender, or a makeup brush to finish.</p>

<p>Mrs Hinch then topped off her look with a set of Miracle Makeover Eyelashes by Charlotte Crosby and a quick sweep of MUA Makeup Academy Shimmer Highlight Powder across the cheekbones, the tip of her nose and chin which costs a budget-friendly £3.</p>

<p>Hinchers have already been stocking up on the limited edition range which starts from £2.99 and is available exclusively at Home Bargains across the UK</p>

<p>As a brand ambassador with Lenor and Bold, Mrs Hinch has co-created a limited edition range of scents just in time for Christmas, and it smells divine.</p>

<p>It will come as no surprise that the collaboration is a Home Bargains exclusive - the very place Sophie frequents to pick up her cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>The new Lenor fabric conditioner which usually costs a fiver is currently reduced to £2.99, and Hinchers can also pick up the Bold All in 1 Rose Wonderland Pods for £4.99. </p>
