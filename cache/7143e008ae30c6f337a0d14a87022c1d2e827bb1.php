<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Edouard Mendy has reportedly said his goodbyes to his Rennes team-mates ahead of his imminent move to Chelsea.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has been pursued by the Blues as manager Frank Lampard wants a new goalkeeper to usurp much-maligned Kepa Arrizabalaga as his No 1.</p>

<p>And L'Equipe claim the player has informed the Rennes squad that the deal is set to be completed.</p>

<p>Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy is close to completing a move to Chelsea, says his agent</p>

<p>Talks with Mendy's club Rennes have been ongoing but according to his agent Djily Dieng a significant breakthrough has happened over the past few days.</p>

<p>'The deal with Chelsea is almost done. Only the formalisation is remaining,' he told Extra Time on Thursday afternoon as per Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano. </p>

<p>'It could be completed even in the next hours'.</p>

<p>Mendy is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer of spending for Chelsea after Sportsmail revealed at the weekend they had agreed a £25million fee with the Ligue 1 side.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old is set to join Chelsea in a £25m deal - as Frank Lampard looks for a new No 1</p>

<p>Mendy was initially pulled out of training on Friday after Chelsea's bid was accepted and was subsequently left out of Rennes' 4-2 victory against Nimes on Sunday.</p>

<p>Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and manager Frank Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record.</p>

<p>His arrival would take Chelsea's outlay this summer beyond £250m following the purchases of Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva  and Kai Havertz.</p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga is the Blues current No 1 but he is much-maligned after several mistakes</p>
