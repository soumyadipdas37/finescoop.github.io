<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The UN Security Council will hold emergency talks Tuesday behind closed doors on the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorny Karabakh, where fierce fighting has raged since the weekend, diplomats said Monday.</p>

<p>The meeting will be held at 5.00 pm (2100 GMT), diplomats said. Belgium formally requested the session, after France and Germany had led a push for it to be placed on the agenda.</p>

<p>As early as Sunday, Estonia - a non-permanent council member - emphasized the need for such talks about the outbreak of deadly violence in the separatist region.</p>

<p>Crossroads between the Middle East and Russia: The fighting is in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh of Azerbaijan which is controlled by separatists allied to Armenia. Turkey borders Armenia but is an ally of Azerbaijan, and Ankara's support for Baku is the latest military adventure in the region after incursions into Syria and Libya. Both Armenia and Azerbaijan are former Soviet republics that border Iran. Moscow has called for both sides to stop the fighting</p>

<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan released dramatic combat footage yesterday of Cold War tanks being blown to pieces by drone strikes as the two countries fight over a contested region.</p>

<p>A new proxy war is brewing in the Middle East as Turkey flexes its muscles by backing Azerbaijan in its war with Armenian separatists, amid heavy fighting which has left at least 39 people dead in the last two days.</p>

<p>Britain also joined the European push for the talks, said diplomats, who added that a joint declaration could be issued at its conclusion - either by the entire council or its European members if a full consensus cannot be reached.</p>

<p>The clashes come in the middle of the annual UN General Assembly and raises fears of a war between ex-Soviet republics Azerbaijan and Armenia in the Caucasus.</p>

<p>Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a territorial dispute over the ethnic Armenian region of Nagorny Karabakh for decades, with deadly fighting flaring up earlier this year and in 2016.</p>

<p>Increasingly deadly fighting raged Monday between Azerbaijani and Armenian forces, sparking bellicose rhetoric from Turkey despite international pleas for a halt in fighting between the longtime enemies.</p>

<p>At least 95 people have been killed in the most recent fighting, including 11 civilians, according to the latest available tallies.</p>

<p>Tensions in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region have caused one war, threatened to bring about others and killed thousands of people over more than 30 years.</p>

<p>Until 1991, the territory was in the Soviet Union and most decisions were made in Moscow. </p>

<p>But as the USSR fell apart, it became clear that Nagorno-Karabakh would come under Azerbaijani rule - which was unacceptable to the Armenian majority. </p>

<p>Sectarian conflict erupted, escalating into war in 1991 between Azerbaijan's troops and Armenian forces. Thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were displaced. </p>

<p>Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence that year but it was not widely recognised, leaving the ethnic Armenian administration in a state of legal limbo and under blockade from Azerbaijan's government. </p>

<p>By 1994, when a ceasefire was agreed, ethnic Armenians controlled almost all of Nagorno-Karabakh, plus some surrounding Azeri districts that gave them a buffer zone and land bridge connecting their region to Armenia. </p>

<p>Azerbaijan vowed to take back control over the territory, using military force if necessary. The country is backed by its ethnic ally Turkey. </p>

<p>Deadly fighting broke out in 2016 and again earlier this year, raising fears of a new war and a proxy conflict drawing in Russia and other powers. </p>

<p>International efforts over the years to find a lasting peace settlement, involving France, the United States and Russia as mediators, have failed to clinch a deal. </p>
