<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta admits his own experience does not provide the finest example but expects Willian to make a long-term contribution at Arsenal.</p>

<p>The three-year deal signed by the 32-year-old Brazilian is a culture shift at a club where the policy for many years under Arsene Wenger was to offer players over 30 deals of no more than 12 months.</p>

<p>‘Don’t compare him to me, I am a bad example,’ said Arteta, who retired at the age of 34 and barely played in the Premier League during the final 18 months of his career.</p>

<p>Willian trains with his Arsenal team-mates on Friday ahead of their clash with Everton</p>

<p>Gunners boss Arteta has backed his summer arrival to make a lasting impact at the Emirates</p>

<p>‘He is much better than me and he is much fitter than me. He has experience in this league and he is always available. He is a player who does not miss football matches.</p>

<p>‘In all the conversations I had with him, the things that stood out were his ambition and his willingness to be the man who can drive this club forward and be a big part of it.’</p>

<p>Willian started 38 games for Chelsea last season and came on nine times as a substitute.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old signed a three-year-deal worth £220,000-per-week after his Chelsea exit</p>

<p>Arteta believes the Brazilian's experience will prove invaluable to the Gunners' dressing room</p>

<p>Arsenal were criticised for snapping him up on a free and giving him a three-year contract worth £220,000 a week soon after announcing 55 redundancies.</p>

<p>‘We need a balance in this squad,’ said Arteta. ‘We have some really young talent and they need experienced players who they can just put their shirts on and start performing.’</p>

<p>Arteta’s main injury problems are in central defence for Saturday's fixture at Fulham, with David Luiz, Shkodran Mustafi, Pablo Mari, Calum Chambers and Sokratis ruled out.</p>

<p>Fulham v Arsenal, kicks off at 12.30pm LIVE on BT Sport 1.</p>
