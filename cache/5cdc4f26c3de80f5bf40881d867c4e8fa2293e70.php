<p>Shortly afterward, Hilaria posted a lengthy message addressing the digs on her Instagram page.</p>

<p>'Let me be really clear about something: I will post here and there about how we are doing. If you send me a comment telling me how much to post or how little, and I happen to see the message, I will just block you. I’m not interested in those opinions. 5 kids in, we are happy, healthy, bonded, tired, busy, but blessed,' she wrote. </p>

<p>She reminded her followers that it only takes a short time to post and that she also has friends on the app, not just fans. </p>

<p>Hilaria captioned the post: 'In case you missed my stories and you need clarity here too. As I said there: 45 seconds on this and that is all I’m giving it. Post from here will hopefully just be babies and silliness and love.' </p>
