<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has revealed his pride at signing for the club he has supported ever since buying a Blues shirt in a shop as a youngster.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old Senegal international joined the Premier League side on a five-year deal from French club Rennes this week.</p>

<p>And he revealed he has always 'adored' the west London giants after a trip to Brighton in which he donned a Blues top in a store for the first time as an excited 12-year-old.</p>

<p>New goalkeeper Edouard Mendy has revealed he's been a Chelsea fan ever since he was 12 </p>

<p>Mendy is now a Chelsea player having completed his £22million transfer from Rennes</p>

<p>‘Yes! I’ve been a Chelsea supporter since I was little. I adore this club,' Mendy told the club website. </p>

<p>'When I was 12 I had the chance with a past club I played for to go to Brighton, and we watched a match. I thought English football was amazing.</p>

<p>'We went into a shop and I saw the Chelsea shirt, this was about 2003 when Ranieri was the manager, and I bought this shirt. So I’ve always liked this club.’ </p>

<p>Boss Frank Lampard expects his new signing to increase competition for the No 1 spot with under-pressure stopper Kepa Arrizabalaga and Willy Caballero also battling for the position.</p>

<p>And Mendy admitted it will be a 'privilege' to wear Chelsea's colours for real as a member of Lampard's star-laden squad.  </p>

<p>'I’m very proud,’ Mendy added. </p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga has been under huge pressure and the signing of Mendy adds to that </p>

<p>‘When a club like Chelsea is interested in you, it means you’ve done great work every weekend. </p>

<p>'Everyone knows Chelsea are one of the biggest clubs in the world, and everyone would like to play for this team, but not everyone can. </p>

<p>'To have a chance to wear this shirt and defend the club’s colours, it’s a privilege.’  </p>

<p>Chelsea were keen to bring in a keeper with greater presence to complement their existing options which helped the 6ft 5in Mendy stopper get nod over other options the Blues considered along with his reasonable price tag. </p>

<p>And he will now be available for inclusion in Lampard’s squad to face West Brom on Saturday after completing his switch. </p>

<p>Mendy's arrival gives  Chelsea manager Frank Lampard new options for the No 1 shirt</p>
