<p>And as news broke that the E! reality series is coming to an end after 20 seasons, Caitlyn Jenner was seen on her daily Starbucks run in LA.</p>

<p>As of Tuesday night, the 70-year-old has not publicly commented on the demise of KUWTK which still stars her daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner.</p>

<p>Pensive: Caitlyn Jenner, 70, looked to be deep in thought Tuesday as she picked up a drink in Malibu after news broke that Keeping Up With The Kardashians is ending after 20 seasons</p>

<p>The reality show was the brainchild of Caitlyn's ex Kris and TV host and producer Ryan Seacrest and followed the lives of Kris' family that included Caitlyn, then Bruce, along with Kendall and Kylie, and Kris' four children from her marriage to Robert Kardashian, Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob.</p>

<p>At the beginning, it was Bruce who was the celebrity given his fame as a gold medalist in the decathlon at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>But in the intervening 13 years, he has been eclipsed by the phenomenal popularity of the Kardashian-Jenner siblings who turned their family's fame into a multi-million dollar empire. </p>

<p>Caitlyn starred for two seasons on the spin-off I Am Cait in 2016 and has just launched her own YouTube channel.</p>

<p>End of era: She was a regular part of KUWTK from its debut in 2007 until her divorce from Kris Jenner in 2015 and her gender transition. Her daughters Kendall and Kylie still star on the show</p>

<p>For Tuesday's outing, Caitlyn wore a gray polo shirt with patterned short skirt. She sported sunglasses and a face mask, which didn't cover her nose, and she left her long hair loose</p>

<p>Looking back: In the video, Bruce, as she was then, is seen  being encouraged to get a hair cut at a styling session because then wife Kris Jenner doesn't like him having a ponytail</p>

<p>Step-children: Kourtney Kardashian, left, and Khloe Kardashian, right, try to encourage Bruce to make a change. But Khloe admits on camera that it's 'his head' so he can do what he wants</p>

<p>Just a trim: When Kris arrives to see what's going on, she is less than impressed that her husband isn't getting a short back and sides</p>

<p>Glam session: After his trim ,Bruce then got some highlights in his hair</p>

<p>She shared a segment in which she, or Bruce as she was then, faced off over a haircut. </p>

<p>Bruce was seen with Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian at a hair styling session where the girls are encouraging him to get his hair cut while Bruce is reluctant because, he explains, he likes having a ponytail. </p>

<p>In the end he gets a little trim but when Kris arrives to see how it's going, she is not amused.</p>

<p>In another segment, Caitlyn recalls the time that Kris put Viagra in his morning coffee, only for Kris' son Rob Kardashian to pick up the mug in the kitchen by mistake.</p>

<p>There then ensued great hilarity at the unfortunate Rob who suffered a lasting erection and had to seek medical help. </p>
