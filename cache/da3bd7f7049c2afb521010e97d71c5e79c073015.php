<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kylie Jenner was not impressed after her big sister Kim Kardashian shared an unrecognizable throwback showing her as a geeky youngster with bad bangs. </p>

<p>'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. </p>

<p>In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos. </p>

<p>Fledgling superstars: Kim Kardashian shared an epic throwback photo of herself with her sisters Khloe, Kylie, and Kendall Jenner on Friday </p>

<p>'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked. </p>

<p>'Absolutely,' Kylie replied back.  </p>

<p>Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. </p>

<p>Indeed, the women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair color.  </p>

<p>The photo appeared to have been taken at a restaurant, where Kim and Khloe sat at the table while their younger sisters posed beside them.</p>

<p>Minor tweaks: The photo Kim shared was significantly lightened, and appeared to have adjusted the size of Kendall and Khloe's noses</p>

<p>Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image </p>

<p>'Babies,' Kim captioned the snap.  </p>

<p>Pre-teen Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face.</p>

<p>Kim still looked glam as she sat at the center of the table, with her honey-hued locks perfectly sleeked to the side.  </p>

<p>Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling. </p>

<p>It's Kim! Kim has returned to her natural black hair after sporting blonde locks in 2009</p>

<p>Throwback: Khloe Kardashian has remained a fan of the long, loose waves over the years</p>

<p>Khloe, meanwhile, was styled up with a berry pink lip and head full of loose waves. </p>

<p>She sat before a sleek silver camera - a rarity nowadays in the era of iPhones.</p>

<p>Kim appeared to have taken some creative liberties with the photo as well, as the newly uploaded snap was significantly lighter than the original. The shape of Kendall and Khloe's noses even appeared to have been adjusted.  </p>

<p>At the time the photos were taken, the women were all just beginning to take the world of reality TV by storm with their E! series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which debuted in 2007. </p>

<p>Little did the world know then just how their careers would take off. </p>

<p>Model in the making: A young Kendall wore braces in the throwback Kim posted </p>

<p>Pre-teen years: Kylie rocked a side-swept bang and allowed her freckles to shine through with hardly a touch of makeup on her face</p>

<p>All four of the women - including sister Kourtney Kardashian, who was not pictured - went on to enjoy major success in the spotlight, and have become highly influential in the entertainment industry. </p>

<p>In addition to their time on E!, the stars also pursued careers outside of reality television.</p>

<p>Kylie built a makeup empire out of her eponymous cosmetics line, Kendall is now a major model, Khloe launched a jean range, while Kim founded a cosmetics and shapewear line.</p>

<p>Kourtney has also launched her wellness brand, Poosh, where she shares her beauty and health tips. </p>

<p>Sadly now for KUWTK fans, the show recently announced it would be ending in 2021.  </p>
