<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amazon is rolling out self-driving delivery robots. </p>

<p>The internet giant announced Wednesday that six 'Scout' robots will deliver packages to customers in a neighborhood in Snohomish County, Washington.</p>

<p>Each Scout robot is a squat, bright blue device that gets around on six wheels.  </p>

<p>The battery-powered devices about the size of a small cooler and can deliver packages autonomously. </p>

<p>And city or suburban dwellers don't have to worry about Scout running them over on the street, as Amazon says the robots 'roll along sidewalks at a walking pace.'</p>

<p>It appears that there's a door on the top of each device that users can lift open to remove their package. </p>

<p>It's unclear how the robots verify the user's identity, but other autonomous delivery robots, such as Postmates' food delivery robot,  requires users to enter a code on the device's touchscreen first before they can retrieve their order.  </p>

<p>For now, Scout devices will deliver packages Monday through Friday during the daytime, Sean Scott, vice president of Amazon Scout, wrote in a blog spot. </p>

<p>'The devices will autonomously follow their delivery route but will initially be accompanied by an Amazon employee,' Scott explained. </p>

<p>'We developed Amazon Scout at our research and development lab in Seattle, ensuring the devices can safely and efficiently navigate around pets, pedestrians and anything else in their path.' </p>

<p>Scott added that the company will use what it learns from the first Scout trial to 'provide even more sustainability and convenience to customer deliveries.'</p>

<p>Aside from Scout, Amazon is also said to be developing delivery drones, which could also revolutionize the last-mile portion of the delivery process. </p>

<p>It's also using robots in its warehouses to handle menial tasks.  </p>

<p>Last-mile delivery includes the process of getting a package from the warehouse or a delivery truck to your door. </p>

<p>Amazon is increasingly relying on robots for some menial tasks in its warehouses, from transporting goods across short distances to stocking shelves. </p>

<p>Now, the internet giant has devised a system to protect employees from getting run over by any roving robots. </p>

<p>Employees are being fitted with 'robotic tech vests' that notify the machines of their whereabouts so that any potential accidents are avoided.</p>

<p>Employees are being fitted with 'robotic tech vests' that notify robots of their whereabouts. They're designed by Amazon Robotics and worn like a pair of suspenders attached to a belt</p>

<p>Over the course of the past year, workers in more than 25 fulfillment centers have been able to use the vests. </p>

<p>The vests were designed by Amazon Robotics and are worn like a pair of suspenders that are attached to a belt. </p>

<p>The device is packed with sensors that communicate with nearby robots, alerting them to an employee's location so that they don't crash into them.  </p>

<p>Amazon isn't the only tech giant developing delivery drones, however. </p>

<p>Postmates unveiled its 'Serve' robot last December, which is meant for food deliveries, can carry a payload of up to 50lbs and can travel up to 30 miles on a single charge. </p>

<p>Starship Technologies' slow-moving delivery bots have already been trialed across the world, including in Hamburg, Washington and California, delivering everything from groceries to takeout pizza.</p>

<p>They have travelled more than 100,000 miles in testing mode in more than 100 cities in 20 different countries. </p>

<p>This week, the company announced that the robots would begin delivering food to students and staff at George Mason University.  </p>
