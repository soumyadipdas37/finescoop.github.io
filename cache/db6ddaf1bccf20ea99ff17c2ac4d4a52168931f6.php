<p>Every light bulb was stolen to smoke meth, doors were ripped off their hinges and swapped around, and a cannabis plant was growing in the backyard.</p>

<p>Broken furniture, mouldy mattresses, and mountains of garbage filled three skip bins on the front lawn, while inside disgusting dishes littered the kitchen. </p>

<p>Owner Mary-Rose Mitchell said the damage and cleanup of the house in Eaton, just outside Bunbury in Western Australia, would cost more than $20,000.</p>

<p>Tenants from hell left a house covered in rubbish, animal droppings, and graffiti with mice living in the beds and maggots feasting on rotten food</p>

<p>Broken furniture, mouldy mattresses, and mountains of garbage filled three skip bins on the front lawn</p>

<p>The trashed bathroom is covered in vermin droppings with the doors ripped off the cabinets and rubbish everywhere</p>

<p>What the bathroom looked like before it was trashed by the tenants who led a plague of mice in to defile it</p>

<p>Then there was more than $4,500 in unpaid rent that the tenants failed to pay before bolting in the dead of night on September 17.</p>

<p>Surrounding residents called the couple 'neighbours from hell' who threatened them with knives and put them in fear of their lives and made them afraid to let their children play outside.</p>

<p>Ms Mitchell penned a tongue-in-cheek open letter to the tenants since they had blocked online her when she tried to enforce a court order for the unpaid rent.</p>

<p>She said they started out as respectful tenants five months ago, but things turned pear-shaped when she got sick of late rent payments and refused to renew the lease.</p>

<p>'I understand it's pretty hard to pay bills when you are on Covid JobSeeker or whatever you got for sitting at home all day watching your really flash TVs,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Rotting food and filthy dishes cover the kitchen, attracting vermin that now plague the house</p>

<p>How the kitchen looked before the tenants moved in and left their disgusting rubbish everywhere</p>

<p>Rubbish dumped in the corner of the bedroom, where the landlord said mice and made their home and some were found dead under the bed</p>

<p>Ms Mitchell said she was curious as to why the couple or their 'three or five' children were always too sick for rent inspections, but now understood.</p>

<p>'I reckon it was all the mice living in your beds, or the dead mice under them, their poo in every cupboard, drawers, or holes you've made in the walls,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'The old rotten food under the beds, maggots, the wet mattresses and the general health of the house.'</p>

<p>'Hopefully at your next home you keep this in mind as it's no wonder you can't get a job being that sick all the time.'</p>

<p>Ms Mitchell also claimed the house's pool had turned black and scummy because couple stole the pool pump's motor and put it in their electric bike.</p>

<p>Rubbish including one of many old mattresses dumped in the backyard</p>

<p>How this part of the backyard looked before the tenants replaced the family-friendly setting with rubbish</p>

<p>The owner claimed the house's pool had turned black and scummy because couple stole the pool pump's motor and put it in their electric bike</p>

<p>The pool looks markedly different in this photo of the house before the tenants moved in five months earlier</p>

<p>Police visited the house to view the damage, and found cannabis plants growing in the backyard, along with small bags containing traces of meth. </p>

<p>'I'm not personally to familiar with these things, however with all those uppers, would have assumed the house was spotless,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'The police also explained that was the reason there were no light bulbs in the house and all the light fittings were broken.'</p>

<p>Ms Mitchell also let her former tenants know they left a lot of mail behind - including a $1,236 water bill and a $938 power bill. </p>

<p>'Please send me your forwarding address so we can forward them on... and I will let the driver of the skip bin know where to drop your belongings,' she wrote.</p>

<p>What the lounge room looked like before the house was trashed and the carpet covered in rubbish and grime</p>

<p>There was also more than $4,500 in unpaid rent that the tenants failed to pay before bolting in the dead of night on September 17</p>

<p>The irritated landlord tallied up how much it cost to even start the repairs, including $420 for each skip bin, and $1,328 for wall, paint, and door repairs.</p>

<p>Then there was $1,850 for pool cleaning and new pump, $321 for window repairs, $480 for garden tidy and $900 to paint over the kids graffitied walls the children left.</p>

<p>'You clearly have heaps of skills - growing interesting plants, turning anything with a motor into a mode of transport, finding and installing random doors, utilising light bulbs for purposes which don't create light... surely these skills would make one highly employable?' she wrote, mockingly.</p>

<p>A fundraiser has so far attracted $400 in donations to help Ms Mitchell clean and repair her investment property.</p>

<p>WA Police said victim reported the matter to police and it was under investigation. </p>
