<p>The former Australia captain, who has led CA's community cricket program since 2018, will leave her role in November.</p>

<p>So highly rated is Clark that her name was thrown up as a contender for the chief executive role that is being filled by Nick Hockley on an interim basis.</p>

<p>The 50-year-old Clark will remain involved as a director of the Twenty20 World Cup committee in the lead-up to the postponed men's edition in Australia in 2022.</p>

<p>'I have loved my time working for the sport and while this chapter is coming to a close after 20 years with CA...I am committed to finding new ways to give back to the game that has given me so much,' Clark said.</p>

<p>'My dream is to help young girls develop the confidence, skills and courage to step forward when leadership opportunities arise.</p>

<p>Hockley said Clark's impact on the sport, and at CA, had been profound.</p>

<p>'Belinda's impact across Australian Cricket has positioned her as one of Australia's most influential leaders of our time,' he said.</p>

<p>'Belinda has forged a path for women in cricket long before the days of the Australian women's team and WBBL players became household names.</p>

<p>'Everyone across Australian cricket will miss working with Belinda, but we wish her all the best.' </p>
