<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jyh Kao has bought five properties since 2013</p>

<p>An Australian marketing manager has revealed how he built a $2.5million property portfolio in seven years by renovating homes and improving their rental yield.</p>

<p>Jyh Kao was just 24 years old in 2013 when he closed a deal on a small $428,000 one-bedroom apartment in North Sydney.</p>

<p>'I didn't have a clear reason for investing at the time and didn't know much about what I was doing. I just knew I'd be better off financially in the long term,' he said.</p>

<p>Now 31, Jyh has five properties dotted across New South Wales and Queensland he tends to, two of which he renovated to increase the overall value of. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Buy, rent and renovate. Spend money on cosmetic renovations, which will yield in rental income.</p></li>
<li><p>Never overspend on a renovation. A good rule of thumb is that you spend between 10 and 15 per cent of the property value on a cosmetic renovation. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>* Of that money, around two per cent should go on the facade alone. </p>

<ul>
<li>Leverage any capital growth to allow you to buy further properties. </li>
</ul>

<p>2013: Property one</p>

<p>Jyh was two years into a graduate marketing role at a telecommunications company and had been working in retail since he was 15 when he bought his first property.</p>

<p>His savings from both of these jobs became his deposit, with a small amount of money left over for a cosmetic renovation.</p>

<p>With just 52 metres square of floor space, the apartment was compact however it was promising as a rental because of its location so close to Sydney's CBD. </p>

<p>Though the apartment was definitely liveable, Jyh felt it was cosmetically tired. He invested another $10,000 to renovate the space, paving the way for him to increase the apartment's rent from $465 to $515 per week.</p>

<p>From the outset, Jyh's strategy was to buy, renovate and rent them out. </p>

<p>He waited for capital growth to accumulate on this property, while the rental income received covered the bulk of his mortgage repayments. </p>

<p>It was this very premise that enabled him to leverage that capital growth to buy his second property three years later at 27. </p>

<p>2015: His parents sell the family home  </p>

<p>Jyh's parents sold their Lindfield family home in New South Wales in 2015. The Kao family bought the home for $440,000 in 2000. </p>

<p>In 2015 it sold for $1.6 million, over three times its original purchase price. In the years his parents had owned the family home, they'd completed several renovations that added value to the property. </p>

<p>This included revamping the home's kitchen, two bathrooms and adding a rear patio. They also converted their garage into a granny flat, further increasing the property's value.</p>

<p>After witnessing their parents triple their investment through a long-term property hold, Jyh was inspired to get started on building his own investment portfolio. </p>

<p>2016: Property two </p>

<p>Seeing what his parents achieved Jyh decided it was time to purchase his next property in 2016. </p>

<p>At this point, he'd been promoted to a digital marketing executive position, which came with a higher salary, so was ready to commit to the expansion of his property portfolio. </p>

<p>He leveraged the equity from his North Sydney apartment to purchase a four-bedroom house in Wynnum, Queensland, for $515,000. </p>

<p>The house was in relatively good condition so he opted to rent it out immediately for $470 per week. </p>

<p>He hopes to renovate the interior and exterior of this house at a later date, once his existing tenants vacate. As it stands today, this property is currently valued at $630,000. </p>

<p>Organic capital growth he acquired by holding onto the property for the long term, can be used as leverage to keep building his portfolio.</p>

<p>2018: Did a course with Renovating for Profit  </p>

<p>In 2018 Jyh decided to take his property investment efforts more seriously. </p>

<p>Opting to invest in education to minimise mistakes and grow his portfolio even further, Jyh became a cosmetic Renovations For Profit student. </p>

<p>Having seen founder Cherie Barber at a property seminar in 2014, Jyh had been following her work, watching her videos and attending her seminars. </p>

<p>'Cherie's strategy of renovating to add value really resonated with me and I had a growing passion for renovating and decorating homes from when I helped my parents renovate their own home,' he said. </p>

<p>2018: Property three </p>

<p>Soon after completing the course in 2018, Jyh purchased a two-bedroom apartment in the beachside Sydney suburb of Brighton-Le-Sands. </p>

<p>At this point he'd been promoted to a marketing manager role at the telecommunications company he worked for and had made up his mind to purchase and renovate properties as a side gig.</p>

<p>This house was purchased for $615,000 using a mixture of equity in his existing property portfolio and his personal savings. </p>

<p>Soon after completing the course in 2018, Jyh purchased a two-bedroom apartment in the beachside Sydney suburb of Brighton-Le-Sands</p>

<p>Jyh spent $6,000 in savings on a two-week renovation blitz powered by the knowledge he'd gained during the course. </p>

<p>'I was able to instantly uplift the value of the apartment and the rental income significantly through a smart renovation without overspending,' he said.</p>

<p>'Without proper knowledge, it's very easy to blow out costs.'</p>

<p>Thanks to this reno, he was able to increase the apartment's rent from $450 to $490 per week. The apartment is now worth $630,000. </p>

<p>2020: Properties four and five</p>

<p>This year has been a big year for Jyh, who saw an opportunity arise in the Brisbane property market due to flat growth. </p>

<p>Motivated to take advantage of the low house prices, he purchased two four-bedroom houses in Crestmead, Queensland, using a combination of equity and personal savings. </p>

<p>One house was purchased for $330,000, while the other cost Jyh $315,000. </p>

<p>Both were bought under market value and are now rented out. </p>

<p>As both properties are cash-flow positive, Jyh is planning to renovate them and hold the properties long-term.</p>
