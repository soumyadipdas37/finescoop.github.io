<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who was a teenager at an elite Sydney private school when a teacher seduced her has stared him down in court.</p>

<p>The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a 17-year-old schoolgirl when Ben Fenner began sending her sexualised messages via WhatsApp.</p>

<p>'All the messages on here are encrypted ... great for secrets,' he messaged her, according to the agreed facts.</p>

<p>The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was a 17-year-old schoolgirl when Ben Fenner (left) began sending her sexualised messages via Whatsapp</p>

<p>Fenner has pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 18 and under his care.</p>

<p>He asked Judge Robert Weber to take into account a further eight matters of sexual intercourse with his former student.</p>

<p>On Thursday in the District Court the woman read out her victim impact statement saying it's taken a long time to realise she was manipulated and groomed by her teacher.</p>

<p>'I thought this was a normal thing ... a normal relationship,' she said.</p>

<p>'He knew the rules and the code of conduct ... he used me ... I was a vulnerable 17-year-old, you were 33.'</p>

<p>At the time of the abuse she was suffering from depression and anxiety and had panic attacks after the loss of a family member.</p>

<p>'I feel you have taken so much away from me ... my friends and high school experience,' she said.</p>

<p>'All the messages on here are encrypted ... great for secrets,' Fenner messaged her, according to the agreed facts</p>

<p>She said she was proud she reported the 'perverted mess' to the police so that Fenner could not use his position of power to abuse anyone again.</p>

<p>After finishing her statement she stared straight at Fenner who had his head bowed.</p>

<p>Giving evidence, Fenner apologised for causing her grief and pain, and ruining the time leading up to her Higher School Certificate.</p>

<p>When asked if he knew what he was doing was wrong, a serious beach of trust and an abuse of the teacher-student relationship, he continually answered 'yes'.</p>

<p>'You noticed there was some marks on her neck you thought were hickeys ... After that you asked what she liked sexually,' crown prosecutor Roger Kimbell said.</p>

<p>'That was completely inappropriate wasn't it?'</p>

<p>Fenner was born in England but moved to Sydney to start a new life after the breakdown of his marriage in 2011.</p>

<p>Fenner has pleaded guilty to seven counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 18 and under his care</p>

<p>He described the philosophy at the eastern suburbs school where he taught biology as significantly different to other schools he had worked at.</p>

<p>Teachers were encouraged to give students their personal phone numbers and to be available for contact out of regular school hours.</p>

<p>His text messages to his victim turned sexual before organising to meet up outside school grounds over a three-month period.</p>

<p>In one instance she thought they were going to the beach for a school assignment, but instead he had sexual intercourse with her.</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Phillip Gibson said Fenner felt unable to extricate himself from the situation, fearing the depression and anxiety he experienced in past relationship breakdowns.</p>

<p>While Fenner was not suffering a severe mental illness at the time, leading up to the period of offending he had regressed to an 'low point emotionally'.</p>

<p>The Crown said there has been a gross power imbalance between a child and adult.</p>

<p>'It's not a case of a relationship between two consenting adults,' Mr Kimbell said.</p>

<p>'He's an intelligent professional man in his 30s almost twice her age.'</p>

<p>Judge Weber will hand down his sentence on October 9.</p>
