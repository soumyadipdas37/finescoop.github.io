<p>The Tottenham forward suffered a hamstring injury in last weekend's draw at Newcastle</p>

<p>Son has been one of Tottenham's best players this season, scoring five times in five matches.</p>

<p>Mourinho has been desperate to sign another striker to ease the burden on Harry Kane and the Tottenham boss is confident one will arrive before next Monday's deadline.</p>

<p>He added:Â 'I am optimistic, but more than that, the feeling that I like is that we are trying everything to do it.'</p>
