<p>Get ready: PETA, the animal rights organization, debuted a 'Joe Exotic Tiger Killer Costume' for a whopping $159.99 earlier this year</p>

<p>While these certainly seem to be the first 'sexy' Tiger King costumes, they're not actually the first Halloween getups inspired by the show.</p>

<p>In May, nearly six months ahead of the holiday, the animal rights organization PETA debuted a 'Joe Exotic Tiger Killer Costume' for a whopping $159.99.</p>

<p>The costume, which is available for pre-order and will ship by September 30, includes an orange prison jumpsuit, a blonde wig, and a fuzzy stuffed tiger.</p>

<p>PETA is clearly no fan of Joe's, and rushed to get the costume ready ahead of dedicated Halloween retailers.</p>

<p>In the item's description, the organization takes issue with the light, amused way that some viewers have watched the documentary, stressing that Joe — real name Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage — has been found guilty of crimes.</p>

<p>'Netflix's docuseries Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness glossed over Joe Exotic's cruelty to animals, but PETA's spoof Halloween costume makes clear that "Mr. Mullet" belongs behind bars, where he can no longer harm a tuft of fur on any animal's head,' reads the site.</p>

<p>'We hope everyone will be out and about by Halloween, so this one-of-a-kind costume is available for preorder now,' it goes on.  </p>

<p>Not a fan: PETA says: '"Mr. Mullet" belongs behind bars, where he can no longer harm a tuft of fur on any animal's head' </p>

<p>'It comes with everything you need to portray the notorious tiger abuser: a blond wig, a mustache, jail bars, a plush pouncing tiger, and an orange jumpsuit with the more apt moniker "Tiger Killer" on the front.'</p>

<p>PETA suggests washing the polyester-cotton blend costume with cruelty-free detergent.</p>

<p>A spokesperson further slammed Joe in s statement to Orlando Weekly.</p>

<p>'Tiger King has exposed tiger exhibitors as ghouls who steal cubs from their mothers, exploit them as living photo props, and then often discard or kill them when they grow up,' PETA Foundation director of captive animal law enforcement Brittany Peet said.</p>

<p>'This Halloween, PETA will poke some pointed fun at a tiger killer who belongs behind bars, where he can no longer harm a hair on any animal's head.'</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Joe was was sentenced to 22 years in prison for a murder-for-hire plot against Carole Baskin, killing five tigers, selling tiger cubs, and falsifying wildlife records. </p>

<p>Dress-up time! Social media users did the 'Tiger King Challenge' when the docu-series debuted</p>

<p>He once was the owner of Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Wynnewood, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>The jury heard evidence that he paid a man $3,000 to travel to Florida to kill Baskin, with a promise to pay more after she was dead. He was upset that Baskin, an outspoken critic of his, had won a million-dollar civil judgment against him.</p>

<p>After his initial attempt failed, he offered $10,000 to an undercover FBI agent to kill Baskin during a meeting that was recorded and played for the jury. In the recording, he told the agent: 'Just like follow her into a mall parking lot and just cap her and drive off.' </p>

<p>In January of this year, he was sentenced to 22 years in prison. </p>
