<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jon Gosselin's son Collin sounded upbeat as he updated his Instagram followers about his living situation with his father over the weekend.</p>

<p>The 16-year-old former reality TV star posted a closeup selfie showing off his new haircut on Sunday, along with a short message.</p>

<p>'Got a new cut and I’m doing better than ever,' he wrote. 'Life is too great to not enjoy! #livelikeitsyourlastday.'</p>

<p>Feeling good: Collin Gosselin, 16, updated his followers on Sunday with a selfie of his new haircut and said he was 'better than ever' after his father Jon Gosselin took him out of a boarding school he found abusive</p>

<p>Collin has been living with his father ever since he was pulled out of the Fairmont Behavioral Health Institute.</p>

<p>In an interview with DailyMailTV from September 2019, Jon claimed that his ex-wife Kate mentally tortured Collin and his sister Hannah.</p>

<p>Collin managed to smuggle out a letter written in smudged crayon that asked for his father's help in rescuing him from the school via his older roommate.</p>

<p>'I told Mom I want to live with you, she said no. But right? She can’t choose for me. I’m old enough now, I’m YOUR son, not hers,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'She was abusive to me after I left your house. I’m sorry. Take this to court because … you’re my dad, my savior. I’m counting on you to get me out of here. Daddy, I love you. Save me. Please come FAST. I love you. Help me. BYE.'</p>

<p>Free and clear: Collin has been living with his father ever since he was pulled out of the Fairmont Behavioral Health Institute, where his mother placed him</p>

<p>Two for the road: Collin and his sister Hannah now live with Jon in Pennsylvania, while the other four sextuplets and their older twin siblings live with Kate</p>

<p>Jon took the matter to court, and he was award sole legal and physical custody of his son after his ex and her attorney didn't show up.</p>

<p>Kate previously had been awarded full legal custody over their sextuplets, and she and Jon initially shared physical custody.</p>

<p>Back in February, Jon revealed on the First Class Fatherhood podcast that Kate had had 'no contact' with Collin since he moved in with his dad.</p>

<p>'Right now, it’s very tumultuous pretty much because there’s no contact between Collin and his other siblings,' the former reality star said. 'There’s contact between Hannah and the other siblings, [but not with Collin].'</p>

<p>Hannah and Collin now both live with Jon, though their siblings Aaden, Alexis, Joel and Leah all live with Kate, as do the older twins Cara and Maddy, 19. </p>

<p>Cut off: Back in February, Jon revealed on the First Class Fatherhood podcast that Kate had had 'no contact' with Collin since he moved in with his dad; shown in June 2019</p>

<p>Ouch: Collin shared a moving tribute to his father's girlfriend Collen Conrad for Mother's Day that seemed to shade his mother Kate Gosselin by leaving her out completely</p>

<p>Collin's negative feelings toward his mother were put on display (by omission) in a Mother's Day post in which he praised his father's girlfriend Colleen for being an 'awesome mother figure' and one of his 'best friends,' while not even mentioning his own mother.</p>

<p>Jon previously lambasted Kate for sending Collin away to a special needs institution when he didn't suffer from anything more serious than common ADHD.</p>

<p>The reality star claimed Kate was 'narcissistic and selfish' in his interview with DailyMailTV last year. </p>

<p>'She always speaks for the children. They say this, they want to do this — unicorns, rainbows and look, flying pigs. It's all lies. They all have voices.'</p>

<p>Jon claimed that while Collin was 'caged' for three years at the institution, his mother only visited him three times for less than two hours total, all while refusing to tell Jon where Collin was being kept. </p>
