<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Aussie TikTok star has created an astounding video proving how little Sunrise host David 'Kochie' Koch, 64, has aged over the past decade.</p>

<p>The hilarious clip, uploaded on Wednesday by Swaré, uses two almost identical photos of Kochie that were taken 10 years apart.   </p>

<p>Kochie has remained remarkably youthful over the years, with minimal visible wrinkles on his visage well into his 60s.</p>

<p>What's his secret? TikTok star hilariously documents how little Sunrise host David 'Kochie' Koch, 64, has changed over the past 10 years. Pictured: left 2010, right 2020</p>

<p>The veteran Sunrise host has fronted the program for 18 years, after initially being hired to only temporarily replace Chris Reason in 2002.</p>

<p>'David Koch is a vampire,' the satirical video began, as the TV theme song to Netflix's sci-fi show Stranger Things played for added effect.</p>

<p>'Here is a photo of David Koch earlier this year, seems pretty reasonable, here is a photo of David Koch 10 years ago, hmmm, looks exactly same. He's 64 by the way, or so he says,' the TikTok creator sarcastically added.</p>

<p>'David Koch is a vampire': The clearly satirical video hinted the secret behind Kochie's youthful appearance was supernatural</p>

<p>'Still don't believe me? Well, look up Koch Media. What do they make? Movies about vampires!' the TikTok star joked.</p>

<p>Koch Media, which is a global developer, publisher and distributor of computer and video games, actually has no tie to Kochie.</p>

<p>However, Kochie does own his own business - boutique media production agency, Pinstripe Media.</p>

<p>In February 2018, Kochie was left baffled when a lie detector machine claimed he'd answered a question regarding plastic surgery with deception.</p>

<p>'Have you had any cosmetic surgery done?' he was asked after being strapped up to the polygraph in a dark room.</p>

<p>'No,' the impassive host replied with a firm shake of the head - but the test examined that his answer was 'false'.   </p>

<p>The presenter and father-of-four burst out laughing as he protested that he hadn't, insisting he's only had dental work.</p>
