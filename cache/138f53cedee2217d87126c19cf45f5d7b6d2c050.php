<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When you think of Santa Claus, you are likely to picture a jolly man with rosy cheeks quietly lifting presents from an enormous sack and leaving them under a tree.</p>

<p>So perhaps it's no wonder that Bunnings has raised eyebrows with a peculiar addition to its 2020 Christmas collection: an inflatable axe-throwing Saint Nick hurling weapons at a reindeer pinned to a rotating dart board.</p>

<p>The Australian hardware giant left many scratching their heads with the launch of the $129 outdoor decoration, which stands 1.8 metres tall and looks more appropriate for Halloween than the festive season.</p>

<p>At a store in Innaloo, nine kilometres from Perth CBD, a mother was overheard saying: 'I'm horrified, but want one.'</p>

<p>Bunnings has raised eyebrows with perhaps this peculiar addition to its 2020 Christmas collection: an inflatable axe-throwing Santa hurling weapons at a reindeer pinned to a bullseye</p>

<p>The unique piece - sold exclusively in Bunnings stores and not on the brand's website - is designed for the garden and comes with 18 LED lights which illuminate at night. </p>

<p>But if an axe-wielding Father Christmas isn't quite to your taste, the retailer has plenty of other inflatable Santas engaging in a variety of activities which range from the traditional to the downright zany.</p>

<p>Options include Santa playing a saxophone, driving a forklift full of gifts, riding a shark and standing alone, watching the world go by.</p>

<p>They're all part of Bunnings 2020 festive range which was released in August to brighten the mood amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>The $129 decoration is sold exclusively in Bunnings stores and is not available online</p>

<p>The inflatable Santa is part of Bunnings special 2020 Christmas collection (pictured) which launched in late August to brighten the mood amid COVID-19</p>

<p>The collection – which is only available in select stores – includes pink reindeer, LED and fibre optic trees and giant Nutcracker soldiers that tower over a metre high.</p>

<p>A Bunnings employee from the Craigieburn outlet, 25 kilometres from Melbourne CBD, announced the launch with a Facebook photo that quickly went viral after it was posted on August 26.</p>

<p>'After the year we've had, bushfires and a pandemic (and our metro Melbourne folk still getting through), looking forward to seeing lots of seasonal lighting,' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>It's not clear which other stores are stocking the special collection, which does not appear online because it all items are promotional.</p>
