<p>Notes: 'The more we listened to expecting mothers and postpartum mothers, the more we learned, reworked and innovated through inclusive design,' shared Carmen Zolman, Nike Senior Design Director for Apparel Innovation</p>

<p>Nike (M) 'supports women during all stages of pregnancy and beyond,' the brand said.</p>

<p>'There are so many reasons that make sticking to sport difficult through pregnancy and motherhood, but we see this chapter as anything but a stopgap in a woman's journey through sport,' said Carmen Zolman, Nike Senior Design Director for Apparel Innovation.</p>

<p>'The more we listened to expecting mothers and postpartum mothers, the more we learned, reworked and innovated through inclusive design.' </p>

<p>Tried and tested, nearly 30 female athletes who were pregnant or postpartum gave designers detailed feedback on fit, feel and function.</p>

<p>The Nike (M) Collection consist of four workout essentials: a pullover, bra, tank and leggings, with items priced up to $85.</p>

<p>The line launches on the brand's website on September 17th. </p>

<p>'I loved how soft the Nike One (M) tights were and the fact that if you were a size medium before, you could be a size medium in the Nike (M) line,' said golder Michelle Wie West.  </p>

<p>Retired British track and field athlete Perri Edwards added, 'The Nike (M) sports bra is great because it’ll give me easy access for when I want to breastfeed.'</p>

<p>'The leggings give you options of wearing over your tummy or showing your tummy, and the maternity shirt has this extra material for the extra weight that I’m carrying. </p>

<p>'You look very smart, very comfortable, very hip,' Perri said. </p>

<p>As the largest supplier of athletic footwear in the world, the US based sports and fitness company has their finger forever on the global pulse.  </p>

<p>In 2017 they added athletic hijabs to their offerings for female athletes. In February, their fall/winter 2020 New York fashion show featured models of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities including Olympians, LGBTQ activists and kids. </p>
