<p>'The thing is if people really want more right wing comedy they're gong to have to vote for a left-wing government, whether you agree with it or not the job of a comedian is to cause mischief and say the unsayable, and also to flick Vs at the government.</p>

<p>'I mean honestly, we're supposed to be gargoyles, causing mischief and trouble.'</p>

<p>To emphasis his point, the comedian then waved two fingers at the camera and blew a raspberry at viewers.</p>
