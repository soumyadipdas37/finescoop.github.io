<p>Happy couple: Aaron Taylor-Johnson spent some quality time with wife Sam as they enjoyed a day at the beach with their two dogs in Malibu on Wednesday</p>

<p>Aaron was suitably dressed for his day at the beach, teaming his shorts with a dark grey T-shirt, a brown sports cap and a grey sweater tied around his waist.</p>

<p>The film star completed his relaxed look with bare feet as he enjoyed his idyllic walk home with his wife and pets.</p>

<p>Sam meanwhile echoed her husband's low-key look, opting for a loose-fitting white sweater, black shorts and brown sandals.</p>

<p>The director added a black sports cap and carried what appeared to be a bodyboard under her arm.  </p>

<p>Aaron and his wife Sam met on the set of the 2009 John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy, which Sam directed, when she was 42 and he was 18.</p>

<p>The English pair announced their engagement later that year and married in 2012 with a ceremony in Somerset, England.</p>

<p>At the time of their first collaboration, Aaron went by the surname Johnson, while Sam went by Taylor-Wood, but both adopted the married name Taylor-Johnson.</p>

<p>The lovebirds returned to collaborating in 2018 with their adaptation of James Frey's pseudo-memoir A Million Little Pieces.</p>

<p>The couple wrote the film together, making it Aaron's first credited screenwriting gig.</p>

<p>He starred in the movie as Frey, who's sent to a rehab center after suffering a serious fall while under the influence of drugs.</p>

<p>Aaron currently stars in the hotly-anticipated Christopher Nolan thriller Tenet, one of the  first big blockbuster to be released post-lockdown. </p>
