<p>In a resurfaced interview with the Courier Mail from 2017, she revealed how childhood bullying led her to embark on a weight loss journey at 15.</p>

<p>'I was 26kg heavier than I am now. There's nothing wrong with being bigger or smaller, but it's a matter of being happy,' she said.  </p>

<p>'I was huge compared to everyone else in my year and I was bullied for that, and the fact is that one in three children are bullied.'</p>

<p>The blonde shed the pounds over two years and eventually joined a modelling school at 17.</p>

<p>However, her slimmed-down physique attracted more bullying, with many people questioning just how she'd managed to drop the kilos.</p>

<p>'I then copped bullying on the other side with people saying, "Oh, she must be bulimic," but I was able to overcome that,' Gemma revealed.</p>

<p>She went on to be crowned Miss Australia Continents in 2018.</p>

<p>Gemma now works as a real estate agent on the Gold Coast.  </p>
