<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Maldives has become the first country in the world to offer a traveller loyalty rewards program.</p>

<p>The south Asian country will give points towards perks for regular visitors, it announced on Sunday.</p>

<p>Maldives Border Miles will reward tourists for regular visits, with members progressing up three tiers: Aida (Bronze), Antara (Silver) and Abaarana (Gold).</p>

<p>The three names come from Divehi, the country's main local language and the program will begin on December 1 this year, as the country seeks to draw back tourists during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The Maldives has become the first country in the world to offer a traveller loyalty rewards program</p>

<p>Points will be awarded on each border occasion, with more given for visits on special occasions, and regular visitors will earn special privileges and move up the three tiers.</p>

<p>Maldives Immigration said: 'Maldives Border Miles is a three-tiered loyalty program focused on tourism promotion. </p>

<p>'Tourists enrolled to this program will earn points for each border crossing. Additional points are rewarded for the visits on special occasions. </p>

<p>'Once the tourist reaches to a tally of a specific amount of points, privileges are rewarded with amazing benefits. </p>

<p>'As they move up the tiers, privileges are enhanced, and benefits are made exclusive.'</p>

<p>It is not yet known what perks will be given to customers but industry experts have hailed the innovative move by the country's tourism board. </p>

<p>Scott Keyes, founder of the Scott's Cheap Flights newsletter, told CNN: 'It is perhaps the most innovative move by a country's tourism board since Iceland's "free stopover en route to Europe" program.</p>

<p>'Most tourism boards focus solely on glitzy ad campaigns and Photoshopped spreads, but this campaign from Maldives is both new and unique.' </p>

<p>The Maldives was one of the first countries to reopen its borders during the coronavirus pandemic on July 15, having closed them on March 27. </p>

<p>Tourism accounts for a majority of the country's foreign exchange earnings, with around 1.7 million tourist arrivals recorded in 2019.</p>

<p>It currently requires all tourists and short term visitors to present a negative PCR test for Covid-19 on arrival.</p>

<p>The test and negative PCR certificate must be issued no more than 72 hours prior to departure.</p>

<p>Screening procedures are in place for passengers on arrival, with quarantine facilities set up to isolate any suspected cases of coronavirus. </p>
