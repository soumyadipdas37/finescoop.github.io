<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale would still be the highest paid player at Tottenham even if Real Madrid contribute half of his £500,000-a-week wages.</p>

<p>Spurs are in pole position to bring Wales star Bale back from Real in what could well be the summer's most sensational transfer deal.</p>

<p>And even if Tottenham pay just £250,000-a-week of his salary, he would leapfrog Harry Kane and Tanguy Ndombele in their top earners list.  </p>

<p>Tottenham are confident they can secure Gareth Bale's sensational return from Real Madrid </p>

<p>The Wales star spent six seasons at Spurs before a world record £86m move to Real in 2013</p>

<p>Bale would move ahead of £200,000-a-week striker Harry Kane as Tottenham's top earner </p>

<p>Bale's wages would also eclipse those of Tanguy Ndombele, who earns £160,000-a-week</p>

<p>Despite interest in the 31-year-old winger from Premier League rivals Manchester United, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is confident Bale will return to north London. </p>

<p>As Sportsmail reported on Tuesday, Real Madrid will agree to pay in excess of 50 per cent of Bale's wages in order to facilitate the deal.</p>

<p>Tottenham are believed to have explored the possibility of either a loan or a permanent deal for Bale, who has fallen out of favour with Real manager Zinedine Zidane.</p>

<p>And, as of Tuesday night, the north London club were confident they could land a player they sold for a then world record fee of £85.3million in 2013.</p>

<p>Even with the Spanish giants paying half his wages, Bale would still comfortably be the top earner at Tottenham if the deal happens. </p>

<p>Daniel Levy is engaged in negotiations with Real and Bale's representatives over his return</p>

<p>Bale has won four Champions League titles at Real but has recently fallen out of favour</p>

<p>Bale's relationship with Real manager Zinedine Zidane has become increasingly frosty</p>

<p>If Gareth Bale returns...</p>

<p>Bale £500,000 (50 per cent paid by Real Madrid)</p>

<p>Kane £200,000</p>

<p>Ndombele £160,000</p>

<p>Son £140,000</p>

<p>Alli £100,000</p>

<p>Lloris £100,000</p>

<p>If Spurs paid half his wages that would eclipse the £200,000-a-week received by star striker Harry Kane. </p>

<p>Levy ripped up the club's wage structure when England captain Kane signed a six-year contract back in June 2018 with the deal overall worth £62.4m.</p>

<p>French midfielder Tanguy Ndombele is the next biggest earner at the club in £160,000-a-week followed by South Korean forward Son Heung-min on £140,000-a-week.</p>

<p>England international Dele Alli, who could yet be heading to Real as a makeweight in the Bale deal, brings home £100,000-a-week, on par with goalkeeper and captain Hugo Lloris.</p>

<p>But Bale's salary would blow all of these players out of the water and represent a gamble on a player with a chequered injury history who fell down the pecking order at Real.</p>

<p>However, Bale helped Real win the Champions League four times during his seven seasons with the club and has scored 105 goals in 251 matches.</p>
