<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are considering Douglas Costa, Gareth Bale and Ivan Perisic as potential alternatives if they are unable to sign Jadon Sancho.</p>

<p>United retain an interest in Sancho but are currently unwilling to meet Borussia Dortmund's £108million asking price for the England winger.</p>

<p>As reported by The Telegraph, United are beginning to turn their attention to other possible options.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale is being considered by Manchester United if they are unable to sign Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Douglas Costa is another possible alternative, with Juventus reportedly willing to sell him</p>

<p>United are unwilling to match Borussia Dortmund's £108million asking price for Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Juventus winger Costa is likely to be available, with the Serie A side concerned about his injury record. </p>

<p>Bale, meanwhile, could be allowed to leave Real Madrid, with the Spanish club reportedly willing to pay half of the winger's £600,000-a-week wages in order for him to move elsewhere.</p>

<p>Ivan Perisic, who was on loan at Bayern Munich from Inter Milan last season, is another option</p>

<p>Perisic spent last season on loan at Bayern Munich, for whom he scored eight goals in 35 appearances. He is now back at Inter Milan but could be an attainable target for United.</p>

<p>United have made just one major signing so far in this transfer window, bringing in midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40million.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is eager to add a wide player before the transfer window closes next month.  </p>
