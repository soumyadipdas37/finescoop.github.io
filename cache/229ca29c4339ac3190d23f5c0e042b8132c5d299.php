<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Labor has renewed calls to treat violent right-wing extremists in the same way as members of Islamic State and other terrorist organisations.</p>

<p>Australia's domestic spy agency has revealed an alarming rise in the number of right-wing individuals and groups under its watch.</p>

<p>Up to 40 per cent of ASIO's counter-terrorism work is concentrated on thwarting the far-right threat.</p>

<p>Labor's home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally said ASIO had repeatedly warned of the real and growing threat right-wing extremists posed to Australia</p>

<p>ASIO has revealed an alarming rise in the number of right-wing individuals and groups under its watch. Up to 40 per cent of ASIO's counter-terrorism work is concentrated on thwarting the far-right threat</p>

<p>This represents a significant jump over the past four years.</p>

<p>Right-wing extremists are also using the coronavirus crisis and radicalisation techniques pioneered by Islamic State to recruit new members.</p>

<p>And yet Australia is still the odd one out among its intelligence-sharing partners in not officially proscribing any right-wing group as a terrorist organisation.</p>

<p>Putting an organisation on the terror list serves as a public warning and unlocks a suite of potential offences.</p>

<p>People can be targeted for helping groups recruit or train new members, providing support or funding, or aiding their illegal activities.</p>

<p>Labor's home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally said ASIO had repeatedly warned of the real and growing threat right-wing extremists posed to Australia.</p>

<p>'But the Morrison government is failing to take action,' she told AAP on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ms Keneally has accused the Morrison (prime minister pictured) government of 'failing to take action' when it comes to threat right-wing extremists </p>

<p>'Almost half of ASIO's counter-terrorism work is focused on right-wing extremists but the government has failed to proscribe any right-wing extremist groups here - or those overseas with links to Australia - as terrorist organisations.</p>

<p>'We cannot be left in a situation where a right-wing extremist turns their vile ideas into a dangerous, violent terror attack because the government failed to take action.'</p>

<p>Australia is the only country inside the Five Eyes intelligence network - which includes the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand - not to have labelled any right-wing extremists as terrorists.</p>
