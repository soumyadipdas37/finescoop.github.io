<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Starling has become the first British bank to introduce negative interest rates for personal account customers, though only those who hold high balances in euros will be affected.</p>

<p>Rather than charging a membership or account fee, the challenger bank will levy a monthly rate of -0.5 per cent on balances of more than €50,000 held in its euro accounts.</p>

<p>The account allows customers to hold, receive, send and spend euros and is aimed at international customers who are often paid in the currency.</p>

<p>Sub-zero: Under a negative interest rate regime, banks can charge savers to hold their deposits and hand out mortgages which reduce in value every month</p>

<p>Someone who held €51,000 in their account for a whole year would therefore be charged a negative rate on the €1,000 over the €50,000 threshold, which would amount to around €5.</p>

<p>The sub-zero rate, which will come into effect on 4 November, is one of a series of updates sent to Starling's 1.25million personal banking customers last weekend.</p>

<p>It comes a week after fellow smartphone challenger bank Monzo announced it would begin charging customers a 3 per cent fee if they withdrew more than £250 a month from cash machines after the end of October, unless they use Monzo as their main current account.</p>

<p>Starling told This is Money that fewer than 1 per cent of accountholders would incur the new negative rate, and that the change was down to the European Central Bank having charged banks 0.5 per cent to hold their deposits with it since September 2019.</p>

<p>It has had a policy of negative interest rates since 2014 but cut rates from -0.4 per cent to -0.5 per cent last year.</p>

<p>Asked why the change was announced now, a year on from that decision, a spokesman from Starling said they had wanted to see how customers used the account, launched in February 2019, first.</p>

<p>He said: 'The ECB has had an interest rate of -0.5 per cent since September 2019. This means that when customers hold euros with us, it costs us.</p>

<p>'We've decided to pass on this negative interest rate, only for large deposits over €50,000, so that customers can continue to use their account for euro transactions and benefit from our low exchange rate fees.'</p>

<p>Starling said the decision of the European Central Bank, led by Christine Lagarde, to further reduce interest rates to -0.5% last September was behind the decision</p>

<p>Kevin Mountford, co-founder of the savings platform Raisin UK, said challenger banks including Starling 'need to make a profit' and were 'looking at where they can tighten their belts'.</p>

<p>He added that the decision to apply a negative interest rate could be down to the fact that UK banks are reticent to charge fees for current accounts, owing to stiff competition.</p>

<p>Starling's euro account allows customers to transfer money from pounds into euros and send and receive it for free with an international banking number. They can also set their debit card to spend money from the account, although Starling offers fee-free spending abroad from its default sterling account anyway.</p>

<p>Initially, it was free to convert pounds to euros within Starling's app at the Mastercard exchange rate, but the bank added a 0.4 per cent fee late last year.</p>

<p>Starling also offers both euro and US dollar accounts for business customers, but applies a monthly fee of £2 and £5, respectively.</p>

<p>Central banks in Denmark (pictured) and Switzerland have also interest rates below zero</p>

<p>Since the Bank of England cut its base rate to a record low of 0.1 per cent in mid-March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, there has been speculation as to whether UK interest rates could go negative.</p>

<p>The theory is that this 'would stimulate more spending', Kevin Mountford said, by encouraging banks to get money out of the door to businesses and consumers to spend, rather than save.</p>

<p>This is because, technically, it would cost you money to save and make you money to spend on credit. </p>

<p>However Azad Zangana, senior European economist and strategist at the asset manager Schroders, wrote in a research note last month: 'The evidence from Europe does not really suggest that negative interest rates encouraged greater lending activity.</p>

<p>'In fact, lending was stagnant until the European Central Bank started its own funding for lending scheme.'</p>

<p>Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey said negative interest rates were in its 'toolbox', but analysts do not expect them to be brought in right now </p>

<p>As well as the ECB, central banks in Denmark and Switzerland have set interest rates below zero, with Denmark's third-largest lender Jyske Bank hitting the headlines when it launched a mortgage with a rate of -0.5 per cent, the world's cheapest.</p>

<p>This meant the amount a borrower owed the bank reduced each month because it deducted rather than charged interest. It wasn't free money though: the bank still profited from fees and charges.</p>

<p>The opposite is true for savers - banks could pass sub-zero interest rates onto customers by charging them to hold their deposits.</p>

<p>While Britain's biggest banks pay everyday savers as little as £1 on every £10,000 of savings already, costing them money in real terms after inflation, actually penalising them for holding their money would be unprecedented.</p>

<p>Kevin Mountford said he 'didn't see the average mum and dad saver being charged' negative rates by banks, but businesses and high net worth individuals could be, which is what happens in Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Average one-year fixed-term deposit rates offered by Germany's three largest banks are just 0.1 per cent, Raisin found, 'functionally paying the banks to keep their savings.' </p>

<p>Although Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has maintained negative rates are an option open to the Bank, he has caveated this by saying: 'There is no plan at the moment to bring it out of the toolbox and put it to work.' </p>
