<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An American backpacker who moved to New South Wales one year ago has revealed the unique Australian habits that make her swoon - from 'cute' slang to the way people text.</p>

<p>Katie Payne, 22, left Iowa in the Midwestern United States in August 2019 for a four-month stint in Newcastle, 163 kilometres north of Sydney, but enjoyed her time so much that she returned in January 2020.</p>

<p>The Northern Iowa University graduate has been living in the east coast city since then and appears to have fallen in love with the 'Aussie' way of life, if a recent video on her TikTok account is anything to go by.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Ms Payne posted a clip fawning over Australians for their 'obsession' with KFC and electronic music, slang terms and penchant for signing off messages to people they like with a line of 'kisses'. </p>

<p>She said it 'makes me die' when her Australian friends leave 'x's at the end of texts and had a similar reaction to use of the term 'lollies', which is the Australian word for candy or sweets. </p>

<p>'If you text me with an 'x' at the end of the message, I'm a die (sic). I can feel your kiss through the phone,' she says in the video.</p>

<p>She adds: 'And your love for KFC... You know we forget about that in the US. It's kind of like – 'oh, KFC' – but you guys f*****g love it, and that's cute.'</p>

<p>'All of us Australians are confused how the rest of the world doesn't sign off texts with 'x' and 'xx' when it's someone you really love,' one woman replied.</p>

<p>'Okay but Aussie KFC is unbelievably superior to any other KFC,' said a second.</p>

<p>Another KFC enthusiast added: 'That's because we have like three fast food options and Wicked Wings and Zinger burgers just happen to be superior.'</p>

<p>Others said the Australian obsession with KFC is 'probably because there's only Red Rooster as the other option for chicken'. </p>
