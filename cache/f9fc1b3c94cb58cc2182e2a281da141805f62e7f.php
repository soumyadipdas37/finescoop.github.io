<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians are set to struggle even more to get home from overseas with airlines pulling flights to deal with strict passenger caps.</p>

<p>An estimated 100,000 Aussies are stranded overseas due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, with many flights coming into Australia limited to just 30 passengers per plane.</p>

<p>Malaysia Airlines are looking to suspend flights out of Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane from October to March next year.</p>

<p>Barry Abrams, the executive director of the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia said the caps were making it unviable for international flights to go ahead, suggesting the trend of pulling flights would continue for other airlines. </p>

<p>'Fuel, crew and support costs are high for international flights, and a long-haul aircraft generally carries 250–350 passengers plus freight to cover these costs,' he said.</p>

<p>'Reducing available inbound passenger loads to 10–15 per cent of capacity cannot be considered commercially sustainable.' </p>

<p>Mr Abrams said allowing only around 500 passengers to fly into some Australian airports per week meant it was only a matter of time before flights would be suspended. </p>

<p>'At Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide airports, the small weekly caps (500–525 passengers) can be commercially unviable for international airlines, especially as this small number is intended to be spread out evenly across the week,' he said.</p>

<p>'So it's to be expected these quotas aren't being routinely filled, such that some international airlines will suspend their small number of flights into these airports, further reducing the options available for Australians to return home.'</p>

<p>The airline industry suggests international airlines will suspend flights into smaller airports around Australia to cope with the passenger caps (pictured Virgin Australia staff at Sydney Airport in April)</p>

<p>Out of the 160 international flights coming into Australia every week, Mr Abrams said each flight needed around 100 passengers on board to ensure they were commercially viable. </p>

<p>Australia closed the nation's international borders to tourists to halt the spread of COVID-19 on March 20 and told citizens overseas that they should return as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In early July, tight international arrival caps were introduced limiting the number of Australians a plane could bring into the country - only 4,000 a week.</p>

<p>This is due to Australia's commitment to strict hotel quarantine for 14 days for every returning travel, amid fears large numbers of arrivals could disrupt the complicated system.</p>

<p>It's estimated it could take up to six months to bring back all the stranded Australians. </p>

<p>There have been reports of economy passengers being bumped at the last minute for high paying business customers and planes flying with nearly empty economy sections.</p>

<p>'Since the Australian government has now decided to bring in flight restrictions/capacities, it has been almost impossible to return home,' Ms Nguyen wrote.</p>

<p>'In Sydney, it is also only 30 passengers per plane. So airlines are prioritising business passengers for those 30 seats, the only way to make money.</p>

<p>'Most of us in economy have literally had our seats taken off us and given to someone else willing to pay for a business one. It is cruel.' </p>

<p>Both Qantas and Virgin Australia have effectively paused international flights, leaving Doha based Qatar Airways as the biggest carrier of passengers into the country.</p>

<p>The airline estimates it has helped return 170,000 Australians and international travellers since March, about tenfold its nearest competitor.</p>

<p>CEO Akbar Al Baker said flights had become a 'balancing act' under arrival caps with a growing list of bumped passengers unable to be placed on a replacement flight.</p>

<p>'Many passengers will be unable to travel back to Australia for the foreseeable future,' he said.</p>
