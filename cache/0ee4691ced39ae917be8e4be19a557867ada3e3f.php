<p>Calvert-Lewin scored his second hat-trick of the season on Wednesday as Everton beat West Ham to reach the quarter-finals of the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old's performance handed England boss Southgate a timely reminder of his prowess before he selects his squad for this month's international triple header on Thursday.</p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored his second Everton hat-trick of the season against West Ham </p>

<p>Sky pundit Jamie Carragher reckons in-form Calvert-Lewin deserves an England call-up</p>

<p>And former England defender and Sky Sports pundit Carragher reckons the 23-year-old Goodison hit-man deserves to be involved for the matches with Wales, Belgium and Denmark later this month.</p>

<p>'Yes, he's good enough. He really should be knocking on the door,' Carragher told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'There isn't much competition with Harry Kane for the actual centre-forward spot.</p>

<p>'There are a lot of wide forwards, when you think of Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho.</p>

<p>'But, in terms of real strikers, now Jamie Vardy has retired from international duty, you look at Danny Ings, maybe Tammy Abraham, they've had sniffs with England before, but Calvert-Lewin is as good as those two.'</p>

<p>England head coach Gareth Southgate is poised to announce his latest squad on Thursday</p>

<p>Carragher added: 'Carlo Ancelotti has had some of the best strikers in world football at times. He's put his faith in Calvert-Lewin and it's paying off. I'm a big fan.</p>

<p>'The only thing he lacked before was goals. He held the ball up, was good aerially, provided pace, could lead the line, worked off the ball - but he needed to be more clinical in front of goal. That's what he's doing now under Ancelotti.</p>

<p>'He's hitting all the right numbers but it's very early days. It's fantastic for him now but you've also got to remember the opposition they've played against (including West Brom and Crystal Palace).'</p>

<p>Toffees boss Ancelotti also heaped praise on Calvert-Lewin after his treble against West Ham on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'He is doing a fantastic job in the moment, he is really on fire and scoring a lot of goals,' Ancelotti said. </p>

<p>'He's in a very good moment. Whether he's the best (English striker) I don't know, but I don't care. For me, for us, he is.'</p>
