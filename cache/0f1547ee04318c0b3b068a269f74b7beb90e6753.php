<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A prosthetic hand that can grip and move like a normal hand could restore over 90 per cent of functionality to people with upper-limb amputations, developers claim.  </p>

<p>A team of orthopedists, industrial designers and patients worked with scientists from the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia, Italy, on the artificial hand named Hannes.</p>

<p>The limb was designed to accurately replicate the size, weight, appearance, and natural grasping motion of a human hand to help people gain near normal control.</p>

<p>Researchers claim Hannes is ready for market and has been given regulatory approval. The team are now working to find investors to make it a reality. </p>

<p>Hannes has the ability to replicate the key biological properties of the human hand - natural and adaptable movement, levels of force and speed and grasp robustness.  </p>

<p>A prosthetic hand that can grip and move like a normal hand could restore over 90 per cent of functionality to people with upper-limb amputations, developers claim </p>

<p>The limb was designed to accurately replicate the size, weight, appearance, and natural grasping motion of a human hand to help people gain near normal control</p>

<p>Researchers claim Hannes is ready for market and has been given regulatory approval. The team are now working to find investors to make it a reality</p>

<p>It has been designed to resemble a human hand and wrist, is soft and has the ability to dynamically adapt itself to the shape of objects the wearer wants to grasp. </p>

<p>'It is uniquely similar to a human hand and, being developed directly with patients, it is of practical use,' according to its developers.</p>

<p>A pilot trial involved amputees found that the volunteers could autonomously use Hannes to perform activities linked to daily living after less than a week of training. </p>

<p>It can be worn all day and is adjustable to different upper limb impairments, according to the development team. </p>

<p>Hannes includes an array of sensors placed with a custom socket that detects the activity of any residual limb muscles in the lower or higher part of the arm.</p>

<p>These are actively contracted by the user to perform multiple movements.  </p>

<p>A mobile phone app and bluetooth connection can also be used to adjust the operating parameters of the hand - including precision and speed of movement. </p>

<p>This allows the wearer to optimise the experience to suit their own requirements rather than have a single 'one size fits all' system. </p>

<p>Hannes has been tested for durability and robustness in a setting that simulated more than one year of usage of a so called 'pro-user'.  </p>

<p>'The true intelligence of Hannes lies in the mechanical design, which is completely unique in its market sector, and it gives to the prosthesis the versatility and the movement of a natural hand,' the researchers explained.</p>

<p>'The underlying mechanism of the hand is a mechanical differential system that allows Hannes to adapt to the object being grasped by using just a single motor.'</p>

<p>Hannes has the ability to replicate the key biological properties of the human hand - natural and adaptable movement, levels of force and speed and grasp robustness</p>

<p>A mobile phone app and bluetooth connection can also be used to adjust the operating parameters of the hand - including precision and speed of movement</p>

<p>It comes in two different sizes and has been designed to work for both the right and left hand, as well as for men and women.</p>

<p>The aim was to create a hand that was as close to a human hand as possible, the developers said, adding that fingers on the hand can flex and be positioned in a natural manner, even at rest. </p>

<p>The thumb can be oriented in three different positions to replicate a wide variety of grips - including a fine grip to pick up small objects.</p>

<p>It also includes a lateral grip allowing the person to grasp thin objects, and a power grip capable of grasping and moving heavy loads.  </p>

<p>The aim was to create a hand that was as close to a human hand as possible, the developers said, adding that fingers on the hand can flex and be positioned in a natural manner, even at rest</p>

<p>'The overall grasp is efficient, robust against external conditions and natural,' according to the developers.</p>

<p>Hannes can perform a full closed grasp in less than one second and, at the same time, it can exert a maximum grasp force of 150N.</p>

<p>That is level of force well beyond other commercial and research hands, and it has an autonomy of a whole day of standard use - based on battery life. </p>

<p>The name is a tribute to Professor Johannes 'Hannes' Schmidl, technical director of the Centro Protesi Inail in the 1960s and pioneer in upper limb prosthetics. </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Science Robotics. </p>
