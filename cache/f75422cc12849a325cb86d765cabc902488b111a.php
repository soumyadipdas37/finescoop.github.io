<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle are reportedly considering loan moves for Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah and Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster this summer. </p>

<p>Steve Bruce has lost Dwight Gayle to a knee injury until at least December and only Andy Carroll has featured in recent warm-up matches for Newcastle. </p>

<p>As such, Sportsmail revealed on Sunday that the Magpies have agreed a £20m fee for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson - but Bruce is still keen to strengthen and is keeping tabs on Nketiah and Brewster and their development at their respective clubs, according to The Telegraph.  </p>

<p>Newcastle are keeping tabs on young Arsenal striker Eddie Nketiah for a potential loan deal </p>

<p>Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster is also on Newcastle's radar for a temporary deal this summer</p>

<p>Newcastle's £20mIllion offer for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has been accepted</p>

<p>Bruce is desperate for attacking reinforcements and is set to land his top target in Wilson, but he may continue to add to his squad given Gayle's long-term injury.  </p>

<p>Nketiah is currently on international duty and scored a hat-trick for England Under-21s against Kosovo last week. </p>

<p>He spent half-a-season on loan at Leeds United in the Championship last season, before being recalled after Mikel Arteta's appointment as manager at the Emirates. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old scored four goals in all competitions for Arsenal last season and was sent-off against Leicester post-lockdown.  </p>

<p>Steve Bruce looks set to land his main forward target in Wilson but could make another signing</p>

<p>Brewster, meanwhile, has scored three goals in two games in pre-season for Jurgen Klopp's side - but is yet to register in a competitive game for the Premier League champions. </p>

<p>The 20-year-old went on loan to Swansea City for the latter-half of last season, and scored an impressive 11 goals as the Swans reached the Championship play-offs. </p>

<p>Both players featured in the Community Shield last weekend, with Brewster's missed penalty in the shoot-out handing the season curtain-raiser to the Gunners at Wembley.  </p>
