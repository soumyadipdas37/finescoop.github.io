<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>At least 30 staff at a Wetherspoons pub in Liverpool have been forced to self-isolate after 12 workers have tested positive for Covid-19.</p>

<p>The outbreak among staff at the Lime Kiln in Concert Square has been reported to Public Health England by the firm.</p>

<p>Pub bosses said that they had received no reports of transmission between staff and customers, the Liverpool Echo reported.</p>

<p>They insisted that a 'rigorous implementation of hygiene standards' had been in place at the city-centre pub, which remains open.</p>

<p>At least 30 Wetherspoons staff at the Lime Kiln (above) in Concert Square, Liverpool, are being forced to self-isolate for 14 days after 12 workers tested positive for Covid-19</p>

<p>A spokesman added that it is believed a 'private event' attended by some members of staff outside work may be linked to the outbreak. </p>

<p>The Lime Kiln was told of its first two coronavirus cases among staff on September 16, with the affecting employees being told to self-isolate along with 20 others thought to have been in close contact with them.</p>

<p>Another ten positive cases among staff were identified on September 18 and 19, leading to more employees being forced into self-isolation for 14 days.</p>

<p>Close contact is being defined by JD Wetherspoon as coming within two metres of the affected person for 15 minutes or more, or coming within one metre for one minute or more, a spokesman said. </p>

<p>The spokesman said Public Health England had been told of the initial four cases and would be updated about the other positive test results.</p>

<p>The pub firm have said that they will work with health bosses if any measures are recommended.</p>

<p>NHS Test and Trace have also received the details of the workers who have tested positive after contacting the pub. </p>

<p>The spokesman said: 'A number employees attended a private event outside of work, which, we believe, may be linked to the cases. At the pub, social distancing rules are in place, which minimises risk of transmission.</p>

<p>A JD Wetherspoon spokesman said that they believe a 'private event' attended by some members of staff outside work may be linked to the outbreak</p>

<p>'We appreciate that there may be some concerns from customers, but the company has not been informed of any cases of infections being transmitted from staff to customers at the pub.</p>

<p>'We understand that all the employees who tested positive have experienced mild symptoms and we wish them well. </p>

<p>'Since reopening, Wetherspoon has operated comprehensive social distancing and hygiene practices in all its pubs.</p>

<p>'These include; reduced capacity levels, the spacing out of tables, the installation of a number of floor screens between tables and the addition of till-surround screens to the bar. Staff are conducting regular surface cleaning and numerous hand sanitisers have been installed in each pub.</p>

<p>'While it is not possible to create an entirely risk-free environment, adherence to social distancing guidelines and rigorous implementation of hygiene standards minimises the risk.'</p>
