<p>With three months left until the big day, Target Australia has re-released its pre-lit Snowy Aspen Christmas tree.</p>

<p>But the $149 artificial tree is so popular it has already sold out online and in stores.</p>

<p>The seven-foot product has stunning flocked branches with build-in lights that illuminate the gorgeous white wintery finish to the tree.</p>

<p>One shopper who was eager to get the tree up shared an image of the product to a popular Facebook group.</p>

<p>'Amazing how putting up a tree can change your mood and what a better year to do it early,' Kellie said.</p>

<p>'This is the 7ft pre-lit Snowy Aspen $149 from Target, not to be confused with the Snowy Alaskan which Target have also brought out this year.'</p>

<p>The lights also make the tree look so gorgeous some may choose to not add ornaments. </p>

<p>On the Target website, the Christmas tree has an average star rating of 4.2 out of five and many happy customers have praised the product online.</p>

<p>'Love this snowy tree, so pretty, fills the house with Christmas joy,' one person said.</p>

<p>'This tree is beautiful, [I'm] in love and cannot believe how pretty it is. I was lucky enough to find one and I'm grateful I did!' another said.</p>

<p>The seven-foot product has stunning flocked branches with build-in lights that provide a gorgeous white wintery finish to the tree - and it's so popular it's already sold out </p>

<p>'You don't need to put any ornaments on it - it's soo pretty,' another said.  </p>

<p>In previous years the tree has been just as popular among customers, with hundreds of Target stores running out of stock. </p>

<p>The product differs from other Christmas trees on the market due to its wintery style that catches the eye. </p>

<p>Dressed up with bright baubles and tinsel it looks like something the royal family might place in their lounge room, so competition is fierce. </p>

<p>In 2018, customers were posting callouts for the humble tree in their local area on Facebook and even calling the head office for information about launch dates.</p>
