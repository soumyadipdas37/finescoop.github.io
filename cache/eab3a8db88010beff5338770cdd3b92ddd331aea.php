<p>'I want Eleanor to believe she can do anything she's set her mind to,' said Helen, 'and others to see children like Eleanor should be included in every walk of life. </p>

<p>'The more you see children and adults like Eleanor on modelling campaigns, the more awareness it brings to everyone. </p>

<p>'So when we go to the park we don't get the weird stares one day. We 'd love for that to happen, for that to be more inclusive in the world.' </p>

<p>Viewers quickly took to Twitter to praise Eleanor, with one writing: 'Eleanor, just a wee beauty, little star'. </p>

<p>Down's syndrome is a genetic condition that typically causes some degree of learning disability and certain physical characteristics.</p>

<p>Symptoms include:</p>

<p>Screening tests can uncover Down's syndrome during pregnancy but are not completely accurate.</p>

<p>It is caused by an extra chromosome in a baby's cell due to a genetic change in the sperm or egg.</p>

<p>The chance of this increases according to the age of the mother.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old woman has around a one in 1,500 chance of having a baby with Down's syndrome.</p>

<p>Women in their 40s have a one in 100 chance.</p>

<p>There is no evidence women can reduce their chances of having a child with Down's syndrome.</p>

<p>Down's syndrome does not have a cure.</p>

<p>Treatment focuses on supporting the patient's development. </p>

<p>People with Down's syndrome have more chance of health complications such as heart disorders, hearing problems, thyroid issues and recurrent infections.</p>

<p>'It started off as my personal Instagram page and when Elena was born, it changed into an awareness page and I couldn't believe it.'  </p>

<p>Helen and Craig discovered Eleanor had Down's syndrome 45 minutes after her birth, and admitted that while it 'took a while to get their head around' her condition, once they 'got to know' their daughter, they began to 'forget about it'. </p>

<p>'We found out about 45 minutes after she was born,' said Helen. 'We were completely shocked. We weren't told in the worst way, but we weren't told in a good way. </p>

<p>'The doctors made us feel very upset, like we had a really long haul ahead of us and it was going to be a very difficult one, and it wasn't the worst in the world, but it wasn't a good diagnosis.' </p>

<p>The fashion shoot had to take place in a home setting due to the covid pandemic, with Eleanor photographed in her grandparents' back garden while Helen captured the snaps on her iPhone 11 Pro</p>

<p>Dad Craig, 40, also got in on the act as 'chief smile co-ordinator' by performing silly dances in the background to help keep the cheeky grins coming</p>

<p>Craig added: 'It took a little while, it was more the technical talk they used to say to us. But once we met Eleanor, it was a little bit to get your head around. Once we started to get to know Eleanor and start to spend time you start to forget about it.' </p>
