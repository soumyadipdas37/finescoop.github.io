<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Granit Xhaka believes the strong mentality of new signings Willian and Gabriel Magalhaes is already rubbing off on their new Arsenal team-mates.</p>

<p>Willian arrived on a free transfer from rivals Chelsea while Gabriel was signed from Lille for £27m, and in particular Xhaka picked out the Brazil international as a man 'who knows how to win titles'. </p>

<p>He hopes their contributions, along with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who was persuaded to sign a massive new £350,000-a-week contract at the Emirates, can see Arsenal take on the top four this season.</p>

<p>Willian has brought quality, but also a tough mentality, to Arsenal, says Granit Xhaka</p>

<p>Fellow new boy Gabriel Magalhaes (left) has also been highlighted by Xhaka for his influence</p>

<p>'With Willian and Gabriel, Arsenal brought a lot of quality and mentality into the dressing room. Willian knows how to win titles,' Xhaka said to Goal.com. </p>

<p>The Gunners finished a disappointing eighth in the Premier League last season, trailing Liverpool by 43 points and scraping into the Europa League after winning the FA Cup.</p>

<p>But Xhaka, who looked set to leave Arsenal at the beginning of last season when he reacted angrily to being booed by his own fans during Unai Emery's ill-fated reign, has set his sights higher this term.</p>

<p>'The extension with Aubameyang was an important signal for all of us - we want to go back to the Champions League,' he added.</p>

<p>The player is in confident mood and has heaped praise on manager Mikel Arteta for his smart recruitment, as well as the Spaniard's approach, which is steadily transforming Arsenal into a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>'One thing is certain, I wouldn't be in London without him,' said Xhaka.</p>

<p>Manager Mikel Arteta (right) has made smart moves in the transfer market to strengthen</p>

<p>'He was the decisive factor, with his philosophy, with his style, with his idea. I am really grateful to him for that.'</p>

<p>But after victories over Fulham and West Ham in the Premier League this season, tonight's visit to the runaway champions, Liverpool, will be a true test of how far Arsenal have come.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the club continues its pursuit of further reinforcements as they prepare a significantly improved second bid for Lyon's talented midfielder Houssem Aouar.</p>

<p>The Gunners are determined to sign the 22-year-old this summer and are set to raise their dismissed £32m offer to £36.5m with a further £9m in bonuses in a hope to secure their man, according to football.london. </p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's new contract will boost Arsenal's bid for a top-four finish</p>
