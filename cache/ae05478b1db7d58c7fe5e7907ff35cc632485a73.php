<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny says he can now breathe unaided a month after he was allegedly poisoned with the nerve agent Novichok. </p>

<p>'Hello, this is Navalny,' he said in a post on Instagram, appearing with his family in the Berlin hospital where he was flown for treatment after falling ill.</p>

<p>'Yesterday I was able to breathe on my own all day,' he said in his first social media post since he was poisoned in Siberia.</p>

<p>Doctors at the Charite hospital say Navalny's condition 'continues to improve', announcing yesterday that he was able to leave his bed for short periods.    </p>

<p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - pictured in a new Instagram post - is being treated at a German hospital after being poisoned with Novichok</p>

<p>Friends of Navalny have suggested his tea was spiked in an airport cafe in Tomsk where he was pictured shortly before boarding a flight on August 20.  </p>

<p>After Navalny fell ill, the aircraft made an emergency landing in Omsk and he was initially taken to hospital in the Siberian city. </p>

<p>The following weekend he was airlifted to Berlin, where doctors at the Charite hospital treated him with the antidote atropine and kept him in a medically induced coma. </p>

<p>On September 2, the German government announced that a military lab had found evidence of Novichok, the Soviet-era nerve agent used to target Sergei Skripal in Salisbury in 2018.    </p>

<p>Western leaders have piled pressure on Russia to explain how Navalny was poisoned, but the Kremlin has denied involvement and played down Germany's findings.  </p>

<p>Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. </p>

<p>He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. </p>

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia's arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.   </p>
