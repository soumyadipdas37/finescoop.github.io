<p>Sergei Torop, 59, known as Vissarion, who claims he is the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, has been detained for two months in pretrial custody by a Russian court</p>

<p>Torop is a former Red Army conscript who claimed he was reborn in 1990 as the literal reincarnation of the son of God (pictured in 2009)</p>

<p>Two other leaders of his Church of the Last Testament, Vadim Redkin (pictured), a former rock star, and Vladimir Vedernikov, have also been placed in pre-trial detention</p>

<p>'Torop will be placed in custody for two months, until November 22,' said Judge Alla Veselykh at a court in Novosibirsk, Siberia's largest city.</p>

<p>The group's leaders are accused of using their followers' money to make profit.</p>

<p>They face up to 12 years in jail if convicted.</p>

<p>The wispy-haired 'Jesus', aged 59, was held on Tuesday in a military-style raid on his Sun City religious headquarters in a Siberian village 2,600 miles east of Moscow.</p>

<p>A picture emerged today showing a suicide note and a hangman's rope - seen as part of the evidence alleging his followers were harmed.</p>

<p>Torop today rejected the accusations against him which were itemised by the Russian Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FSB.</p>

<p>He questioned the words of the alleged victims, claiming he had never seen some of them.</p>

<p>'I have never seen one of them and I saw another one 15 years ago. In the past three years, three of these people have been constantly creating some difficulties and lodging their complaints,' he said.</p>

<p>Redkin called for human rights organisations to help the sect.</p>

<p>The operation to arrest him (pictured) appeared to involve the Russian National Guard, a force under the command of Vladimir Putin, but also involved the FSB security service</p>

<p>He claimed the complainers had 'mental disorders' and should not be believed by law enforcement.</p>

<p>'I live in the taiga, on the land,' he said.</p>

<p>'There I have a wife and three small children, underaged children. It will now be very very hard for them.'</p>

<p>The operation to detain Torop involved four helicopters and dozens of heavily armed officers from the Russian National Guard, a force under the command of Vladimir Putin, the FSB security service and the Investigative Committee.</p>

<p>Redkin, Torop's main aide who was pictured being carried away by police, called for human rights organisations to help the sect</p>

<p>Videos released by sect members showed masked special forces Spetsnaz officers with combat machine guns at the group's territory in remote Kuraginsky district of Krasnoyarsk region in Siberia.</p>

<p>Other officers were in plain clothes.</p>

<p>The group - who are banned from smoking and alcohol - has been in Siberia for years and it is unclear why the Russian authorities acted now in an early morning raid.</p>

<p>He claims to have 5,000 followers of whom several hundred live in wooden huts in the remote 'Sun City' camp at Petropavlovka, some 2,600 miles east of Moscow.</p>

<p>Armed troops are pictured during the raid in Siberia on Tuesday, with dog handlers also present</p>

<p>One estimate said there were 90 families at the site raided today by the authorities.</p>

<p>Other followers of the 'messiah' live in villages nearby.</p>

<p>He heads what is known as the Church of the Last Testament, and he has written a ten volume 'sequel to the Bible'.</p>

<p>Three years ago the cult leader told the BBC: 'We have a school of noble maidens here.</p>

<p>'We're preparing girls to become future wives, future brides for worthy men.</p>

<p>Vladimir Vedernikov (pictured yesterday) was also arrested and escorted out by officers during the raid</p>

<p>'She has to understand not to rise above the man, not to be proud of her independence but to be shy, inconspicuous and weak.'</p>

<p>He is reported to have two wives with six children.</p>

<p>He rejected his first wife, marrying a 19 year old who had lived with him since the age of seven.</p>

<p>He lives in a comfortable chalet while his followers reside in wooden huts in one of Russia's coldest regions with temperatures sinking to minus 50C in winter.</p>

<p>Torop had an awakening after he was fired as a night shift traffic cop in the Siberian town of Minusinsk, he has claimed.</p>

<p>Torop claims to have 5,000 followers of whom several hundred live in wooden huts in the remote 'Sun City' camp at Petropavlovka, some 2,600 miles east of Moscow</p>

<p>God had sent him to Earth to teach mankind about the evils of war and the havoc we were wreaking on the environment, he claimed.</p>

<p>The cult leader abolished Christmas, replacing it with the anniversary of the date of his own first sermon, August 18.</p>

<p>He claims that Mary, mother of Jesus, is his own mother.</p>

<p>Official records show his biological mother was called Nadyezhda.</p>

<p>He has followers in Germany and several other European countries.</p>
