<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A US activist investor has wagered £115million on a stake in William Hill, fuelling speculation that it could push for a sale of the British bookmaker. </p>

<p>HG Vora Capital Management, a New York hedge fund founded by Parag Vora, has built a 5.1 per cent stake in the FTSE250 company. </p>

<p>The swoop stoked speculation that HG Vora could push for a sale of William Hill, having done the same at other US casino groups.</p>

<p>Swoop: HG Vora Capital Management has built a 5.1 per cent stake in the FTSE250 company</p>

<p>In 2018, HG Vora took a 5 per cent stake in Caesars Entertainment, the casino group behind Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, and pushed for the company to explore options including a sale. Less than a year later, it was sold to Eldorado Resorts for £13.6billion.</p>

<p>The enlarged company – renamed Caesars Entertainment – is William Hill's US partner. </p>

<p>News of the stake emerged on the day it was revealed that William Hill's sports betting apps and odds would feature on US cable giant ESPN after it struck a deal with Caesars. </p>

<p>HG Vora previously invested in both Penn National Gaming and Pinnacle Entertainment before they agreed to merge. </p>

<p>UK gambling firms have sought to cash in on a gold rush in the US after it began to legalise sports betting in 2018. So far nearly 20 states have given it the green light. </p>

<p>HG Vora has a 10 per cent stake in Gamesys, the UK-listed owner of Jackpotjoy and other online gambling brands. </p>

<p>HG Vora did not respond to requests for comment. </p>
