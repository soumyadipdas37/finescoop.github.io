<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Southgate was given more cause for concern 24 hours before England were due to play Denmark on Tuesday when Danny Ings and Kieran Trippier clashed in training.</p>

<p>Ings and Trippier bashed heads after colliding when taking part in a routine training drill.</p>

<p>Both required medical attention as midfielders Mason Mount and Kalvin Phillips also checked on them.Â </p>

<p>Ings and Trippier couldn't get out of the way of each other as they clashed heads</p>

<p>Striker and right back collapsed after the collision as the training session went on around them</p>

<p>The England pair required medical attention but soon got back to their feet to carry on training</p>

<p>But while they needed a couple of minutes to compose themselves, both got back to their feet to continue the session and they are also fit to play in England's Nations League game in Copenhagen.Â </p>

<p>Confirmation of them being fit to start didn't stop some on Twitter suggesting they would be better off not bothering.</p>

<p>Bart Hobson tweeted: 'I'm going to suggest that they don't play tonight, not our of fear for their safety, but because of their lack of self awareness!'</p>

<p>'Oh please just get up it's embarrassing, I know footballers are soft but their making a meal of it. There's five-year-olds that wouldn't make this much fuss,' added Lewis Butler.Â Â Â </p>

<p>The incident happened on the same day it emerged Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden had been sent home for trying to smuggle two women into England's team hotel room following a 1-0 victory over Iceland at the weekend.</p>

<p>'Southgate's England summed up,' wrote another on Twitter, which was followed by: 'England team is like a circus.'</p>
