<p>The challenge involves using different sized coke bottles as piggy banks, which can save users as much as $3,000 </p>

<p>Instead of throwing in any loose change, the hack is centred around using $2 coins to maximise savings opportunities. </p>

<p>Images show a 600ml bottle full of coins can save as much as $1,000.</p>

<p>While a 1.25L bottle can hold $1,000 and a 2L bottle just under $3,000.</p>

<p>But the trick relies on users filling the bottle all the way to the top.</p>

<p>The hack is being used by a number of crafty Australians to get ahead of the expensive holiday season, reported 7 News. </p>

<p>'I'm doing one for Christmas and have already filled half a 2L bottle in a month or two,' one wrote.</p>

<p>'Love this for Christmas money, starting today,' another said. </p>
