<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A school principal has slammed the Queensland government for asking her to treat her students worse than prisoners by forcing them into solitary confinement for two weeks.</p>

<p>Linda Evans, the head of Fairholme College in Toowoomba, said the demand to make 12-year-old borders quarantine when they return after school holidays interstate is inhumane.</p>

<p>'To place a child in a room on their own and bring meals to their doors constitutes solitary confinement. We don't treat our prisoners that way we won't treat our children that way,' she told Sunrise. </p>

<p>Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan will today host a meeting with state education ministers on the issue. </p>

<p>Australian Boarding Schools Association chief executive Richard Stokes wants the quarantine requirements to be scrapped. </p>

<p>'They need to go home and see their parents but they can't even get a hug from mum,' he said.</p>

<p>'They will come back and live in an individual room and bathroom and be fed a meal in their room for two weeks.</p>

<p>'It is criminal to do that to an 11-year-old, or to a 17-year-old doing their first ATAR exam.' </p>
