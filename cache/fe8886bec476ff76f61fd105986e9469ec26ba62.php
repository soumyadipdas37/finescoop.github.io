<p>'Does your hair go curly?' she asked Carlin, who replied that it was 'always curly'. </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Carlin shared an old Facebook post from 2017 where he mused about what it would be like to find The One. </p>

<p>Underneath the lengthy post, Carlin answered his former self by asking: 'OK 2017 Carlin... but I'm still single,' alongside the shrugging emoji.  </p>

<p>In July Angie revealed that she and Carlin had called it quits after 10 months of dating.</p>

<p>She revealed that they parted ways because their 'values didn't align'.    </p>

<p>Compliment: 'It's perfect now!' Andi told him enthusiastically, and Carlin bashfully played down the compliment, saying he used a lot of product keeping it straight</p>

<p>Andi, who last year said that she had been single for six years, was last linked to Love Island star Eden Dally in November. </p>

<p>The pair were spotted together at the Maxim Hot 100 party sparking talk of a possible date.</p>

<p>However, Andi rubbished claims the pair are together saying they are 'only friends' after meeting at Mr World 2019.</p>

<p>Eden is currently dating  Cyrell Paule, and the pair share a son together, Boston, who they welcomed in February 2020. </p>
