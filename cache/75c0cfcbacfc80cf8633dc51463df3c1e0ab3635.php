<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Neurologists are to start treating Alzheimer's patients by sending electrical currents deep into their brain.</p>

<p>A team at Imperial College London and the UK Dementia Research Institute have been given a $1.5million (£1.14million) grant by US philanthropists, including Bill Gates, to trial the technology.</p>

<p>Researchers have selected 24 patients with early-stage Alzheimer's to undergo the therapy, which will involve two weeks of daily hour-long sessions.</p>

<p>After dozens of failed trials for dementia drugs, experts have high hopes for this new method.</p>

<p>The technology – called temporal interference brain stimulation – involves applying electrodes to the scalp.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The electrodes then send two harmless high-frequency beams into the brain.</p>

<p>These beams are of slightly different frequencies – 2,000 Hz and 2,005 Hz – and when they cross they create a third current, a low-frequency wave of 5 Hz.</p>

<p>And it is this new wave which researchers hope will make all the difference.</p>

<p>It will be triggered in the hippocampus – an area deep in the brain responsible for forming new memories. This will hopefully revive the area's mitochondria, the energy source in every cell, which become damaged by Alzheimer's.</p>

<p>The two original beams are at too high a frequency to interfere with the healthy brain tissue through which they pass.</p>

<p>But the new wave will have the same frequency at which brain cells fire – allowing it to spark diseased neurones back into action.</p>

<p>Tests on healthy volunteers shows the technique increases blood flow to the brain and results in improved results in facial-recognition tests. But the new trial, which will start in January, will be the first time patients with Alzheimer's undergo the treatment.</p>

<p>A team at Imperial College London and the UK Dementia Research Institute have been given a $1.5million (£1.14million) grant by US philanthropists, including Bill Gates (pictured), to trial the technology</p>

<p>Researcher Dr Nir Grossman said: 'There is more and more evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in Alzheimer's disease.</p>

<p>'This is an important milestone for us, concluding years of work on a breakthrough technological development.'</p>

<p>Some 850,000 people in the UK suffer with dementia, of whom 500,000 have the Alzheimer's form of the disease.</p>

<p>The trial is one of 16 given grants by the $60million (£46million) Part the Cloud programme – a scheme funded by philanthropists Bill Gates and Mikey Hoag, and the US Alzheimer's Association.</p>

<p>Microsoft billionaire Mr Gates has spoken of witnessing the effects of the disease first-hand and said finding a treatment 'needs increased and continued research investments'.</p>
