<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The number of whistleblowing reports about potential tax evasion have surged by 10 per cent. </p>

<p>Around 73,000 tips were sent online to HM Revenue &amp; Customs in the year to March 31 – up from 66,000 in 2019.</p>

<p>Accounting group UHY Hacker Young, which compiled the data, said the rise was partly down to tax evasion increasingly being seen as unacceptable behaviour.</p>

<p>Around 73,000 tax evasion whistleblowing reports were sent online to HM Revenue &amp; Customs in the year to March 31 – up from 66,000 in 2019</p>

<p>Another factor is likely to be tighter rules on accountants and other advisers to report all possible cases. </p>

<p>The figures are expected to increase dramatically in the wake of the furlough scheme.</p>

<p>Thousands of reports have already been sent in alleging employers have fraudulently claimed furlough money. </p>

<p>Sean Glancy, of UHY Hacker Young, said: ‘It appears that more people than ever are choosing to report a neighbour, employer or business partner for tax evasion.</p>

<p>‘The financial pressure some people have been under may have affected whether they report someone they know.’</p>
