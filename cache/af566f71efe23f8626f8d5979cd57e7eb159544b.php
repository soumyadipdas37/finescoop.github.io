<p>However, it has now been revealed that the 'amateur' contestants leave their completed homes with significant issues which have to be repaired by professional tradesmen.</p>

<p>Highlighting matters such as repainting, ruptured tiling and improperly assembled products, a former tradie tells Woman's Day: 'As soon as homes sell, we're told to go in and correct all the mistakes that were made'. </p>

<p>'The rooms are not to a liveable standard': It has now been revealed that the 'amateur' contestants on The Block leave their completed homes with significant issues which have to be repaired by professional tradesmen. Pictured are Harry and Tash</p>

<p>It's added that as soon as the couples are done with renovating their homes, 'sneaky' producers hire a group of tradies to go in and fix the problems.</p>

<p>A tradie from previous seasons went as far to say he is regularly left incredulous at the state of the 'completed' home.</p>

<p>'There's always so much we need to correct. There's no way they can complete these rooms to a liveable standard in the amount of time they're given, particularly the bathrooms.'</p>

<p>He added that while the judges, Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer, merely judge the 'aesthetics' of the rooms, if he assessed the contestants' work they would 'get the lowest scores in terms of functionality'.</p>

<p>'We're told to go in and correct all the mistakes': A former tradie has revealed that contestants leave behind issues such as repainting, ruptured tiling and improperly assembled products. Pictured is judge Darren Palmer </p>

<p>The reports comes after The Block was rocked by a cheating scandal. </p>

<p>Sunday night's episode saw judge Shaynna award Luke and Jasmin the perfect score of ten for their 1910-themed children's room and en-suite - only to later realise she had seen the exact design elsewhere.  </p>

<p>Speaking to TV WEEK, the 57-year-old explained: 'I thought, "I'm just going to have a look" – and I found an identical one. There are one or two teeny-tiny tweaks, but it's literally a carbon copy!'</p>

<p>'There's always so much we need to correct': A tradie from previous seasons went as far to say he is regularly left incredulous at the state of the 'completed' home. Pictured are Jimmy and Tam</p>

<p>The interior designer fumed: "We're not into copy-and-pasting. And not only that, it takes months and expertise to put all that together – the research, actually finding all those pieces.</p>

<p>Jasmin, 36, was quick to deny the cheating claims, telling the publication that the design of the room was a product of a moodboard she had created.</p>

<p>She also claimed that if she were to cheat, she 'wouldn't have done it so openly'.</p>

<p>Brutal! He added that while the judges, Shaynna Blaze, Neale Whitaker and Darren Palmer [all pictured[, merely judge the 'aesthetics' of the rooms, if he assessed the contestants' work they would 'get the lowest scores in terms of functionality'</p>
