<p>All the money was stolen on Sunday night when a robber cut the power to the cafe and broke in</p>

<p>Maddison Houston, 5, had raised the money by doing chores and selling strawberries at her mother's cafe, Whistlestop at Pimpama, on the Gold Coast</p>

<p>He took all of Maddison's hard earned cash as well as the business' weekly takings.</p>

<p>The five-year-old said she would have done the thief a favour if they hadn't taken all her money. </p>

<p>'I would take you in the Ferrari if you didn't steal my money,' she told 7News.</p>

<p>'Give me back my money, because it's not your money. I made it for my business.'</p>

<p>Only the man's silhouette was caught on CCTV before he cut the power to the entire store and broke his way in.</p>

<p>Maddison described the thief as a 'grown up' who kicked the door and left a shoe print before 'grabbing stuff without asking'.</p>

<p>The family business has been robbed six times since it has been owned by Maddison's mother, Sarah Degen.</p>

<p>'What sucks is that I put in a lot of time and I sacrifice a lot of my time with my family and my children,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Degen took to Facebook once she realised an entire week worth of work was stolen from her.</p>

<p>'We got broken into last night!' the devastated mother wrote. </p>

<p>'We are absolutely gutted after such a hard week now everything is gone!</p>

<p>'To you low lives we work seven days a week, 20 plus hour days so our kids can have a better future...you stole from our children...hope it’s worth it!' </p>

<p>Queensland Police are investigating the break-in. </p>
