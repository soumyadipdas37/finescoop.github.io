<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty faced backlash over the 'herd immunity' strategy in March and asked for help to 'calm down' angry academics, emails show.</p>

<p>The top experts leading Britain out of its Covid-19 crisis had a hard time backtracking from comments they made about the controversial strategy at the start of the pandemic. </p>

<p>On at least three occasions, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific advisor, suggested to media outlets the 'aim is to... build up some degree of herd immunity', meaning around '60 per cent' of people would need to be infected.  </p>

<p>Emails obtained by the BBC reveal the alarm among the government's top scientific advisers after academics reacted in horror to Sir Patrick's words.</p>

<p>Sir Patrick wrote to a colleague, 'anything you can do to calm our academic friends down over herd immunity would be greatly appreciated'. </p>

<p>Professor Whitty, the chief medical officer, also raged in emails he was 'misinterpreted' after an unnamed senior politician claimed he had conversations with Professor Whitty in January that 'were absolutely focused on herd immunity'.  </p>

<p>Herd immunity aims for most of the population to catch the coronavirus, and build up some form of immunity to it. But it will inevitably come at the cost of people's lives.</p>

<p>Scientists are torn over whether herd immunity is a good strategy, because some say it may be the only route out this crisis and end damaging draconian lockdowns.</p>

<p>Health chiefs in Sweden, one of the only countries to have shunned a lockdown, say the strategy has 'worked' for them, and people have returned to some form of normality.</p>

<p>There is speculation London already has some form of protection against the virus because it has not experienced a spike in cases recently like other parts of England. </p>

<p>Sir Patrick Vallance and Professor Chris Whitty faced backlash over the 'herd immunity' strategy in March and asked for help to 'calm down' angry academics, emails show</p>

<p>A group of more than 500 academics published a joint letter to the Government warning that 'going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option. Sir Patrick discussed this letter in emails and told a colleague, 'anything you can do to calm our academic friends down over herd immunity would be greatly appreciated'</p>

<p>In April Professor Whitty discussed an 'annoying' claim that he had spoken with an unnamed senior politician who says the conversation was 'absolutely focused on herd immunity'</p>

<p> Herd immunity was first publicly mentioned by Sir Patrick  at the first Downing Street press conference on Covid-19 designed to inform the public on the impending crisis.</p>

<p>He said on March 12: 'Our aim is not to stop everyone getting it, you can't do that. And it's not desirable, because you want to get some immunity in the population. We need to have immunity to protect ourselves from this in the future.'</p>

<p>The next day, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'Our aim is to try and reduce the peak - not suppress it completely, also because most people get a mild illness, to build up some degree of herd immunity whilst protecting the most vulnerable.'</p>

<p>He spoke on Sky News later that day about not suppressing the virus completely, to help avoid 'a second peak,' and also to 'allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this'.</p>

<p>When asked how much of the British population would need to contract the virus for herd immunity to become effective, he calmly replied 'probably around 60 per cent'.</p>

<p>The following day, a group of more than 500 academics published a joint letter to the Government warning that 'going for 'herd immunity' at this point does not seem a viable option, as this will put the NHS at an even stronger level of stress, risking many more lives than necessary'. </p>

<p>It also criticised the lack of social distancing restrictions imposed by the government, as the theory of herd immunity appeared to explain the government's reluctance to order a lockdown.</p>

<p>Emails obtained by the BBC via a Freedom of Information Act request now reveal the fall-out of those comments made by Sir Patrick.</p>

<p>In response to an email titled 'Covid-19 and herd immunity', from an academic, he writes brusquely 'No it is NOT the plan'. He does not, however, explain his previous references to herd immunity</p>

<p>The emails obtained by the BBC consist of every email sent by Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty from the start of February to the start of June, containing the words 'herd immunity'. Pictured is an example of a conversation</p>

<p>Professor Whitty said the situation where herd immunity would be aimed for would be with a vaccine </p>

<p>Professor Whitty also said: 'The statement that it was government policy deliberately to go for herd immunity is simply wrong'</p>

<p>The chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said at a press conference on March 12, designed to inform the public on the impending Covid-19 crisis: 'Our aim is not to stop everyone getting it, you can't do that. And it's not desirable, because you want to get some immunity in the population. We need to have immunity to protect ourselves from this in the future.' </p>

<p>On March 13, Sir Patrick Vallance said: 'Our aim is to try and reduce the peak - not suppress it completely, also because most people get a mild illness, to build up some degree of herd immunity whilst protecting the most vulnerable.'</p>

<p>He spoke on Sky News later that day about not suppressing the virus completely, to help avoid 'a second peak,' and also to 'allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this'.</p>

<p>When asked how much of the British population would need to contract the virus for herd immunity to become effective, he calmly replied 'probably around 60%'.</p>

<p>With an approximate 1% case fatality rate, the interviewer responded, that would mean 'an awful lot of people dying'.</p>

<p>In one email from April, Professor Chris Whitty confers with colleagues about a report in the Times newspaper - in which an unnamed senior politician says he had conversations with Prof Whitty in January that 'were absolutely focused on herd immunity'. He said he had been misinterpreted. </p>

<p>In a Channel 4 documentary aired in June, Italy's deputy health minister claimed Boris Johnson had told Italy that he wanted to pursue it. </p>

<p>The Cabinet Office denied the claims made in the documentary and said: 'The Government has been very clear that herd immunity has never been our policy or goal.'</p>

<p>The material consists of every email sent by Sir Patrick and Professor Whitty from the start of February to the start of June, containing the words 'herd immunity'. </p>

<p>After the letter backed by hundreds of scientists, Sir Vallance emailed Sir Mark Walport, the UK's former chief scientific adviser, clearly rattled.</p>

<p>He said the response should be 'herd immunity is not the strategy. The strategy is 'to flatten the curve… and to shield the elderly… As we do this we will see immunity in the community grow'. </p>

<p>In response to an email titled 'Covid-19 and herd immunity', from an academic, he writes brusquely 'No it is NOT the plan'. He does not, however, explain his previous references to herd immunity.</p>

<p>On the same weekend, he writes to a colleague, 'anything you can do to calm our academic friends down over herd immunity would be greatly appreciated'.</p>

<p>The emails reveal herd immunity was under discussion as early as January.</p>

<p>An unnamed senior politician says he had conversations with Professor Whitty in January that 'were absolutely focused on herd immunity', The Times reported. </p>

<p>Professor Whitty discussed this 'annoying' claim with colleagues in April, and complained he had been misrepresented by a 'conveniently unnamed' minister.</p>

<p>He stated he never thought herd immunity 'was actually a sensible aim of policy', but suggesting the concept was talked about when answering 'questions put to me by ministers'.</p>

<p>In another email to the president of the Faculty of Public Health, which sets standards for health professionals - who had raised questions about the lack of testing - Prof Whitty insisted 'the government had never pursued a "herd immunity strategy'''.</p>

<p>The BBC said a government spokesman said the emails 'make clear… herd immunity has never been a policy aim' - an response that has repeatedly put forward.</p>

<p>Although a contentious issue, herd immunity is indeed backed by some scientists who argue it is a better way out of this crisis than crippling lockdowns.</p>

<p>There is no indication that any country in the world has developed herd immunity yet, based on antibody studies.</p>

<p>But in places severely battered by the disease, infectious disease specialists have speculated that there is some level of protection.</p>

<p>Many scientists are convinced London has a layer of protection that has stopped it from experiencing the second 'wave' seen in other parts of England.</p>

<p>Professor Anthony Brookes, Department of Genetics and Genome Biology, University of Leicester, told MailOnline: 'We haven’t got a second wave in London. It’s apparent in the Government data. It’s only outside London, especially in the North.</p>

<p>'How can that be happening? It’s not a distortion of increased testing. It has to be because in London they’ve got essentially herd immunity and now it is stopping this second wave.</p>

<p>'It [the virus] never spread that much in the north before lockdown, so they haven’t had a chance to get herd immunity yet. That’s why they are seeing this "second wave" – although it is not that.'</p>

<p>Evidence is mounting that Sweden has beaten the coronavirus epidemic with herd immunity rather than lockdowns. The country decided to use only a handful of restrictions, including banning mass gatherings and encouraging people to work and study from home. </p>

<p>Dr Anders Tegnell, who has guided the nation through the pandemic without calling for a lockdown, claimed on July 21: 'The epidemic is now being slowed down, in a way that I think few of us would have believed a week or so ago.</p>

<p>'It really is yet another sign that the Swedish strategy is working.'   </p>

<p>And Kim Sneppen, professor of biocomplexity at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen and renowned expert on the spread of disease, told Denmark’s Politiken newspaper this week: 'There is some evidence that the Swedes have built up a degree of immunity to the virus which, along with what else they are doing to stop the spread, is enough to control the disease. Perhaps, the epidemic is over there.' </p>

<p>Scientific consensus says herd immunity — when a disease can no longer spread because enough of the population has been exposed to it — will kick in when around 60 to 70 per cent have had the virus, scientifically called SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>But some research has suggested this rate could actually be as low as 10 per cent, if it spreads more rampantly among the most socially active. This is because they are into contact with others more regularly and are, therefore, more likely to spread the illness.</p>

<p>If a vaccine was developed it would need 60-70 per cent coverage to work — but this threshold could be significantly lower for natural immunity.   </p>

<p>Sir Patrick warned this week that the 'vast majority' of Britain is still susceptible to catching Covid-19 because immunity is so low.</p>

<p>Government advisors believe that no more than 8 per cent of the population have developed neutralizing antibodies against the coronavirus. </p>

<p>Eight per cent of Britain — home to around 66.65million people — equates to around 5.3million people but Sir Patrick said the figure was closer to 3million. </p>

<p>The rate could actually be even higher in London and other cities, saying as many as 17 per cent of people living in the capital may have already had the illness. </p>

<p>Sir Patrick said these higher rates could mean the disease spreads slower in highly-populated areas in a second wave.</p>

<p>In a stark warning, Sir Patrick said: 'It means the vast majority of us are not protected in any way and are susceptible to this disease.'</p>

<p>Professor Brookes said: 'When Vallance said the vast majority of people are still vulnerable, that is totally unjustifiable.'</p>

<p>That's because it is known that antibodies can wane over time - research by King's College London in July found immunity to Covid-19 might be lost within months -therefore antibody testing will not flag everyone who has ever had the disease. </p>

<p>Sir Vallance admitted the 8 per cent was likely an underestimate, and said there may be 'other forms of protection' in the immune system.</p>

<p>Other studies have offered hope of long-lasting immunity, with survivors of SARS — a closely-related coronavirus — still having crucial T cells 17 years after they were first infected.</p>

<p>The crucial white blood cells — which can't be detected by the 'have you had it' antibody tests — are also made in response to the infection.</p>

<p>Other scientific studies have shown people who have had a common cold in the past two years have T cells that show 'cross-reactive protection' against Covid-19.</p>

<p>It means the true proportion of the population who is protected against the disease is a mystery. </p>
