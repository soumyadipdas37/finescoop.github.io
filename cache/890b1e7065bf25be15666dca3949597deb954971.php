<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton said his heart was in his mouth as he survived a major scare to put his Mercedes on pole for Sunday's potentially historic Russian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>The British driver will start at the front of the grid in Sochi as he attempts to equal Michael Schumacher's victory record with his 91st career triumph.</p>

<p>But Hamilton came within a single second of qualifying only 15th after his afternoon was plunged into jeopardy following Sebastian Vettel's crash.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton endured a major scare to put Mercedes in pole again for Sunday's Russian GP</p>

<p>The quadruple world champion's accident at the fourth corner led to the action being halted in Q2 with two minutes and 15 seconds remaining.</p>

<p>Hamilton had failed to post a time - his earlier lap chalked off by the stewards for exceeding track limits.</p>

<p>With Vettel's damaged Ferrari removed, the remaining cars lined up in the pit lane. Hamilton was eighth in the queue ahead of the manic dash to beat the clock.</p>

<p>The reigning world championÂ came within a single second of qualifying only 15th in Sochi</p>

<p>Sebastian Vettel's nasty crash at the fourth corner had led to the action being halted in Q2</p>

<p>Leaving the pits, Hamilton ran wide on cold tyres. He was then blocked by Renault's Daniel Ricciardo at the penultimate corner.</p>

<p>Hamilton's race engineer gave his driver the hurry-up.</p>

<p>'Need to go, need to go, need to go,' the usually serene Pete Bonnington yelled over the radio, and - with just one second left - Hamilton crossed the line to start a new lap. He finished fourth and a crisis was averted.</p>

<p>A re-booted Hamilton then returned in Q3, posting a dazzling track record at the Sochi Autodrom to obliterate his rivals, finishing more than half-a-second clear of Red Bull's Max Verstappen and six tenths ahead of Valtteri Bottas in the other Mercedes to secure pole 96 of his blockbuster career.</p>

<p>'I had my heart in my mouth the whole way,' said Hamilton, 35. 'It was one of the hardest qualifying sessions that I can remember. It was horrible.</p>

<p>Hamilton was eighth in the queue ahead of the manic dash to beat the clock but edged in</p>

<p>'Everything was so rushed. There was panic, all sorts of things going on.</p>

<p>'I had to calm myself down, find my centre, calm my heart down. I wanted to deliver in Q3. I was adamant that I had no other choice. I had to deliver on those two laps, and I needed a perfect lap to get the pole.</p>

<p>'We are all under immense pressure and I would say experience helps massively in order to know how to regain your focus.'</p>

<p>It marked another hugely-impressive chapter of the Briton's career - one which will see him hang up his crash helmet as the most decorated driver the sport has ever seen.</p>

<p>Hamilton is now expected to reach Schumacher's landmark on Sunday with Russian president Vladimir Putin potentially in town to witness a rewrite of the sport's record books.</p>

<p>The rejuvenated Hamilton then returned in Q3 and went on to post a dazzling track record</p>

<p>But it is unlikely to be straightforward for the six-time world champion who will be on a less-desirable strategy than his rivals.</p>

<p>Hamilton will start on the soft rubber - a cumulative effect of his Q2 drama - while Verstappen and Bottas will be on the more durable tyres.</p>

<p>Hamilton will also be exposed on the 900-metre chase down to the opening corner, the longest run of the year.</p>

<p>'It is not a good place to start,' added Hamilton. 'There is a greater tow on this year's cars so I expect at least one of Valtteri or Max to come flying by at some point. I am just going to run the fastest race I can.</p>

<p>Hamilton was summoned to see the stewards after rejoining the track at the second corner</p>

<p>'We will figure out this evening if there is a different type of race I can do to keep my position.'</p>

<p>Hamilton was summoned to see the stewards on Saturday evening for failing to follow the rules when he rejoined the track at the second corner in the opening minutes.</p>

<p>The Mercedes star avoided further action but was told he will be dealt a five-second penalty in Sunday's race if he repeats the same manoeuvre.</p>
