<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Playing the upcoming NFL season amid the coronavirus outbreak will be 'survival of the fittest,' according to Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who insists he's unconcerned about the health risks: 'If I die, I die.'</p>

<p>Cousins made the remarks on the 10 Questions podcast to host Kyle Brandt, saying that he is at 'peace' with the dangers of playing a contact sport while the United States endures a pandemic that has claimed over 180,000 lives.</p>

<p>Brandt asked Cousins for his level of concern about the pandemic on 1-10 scale, with 1 representing someone who thinks 'masks are stupid' and 10 being someone who won't leave their bedroom 'for the next 10 years.'</p>

<p>'I'm not gonna call anybody stupid, for the trouble it would get me in,' Cousins said. 'But I'm about a .000001.</p>

<p>'I want to respect what other people's concerns are,' he continued. 'For me personally, just talking no one else can get the virus, what is your concern if you could get it, I would say I'm gonna go about my daily life. If I get it, I'm gonna ride it out. I'm gonna let nature do its course. Survival-of-the-fittest kind of approach. And just say, if it knocks me out, it knocks me out. I'm going to be OK. You know, even if I die. If I die, I die. I kind of have peace about that.'</p>

<p>Minnesota has recorded 76,404 cases of coronavirus resulting in 1,872 deaths, according to The New York Times. However, the number of new cases has been decreasing from August 29, when over 1,000 were recorded, until Tuesday, when only 491 infections were discovered. </p>

<p>Cousins said he continues to wear a mask to be 'respectful to other people,' but that it 'really has nothing to do with m own personal thoughts.</p>

<p>When asked about the potential reaction to a teammate sneezing in the huddle would be, Cousins said there would be a 'dichotomy' between people 'who couldn't care less about the virus' and those who are 'consumed with fear.'</p>

<p>'What you don't know is who's where on the spectrum when you first go back.'</p>

<p>The NFL season will be played, at least initially, in mostly empty stadiums, depending on the guidelines from local health officials in each market. Coaches and staffers in the sideline will be required to wear masks and each team will have a drastically reduced traveling party.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the league and players' union announced that 10 players and staffers tested positive for coronavirus during the initial testing period between August 21 and August 29.</p>

<p>In total, 8,739 players and staff members were tested during that period.</p>
