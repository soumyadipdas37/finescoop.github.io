<p>The intricate swan-shaped pot attracted national attention after it was discovered with ‘mysterious brew’ inside a tomb in the city of Sanmenxia of China’s central province Henan earlier this year.</p>

<p>The intricate swan-shaped pot attracted national attention after it was discovered with ‘mysterious brew’ inside a tomb in the city of Sanmenxia of China’s central province Henan</p>

<p>It was revealed on Thursday by experts that the unknown liquid was alcohol dating to the early Western Han dynasty (206 BC-24 AD). The picture shows a researcher holding the wine</p>

<p>The medicinal wine was found as part of an excavation of an ancient tomb when the archaeologists were examining the site of a local redevelopment project in May, reported state media Xinhua.</p>

<p>A bronze pot with a curved neck in the shape of a swan was uncovered from the burial site. </p>

<p>The pottery had contained over three litres of unknown liquid with a yellowish-brown colour. It was also said to be the first pot of its kind to be unearthed in the region. </p>

<p>The ‘mysterious brew’ drew national interest as samples of the liquid sent to a laboratory in Beijing to determine exactly what it is, and hopefully whether or not it’s safe to drink.</p>

<p>The mystery was finally solved on Thursday as researchers confirmed it to be alcohol, reported Chinese media.</p>

<p>The alcohol was similar to the medicinal liquor recorded in an ancient medical book discovered in the Mawangdui Tombs of the Han Dynasty in Changsha, central China’s Hunan province. </p>

<p>The medicinal wine was used to stop bleeding and reduce inflammation, according to the Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology of Sanmenxia. </p>

<p>‘The test report of the liquid shows the pot could be a drinking vessel, and the liquor can be poured from a small hole on the top,’ Li Yongtao, a local archaeologist, told CCTV</p>

<p>The medicinal wine was found as part of an excavation of an ancient tomb when the archaeologists were examining the site of a local redevelopment project in May, reported state media Xinhua. A collection of the uncovered items from the tomb is pictured being displayed</p>

<p>‘The test report of the liquid shows the pot could be a drinking vessel, and the liquor can be poured from a small hole on the top,’ Li Yongtao, a local archaeologist, told state broadcaster CCTV. </p>

<p>He added that more tests are underway in a bid to unravel more information about the ancient wine - what substances it consisted and how it was produced, for example.</p>

<p>Experts also said that the liquor was able to be preserved for 2,000 years due to the unique design of the pot and its location.</p>

<p>Yan Fei, a director at the Sanmenxia institute, told CCTV: 'First of all, the burial location is about four metres (13 feet) deep underground. Current human activities barely disrupted the tomb.</p>

<p>'...the most important thing is the pot's special design of curved neck that prevented the liquid from evaporating and preserved it till now,' he said. </p>

<p>In addition to the swan pot, a bronze helmet, basin and swords made of jade and iron had also been uncovered from the tomb.</p>

<p>The wine was found in a tomb in the city of Sanmenxia of China’s central province Henan earlier this year when the archaeologists were examining the site of a redevelopment project</p>

<p>The owner of the tomb is believed to be a male warrior and about 1.8 metres (5ft9) tall, according to the experts.</p>

<p>'There were also bronze mirrors and bronze accessories unearthed and they were discovered ,' said Mr Li. </p>

<p>'It shows that the tomb owner was conscious about his appearance and he cared about the quality of life.'</p>

<p>The man's age and cause of death remain unknown due to the poor preservation of the human bones, reports say.</p>

<p>Last year, Chinese archaeologists said a fabled 'Elixir of immortality' mentioned throughout ancient Chinese texts was discovered in a bronze pot hidden inside in a 2,000-year-old burial tomb. </p>

<p>The container was unearthed in March 2019 in the tomb of the Western Han Dynasty (202 BC-8 AD) noble family and contains six pints (3.5 litres) of the concoction. </p>

<p>China's rich and powerful searched for a magical potion over thousands of years that would bring them external life. </p>

<p>The mythical quest for the non-existent cure was inevitably unsuccessful and instead yielded a drink which is thought to have spelled like alcohol. </p>
