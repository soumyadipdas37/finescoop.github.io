<p>Jourdan Kidd-Karam (pictured) was brought down by security guards after robbing a 91-year-old woman</p>

<p>The court heard that Kidd-Karam had taken at least nine Xanax tablets and drunk up to three beers early that day, leaving him with memory of the incident</p>

<p>The court heard the pensioner was walking to her car at about 6.15pm on February 3, when Kidd-Karam reached into her shopping trolley and snatched her purse.</p>

<p>Kidd-Karam then sprinted across the car park to make his getaway.</p>

<p>But a nearby security guard patrolling the area gave chase, eventually running down the thief and tackling him to the ground.</p>

<p>Another security member, along with a van driver, soon followed and the group made a citizen's arrest. </p>

<p>The court heard that Kidd-Karam had taken at least nine Xanax tablets and drunk up to three beers early that day, leaving him with memory of the incident.</p>

<p>'He'd lost money gambling and was in a position where he was under the influence of a drug,' prosecutor Joel Sleep told the court. </p>

<p>Kidd-Karam was sentence to 80 hours of community service and 12 months probation </p>

<p>Defence solicitor Christopher Hannay told Seven News Kidd-Karam's congnitive function has been greatly diminished due to his violent upbringing as a child.  </p>

<p>'He's totally dysfunctional,' Hannay told the court.</p>

<p>'There's been abuse, there's been drugs.</p>

<p>'He's had no father figure.'</p>

<p>Magistrate Grace Kahlert told Kidd-Karam: 'You should rightly be ashamed of your behaviour.'</p>

<p>He sentenced Kidd-Karam to 80 hours of community service and 12 months probation, labeling the crime an 'opportunistic' theft'.</p>
