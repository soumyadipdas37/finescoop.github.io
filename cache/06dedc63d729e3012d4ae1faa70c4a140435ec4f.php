<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scouting can be frustrating but also enjoyable and occasionally incredibly satisfying. Many times you will see a player, particularly a young one, who you feel has the ability to justify a recommendation.</p>

<p>What you don’t know initially is if his attitude, character and mentality are good enough.</p>

<p>All you can go on is the evidence before you, your experience and the views and information of your contacts in the game. But special talent stands out a mile and over the course of almost five years of writing in Sportsmail, I think I have managed to get a few right.</p>

<p>Here is a team (4-3-3) and three substitutes of young prospects I identified during the course of my travels up and down the country...</p>

<p>Our Secret Scout has unearthed a host of talents who made it to the very top of the game </p>

<p>Goalkeeper: Jordan Pickford</p>

<p>Spotted: February 2016 playing for Sunderland academy. Now: Everton and England.</p>

<p>What I wrote: ‘Athletic, confident… a shot stopper with quick reflexes…’</p>

<p>What I think now: Yes, he is always confident and he can be spectacular. But I still think he can get excitable at times during games. </p>

<p>Right-back: Ainsley Maitland-Niles</p>

<p>Spotted: At Ipswich aged 18, on loan from Arsenal. Now: Arsenal and England. </p>

<p>I wrote: ‘He reminds me of Ray Parlour, Arsenal’s former midfield grafter…’</p>

<p>Now: I wondered if he had enough subtlety in possession but he has stuck to his guns. He has had some problems but has developed into a fine utility player. The Ray Parlour comparison was in relation to his energy levels.</p>

<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles has risen to the England team after impressing for his club Arsenal </p>

<p>Centre-back: Adam Webster</p>

<p>Spotted: Another at Ipswich, this time in September 2016. Now: Brighton.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘He has ability, vision and skill. Makes a pass rather than lumping it forward. Reminds me of John Stones.’</p>

<p>Now: Had the tendency to make mistakes back then but over the years has proved his quality to reach the Premier League.</p>

<p>Centre-back: Chris Mepham</p>

<p>Spotted: Playing for Brentford in February 2018. Now: Wales and Bournemouth.</p>

<p>What I wrote: ‘All the necessary physical characteristics. Tall and an easy mover.’</p>

<p>Now: He developed under quality management by Dean Smith and made a rapid rise to impress Eddie Howe. He has had some injury setbacks. There is more improvement to come.</p>

<p>Chris Mepham emerged quickly under Eddie Howe at Bournemouth, impressing last season</p>

<p>Left-back: Ben Chilwell</p>

<p>Spotted: For Leicester age-group teams as a teenager in March 2016. Now: Chelsea and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘Nothing would deter me from recommending him. He will make a top-level career.’</p>

<p>Now: Captain of the youth team when I saw him, he was so comfortable going forward — and still is. An obvious future player.</p>

<p>Right midfield: James Maddison</p>

<p>Spotted: Playing in Norwich’s midfield in November 2017. Now: Leicester and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘He first caught my eye at Coventry and is flourishing as a 20-year-old support player. Confident, with a football brain.’</p>

<p>Now: I never forgot him after first seeing him at Coventry. Plays like he has eyes in the back of his head and you can’t teach vision like that.</p>

<p>Maddison's footballing brain was obvious to our Secret Scout from his early Coventry days</p>

<p>Centre midfield: Mason Mount</p>

<p>Spotted: On loan aged 18 at Vitesse Arnhem in August 2017. Now: Chelsea and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘He looks a future star. An accurate passer prepared to play the risk ball.’</p>

<p>Now: He has continued that development to become a confident player with outstanding intelligence.</p>

<p>Left-midfield: Harry Winks</p>

<p>Spotted: Tottenham Under 23s in October 2016. Now: Spurs and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘It’s very difficult to emerge from youth football to the Premier League but I predict Tottenham have one here to follow in the footsteps of Harry Kane.’</p>

<p>Now: Terrific attitude, he has the ability to set up attacks and change the direction of play.</p>

<p>Harry Winks has steadily become a vital players for Spurs after emerging from the academy</p>

<p>Right-forward: Adama Traore</p>

<p>Spotted: At Middlesbrough in March 2018. Now: Wolves.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘His obvious attribute is his speed but he must get his head up more often. He has not continued early form but his combination play is improving.’</p>

<p>Now: He still has that special pace and yes he has learned to get his head up now! Benefited from good coaching and he is still getting better.</p>

<p>Centre-forward: Oli McBurnie</p>

<p>Spotted: At Swansea in December 2017. Now: Sheffield United and Scotland.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘At 21, this strapping leader of the line looks like a throwback to when brave centre forwards showed no fear.’</p>

<p>Now: Has made the step up under good management by Chris Wilder in the Premier League. Shows there is still room for what I may call a traditional forward.</p>

<p>Oliver McBurnie was a crucial part of Sheffield United's incredible Premier League return </p>

<p>Left-forward: Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Spotted: December 2016 in Manchester City’s academy. Now: Borussia Dortmund and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘City have a fine, elusive youngster running the wide left attacking side in their academy teams. Sancho is only 16 but should have a big future.’</p>

<p>Now: His eye for goal and his electric speed are such a great combination. He was so well developed at City that Gareth Southgate’s England are seeing the benefits of that now.</p>

<p>Substitutes: </p>

<p>Jack Grealish</p>

<p>Spotted: At Aston Villa in November 2016. Now: Aston Villa and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘Scouts have been buzzing about him for years. Playing in a losing team has stunted him but he is brave, has footwork and a nice drop of the shoulder.’</p>

<p>Now: He was always a super-confident character. He still shows for the ball and is so happy in possession.</p>

<p>Jack Grealish is now an England international and his confidence has seen him rise sharply</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham</p>

<p>Spotted: In Chelsea’s youth system as a teenager in April 2016. Now: Chelsea and England.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘A prodigious scorer who needs to be pushed and tested against stronger opposition, maybe on loan.’</p>

<p>Now: Those loans at Bristol City and Aston Villa have helped his development for sure. But he may well find himself at a career crossroads now.</p>

<p>Jarrod Bowen</p>

<p>Spotted: September 2017 at Hull City. Now: West Ham.</p>

<p>I wrote: ‘Takes the ball well in his stride and can accelerate away, even if he has not yet got the strength to hold his speed over longer distances.’</p>

<p>Now: He has an eye for goal and is three years older and stronger. The step up hasn’t fazed him. A success story.</p>
