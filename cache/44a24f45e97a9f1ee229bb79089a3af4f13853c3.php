<p>The Manchester City striker is close friends with his Argentina team-mate, who shocked the world of football last week by informing Barcelona he wants to leave this summer.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old was dealt a blow by LaLiga on Sunday after he was told he cannot leave the Catalan giants on a free transfer, but reports remain rife of an impending move to Pep Guardiola's City.</p>

<p>Aguero is close friends with Argentina team-mate Messi who wants to leave Barcelona </p>

<p>That move would see Messi link up with Aguero at club level too, and fans were desperate to put the question to the four-time Premier League winner.</p>

<p>But after logging into Twitch for a live stream, Aguero refused to mention his international team-mate's name, while also deciding to mute the words 'Messi', 'Leo' and 'GOAT' from the live video.</p>

<p>Aguero has more than two million followers on Twitch after setting up his own channel.</p>

<p>But Aguero refused to discuss or mention his international team-mate's name while gaming</p>

<p>Messi has been tipped for a reunion with former boss Pep Guardiola at Manchester City</p>

<p>But this time when he logged in he just wanted to play the video game Fall Guys rather than discuss the story that has rocked the football world.</p>

<p>It is not the first time that Messi's name has been involved in one of Aguero's Twitch sessions.</p>

<p>But the 33-year-old received a blow when he was informed that he could not leave on a free</p>

<p>Messi knew this and messaged Aguero to 'stop messing around' in an amazing telling off, with the striker reading the text out live on air.</p>

<p>The Barcelona star's transfer away from the club is no laughing matter however, with the 33-year-old believing a clause in his contract states he can leave on a free transfer at the end of each season should he want to, one which Barcelona claim expired on June 10.</p>

<p>And LaLiga have sided with Barcelona's version of events, which boosts the Catalans chances of keeping hold of their talisman this summer.</p>

<p>LaLiga have sided with Barcelona, boosting their chances of keeping hold of their talisman</p>

<p>It means City will need to pay the £630million release clause to sign the Argentinian star this summer, or strike a transfer agreement with Barcelona in the market.</p>

<p>This could impact the deal as Messi's overall transfer package will now be larger, given his large wages and image rights payments. </p>

<p>Messi is understood to earn £63million-a-year which includes basic salary and image rights fees. However, performance-related bonuses and other sponsorship agreements could take that number to around £94million-a-year.</p>
