<p>Last season: Teddi starred alongside Garcelle Beauvais, Denise Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi and Dorit Kemsley in season 10</p>

<p>Former housewife Lisa Vanderpump took to her podcast All Things Vanderpump and addressed Teddi's departure from the show. </p>

<p>When asked why she thought Teddi had been fired by Bravo execs, Lisa said: 'I don't know, people said because she was boring.</p>

<p>'I certainly didn't have a good experience with her, so boring would be one of the nicer things that I could say.' </p>

<p>Lisa, for her part, left the show in season nine amid a fall out with former friends Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley. </p>
