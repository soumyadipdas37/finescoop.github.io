<p>One official even feared Mrs May would either 'scream or start crying' over her frustration at Mr Trump's stubbornness during a call about the US government's response to the Salisbury poisonings.</p>

<p>A series of meetings - details of the notes of which were leaked and verified by various officials - outline the strain put on the so-called US-UK 'special relationship' after the former-PM became the first foreign leader Mr Trump hosted in his White House.</p>

<p>Notes taken during this first meeting in January 2017 revealed that Mr Trump asked Mrs May: 'Why isn't Boris Johnson the prime minister? Didn't he want the job?'</p>

<p>Mrs May - who was also pressed for her stance on abortion - is said to have explained to the newly-inaugurated president that Mr Johnson himself withdrew, The Sunday Telegraph reports. </p>

<p>Another conversation between the pair followed the Salisbury novichok poisoning in March 2018.</p>

<p>Former GRU spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were the targets of a nerve-agent attack - allegedly orchestrated by two Russian assassins.</p>

<p>The US announced the expulsion of 60 Russians - including 12 intelligence officers from Russia's mission to UN headquarters in New York - later that month, following a conversation with Mrs May.</p>

<p>The then-Prime Minister urged Mr Trump to head the global action against Russia - but Mr Trump pushed back, instead stating the EU should take action.</p>

<p>The call was said to be so frustrating that one US listener feared Mrs May would break down in tears.</p>

<p>But officials both in the UK and the US have denied these suggestions </p>

<p>Notes taken during this first meeting in January 2017 (their first meeting, pictured) revealed that Mr Trump asked Mrs May: 'Why isn't Boris Johnson the prime minister? Didn't he want the job?'</p>

<p>Boris Johnson (pictured with Trump in 2019), on the other hand, did things differently. He formed relationships with those close to Mr Trump - including his son-in-law Jared Kushner</p>

<p>Mr Trump also had a 'bullying' and 'mansplaining' tone during certain conversations between the pair, the paper reports, and Mrs May was sometimes forced to pull the conversation back to the relevant topic after Mr Trump would go off on tangents.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson, on the other hand, did things differently.</p>

<p>He formed relationships with those close to Mr Trump - including his son-in-law Jared Kushner. </p>

<p>Just this week, Mr Johnson 'dropped in' on a meeting between White House adviser Mr Kushner and UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson made a 'short drop-in' during talks at the Foreign Office between Mr Raab and Mr Kushner about the situation in the Middle East.</p>

<p>It was 'specifically a discussion about the Middle East peace process', the Prime Minister's spokesman told reporters during a briefing.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump's son-in-law arrived in London having this week travelled on a high-level Israeli delegation to the United Arab Emirates on the first direct commercial passenger flight between the two countries. </p>
