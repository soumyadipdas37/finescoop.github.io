<p>Bumping along nicely! Camilla Thurlow is certainly getting excited about the arrival of her child with her co-star Jamie Jewitt as she took to Instagram on Thursday</p>

<p>Camilla was radiant in the picture as she smiled at the camera and showed the rising hem on her top around her growing stomach.</p>

<p>Revealing she's in her 35th week, she penned a caption reading: 'The tops are getting shorter, the leggings are getting higher, the ankles are getting bigger... and don't even get me started on the size of the underwear #35weeks'.</p>

<p>Clearly as excited as his girlfriend, Jamie wrote: 'So close!!!' </p>

<p>Camilla's post comes after she admitted there have been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but that she's 'very happy' while talking to Andi Peters on Lorraine.</p>

<p>Ha! Revealing she's in her 35th week, she penned a caption reading: 'The tops are getting shorter, the leggings are getting higher, the ankles are getting bigger... and don't even get me started on the size of the underwear #35weeks', while Jamie also commented</p>

<p>New: Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World - a memoir about finding courage at work and in her personal life. Pictured with Andi Peters</p>

<p>The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.</p>

<p>She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust. </p>

<p>'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. </p>

<p>Something for herself: Camilla was approached to go on Love Island at a time when she said she was 'struggling' after returning  from Afghanistan </p>

<p>'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.</p>

<p>'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'</p>

<p>Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World </p>

<p>The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.</p>

<p>Exciting time: Camilla has been sharing a steady stream of baby bump pictures on social media and has said she is 'very very happy'</p>
