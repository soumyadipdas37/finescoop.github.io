<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chrissy Teigen has given her followers an update on her pregnancy, revealing she was hospitalised on Sunday evening after a month of bleeding.</p>

<p>The model, who is expecting her third child, a baby boy, with husband John Legend, had already been on strict bed rest this month but as she explained in a series of Instagram Stories on Sunday, her bleeding had worsened.</p>

<p>Posting from her bed at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Chrissy begged her followers not to try and diagnose her over Twitter as she explained more about her condition.     </p>

<p>Hospital: Chrissy Teigen has given her followers an update on her pregnancy, revealing she was hospitalised on Sunday evening after bleeding for the past month</p>

<p>'We all know I've been on bed rest for a few weeks and that's like super serious bed rest. I get up to pee and take baths twice a week, no showering, just as little as possible,' Chrissy began.</p>

<p>'But I was always, always bleeding. I'm about halfway through pregnancy and the blood has been going on for about a month, maybe a little bit less than a month. We're talking about more than your period girls, it's definitely not spotting. A lot of people spot but it's usually fine. Mine was a lot.' </p>

<p>'Everytime I go to the bathroom it would be blood, and honestly just laying there there would be blood.'</p>

<p>Chrissy went on to explain that on Sunday her bleeding worsened comparing it to 'like if you were to turna faucet onto low and leave it there...It was at the point today where it was never stopping, the bleeding.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>High risk pregnancy: The model had already been on strict bed rest this month but as she explained in a series of Instagram Stories on Sunday, her bleeding had worsened</p>

<p>She added that she was feeling great, telling her fans 'it's so weird because I feel really good. I'm usually at my happiest pregnant, mood wise. That's why it's so hard for me to come to terms with.'  </p>

<p>Chrissy also beamed as she revealed her baby was doing well, explaining: 'In the simplest of terms we can say my placenta is really, really weak, So I feel really good and the baby is so healthy, growing stronger than Luna or Miles.'</p>

<p>'He moves so much, so much earlier than they ever did. I'm so excited for him, he's the strongest little dude. He;'s the strongest coolest dude in the sh***iest house.'</p>

<p>'So his house is like falling apart. It didn't have a good foundation to begin with, he didn't have the strongest chance at the very, very beginning so all we're doing now is trying to make sure he has a lot of fluid around him and I'm resting as much as possible.'</p>

<p>By her side: Chrissy revealed her husband John Legend was with her. The couple are expecting their third child, a baby boy</p>

<p>Scary: 'Everytime I go to the bathroom it would be blood, and honestly just laying there there would be blood,' she told her followers, adding that her baby though is 'the strongest, coolest little dude'</p>

<p>'It's just hard because there's not much we can do. I'm at that weird inbetween time where it's dangerous to try anything. If me and baby boy can make it through the next few weeks then we can go from there and get through the danger zone.'</p>

<p>'It is scary,' Chrissy admitted, 'but scary in the way that there is really nothing to do. I take my progesteroneand my iron and we're trying everything we can.'</p>

<p>She then pleaded with her fans and medical professionals online to let her doctors do the work, cautioning: 'If you are a doctor I can not express enough how badly I would like you to stop your guessing games or even diagnosing me via twitter. I have very good doctors who know the entire story. I share a lot but not absolutely everything.' </p>

<p>Chrissy was later joined by John in her hospital room, as she filmed her husband and joked he was trying to check out the mini bar.  </p>

<p>Earlier on Sunday, the model said she was 'so bored' while stuck at home, and planning a bed rest photo shoot 'in full glam.' She later admitted she was grateful to have put on makeup before heading to hospital.</p>

<p>Change of plans: Chrissy Teigen, 34, joked Sunday afternoon that she was 'so bored' while on bed rest at home, but she surprised her 31.3 million Instagram followers when her next post was from a hospital bed</p>

<p>Chrissy originally filmed herself for her Instagram Stories in closeup from her bed, with nothing on but a white towel.</p>

<p>'I'm having a bored time — a bed time boredom photoshoot today. Just in bed,' she said sleepily.</p>

<p>'Full glam. Just so bored,' she joked, while showing off her makeup-free face and clear skin. </p>

<p>'So bored': 'I'm having a bored time — a bed time boredom photoshoot today. Just in bed,' she said sleepily in her original post from home</p>

<p>Looking good: 'Full glam. Just so bored,' she joked, while showing off her makeup-free face and clear skin</p>

<p>'Scratch that': Chrissy wasn't bored anymore after she ended up in the maternity ward at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA, though she didn't say why she went there</p>

<p>Just hours later though she took a photo from her hospital bed, with a white board on the wall revealing she was in the Maternity Fetal Care Unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</p>

<p>A medical professional was administering to her and wearing a blue down jacket with colorful stripes on the sleeves.</p>

<p>'Scratch that,' Chrissy wrote, presumably referring to her statement about being bored.</p>

<p>Her visit to the maternity ward followed her announcement on Twitter on Thursday that she was ceasing all of her work temporarily after being diagnosed with a high-risk pregnancy.</p>

<p>'Today I had to postpone the cookbook indefinitely and sent <?php echo e('@'); ?>AdeenaSussman alllll the way back to Tel Aviv and same with shutting down filming Chrissy's Court. Baby cannot do it. I am devastated,' she tweeted. </p>

<p>Taking it easy: Her visit to the maternity ward followed her announcement on Twitter on Thursday that she was ceasing all of her work temporarily after being diagnosed with a high-risk pregnancy</p>

<p>Whoops! Chrissy took the hospital room photo down after people began calling en masse because she posted the room's phone number</p>

<p>The Chrissy's Court star took down the original hospital room photo.</p>

<p>'Lol I accidentally posted the phone number to my hospital room on Instagram so I have to move, I appreciate the phone calls though you little sweetie pies,' she tweeted. </p>

<p>Chrissy also spent Saturday in bed, when she documented her struggle to find a good Philly Cheesesteak in Los Angeles while using a dog face filter.</p>

<p>Though the one she eventually got delivered didn't look that appetizing, she was happy to report that it still tasted good. </p>

<p>On a quest: On Saturday, she used a dog face filter while searching for a good Philly cheesesteak in LA</p>

<p>Staying healthy: On Friday, Chrissy posted a video to her Insta Stories, giving a glimpse of a compression device wrapped around her leg that prevents blood clots</p>

<p>Yikes: She shared a hilarious screenshot from the same day after she shared a photo of what she thought was a blood clot that she passed to the wrong group chat</p>

<p>Chrissy revealed on Friday she's been spending considerable time in bed in recent weeks.</p>

<p>She posted a photo to her Insta Stories of the compression pads she has had to wear on her legs to help stop blood clots from forming, as extended bed rest can cause them.</p>

<p>In a hilarious admission, she revealed that she shared a photo of what she assumed was a blood clot that she had passed to one of her group chats — except that it was the wrong group chat.</p>

<p>A screenshot from the conversation shows her husband John Legend, 41, simply responding, 'welp,' before informing her that it was the wrong chat.</p>

<p>Chrissy previously said that her pregnancies with Luna, four, and Miles, two, were complicated after her placenta failed to nourish them properly, requiring her to be induced early both times.</p>

<p>Understated: A screenshot from the conversation shows her husband John Legend, 41, simply responding, 'welp,' before informing her that it was the wrong chat </p>

<p>Cool it: Later on Sunday night, Chrissy took to Twitter to urge doctors and some of her overzealous fans to stop trying to diagnose her on social media or to give her unsolicited medical advice</p>

<p>Phew: She also revealed that the food at the hospital, which included some kind of meat with gravy, mashed and roasted potatoes and mixed vegetables, wasn't bad at all</p>
