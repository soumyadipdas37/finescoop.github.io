<p>'Number four!' Alex replied. </p>

<p>'Yes indeed,' Keanu said. 'So we are out here trying to make some magic.'</p>

<p>Keanu agreed, saying: 'No it didn't, it looked a little dire for Neo.'</p>

<p>The actor then discussed the film's script, saying: 'We have a wonderful director, Lana Wachowski, and she has written a beautiful script that is a love story, it's inspiring.</p>

<p>'It's another version, a call to wake up and it has some great action.' Leaning in close to the camera, he added: 'All will be revealed.'</p>

<p>The actor said there were 'thoughtful, effective protocols in place' on set in a video chat interview with the Associated Press.</p>

<p>He said: 'There’s some really thoughtful, effective protocols in place, and the rhythm of filmmaking has not been really impacted or interrupted, in the sense of filming.</p>

<p>'That’s because of the hard work and organization, and again the thoughtfulness that has gone into the protocols.' </p>

<p>Interview: Keanu spoke to Alex Jones and Ronan Keating on Tuesday's episode of The One Show</p>

<p>Filming originally began in San Francisco, where some locals were angered by property destruction caused in the midst of action scenes.</p>

<p>The production then moved to Berlin in February but was quickly shut down due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Back in June, Keanu told Empire Magazine that it was the quality of the writing that drew him to this installment of The Matrix, which hasn't gotten a finalised title yet. '</p>

<p>'Lana Wachowski wrote a beautiful script and a wonderful story that resonated with me,' he said. 'That’s the only reason to do it.'</p>

<p>The new working relationship seemed to still have some of the old magic, even though Lana's sister Lilly Wachowski sat out this installment.</p>

<p>Inspirational: Discussing the film's script, he said: 'We have a wonderful director, Lana Wachowski, and she has written a beautiful script that is a love story, it's inspiring' </p>

<p>'To work with her again is just amazing. It’s been really special, and the story has, I think, some meaningful things to say, and that we can take some nourishment from.'</p>

<p>The Matrix was originally envisioned as a science fiction–action film starring Will Smith in the Neo role, though he turned it down, and Val Kilmer as Morpheus, who was eventually played by Laurence Fishburne.</p>

<p>The ground-breaking film went on to be one of the most successful films of 1999 and earned four Academy Awards, along with copious praise from critics.</p>
