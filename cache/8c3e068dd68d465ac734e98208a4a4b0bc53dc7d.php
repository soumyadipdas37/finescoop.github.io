<p>'The last few months have been tough for families and caused massive disruption to most of our lives. We are spending more time than ever together in our homes, and it's fair to say some areas of our lives have been a little neglected,' Dr Sharp said.</p>

<p>'From the lighting of a room to ornaments and furniture, there are numerous ways the space we live in affects our happiness, which in turn leads toward better health and improved wellbeing, ultimately resulting in emotional benefits for the whole family,' he said.</p>
