<p>The woman, 30, claims she is a victim of 'stealthing' after telling police she had spent part of the night at the home of the ambassador, 44, she had met through a dating site.   </p>

<p>A source close to the inquiry said: 'They had met up several times without any sexual relations. That evening, they had consensual sex.'</p>

<p>Confirming the report in French magazine Le Point, the source added: 'She asked him to use a condom but realised during the act that the man was not wearing one.'</p>

<p>The woman filed her complaint three days later.</p>

<p>The source did not identify him by name, while Le Point said only that he is based in the Middle East.</p>

<p>French law defines rape as 'any sexual penetration... committed against another through violence, force, threat or surprise'.</p>

<p>But no clear jurisprudence exists for 'stealthing', which is when a man removes a condom while having sex with a partner who requested he wear one.</p>

<p>The action can potentially expose him or her to HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>A woman also risks being impregnated.</p>

<p>In January 2017, a court in Lausanne, Switzerland, handed a Frenchman a suspended 12-month prison sentence after convicting him of 'rape' for removing his condom without telling his partner.</p>

<p>A few months later, the sentence was upheld on appeal, but the court lowered the charge to 'a sexual act committed against a person unable to discern or resist it'.</p>

<p>A scene depicting stealthing was shown recently in Michaela Coel's hit BBC sitcom I May Destroy You, in which the man is labelled a rapist.</p>
