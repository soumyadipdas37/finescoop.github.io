<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The massive demand for pets during the coronavirus lockdown has pushed the prices of some popular dog breeds to staggering levels, with 'groodles' now fetching as much as $15,000 each.</p>

<p>So intense has the value of dogs become that breeders are introducing extra security measures to prevent theft, and adoption centres have stopped advertising their animals online to deter profit-seeking middle men from getting them.</p>

<p>Amanda Wilkinson, from Adelaide Hills Groodles, has been breeding dogs on-and-off for the past two decades and concentrating on groodles - a Golden Retriever and poodle cross - for the past couple of years.</p>

<p>Mrs Wilkinson told Daily Mail Australia she received an average of eight inquires a week about her dogs before COVID-19 - and now gets ten times that many.</p>

<p>'COVID-19 has seen people at home with not a lot to do and have assumed now a good time to bring a puppy into their lives,' she said.</p>

<p>However she claimed it could possibly be the worst time as dogs become used to constant interaction and taking it away can cause anxiety, and those making the decision to get a dog now may not entirely understand the breed. </p>

<p>Mrs Wilkinson said she and her husband Sam always planned on giving their dog Matilda a rest from breeding during the year.</p>

<p>With 109 people on the waiting list for a litter in May, she had become concerned that there were potentially an onset of irresponsible owners or people who did not understand the breed.</p>

<p>Consequently, Mrs Wilkinson cut off her waiting list and is no longer accepting applicants. </p>

<p>Popular dog breeds such as groodles (pictured) are being sold for up to $15,000 amid a massive demand for pets during the COVID-19 pandemic</p>

<p>She stressed the people who had already applied had a genuine interest in owning a groodle. </p>

<p>'Prices from some breeders have gone to the extreme and in all honesty, it is somewhat embarrassing,' she said.</p>

<p>'Some of us breeders are still charging pre-COVID prices of $3,500 - $4,500 where as the "standard’ price seems to be $7,000 up to $15,000.'</p>

<p>Mrs Wilkinson said the couple have never advertised their pets online due to their stellar reputation of treating their 'breeding dogs' as their pets first and foremost.</p>

<p>She said she and her husband Sam have had growing security concerns due to the popularity of the breed.  </p>

<p>Shirley Moore (pictured), from Bribie Island, Queensland, 16-year-old mini fox terrier Lily died last month - and ever since she has struggled to find a new companion</p>

<p>'There is a lot of greed in the world and with groodles now being a highly sought after dog, their prices being something people are paying, there is more concern around theft than ever before,' Mrs Wilkinson said.</p>

<p>'We take a huge risk welcoming potential families in our home to view our puppies and meet Murphy and Matilda so it was an unfortunate thing we had to do installing cameras inside and out. </p>

<p>'As our puppies are born and raised within our home, we feel secure in their safety but one can never be too careful.'</p>

<p>While breeders were in a position to benefit from surging demand, it was a different story for would-be owners, as dogs - particularly of popular breeds - are becoming scarce. </p>

<p>Shirley Moore, from Bribie Island, Queensland, had struggled to find a new companion since her 16-year-old mini fox terrier Lily died last month.</p>

<p>Due to the lockdowns, waiting lists were extremely long for shelters in areas such as Bribie Island, Dakabin, Morayfield and Caboolture.</p>

<p>Then Australian National K9 Rescue matched the 85-year-old woman with a four-year-old Tenterfield terrier named Tia (pictured)</p>

<p>Help was at hand for Ms Moore, as Australian National K9 Rescue matched the 85-year-old woman with a four-year-old Tenterfield terrier named Tia.  </p>

<p>Leanne, from the Australian National K9 Rescue, helped paired Ms Moore with her new pooch.</p>

<p>She revealed the organisation has been hesitant to advertise dogs online due to the pandemic,</p>

<p>She said the pandemic has created a high demand for companion dogs - but people are using that as a chance to buy adopted dogs and onselling them to make a profit.</p>

<p>'There are a lot of people buying up dogs and puppies from rescue organisations and breeders and then on-selling them,' she told the ABC. </p>

<p>'They're not even going to the homes that they are supposed to have gone to.</p>

<p>'We've been using word-of-mouth to find the right homes for dogs, making sure that they end up in those home.'</p>
