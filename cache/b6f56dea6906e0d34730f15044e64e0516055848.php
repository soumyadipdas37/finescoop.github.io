<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Saturday Night Live has found its new Joe Biden, after the Democratic presidential candidate was portrayed by three different people throughout the 45th season.</p>

<p>NBC's long-running sketch comedy tapped Jim Carrey to play the former U.S. Vice President, who is seeking to bring 'energy and strength' to his depiction. </p>

<p>'Jim Carrey is going to do Biden,' Saturday Night Live's Lorne Michaels revealed in an interview with Vulture of the casting, 48 days ahead of the election on November 3.</p>

<p>Saturday Night Live has chosen Jim Carrey to portray Joe Biden, after the Democratic presidential candidate was played by three different people throughout SNL’s 45th season</p>

<p>The Emmy Award-winning producer, 75, noted that the 58-year-old comedian first expressed interest in the role and joked 'hopefully' his performance would be 'funny.'   </p>

<p>'There was some interest on his part. And then we responded, obviously, positively. But it came down to discussions about what the take was,' he added. </p>

<p>Michaels also confirmed that Alec Baldwin will return as President Donald Trump, Maya Rudolph will play Kamala Harris and cast member Beck Bennett will portray Vice President Mike Pence. </p>

<p>Carrey is replacing Woody Harrelson, who played Biden last season, and Jason Sudeikis, who owned the role of the politician throughout the Obama administration. </p>

<p>The political recast disappointed some fans, who flocked to Twitter to express their opinions. </p>

<p>'I’m so angry about this, I was sure they’d bring Sudeikis back,' noted Barack Obama's former chief speechwriter, Jon Favreau. </p>

<p>Making adjustments: Saturday Night Live will not have a studio audience present when cameras roll on its 46th season next month</p>

<p>The announcement comes after it was revealed earlier this week, SNL would not have a studio audience present when cameras roll on its 46th season next month. </p>

<p>Production insiders told TMZ that the show will indefinitely go without a studio audience present amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Insiders told the outlet that officials from the NBC comedy stalwart are looking at potential filming locations around New York City and New Jersey that can provide more space for social distancing precautions than the show's home base of Studio 8H at Rockefeller Center. </p>

<p>The show is also going to incorporate the remote site Zoom for celebrity appearances, as it did earlier this year when Tom Hanks, Larry David and Brad Pitt appeared on it.</p>

<p>Tis the season: The upcoming presidential election is expected to be a regular topic </p>

<p>A scaled down production crew will be on hand to work on the series, sources told the outlet. </p>

<p>The famed variety series initially halted production at Studio 8H - like nearly all Hollywood productions - amid the shutdown six months ago, and has since broadcast with Zoom for celebrity guests.</p>

<p>The current cast of the series, which was last on the air May 9, includes Beck Bennett, Aidy Bryant, Michael Che, Pete Davidson, Mikey Day, Heidi Gardner, Colin Jost, Kate McKinnon, Alex Moffat, Kyle Mooney, Chris Redd, Cecily Strong, Kenan Thompson and Melissa Villaseñor.</p>

<p>Additionally, three more cast members have been added: Lauren Holt, Punkie Johnson and Andrew Dismukes. </p>

<p>Saturday Night Live is set to come back on October 3. </p>

<p>Maya Rudolph, who left the show full-time in 2007, is expected to appear more playing vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris. She was snapped in NYC last year </p>
