<p>Carly has been busy documenting her pregnancy experience. She told Nine Now that she already knew she was pregnant before taking the test.    </p>

<p> Mother's instinct kicking in? Carly revealed how she already knew she was pregnant before taking a test last month</p>

<p>'I knew that I was pregnant before I even missed my period and took a pregnancy test, it was really weird,' she said in August. </p>

<p>She claimed she had noticed her body was subtly changing, and also had a hunch about the gender of her child.</p>

<p>But Carly admitted that her intuition about the baby's sex was actually wrong.</p>

<p>She explained that her doctor accidentally revealed her child's gender during a routine scan, and it was the opposite of what she and Neil were expecting.    </p>

<p>Wasn't expecting that! Carly also revealed she had experienced bizarre symptoms during the early months of her pregnancy - namely constipation while speaking to Nine Now previously</p>

<p>'I was just in pure shock. Not because of disappointment, but just because of surprise,' she said. </p>

<p>She also revealed she had experienced bizarre symptoms during the early months of her pregnancy - namely constipation.   </p>

<p>'I wasn't expecting being constipated for the first three months. Apparently it is quite common, but it's one of those things that maybe the pregnant women aren't talking about,' she said. </p>

<p>Carly first announced her pregnancy in June. </p>

<p>Fans will remember Carly from the 2018 season of Married At First Sight. </p>

<p>She was partnered with ice cream entrepreneur Justin Fischer and later dated another groom, Troy Delmege, for several months. </p>

<p>Baby on board! Carly first announced her pregnancy in June. She shared a post to Instagram of herself and boyfriend Neil Goldsmith holding an ultrasound scan, and wrote: 'In what's been a crazy 2020, we see a little baby light at the end of the tunnel. We're over the moon'</p>
