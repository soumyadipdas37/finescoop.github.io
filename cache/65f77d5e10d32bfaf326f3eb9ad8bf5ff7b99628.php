<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fraudsters have been targeting Australians with a new tax office scam involving fake phone messages.</p>

<p>The elaborate scam is delivered via phone messages and SMS and urges people to hand over their credit card details - threatening innocent victims with arrest if they don't comply. </p>

<p>'Attention: this call is from the legal department of Services Australia,' the message says.</p>

<p>Communications Minister Paul Fletcher confirmed the rort is real and the technology used to dupe taxpayers is becoming increasingly sophisticated</p>

<p>'Your Tax File Identification Number has been suspended and we have filed a case under your name. </p>

<p>'So, before this matter goes to Federal Court and you could get arrested kindly press 1. I repeat press 1 to know about your legal case.'  </p>

<p>Communications Minister Paul Fletcher confirmed the rort is real and the technology used to dupe taxpayers is becoming increasingly sophisticated. </p>

<p>'A lot of scammers have been using so-called spoofing or overstamping of the number from which the call appears to originate,' he said, according to news.com.au.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from The Australian Tax Office said the body is concerned about the increasing number of people paying fake tax debt scammers</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Send you an email or text message asking you to send us your information by email or text message.</p></li>
<li><p>Send you an email or text message with a link to log into online services.</p></li>
<li><p>Send a pre-recorded message saying the police are coming to arrest you or demanding urgent payment of money.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask for payment by bank transfers to:</p></li>
</ul>

<p>A bank that is not the Reserve Bank of Australia  </p>

<p>Ooverseas wire transfers;</p>

<p>iTunes or Google Play cards; </p>

<p>Cardless cash transfers;</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. </p>

<p>'So Australians will get a phone call. It will look like it’s coming from a well recognised number that’s used by the Australian Tax Office or another well known organisation that advertises inbound numbers.'</p>

<p>He explained the cons are large-scale operations and detectives use complex software to find out where the calls come from.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from The Australian Tax Office said the body is concerned about the increasing number of people paying fake tax debt scammers.</p>

<p>'Scammers pretending to be from the ATO are contacting members of the community, telling them that they have a tax debt and that if they don't pay it straight away they will be arrested,' they said.</p>

<p>'These scammers will often request payment through unusual methods, such as cryptocurrency, pre-paid credit cards or gift cards, and will try to keep people on the line until they have paid.'</p>

<p>They urged anyone who received a phone call, text message or voicemail demanding money not to send a payment or provide personal information.  </p>

<p>'We will never threaten you with immediate arrest or demand payment through unusual means.'</p>

<p>Australians were scammed out of more than $11million in May this year thanks to a plague of fake money-making schemes. </p>

<p>Online phishing scams received the most reports in May, with households losing $185,000 combined, up 190 per cent from April.  </p>
