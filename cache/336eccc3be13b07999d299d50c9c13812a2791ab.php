<p>There has been a damning increase in online child sex abuse particularly during lockdown as kids remain inside on their phones.</p>

<p>The Australian Federal Police (AFP) have already arrested 161 disgusting predators and saved 134 children from abuse this year alone.</p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Daisie Beckensall said grooming is popular on social media apps like TikTok and Facebook, including gaming sites.</p>

<p>She explained that before the grooming process, the stranger pretends to be the child's friend before threatening to blackmail them. </p>

<p>'We see a lot of friend requests from online predators looking for children to follow, and the children will usually follow them back,' she told The Herald Sun.  </p>

<p>'They start chatting online – they build up a rapport with the child, it starts off as an innocent and friendly chat, then they ask, ''Send me a photo of yourself''.'</p>

<p>As the paedophiles pretend to be of similar age to the children they're grooming, they also first ask for innocent photos.</p>

<p>Soon after, they become more demanding asking for sexualised images and threatening to tell the children's parents if they stop sending photos. </p>

<p>'Once the predators have the photos, they use them to manipulate and put fear into kids.'</p>

<p>Detective Beckensall also said another worrying trend was children posting naked photos and videos of themselves because they think it is 'normal' after seeing it online.</p>

<p>With some students still studying at home, they might not be privy to the 'scrutiny' as they would if at school. </p>

<p>She said it is important that parents tell their children to come forward if they are being bullied.</p>

<p>If someone is contacting your child and this contact is unwanted or makes them feel uncomfortable, here are some things you can do to help.</p>
