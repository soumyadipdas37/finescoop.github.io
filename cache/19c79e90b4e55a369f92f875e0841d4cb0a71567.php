<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale's departure from Real Madrid is likely to be frustrated by the club's reluctance to pay off the remaining two years of his salary. </p>

<p>Bale's €17million (£15.1m) salary over his remaining two years would mean Madrid would have to negotiate a possible €34m (£30.2m) payoff which they are not in a position to do. </p>

<p>Marca suggested a meeting between Bale's representatives Stellar Group has already been set up but Sportsmail understands there is still no imminent meeting planned.  </p>

<p>The coming together will not be instigated by Bale whose agent Jonathan Barnett has repeated the player's intention to honour the two years remaining in his contract. </p>

<p>According to Marca, Real Madrid will seek clarification from Bale over his commitment to the club. </p>

<p>The player opted not to travel to the Champions League last-16 second leg against Manchester City.  </p>

<p>Bale has seen game time limited under boss Zidane and has fallen out of favour in Madrid</p>

<p>Madrid's urgency to get rid of Bale has diminished somewhat with the departure of James Rodríguez to Everton. </p>

<p>Bale was given just 100 minutes of action in the club's final 11 games as they held on to win their first LaLiga title since 2017. </p>

<p>He was on the verge of a move to the Chinese Super League with Jiangsu Suning ahead of last season, only for the deal to collapse late on after Florentino Perez stepped in. </p>

<p>Bale is now on international duty with Wales and national team boss Ryan Giggs said he would speak to the winger about his situation in Spain given his peripheral role under Zinedine Zidane.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'I haven't spoken to Zidane,' Giggs revealed. 'My French and Spanish isn't too good. That's my way out of that one.</p>

<p>'I know Zidane's English isn't very good from experience. I'm just monitoring the situation. When Gareth gets on camp I will speak to him like I always do.</p>

<p>'I've always said to him if he wants to speak then I'll listen and be more than happy to help him. He's experienced and professional enough to look after himself. But I'm there if he ever needs to speak.' </p>
