<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian mother has used up leftover bolognese by serving it in loaded potato skins with Mexican-style taco ingredients, and fellow home cooks are inspired.</p>

<p>The woman, who lives in Newcastle, New South Wales, shared a picture of the delicious dinnertime recipe in a budget-friendly meal ideas group on Facebook, earning plenty of compliments.</p>

<p>'Had leftover spaghetti bolognese from last night so we're having loaded potato skins tonight. Full bellies and smiles all around,' she captioned the snap.</p>

<p>In the photo fellow group members could see the crispy potatoes steaming from the oven and a miscellaneous plate of toppings, including the beef bolognese with tomato sauce.</p>

<p>She had also included bacon bits, tortilla chips, guacamole, spring onions, corn and sour cream so her family could eat it like a plate of nachos.</p>

<p>The inventive idea was given a thumbs up by fellow parents who said they were going to 'copy it' for one of this week's meals.</p>

<p>'This looks so yummy. What a brilliant idea!' Said one woman.</p>

<p>'Great idea, I haven't made these for ages,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'You've sorted me out for tonight's dinner. Good stuff'.</p>

<p>One replier did ask what the amateur cook does with the potato that is leftover when you cut around the skins.</p>

<p>To that question the original poster replied to say that she mashed it up to serve in a shepherd's pie for the following night's meals - so there is no wastage.</p>

<p>Many of the ingredients she worked with are commonly found inside the average household's fridge so it's an extremely inexpensive option for a family dinner.</p>
