<p>The buxom Brazilian, who shot to fame on the hit TLC show, has reportedly been given the axe by the network due to her current dabblings in the adult cam world. </p>

<p>On Saturday, Larissa, 33, took to Instagram to share the news in what she called her 'final statement.'</p>

<p>Final statement: 90 Day Fiance star Larissa Lima, 33, took to Instagram to share the news that TLC had dropped her from the hit reality tv show. Both parties seemed to cite her racy video work for CamSoda as the catalyst, with the news coming to Larissa the day before she was detained by ICE</p>

<p>The news comes at a rocky time as Larissa, who has faced legal trouble in the past, was detained by ICE last week ahead of the announcement.</p>

<p>Posting a dolled up close-up of herself, Larissa wrote, 'Dear Friends and Followers, I want to make a statement for you, I am no longer a cast member of the show '90 Day Fiance' she writes.</p>

<p> She continued 'Because of my show with CamSoda, I was released from my contract with TLC by phone the day before ICE arrested me.' </p>

<p>CamSoda: Lima who shot to fame on the TLC show has now started dabbling in more explicit content as she has been 'camgirling' for CamSoda and also utilizing OnlyFans</p>

<p> The surgically enhanced brunette went on to say that she would continue producing content for OnlyFans, Instagram and Youtube, before thanking her followers for their 'understanding, love and attention.'</p>

<p>Larissa's adult ventures only came to light after she made headlines for spending upwards of $72K on plastic surgery to look like Kylie Jenner. </p>

<p>As documented on the TLC spinoff 'Happily Ever After?' Larissa begged her current boyfriend Eric Nichols for money to pay for the  procedures in the hopes it would afford her more opportunities.</p>

<p>She left the operating room after getting a boob job, abdominal liposuction, a nose job and a butt enhancing procedure in addition to botox and fillers. </p>

<p> Despite the pricey cost for her beauty, the payoff has been bigger then she had hoped as Larissa's adult content has soared. </p>

<p>Debuting her new enhanced look on the webcam streaming platform CamSoda, Larissa raked in $100K for an hour's worth of lingerie content.    </p>

<p>Due to high demand, it seems as though the fiery Brazilian will be fine without the TLC exposure as she vows to continue riding the adult cam wave. </p>

<p>On Saturday, Larissa kept the content rolling, teasing a photoshoot for her OnlyFans on her Insta-story, as she got full glam.</p>

<p>Her ride on the newfound money train does not come without its challenges, however.  </p>

<p>Before landing at her new home in Colorado Springs last week, Larissa and boyfriend Eric had their Vegas home raided by ICE. </p>

<p>Larissa was then taken into legal custody though there is no knowledge of what sparked the detainment.    </p>

<p> This is not the first time Larissa has landed in hot water with Immigration.  </p>

<p>Boyfriend: Larissa's boyfriend from the TLC spinoff Happily Ever After seemed to foot the bill for her procedures. The two met after Larissa divorced her first husband from the show and have since sold their place in Vegas and moved to Colorado Springs</p>

<p> Larissa married first husband Colt Johnson on Season 6 of the hit show after the pair met online.</p>

<p>Their tumultuous union turned ugly after Larissa was arrested for domestic battery in January 2019, which forced Colt to file for divorce a mere days later and caused a looming risk of deportation for the Brazilian native. </p>

<p>As seen on the show, she seemed to be in the clear after following legal protocol and doing mandated community service. </p>

<p>Despite settling into her new American life, the 33-year-old has two children back in Brazil who she has not seen though she vows she wants to bring them to the US, assuming she does not get deported. </p>
