<p>Speaking about whether there might be  any romantic reunion between the pair in the future, he said: 'No, definitely not, it's just not that type of relationship. </p>

<p>'We went through a mad experience in there which I will never experience with anyone else in my life. I have a lot of love and a lot of respect for her and that will never change.'</p>
