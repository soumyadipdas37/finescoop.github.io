<p>Back to work: Justin Bieber cut a streetwear casual look Friday in Drew House and Fear of God Essentials, as he left a recording studio in Los Angeles, just hours after dropping the Holy music video</p>

<p>The 26-year-old paired an oversized white Fear of God t-shirt with some grey basketball shorts from his own line, printed with 'Drew' across the crotch.</p>

<p>He sported a white pair of the new Yeezy Foam Runners, paired with some blush socks, also featuring the Drew House logo.</p>

<p>Justin finished the casual ensemble with an army green cuffed Nike beanie over his shaggy blond hair.</p>

<p>He ditched the face mask for this outing, as he appeared to bypass any safety precautions on his way into the building. </p>

<p>The Canadian pop star previously dropped the video for Holy, which featured cameos from Chance the Rapper, Wilmer Valderrama and Ryan Destiny.</p>

<p>He teased the song earlier this week on Twitter, as he attempted to shed his often problematic image for something of a moral Christian nature: 'New era. New single. It’s begins.'</p>

<p>Justin plays a laid-off oil rig worker in the video, who ends up homeless along with his wife (Ryan), before being offered a warm plate by a passing soldier (Valderrama).</p>

<p>Although the message doesn't quite land visually, coming from someone who's never had to do manual labor a day in their life, the song appears to be more about how his marriage to wife Hailey, 23, is comparable to his faith in God.</p>

<p>For Hailey: The song appears to be about how his marriage to wife Hailey, 23, is comparable to his faith in God</p>

<p>He sings: 'Runnin' to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy'</p>

<p>The Yummy artist married Hailey in September of 2018 at a New York City courthouse, after reuniting at a Christian conference in June (they originally dated from December, 2015 to January, 2016), and popping the question in July.</p>

<p>He celebrated their second anniversary last weekend on Instagram, writing: '2 years today <?php echo e('@'); ?>haileybieber .. xoxo'</p>

<p>The power couple dropped $25.8million last month on their new home, a 11,145-square-foot, seven-bedroom, 10-bathroom mansion in the upscale Beverly Park neighborhood of Beverly Hills.</p>
