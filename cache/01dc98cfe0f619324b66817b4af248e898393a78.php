<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>European Club Association chairman Andrea Agnelli expects the use of five substitutes across major competitions to alleviate the demands of a 2020-21 season set to be more congested than any other - with the notable exception of the Premier League.</p>

<p>Top-flight clubs in England have opted to revert to three substitutes for the coming season, with Juventus chairman Agnelli saying a majority of clubs in the Premier League wanted to keep five substitutes, but not enough for a 14-majority vote.</p>

<p>He expects this to be one key measure in reducing player workload, with the new season beginning within days of the old one ending.</p>

<p>ECA Chairman Andrea Agnelli expects Europe's top leagues to keep the five substitute rule</p>

<p>The Premier League last week voted to return to the original three subs allowed during a game</p>

<p>'I understand Germany and France have already voted in favour of five substitutes throughout the season, I understand Spain is turning around their decision and making it into five substitutions and I think in Italy the board level of the league has voted in favour of five substitutions,' he said at the ECA's general assembly on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I understand that in England a majority - albeit not a qualified majority of 14 clubs - voted in favour of five substitutions.</p>

<p>'I think we want to make sure that we see this also at international level, in the Champions League, Europa League, so that we have a consistent, harmonised style of play. This was a consensus we had across the general assembly when we discussed it amongst ourselves, especially given the congested calendar.</p>

<p>Agnelli revealed Germany and France have already voted in favour of keeping the rule throughout the 2019-20 season in a bid to reduce player workload after a short off-season</p>

<p>'From October to Christmas, national team players play every three days for three months.'</p>

<p>The game's law-making body, the International Football Association Board announced in July that the five substitutes rule would be extended into 2020-21, but that it would be up to individual competitions whether or not they adopted it.</p>
