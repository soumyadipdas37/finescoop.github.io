<p>Authors have earned as much as £1,500 per word from the sale of their best-selling books, research shows. </p>

<p>British writer J.K. Rowling, who has an estimated net worth of £795million, tops the list with her first Harry Potter book, The Philosopher's Stone, which has brought in approximately £1,563 per word in the 23 years since its release.  </p>

<p>Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho's 1988 novel The Alchemist is the second highest earner at £1,297 per word.</p>

<p>The results of the study (seen above) were collated by analysing 100 of the best-selling books across the world from living authors and taking the number of approximate copies sold worldwide per novel</p>

<p>The analysis was carried out by UK-based training company The Knowledge academy. </p>

<p>Researchers compiled a list of the 100 best-selling books by living authors, ranked by number of copies sold worldwide.</p>

<p>Then the earnings to date of each author were calculated - based on an accepted industry average of 10 per cent net profit participation - before this was divided by the average number of words per book, which works out to approximately 275 per page, according to the study.</p>

<p>In first place on the top 20 list is Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone - which contains 76,944 words.</p>

<p>The debut glimpse at the famous wizard's adventures has seemingly earned J.K. Rowling - who is thought to be worth £795million, according to The Sunday Times Rich List 2020 - a staggering £429,955.16 per page and £1,563.47 per word to date.</p>

<p>The Harry Potter books made roughly £6.1billion, which means J.K. Rowling would have earned between £610million and £915million from the novels when based on the average 10 to 15 per cent of royalties given to an author, according to Fortune. </p>

<p>Ranked as the second highest earning book is The Alchemist - which is around 45,000 words long - by Paulo Coelho. </p>

<p>With the top spot going to Harry Potter and The Philosopher's Stone (pictured left), Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist (pictured right) is the second highest earner in the research by UK-based training company The Knowledge Academy</p>

<p>In fifth, sixth and seventh place are Follow Your Heart (Va’ dove ti porta il cuore) by Susanna Tamaro, Fifty Shades of Grey (pictured) by E. L. James and The Eagle Has Landed by Jack Higgins – they are estimated to make £536.68, £495.87 and £464.36 per word for their writers respectively</p>

<p>Selling at least 65million copies, it earned him £1,297.40 per word (£356,785.71 per page), according to the study. </p>

<p>The novel follows an Andalusian shepherd boy called Santiago, who travels to the pyramids of Egypt, in the hope of finding treasure.</p>

<p>The people he meets impart life-changing wisdom, but he ultimately realises that the treasure was right where he started all along.</p>

<p>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is in third place, adding to J. K. Rowling’s impressive list – it apparently generates £245,111.55 per page and £891.32 for every word written.</p>

<p>As another sequel to a famous series, The Da Vinci Code claims fourth place. The Dan Brown thriller is said to earn an impressive £147,075.66 per page and £534.82 for each term.</p>

<p>In fifth, sixth and seventh place are Follow Your Heart (Va’ dove ti porta il cuore) by Susanna Tamaro, Fifty Shades of Grey by E. L. James and The Eagle Has Landed by Jack Higgins – they are estimated to make £536.68, £495.87 and £464.36 per word for their writers respectively.</p>
