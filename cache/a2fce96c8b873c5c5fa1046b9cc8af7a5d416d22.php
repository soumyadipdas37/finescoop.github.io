<p>Dolphins are aquatic mammals that inhabit every ocean in the world.</p>

<p>There are 36 species of dolphins and most live in the ocean and along coastlines. Some dolphins also inhabit freshwater streams and rivers. </p>

<p>They are grey coloured and have curved mouthes, which resemble a smile, with a row of jagged teeth.  </p>

<p>Dolphins often live in pods that can be made up of twelve or more animals. </p>

<p>They are intensely social and communicate with squeaks, whistles, and clicks.  </p>

<p>Dolphins mainly feed on fish and squid and use echolocation, a built-in sonar, that bounces sound waves off prey to reveal its location and size. </p>

<p>They are playful and curious creatures that are known to interact with humans.</p>
