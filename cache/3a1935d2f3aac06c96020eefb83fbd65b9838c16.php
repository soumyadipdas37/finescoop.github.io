<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joao Moutinho has urged Wolves' record buy Fabio Silva to express himself and is relishing looking after the club's young stars.</p>

<p>The midfielder knows Silva can shine in the Premier League and his next chance comes on Sunday with a trip to West Ham.</p>

<p>Silva, 18, became Wolves' record signing when he joined from Porto in a deal worth £35million this month while defender Ki-Jana Hoever, 18, completed a £9m switch from Liverpool.</p>

<p>Joao Moutinho has urged Wolves' record £35m signing Fabio Silva to express himself</p>

<p>Striker Silva, 18, missed a sitter on his debut as Wolves lost to Stoke in the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>Striker Silva missed a sitter on his debut as Wolves lost to Stoke in the Carabao Cup earlier this month but Moutinho expects him to prove himself.</p>

<p>'He has great potential. He's a young guy who needs to continue to work, to show the qualities he has,' he said.</p>

<p>'I think he has everything to show how good he is, and we will try to help him improve and learn every day with us - and with Raul (Jimenez) as they play the same position.</p>

<p>'It's important because young players come and like to learn. I think it's great to have him.</p>

<p>But 34-year-old midfielder Moutinho knows Silva can shine in the Premier League</p>

<p>'I like to help young people, but I try to learn with them too. We are all learning every day. If we think we know everything, we stop improving. I try to teach what I know, with my experience, so we are better than the last day.</p>

<p>'I have responsibility, like they have. It doesn't come only with age. We all have our responsibilities.'</p>

<p>Nelson Semedo is in line for a debut after joining from Barcelona this week as Wolves look to hit back after a 3-1 defeat to Manchester City on Monday.</p>

<p>Moutinho believes Fabio Silva can learn a lot from him and team-mate Raul Jimenez</p>

<p>They have won all four games against the Hammers - without conceding - since returning to the Premier League in 2018 and Moutinho wants to get back on track.</p>

<p>'It's not the start we wanted, we won the first game and lost the second one to a team that wants to win the Premier League,' he told the club's official site.</p>

<p>'We know what we have done well and what we need to work on, and so we will continue to work - to do our best to win the next game. That's the most important thing.'</p>
