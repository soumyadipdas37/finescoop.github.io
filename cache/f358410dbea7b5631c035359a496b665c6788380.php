<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>AC Milan are believed to have overtaken Barcelona as favourites to land Lyon winger Memphis Depay.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman has been heavily linked with a move to bring the Depay, who he knows from his days as the Dutch national coach, to the Nou Camp this summer.</p>

<p>But Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas claimed that his opposite number Josep Bartomeu, told him the La Liga club cannot afford to buy the 26-year-old who is valued at £28m.</p>

<p>Memphis Depay has entered the final year of his contract at Lyon and could be set to move</p>

<p>Stefano Pioli's AC Milan now look like favourites to sign the Dutchman this summer</p>

<p>Now Diario AS have reported that the Serie A giants have overtaken Barcelona in the race for the Dutch winger.</p>

<p>Stefano Pioli's side are interested in bringing Depay, who is in the last year of his deal, to the club in exchange for Lucas Paqueta. </p>

<p>Depay has no intent on extending his current deal which expires in July 2021, while Paqueta is currently under control until 2023.</p>

<p>However, the Brazilian international has struggled to command a first team spot in Milan, with just 24 league starts and one goal during his two seasons in Italy.</p>

<p>Koeman himself reportedly admitted that he struggles to believe Depay would join the club.</p>

<p>'For Depay to arrive, you must first sell,' the Barca boss told Fox Sports Netherlands.</p>

<p>'We're working towards the new season and I think we will go into it with the same group of players that we have now for pre-season.'</p>

<p>Barca's finances have taken a severe hit following the coronavirus outbreak, with Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas claiming that has damaged Barca's chances of completing a move for Depay, who has played under Koeman with the Dutch national team.</p>

<p>Depay was believed to be seen as a replacement for Luis Suarez who traveled to Italy to undergo a citizenship test, ahead of a proposed move to Juventus.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman would like Depay at the Nou Camp but believes that the move is unlikely</p>

<p>A move to Barcelona would see him reunited with Koeman, and play alongside Lionel Messi who made a U-turn on his initial decision to leave the Nou Camp. </p>

<p>Depay scored 11 goals across his last 18 matches for the Dutch national side and has also developed into the star attacking player at Lyon – netting 53 goals in 136 appearances. </p>

<p>Having recovered from a serious knee injury earlier in the season, Memphis helped lead Lyon to the semi-finals of last season’s Champions League.</p>

<p>Depay made a fantastic start to the new season for Lyon scoring a hat-trick in their opening day 4-1 victory over Dijon.</p>
