<p>Family:  Millie Mackintosh has marked her first four months of motherhood by reflecting on the highs and lows of becoming a mum to her adorable daughter Sienna</p>

<p>However Millie explained that getting into a routine and trying to be 'more relaxed' despite having 'always suffered with anxiety' has helped in an essay for Sheerluxe.  </p>

<p>One of the most difficult times for the new mum came when Sienna was diagnosed with hip dysplasia at three-months-old and had to wear a harness for six to 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Millie said: 'I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t beside myself with worry; the whole experience made me realise I have a lifetime of worry ahead of me.'</p>

<p>She explained how although Sienna did cry at first, she soon got used to the harness with Millie praising babies for being so adaptable. </p>

<p>Doting: The former Made In Chelsea star said she's trying to be 'more relaxed' after she was left 'beside herself with worry' after Sienna was diagnosed with hip dysplasia </p>

<p>Reflecting some more on the past four months, doting mother Millie admitted it has been tricky adjusting to her new sleep schedule saying her 'brain has gone to mush'. </p>

<p>She added: 'The lack of time for self-care or just to be "me" takes its toll sometimes, and then there’s the pressure to be the "perfect mother". But I’m doing the best I can – for myself and my family.'   </p>

<p>Discussing her pregnancy, Millie said it wasn't the easiest of times and that during her third trimester she found it difficult to walk because of pelvic pain.</p>

<p>She also said she started having cramps, adding: 'I had this irrational fear something was wrong... I was worried I might lose the baby, but with every scan that fear started to ease.'  </p>

<p>Parents: Millie and her husband Hugo Taylor welcomed their first child back in May</p>

<p>Millie gave birth to Sienna in May during the coronavirus pandemic and national lockdown, something which she said was 'daunting'.</p>

<p>However although hating the idea of not being able to have her husband with her during the delivery, Millie said that her main concern was Sienna's wellbeing. </p>

<p>She added that her 'primal instincts' kicked in and that Hugo did get to be with her for a few hours at the hospital after their daughter was born.  </p>

<p>As for getting back to work, Millie said it was tricky at first but that she's been slowly making a start at getting back after five weeks off and utilising nap time to get things done.  </p>

<p>Millie shared in August that baby Sienna had been diagnosed with hip dysplasia at three-months-old. </p>

<p>Only recently, the influencer revealed that her daughter is back to her 'usually smiley self' and she was 'remaining positive' following the diagnosis.   </p>

<p>The new mum uploaded a sweet snap of herself cradling her baby girl as she wore her harness.</p>

<p>Declaring she and sunglasses entrepreneur Hugo are 'remaining positive', the TV star said she's 'delighted' her little one has managed to 'adapt really quickly' and expressed her gratitude towards fans who have shared helpful advice. </p>

<p>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) occurs when the ball and socket joint does not form properly in babies and young children.</p>

<p>The hip joint connects the thigh bone, or femur, to the pelvis. The top of the femur is ball shaped and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket.</p>

<p>In DDH, the hip socket is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place. This causes the hip joint to be loose. In severe cases, it can dislocate.</p>

<p>DDH can affect one or both hips. It is more common in the left hip, as well as in girls and firstborn children.</p>

<p>One or two in every 1,000 babies have DDH that requires treatment.</p>

<p>This may include a fabric splint, called a Pavlik harness, which secures the hips in a stable position so they can grow normally.</p>

<p>If this does not work, or the child is over six months at the time of diagnosis, surgery may be required to place the ball of the femur in the hip socket. </p>

<p>Left untreated, DDH can cause patients to develop a limp, hip pain or oestoarthritis. </p>
