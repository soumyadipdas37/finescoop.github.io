<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Block's Luke and Jasmin have broken their silence on the explosive 'copygate' saga that rocked The Block on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>The couple, who were accused by Shaynna Blaze of plagiarising their winning children's bedroom, shared a public statement to Instagram on Wednesday insisting they didn't knowingly break the rules.  </p>

<p>'We were just working happily on our kitchen when Shaynna popped in to give us a slap on the wrist for copying. Our faces said it all, we were in shock,' they began.</p>

<p>Their side of the story:  The Block's Luke and Jasmin (pictured) have broken their silence on Tuesday night's 'cheating scandal', insisting they didn't knowingly break the rules by taking 'inspiration' from a Byron Bay holiday home</p>

<p>The couple claimed they were upfront about their use of inspiration images from design companies such as The Designory during renovations.  </p>

<p>'All week we were showing our moodboard which featured the room from the The Designory (and other images). We were open about using it and believed it was all above board,' they wrote.   </p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin also reminded viewers that a similar controversy took place on The Block in 2017, when teammates Ronnie and Georgia were accused by other contestants of copying their winning room from a design they found on Pinterest.  </p>

<p>Spot the difference: The couple claimed were upfront about their use of inspiration images from design companies such as The Designory. Pictured left is Luke and Jasmin's renovation, right is the Barefoot Escapes holiday home in Byron Bay designed by The Designory agency</p>

<p>Ronnie and Georgia were cleared of any wrongdoing by the judges, however.  </p>

<p>'At the time, a channel 9 spokesperson stated, 'The only rule is that contestants don't enlist the help of a professional interior designer. There is no limit on the boundaries to which contestants can take an inspiration image and draw on latest trends for their rooms',' Luke and Jasmin reminded fans.  </p>

<p>'So this is our understanding of the show 'rules' with regards to copying. Rules, which we haven't broken,' they continued. </p>

<p>'We know that other contestants this season have copied images for their rooms': The twosome also insisted that 'copying' is commonplace among The Block's cast this season</p>

<p>The twosome also insisted that 'copying' is commonplace among The Block's cast this season. </p>

<p>'We know that other contestants this season have copied images for their rooms. We hope it adds as much value to their house as possible,' they wrote.  </p>

<p>They ended their post by explaining that there is a simple reason for why they took inspiration from an existing design - to make sure their room was 'on-trend'.  </p>

<p>Support: Meanwhile, The Block judge Shaynna shared a lengthy statement to Instagram urged viewers to stop trolling the couple, and Jasmin in particular, hours after Tuesday night's episode </p>

<p>'We set out to create an on-trend home and there will always be current design trends that feature in homes built at the same time, by people who scroll the same feeds as us,' they declared.  </p>

<p>It came after Shaynna shared a lengthy statement to Instagram urged viewers to stop trolling the couple, and Jasmin in particular, hours after Tuesday night's episode. </p>

<p>While the interior design guru defended her remarks about the couple's room being plagiarised, she did acknowledge the possibility that the WA team had copied their room without even realising it. </p>

<p>Speaking out: In a lengthy post to Instagram, the interior design guru defended her remarks about the couple's room being plagiarised, but did acknowledge the possibility that the WA team had copied their room without even realising it</p>

<p>'We're living in the world of Instagram and Pinterest so it's inevitable that sometimes the lines blur between 'taking inspiration' and direct copying,' Shaynna began.</p>

<p>She added that it was 'imperative we all consider other designers' intellectual property rights when we are designing for profit'.  </p>

<p>In light of this, Shaynna said she had no choice but to 'have a difficult conversation' with Luke and Jasmin after noticing the 'many similarities' between their renovation and the Barefoot Escapes holiday home in Byron Bay designed by The Designory agency.</p>

<p>While she stood by her position that House 4 had crossed the line, she also made it clear there was no excuse for trolling.</p>

<p>'Please don't direct any negativity towards Jasmin on social media, and instead let's all take a look at our own appreciation of design and other designers, and our personal understanding of the difference between imitation and plagiarism,' she concluded.</p>

<p>Lesson learned: She added that it was 'imperative we all consider other designers' intellectual property rights when we are designing for profit'</p>
