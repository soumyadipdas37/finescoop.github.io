<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria has recorded 45 new coronavirus cases and four deaths as anti-lockdown protesters prepare to rally in Melbourne again.</p>

<p>The new cases reported on Friday come after the state's daily infections dropped to 28 on Thursday - the first time the figures have been in the 20s since June 24. </p>

<p>The daily update comes as disgruntled Melburnians revealed they are planning to take to the streets again in protest of the city's lockdown restrictions. </p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner Rick Nugent told 3AW's Neil Mitchell police received a warning email from a protester.  </p>

<p>'The organiser of the protest sent an email to us … advising us that if we refuse to allow them we will be jeopardising the safety of others and Victoria Police would be putting all Victorians at risk,' he said.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, we're just going to have to continue to drag police off other functions and other roles to police these people in the city. </p>

<p>It will be the third weekend protesters have gathered at inner-city landmarks to rally against the state government's Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne. </p>

<p>More to come </p>
