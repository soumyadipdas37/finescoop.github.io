<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>James Maddison is a doubt for Leicester’s season opener at West Brom on Sunday after playing no part in the club’s pre-season preparations.</p>

<p>Maddison played in only three of Leicester’s 10 matches following the restart due to a hip problem, which he aggravated in the 2-1 defeat at Everton on July 1. He later had surgery.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old recently signed a new four-year deal worth about £100,000 a week at the King Power Stadium and his return cannot come soon enough. </p>

<p>James Maddison has not been involved in Leicester's pre-season preparations after an injury</p>

<p>Leicester will be hoping he returns to action quickly after he starred during last season</p>

<p>Leicester have problems in defence so Wilfried Ndidi might have to play as a centre back</p>

<p>Maddison was a star of Leicester’s early-season march up the Premier League table and ended the campaign with six goals and three assists, attracting interest from Manchester United.</p>

<p>Leicester are also struggling in defence ahead of their trip to the Hawthorns, where holding midfielder Wilfred Ndidi may have to play as a centre back.</p>

<p>Jonny Evans is absent through suspension after he was sent off on the last day of the 2019-20 campaign against United and veteran Wes Morgan is struggling with a hamstring injury. So Ndidi may slot in alongside Caglar Soyuncu in central defence.</p>

<p>Manager Brendan Rodgers could give a debut to Timothy Castagne, the wing-back who joined from Atalanta to replace Chelsea’s £50million signing Ben Chilwell, while fringe players like midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall and defender Josh Knight may also be involved.</p>
