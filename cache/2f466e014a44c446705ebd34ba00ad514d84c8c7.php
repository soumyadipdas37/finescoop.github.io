<p>You've got a friend in me: Danielle Mason enjoyed a business meeting with notorious South London gangster Jimmy Tippett at Mayfair's Sexy Fish restaurant on Wednesday</p>

<p>The reality star told us: 'He is my mate and we were having a business meeting. I had  a bad bust up with Tony and Jimmy has been really good to talk to.'</p>

<p>Danielle and Jimmy put on a cosy display as they discussed work matters over hot beverages at the Asian eatery.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two called it quits from her traveller spouse Tony in October 2019 after he claimed he was single on social media.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun at the time: 'Danielle saw Tony's relationship status was set to single on Facebook and wasn't happy at all.</p>

<p>Drama: The ex-Gypsies Next Door star, 37, exclusively revealed to MailOnline that he has offered her a shoulder to cry on after a 'bad bust up' with her ex Tony Giles (pictured in 2012)</p>

<p>Warm greetings: The glamour model appeared in great spirits as she engaged in a lively conversation with the career criminal, 48</p>

<p>'He has been really good to talk to': The pals shared a friendly kiss as they sat outside the Asian eatery</p>

<p>"She's spoken proudly of their relationship this year after they got things back on track and feels it was disrespectful.'</p>

<p>The former couple, who share Rudy, nine and Delilah, seven, tied the knot in 2012, but split in 2016 and later reunited. </p>

<p>The glamour model's new pal Jimmy is the son of south London enforcer and boxer Jimmy Tippett Snr, who counted the Kray twins and Mad Frankie Fraser as family friends.</p>

<p>Past drama: Jimmy was previously jailed in 2018 for stealing a diamond ring, just months after an identical offence</p>

<p>Catching up: Danielle and Jimmy put on a cosy display as they discussed work matters over hot beverages</p>

<p>Background: The TV star's new friend is the son of south London enforcer and boxer Jimmy Tippett Snr, who counted the Kray twins and Mad Frankie Fraser as family friends</p>

<p>Known as the 'governor of Lewisham' from the 60s to the 80s, his father ruled his manor with an iron fist, winning every bare-knuckled fight he got into on the cobbles.</p>

<p>Jimmy had planned to make a film based on his book Born Gangster about how he 'first got arrested when he was 12 and, by the time he was 16, was visiting Reggie Kray in prison'.</p>

<p>Two years ago, he returned to prison on a 30-month sentence for stealing a diamond ring not long after he was freed from jail for an almost identical offence.</p>

<p>New friendship: The duo embarked on a stroll across the streets of the English city</p>

<p>Reformed: Jimmy had previously planned to make a film based on his book Born Gangster about how he 'first got arrested when he was 12'</p>

<p>Turning heads: The younger half-sister of EastEnders star Jessie Wallace stunned in a black blouse, a satin skirt and animal print boots</p>

<p>Catching the eye: The media personality amped up the glamour by styling her outfit with a designer chain-strap handbag and belt</p>

<p>The court heard that in March 2017 he and an associate tricked the mother of jewellery designer Tatiana Sieff into showing him a diamond and emerald encrusted ring, which he then spirited away while she was in a hotel toilet.  </p>

<p>Jimmy was freed from a 27-month sentence he was given in 2013 for a similar 'confidence trick' theft from another jewellery dealer.</p>

<p>In that case, he then distracted a woman and disappeared with the jewellery, in that case worth about £250,000. It is unclear when he was released from his latest sentence.</p>
