<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kai Havertz admits his £89million move to Chelsea still feels surreal - but the Germany star has vowed not to be weighed down by pressure or expectation at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old became the joint-most expensive player signed by a British club when he arrived from Bayer Leverkusen earlier this month.</p>

<p>'Of course I watched the Premier League as a kid, very often with my family and with my parents,' he said.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz says it's a 'dream' to play in the Premier League and for Chelsea after finally joining</p>

<p>'Now it seems a bit unreal for me and my family that I am sitting here for a club like Chelsea… I was dreaming as a kid to play in the Premier League and for Chelsea as well, a very big club and one of the best in the world.'</p>

<p>He added: 'For me the dream came true very early. I'm just 21.'</p>

<p>The move puts him alongside Paul Pogba, who also cost Manchester United £89m when he re-signed from Juventus in 2016.</p>

<p>The Frenchman has since faced unrelenting scrutiny but Havertz is relaxed about justifying his fee.</p>

<p>'Of course it's a big price tag but I think in football today it is normal to pay these prices,' he said.</p>

<p>'I will not put a lot of pressure on myself because I think I am doing not the best or the worst because the price tag is that high. I am trying to focus on football and trying to play my best football here in Chelsea and not put pressure on myself. I'm just playing football, I love to play football. That's why I'm here.'</p>

<p>He added: 'It took very long, but now I am here I am very happy to be here and I think I have settled in very well.'</p>

<p>Havertz made his debut in Chelsea's win over Brighton this week, featuring alongside compatriot and fellow new boy Timo Werner. The pair are friends and have played together for Germany.</p>

<p>'I am very excited to play with him together - he is a big friend of mine and of course when you have a friend in your team it is always easier to play,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is a big step to come to another country, culture and language. It is very different than before and that takes some weeks to adapt to, but I am looking forward to it. I am very happy that Timo is here as well… I think we will have a good German connection in the team now.'</p>

<p>Havertz played across midfield and the forward line for Leverkusen and is now excited to learn from Frank Lampard, himself a prolific scorer from deep.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old feels he is best as a No 10 but wants to remain versatile after sealing the 'perfect' next step in his career, which continues against Liverpool on Sunday.</p>

<p>'Obviously I need a little time to adapt to the league. It's very different to Germany but I'm looking forward to it and I think on Sunday it will be the first improvement for me.'</p>
