<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of motorists heading to Europe are facing 10 hour delays and nine mile queues at the Port of Dover today after police conduct spot checks in a major 'ongoing' operation.  </p>

<p>Lorries trying to access Dover docks in southern England have been brought to a standstill as Kent Police officers check every vehicle as part of Operation Stack, a force for the spokesman said. </p>

<p>The Channel Tunnel in Folkestone has also been brought to a standstill, forcing the coastbound M20 between Junctions 8 and 9 to be turned into a lorry park for freight vehicles queuing for the port.  </p>

<p>Operation Stack was implemented at 11am today and stood down at 12pm. All non-freight traffic has been advised to use the A20, A2 and M2. Kent Police have refused to say why they were conducting spot checks. </p>

<p>However, a spokesman for the Port of Dover told MailOnline that Operation Stack was launched following an 'incident' at the port yesterday. They would not be drawn on further questions. </p>

<p>Kent Police said: 'A policing operation involving vehicle and passenger checks at Kent ports has been stood down. Border control checks are now returning to normality.'</p>

<p>Operation Stack is a procedure used by Kent Police and the Port of Dover to park (or 'stack') lorries on the M20 motorway in Kent when services across the English Channel, such as those through the Channel Tunnel or from the Port of Dover, are disrupted.</p>

<p>Operation Stack is managed by Kent Police using powers under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and coordinated by a multi-agency group known as Operation Fennel.</p>

<p>According to Damian Green MP, by 2007 the system had been implemented 74 times in the 20 years since it was first introduced. </p>

<p>Operation Stack is ordinarily implemented whenever there is an urgent need to inhibit the flow of traffic to the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Dover, which handle 90 per cent of freight traffic between the UK and Europe. </p>

<p>There are officially only 550 parking spaces for HGVs in Kent, so if access to cross-channel services is restricted, congestion would quickly spread across the county.</p>

<p>The most common causes of Operation Stack are severe weather that either cancels or restricts ferry services, industrial action at the French ports of Calais, Dunkirk and Boulogne, and electrical failures in the Channel Tunnel.</p>

<p>In a statement published on its website, the Port of Dover said: 'Kent Police have been checking all vehicles and passengers since 15 September 2020 as part of a wider operation in Kent and on all short strait routes.</p>

<p>'Port of Dover received notification that Operation Stack (Stage 1) has been implemented on the M20 between J8 - J9 Coastbound.</p>

<p>'We are working with our ferry partners to keep the traffic moving and we would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused to our customers and local community.'</p>

<p>Ferry operator P&amp;O Ferries also said: 'Due to a special operation, the Kent Police are currently checking all freight and tourist vehicles, and therefore the traffic in and around Dover is very heavy and causing extraordinary delays.</p>

<p>They added: 'At port, the buffer zone is currently full, with Dover TAP in place. Check-in is clear and you will be placed on the first available sailing.'</p>

<p>Increased security was implemented yesterday at around 7am, police said. But congestion continued for the rest of the day and through last night into this morning.</p>

<p>Ferry operator DFDS advised customers to 'allow additional time to complete the check-in process' and they would be permitted to board the next crossing if they miss their allocated slot due to traffic.</p>

<p>The Port of Dover tweeted: 'The situation at the Port currently remains. There is heavy traffic congestion around Dover with queues on both the A20 and A2 routes into the town. Please leave extra journey time for your trip.'</p>

<p>Huge delays built as Dover TAP, a traffic management system which queues freight on the left lane of the A20 to keep local town traffic flowing, was introduced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Once the A20 is full, lorries are forced to wait between junctions 8 and 9 of the M20 near Ashford.</p>

<p>But local resident Kate Leech tweeted: 'It (Dover Tap) doesn't work! The whole town is gridlocked as are the surrounding villages with lorries cutting through. Kids can't even get to school. It's a disaster.'</p>

<p>Local resident Abi Sale reported hearing 'a lot of sirens' just before 11.30am.</p>

<p>She tweeted: 'Lots of traffic all through the Dover area for two days due to increased security checks <?php echo e('@'); ?>Port_of_Dover and now a lot of sirens.</p>

<p>'Hope all are OK. Authorities aren't telling us why at the moment.'</p>

<p>One lorry attempting to avoid the gridlock managed to bring down overhead power cables and two large conifers as they navigated the back roads of the village of Shepherdswell near Dover.</p>

<p>UK-based courier service Freight Logistics Solutions said some of their drivers crawling coastbound into Dover were reporting delays of more than 10 hours.</p>

<p>They tweeted: 'HEADS UP - freight chaos on the roads this morning - huge delays building at Port of Dover and Eurotunnel. Increased security &amp; border checks at the tunnel, traffic scheme Dover TAP has queues of nine miles+ building. We have a few drivers in the Q saying 10 hours delay!'</p>
