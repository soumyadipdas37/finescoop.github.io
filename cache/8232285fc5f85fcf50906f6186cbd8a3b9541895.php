<p>A member of the Tablelands Yowie Sightings Facebook group posted several photos that were taken by a bushwalker near the Eignsleigh River in far North Queensland.</p>

<p>The images show a large pile of dung resting on a mound that had been broken open.</p>

<p>Yowie hunters are in a frenzy after discovering a pile of poo on a termite mound (pictured) they believe is evidence of the supernatural Australian beast</p>

<p>A member of the Tablelands Yowie Sightings Facebook group posted several photos that were taken by a bushwalker near the Eignsleigh River in far North Queensland</p>

<p>'Whatever did this decided to break the termite mound and poo on it. No animal I know off would/could do that,' the group member wrote.</p>

<p>'Also the poo looks nothing like pig, roo, emu etc.  </p>

<p>The Yowie is a creature of Australian folklore that resembles Bigfoot. </p>

<p>Its legend dates back to ancient Aboriginal oral history and although no proof of the elusive entity has ever been found, numerous bushwalkers in remote parts of the country claim to see Yowies every year.</p>

<p>The group member who took the photo noted the scat was 'fresh'.   </p>

<p>'(He) was all alone and knew whatever did this was not far away,' the poster said. </p>

<p>'Walking on he started to feel as if something was watching him. Not far from that, he came across the railway sleepers in the tree!</p>

<p>'I know people often see tree limbs placed oddly up in trees and suspect yowie activity but limbs can fall from above naturally.</p>

<p>'A bloody heavy railway sleeper in a tree ain't natural!!!'</p>

<p>Not far from the termite mound, the bushwalker came across the railway sleepers in a tree (pictured)</p>

<p>Hightailing it out of there, the bushwalker said he had an ominous feeling he wasn't welcome.</p>

<p>As he headed out of the bush, he felt like he was 'being watched'.</p>

<p>Still feeling uneasy about the encounter several hours later, he eventually made it to the Einsleigh pub where he 'knocked down a couple of rums to calm down'.</p>

<p>When John from behind the bar asked what was wrong, the bushwalker explained what happened.  </p>

<p>'John wasn't surprised and shared some other similar stories from the area,' the poster said. </p>

<p>Pictured is an alleged sighting of a Yowie on Queensland's Sunshine Coast. But the photo's authenticity has not been proven</p>
