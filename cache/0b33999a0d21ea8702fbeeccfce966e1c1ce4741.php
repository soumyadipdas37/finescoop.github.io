<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He's made no secret of his love of vaping, having shamelessly puffed on his electronic cigarette while sitting in the audience at the Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2016.</p>

<p>But it wasn't always that way.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that while in his early 20s, Leonardo DiCaprio went to great lengths to keep his nicotine habit hidden from his mother, Irmelin Indenbirken.  </p>

<p>Don't tell mama! Leonardo DiCaprio once tried to hide the fact that he smoked when he was younger from his mother Irmelin Indenbirken (pictured at the 2014 Oscars) </p>

<p>When the 45-year-old Oscar-winner was still an up and coming star, he was said to be concerned about his image, particularly when it came to smoking. </p>

<p>Photographer Steve Eichner - who is promoting his new book In the Limelight: The Visual Ecstasy of NYC Nightlife in the ’90s - has recounted an exchange between himself and a then-20-year-old Leo in New York. </p>

<p>Eichner tells PageSix in an interview that he once snapped Leo at Club USA in 1994, buying something from a 'cigarette-and-candy girl' but the young star wasn't happy about being caught in the act.  </p>

<p>He claims Leo came over and said 'Hey man, can you do me a favor and please don't use that photo? You can take photos of me tonight.' </p>

<p>When asked what the problem was, Leo is alleged to have told Eichner: 'I was buying cigarettes, and I don't want my mom to know that I smoke.' </p>

<p>The Revenant star is known to be extremely close to his mother, Irmelin, who is also an actress and producer. </p>

<p>PageSix also notes that Johnny Depp backed up the claims, as he seemingly made a reference to it at the 2016 Santa Barbara International Film Festival. </p>

<p>During the event, Depp told a story about how his young What's Eating Gilbert Grape co-star asked him for a smoke.</p>

<p>'No, I will not give you a drag of my cigarette while you hide from your mother again, Leo,' Depp reportedly recalled himself saying to the young actor. </p>

<p>These days however, Leo doesn't even bother to hide his need for a nicotine fix. </p>

<p>At the 2016 Screen Actors Guild Awards, the thespian was seen puffing from his vape while suited up in a tux watching the ceremony. </p>

<p>Leo's mother Irmelin worked with her son on the 2007 documentary The 11th Hour, on the current state of the natural environment and the damage of global warming and climate change. </p>
