<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chessington World of Adventures is offering visitors personalised face masks showing terrified expressions for photos as they enjoy the theme park's rides.</p>

<p>Thrill seekers would normally race to see their hilarious pictures after going on the attractions but they now have to wear coverings on many due to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The 'coaster faces', which start from £6.80, were introduced to the Surrey resort so riders will still get fun souvenir snaps to take home.</p>

<p>Visitors have to upload pictures of how they think their faces will look when going on popular rides such as Dragon's Fury and Rattlesnake.</p>

<p>Their mouths are then printed on to face coverings, which look like people's normal reactions to the rollercoasters.</p>

<p>The hurriedly established facility, which had six stations made up of an open ended tent and portable hit, was first used by NHS staff but is now open to the public.</p>

<p>Pictures showed few cars enter and leave the site earlier in the pandemic, when it was made to cater for hundreds.</p>

<p>Even the few NHS staff who did arrive were only admitted if they had an email confirming an appointment, and NHS ID.</p>

<p>The nearest testing centres to those living in the far west of London are Chessington, Heathrow and Twickenham.</p>
