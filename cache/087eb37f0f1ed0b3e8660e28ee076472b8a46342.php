<p>Crisis! A former Strictly Come Dancing crew member tested POSITIVE for coronavirus, just days before recording on the new series is set to begin (Pictured: Reigning champions Oti Mabuse and Kelvin Fletcher)</p>

<p>According to The Sun, the lighting expert spent a week working on the dance contest's set.</p>

<p>Following his positive test result, at least five staff who were in close contact with him were sent home and told to self-isolate and await tests of their own, according to the report.</p>

<p>Additionally, a deep clean of the set using powerful electrostatic sprayers, was apparently ordered. </p>

<p>The publication's source also claimed that panic spread quickly among the professional dancers who were due to start filming in the studios tomorrow.  </p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'the crew member is no longer on the production and has had a negative NHS test result.</p>

<p>'Procedures were followed and stringent protocols have been put in place just in case, but recording isn't due to happen until later this week so there is minimal impact.' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Strictly Come Dancing for comment. </p>
