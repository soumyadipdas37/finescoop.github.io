<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal are anticipating a third bid from Aston Villa for Emiliano Martinez as they hold out for close to £20million for the goalkeeper.</p>

<p>Villa's most recent offer was thought to have been around the £15m mark and was short of what the Gunners were looking for, but they are unlikely to give up their pursuit at this stage.</p>

<p>Martinez has rejected Arsenal's latest offer of a new contract, boosting Villa's hopes of luring him away.</p>

<p>Arsenal are anticipating a third bid from Aston Villa for £20m-rated goalkeeper Emi Martinez</p>

<p>Neither the wages or guaranteed game time Arsenal have offered have yet been enough to persuade Martinez to extend his current deal which expires in 2022.</p>

<p>And the Argentinian is weighing up the prospect of a move to Villa knowing they do want him as first choice as Tom Heaton is still sidelined with a knee injury.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old, who wants to be a No.1 to boost his international prospects, has been seeking to understand how regularly he is likely to play under Mikel Arteta, with Bernd Leno now fit again.</p>

<p>Martinez shone last season when deputising for the injured Leno but the German is expected to be first choice once more this season, even though Martinez was given the nod when Arsenal beat Liverpool on penalties in the Community Shield last month.</p>

<p>Dean Smith is eager to bring in another stopper as Tom Heaton continues recovery from injury</p>

<p>The Argentinian wants first team football and has rejected Arsenal's latest contract offer</p>

<p>Current Villa keepers Orjan Nyland and Lovre Kalinic are believed to be surplus to requirements, while Jed Steer has not played since damaging his Achilles tendon at Wolves last November.</p>

<p>Yet Steer is highly regarded by Smith and if no keeper has been signed before the Sheffield United game, he may start.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, David Raya is prepared to hand in a transfer request to try and force through a move to Arsenal.</p>

<p>The Gunners have identified Brentford keeper Raya, 24, as a potential replacement for Martinez, having previously taken the Bees goalkeeping coach Inaki Cana Pavon last December.</p>

<p>A potential replacement is David Raya who may force a move with a transfer request</p>

<p>Raya is desperate to make the move as he feels a switch to Arsenal would be an opportunity that is too good to turn down and has told Brentford he wants to leave.</p>

<p>But the frustrated Spaniard's pleas have so far fallen on deaf ears with the Championship side refusing to discuss letting him go, leaving Raya weighing up putting his desire to go in writing if Brentford continue to stand firm.</p>
