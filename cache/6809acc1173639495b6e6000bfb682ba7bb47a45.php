<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The sky-rocketing rise of Daniel Dubois towards a world heavyweight title challenge has been boosted further by his launching into the top ten of the WBC rankings.</p>

<p>This recognition for the hottest prospect in boxing's marquee division comes at a time when the heavyweight ratings by the major sanctioning bodies are in a more diverse state of flux than for many a year.</p>

<p>Dynamite Daniel had already been promoted from nowhere to No 3 by the WBO.</p>

<p>If that was a mite premature for a 22-year-old after only 15 fights - albeit every one a victory and all but one by knock-out - his elevation to eighth by the highly respected WBC brings serious credibility to claims that he will be a threat to the established order of Tyson Fury, Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder as early as next summer.</p>

<p>Daniel Dubois's stock is rising, as the 23-year-old makes a name for himself in boxing</p>

<p>Dubois has shot up the rankings, now deemed eighth by the highly respected WBC</p>

<p>Promoter Frank Warren has no doubts, saying: 'Daniel against Joshua would be a great fight right now and actually I would give him the edge. Next year he will be more than ready.' </p>

<p>There can be no doubt that Dubois is one of the most lethal punchers in the ring today, that power reinforced by a concrete chin.</p>

<p>Those gifts have made it scarily difficult for his opponents thus far to survive enough rounds to give him the experience any young fighter needs. </p>

<p>Hopefully some of that will come with his British championship defence against silver Olympian Joe Joyce which is scheduled for London's 02 on October 24, coronavirus permitting.</p>

<p>Even before that, he is shaking up the rankings. The extent of which is evident in the conflicting alpha-belt tables compiled below, as well as the Ring magazine assessment.</p>

<p>Personally, I also place Dubois seventh.</p>

<p>What most judges do agree upon is that this obsessively dedicated south Londoner with the sledgehammer fists is the young man is a world champion in the making.</p>
