<p>Selfie: Gareth and Chloe put on a loved-up display in the snaps and Gareth captioned the snaps on his Instagram Story: 'Happy birthday baby. Have the best day beautiful'</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. </p>

<p>'They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'</p>

<p>Indeed, comments materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth commenting 'Mmmmm' under one sexy snap of Chloe's.</p>

<p>In February, Gareth was linked to his panto co-star Hannah Grace Lawson, but this appeared to just be a friendship. </p>

<p>Posting a snap to Instagram in July, he captioned it: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'</p>

<p>The pair starred in Cinderella over the Christmas period at Nottingham's Theatre Royal for five weeks, when Hannah portrayed the leading character, while Gareth played Prince Charming.</p>

<p>Gareth was married to dancer Suzanne Mole from 2008 until 2012, with whom he shares daughter Missy, 10.</p>

<p>He met his Corrie star ex Faye, 32, when they featured in Legally Blonde: The Musical, and went public with their relationship in August 2013. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April'</p>

<p>In September 2018, it was reported Faye and Gareth briefly ended their relationship when the singer's 'very controlling' behaviour led to a series of furious rows.</p>

<p>But by November they decided to give the relationship another try, with Faye pulling out of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! to spend time with him. </p>

<p>In a move that shocked fans, the singer asked her to marry him while they were on holiday in New York on New Year's Eve.   </p>

<p>Way back when: The Pop Idol runner-up was said to have found love with the Ibiza regular as he neared the one year mark of his split from fiancée Faye Brooks (pictured in June 2018)</p>

<p>Previously discussing the reason behind their first break-up, Gareth told OK! magazine: 'There was a lot of strain on our relationship because I was always away with work and Faye's schedule was getting even busier so we decided we needed some breathing space.' </p>

<p>During the proposal he performed a 17-minute song about their relationship before getting down on one knee to offer Faye a £30,000 engagement ring.</p>

<p>But by mid-July this year Faye reportedly moved out of their shared flat. They announced they had split for good in August. </p>

<p>The soap star confirmed her new romance with personal trainer Joe Davies in late November as they make their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night.</p>
