<p>Big news: Frankie Muniz and his newlywed wife Paige Price Muniz took to YouTube on Saturday with a joyous announcement – the happy couple is '15 weeks along, and counting' as they expect their first child</p>

<p>Muniz, who is also a former race car driver, starts off by describing the adventures he and Paige have experienced over the past four and a half years, as they traveled the world.  </p>

<p>'But nothing quite compares to  the first time hearing your little one’s heart beat,' the Stay Alive actor said.</p>

<p>Frankie went on to say it was something of a 'miracle,' and that 'when reality set in,' he began 'throwing out baby names and future career choices.'</p>

<p>Busting weird moves: The actor, 34, and his 27-year-old bride began the video with some awkward dance moves that are peppered throughout the clip</p>

<p>Paige, for her part, talked about how the parents-to-be were in 'a state of disbelief' upon learning the news of the pregnancy, going on to touch upon some health concerns.</p>

<p>'We knew that we wanted this,' she said in the video, 'but we were told that our chances weren’t that great.</p>

<p>'The struggle of going to every doctor's appointment made me feel less and less like a woman,' she continued. </p>

<p>Parents-to-be: Frankie and Paige both reflect on the baby news in voice overs in the sweet snippet on YouTube</p>

<p>While it wasn't clear what the reason was for their perceived difficulties conceiving, the problem presumably could stem from Frankie's health problems as a result of multiple race car driving accidents. </p>

<p>Regardless, Paige went on: 'I'm excited to say that we beat the odds and we’re officially 15 weeks along and counting!'</p>

<p>The video continued to show the loving pair embracing and rejoicing, and holding up a picture of the first sonogram.</p>
