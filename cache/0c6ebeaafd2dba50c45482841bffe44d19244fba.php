<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andy Robertson sent a selfie of him wearing a Chelsea shirt to the Liverpool players' WhatsApp group before the Reds were crowned champions.</p>

<p>The left back decided to wind up his team-mates ahead of Chelsea's match against Manchester City - with Jurgen Klopp's team knowing a victory or draw for Frank Lampard's side would hand them the title.</p>

<p>The Liverpool players had all gathered at the luxury Formby Hall to watch the game with Robertson taking the shirt Billy Gilmour had given him after their FA Cup clash in March - much to the dismay of the rest of the squad. </p>

<p>Andy Robertson revealed how he sent a selfie of him wearing a Chelsea top to his team-mates</p>

<p>The left back swapped shirts with his fellow Scot Billy Gilmour after the FA Cup tie in March</p>

<p>When the 26-year-old sent a picture of him donning the London side's kit, he received a series of abusive messages and emojis - just the reaction he had been hoping for.</p>

<p>'What should you wear if you are a Liverpool player preparing for what could turn out to be the greatest day of your football career so far? Easy – a Chelsea shirt,' writes Robertson in his new book. </p>

<p>'As the rest of the lads were getting ready for a barbecue that we all hoped would turn into a title winners party, I went into my wardrobe and pulled out the shirt that Billy Gilmour had given me a few months earlier.</p>

<p>Chelsea's 2-1 victory over Manchester City handed the Reds the title after a 30-year wait</p>

<p>Robertson's new book, Robbo: Now You're Gonna Believe Us tells the story of the club's season</p>

<p>'Putting it on, it felt a bit snug but I was going for the colour, not the fit. A quick selfie followed and I posted the picture on our group chat straight away.</p>

<p>'"Lads, what’s the dress code for tonight?" I asked and a series of uncomplimentary responses and emojis sent my phone into overdrive. "Shorts and t-shirt it is then," I thought."</p>

<p>'Not that I’d been serious anyway. I just wanted to give the lads the chance to have a pop but there was no doubt that for one night and one night only, everyone of a Liverpool persuasion would be supporting Chelsea. All they needed was a draw and we would be champions.'</p>

<p>The Scotland captain's book, Robbo: Now You're Gonna Believe Us,  details the Reds' road to glory and the defender revealed how he felt certain their title victory would come that night. </p>

<p>'By this point it was only a matter of time anyway. Even if City won at Stamford Bridge, it was still a question of when rather than if we would finish the job,' he writes.</p>

<p>The Scotland captain said he felt certain their title victory would be confirmed that night</p>

<p>'But having waited for thirty years to win the league, no-one associated with Liverpool wanted the delay to go on any longer.</p>

<p>'Yes, we were in a luxury position and if all we had taken from the night was some decent food and drink, none of us would have complained but when a trophy is so close that you can almost reach out and touch it, you just want someone to thrust it into your arms.</p>

<p>'I didn’t say this to anyone else, but I was in no doubt that this would be the night. It felt fated and it felt that way from the moment we came off the pitch after beating Palace.' </p>
