<p>America's oldest WWII veteran Lawrence Brooks at a socially distanced 111th birthday party held at his home in New Orleans, Louisiana, due to the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p> Mr Brooks was treated to a full military flypast over his home and watched an aerobatics show by the Aeroshell Aerobatic Team and The Big Easy Wing</p>

<p>Mr Brooks was born in 1909 and received around 10,000 birthday cards thanks to a public campaign </p>

<p>Mr Brooks was born in 1909 and served in the 91st Engineer Battalion in New Guinea and the Philippines from 1940 to 1945.</p>

<p>He was drafted at 31 years of age and served at a time when the military was still segregated, eventually reaching the rank of Private First Class.</p>

<p>The National World War II Museum's Amber Mitchell said: 'It is such an honor to have the oldest living U.S. veteran of World War II living so close to our institution. </p>

<p>'And it was meaningful for us to continue to celebrate Lawrence Brooks and his incredible life in a safe manner this year.</p>

<p>The birthday celebrations were organised by The National WWII Museum in New Orleans on Saturday</p>

<p>'As we continue to lose members of The Greatest Generation, it is so important that we honor these men and women for their bravery and sacrifice while they are with us,' she told Fox 8 New Orleans.</p>

<p>The museum has organised Mr Brooks's birthday celebrations for the last five years, including a special 110th party last year. </p>

<p>After his service, Brooks worked as a forklift operator and retired in his 70s. He has five children, 13 grandchildren, and 22 great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>The museum told Insider: 'There was a private celebration. The Victory Belles trio sang to him and there were two military flyovers.</p>

<p>'Everything was socially distanced and Mr. Brooks was on his porch. We did get close to 10,000 cards.</p>

<p>'There was at least one card from every state and there were cards from seven different countries.'</p>

<p>Mr Brooks was born as one of 15 children in Norwood, Louisiana, and moved to New Orleans as a young man, working in a laundry and a parking garage before being drafted in the army.</p>

<p>He served a mandatory one-year term in the 91st Engineer Battalion, which was primarily responsible for building infrastructure, and was re-enlisted a month after leaving to help the US efforts in World War II.</p>

<p>He then spent 48 days on the Queen Mary, traveling from New York to Australia, in 1942, which had to zigzag through both the Atlantic and the Pacific in an effort to avoid German U-boats and Japanese submarines. </p>

<p>At the time, the 91st was used more for physical labor than soldiering, leading to Brooks acting as an orderly for three white officers, driving them around, getting their meals and cleaning their uniforms, among other tasks.   </p>

<p>'They just sort of took a liking to me,' Brooks said of the officers. 'They treated me like a soldier and not their servant.'</p>

<p>Despite not having to brandish a gun while serving, Brooks still faced life-threatening situations. </p>

<p>The National World War II Museum's Amber Mitchell said: 'It is such an honor to have the oldest living U.S. veteran of World War II living so close to our institution'</p>

<p>In New Guinea, an incendiary bomb destroyed the tent that he lived in with seven other soldiers. Fortunately, they were out watching a movie at the time. </p>

<p>And, during a return flight from Australia, he found himself helping to dump bails of barbed wire overboard in an effort to lighten the aircraft's load when an engine cut out. </p>

<p>In an oral history interview with the museum, Brooks said: 'There was the pilot, the co-pilot and me and just two parachutes. </p>

<p>'I told them, "If we have to jump, I’m going to grab one of them."' </p>
