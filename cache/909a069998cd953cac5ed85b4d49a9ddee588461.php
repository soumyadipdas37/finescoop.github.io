<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A multitasking father-of-three duct taped his baby's seat to the top of his robot vacuum so he could entertain his daughter and clean the house at the same time.</p>

<p>Daniel Bedenbaugh decided to keep his six-month-old daughter Lucy at home in South Carolina when she came down with a runny nose on September 22.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old father was working in sales from home and had to juggle his job with entertaining his youngest daughter and cleaning the house.</p>

<p>But Mr Bedenbaugh had a genius idea when he noticed that their Roomba vacuum was around the same size as the base of Lucy's seat.</p>

<p>The inventive father found a couple of feet of silver duct tape in his garage and went about wrapping it around the base of the seat and underneath the mechanical floor cleaner.</p>

<p>Hilarious video footage shows Lucy riding around on top of the DIY robot chair while her cheerful father sings Roger Miller's 'King of the Road' to her.</p>

<p>Daniel Bedenbaugh, 30, duct taped his daughter Lucy's chair to a Roomba vacuum to do the cleaning while entertaining his six-month-old girl, a video from September 22 shows</p>

<p>The father (right), who also shares four-year-old Charlie (centre left) and Jojo (centre), three, with his wife Cara (left), came up with the hack while working from home in South Carolina</p>

<p>The little girl spins around in small circles while the Roomba vacuum is set up to clean the floors of the family home, the video shows.</p>

<p>When his youngest was securely fastened into her DIY chair, Mr Bedenbaugh sent the adorable footage to his 30-year-old wife and schoolteacher Cara.</p>

<p>The married couple also share two older daughters, four-year-old Charlie and Jojo, three.</p>

<p>Mrs Bedenbaugh vowed never to leave the pair alone together again, until she spotted the tape and realised that her husband had 'attempted to make it safe'.</p>

<p>After her initial fears, the mother shared the video to social media where friends branded the idea 'genius' while others said it's something their own husband would do.</p>

<p>Daniel said: 'Cara told me she thought to herself "I shouldn't leave those two alone together" until she noticed the tape and decided I was at least attempting to make it safe.</p>

<p>'I was attempting to clean the house while entertaining Lucy, while working, when I realised the base of her seat was about the size of the top of the Roomba.</p>

<p>'In about five minutes, with a couple feet of duct tape, I had the seat secured to the hoover for a trial run.</p>

<p>'She rode around the room for about 15 minutes and was a little apprehensive at first because the Roomba only has one speed which is a little bit faster than ideal for baby transportation.</p>

<p>Mrs Bedenbaugh shared her husband's unusual childcare technique on Facebook where friends branded it as 'genius'. Above, Lucy (right) with her sisters Charlie and Jojo (centre)</p>

<p>Mrs Bedenbaugh, 30, (right) vowed not to leave her husband alone with Lucy after watching the footage - before spotting the tape and realising he had 'attempted to make it safe'</p>

<p>'But it didn't take long for her to embrace the experience and she fully enjoyed her new ride.</p>

<p>'When I showed my boss, he told me I have too much time on my hands. A few friends have joked I should patent the idea.'</p>

<p>Other friends who watched the video said the hack was so good that they suggested the father should patent the idea.</p>

<p>Another person commented that Mr Bedenbaugh seemed to be starting his daughter on household chores a little 'early' on. </p>

<p>One friend said: 'Maybe he ought to patent one of those.'</p>

<p>Another person commented: 'She is having a blast. Fyi...my husband would have done this too (if we had one when they were that small).' </p>
