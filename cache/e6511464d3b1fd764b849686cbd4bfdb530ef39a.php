<p>Seen on Instagram in his new film Waiting For The Barbarians: These posts come as Depp received word Friday from a Virginia court that there will indeed be a delay in the new defamation trial he is bringing against ex Amber Heard</p>

<p>Depp had initially filed a motion on August 21 to have the upcoming $50M defamation trial delayed so he could begin filming Fantastic Beasts 3 in London.</p>

<p>The Cry Baby actor filed court documents in a Fairfax County, Virginia court requesting the trial be delayed until anywhere between March and June of 2021, once filming was completed.</p>

<p>His ex Amber, 34, in turn filed a motion opposing the request. </p>

<p>The court had initially set the trial to run from January 11, 2021 to January 28, 2021, though Warner Bros. recently revealed they plan to start filming Fantastic Beasts 3 in October in London, which will run through the end of February.</p>
