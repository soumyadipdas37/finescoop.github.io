<p>And Jackie 'O' Henderson has now revealed she finds women physically more attractive than men. </p>

<p>'I just find women, overall, more attractive': Jackie 'O' Henderson, 45, revealed on Wednesday's Kyle And Jackie O Show that she finds women physically more attractive than men</p>

<p>'I would say, a girl's thing hanging out versus a guy's thing hanging out, is much more attractive,' she told co-host Kyle Sandilands and newsreader Brooklyn Ross. </p>

<p>Stating her case, Jackie insisted: 'You know, ours is just a teeny tiny little bit, [while] yours is like a big ball that's hanging out - hairy and veiny.'    </p>

<p>Brooklyn joked that Jackie may be coming to a mid-life realisation about her sexual preference. </p>

<p>'A girl's thing hanging out versus a guy's thing hanging out, is much more attractive': Jackie made the surprising confession during a discussion about female genitalia.</p>

<p>'You sound more and more like a lesbian every day, Jackie,' Brooklyn laughed, prompting Jackie to admit she's 'actually worried about herself'.   </p>

<p>Fascinated, Kyle queried whether Jackie thinks about women while 'pleasuring herself'.   </p>

<p>'No, that's where I know I'm not [a lesbian],' the blonde reasoned.   </p>

<p>Explicit: Fascinated, Kyle (pictured) queried whether Jackie thinks about women while 'pleasuring herself'</p>

<p>'When I think about sex I think about a guy. But for some reason I just find women, overall, more attractive,' the mother-of-one said. </p>

<p>While heterosexual Kyle naturally agreed with the sentiment, Brooklyn - who is openly gay - had other ideas. </p>

<p>'A guy with a 6-pack, don't you think that's hot?' Brooklyn insisted. </p>

<p>Jackie responded: 'If you were looking at the perfect man, like naked, and the perfect woman naked, I'd be drawn to the woman.'</p>

<p>In 2017, Jackie famously confessed on-air that she'd dreamed about a sexual encounter with a woman who resembled Megan Markle. </p>

<p>Divulging the 'vivid' details, Jackie said: 'I'm on my back and I am nude and she's on top of me.'  </p>

<p>No doubt: Jackie responded: 'If you were looking at the perfect man, like naked, and the perfect woman naked, I'd be drawn to the woman'</p>

<p>'She was wearing a little white lacy g-string and was on all fours. I'm kissing her bottom and [Bruno Bouchet, a KIIS FM colleague] was there watching,' she added. </p>

<p>Jackie announced her split from husband-of-14-years Lee Henderson in October 2018. </p>

<p>The couple share custody of nine-year-old daughter, Catalina 'Kitty' Mae Henderson.</p>
