<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A destructive possum was adopted by a Victorian family after they bought an $8 Kmart item to stop the marsupial from wrecking their garage. </p>

<p>Leisa Embury Collins, from Belgrave, east of Melbourne, said the possum, named Pandy, had been climbing into the garage and pushing over paint cans since May. </p>

<p>She said the animal looked extremely sad when he sat on the shelves so her mother told her to find him a box to live in before the family bought a cat cave from Kmart for $8. </p>

<p>'We decided to go one better and buy him the Kmart cat cave,' she told news.com.au.</p>

<p>'We never really thought he’d use it but three-and-a-half hours later he was in it.'</p>

<p>A Victorian family bought a Kmart cat bed for a possum (pictured) they found destroying paint cans in their garage before the marsupial decided to make it his new home</p>

<p>While Pandy was somewhat of a pet to the family Mrs Collins said he was still a wild animal that came and went as he pleased. </p>

<p>She created a Facebook page, Pandycam 2020, so other people could enjoy the possum's garage adventures.</p>

<p>Some users pointed out how much happier he looked in the cat bed compared to when he was on the cold garage shelf. </p>

<p>'Naw that first pic, Pandy is so lucky to have found you,' one user wrote.</p>

<p>'You are a wonderful human being. Seeing Pandy so comfy warms my heart,' another added. </p>

<p>'He is almost smiling,' a third Facebook user pointed out.   </p>

<p>Leisa Embury Collins, from Belgrave, east of Melbourne said she bought the cat bed for the possum, named Pandy, because he looked so miserable hiding in their garage (pictured)</p>
