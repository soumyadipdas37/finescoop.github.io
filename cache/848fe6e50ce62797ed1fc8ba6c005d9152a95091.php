<p>To which the trio revealed they had similar problems during their virtual lockdown quizzes, to which the comedian revealed he was shocked he finished so low down.</p>

<p>He said: 'I absolutely loved those quizzes until I came... actually rock bottom in them. It was quite, we were all so sad anyway underneath, but that was quite a blow actually! Can we name names?'</p>

<p>To which Holly replied: 'Yeah, I think so...'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Michael's appearance comes after he revealed that a joke about handwashing had been taken out of his Netflix special amid the coronavirus pandemic. He recorded the show in March ahead of the lockdown.  </p>

<p>The comedian told Jessie Ware on her podcast Table Manners: 'I did a joke about it [coronavirus]. I introduced myself on stage when all the handwashing stuff was starting.</p>

<p>'I said, 'Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together and wash them for 30 seconds as we welcome Michael McIntyre.' </p>

<p>'I actually came on and said, 'This could be the last time we get together in a crowd.' I said it as a joke, I should never have said that.'</p>

<p>Asked if it remained, he said: 'No, I took all that stuff out. There are a few more jokes in the Netflix special which I'm hoping are still funny but it's worried me slightly. </p>

<p>'I have jokes about face masks, but this was at a time no one in the world except people in Asia were wearing face masks.' </p>

<p>This Morning continues on weekdays at 10am on ITV.  </p>
