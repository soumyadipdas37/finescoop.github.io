<p>Wow: Gordon Ramsay showed off the breathtaking views from the new pool he's had installed at his Cornwall holiday home over the bank holiday weekend</p>

<p>Holiday home: As well as enjoying the new addition to his home, Gordon was seen taking a family walk on Monday morning with his family</p>

<p>Starting the video with a shot of the pool's water with the caption 'wow', Gordon panned the camera up to show off the landscaped garden which led down to the beach.</p>

<p>'Porthilly beach which has some of the most delicious oysters and mussels anywhere in the world,' he narrated. </p>

<p>'Simply stunning. How could you not love Cornwall?' he gushed, taking in the blue skies.</p>

<p>Wow! Gordon first shared a glimpse of his incredible new swimming pool at his £4.4million holiday home in an Instagram snap last week</p>

<p>Gordon, 53, took to Instagram last week to share a snap of the pool with a transparent wall, which can cost up to £50,000,  after demolishing the original five-bedroom mansion on the site to build two new properties there. </p>

<p>Gordon has faced complaints from locals for demolishing his 1920's clifftop home to build two new homes, with neighbours accusing him of bringing 'Legoland to Cornwall.'</p>

<p>Posting the snap, Gordon, posing with his youngest son Oscar, 15 months, penned the caption: 'Off for an evening walk with <?php echo e('@'); ?>oscarjramsay.' </p>

<p>This is the life: 'Now that is what I call a August bank holiday, look at that, beautiful,' he captioned Sunday's video, as the family spent the long weekend at their beach retreat</p>

<p>Grand: The TV chef shared a snap of the lavish new pool with a transparent wall, which is in the new Cornish home he's been building (pictured) after demolishing the original five-bedroom property</p>

<p>One of the swimming pool's unique selling points comes from its transparent wall overlooking the stunning Celtic sea.</p>

<p>In a snap of Gordon's sprawling new Cornish property, which underwent renovations earlier this year, the pool can be seen in the centre of the outside area. </p>

<p>As well as enjoying the new addition to his home, Gordon was seen taking a family walk on Monday morning with his family. </p>

<p>The fiery chef was accompanied by wife Tana, 45, and three of their five children - Jack, 20, Matilda, 18, and Oscar - during a brisk  morning walk across the sand. </p>

<p>Gordon has faced backlash from locals for demolishing the original five-bedroom property that had been on the site in Rock, Cornwall, which he bought for £4.4 million in 2015. </p>

<p>At the time, it was the second most expensive sale ever recorded in Cornwall and infuriated local residents.</p>

<p>The TV chef, originally from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, was granted planning permission by Cornwall Council to replace the 1920s property with a main house and a smaller second property, known as 'The Garden House'.</p>

<p>Beach day: The fiery chef was accompanied by wife Tana, 45, and three of their five children - Jack, 20, Matilda, 18, and Oscar - during a brisk morning walk across the sand</p>

<p>Exercise: Tama carried their toddler Oscar in a baby carrier on her back as they enjoyed the morning sun</p>

<p>Favourite spot: The family have spent the long weekend in Cornwall after returning to London after lockdown ended</p>

<p>The new house, has two kitchens, a swimming pool, a wine cellar and four en suite bathrooms, around 100 yards from the beach. Gordon was also given the green light to construct a three-bedroom grass-covered boathouse just a stone's throw from water at high tide. </p>

<p>Nearly 20 people wrote to Cornwall Council to complain that the Garden House, about 25 metres from the shore, would spoil the designated area of outstanding natural beauty and damage other residents' view.</p>

<p>The three-bedroom grass-covered Garden House, which also has a boat store, is being built just a stone's throw from water at high tide.</p>

<p>Councillors gave the application the thumbs up on the basis that other properties were not overlooked.</p>

<p>At the time, a spokesman for Ramsay tried to diffuse the row saying: 'Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall.</p>

<p>Close: Gordon chatted animatedly with Tana, with the parents matching in workout gear</p>

<p>Happy: The fiery chef shared a clip of the views from the morning walk on the beach</p>

<p>Gordon Ramsay has splashed out on a lavish 'open top' swimming pool for his £4.4 million home in Cornwall</p>

<p>The outdoor pool stretches to at least 15 feet in length, and features a completely transparent wall overlooking the Celtic Sea</p>

<p>Pools with so-called fiberglass walls, or 'open top windows' are a costly venture, with prices reaching up to £50,000</p>

<p>Costs can vary depending on the sizes required for the pool, with most companies offering prices on an ad hoc basis</p>

<p>'They are committed to contributing to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be a part of for many years.' </p>

<p>Other neighbours have also defended the Ramsays, stating that objectors simply did so because of the name, and that several old houses along Rock Road have already been demolished.</p>

<p>Gordon angered locals after relocating to his second home in Cornwall during the coronavirus crisis despite the Government urging Britons not to travel.</p>

<p>The star - who has since returned to London - was spotted a number of times taking long excursions when outings were still limited to an hour a day including a beachside stroll with his entire family. </p>

<p>The Hell's Kitchen star also landed in hot water with the local coastguard, who are said to have issued an official warning to him over his apparent flouting of lockdown guidelines.</p>

<p>Sources indicated that Gordon was seen in Rock, Fowey, Port Isaac and Newquay – some distance from his £4 million home in Trebetherick.</p>

<p>The warning is particularly troubling because Ramsay was the face of a 'Stayhome' initiative on YouTube which he had been plugging on his ten-minute cookery shows, filmed in 'isolation' in his Cornwall kitchen.  </p>

<p>Splashing out: Pictured is the old house before it was demolished. At the time Ramsay bought the property, it was the second most expensive sale ever recorded in Cornwall</p>
