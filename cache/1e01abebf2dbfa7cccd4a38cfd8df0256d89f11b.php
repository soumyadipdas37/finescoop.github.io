<p>A volleyball coach at an elite private college proposed to his 15-year-old student only four months after they started a secret affair, a court has heard (stock image)</p>

<p>The 38-year-old was sentenced to a maximum of six years' jail after appearing at the Brisbane District Court on Friday, reported the Courier Mail. </p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to 28 charges including indecent treatment of a child under 16, maintaining an unlawful relationship with a child and making child exploitation materials.</p>

<p>He was also sentenced over supplying liquor to a minor and stalking.</p>

<p>The court heard the volleyball coach was still engaged to another woman in the United States when he began the unlawful relationship. </p>

<p>After asking the teenager's mother if he could spend more time with the girl he pursued her on and off the school grounds for a number of months. </p>

<p>This was despite the mother telling him it was highly inappropriate. </p>

<p>But the pair were caught by another student in November 2018, who alerted the college.</p>

<p>The court heard the school removed him from the faculty and contacted Queensland Police.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old was sentenced to a maximum of six years' jail after appearing at the Brisbane District Court (pictured) on Friday </p>

<p>'The school responded immediately and the defendant was suspended from the school,' Prosecutor Sandra Cupina said. </p>

<p>But when the coach was contacted he told police the relationship was 'purely platonic'.</p>

<p>He then flew over to the United States to be with his fiancee, but not before taking his victim to a hotel and proposing to her the night before his flight.</p>

<p>Months later his partner in the US uncovered a series of photos of Burtt with the teenager on a USB. </p>

<p>Defence barrister Kate Juhasz said the sports coach offered a 'very low risk' of reoffending and described Burtt's remorse over his actions. </p>

<p>Justice David Jackson said the sports coach had abused his position of power to take advantage of the minor. </p>

<p>Burtt will be eligible for parole in September 2022.</p>

<p>The volleyball coach grew up around Bundaberg Queensland, even running as a Labor candidate for the seat of Maryborough in the 2012 state election.</p>

<p>Any trace of the coach's connection to the political party have since been removed from the ALP website.   </p>
