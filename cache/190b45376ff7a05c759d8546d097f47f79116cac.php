<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Carlo Ancelotti prowled around with his hands stuffed in his pockets, occasionally looking to his assistants to express his irritation.</p>

<p>Everton’s manager is not a dreamer and there were times on a dank night in Fleetwood when he gave the impression that things were going wrong. He scowled when there were unnecessary back passes and scolded Jordan Pickford for silly errors.</p>

<p>Watching Ancelotti at Highbury was fascinating, simply because his team were relatively so assured. Everton have had a horrible habit of making these kind of cup ties difficult but, with the exception of an uncomfortable 10 minutes, this was as straightforward as you could imagine.</p>

<p>Richarlison struck a brace as Everton beat Fleetwood in a six-goal thriller Carabao Cup tie</p>

<p>The Brazilian striker scored a header and a thunderbolt as the Toffees dominated the first half</p>

<p>This has been an encouraging start to the season for Everton and, thanks to the slick efforts of his Brazilians Richarlison and Bernard, they are now into the Carabao Cup fourth round; their intentions could not be clearer.</p>

<p>Joey Barton was right to expect no James Rodriguez in Everton’s starting line-up but a few other names would have taken him by surprise; Ancelotti went strong from the start, an indication of how seriously he is taking this competition, and he was rewarded with an exemplary performance.</p>

<p>Fleetwood had plenty of spirit and energy and were well organised but Everton, for long periods, had those in red-and-white playing piggy-in-the-middle such was the accuracy and cohesion of their passing. The ball zipped from left to right and the hosts couldn’t get near them.</p>

<p>A measure of Everton’s dominance in the opening 45 minutes was reflected in the fact that Fleetwood’s best attacking moment was a corner from the left that was comfortably headed away. Quite simply, they couldn’t get anywhere close to doing damage.</p>

<p>Everton, by contrast, looked capable of breaking through at any given moment and their first goal arrived in the 23rd minute when Richarlison slid in at the back post to finish Bernard’s cross following good work by Alex Iwobi.</p>

<p>Alex Iwobi was quick to answer Mark Duffy's early second half strike with an instant reply</p>

<p>Fleetwood's Callum Camps scored acrobatically as the hosts staged an impressive fightback</p>

<p>Iwobi has bitterly disappointed in the last 12 months but Ancelotti would have been impressed with his attitude here and the former Arsenal man was involved in the game deciding second goal in the 35th minute, his deft back heel giving Richarlison the opportunity to thrash in from 14 yards.</p>

<p>While Everton’s substitutes bellowed their delight, with Seamus Coleman particularly vociferous, Ancelotti simply stood with hands in his pockets and munched his way through a packet of chewing gum. He was a picture of serenity but had no intention of getting ahead of himself.</p>

<p>With good reason. Everton were sloppy after the restart and gave a silly goal to substitute Mark Duffy but soon Iwobi restored their two-goal. Fleetwood refused to go away and Callum Camps’ fantastic overhead kick in the 58th minute fired hope of a penalty shootout.</p>

<p>It was not to be, though, as Everton kept moving the ball and eventually Bernard thrashed in from 12 yards to settle things. </p>

<p>The rout was completed in injury time when the excellent Niels Nkounkou skipped down the left and crossed for substitute Moise Kean to fire in from close range. Only then did Ancelotti allow himself a smile. </p>

<p>Fleetwood XI: Cairns, Andrew, Whelan, Burns, Evans (Saunders 76'), Morris, Camps, Coutts (Matete 75'), Boyes, Stubbs (Duffy 46'), Hill.</p>
