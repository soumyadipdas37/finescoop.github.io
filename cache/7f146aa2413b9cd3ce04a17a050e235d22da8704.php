<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Locky Gilbert's season of The Bachelor is still under way, but the franchise is already looking for its next leading man. </p>

<p>A glimpse at the show's application form reveals that budding Bachelors need to be 27 to 40 years old, and must also pass a strict vetting process.</p>

<p>Producers are looking for a squeaky-clean everyman this time around, so candidates are being thoroughly screened with some very personal questions.</p>

<p>'Do you have any sex tapes?' The outrageous questions on The Bachelor application form have been revealed. Pictured: this year's Bachelor, Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>Speak now or forever hold your nudes! One question asks if the applicant has 'skeletons in their closet' in the form of sex tapes, explicit photos or jilted lovers</p>

<p>'Do you have any skeletons in your closet, e.g. jilted lovers, sex tapes, sexually explicit photos of you that have been distributed or disseminated without your permission?' one of the questions asks.</p>

<p>This query would likely rule out the swathe of influencers who have been selling nudes on OnlyFans to make money during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Next, the online form asks for the applicant's current relationship status. If they are still in a relationship, they must provide details.</p>

<p>It ain't easy landing the dream job! A glimpse at the show's application form reveals that budding Bachelors need to be 27 to 40 years old, and must also pass a strict vetting process</p>

<p>'How many sexual partners have you had? Male? Female?' one question states, while another asks 'if there is anything you regret doing in your past relationships'.</p>

<p>Would-be Bachelors also have to provide links to their Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat accounts - presumably so that producers can have a good stalk.</p>

<p>The application form includes several questions about mental health, asking if the candidate is seeing a psychiatrist or psychologist, or currently taking medication. </p>

<p>Don't be a Honey Badger? The application form tries to make sure men are on the show for the right reasons, after Nick Cummins (pictured) infamously picked no one</p>

<p>It also asks about cultural background, age, weight, height, weight and even clothing sizes, as well as how you would describe yourself and your 'ideal partner'. </p>

<p>Aspiring suitors also need to provide two recent photos and 'a short video telling us about the wildest thing you have done for love or in your life'. </p>

<p>Lastly, the form asks if you have been 'arrested, charged or convicted of a criminal offence' and, if so, to provide details of the crime.</p>

<p>Do you have what it takes? Locky's season of The Bachelor is still under way, but the show is already looking for its next leading man</p>
