<p>They may have been dating for less than a year, but Nicole and Thom are clearly devoted to one another and divide their time between her LA pad and London. </p>

<p>According to reports, Nicole is trying for a baby with her former rugby player beau.</p>

<p>The singer is said to be keen to start a family of her own with Thom, as the couple are looking to the future and intend on purchasing a property together in London.</p>

<p>A friend told The Sun: 'Thom told pals he's been taking supplements to boost fertility. Nicole and Thom are ridiculously loved-up, and have had serious conversations about everything from marriage to babies.</p>

<p>'No one would be surprised if they had some baby news in the coming months.</p>

<p>'Thom currently lives with his brother and a housemate in London which hardly makes for a romantic love nest. They are looking to buy a house together once lockdown is over.'</p>

<p>Nicole's representatives declined to comment and MailOnline also contacted Thom's representatives who are yet to comment. </p>
