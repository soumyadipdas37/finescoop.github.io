<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Woolworths will launch Disney Plus Ooshies in Victoria for the first time this week, after the release was delayed during the state's Stage Four lockdown. </p>

<p>From Wednesday, Victorian shoppers can collect one of the 36 iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar with every $30 spent in store or online.</p>

<p>The collectables were launched across Australia on August 26 but the supermarket chain delayed the roll out in Victoria to allow employees to focus on store operations and the safety of customers as the state adjusted to the strict restrictions.</p>

<p>Woolworths will launch Disney Plus Ooshies in Victoria for the first time this week, after the release was delayed during the state's Stage Four lockdown </p>

<p>'We know many of our customers in Victoria have been waiting patiently for the arrival of Ooshies and we're thrilled to introduce them across the state from this Wednesday,' Woolworths chief marketing officer Andrew Hicks said.</p>

<p>'Victorians have had an incredibly challenging year and we hope this collection helps bring some well deserved excitement and magic to their shop.</p>

<p>'I also want to thank our Victorian customers for their patience and understanding with the delay. </p>

<p>'The safety of our customers and team members is our number one priority through COVID-19. The delay in launching Disney+ Ooshies in the state allowed us to keep our focus on customer safety as the community adjusted to lockdown. </p>

<p>'We now believe we are in a better position to continue to prioritise keeping customers and team safe, while also launching the campaign.'</p>

<p>From Wednesday, residents in Victoria can collect one of the 36 iconic characters from Marvel, Star Wars, Disney and Pixar with every $30 spent in store or online</p>

<p>Shoppers in Victoria can now collect fan favourites such as Elsa from Frozen, Captain Marvel, Woody from Toy Story and Stormtrooper from Star Wars. </p>

<p>The collection includes silver, gold, colour changing, glow in the dark, additional glitter editions, and ultra rare furry Thor and Baby Yoda Ooshies.</p>

<p>Through a partnership with TerraCycle, every store also has dedicated recycling bins so customers can drop any pre-loved Ooshies (including last year's Lion King Ooshies) and wrapper to be recycled, until January 31. </p>

<p>The paper wrapper can also be recycled at home in the paper and cardboard recycling bin. The Ooshies are then turned into plastic pellets, used to help make outdoor products such as park benches.</p>

<p>The new Ooshie collection in Victoria will run six weeks or while supplies last. </p>
