<p>The 11,947-ton Australian-owned Gulf Livestock One was carrying 43 crew and 5,800 cows when it got into trouble on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The vessel left New Zealand on August 14 and was due into the Port of Jingtang in Tangshan, China, today. </p>

<p>As the vessel headed across the East China Sea it began to flounder and the crew battled to keep it afloat.</p>

<p>Seawater invaded the interior of the Gulf Livestock One and ran over the electrics and machinery during its final few hours.</p>

<p>Flooding water made conditions slippery underfoot as the crew, of 39 from the Philippines, two from New Zealand and two from Australia, fought in vain to save the doomed ship.</p>

<p>Typhoon Maysak was blowing by southern Japan when the ship sank. The ship's instruments showed that it was sailing into high winds of 56 knots or 66 miles an hour. </p>

<p>The captain of Gulf Livestock One sent a distress call to the Japanese Coast Guard at about 1.20am on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Rescuers in an aircraft and four boats plus divers searched for survivors. They found a bundle of orange rope and a life jacket with the ship's name on.</p>

<p>Then on Friday the search teams found a body and multiple dead cows in the waters near where the ship sank.</p>

<p>This man was found unconscious and face down in the water about 75 miles north west of the island of Amami Oshima.</p>

<p>No details of the man's nationality or crew status have been released but he was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead, said Takahiro Yamada, a senior spokesman for the regional coast guard headquarters.</p>

<p>An Australian veterinarian is still thought to be among 42 crew still missing from the capsized ship.</p>

<p>Lukas Orda, 25, from the Gold Coast, was on board Australian-owned Gulf Livestock 1 when the captain sent a distress call to the Japanese Coast Guard at about 1.20am on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr Orda and his wife Emma welcomed their first child, Theo, six months ago.</p>

<p>He moved to Queensland from Germany as a child before taking up studies at James Cook University after attending high school in Mount Isa.</p>

<p>Mr Orda was working with horses on the Gold Coast before joining the live export carrier as a vet in June, the Townsville Bulletin reported. </p>

<p>Japan's coast guard dispatched planes and rescue boats to hunt for the ship and late Wednesday found a sole survivor, Sareno Edvarodo, the ship's 45-year-old Filipino chief officer.</p>

<p>Dramatic photos released by the coast guard showed Edvarodo floating in the darkness in an orange life jacket and being pulled onto a boat with a rope as rescuers battled violent, rolling waves.</p>

<p>He was quickly brought to a large vessel, where coast guard personnel with surgical masks and gloves wrapped him with blankets. </p>

<p>He told rescuers: 'Thank you, thank you very much. I'm the only one? No other one?” he asked the rescuers, then added, “I'm so sorry ... (I'm) so lucky,' said Fox News. </p>
