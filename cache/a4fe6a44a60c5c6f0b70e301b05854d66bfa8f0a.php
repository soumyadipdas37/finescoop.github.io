<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tony Mokbel may not have received a fair trial when he was sentenced to prison on drug trafficking charges because of his lawyer's double life as a police informer.</p>

<p>The head of an inquiry into the Lawyer X scandal, which saw a high-profile lawyer double as an informant, made the conclusions in a 2,000-page report which was released on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mokbel had a professional relationship with lawyer Nicola Gobbo from early 2002, and he believed their conversations were subject to legal privilege.   </p>

<p>'It was submitted that Ms Gobbo failed to disclose to Mr Mokbel her personal relationships with witnesses (both civilian witnesses and police officers),' the submission read.</p>

<p>'It was submitted that the circumstances in which Mr Mokbel was convicted of each charge gave rise to a substantial miscarriage of justice.'</p>

<p>Nicola Gobbo and drug lord Tony Mokbel were once close. She had acted as his lawyer but doubled as a police informant</p>

<p>Counsel assisting argued Victoria Police had an obligation to offer Mokbel a right to a fair trial, which included informing him or the court that his lawyer was a 'human source' in the investigation, Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>During the inquiry, Commissioner Margaret McMurdo received recommendations that both Gobbo and Victoria Police should be the subjects of a criminal investigation.   </p>

<p>Submissions by Chris Winneke QC, counsel assisting the royal commission into Ms Gobbo's informing, were released on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>'The submissions included contentions that I should find various named current and former Victoria Police officers and Ms Nicola Gobbo may have committed criminal offences,' Ms McMurdo said.</p>

<p>'I decided not to make findings in my final report, which will be publicly available, that any named individuals may have committed criminal offences.'</p>

<p>Tony Mokbel was stabbed almost to death inside jail. He hopes that he will soon be let free due to the meddling of his then lawyer Nicola Gobbo</p>

<p>Nicola Gobbo, who went into hiding, acted as a police informant while representing some of Victoria's hardened criminals</p>

<p>The documents also include separate submissions from Victoria Police, former chief commissioners Simon Overland and Graham Ashton, Ms Gobbo and drug kingpin Mokbel. </p>

<p>But the sections naming individuals who may have committed criminal offences or breached Victoria Police legislation will be blacked out.</p>

<p>Ms McMurdo said a decision around criminal charges was for Victoria's Director of Public Prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC.</p>

<p>Public discussion could unfairly prejudice future trials and the contentions made in submissions 'will be detrimental to the reputations of those named', she said.</p>

<p>Ms Gobbo was registered as an informer three times, her longest stint between 2005-09 when she helped police bring down a number of her former clients, including Mokbel and killer Carl Williams.</p>

<p>Mokbel is one of nearly a dozen people currently appealing convictions they claim were tainted by Ms Gobbo's informing.</p>

<p>Mokbel spent 15 months on the run after fleeing his 2006 drug trial, in which more than 15 million pills hidden in tomato cans from Italy</p>

<p>Evidence suggests both federal and state prosecution agencies knew Ms Gobbo was working as an informer during the trafficking case.  </p>

<p>Zlate Cvetanovski was freed on bail while he awaits his appeal, after spending almost a decade in jail, while Faruk Orman had his murder conviction quashed by Victoria's Court of Appeal last year.</p>

<p>Victoria Police sensationally apologised for the gangland barrister's involvement as a police informant, and said steps had been taken to ensure it could 'never happen again'.  </p>

<p>'It was an indefensible interference in the lawyer/client relationship, a relationship that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system and to the rule of law,' a police spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>'Our failure at that time to ensure that these circumstances were identified and disclosed was also a significant and missed opportunity to right a wrong.' </p>

<p>'We have taken steps to make sure that what happened with Ms Gobbo can never happen again.'</p>
