<p>Unstoppable: Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson impressively dismantled an electric-powered gate 'completely' by himself, after a power outage left him unable to get to work</p>

<p>While he attempted to override the hydraulic system to open the gates, which has previously worked, 'this time it wouldn’t.' </p>

<p>After being told getting a gate technician would take approximately 45 minutes, The Rock sprung into action, so nobody would be waiting on him to start their day. </p>

<p>'My security team was able to meet the gate technician and welders about an hour later — and they were apparently, “in disbelief and equally scared” as to how I ripped it off,' he told his 198 million Instagram followers.  </p>

<p>Earlier this week, his producing partner, Hiram Garcia, revealed the actor has recovered from coronavirus.  </p>

<p>Garcia, who is the brother of The Rock's ex-wife Dany Garcia, added that the icon is already back at work on his next film, the Netflix project Red Notice.  </p>

<p>Johnson's wife Lauren Hashian, 36, and their two daughters, Jasmine, four, and Tiana, two, were also infected with COVID-19.  </p>

<p>They all got it: The movie star said his wife Lauren Hashian, 36, and their two daughters, Jasmine, four, and Tiana, two, also got the virus</p>

<p>'He is a huge family man,' a source told People, while adding that he's also an intensely private person who is laser-focused on his family and his work.</p>

<p>The Fast &amp; Furious franchise star announced the news that his family had contracted the novel coronavirus on Wednesday, September 2, in a nearly 12-minute Instagram video.</p>

<p>'Testing positive for COVID-19 is a lot different than recovering from nasty injuries, getting evicted or being broke, which I've been more than a few times,' he began. </p>

<p>Doting father: 'He absolutely loves his girls. They live out of the spotlight so his girls can have a normal childhood,' an insider at People said of The Rock</p>

<p>'My No. 1 priority is to always protect my family and my loved ones... I wish it was only me that tested positive. It was my entire family and it was a kick in the gut. We in a family are good, we're on the other end of it and no longer contagious. Thank God, we're healthy.'</p>

<p>He added, 'We are counting our blessings right now. We are well aware you don’t always get to the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier.</p>

<p>'I have had some of my best friends lose their parents to this virus that is so incredibly relentless and unforgiving. We are counting our blessings, but we are good.'</p>
