<p>Members of congress are demanding action be taken against Netflix including a possible investigation by the Department of Justice after the film Cuties has sparked outrage for showing children dressed provocatively and twerking on camera</p>

<p>Indiana Congressman Jim Banks has called for the DOJ to bring child porn charges against Netflix</p>

<p>'As the mother of an 8-year old girl, I STRONGLY support #CancelNetflix,' added Beatrice Cardenas, another California Republican.</p>

<p>Democrat Tulsi Gabbard went as far as to accuse Netflix of being complicit in encouraging pedophilia and child trafficking. </p>

<p>Indiana Rep. Jim Banks called on the Department of Justice to bring legal action against Netflix.</p>

<p>'As a father of young daughters, I find it sickening. Not only is this movie fodder for pedophiles, it encourages very young girls to defy their parents' wishes and share pornographic images of themselves with strangers, ' Banks told the Daily Caller. 'Our culture has come a long way in recent years, recognizing the power of television, movies and magazines to affect young girls.</p>

<p>The film, directed by French-Senegalese director Maimouna Doucoure, started streaming September 9 </p>

<p>'The lessons taught in this film are not ones I want my daughters learning.' Banks continued, 'The DOJ should be readying charges against Netflix for distribution of child pornography.' </p>

<p>The outrage has spilled over on social media with tens of thousands of people calling for a boycott of Netflix over the French film entitled 'Mignonnes' -- known as 'Cuties' in English -- angry that its young stars were portrayed in a sexualized way.</p>

<p>Democrat Tulsi Gabbard accused Netflix of being complicit in encouraging pedophilia and child trafficking</p>

<p>Ryan Fournier who campaigns for younger Trump voters appeared delighted that the stock market value had fallen in recent days as they hashtag Cancel Netflix continues to spread</p>

<p>Tweets with the hashtag #CancelNetflix have became the top trending topic for the past several days. </p>

<p>A first wave of criticism, in August, led Netflix to withdraw 'inappropriate' artwork used to promote the film, which was released in theaters that month in France.</p>

<p>Netflix also said it apologized for having used 'inappropriate' images.</p>

<p>But now broader opposition to some of the imagery has come from across the political spectrum in the United States.</p>

<p>Several social media users accused Netflix of supporting child abuse by hosting the movie.  </p>

<p>Furious viewers continue to mount a cancel Netflix campaign as the controversial French film 'Cuties' hit the streaming service on Wednesday amid claims it supports child abuse</p>

<p>Social media users have hit out at people defending the movie as they claim that it  promotes pedophilia. A Netflix trailer of the movie featured dancing 11-year-old girls, pictured</p>

<p>Some social media users accused the movie of 'child porn'</p>

<p>Filmmaker Sonia Poulton blasted those who said the movie is 'art' calling them 'child abusers'</p>

<p>'Unbelievable that they released 'Cuties'. So child porn is ok now Netflix? Raise your hand if you agree this is disgusting,' wrote Twitter user David Fischer, adding the hashtag #CancelNetflix.    </p>

<p>'If you watch 11-year-olds twerk, you're a pervert. If you direct 11 year olds to touch themselves on camera, you're a pedophile. If you support Netflix making and airing #Cuties, you're enabling abuse,' said Republican candidate for Congress James P. Bradley. </p>

<p>Some critics hit out at those who are defending the movie and claimed that it should not be sold as art. </p>

<p>'Netflix is comfortable with this. Plenty of people will defend it. This is where our culture is at,' said Daily Caller writer Mary Margaret Olohan. </p>

<p>The campaign to cancel Netflix appeared to be growing judging by recent tweets</p>

<p>'If you call 'Cuties' art or a 'social statement'. I call you a child abuser. We have no time for niceties while children are being sexualized for mass entertainment,' added writer Sonia Poulton. </p>

<p>Others accused both Democrats and Republicans of not speaking out and urged them to call for its removal.  </p>

<p>'Our elected officials are mighty silent on the Cuties movie by Netflix. Even those running for office, supported by the top tiers of both establishment parties, are silent. I will never be silent. Why run just to be silent? #CancelNetflix and their board members,' said Republican House candidate Buzz Patterson. </p>

<p>Candidates for Congress also got involved in the debate</p>

<p>'The fact that mainstream media is making the pedophile-fodder of #Cuties into a right-v-left thing should truly embarrass anyone who is on the political left. Protecting children should be universal, not relegate to one side of the political spectrum,' wrote user JD Rucker.   </p>

<p>An online petition has also been started calling on people to cancel their Netflix subscription in light of its decision to host the movie. </p>

<p>'Please make the choice to prove to Netflix our children are more valuable than our entertainment, and our money is better spent else where!' reads the petition that has been signed by almost 620,000 people as of Friday evening.   </p>

<p>Shares in Netflix have continues to call over the last five days as more people demand the streaming service remove the film from its platform</p>

<p>An online petition calling for people to cancel their Netflix subscription over its hosting of the movie almost had 620,000 signatures as of Friday evening and was steadily growing </p>

<p>Cuties, tells the story of an 11-year-old Senegalese Muslim girl named Amy, pictured front</p>

<p>The film, which received a director's award at the prestigious Sundance Film Festival, tells the story of Amy, an 11-year-old Parisian, who must juggle the strict rules of her Senegalese family and social media's emphasis on appearance.</p>

<p>She joins a dance group formed by three other girls from her neighborhood, whose choreographies are sometimes suggestive.</p>

<p>However, while publicizing the movie, Netflix chose to focus almost solely on Amy's participation in her school dance team and their quest to 'twerk their way to stardom at a local dance contest'. </p>

<p>The site's trailer and poster featured imagery of pre-adolescent girls dancing provocatively in very skimpy outfits, while Netflix's description of the movie centered around their 'increasingly sensual dance routines'. </p>

<p>'The hypersexualization of girls (and boys) is disgusting,' tweeted Omar Navarro, another Republican politician. 'It is morally and ethically reprehensible. Pedophiles, child rapists and perverts would have a great time with #Cuties.'</p>

<p>Actress Tessa Thompson was among those to rush to the defense of the movie </p>

<p>Among the voices praising the movie were American actress Tessa Thompson ('Creed', 'Avengers: Endgame'), who found it 'beautiful.'</p>

<p>'It gutted me at <?php echo e('@'); ?>sundancefest,' she went on.</p>

<p>'It introduces a fresh voice at the helm. She's a French Senegalese Black woman mining her experiences.</p>

<p>'The film comments on the hyper-sexualization of preadolescent girls. Disappointed to see the current discourse. Disappointed to see how it was positioned in terms of marketing.</p>

<p>'I understand the response of everybody. But it doesn't speak to the film I saw.'</p>

<p>Many Twitter users highlighted the fact that Netflix was to blame for the provocative portrayal of the movie, but that didn't stop its director Doucouré from being attacked online </p>

<p>The original French promotional poster depicts the youngsters on a shopping trip</p>

<p>In stark contrast, the original poster for the movie - which has been used on other sites like IMDB - depicts the youngsters on a shopping trip. </p>

<p>Netflix has since issued an apology for the trailer and poster featuring the skimpy outfits.  </p>

<p>'We're deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Cuties,' a Netflix spokesperson said in a statement at the time. </p>

<p>'It was not OK, nor was it representative of this French film, which premiered at Sundance. We've now updated the pictures and description.'</p>

<p>Doucouré also received a phone call from the streaming site's co-CEO Ted Sarandos, who made a personal apology for the error, she revealed. </p>

<p>'We had several discussions back and forth after this happened. Netflix apologized publicly, and also personally to me,' the director shared. </p>

<p>Netflix has changed the synopsis for the movie now reading: 'Eleven-year-old Amy starts to rebel against her conservative family's traditions when she becomes fascinated with a free-spirited dance crew.'</p>

<p>However, before being changed, it read: '11-year-old Amy lives with her mom, Mariam, and younger brother, awaiting her father to rejoin the family from Senegal. </p>

<p>'Amy is fascinated by disobedient neighbor Angelica's free-spirited dance clique, a group that stands in sharp contrast to stoic Mariam's deeply held traditional values. </p>

<p>'Undeterred by the girls' initial brutal dismissal and eager to escape her family's simmering dysfunction, Amy, through an ignited awareness of her burgeoning femininity, propels the group to enthusiastically embrace an increasingly sensual dance routine, sparking the girls' hope to twerk their way to stardom at a local dance contest.'   </p>

<p>While the streaming site accepted full responsibility for the blunder the damage was already done, with both Doucouré and her movie facing furious attacks from thousands of outraged viewers. </p>

<p>She revealed she even received death threats after the 'hyper sexualized' poster and trailer went online. </p>

<p>According to Doucouré - and several film critics - it is meant to offer commentary on the dangers of society sexualizing its youth. Pictured, a scene from the movie</p>

<p> 'I received numerous attacks on my character from people who had not seen the film, who thought I was actually making a film that was apologetic about hyper-serialization of children,' she told Deadline. 'I also received numerous death threats.'</p>

<p>Maïmouna Doucouré, the director of upcoming Netflix movie Cuties, revealed she was sent death threats after a poster for the movie was slammed for 'sexualizing' minors </p>

<p>'I discovered the poster at the same time as the American public,' she explained. </p>

<p>'My reaction? It was a strange experience. I hadn't seen the poster until after I started getting all these reactions on social media, direct messages from people, attacks on me. I didn't understand what was going on. </p>

<p>'That was when I went and saw what the poster looked like.'       </p>

<p>A Netflix spokesperson said: 'Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of young children.</p>

<p>'It's an award winning film and a powerful story about the pressure young girls face on social media and from society more generally growing up, and we'd encourage anyone who cares about these important issues to watch the movie.'</p>
