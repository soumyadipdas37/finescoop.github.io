<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gordon Ramsay has split opinion after sharing a video of his chocolate tofu pudding, which has been branded 'perhaps the most unappetising and unappealing dessert ever'.</p>

<p>The TV chef, 53, posted a Facebook video of the £10 pudding, which is the signature dessert of his swanky Mayfair restaurant Lucky Cat, which specialises in Asian cuisine. </p>

<p>The post quickly racked up 25,000 likes and 4,700 comments, with some saying they'd like to taste the dish, but others were left baffled by what looked like a 'brown paper bag' placed on top. </p>

<p>Another very impressed user penned: 'First the poop in the middle, then covered by a layer of what looks like fat, and topped with a piece of pork crackling.' </p>

<p>'Looked great until he put that brown paper on it. Totally ruined it', one wrote. </p>

<p>'He covered the beautiful part! I'm sure it tastes delicious but the white stuff and the brown sheet do not look appetizing,' said another. </p>

<p>One vivid user compared the dessert to being 'covered by a layer of what looks like fat, and topped with a piece of pork crackling'</p>

<p>Meanwhile some users were dubious about the idea of putting chocolate with tofu all together, with one saying: 'Chocolate and tofu should not be used in the same sentence.'</p>

<p>'Love you Gordon but chocolate and tofu? I would rather eat the chocolate cake thank you', commented another. </p>

<p>A third agreed: 'Sorry, but chocolate and tofu should NEVER be used together in any way, shape or form whether physically or verbally.'</p>
