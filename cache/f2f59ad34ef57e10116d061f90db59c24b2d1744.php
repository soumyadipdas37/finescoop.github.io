<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ageas isn't a particularly familiar name to many British investors – except, perhaps, those who like cricket.</p>

<p>The listed Belgian insurance giant sponsors the home of Hampshire cricket in Southampton – the Rose Bowl – where England recently played the West Indies and Pakistan.</p>

<p>But now Ageas has also caught the attention of punters in the London market after rumours swirled on Friday that it could once again be a takeover target.</p>

<p>Two years ago speculation did the rounds that Fosun, the highly acquisitive Chinese conglomerate, was interested in buying Ageas outright. In part, that's because Fosun – then led by Guo Guangchang, a self-styled 'Chinese Warren Buffett' – already owns a large stake in Ageas.</p>

<p>However, after the market closed on Friday a Bloomberg report revealed Ageas had received a takeover approach from BE Group, a mysterious investment firm backed by a former banker from Lazard called Mark Pensaert.</p>

<p>Ageas told the newswire it had reviewed the BE Group proposal but decided 'not to engage'. Still, punters are hopeful this may be the opening salvo of a takeover tussle that could involve multiple parties.</p>

<p>Small cap enthusiasts might want to keep an eye on Seeing Machines, a company involved in developing driver monitoring software.</p>

<p>Word is that the company is 'ideally positioned' to benefit from further major contract wins as large motor manufacturers strive to meet new safety regulations.</p>

<p>Well-spoken chaps in the City of London believe this firm could easily find itself part of a larger group by the time the regulations come into force. </p>

<p>Morrisons is set to confirm this week that dealing with the biggest short-term sales surge in its history can be costly.</p>

<p>Like-for-like sales rose 9.5 per cent. But the supermarket is expected to say first half profit fell from £198million to £145million as it reorganised stores, drafted in thousands of extra staff, then shouldered the cost of ramping up online deliveries for isolating customers.</p>

<p>More revealing will be chief executive David Potts' outlook for the months ahead. It is unlikely that customers will be spending at such an unprecedented rate.</p>

<p>But cash-strapped shoppers could be price-hunting on a scale not seen since the banking crisis, and investors will be keen to hear whether he thinks he can maintain some of that sales momentum.</p>

<p>Swiss bank Credit Suisse forecasts trade at clothing chains will be 'modest' at best next year, though 'bleak' might a better word.</p>

<p>But are there any bargains to be had? Retail analyst Simon Irwin last week downgraded H&amp;M and Spanish clothing company Inditex as over-spaced and over-valued.</p>

<p>He's also neutral on Next, hinting that the price may slip to £50 (from £56.98 currently). He says opportunists – at least those not already battered by this year's falls – might be better off seeking out the shares of M&amp;S or Associated British Foods, which he says 'remain extremely cheap'.</p>

<p>He has slapped price targets of £1.25 on M&amp;S (the shares are currently at £1.09) and £25.30 for Associated British Foods (with shares currently at £20.27). However, he admits 'the timing of any catalysts is unclear'.  </p>
