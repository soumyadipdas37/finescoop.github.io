<p>And Jennifer Metcalfe appeared in good spirits as she strolled through Manchester Piccadilly Train Station late last month, days after making her split announcement.</p>

<p>Stepping out: Jennifer Metcalfe appeared in good spirits as she strolled through Manchester Piccadilly Train Station late last month, days after making her split announcement</p>

<p>As summer drew to a close, the actress, who plays Mercedes McQueen in the Channel 4 soap, kept warm in her stylish outerwear, which she paired with a smart crossbody bag.</p>

<p>Beneath her coat, Jennifer donned a monochrome striped T-shirt and white leggings, which she paired with trainers.</p>

<p>She swept her brunette tresses into a chic bun, while she let her natural beauty shine through by going make-up free. </p>

<p>The star appeared to be having a busy day during her outing as she carried a shopping bag, an item of clothing on a hanger and a hot beverage.</p>

<p>Whoops: The Hollyoaks star, 36, cut a chic figure in a long, brown woolen coat, however, she appeared to ignore health advice by forgetting to wear a face mask</p>

<p>However, Jennifer's busy day may no doubt have contributed to her forgetting her face mask as government guidelines request that people wear face coverings in stations and on public transport.</p>

<p>The thespian even walked past a huge sign urging people to wear face coverings, while she seemed oblivious of other people in masks around her. </p>

<p>Last month, Jennifer revealed her relationship with ex Geordie Shore star Greg, with whom she raises son Daye, three, secretly ended during lockdown. </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram to reveal the news, she wrote: 'Greg and I decided to part ways amicably a couple months ago.</p>

<p>Sad news: Jennifer revealed on Instagram last month that she secretly split from Greg Lake months ago following an eight year romance (she shared this picture in April) </p>

<p>'We remain friends and we both will continue to happily co parent Daye and would appreciate privacy during these times.</p>

<p>Jennifer has been regularly sharing pictures of herself with Greg and Daye on her Instagram, with the last family picture appearing on July 12.</p>

<p>It seems that the couple had already split at this point, but they remain close.</p>

<p>In 2018, Jennifer said she thought Greg had proposed to her following their long romance, but she wasn't having any of it anyway.</p>

<p>She told Loose Women at the time: 'I thought Greg had proposed to me on my birthday. He got a ring out, I’d just got back from work.</p>

<p>Amicable split: Jennifer shared this post as she thanked those around her who have been supportive </p>

<p>'I was too tired for it. I said "can we please do this another time, I’m tired". It was just a ring 'for us' though, not an engagement one.'</p>

<p>But the year before, Jennifer told Fabulous magazine that marriage was very much in their plans.</p>

<p>She said: 'We’ll probably do it like a party and be like: "Let’s get married next month and we’ll text our friends".'</p>

<p>'There will be no ring or anything.'</p>

<p>Announcement: Greg shared an almost identical post to Jennifer on the same day </p>
