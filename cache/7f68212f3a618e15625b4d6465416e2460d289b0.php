<p>Between 20 to 25 people are feared trapped under the rubble of the four-story building in Maharashtra state that collapsed at around 4 am, said India's National Disaster Response Force, and rescuers are working to find and free them. </p>

<p>Some residents were trying to get out of the building, in the industrial town of Bhiwandi, 25 miles northeast of Mumbai, after cracks appeared in it in the middle of the night, when it crashed down.</p>

<p>At least 11 people were injured when the building collapsed, said Pankaj Ashiya, the commissioner of Bhiwandi in Thane district, a suburb of India's financial capital Mumbai.</p>

<p>He said the building was more than 30 years old and needed repairs, which could not be carried out due to the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>Ansari said he went back up to alert more people and was on the first floor with some other residents when the building it came down.</p>

<p>Torrential rain is often blamed for building collapses in India, with the number of incidents, often involving old or illegally built buildings, rising during the June-September monsoon.</p>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences on Twitter. 'Praying for a quick recovery of those injured. Rescue operations are underway and all possible assistance is being provided to the affected,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Maharashtra is one of India's hardest hit states by the virus with over a million reported cases. India has reported over 5.4 million coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>Last month, more than a dozen people were killed when a building collapsed in the industrial town of Mahad, 100 miles south of Mumbai. </p>
