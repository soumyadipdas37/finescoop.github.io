<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 'Coffin Confessor' who gets paid thousands to gatecrash funerals at the request of the dead has revealed the most outrageous things he's had to tell grieving relatives.</p>

<p>Bill Edgar was a private investigator until an elderly man asked him to step in at his funeral three years ago to call out his best friend for 'trying to screw' his wife.</p>

<p>The Gold Coast man has since made a thriving business divulging his dead clients' explosive secrets to their heartbroken families during burials and will readings. </p>

<p>Speaking on the Kyle and Jackie O show on Tuesday, Mr Edgar - whose clients pay up to $10,000 for his services - revealed his most shocking confessions.</p>

<p>'I've exposed family secrets, sexual affairs and intimate relationships between brothers and sisters,' he told the stunned hosts.</p>

<p>Mr Edgar said his worst job was when he had to reveal a girlfriend had slept with her partner's mother and father. </p>

<p>'Basically, there weren't many people left at the funeral,' he said. </p>

<p>Another request involved telling the family of a bikie gang member that he was gay and his lover was in the crowd.</p>

<p>'Half a dozen people left, a couple gave me the finger and told me that I was going to get bashed, but the majority said, "we know what he was like, and we knew".'</p>

<p>To avoid gatecrashing funerals with false assumptions and accusations, Mr Edgar uses his private investigation skills to verify his clients' claims.</p>

<p>'I've got to get some actual facts too - I've got to look in to it. I can't just go to a funeral and announce bullsh**t, it's got to be legitimate stuff.' </p>

<p>Along with airing people's dirty laundry, Mr Edgar spends most of his time purging his dead clients' homes of embarrassing items to spare their families the discomfort (stock image of a funeral)</p>

<p>Along with airing people's dirty laundry, Mr Edgar spends most of his time purging his dead clients' homes of embarrassing items to spare their families the discomfort. </p>

<p>One customer was an 88-year-old man from Toowoomba in Queensland who asked the coffin confessor to clean his attic.</p>

<p>'He said "you're going to find some items in there that are going to shock you"'.</p>

<p>'I got in the attic and there's a sex swing, there's toys - you name it, it was there.' </p>

<p>Mr Edgar explained that he never has to ask his clients questions about their seemingly bizarre secrets because 'they divulge everything ... they've got nothing to lose'.</p>

<p>Some clients have also used his services to confess to crimes.</p>

<p>While he is obliged to report admissions to the police, Mr Edgar skirts around the problem by asking the person write confession down in a letter and address it to themselves.</p>

<p>The coffin confessor picks the unopened letter up after the client dies and places it in a drawer and leaves it there.</p>

<p>'It's illegal to open someone else's mail,' he said.</p>

<p>Other strange requests come from clients who want want to be buried with specific items, such as money, firearms, and mobile phones with torches because they're scared of the dark.</p>

<p>Some ask for glass coffins, caskets filled with water or fitted with speakers programmed to make screaming sounds as it's lowered into the ground. </p>

<p>Bill Edgar has also been asked to prick some clients in the arm with a pin before the burial to make sure they're really dead</p>

<p>'One person wanted their coffin to be upside-down, on top of their wife's coffin, in the 69 position,' he said.</p>

<p>He has also been asked to prick some clients in the arm with a pin before the burial to make sure they're really dead.</p>

<p>To use the coffin confessor's services, dying clients must sign a contract giving Mr Edgar the right to call the service off and take the body away if the family try to stop him from doing his job.</p>

<p>They are also asked to video themselves giving Mr Edgar permission to carry out their final wishes.</p>

<p>When asked whether he feels guilty about slapping upset friends and family members with shocking details during a vulnerable time, he said: 'I'm not respecting the living.' </p>

<p>'My clients are dead and I like them more than the people who are alive.'  </p>

<p>Clients are asked to video themselves giving Mr Edgar permission to carry out their final wishes</p>

<p>But the messages Mr Edgar shares aren't always of vengeance and resentment, The Gold Coast Bulletin previously reported.</p>

<p>Once a month, he sends a letter to a man telling him that his wife loves him and will never forget him, at the dead woman's request. </p>

<p>The Coffin Confessor previously told Daily Mail Australia he was once asked by a man dying from pancreatic cancer to euthanize his dog so it could be with him 'in heaven'.</p>

<p>'His instructions were that he wanted to take his dog with him, and he wanted someone to take his dog's life so they could be together in heaven,' he said.  </p>

<p>Despite Mr Edgar saying he would jump at every opportunity if it paid, he draws the line in assisting with death, saying it's something he would never do. </p>

<p>A more morbid case Mr Edgar was faced with came from a man on his death bed with pancreatic cancer, whose dying wish was to have his beloved pet dog die with him</p>

<p>Although Mr Edgar's intrusions at funerals are often met with hostility from mourners, some of his clients' family members actually thank him for his help.</p>

<p>'I had the daughter of a man that died came up to me and said her dad would be so proud that you told his brother and sister-in-law to "f**k off",' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Edgar said at this particular funeral he even improvised and added in a few choice words of his own. </p>

<p>He also had three separate requests in one week from people who asked him to dress up as Homer Simpson for their funeral. </p>

<p>'I think it's for more of a themed-funeral, it's more lighthearted. I guess people pick their idol and want me to surprise everyone,' he said. </p>

<p>Some to wonder if he could simply not fulfill his client's wishes and pocket the cash after they die.</p>

<p>'My clients say to me "look I'm paying you this money, if you rip me off I won't know but I'll see you one day in heaven",' he said.</p>
