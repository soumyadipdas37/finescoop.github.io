<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona striker Luis Suarez has reportedly got in touch with Juventus chief Pavel Nedved over a potential transfer that would see him link up with Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

<p>The former Liverpool front man is set to leave the Nou Camp this summer, after being told by new manager Ronald Koeman that he is not in his plans moving forward.</p>

<p>With Gonzalo Higuain leaving the Old Lady, the club are in the market for a striker and Suarez could fit the bill.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez has reportedly contacted Juventus over a transfer away from Barcelona</p>

<p>New Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman told the striker that he is not in his plans moving forward</p>

<p>According to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, Suarez and Nedved have began talks over a potential switch that would see him join the Serie A champions.</p>

<p>The early signs appear to be positive and it is very possible that Ronaldo will have a new strike partner in Luis Suarez.</p>

<p>Both stars have spent most of the last decade in Spain, where they featured on opposing ends of a fierce rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona.</p>

<p>In their prime, Suarez had a partnership with Lionel Messi and Neymar for the Catalan club whilst Ronaldo led the line alongside Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale at Madrid.</p>

<p>The potential move would see Suarez link up with his old rival Cristiano Ronaldo</p>

<p>Suarez and Juve chief Pavel Nedved have been locked in talks which are going positively</p>

<p>The Uruguayan is happy to take his time over a deal and is waiting to see all his options, whilst the Italian side are more eager to get a transfer over the line with the new season fast approaching.</p>

<p>Juventus have also been eyeing up Roma striker Edin Dzeko, but they will not let him leave unless they have a replacement lined up.</p>

<p>Suarez did turn up to Barcelona headquarters for covid-19 testing ahead of the new campaign, despite his exit talks with Koeman leaving him furious.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi did not turn up for testing, as his potential exit has shocked the footballing world following Koeman's appointment and a poor season last time out.</p>
