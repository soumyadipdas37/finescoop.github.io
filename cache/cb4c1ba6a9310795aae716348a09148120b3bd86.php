<p>The cult beauty brand behind a best-selling facial soap (left) that banishes acne in just days has now unveiled its 'miracle serum' (right)for the first time in Australia</p>

<p>And dozens of women agree it's one of the best serums that money can buy, with many swearing by the product for transforming their complexion within days, leaving them with clearer skin. </p>

<p>'This is amazing, I have had bad skin and spots for years, plenty of hospital creams and medicines and still didn't work. Been using this for 11 days now and my skin feels amazing soft, nice colour and nearly no spots,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second added: 'Absolutely brilliant product. I'm now on to my third bottle of the serum. The best product I've ever used on my skin at night.' </p>

<p>While a third said: 'Amazing! Just like everything else Carbon Theory have made, this is a miracle in a bottle. My skin has never looked better. I love the appearance of the little bottle it comes in, and the smell is nice too.'</p>

<p>One of the reasons why it's so popular is because it contains 'lab-formulated' ingredients that claims to create a tight barrier around cells, leaving skin healthy and hydrated for longer.</p>

<p>The serum promises to soothe the effects of inflammation and redness, providing relief to itchy and irritated skin.</p>

<p>Australian woman Jennifer Wilson who suffered severe cystic acne has cleared up her skin in just a matter of weeks after using the brand's $14.99 facial cleansing bar (picture of the results one month apart of using Breakout Control Facial Cleansing Bar morning and night)</p>

<p>The activated charcoal draws out dirt and unblock pores while the tea tree oil has purifying properties to cleanse the skin and kills bacteria.</p>

<p>The Overnight Detox Serum is now available to purchase exclusively from the online Australian store for just $31.99.</p>

<p>The product now joins the best-selling $14.99 Breakout Control Facial Cleansing Bar, which launched at Priceline Australia earlier this year - and is now sold every 30 seconds worldwide.</p>

<p>Made with organic tea tree oil and charcoal to reduce inflammation, acne sufferers who tried the cleansing bar have praised its ability to transform their skin where other products had previously failed.</p>

<p>Fans of the soap claim it's better than medicated products they've previously tried on prescription, describing it as a 'miracle worker'. </p>
