<p>Throwback! Lucy Fallon, 24, looked completely unrecognisable in teenage throwbacks, which she shared to Instagram on Sunday as she took a trip down memory lane</p>

<p>Cute! The second shot was black-and-white, and saw the actress with her long tresses in dishevelled curls</p>

<p>It comes after Lucy and Joe Weller, 24, led the stars filming Don't Rock The Boat in Oban, Scotland, amid claims they have grown closer after her split from Tom Leech, 29. </p>

<p>The Bethany Platt actress is said to now be single after calling things off with Tom following three years together, after lockdown was said to have 'drove them apart.'</p>

<p>And it appears that a potential romance could be on the horizon again as it's claimed that there's a 'spark' between her and Joe amid fans' speculation that he fancies her.  </p>

<p>However, it's also reported that her closeness with Joe has caused a rift among her and Tom's friends, with some claiming it's 'a pretty bad look.' </p>

<p>Close: Lucy looked super close to YouTuber Joe Weller, 24, in a cosy clip shared to her social media earlier this month</p>

<p>The former Coronation Street star and the YouTuber wrapped up in raincoats and fleeces as they prepared to film ITV reality show Don't Rock The Boat.</p>

<p>She looked super close to her co-star Joe in a cosy clip shared to her social media - images which, according to The Sun, drove her ex Tom to swiftly delete his Instagram account.  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted Lucy Fallon's representative for comment. </p>

<p>And according to The Sun, the two have been getting along swimmingly during downtime from filming.</p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'Lucy and Joe clicked from day one of filming on Don't Rock The Boat. It's a tight-knit group but Lucy and Joe had a spark, everyone noticed it.' </p>

<p>Not impressed: According to The Sun, just hours after Lucy's post was shared, her ex Tom Leech, 29, swiftly deleted his Instagram account (pictured in 2019)</p>
