<p>She added: 'It's incredibly old. We have a thatched roof, which currently has an enormous hornet's nest in it. </p>

<p>'I do love to think about the house and all the people who have lived there. Were they happy, how did they live? All the families passing under those ancient beams.'</p>

<p>Rose was catapulted to fame with her role of Ygritte in Game Of Thrones where she met Kit who played love interest Jon Snow.</p>

<p>Speaking to Stylist magazine about her time in lockdown, Rose said: 'I feel incredibly grateful. My husband and I were fortunate to spend lockdown in the countryside.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'We raised a puppy in lockdown. We were trying to eke out conversation over the dinner table, talking about nothing but what we'd eat the next day. It has been an extraordinary time for all of us, it certainly slowed us down.' </p>
