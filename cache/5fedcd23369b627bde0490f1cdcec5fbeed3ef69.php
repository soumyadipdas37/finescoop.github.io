<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea are reportedly putting the final touches to their move for German sensation Kai Havertz, with the midfielder said to have completed a medical on Sunday.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard's side have been linked with the exciting youngster all summer, and now talks have reached the advanced stages.</p>

<p>Havertz undertook medical for his new club on Sunday, leaving everything set in place to now complete a deal which is set to shatter the British transfer record, according to Bild.</p>

<p>Chelsea are on the brink of confirming Kai Havertz as their marquee summer signing</p>

<p>The German publication state all formalities are done and that the 23-year-old has only passed medical examinations.</p>

<p>It appears that the attacking midfielder will be officially announced by Chelsea in the coming days. </p>

<p>Havertz would join fellow German star Timo Werner, who was a big money arrival for the Blues earlier in the window.</p>

<p>The youngster is currently away with the German team ahead of international action</p>

<p>With add-ons included the deal for Havertz is set to surpass Paul Pogba's to Manchester United</p>

<p>Just this week Chelsea defender Antonio Rudiger had joked he had acted as an agent to bring Werner to Stamford Bridge, and was hoping to do the same with Havertz.</p>

<p>It is reported that Chelsea will pay Leverkusen's asking price of £90million (€100m) plus add-ons.</p>

<p>This will make the deal the most lucrative in British transfer history, surpassing the deal Manchester Unite struck with Juventus for the transfer of Paul Pogba. </p>
