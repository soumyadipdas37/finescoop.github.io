<p>'I am so proud of the tireless efforts of everyone behind the scenes and onscreen. </p>

<p>'We have been energised and motivated by the nearly 60 years of heritage behind the show, and the massively important place it still holds in the Nation’s hearts.</p>

<p>'Throughout lockdown and beyond, the regular instalments of Britain’s best-loved soap have taken on even greater significance, giving viewers a beacon of familiarity and normality amid the craziest of times.</p>

<p>'It is often said that our characters are like members of the viewers’ extended families.</p>

<p>'And at a time when many people couldn’t see their loved ones in real life, their fictional friends on the cobbles became even more essential, as the audience escaped in half-hour bursts into the wonderful world of Weatherfield.' </p>
