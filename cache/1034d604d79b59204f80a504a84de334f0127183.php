<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Micah Richards believes Manchester City have some serious defensive issues to sort out if they are to reclaim their place as champions of England.</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola's side face Wolves in their first game of the new campaign on Monday night and Richards is doubtful that they will be fully prepared.</p>

<p>'City’s problems are defensive,' Sportsmail's columnist said during his role as a pundit on Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'Losing Vincent Kompany was a massive risk. Losing Laporte for a lot of last season was a massive miss. Problem lies with Fernandinho dropping back and Rodri trying to fill in the gaps. The defence is then left too exposed. </p>

<p>There’s no real consistency. I don’t even think Pep knows his best back four. Kyle Walker is probably the only certainty in that side. </p>

<p>He’s not trusting his team. When I was playing under Mancini we’d always rotate the full-backs, it’s just that centre back pairing. </p>

<p>'The manager has lost faith in his centre backs - every window they’re linked with one. They’ve brought in Ake - is he going to be the one to lead that line? I’m not too sure.</p>
