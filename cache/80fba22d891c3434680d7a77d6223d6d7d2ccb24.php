<p>Baby news? The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (right) has sent fans into a frenzy after dropping a not-so-subtle hint that he and Irena Srbinovska (left) are expecting a child together</p>

<p>He shared a photo of himself and Irena, 31, from the finale, and wrote: 'I have always listened to my heart and it has led me to this point.</p>

<p>'As hard as it was to say goodbye, I was also saying hello to my future wife, baby mumma and best friend. </p>

<p>'I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Here is to one crazy adventure and so, so many more with you, babe.'</p>

<p>Please explain! The 31-year-old shared an update to Instagram on Thursday, right after the finale aired, and it didn't take long for his followers to notice his odd choice of words</p>

<p>Wait... what?! Locky made a reference to Irena being his 'baby mumma' and didn't clarify that he was speaking about future family plans </p>

<p>The fact Locky didn't preface 'baby mumma' with 'future' - which he had done when calling Irena his 'future wife' - prompted a flurry of pregnancy speculation in the comments section. </p>

<p>However, it's likely he was just speaking about their family plans for the next few years.</p>

<p>The couple told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Friday they were planning a five-month hike around Papua New Guinea and the Americas as soon as international borders open.</p>

<p>Such a task would be very difficult if Irena were pregnant.</p>

<p>Jumping to conclusions: It's likely he was just speaking about their family plans for the next few years. The couple said on Friday they were planning a five-month hike around Papua New Guinea as soon as borders open - and such a task would be very difficult if Irena were pregnant</p>

<p>During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Irena and Bella Varelis he was falling in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.</p>

<p>He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.</p>

<p>'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.</p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'</p>

<p>Conflicted: During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Irena and Bella Varelis he was falling in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home</p>

<p>As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'</p>

<p>She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'</p>

<p>After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena, telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her.</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he said.</p>

<p>Dumped: He broke down in tears as Bella (pictured) arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things</p>

<p>'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'</p>

<p>Locky teased another blindside when he admitted to Irena that he'd had his doubts about their relationship.</p>

<p>'However, my biggest fear is that you're not going to be able to put yourself first, or tell me no. And in my partner, I want drive and ambition,' he said.</p>

<p>'And I think you've got that in spades,' he added, much to Irena's relief.</p>

<p>Ciao, Bella: As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going'</p>

<p>'When I think about our future together, I'm so excited and I can't wait to just travel the world and make all your dreams come true.</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'</p>

<p>'I love you too!' she replied, as swelling music and a sweeping camera shot marked the dramatic end of Locky's journey to find love.</p>

<p>The couple are still together two months after filming the finale, and Irena has packed up her life in Melbourne to live with Locky in Perth.</p>

<p>The end! After his emotional break-up with Bella, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena (pictured), telling her he 'couldn't wait' to spend the rest of his life with her</p>
