<p>Liverpool have been frontrunners for the Spain international for quite some time now, with the two clubs still jostling over the transfer fee. </p>

<p>According to Bild, Thiago has received contact from his former club over a possible move back to his homeland as he says his goodbyes at Bayern ahead of his probable exit.</p>

<p>Barcelona have made contact with Bayern midfielder Thiago Alcantara over a potential return</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman is beginning his summer rebuild as the new Barcelona manager</p>

<p>Thiago left the Nou Camp back in 2013, when the Bundesliga giants activated his £22.4million release clause.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old has had an incredibly successful career with Bayern, winning seven Bundesliga titles - one for every year he has been in Bavaria.</p>

<p>He also recently featured in the Champions League final against PSG, where he helped the German's claim a 1-0 victory and win his first European cup with the team in potentially his final ever match.</p>

<p>Liverpool have been frontrunners for the Spain international for quite some time now</p>

<p>His current deal is set to expire next summer and despite Bayern wanting to extend his contract, he has backed off and made it clear that he wishes to join a new team.</p>

<p>Thiago came through the Spanish club's famed academy to break into the first-team in 2009. After four years, which saw two LaLiga triumphs and a Champions League trophy, a return could now be on the cards.</p>

<p>Even though Barcelona have made contact with the midfielder according to the reports, plenty would still need to fall in place in order for him to make a shock return. </p>

<p>Barca have made Liverpool Georginio Wijnaldum a priority for this summer, as new manager Ronald Koeman continues his summer rebuild at the Catalan club.</p>

<p>Koeman has worked with the Reds midfielder before in his former post as the Holland national team head coach. </p>

<p>With their financial situation not looking as healthy as usual, due to the coronavirus pandemic, it is very unlikely they will have the funds to afford to bring in Thiago alongside Wijnaldum.</p>
