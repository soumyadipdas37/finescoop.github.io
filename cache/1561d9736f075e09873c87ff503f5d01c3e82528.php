<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother who has shed more than half of her body weight following a ketogenic diet has revealed that cruel online trolls call her 'disgusting' and accuse her of being 'anorexic' now that she is a size zero. </p>

<p>Cindi Quinn, a 35-year-old stay-at-home mom from West Chester, Pennsylvania, had always been on the bigger side, and ever since her teens, she weighed close to 200lbs and wore a size 16.  </p>

<p>After having her three children - Jaxson, six, Colton, three, and Penny Laine, one - with husband, Daniel, 34, her weight soared to 250lbs, and at her heaviest, she wore a size 22.  </p>

<p>Then and wow: Cindi Quinn, 35, from West Chester, Pennsylvania, has gone from 250lbs (left) to 115lbs (right) by following a low-carb, high-fat keto diet</p>

<p>Hard to handle: Cindi had been overweight her entire life and tried various diets with varying levels of success, but she would always gain the weight back </p>

<p>'I've always been kind of bigger and it made me feel depressed, fatigued, and like I had no confidence at all,' Cindi said.  </p>

<p>On average, she would consume over 3,500 calories a day, eating Pop-Tarts for breakfast and fast food for lunch and dinner.  </p>

<p>Over the years, Cindi had tried various diets like Weight Watchers with varying levels of success, but the weight would pile back on eventually.</p>

<p>'The trigger for me to lose weight was when I wasn't able to put my child to bed without feeling like my legs were going to explode while I kneeled,' the mother-of-three recalled.    </p>

<p>Cindi started researching the popular keto diet and followed people on Instagram who were on the low-carb, high-fat meal plan for both tips and motivation.  </p>

<p>Struggling: After having her three children - Jaxson, six, Colton, three, and Penny Laine, one - with husband, Daniel, 34, her weight soared to 250lbs, and at her heaviest, she wore a size 22</p>

<p>All smiles: After losing 135lbs, Cindi has never been healthier or happier </p>

<p>'Every time I scrolled down my feed I saw people killing it with their diets,' she said. 'When the weight started to drop off, every small victory felt amazing. </p>

<p>'I celebrated anything and everything: getting my wedding rings back on, dropping a pant size, being able to keep up with my kids.</p>

<p>'This kept me motivated and now I have more energy, strength, and confidence. I am able to run with my kids and play with them in ways I never could before,' she added. </p>

<p>'The mental part is actually the hardest. If you don't have your mind right, it doesn't matter what you eat, you will fail.' </p>

<p>The five-foot-four mom is now in the best shape of her life; she is a super svelte 115lbs and wears a size zero after losing 135lbs. </p>

<p>Unhealthy: Cindi used to consume over 3,500 calories a day, eating Pop-Tarts for breakfast and fast food for lunch and dinner</p>

<p>Incredible: Cindi began losing weight following the popular high-fat, low-carb keto diet. She lost the majority of her weight through diet alone </p>

<p>Getting toned: Cindi only started going to the gym to lift weights at the start of this year </p>

<p>Cindi lost the majority of her weight through diet alone and only started going to the gym at the start of this year to lift weights.</p>

<p>She consumes between 1,200 to 1,500 calories a day and has protein shakes for breakfast, a Caesar salad without croutons for lunch, and a dinner of lean meat or fish with broccoli, green beans, cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts.</p>

<p>Most people are impressed by Cindi's transformation, but some people have told her she's taken her weight loss journey too far. </p>

<p>'I receive mostly positive comments from people who say how toned my muscles are and how disciplined I am to have stuck with this, but some people will say I lost too much because they are used to seeing a larger person,' she explained. </p>

<p>'Originally this made me feel self-conscious. My photo was spread through Instagram and people called me horrible things like "disgusting," "anorexic," [and] "unhealthy."</p>

<p>'I cried myself to sleep, but then I got angry,' she recalled. 'I worked very hard for almost three years. I am very healthy. So, I responded to the comments defending myself. I made a post explaining myself saying that I had blood work that has all improved from when I was heavier. </p>

<p>Before and after: Cindi now wears a size zero, but she admitted that online trolls tell her she looks 'disgusting' and 'anorexic'</p>

<p>Take that: Cindi said people's cruel comments about her body used to make her cry, but now she proudly defends the weight loss she worked so hard for </p>

<p>Candid: The mom admitted that she has painful loose skin following her weight loss, but she noted that it's better than carrying around an extra 135lbs </p>

<p>Social media: Cindi is the happiest she has ever been and she shares her story on Instagram under the handle <?php echo e('@'); ?>ketostrongnotskinny</p>

<p>'Now if someone says something, I simply say 'I'm sorry you feel that way.'</p>

<p>Cindi is the happiest she has ever been and she shares her story on Instagram under the handle <?php echo e('@'); ?>ketostrongnotskinny. She has been candid about the changes to her body since she lost weight. </p>

<p>She does have some loose skin, which is sometimes painful, but she said it's better than carrying around the extra weight. </p>

<p>'I have loose skin,' she admitted. 'I'm not exactly thrilled about it, but it's better than carrying around that 135lbs. 'It does make me feel self-conscious and uncomfortable and it's actually quite painful.'</p>

<p>But her weight loss journey has been worth it, and she believes others can follow win her footsteps.  </p>

<p>'My advice would be to start as simple as possible and add exercise later,' she said. 'I didn't start working out until a year in. Diet and exercise from the start will burn you out and make you give up.'</p>
