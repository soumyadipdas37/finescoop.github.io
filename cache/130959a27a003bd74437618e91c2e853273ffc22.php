<p>Few dispute the significance of a brother or sister during a person's formative years, but siblings also influence life decisions as an adult, such as marriage and children.  </p>

<p>A study from researchers at the University of Cologne spanning 32 years found people are more likely to get married, divorced or become a parent if they see a sibling do it first.  </p>

<p>Few dispute the significance of a brother or sister during a person's formative years, but a study has found they also influence decisions on the biggest life events, such as marriage and children (stock)</p>

<p>Researchers analysed data from 4,521 individuals from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), which collected information on marital and family life between 1984 and 2016. </p>

<p>The likelihood of getting married increases after watching a brother or sister tie the knot, the study shows. </p>

<p>'An individual’s propensity to marry increases after a sibling’s marriage and remain significant in the long-term,' the researcher write in the study. </p>

<p>A study from researchers at the University of Cologne spanning 32 years found people become more likely to get married, divorced or become a parent if they see their sibling do it first (Stock)</p>

<p>'This finding is in line with the idea that a sibling’s entry into marriage may exert pressure, especially through parents, to form a family.'</p>

<p>A similar surge in probability also occurs if a sibling has a child but only for a short period of time. </p>

<p>'Similar to previous research, we find this effect to be short-lived, peaking in the first three years and declining afterward,' the scientists write. </p>

<p>Unsurprising, the phenomenon was also seen in reverse and have a negative effect. </p>

<p>For example, if a person watches their sibling get divorced, it makes them less likely to get married themselves.</p>

<p>The study's lead author, Zafer Buyukkececi, said: 'Taken together, our results support the idea that the process of family formation is interdependent among siblings.'        </p>

<p>Full findings are published in the journal Advances in Life Course Research.  </p>

<p>The tendency to have boys or girls does not run in the family and the chances of having a child of either sex is genuinely random, scientists have found.</p>

<p>Researchers studied the sex of people born in Sweden over the last 90 years to determine whether or not people are more likely to have children of a given sex.</p>

<p>Their findings shake up key theories over sex ratios used by biologists, who often assumed that the ratio of boys to girls in one's offspring was a heritable trait. </p>

<p>The researchers found that the ratio of boys to girls a person has is not an inherent property that passes down through the generations.</p>

<p>Instead, the sex of one's children is essentially random, although with slightly more male children born in general. </p>
