<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thoughtful, poised, and ready to save Britain from economic doom... welcome to a behind-the-scenes (and totally unscripted) insight into Rishi Sunak's preparations for his big day in the Commons. </p>

<p>Whether he's diligently reading through his Winter Economy Plan for one final check, staring out of a window deep in thought or delivering a motivational speech to staff, our Chancellor, 40, is seen to be totally on top of his game.</p>

<p>In other snaps he's pictured checking his phone - no doubt for some weighty matters of state rather than the family WhatsApp group - and pondering the latest policy initiative from behind his desk, hands resting on hips.</p>

<p>The images were released by the Treasury as part of a publicity drive to mark the unveiling of today's multi-billion rescue package, which includes a scheme to top up the pay of people who can only work part-time in 'viable jobs'.</p>

<p>It also included further VAT cuts for the hospitality and retail sectors and the extension of emergency loan schemes for struggling businesses.</p>

<p>Mr Sunak - who is known for cultivating his brand - said the UK 'must endure and live with the uncertainty of the moment' and that means 'learning our new limits' but he insisted 'our lives can no longer be put on hold'.</p>

<p>He will hope the package will help persuade Britons that the government has a plan to rescue the country's economy from ruin, and to burnish his growing reputation as the Tory party’s brightest young prospect. </p>
