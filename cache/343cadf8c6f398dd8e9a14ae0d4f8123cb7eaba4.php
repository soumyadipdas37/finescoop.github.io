<p>North Korea has executed five Economic Ministry workers after they criticised Kim Jong-Un's policies, according to reports</p>

<p>The five men, who had been attending a dinner party, had openly discussed the stagnant economy in the militarised nation state as well as the need for industrial reform as it continues to produce few consumer goods for its impoverished citizens. </p>

<p>It was reported that the employees had also spoken about the need for North Korea to seek foreign co-operation in order to overcome looming trade sanctions, according to DailyNK. </p>

<p>The outlet said that the heads of the Economic Ministry, as well as Kim Jong-Un himself, were told about the comments before authorities launched an internal investigation.  </p>

<p>It is believed that the unsuspecting workers were summoned to a meeting before they were arrested, forced to confess to undermining the regime, and executed.</p>

<p>Daily NK also said that their families were transferred to a political camp in Yodeok, Hamgyeongnam-do, which is notorious for housing political dissidents.</p>

<p>The alleged executions have prompted fears that the purges have returned after initially sweeping through the country in 2011 following former the death of Supreme Leader Kim Jong-il.</p>

<p>It comes after it was reported that Kim Jong-Un displayed his uncle's head after executing the powerful general by firing squad.</p>
