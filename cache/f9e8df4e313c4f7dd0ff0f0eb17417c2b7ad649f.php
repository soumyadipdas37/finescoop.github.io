<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Caffeine lovers with deep pockets are being invited to buy the UK's most expensive coffee at £50 for a cup of filter brew. </p>

<p>Queens of Mayfair, on Queen Street, Mayfair, has just 15 servings available of the Ethiopian 'Cup of Excellence', which is made from rare beans that recently sold for £2,000 per kilogram at auction.</p>

<p>The coffee shop, found in London's poshest district, is selling the drink on a first come, first served basis - with the £50 price tag getting customers either one large or two small cups for sharing.</p>

<p>The cafe's roaster, Difference Coffee - which processes and supplies the beans, was one of only two British buyers, with just eight businesses being invited to the auction in June this year.</p>

<p>With an industry grading of 94 out of 95 and having won this year's 'Cup of Excellence' contest - a competition between suppliers from across the world, the steep cost is perhaps of little surprise.</p>

<p>Grounded by hand, the beans are then brewed in a special v60 filter - which allows the coffee to flow through extremely slowly thanks to the fine paper used. </p>

<p>The finished product is enjoyed in a crystal wine glass and the flavour is said to develop and intensify as the coffee cools.</p>

<p>It's said to boast a light, fruity and floral flavour and guests will be served by Queens' head barista, Sabrina Pastano, who is an authorised Speciality Coffee Association trainer.</p>

<p>Thanks to a Fairtrade deal, the Ethiopian farmers of the coffee will get the full auction price for their beans. </p>
