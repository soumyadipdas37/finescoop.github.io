<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United and Manchester City have expressed their disappointment in Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden after the pair broke strict quarantine rules with England by inviting girls back to their hotel in Iceland. </p>

<p>Both players made their senior debuts for the Three Lions in the 1-0 Nations League win on Saturday, but have now been sent home by manager Gareth Southgate after images - published by Icelandic outlet DV - appeared to show Foden and Greenwood disregard strict COVID-19 protocols on Sunday. </p>

<p>The pair's conduct in bringing girls back also broke the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty.</p>

<p>Manchester United released a statement expressing their disappointment in Greenwood </p>

<p>In a statement, Manchester United said they were left 'extremely disappointed' by the behaviour of Mason Greenwood, who has enjoyed a breakthrough campaign with the Red Devils and had been rewarded with his first call-up. </p>

<p>Sportsmail understands United will wait for the facts to be established before deciding whether to take any disciplinary action against the 18-year-old. </p>

<p>The club believe that there will be no need for Greenwood to quarantine given there are no current travel restrictions with Iceland. They are, however, expected to make a decision over his return to training in due course.</p>

<p>United feel Greenwood will not have to quarantine as there are no restrictions in Iceland </p>

<p>A United spokesman said: 'Manchester United are liaising with the Football Association and are disappointed with the actions of Mason Greenwood over this situation.'</p>

<p>Manchester City issued a separate statement, calling Phil Foden's conduct 'totally inappropriate' and said it fell well short of what was expected at the club.</p>

<p>'Manchester City FC are aware of the story which has emerged today from the England national team camp in relation to the behaviour of Phil Foden,' it read.</p>

<p>Manchester City released a separate statement called Phil Foden's action's 'inappropriate'</p>

<p>Foden, above with Man City boss Pep Guardiola, has a two-year-old son and a girlfriend </p>

<p>'We have also seen the comments from England manager Gareth Southgate. It is clear that Phil’s actions were totally inappropriate.</p>

<p>'His behaviour not only directly contravenes strict guidelines related to Covid-19, but also falls well below the standard expected of a Manchester City player and England international.</p>

<p>'The club supports the FA regarding this incident, and officials from the club are now in touch in relation to Phil’s enforced early return to the UK.</p>

<p>'We have no further comment to make on this matter.'</p>

<p>Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May. </p>

<p>England boss Gareth Southgate said the pair had been 'naive' but knew they had crossed a line</p>

<p>Speaking at Monday's press conference, England boss Gareth Southgate condemned the pairs' actions, saying they had been 'naive' but that they both understand they crossed the line. </p>

<p>'Obviously they have been naive, we have dealt with it appropriately. I recognise their age but the whole world is dealing with this pandemic. </p>

<p>'These are two boys I don't know particularly well at the moment so can't speak in great depth. I have got to try and speak with them later in the appropriate way. They have got responsibilities and they have apologised. </p>

<p>'The two boys are going to find themselves in a position where there will be lots of judgement of them from afar. They understand they have got this wrong. Our job is to get on with the game.' </p>
