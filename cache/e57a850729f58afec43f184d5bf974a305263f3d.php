<p>'It's gone from bad to worse!' Rumours are swirling that The Veronicas will be on the judging panel for next year's season of The Voice on Channel Seven - but not everyone is happy</p>

<p>'Who wants to see The Veronicas?' Fans flocked to Facebook earlier this week, begging Seven to consider other local singers for the 2021 series</p>

<p>Seven has confirmed that its version of The Voice Australia in 2021 will be a 'more efficient and cost-effective production' than the show produced by Nine.</p>

<p>As a result, it's believed next year's panel will not feature any international stars, and will instead consist solely of local musicians. </p>

<p>When reports surfaced on Monday that Seven was potentially considering The Veronicas, longtime fans of the show were less than impressed.</p>

<p>'The Veronicas, seriously?' one furious viewer wrote, as others pleaded: 'Please not the Veronicas!'</p>

<p>'Surely they can do better': Angry viewers suggested there must be 'better options' available</p>

<p>'It's gone from bad to worse,' one viewer said of the proposed changes, as others insisted they felt sorry for longtime judge Delta Goodrem. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, several commenters suggested there must be 'better options' available.</p>

<p>Seven is yet to confirm what will happen to incumbent Aussie judges Guy Sebastian and Delta Goodrem.</p>

<p>It was reported last month that Nine had 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'. </p>

<p>Channel Seven's CEO, James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'.</p>

<p>Warburton already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.</p>

<p>'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.</p>
