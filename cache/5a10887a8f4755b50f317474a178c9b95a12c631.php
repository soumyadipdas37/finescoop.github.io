<p>Never forget: Friday was the 19th anniversary of the terrorist attacks by al-Qaeda on the United States. And Kaia Gerber's new boyfriend Jacob Elordi seemed to give a nod to 9/11 as he wore a Peace Is Power sweatshirt after visiting a NYC gym</p>

<p>Kaia looked at her tall boyfriend as they walked in step in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City.</p>

<p>The Malibu native had on a light grey sweatshirt that read Notre Dame. It is not sure why she chose that sweatshirt as her father Rande Gerber attended University Of Arizona and her mother Cindy Crawford dropped out of Northwestern University to launch her modeling career.</p>

<p>Kaia added black micro shorts by Alo and wore white New Balance sneakers with white socks. She added a face mask and blue NY cap while a brown purse rested on her shoulder.</p>
