<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A video circulating on social media reveals the disgusting dirt lurking in plain sight on dark coloured upholstery.</p>

<p>The clip, originally shared in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook, shows a woman rubbing the backseat of her car with a Bissell 'Proheat Revolution' carpet cleaner.</p>

<p>While the seats are not visibly stained, the plastic container on the back of the machine quickly fills with murky brown water - proving the horrifying amount of grime embedded in the fabric. </p>

<p>'B****y disgusting! This is just a general clean, there wasn't anything spilled or any really visible stains - just 10 years of filth,' the woman wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>While the seats are not visibly stained, the container on the back of the machine quickly fills with murky brown water (pictured) - proving the amount of grime embedded in the fabric</p>

<p>People were quick to respond to the video, with some expressing horror while others admitted they found the footage 'satisfying' to watch.</p>

<p>'Disgusting, but awesome,' one woman replied.</p>

<p>'Oh dear… but so very satisfying,' said a second, while a third added: 'This is disgusting. I love it.'</p>

<p>Others said they had discovered similar levels of filth on what they believed to be 'clean' furniture and soft furnishings.</p>

<p>'I've just finished my house, rugs and car and was disgusted with the dirt it pulled out. I thought I was a clean person until then!' said one woman.</p>

<p>Another felt equally ashamed, writing: 'I did this to my car and was mortified.'</p>

<p>And it's not the only home cleaning horror that's been revealed on social media in recent weeks.</p>

<p>The woman said there were no spillages on the seats, 'just 10 years of filth' lurking in plain sight</p>

<p>In August, a self-professed 'clean freak' was disgusted after making a grim discovery under the drain of here kitchen sink.</p>

<p>After watching a tutorial on household cleanliness, the woman asked her husband to prise off the stainless steel ring sealed over the pipe - only to find the plastic beneath was encased in a grotesque layer of congealed dirt.</p>

<p>Sickened by the sight, she posted photos in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook to warn others about what lies beneath the seemingly spotless base of the sink.</p>

<p>'I'm a clean freak but I was nearly [vomiting] when I saw what was in there,' she wrote in the caption. 'Just disgusting but all clean now and siliconed (sic) back in place.'</p>

<p>What lies beneath: An Australian woman was horrified after discovering thick layers of congealed dirt stuck to the plastic of her sink</p>

<p>The woman deep cleaned the plastic covering (right) and warned others to do the same</p>

<p>The woman said she scoured the plastic with Gumption multipurpose cleaning paste, which is sold in leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths for $5.40. </p>

<p>Hundreds replied to the post, expressing their revulsion and pledging to investigate their own drains without delay.</p>

<p>'I never knew we can unscrew [drain coverings], I didn't even know it builds up dirt like this,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I've been living in my house for three years and I'm so scared to do mine now, I can't imagine what I will find in there.'</p>

<p>Another said she is 'now officially terrified' of her sink, joking: 'Will have to get hubby to do all the dishes now. What a shame for me.'</p>
