<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Step inside Tickton Grange and you’ll spot a framed local newspaper cutting from 1981, the day it opened as a country house hotel. </p>

<p>The article tells the story of how this handsome but derelict Georgian house with four acres, in Tickton, near Beverley, was lavishly restored by the Whymant family.</p>

<p>Today, siblings Paul, Helen and Maggy are at the helm, steering ‘our home’ through these tricky times. </p>

<p>Pictured is the grand library, which has a bar and David Hockney paintings on the wall</p>

<p>Still, the purchase of an adjacent farm now affords guests 20 acres of gardens, woodland and wild meadows, while the farm buildings converted last year into a wedding venue were in full celebratory swing on a warm Saturday in July.</p>

<p>The vibe is relaxed but the decor alludes to its grand past – Edward VII played cards here (now Room Four). Guests are welcomed from ‘sunrise to sunset’ with clever menus, whether a cafetiere with fennel biscuits taken in the gardens, a two-course lunch in Hide restaurant (£25) or House Aperos – delicious hot and cold bites served in the evening with an Aperol spritz (£25).</p>

<p>Stroll in the lavender-filled gardens where Paul’s son Sam has created wildflower meadows and discover the summer pavilion where couples exchange vows.</p>

<p>The real jewel is the library with a bar, all stuffed velvets and rosy colours enhanced by David Hockneys on the wall (try to spot the fakes, if you can tear yourself away from the macaroons). Afternoon tea is the crowd-pleaser here, served on their own design Royal Derby china.</p>

<p>A few hours later and Hide restaurant was hushed with date-night locals and celebration diners, relaxing at the large tables and gazing out of the Palladian windows.</p>

<p>Afternoon tea is a 'crowd-pleaser' and is served on the hotel's own design Royal Derby china</p>

<p>Tickton Grange Country House Hotel, Beverley, East Yorkshire. B&amp;B doubles from £140 a night. For more information visit ticktongrange.co.uk. </p>

<p>In 2019, Beverley was voted one of the best places to live in the UK, having outgrown its reputation as a ‘miniature York’. It ticks every box for a bustling market town and has an imposing Minster.</p>

<p>If you only need one reason to check in here, make it for the full Yorkshire breakfast.</p>

<p>It is immaculate and piping hot – from taut little vine tomatoes to the local sausage, fried bread and black pudding, washed down with the best cup ever of Yorkshire tea. I ask Paul how simple ingredients can taste so good, and he shrugs with a smile: ‘It’s just what we do.’</p>

<p>Rooms: There are 21 ranging from intimate (compact) to elegant (bigger) and two suites plus four rooms in the Granary (great for families). Expect richly textured fabrics and modern traditional furnishings.</p>

<p>USP: Family attentiveness.</p>

<p>Food: Whether a prettily dainty afternoon tea, pork belly, Lincolnshire prawn, coconut &amp; pea – one of seven courses on the tasting dinner menu, or breakfast, there is a serious kitchen here. </p>
