<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father-of-two has revealed how he was able to kick his heroin and ice addictions following a daring prison escape, three overdoses and countless stints in rehab.</p>

<p>Danny Shannon grew up in stable household with a loving mother in Cabramatta, in Sydney's west, but after dabbling with marijuana and LSD at 14 his life 'spiralled out of control'.  </p>

<p>Mr Shannon became hooked on heroin when he was 16, before eventually turning to ice and landing himself behind bars by the time he was 18 after a string of drug-related offences. </p>

<p>'I've gone from being a happy, good kid from a good background and once I started using drugs, I never stopped,' he told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>

<p>When he was 25, Mr Shannon famously escaped from Sydney's Silverwater prison and fled all the way to Perth along with fellow inmate Patrick Page.</p>

<p>Danny Shannon, 45, has revealed how he was able to kick his heroin and ice addictions following a daring prison escape, three overdoses and countless stints in rehab </p>

<p>Mr Shannon said his jailbreak was spurred on by a large sum of money he had hidden on the outside, and his eagerness to see his girlfriend, who was pregnant with their son. </p>

<p>'I called her and I said "if you could see me tonight would it be okay?" It was like I wanted her permission [to escape],' he said.</p>

<p>'I had money stashed outside I was itching to get my hands on. So I managed to scale a four-metre high barbed-wire fence.'  </p>

<p>The pair used garbage bin handles and rags to scale a five metre barbed-wire fence - before swimming through a shark-infested river.   </p>

<p>'By the time we got down to Parramatta River, the water police and POLAIR were onto us,' Mr Shannon said.</p>

<p>'It was like a miracle. I don't know how the f**k we got away. I was climbing through mangroves and mud up to my neck for hours to get out of the river.'</p>

<p>Mr Shannon eventually arrived to his then-partner's house and grabbed his stash of money before they both made their way to Western Australia.  </p>

<p>The father-of-two lasted six days on the run before police busted down his door at a hotel in Perth. </p>

<p>'I got pinched on Valentine's Day with my partner when police raided our hotel room,' he said.  </p>

<p>Mr Shannon became hooked on heroin when he was 16, before eventually turning to ice and landing himself behind bars by the time he was 18 after a string of drug-related offences</p>

<p>He spent the next decade or so in and out of jail and rehab, checking himself in at least 50 times.</p>

<p>But after years of failing to shake his addictions, Mr Shannon made the life-changing decision in 2009 to check himself into Glebe House.</p>

<p>'That was a turning point in my entire life. I haven't really come close to using drugs since that day,' he said. </p>

<p>'I thought to myself that there's been maybe 100 times where I've been in that same position when I've thrown it all away.</p>

<p>'For some miracle reason I was brave and strong enough and made a different decision for the first time in my life, and I've never looked back.'    </p>

<p>Mr Shannon has now been clean for 11 years, and said he hopes his experiences can serve as a lesson to others. Pictured with his daughter, 3</p>

<p>While Mr Shannon (right) works every single day on his sobriety, he said he isn't 'triggered' by thoughts of turning back to drugs</p>

<p>Mr Shannon, who is a father to a 19-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, started his own virtual time capsule company Encapsulator 10 years ago to document his progress</p>

<p>Mr Shannon has been working at Glebe House - a community to help men transition to a life free from addiction - for over 10 years now.</p>

<p>'I now represent a symbol of hope for so many people going through exactly what I did for over a decade,' he said.  </p>

<p>While Mr Shannon works every single day on his sobriety, he said he isn't 'triggered' by thoughts of turning back to drugs.</p>

<p>'The thought of it makes me sick. I work really hard everyday on my recovery program, and have been doing it everyday for 11 years,' he said. </p>

<p>'It's not a chore but I work my a*** off on maintaining my sobriety by giving back and giving a lot of service to other people.' </p>

<p>Mr Shannon, who is a father to a 19-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, started his own virtual time capsule company 10 years ago to document his progress.</p>

<p>'When I celebrated five years' clean this idea popped into my head to record a message to my 10 year birthday of sobriety,' he said. </p>

<p>'I realised it was such a unique, therapeutic and self-reflective practice. I discovered a real experience in creating a video message to my future self.'</p>

<p>Mr Shannon said his company Encapsulator records his client's messages to their future selves.</p>

<p>'You can choose any day in the future you want to lock your content until. When you record your video it disappears until the date you've selected,' he said. </p>

<p>'I'm a nostalgic person, and it's perfect for measuring growth.' </p>
