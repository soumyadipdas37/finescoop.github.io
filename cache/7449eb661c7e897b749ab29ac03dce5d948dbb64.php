<p>At least four people have been stabbed close to the former headquarters of Charlie Hebdo magazine in Paris</p>

<p>It comes as a trial takes place in the French capital concerned with the January 2015 attacks that shocked the world.</p>

<p>They saw three gunmen linked to Al-Qaeda and Islamic State travel around the Paris slaughtering 15 civilians and two serving police officers at will.</p>

<p>Their primary targets were staff at Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine which had published a series of cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>The principal terrorists – who were all known to the French security services – were all gunned down by police themselves, but 14 defendants in the current trial facing life in prison for 'complicity in terrorism'.</p>

<p>More to follow. </p>
