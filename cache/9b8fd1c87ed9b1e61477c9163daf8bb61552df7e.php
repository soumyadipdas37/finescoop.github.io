<p>The video was filmed at a wedding in the northeastern Mexican state of Nuevo Leon earlier this month.</p>

<p>The video goes on to show the rest of the venue as the just-married couple is also seen enjoying a dance, but, unlike their guests, were not confined to a box or wearing face masks.</p>

<p>The Mexican 'epidemiological traffic light' system was created to notify locals which state of emergency they are in depending on the number of people hospitalised due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>It goes from green to yellow to orange to red in order of how serious the situation is at the time.</p>

<p>The new status will allow citizens to have celebrations such as weddings or quinceaneras, but are required to follow the social distancing guidelines maintaining 5 feet between guests.</p>

<p>Venues will also be expected to keep their capacity at 30 percent or less and guests should wear their face masks all the time.</p>

<p>According to the latest figures from Johns Hopkins University Mexico has reported 697,663 cases of the virus leading to 73,493 deaths.</p>
