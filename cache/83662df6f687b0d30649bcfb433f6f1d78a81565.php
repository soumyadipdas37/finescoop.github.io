<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool have 'reached an agreement with Watford for Ismaila Sarr worth between £32-36million'.  </p>

<p>The Reds have already secured the signings of Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota for a combined £65m but remain interested in the Senegal winger. </p>

<p>According to France Football, Sarr's agents have met with Liverpool officials and a deal has been agreed with Watford that could reach £36m. </p>

<p>Watford's Ismaila Sarr remains of interest to Liverpool and they have reportedly agreed a fee</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has already brought in three players but may yet further add to his resources</p>

<p>A contract worth £120,000-a-week has also been discussed but terms are yet to be agreed.  </p>

<p>The 22-year-old is also of interest to Everton and Manchester United and the report also states that Aston Villa have entered the race, believing the lure of first team football could swing things in their favour. </p>

<p>After a quiet transfer window aside from the addition of Konstantinos Tsimikas for £11.75million from Olympiacos, Liverpool sprung into life in the past few days. </p>

<p>Thiago and Jota have joined the ranks but France Football insist that the Anfield outfit are not finished. </p>

<p>Klopp wants Ousmane Dembele on loan but Barcelona are keen for a permanent deal </p>

<p>Sarr scored twice against Liverpool when Watford beat the Reds last season </p>

<p>They are understood to be interested in signing Ousmane Dembele from Barcelona but are chasing a loan deal. </p>

<p>The Catalan side want a permanent transfer for the French international winger so at this stage the move is unlikely. </p>

<p>Klopp is conscious of bringing in competition for Liverpool's front three of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane. </p>

<p>Jota will provide just that with Sarr and Dembele representing more depth in the attacking third for the Premier League champions if they can secure one or both. </p>

<p>Liverpool have made the perfect start to their title defence with a 4-3 win over Leeds followed by Sunday's 2-0 victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.  </p>

<p>Liverpool already boosted their front-line depth with the £45million signing of Diogo Jota </p>
