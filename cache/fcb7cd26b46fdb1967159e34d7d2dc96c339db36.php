<p>Wanyama, 29, said: 'My attention has been drawn to a video circulating online containing false, fabricated and insulting allegations aimed at scandalising my good name and reputation.</p>

<p>'I wish to distance myself completely from the contents of this defamatory video.</p>

<p>'The allegations made therein are a total fabrication and a figment of the maker's imagination at best. I have NEVER met any party in the video.</p>

<p>'I strongly condemn the actions of both the woman in the video and the publisher of the video Arthur Mandela via his Instagram account <?php echo e('@'); ?>Xtiandela for encouraging the disparagement of character of individuals based on false accusatory statements.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old made the allegations during an Instagram Live interview with blogger Mandela</p>

<p>'The allegations made are manifestly fictitious clearly meant to boost the online audience of both the maker and of the insulting allegations and publisher of the video.'</p>

<p>Wanyama's statement continued: 'I have worked long and hard to build my character and standing in the society.</p>

<p>'Such malicious, scandalising and false assertions about my name and character are UNACCEPTABLE to me, my family and institutions who have placed great trust in me.</p>

<p>'I am prepared to go to great lengths to protect my good name and character.</p>

<p> Shakila claimed the Kenya captain and Montreal Impact midfielder paid her £5,000 for sex</p>

<p>'Consequently, and with the blessing of my management team, I have instructed my legal team to pursue ALL legal remedies available to me and to which I have the unreserved right to seek. That is all I wish to state.'</p>

<p>In an Instagram post, Shakila had earlier apologised to musical artist Jones for her claim.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Am being forced to do this public apology cause I damaged <?php echo e('@'); ?>khaligraph_jones public image by whatever that I said yesterday due to influence of alcohol and reverse psychology.</p>

<p>'Papa Jones am sorry. The rest mentioned were true and any claims raised will not be taken and dealt with personally.'</p>
