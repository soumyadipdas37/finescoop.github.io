<p>The trio have been promoted into the senior squad for the first time following excellent performances for their clubs post-lockdown.</p>

<p>As revealed by Sportsmail this morning, Southgate has named an extended 30 man squad for the games against Wales, Belgium and Denmark amid fatigue concerns for a number of players.</p>

<p>Everton forward Dominic Calvert-Lewin has been called-up for England for the very first time</p>

<p>Arsenal youngster Bukayo Saka and Leicester's Harvey Barnes are also handed debut call-ups </p>

<p>England manager Gareth Southgate has named his squad for three international fixtures</p>

<p>In contrast, Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden have been dropped following their Iceland team hotel shame.</p>

<p>Greenwood, 18, and Foden, 20, were dropped for the away clash at Denmark last month after sneaking girls into the team hotel in Iceland, breaking strict covid-bubble protocols in the process. </p>

<p>Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden (pictured) broke protocols after they snuck girls into their hotel room in Iceland, breaking their Covid-19 bubble</p>

<p>The pair have now been dropped from Southgate's latest squad for the games this month</p>

<p>But Harry Maguire has been recalled after being found guilty on three operate counts following an incident involving police on the Greek island of Mykonos in August</p>

<p>Goalkeepers: Dean Henderson, Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope</p>

<p>Defenders: Trent Alexander-Arnold, Ben Chilwell, Conor Coady, Eric Dier, Joe Gomez, Michael Keane, Harry Maguire, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Tyrone Mings, Bukayo Saka, Kieran Trippier, Kyle Walker</p>

<p>Forwards: Tammy Abraham, Harvey Barnes, Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Jack Grealish, Danny Ings, Harry Kane, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Raheem Sterling </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there's also a return for Ben Chilwell and Jordan Henderson, who missed September's matches due to injury.  </p>

<p>Other notable inclusions are Gunners defender Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Wolves skipper Conor Coady, Leeds midfielder Kalvin Phillips and Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish, who all retain their places following their first call-ups in September. </p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin has been picked this month after five games in his first three Premier League matches, as well as a hat-trick in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night.  </p>

<p>On picking the Premier League's joint-top scorer Calvert-Lewin, Southgate said: 'He's been in the pathway through the U21s, had a good season last season.</p>

<p>'A lot of Dominic's game I've liked for a long time, what he's adding now is the goals that haven't always been there and in the last 18 months or so he has really improved in that area.</p>

<p>'He's been a big part of Everton's starting the season as well as they have and I'm very pleased to be able to call him up for the first time.'</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin, 23, admitted it was a 'dream come true' to be called-up to the senior England squad, saying: 'I'm a very, very proud man to get this first England call.</p>

<p>'I phoned my mum and my dad, and my mum burst into tears.</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin has scored eight goals in all competitions already this season for Everton</p>

<p>'It's something we've spoken about since I was a young boy. To get here now and get the call-up is a dream come true. I'm very happy.'</p>

<p>England have three matches in this international break, starting with a friendly against Wales at Wembley on October 8.  </p>

<p>Southgate's side then face Belgium on October 11 and Denmark on October 14 at Wembley in the UEFA Nations League.   </p>
