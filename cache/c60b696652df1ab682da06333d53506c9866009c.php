<p>Whatever it takes! Lala Kent joked that she yanked out her IUD to follow through with a pregnancy pact with a few of her reality television co-stars, including Stassi Schroeder, Brittany Cartwright and Katie Maloney; seen on Instagram</p>

<p>Kent revealed that Stassi was the one to get the ball rolling after her wedding to Beau Clark was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a similar situation to what Lala was experiencing with her fiance Randall Emmett.</p>

<p>'I'm talking to her and she smiles and says, 'I'm pregnant,' like, "Y'all need to get it poppin,"' Lala remembered. 'So I called Rand and I was like, "It doesn't matter when the wedding is happening, we're yanking my IUD out!"'</p>

<p>Schroeder announced she's expecting a baby girl with her fiance earlier this year and Brittany Cartwright recently revealed she's due to have a baby boy with husband Jax Taylor.</p>

<p>The rumors of a pregnancy pact began earlier this year when Brittany said that babies were on everyone's minds.</p>

<p>'We all talk about it, all four of us — me, Katie, Stassi, Lala — we always say that we have a pregnancy pact,' she told Entertainment Tonight in February. 'We want to have babies around the same time, so we are all trying to make it work.'</p>

<p>'We are all transplants to California, our friends are our family,' Jax added. 'For us to have kids around the same time and to grow up together, that is a big deal.' </p>

<p>While most of the women in the pact have started their journey into motherhood, Katie Maloney admitted she's working to get into the club, too.</p>

<p>'I'm so happy for my friends and really enjoying being along for their journey. It will happen for us when it's right,' she wrote. 'Sometimes it just takes time and doesn't always happen the first try.'</p>

<p>Notably absent from Brittany and Jax's gender reveal party over the weekend were his best man and former best friends, Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix.</p>

<p>Ariana took to Instagram to reveal her bare stomach and joked: 'not pregnant just bloated and starved for attention.'</p>

<p>She added: 'Some of y’all are completely devoid of humor and think everything is ‘shade’ but I guess I got that attention I was desperate for anyway. BTW it’s a bean and cheese burrito and Del Taco is the father.'</p>

<p>Kristen Doute was on hand at Jax and Brittany's big reveal with her new boyfriend, Alex Menache, and seems to be making her way back into good graces with her friends after a difficult falling out on the last season of the popular Bravo program.</p>
