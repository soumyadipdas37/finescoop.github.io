<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A record number of migrants reached Britain by illegally crossing the Channel last month, it has been confirmed. </p>

<p>More than 1,450 arrived by small boats in August, bringing the total since the start of the year to more than 5,000. Just 1,850 migrants made the journey in 2019. </p>

<p>The massive rise comes despite a vow from Home Secretary Priti Patel last autumn to have made the crossings an ‘infrequent phenomenon’ by this point. </p>

<p>The Home Office has sought to blame French authorities and ‘activist lawyers’ for the increase and for difficulties removing asylum seekers once they arrive in Britain. </p>

<p>A group of people thought to be migrants are brought into Dover, Kent, by Border Force officers following a small boat incident in the Channel</p>

<p>About 100 migrants were seen arriving in the port of Dover yesterday, with at least 15 small boats reaching British shores. </p>

<p>The daily total included women and children, as well as three men on an inflatable kayak. </p>

<p>One woman in her 20s was seen being brought ashore by Border Force officers in a wheelchair.  </p>

<p>Others were brought into Dover aboard the UK Border Force patrol boat Hunter. </p>

<p>They were seen being ushered out of the cabin on to the stern of the vessel where they were given life jackets. </p>

<p>Immigration officials then helped them ashore one by one and escorted them up the gangway. </p>

<p>More than 1,450 arrived by small boats in August, bringing the total since the start of the year to more than 5,000. Just 1,850 migrants made the journey in 2019</p>

<p>A dinghy believed to have been used to cross the Channel was seen being towed into the harbour shortly afterwards. </p>

<p>Later, more arrivals believed to be migrants were seen coming into the port, sitting on the front of an RNLI lifeboat. </p>

<p>About a dozen in life jackets were helped ashore, where they were met by border officials. </p>

<p>The previous monthly record for migrant arrivals was 1,075, set in July. August’s arrivals saw 235 reach Britain on just one day – which was also a record.</p>

<p> Miss Patel is seeking a deal with French authorities that would allow migrant boats to be turned back in the Channel. No agreement has yet been reached. </p>

<p>Yesterday, the Mail revealed the taxpayer was hit with a £1billion bill for the asylum system last year.</p>
