<p>Code: Despite the results of The Bachelor leaking early into the season, Locky Gilbert and winner Irena Srbinovska still used codenames to communicate with each other in secret</p>

<p>'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky admitted, referring to the moniker he used to save Irena's number in his phone.</p>

<p>'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena revealed.</p>

<p>'Douglas is Locky’s middle name so that’s where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' she explained.</p>

<p> Locky added: 'I have no idea where Roger came from, I just thought it was funny!'</p>

<p>Revealed: 'Mine was as simple as Roger Roger and it had a smiley face,' Locky admitted. 'And Locky was under Doug in my phone,' Irena added</p>

<p>During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella and Irene that he was in love with them - but then had the tricky task of sending one home.</p>

<p>He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.</p>

<p>'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.</p>

<p>'Douglas is Locky’s middle name so that’s where I got it from and no one picked up on that!' Irena explained</p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'</p>

<p>As Locky tried to explain himself, a furious Bella stormed off and snapped: 'My God... Can I leave? I'm going.'</p>

<p>She later told producers: 'Who does that to someone? Who tells them they're in love with them and then... I just want to get out of here.'</p>

<p>Finale: During Thursday night's gut-wrenching finale, Locky told both Bella and Irene that he was in love with them - but ultimately sent Bella packing </p>

<p>After this emotional break-up, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena , telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her.</p>

<p>'Irena, every time I'm with you, I feel so safe and protected. It's kind of weird, because I'm a pretty big dude, and not many people can make me feel like that,' he told the 31-year-old nurse.</p>

<p>'But just when I'm with you, I feel so calm and comfortable, and it's a pretty new feeling for me. I know you're going to make a beautiful girlfriend, wife, mother, everything. You're the whole package.'</p>

<p>The end! After his emotional break-up with Bella, Locky composed himself then professed his love for Irena (left), telling her he couldn't wait to spend the rest of his life with her</p>
