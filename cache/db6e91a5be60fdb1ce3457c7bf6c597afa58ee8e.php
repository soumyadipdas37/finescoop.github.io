<p>Wolves have confirmed the signing of Portuguese wonderkid Fabio Silva in a record deal</p>

<p>The teenager has been given the No.17 shirt and was officially unveiled at Molineux</p>

<p>Silva had a £112million buy out clause  in his Porto contract, but the Portuguese giants have been forced to consider substantially lower offers following the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Wolves took delight in introducing the new boy to their supporters, using a promotional video which alluded to the repeated comparisons made between Silva and Portugal legend Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>

<p>Silva became the youngest player to represent Porto when he made his first team debut last year aged 17 years and 22 days.  </p>

<p>Wolves chairman Jeff Shi has revealed the 18-year-old has been watched for some time, and that Wolves feel they could not have identified a better player.</p>

<p>'Our recruitment team have been watching Fabio since he played for Portugal under-16s and they feel he has always been the best number nine coming through his age group anywhere in Europe,' Shi told the club's website.</p>

<p>'Fabio has the potential to be a generational talent and for us to see him develop under Nuno is very exciting. He is the type of player our fans will love </p>
