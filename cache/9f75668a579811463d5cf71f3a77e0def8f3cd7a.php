<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Even by the modern means of staring down the barrel of a Zoom at Andy Murray it was easy to tell that he was not happy.</p>

<p>After being comprehensively dismantled by 20 year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime in the US Open second round he sat before a camera in the virtual interview room of Flushing Meadows, exuding a sense of hurt pride</p>

<p>His 6-2 6-3 6-4 defeat had been the first time since 2006 that he had lost in straight sets during a Grand Slam.</p>

<p>Andy Murray lost in straight sets for the first time in a Grand Slam on Thursday evening</p>

<p>Murray was beaten by 20 year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime (above) in round two of the US Open</p>

<p>For all of Murray's reduced state, exacerbated by having played such a marathon first round, it was clearly not a comfortable feeling, which is perhaps a positive sign as he moves into the final phase of his career.</p>

<p>The sting of managing to force a single break point will have been particularly painful, against an opponent whose serve he had picked out as a potential weakness before the match.</p>

<p>Mixed in with the annoyance at himself was also a hint of resignation.</p>

<p>'I might as well shoot for the stars,' said Murray. 'And if I don't get there, then that's all right. But I'm trying my best to get the most out of what my body gives me now.'</p>

<p>The Briton believes it will be tough to win another Grand Slam but he will keep on trying</p>

<p>He did not indulge in the diversionary tactic of praising his young conqueror to the hilt, although he would have been justified in extolling just what an outstanding prospect 6' 4' Auger-Aliassime is.</p>

<p>Murray certainly did not go as far as the interpretation of Greg Rusedski (who also spent his formative years in Quebec), commenting on Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>'If he can continue this sort of tennis for the rest of the tournament he could win it,' said the former British number one.</p>

<p>That might be pushing it, as the world number 21 will get more of a physical challenge from other opponents. Yet at times he was almost unplayable, reducing Murray to a spectator with winners off his serve and forehand.</p>

<p>Greg Rusedski believes 15th seedÂ Auger-Aliassime can go on and win the US Open now</p>

<p>That the 33 year-old Scot is playing at all is a triumph, but he will not be wanting to make up the numbers when it comes to the Majors.</p>

<p>It could well be, however, that the biggest impact he makes for what is left of his career will be in the best-of-three format of the Masters tournament level, which are the middle distance events of tennis.</p>

<p>The exception would be Wimbledon, where matches are less of a grind and his skills on grass should remain superior to so many other players.</p>

<p>The reality is that, even without his well-documented hip problems, he is of a relatively advanced age. His body type is very different to that with which his direct contemporary Novak Djokovic has been blessed, a wiry frame that should support him to a few more Major titles.</p>

<p>Murray said that, despite the heavy defeat, he was departing the New York bubble with a sense of encouragement.</p>

<p>Murray is encouraged despite the defeat in New York and can take some pride from displays</p>

<p>'Even after tonight I'm more positive about what I could do in Grand Slams than I was before I came over here. I played a couple of tough matches in the 'Cincinnati' tournament, and I played certainly one very tough match here, and my right hip felt good. That's really, really positive.'</p>

<p>He now plans to ease himself onto the clay, playing on it for the first time since 2017. He will go straight to the French Open, rather than attempt one of the lead-up events that have been added to the calendar, for its scheduled September 27 start.</p>

<p>Lesson one for Paris will be to try and avoid the ponderous start and sapping first round match that was such compelling viewing, but sealed his fate in New York. This will be easier said than done.</p>
