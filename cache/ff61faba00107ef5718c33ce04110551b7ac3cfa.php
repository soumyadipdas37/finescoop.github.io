<p>The former Sydney Roosters and Rabbitohs captain, 51, has opened up about his 20-year-old business Garlo's Pies.</p>

<p>Garlick said the company has been lucky to grow during the COVID-19 pandemic despite pubs, clubs, schools, cafes and sports ground sales dropping.</p>

<p>Former NRL star Sean Garlick went from selling pies out of a small Sydney bakery to shipping containers of product overseas and growing his company into a $20million empire</p>

<p>Supermarket sales went 'through the roof' because people started panic-buying pies to keep in freezers 'in case Armageddon came along'.</p>

<p>Since opening a small storefront in Maroubra in the city's east in 2001 alongside his brother Nathan, the family-owned company now distributes pies to 650 stores nationally.</p>

<p>'The only person who knew anything about pies back then was my brother, Nathan, who was a pastry cook. When we opened our first pie shop at Maroubra, not only did we not know how to run a business, we didn't even know anyone who had run a business,' Garlick told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>When he finished his NRL career Garlick worked as a football manager with the Rabbitohs and made pies on the side with his brother.</p>

<p>But when the store quickly became successful he went into it full time and opened 13 pie shops in five years across Sydney.</p>

<p>They had locations in Mascot, Coogee, Bondi Junction, Marrickville, Eastgardens, Manly, Liverpool, Parramatta, Blacktown and Enmore.</p>

<p>Now their biggest customers are Coles and Woolworths, and Garlo's even supplies to Costco.</p>

<p>'We export to five countries - Japan, that's out biggest, we're in a supermarket chain over there, UAE - Abu-Dhabi and Dubai — Hong Kong, New Zealand and we go to some Pacific Islands,' Garlick said.</p>

<p>Up to 100 staff, including nine full-time family members, make up to 80,000 pies per day.</p>

<p>'It's funny, we used to sell pies one at a time. I then used to think we were killing it when we would sell them by the box when we went to wholesale,' the managing director said. </p>

<p>Garlick's son and Bachelor star Jackson also works as a marketing executive for the family business.     </p>
