<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal have been warned they will have to substantially increase their £30m offer for Lyon midfield maestro Houssem Aouar.</p>

<p>Aouar is valued at £54m and Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas said: 'There will be very few departures, Arsenal are way too far away from his value.</p>

<p>'Ware counting on him to have a great match against Lorient and to lead Lyon into the Champions League next year.'</p>

<p>Arsenal have seen an initial bid for Lyon midfielder Houssem Aouar rejected </p>

<p>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas believes Arsenal don't have the funds required to sign Aouar</p>

<p>And football.london are reporting that the Gunners will now significantly increase their offer for the player after seeing their initial bid rejected last week.</p>

<p>Aouar, a France Under 21 international, has spent his entire career to date at Lyon, making over 130 appearances for the club.</p>

<p>Arsenal have improved immensely under Arteta but they are certainly in need of a player who can create chances with regularity, especially with Mesut Ozil having been frozen out.</p>

<p>Arsenal have rebuffed approaches from Atletico Madrid and Torino to take Lucas Torreira on loan. Arsenal want to sell the midfielder and retain an interest in Atletico's Thomas Partey.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta is desperate to bring in a midfielder before the window closes on October 5</p>

<p>The French club are demanding a fee of £54million for the hugely talented 22-year-old</p>
