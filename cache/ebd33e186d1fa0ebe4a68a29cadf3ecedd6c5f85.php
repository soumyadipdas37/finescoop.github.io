<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Johanna Konta has split from coach Thomas Hogstedt and is out of the Italian Open after a third-round loss to Garbine Muguruza.</p>

<p>The British No 1, who reached the final in Rome last year in a breakthrough performance on clay, has had a number of close battles with Muguruza in the past but this was much more straightforward for the Spaniard, who came through 6-4, 6-1</p>

<p>Swede Hogstedt is one of the most experienced coaches on the WTA Tour, having previously worked with illustrious names like Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki.</p>

<p>Johanna Konta went down 6-4, 6-1 against Spaniard Garbine Muguruza in Rome on Friday</p>

<p>The partnership raised a few eyebrows, with former British No 1 Laura Robson describing it as a 'very weird choice' because of their respective personalities.</p>

<p>Konta batted that away but appears to have concluded that they are not the right fit after all.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Konta said: 'They were only working on a trial basis and they agreed to work together for the US swing and then assess going forward.'</p>

<p>The British No 1 revealed she has split from top coach Thomas Hogstedt (right)</p>

<p>Under Hogstedt, the British No 1 reached the semi-finals of the Western &amp; Southern Open before losing in the second round of the US Open.</p>

<p>She will now begin preparations for the French Open, which begins on September 27.</p>
