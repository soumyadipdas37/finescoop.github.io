<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>People who struggle to get a good night's sleep are significantly more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, even if they are a healthy weight.</p>

<p>A review of more than 1,000 scientific studies into diabetes found insomniacs were at a 17 per cent risk compared to good sleepers.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is linked in most cases to being overweight or obese, not doing enough exercise and consuming too much sugar.</p>

<p>But the review found even insomniacs who were a healthy weight were 7 per cent more likely to get the condition than those who sleep well.</p>

<p>Sleep deprivation causes changes to hormones that regulate hunger and appetite, which make people more prone to overeating, particularly sugary foods - which drives up the risk of obesity and diabetes. </p>

<p>Previous studies have also pointed to a faulty gene that disrupts the link between our 24 hour, or circadian, rhythms and release of the hormone insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels in check.</p>

<p>Britons are the most sleep deprived people in Europe, with around two thirds of adults admitting they do not get the recommended seven hours a night. </p>

<p>Scientists behind the study said health chiefs should heed the warnings of the findings and focus on encouraging people to get longer and better-quality sleep.</p>

<p>People who struggle to get a good night's sleep are significantly more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, even if they are a healthy weight, research suggests (file)</p>

<p>For the latest research, experts from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, carried out a literature review of 1,360 studies into type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>The studies involved about a million adults of all ages from across Europe, 74,000 of which suffered from the condition.</p>

<p>The Swedish researchers looked for preventable risk factors that may be contributing towards type 2 diabetes, which affects about 4million Britons.</p>

<p>Thousands of people with type 2 diabetes are being enrolled into an NHS trial of 'soups and shakes' diet which has been proven to reverse the illness   </p>

<p>A total of 5,000 patients in England have been signed up to trial the radical 12-month diet programme to slim them down and restore their health.</p>

<p>Volunteers will be restricted to just 800 calories per day - a third of an adult man's recommended daily intake and almost half of a woman's.</p>

<p>Their meals will be limited to blended shakes, bowls of soup and health bars for three months, before real, nutritious food is reintroduced for the remaining nine months.</p>

<p>Type 2 diabetes is linked in most cases to being overweight or obese, not doing enough exercise and consuming too much sugar. </p>

<p>The move is an expansion of a smaller trial after a 2018 study by Oxford University showed almost half of people who stuck to the soups and shakes plan saw their diabetes go into remission after a year. </p>

<p>Diabetes is estimated to cost the health service £10billion a year, while almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are for diabetes treatment.</p>

<p>The condition is also one of the biggest risk factors in coronavirus deaths, with around a third of UK Covid-19 victims also suffering from the condition.</p>

<p>They highlighted 19 preventable behaviours, habits and conditions – including overeating, smoking and drinking caffeine.</p>

<p>But the scientists said their most surprising finding was that sleep had such a significant influence on chance of type 2 diabetes – driving up the risk by almost a fifth.</p>

<p>When body mass index (BMI) was taken into consideration, the risk was reduced to 7 per cent, suggesting for many it is primarily a weight issue. </p>

<p>The research was an observational one and the team did not offer any explanation as to why insomnia was linked to the metabolic disorder, even when BMI was considered.</p>

<p>But previous studies have suggested a faulty protein called MT2, may disrupt the link between our 24 hour, or circadian, rhythms and release of the hormone insulin - leading to abnormal control of blood sugar and, hence, type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>Lead author Professor Susanna Larsson, of the Karolinska Institute, said: 'Our study confirmed several previously established risk factors and identified novel potential risk factors for type 2 diabetes using the latest summary-level data.</p>

<p>'Findings should inform public health policies for the primary prevention of type 2 diabetes.</p>

<p>'Prevention strategies should be constructed from multiple perspectives, such as lowering obesity and smoking rates and levels, and improving mental health, sleep quality, educational level and birthweight.' </p>

<p>The study, published in the journal Diabetologia, did not say how much sleep someone had to have to be considered an insomniac.</p>

<p>But adults are supposed to get seven or eight hours a night, or at least a minimum of six hours. </p>

<p>The Swedish scientists also identified 15 factors that appeared to have a protective effect against diabetes.</p>

<p>They included having high levels of good cholesterol, staying fit and healthy and being university-educated.</p>

<p>Going to university is normally associated with partying, drinking alcohol and eating fast food.</p>

<p>But university graduates normally come from wealthier background, which gives them better access to healthy foods.</p>

<p>It's the poorest in society who bear the burden of type 2 diabetes and obesity in the UK.</p>

<p>Professor Larsson added: 'Type 2 diabetes is a global public health issue, affecting nine in 100 adults worldwide in 2015 according to the International Diabetes Federation.</p>

<p>'The increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes along with severe complications cause an immense disease and economic burden.</p>

<p>'Therefore, it is important to better understand the causes of type 2 diabetes and establish prevention strategies.'</p>

<p>The study also identified a further 21 'suggestive' risk factors where evidence was not quite as strong.</p>

<p>These included drinking too much, skipping breakfast and consuming too much salt.</p>

<p>Professor Larsson said: 'This is the first study that has comprehensively assessed the causal associations between a large number of exposures and type 2 diabetes using the latest summary-level data for type 2 diabetes.'</p>

<p>She said the study design made the results the most reliable and accurate to date.  </p>
