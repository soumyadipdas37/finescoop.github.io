<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Al Murray has revealed his nephew Finley is 'very ill but hanging in there' amid his battle with a rare form of leukemia.</p>

<p>The comedian, 52, appeared on Monday's Lorraine, where he gave an update on his seven-year-old son, who is battling suffering juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, an incredibly rare form of the blood cancer that only 12 British children are diagnosed with each year.</p>

<p>Speaking to host Lorraine, 60, Al explained: 'He’s an incredibly brave little lad. He’s hanging on in there. I can’t tell you he’s well, he’s very ill but he’s hanging in there.' </p>

<p>Struggling: Al Murray has revealed his nephew Finley is 'very ill but hanging in there' amid his battle with a rare form of leukemia</p>

<p>He continued: 'He’s 7 and he wants to be at home playing football with his mates.</p>

<p>There’s been a decline in donors and contributions. The thing about blood stem cell donations is it’s dead easy. </p>

<p>'They send you a pack with swabs and you swab some cheek tissue and send it back to them.'</p>

<p>Speaking directly to viewers, the TV favourite added: 'What I really want to say to people is that this is dead easy to do and you will help someone.'</p>

<p>Al also discussed his experience with not gracing the stage everyday amid the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>He said: 'When this all started, I was about to go out on tour and I was like, I don’t want to go on tour, I don’t want to cut my hair. </p>

<p>'I thought I could manage without going on stage and getting acclaim from strangers but I was wrong. I’ve been doing the odd gig here and there and it turns out I really do need people to laugh at my jokes!'</p>

<p>In November last year, Al urged Good Morning Britain viewers to sign up to blood stem cell register after doctors diagnosed his nephew Finley with a rare form of leukaemia.  </p>

<p>Explaining that Finley was having to endure a week of chemotheraphy every three weeks and needs to find a donor by Christmas, Murray said: 'It's the only cure. We need people to register and we need to find a match. I know there's someone out there.'</p>

<p>Plea: In November last year, Al urged Good Morning Britain viewers to sign up to blood stem cell register after doctors diagnosed his nephew Finley with a rare form of leukaemia </p>

<p>Murray said Finley was a 'chirpy little lad' and was undergoing treatment at Great Ormond Street Hospital. </p>

<p>Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a cancer of the blood</p>

<p>It affects children mostly aged 4 and younger</p>

<p>Between one and two percent of children with leukaemia have JMML</p>

<p>Since about 10% of patients are diagnosed before 3 months of age, it is thought JMML is a congenital condition</p>

<p>The cancer is difficult to treat and is often resistant to chemotherapy</p>

<p>Bone marrow transplantation is currently the best therapy available </p>

<p>He told GMB: 'I can't imagine what his mum and dad are going through. I'm this close to it and I still find it kind of incomprehensible.</p>

<p>'This isn't just about Finley, either. Even if we don't find a match for Finley we might find a match for someone, a dozen people, a hundred people.</p>

<p>'This illness, he says I've got a bug in my blood that we need to squash, that's how he sees it. He's only six and I hope people can help us squash the bug in his blood.'</p>

<p>Finley's family had found two donors who were a match, but they pulled out of the donation a few weeks previously for unknown reasons. </p>

<p>Murray said signing up to the register through the charity We Delete Blood Cancer (DKMS) would only take a few minutes and could save Finley's life. </p>

<p>He added: 'I'm eligible and look at me; I'm 51 and I'm a schlub, I'm the opposite of someone who runs marathons and I'm eligible.</p>

<p>'This couldn't be easier to do and the change you could make, you could give someone another chance and help beat blood cancer.'  </p>

<p>To register as a blood stem cell donor, visit the DKMS website.    </p>

<p>Tough: Explaining that Finley was having to endure a week of chemotheraphy every three weeks and needs to find a donor by Christmas , Murray said: 'It's the only cure. We need people to register and we need to find a match. I know there's someone out there' </p>
