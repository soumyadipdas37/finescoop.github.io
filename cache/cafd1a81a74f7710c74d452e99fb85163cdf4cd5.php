<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid have made a public showing of Eden Hazard working out in the club gym this week, following recent accusations that he has once again 'turned up overweight' for pre-season training.</p>

<p>Just 12 months ago, following his multi-million pound move from Chelsea, Hazard was said to have arrived in the Spanish capital out of shape.</p>

<p>Now, following a stop-start season which was marred by injury, Hazard is once again back in pre-season preparation and questions are being asked regarding his seemingly larger frame.</p>

<p>Real Madrid posted this image of Eden Hazard to make a point of him working out in the gym</p>

<p>The winger was called up to the Belgian squad but wasn't played at all by Roberto Martinez</p>

<p>The flames were further stoked when Belgium boss Roberto Martinez called Hazard up for international duty in the UEFA Nations League, only to not play a single minute in the two matches against Denmark and Iceland. </p>

<p>Diario Sport in Spain report that the club feel Hazard, who signed from Chelsea for £150million in the summer of 2019, should have not reported for international duty and stayed with Real to work on his fitness.</p>

<p>There are questions over his commitment to turning around his fortunes at the Bernabeu following an underwhelming first season that was adversely affected by injury.</p>

<p>It comes as another frustration for Real manager Zinedine Zidane (left) after £150m signing Hazard struggled to make much of an impression during his first season</p>

<p>On Saturday Real Madrid made the interesting move of posting an image of Hazard working out with a large barbell at the club's Cuidad training quarters, without any apparent context.</p>

<p>The image was interpreted by many of Madrid's 91million social media followers as a tactic to reassure supporters that the club's star winger was taking preparation seriously.</p>

<p>Last season Hazard scored just one goal for his new side, as Madrid went on to reclaim the La Liga title from arch rivals Barcelona.</p>

<p>Under returning manager Zinedine however they were unable to continue their Champions League heroics, losing in the last 16 stage to Pep Guardiola's Manchester City over two legs. </p>
