<p>The 40-year-old hair pro, who counts the Kardashians and Chrissy Teigen among her A-list clientele, took to Instagram this weekend to share the very scary experience she had with her dog Roo.</p>

<p>She said the pup was running on the beach when she ate a cigarette filter with marijuana in it that someone had left behind — and after she woke up stiff and unresponsive, they had to rush her to the veterinarian. </p>

<p>Protect your pets! Celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin is warning others about the unexpected dangers of marijuana in pets</p>

<p>Trash: The 40-year-old hair pro says her dog Roo appears to have ingested a cigarette filter with marijuana still in it while out for a walk on the beach</p>

<p>Poor girl: After she woke up stiff and unresponsive, they had to rush her to the veterinarian</p>

<p>'Please be careful with your pets,' she said, warning that THC can be deadly for animals</p>

<p>'I was debating whether to share this or not but I think it’s important,' Jen wrote on Saturday.</p>

<p>'Roo was running around on the beach and the next morning we woke up to her non responsive and stiff. </p>

<p>'The vet told us they saw she threw up an end of a cigarette filter that probably had marijuana in it (no, not ours),' she went on.</p>

<p>She added that it is apparently quite common, now that weed is legal in California, for people to leave it in public areas — but it seems that many people don't realize that their actions can harm animals.</p>

<p>'It gave us the scare of our life for a good 24hrs but she’s ok after getting an IV x charcoal,' she said. </p>

<p>'Please be careful with your pets. A small percentage of dogs ingesting THC have lead to seizures and coma.'</p>

<p>She included a video of a terrified-looking Roo, squinting and shaking uncontrollably after her visit to the vet. </p>

<p>VIP: Jen is a celebrity hair stylist with a lot of famous clients </p>

<p>Famous friends: She's pictured with Kendall Jenner and Khloe Kardashian</p>

<p>Important day: She even did Hailey Bieber's hair for her wedding</p>

<p>While Jen's vet seemed to guess that a cigarette filter with remnants of marijuana was the culprit, edibles can also hurt dogs. </p>

<p>'Marijuana on its own can be highly toxic for dogs, but some of the ingredients in edibles, like chocolate or the sugar substitute Xylitol, can be deadly,' Michael San Filippo, a spokesperson for the American Veterinary Medical Association, told the Huffington Post.</p>

<p>'Even without a concern about these added edible ingredients, marijuana on its own is a threat to our pets’ health. Marijuana affects dogs differently than it does people. </p>

<p>'Some people think their dogs are experiencing the same high that people do. They’re not; they’re scared and sick and potentially in danger.' </p>

<p>According to The Spruce, symptoms of marijuana ingestion in dogs include lethargy, stumbling and difficulty walking, dilated pupils, dazed appearance, incontinence, vomiting, and agitation.</p>

<p>Careful! The ASPA's Animal Poison Control Center saw a 765 per cent increase in calls about the issue in the first couple of months of 2019</p>

<p>In severe cases, they might experience seizures or tremors, an abnormal heart rate, respiratory issues, hypotension, hypothermia (low body temperature), or even coma and death.</p>

<p>'When your pet ingests any toxic substance, it’s crucial to get to your vet or an emergency vet hospital right away for treatment. It could save your pet’s life,' Gary Weitzman, president and CEO of the San Diego Humane Society, told HuffPo. </p>

<p>According to the ASPCA, animal ingestion of marijuana is on the rise. The ASPA's Animal Poison Control Center saw a 765 per cent increase in calls about the issue in the first couple of months of 2019.    </p>

<p>This seems to be especially true in states where marijuana has been legalized in some form. </p>

<p>'In those states that have legalized marijuana, we are seeing an increased incidence of marijuana toxicity in pets, especially in dogs,' Dr. John de Jong of Massachusetts told NPR.</p>
