<p>The reality starlet put her peachy derriere in the spotlight in a thong, and stayed barefoot. </p>

<p>Malin completed the look with a delicate necklace and anklet, with a myriad of silver rings. </p>

<p>The mental health advocate later took to Instagram to share a hilarious clip dancing around in the underwear set that she captioned: 'I'M A SUPER FREAK.'  </p>

<p>Stunning: The former Love Island star, 27, exuded confidence as she worked her angles on the set in Manchester</p>

<p>Breast Cancer Awareness is a cause close to Malin's heart, as her mother Consy sadly died from the disease in 2017. Her father passed away from skin cancer 26 years ago.</p>

<p>Malin - who also lost her daughter Consy at four weeks old last year - has spoken candidly about her experience with grief. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Malin said she struggles to get her head around things sometimes. </p>

<p>Ink-redible! Malin put her curves on display as she went braless in a cropped pink top that also offered a look at her tattoos</p>

<p>Brunette beauty: Malin wore her glossy raven locks loose and tousled while she completed the look with a delicate necklace and anklet, with a myriad of silver rings</p>

<p>She penned: 'I tend to get angry when grief comes into play. I ask why baby was taken too. </p>

<p>'Then I get myself into a mess and have to reframe my mind again. The anger is just one of many emotions that stems from it. </p>

<p>'This is what I mean. Grief is one HUGE mess that can't ever be tidied away properly, it's like when you hide all your s**t under the bed, for it to build up before you have to do an entire spring clean. That is grief.</p>

<p>Loss: Breast Cancer Awareness is a cause close to Malin's heart, as her mother Consy (pictured) sadly died from the disease in 2017. Her father passed away from skin cancer 26 years ago</p>

<p>'If you feel like me today, allow yourself to feel it. Feel through it all. For whoever you have lost is also there right beside you feeling it with you.</p>

<p>'This life can be unfair and difficult at times.. but we should look up to the stars at what we are thankful for. Perspective. I know I'll see them again.'</p>
