<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez broke down in tears as he proclaimed the 'end of an era' at Barcelona after expressing gratitude for the club's faith in him ahead of his exit. </p>

<p>The Uruguayan striker, who will sign for Atletico Madrid in a £5.5million deal, brought down the curtain on six years at the Nou Camp by saying he will always be a fan of the club.  </p>

<p>Suarez joined Barca in 2014 and helped the club win four LaLiga titles, four Copa del Reys and the Champions League in 2015.</p>

<p>An emotional Luis Suarez broke down in tears as he said goodbye to Barcelona after six years on Thursday after completing a £5.5million move to Atletico Madrid</p>

<p>The 33-year-old said goodbye in an emotional farewell press conference at the Nou Camp on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>He said: 'It is such a surprise, I didn't have anything really prepared.</p>

<p>'The club has always had so much confidence in me since 2014 when they signed me. </p>

<p>'The conditions that I came here, they surrounded me, the confidence they had in me, it wasn't easy to accept this, the coaches and the team-mates, the way they accepted me when I came, it was amazing. </p>

<p>'All the people know the sacrifice that I made in these years to come to Barcelona and play for the best team in the world. I am aware we are at the end of an era but I should be very proud of everything we have done.'</p>

<p>Atletico Madrid confirmed that they have agreed a deal to sign Luis Suarez for £5.5million</p>

<p>During his time at Barcelona Suarez scored 198 goals in 283 appearances.</p>

<p>However, he was informed by recently-appointed manager Ronald Koeman that he isn't part of his plans.</p>

<p>Suarez has scored eight goals in 18 appearances against Atletico during his career, so Diego Simeone's side will certainly be pleased that he is now playing for them.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan will be determined to prove to Koeman that he made a mistake in letting him leave.</p>

<p>With Suarez departing, Antoine Griezmann, who endured a difficult first season at Barcelona, should receive more opportunities to play as a central striker. </p>

<p>Suarez scored 198 goals in 283 games and won four LaLiga titles and the Champions League</p>
