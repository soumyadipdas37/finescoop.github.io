<p>After after hearing the news, Lauren decided to put a halt to her grand plans for a big party with her pals.</p>

<p>Writing on her Instagram story, she said: 'Hey everyone due to new Borris rules (6 people) I won't be having a birthday party this year so everyone I've mesaged and who is coming it's no longer going ahead.</p>

<p>Childhood sweethearts Lauren and Mark, 33, became engaged on TOWIE, after both starring since its inauguration in 2010, and were a couple for 11 years before suffering an extremely acrimonious break-up in 2012.</p>

<p>But Lauren shared a slew of throwback snaps at the weekend - including pictures of her ex - to celebrate the 10 year anniversary special of TOWIE.</p>

<p>The reality star took to Instagram to thank the famous show for providing her with meaningful 'memories' and insisted she's 'proud' of all her castmates.</p>

<p>The media personality wrote in an accompanying caption: '10 years ago changed my life we created a show called "the only way is Essex" I was 22 when I first started filming and what an amazing journey this has been !!</p>

<p>'I put my life on national television and we won a BAFTA - not a lot people can say that! You've seen me laugh, cry, engaged, break ups and make ups ! I've grown up on the screens and it was all real!</p>

<p>'Congratulations to all the OGs <?php echo e('@'); ?>towie these images are from google thank you for memories and well to all my costars im proud of you all and always will be.' (sic)</p>

<p>Mark and Lauren have been on bad terms ever since they called it quits, and the former Extra host went on to tie the knot with actress Michelle Keegan, 33, in May 2015.</p>

<p>Lauren previously branded their marriage 'weird' and claimed they don't speak to each other.</p>

<p>Speaking to Heat Magazine, she said: 'I saw them both in the gym. They don't talk it's really weird. I was like 'F**king hell, we weren't like that'. It's like they don't know each other. I can't go into that though. I'm just so glad that ain't me'.</p>
