<p>Participants were shown images of subjects and asked to rate their physical attractiveness.</p>

<p>Without knowing the subjects' background, they routinely labeled people who were generous with their time as more fetching.</p>

<p>Researchers said the results prove that people perceived as good-looking are more likely to give, and those who give are more likely to be perceived as good-looking. </p>

<p>New research indicates that people who are giving are viewed as more attractive, even by people who don't know about their generous nature</p>

<p>To find their results, a team at Indiana State University analyzed three large studies - one that took a snapshot of older adults' attitudes and two longitudinal studies tracking adolescents, one of which followed its subjects for 54 years.</p>

<p>They asked two research questions: Are individuals who undertake more giving behaviors rated as more physically attractive? And the reverse, are beautiful people more likely to be generous?</p>

<p>To avoid the halo effect - in which attractive people are assumed to be good - the participants had no information on a subject's giving behavior when looking at their image.</p>

<p>The report, published in Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Quarterly, found that when it comes to older adults, people who volunteered and gave affection had higher attractiveness ratings.</p>

<p>An analysis of three large studies found that older participants ranked subjects who volunteered and who showed affection easily as better looking. Younger participants also scored people with a history of volunteering as more attractive </p>

<p>For younger participants, those who volunteered scored higher.</p>

<p>Co-author Femida Handy, a professor of social policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said all three studies illustrated a consistent link between giving behaviors and attractiveness, 'despite being conducted at different times, using different participants, and using different methods and measures.'</p>

<p>'Poets and philosophers have suggested the link between moral and physical beauty for centuries,' said co-author Sara Konrath, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy.</p>

<p>'This study confirms that people who are perceived as more attractive are more likely to give and givers are seen as more attractive.'</p>

<p>Their research disproves the stereotype that beautiful people are vain and self-centered, Konrath said.</p>

<p>And it suggests that, rather than cosmetic surgery, being giving is the key to being beautiful.</p>

<p>'Our findings suggest that beauty products and procedures may not be the only way to enhance an individual's attractiveness,' Konrath said. </p>

<p>'Perhaps being generous could be the next beauty trend.'</p>

<p>Generosity has other benefits beyond boosting attractiveness - scientists say it can also make you happier and healthier.</p>

<p>A Swiss study from 2018 found that participants who gave money away reported higher levels of happiness.</p>

<p>According to the report, neurons in an area of the brain associated with generosity activate neurons in the ventral striatum, which are associated with happiness.</p>

<p>And a study done at the University of Michigan found that people who regularly engaged in volunteer work were two-and-a-half times more likely to live longer than those who didn't.</p>

<p>In an experiment at Harvard, students' immune systems were elevated just by watching a video of Mother Theresa tending to the sick. </p>

<p>Being generous really does make people happier, according to research from an international team of experts.</p>

<p>Neurons in an area of the brain associated with generosity activate neurons in the ventral striatum, which are associated with happiness, the study found.</p>

<p>A group of 50 volunteers in Switzerland took part in a spending experiment, with each given 25 Swiss Francs (£20/$25) per week for four weeks. </p>

<p>As part of the experiment, participants performed an independent decision-making task, in which they could behave more or less generously while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p>

<p>They were asked to choose to give between three and 25 francs of their money as a present to a recipient different from those previously chosen.</p>

<p>The researchers found that participants who had committed to spending their endowment on others behaved more generously in the decision-making task.</p>

<p>They also discovered greater self-reported increases in happiness as compared to the control group. </p>

<p>The full results were published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>
