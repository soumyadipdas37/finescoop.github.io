<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A museum pulled a jewelry line that named products after black victims of police brutality following accusations that it capitalized and made a commodity of black trauma. </p>

<p>The Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina, announced that it cancelled plans to sell the 'Wear Their Names' collection after swift backlash from local activists and social media.</p>

<p>'Justice is not jewelry. Especially not jewelry named after Black bodies. Its heinous,' said local activist Tamika Gadsen.</p>

<p>The 'Wear Their Names' collection featured necklaces, earrings, bolo ties and rings outfitted with pieces of shattered window glass collected during Black Lives Matter demonstrations in May.    </p>

<p>Each piece of jewelry was specifically named after a black American who died at the hands of law enforcement, and prices ranged from less than $50 to nearly $500.</p>

<p>The Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, South Carolina, said it would no long er sell jewelry pieces featured in the 'Wear Their Names' collection</p>

<p>The collection featured necklaces, rings, bracelets and rings named after black victims of police brutality (pictured)</p>

<p>A necklace named 'The Breonna' for Breonna Taylor was priced at $240; a similar piece called 'The Elijah' after Elijah McClain cost $480; and 'The Trayvon' in reference to Trayvon Martin was listed for $45.</p>

<p>A necklace named for Tanisha Pughsley was discounted from $190 to $155, while an earring referencing Tamir Rice was sold out.</p>

<p>The Charleston couple behind the controversial collection, Paul Chelmis and Jin Wen, explained their rationale to Charleston Scene last week. </p>

<p>Paul Chelmis and Jin Wen (left ti right) told Charleston Scene last week that they were inspired while watching demonstrations unfold in May</p>

<p>The pair was inspired after watching a Facebook Live stream of a peaceful demonstration in Charleston on May 30. Later that night, some residents would damage local property during clashes with law enforcement. </p>

<p>'I kind of saw it as a natural reaction,' Chelmis told the publication. 'Like yeah, of course this is the result of our inattention. </p>

<p>'Instead of focusing on how terrible these people are who are "rioting," we should focus on what we should do to prevent it from happening in the future.'</p>

<p>After talking, the couple decided to 'make something beautiful out of the rubble' and collected the damaged shards of glass from outside storefronts and buildings. </p>

<p>The products were featured on Shan Shui, the couple's online store, and would be sold in the Gibbes Museum of Art gift shop. </p>

<p>Proceeds would be donated to 'From Privilege to Progress,' a nonprofit organization seeking to 'desegregate' discussions about racism.</p>

<p>But the plan was quickly scrapped when activists and others lambasted the collection, with some comparing the sale of the jewelry to a 'slave auction.'</p>

<p>On Twitter, and 18-year-old activist named Sophie Ming decried the pieces for being monetized and for the proceeds not being directed to the victims' families.</p>

<p>'It’s as if the name attached to the product determines the monetary value of each life. That’s what I’m getting, it’s disturbing,' she wrote. </p>

<p>Tamika Gadsen, founder of the Charleston Activist Network, shared that sentiment and blasted the collection online after reading an article about it in the Post and Courier.</p>

<p>Sophie Ming, an activist who spoke out on Twitter, criticized the collection for monetizing black victims' lives and called it 'disturbing'</p>

<p>Both Elijah McClain (left) and Trayvon Martin (right) were featured in the collection with pieces priced from $95 to $480</p>

<p>One necklace in the 'Wear Their Name' collection was named after Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was shot dead by Louisville officers this year</p>

<p>'I stumbled across this story in my Twitter feed, and it’s not hyperbole when I say I’ve never responded so quickly to something so egregiously ill-conceived in Charleston. I’ve never reacted that fast,' she told Yahoo Life. </p>

<p>'I pushed myself to finish the article in record time to make sure I got all of the details, to see if this was a joke — maybe there’s more to the story.'</p>

<p>Gadsen described the collection under Shan Shui as a type of performative activism that, outwardly, had the appearance of supporting the black community but actually profited off the pain.</p>

<p>What struck her as particularly offensive was the bolo tie named after Eric Garner, a 43-year-old New York father who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold.</p>

<p>Garner was seen on video pleading 'I can't breathe,' which was echoed by George Floyd six years later and became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>After Garner's death, New York banned the use of chokeholds by officers.</p>

<p>'When you name a bolo tie after Eric Garner, the gruesomeness just leapt from the page. It’s so Charleston to mischaracterize that gruesome exercise as charity,' said Gadsen.</p>

<p>'They made something gruesome look beautiful.' </p>

<p>People on social media spoke out as well to call the collection 'tasteless' and disappointing.</p>

<p>'There is an appropriate and inappropriate way to depict tragedies through art. Here is an example of a completely inappropriate, tone deaf, and tasteless way to do it...' one Twitter user wrote.</p>

<p>'Naming pieces after them and selling them for different prices give me slave auction vibes,' another said.</p>

<p>One person called it 'disgusting' and said 'do not commodify the Black Lives Matter movement, police brutality and murder.'</p>

<p>A number of Twitter users spoke out against the collection  and expressed disappointment that black victims' were being used in the project</p>

<p>Some social media users compared the sale of the Wear Their Names collection to a 'slave auction'</p>

<p>User: 'Calling it "art" is no excuse. Regardless of where the money goes, you're commodifying the suffering of these families. There's a difference between support and exploitation.'</p>

<p>User: 'What the actual hell is this? I swear people will always find a way to capitalize black people's pain'</p>

<p>'Calling it 'art' is no excuse. Regardless of where the money goes, you're commodifying the suffering of these families. There's a difference between support and exploitation.'</p>

<p>In response to Sophie Ming's original post, one user said: 'What the actual hell is this? I swear people will always find a way to capitalize black people's pain.</p>

<p>'And I'm sure none of that money will go to the family members of any of those people their jewelry is named after.'</p>

<p>In response to the outcry, Chelmis and Wen apologized with a now-deleted message on their social media.</p>

<p>Shan Shui: 'Though we only wanted to honor the victim's names and retell their story, we see now that using those names was inappropriate and in poor taste'</p>

<p>Pictured: a bolo tie featured as part of the 'Wear Their Name' collection</p>

<p>'While out intentions were pute and we consulted a wide variety of people before launching, it is clear that there are issues with the approach that we took,' the statement read.</p>

<p>'Though we only wanted to honor the victim's names and retell their story, we see now that using those names was inappropriate and in poor taste.'</p>

<p>As of Friday, Shan Shui's website and social media accounts have been removed.</p>

<p>While the couple's approach has been criticized, Gadsen hoped that people would look beyond this one instance and educate themselves on the larger context.</p>

<p>'White people feel entitled to tell us what we should do with our pain and how we should memorialize it,' said Gadsen.</p>

<p>'This is the time for white and non-Black POC folk to listen to Black people, not to take up space — and that’s what they did.'      </p>
