<p>And Jason Donovan, 52, did little to dispel the rumours as he was seen with an injury on his forehead during a morning stroll with wife Angela. </p>

<p>The ITV skating show has famously injured many contestants, with the death-defying headbanger move - that makes an appearance on every series - actually banned in professional figure skating tournaments because it's so dangerous. </p>

<p>Looks like a real headbanger: Jason Donovan, 52, did little to dispel rumours he's signed up for Dancing On Ice as he was seen with an injury during a morning stroll with wife Angela</p>

<p>Yet despite sporting a mystery injury, Jason seemed in good spirits as he headed out in London on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Keeping things casual for the outing, the Australian actor opted for a plain white T-shirt and navy shorts. </p>

<p>Angela also opted for a low-key ensemble in a pink top and leggings as she chatted away with her husband. </p>

<p>The pair were no doubt keen to enjoy some quality time together now, as Jason will need to dedicate plenty of time to training on the rink if he's signed up for Dancing On Ice.   </p>

<p>The former Neighbours heartthrob - who competed on Strictly in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the ITV show when it airs in January.</p>

<p>Delightful duo: The couple stayed close to one another as they strolled arm in arm</p>

<p>'He knows how to dance but if he thinks it’ll be any help once he’s on the ice he has another thing coming. </p>

<p>'He’s hoping to rank higher in this show than he did on Strictly, he just needs to find out if he can stay upright once he has his skates on.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Jason's representatives for comment.  </p>

<p>Enjoy it now: The pair were no doubt keen to enjoy some quality time together now, as Jason will need to dedicate plenty of time to training on the rink if he's signed up for Dancing On Ice</p>

<p>Jason isn't the only West End star who has been linked to the rink, with Denise Van Outen said to have signed a deal worth around £40,000 to appear on the series. </p>

<p>According to the Daily Star, Denise 'jumped at the chance' to take part in the show when it kicks off in January after impressing at an audition last month.</p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'Bosses are thrilled to have her on board. They know she will give it her all in training and be popular with viewers.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-one is a natural performer after reaching the final of Strictly Come Dancing in 2012 and playing Roxie Hart in the musical Chicago on Broadway and in the West End.</p>

<p>One to watch: The former Neighbours heartthrob - who competed on Strictly in 2011 - is expected to join the star-studded line-up on the ITV show when it airs in January</p>

<p>Will he, won't he? On Jason's rumoured DOI stint, a source told The Sun, 'Jason is a great signing for the show as he has plenty of star power'</p>

<p>Another celebrity who is said to have signed on the dotted line is Rebekah Vardy, who allegedly scored a £50,000 deal for the show.</p>

<p>The WAG, 38, is in the midst of a £1 million court battle with Coleen Rooney, 34, and is now said to have set her sights on the reality competition show, according to a report from The Sun on Saturday.</p>

<p>A source speaking to the publication claimed: 'She'll bring star quality to their line-up and interest from footie fans. </p>

<p>The source continued: 'He knows how to dance but if he thinks it’ll be any help once he’s on the ice he has another thing coming'</p>

<p>They concluded: 'He’s hoping to rank higher in this show than he did on Strictly, he just needs to find out if he can stay upright once he has his skates on'</p>

<p>'Of course viewers will be watching for any references to Wagatha Christie. </p>

<p>'She feels ready to return to the limelight. She can't live under a shadow forever and wants to remind people she's a fun mum.'</p>

<p>The source added that Rebekah's footballer husband Jamie will be on the sidelines to support her.</p>

<p>The Sun also reports that Olympic sprint legend Colin Jackson, 53, has also signed up for the show after proving he's got rhythm back on Strictly Come Dancing in 2005.</p>

<p>Get your skates on! Even though the show won't kick off for four months, producers seem keen to form their line-up so the stars would have time to learn basic skating skills over winter</p>

<p>Whilst the official line up has yet to be confirmed by ITV, a slew of celebrities have been seen vying for a spot on the show in recent months. </p>

<p>Back in July, Coronation Street's Sally Dyvenor and Real Housewives of Cheshire star Dawn Ward were among the TV stars pictured arriving for auditions at an ice rink in Manchester.</p>

<p>They joined WAG Tanya Bardsley, Hollyoaks' Carley Stenson, Celebrity Gogglebox's Mark 'Bez' Berry and Emmerdale's Samantha Giles.</p>

<p>Other stars arriving included Corrie's Sally Whittaker, Alex Fletcher (Brookside), West End star Jodie Prenger, Jake Canuso (Benidorm), and Emmerdale's Joe-Warren Plant and Alex Lincoln.</p>

<p>Dancing queens: Denise Van Outen and Rebekah Vardy are also said to have signed up to the next season, scooping £40,000 and £50,000 respectively </p>

<p>Strictly talented: Olympic sprint legend Colin Jackson, 53, is also said to have signed up for the show after proving he's got rhythm back on Strictly Come Dancing in 2005</p>

<p>The upcoming season of Dancing On Ice will be a tough gig for the stars to land, however, as they are also completing against the likes of  Made In Chelsea's Olivia Bentley, TOWIE's Billie Faiers and Love Island's Luke Trotman. </p>

<p>The trio were seen attending the first batch of auditions alongside former footballer Wayne Bridge, Olympians Denise Lewis and Mark Foster and darts player Fallon Sherrock.  </p>

<p>Fellow reality stars vying for a spot also reportedly include Love Island's Dr Alex George and Ru Paul's Drag Race star Baga Chipz.</p>

<p>Singer Toyah Wilcox is also said to have tried out along with comedian Rufus Hound, This Morning star Lisa Maxwell, Tattoo Fixers star Stephen 'Sketch' Porter and vlogger LadBaby. </p>

<p>Even though the show won't kick off for four months, producers seem keen to form their line-up so the stars would have time to learn basic skating skills over winter.</p>

<p>The professional skater line-up will also look a bit different next year as producers decided not to renew the contracts of 2019 winner Alex Murphy or Alex Demetriou, whilst Brianne Delcourt quit the show after moving to Canada with husband Kevin Kilbane. </p>

<p>Dancing On Ice bosses are reportedly now keen on setting a new precedent by introducing their first black professional skater. </p>

<p>In an effort to promote equality and support black, Asian and ethnic minority groups, sources have revealed ITV are making a concerted effort to increase diversity within their cast. </p>

<p>No more: The professional skater line-up will also look a bit different next year as (L-R) 2019 winner Alex Murphy, Alex Demetriou and Brianne Delcourt will not be returning </p>
