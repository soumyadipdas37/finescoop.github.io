<p>Sweet display: David was proving himself to very much be back to rude health as he showcased his ripped arms during his frolic in the sea</p>

<p>Oh my! The couple could not take their hands off one another </p>

<p>Sweet: David was giving his partner a tender embrace on the shores </p>

<p>The whole family: The duo were on hand to look after their two-year-old</p>

<p>All aboard! The whole group were larking around in the sea </p>

<p>As well as their two-year-old daughter, Maeva also has a young daughter from a previous relationship, while David is father to son Andrea, 27 and daughter Carla, 23 from his marriage to Coraline.</p>

<p>David suffered a devastating heart attack while playing in a charity football match in France in May 2016, which he revealed left him 'clinically dead' for nine minutes.</p>

<p>He collapsed during the match, swallowed his tongue and had stopped breathing before he was revived by paramedics, who had arrived with a defibrillator.</p>

<p>David appeared on This Morning in November 2018 to speak about the shortage of people who know first aid, with CPR playing a pivotal role in saving his life.</p>

<p>He said of the terrifying event: 'I was just playing football, and I just collapsed. There’s no warnings or alarms, no pain. I just collapsed. It's very strange as when you wake up, you don't feel any pain, so you ask yourself: Why are you here?'</p>

<p>Having a laugh: It was all fun and games for the whole family </p>

<p>He's back: David suffered a devastating heart attack while playing in a charity football match in France in May 2016, which he revealed left him 'clinically dead' for nine minutes</p>

<p>Dipping away: David was giving his daughter all his attention in the water </p>

<p>Stunner: Her black bikini was simple in design yet stunning in impact </p>

<p>Stressing the importance of first aid, he continued: 'Someone on the pitch was able to perform CPR. There were probably 15 people there, and only one or two could do CPR.'</p>

<p>'That's when I realised something was wrong, only two people knew how to perform CPR?'</p>

<p>Speaking about the risks hereditary health issues pose, David explained: 'My mum died in 2005 from a heart attack. My dad had many problems with his heart. I heard that it was hereditary.'  </p>

<p>My girl: He was playing in the water with the tot </p>
