<p>Camilla Kerslake, nicknamed the Scrummy Soprano thanks to her romance with former England rugby captain Chris Robshaw – is set to appear in a wrestling-themed production at the Cockpit Theatre and then the Playground Theatre in London this month. </p>

<p>Bread And Circuses is described as ‘a mash-up between World Wrestling Entertainment, verismo opera, and 1990s-style video-gaming’.</p>

<p>The chef shared the snap on Instagram with the caption: ‘17 months old and already driving.’</p>

<p>The loos were the only area where guests were allowed to take pictures after a £55 million club makeover – and 25,000 selfies were taken. </p>

<p>But new rules forbid cameras anywhere in the club ‘including bathrooms’.</p>
