<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Capaldi has dug deep for a stunning first home complete with its very own island, but it’s still just a stone’s throw from his beloved mum and dad.</p>

<p>The Scottish singer, 23, paid a reported £1.6million for the sprawling five-bedroom Castlehill property in August as he prepares to finally move out of his parents’ house.</p>

<p>But homesickness won’t be an issue, with his new purchase based just 30-miles from the Capaldi family home in Bathgate, West Lothian. </p>

<p>Splashing out: Lewis has dug deep for a stunning first home, but it’s still just a stone’s throw from his beloved mum and dad</p>

<p>In terms of design however, it’s a fair cry from his comparatively modest upbringing, with plenty of interior and exterior space for the singer to unwind. </p>

<p>Surrounded by acres of picturesque countryside, Capaldi’s new home comes with a series of unique details – notably a summer house built on an island in the middle of a large, tranquil pond.</p>

<p>A former farmhouse, the property also boasts a series of stables for the aspiring horse breeder – although it’s not known if Capaldi has plans to redevelop this part of the estate.</p>

<p>Not bad: An enormous glass conservatory sits at the rear of the property, offering the singer welcome viewers of the garden and its wide assortment of trees, shrubbery and neatly manicured lawns</p>

<p>But Capaldi might have little use for the space due to his master bedroom coming with a large en-suite - complete with its very own jacuzzi. </p>

<p>Touching on the singer's decision to remain close to his family, a source told The Sun: 'Lewis could buy a place to stay anywhere in the world — this shows just how much he loves Scotland. It’s a far cry from his family home where he recorded his first music.'</p>

<p>No place like home: Lewis offered a glimpse inside his family home that he shared with his mum Carol, a nurse, and fishmonger dad Mark, in January</p>

<p>Earlier this year the singer used his YouTube channel to give fans a guided tour of the cluttered bedroom inside his family home, complete with New York wallpaper and Ikea style furniture.</p>

<p>Speaking on why he still lives at home, the star - who had occupied the bedroom since the age of 10 - admitted he'd rather spend his money on food than rent.</p>

<p>He told the Daily Star: 'All I spend my money on is food because I can't help stuffing my face. I am splurging on food and it shows, it's showing on my gut, my gut is expanding every day.' </p>

<p>According to The Sun , Lewis was previously estimated to have had a net worth of almost £8 million by Forbes, but the singer denied earning such an amount.</p>

<p>Taking to Instagram last year, the singing sensation hilariously mocked the reports that stated he's net worth was sitting at close to US $10 million.</p>

<p>In a comic rage, he said: 'It says according to Forbes and Wikipedia, Lewis Capaldi's estimated net worth is $10 million.</p>

<p>'I have less than £200 in my bank right now so who the f*** has my $10 million.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'Are you telling I'm kicking about in the same clothes I've worn for the last six months and there's $10 million sitting about somewhere, where is it?</p>

<p>'I still live with my mum and dad, I've been in the same bedroom since I was 12-years-old and there's apparently $10 million sitting there? If the tax man sees that, I'm f****d'.'</p>

<p>Tour: The bedroom tour revealed that Lewis still has the same desk in one corner of the room, with a vanity mirror on the wall above, along with a poster-covered cupboard for his tracksuits</p>
