<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Victorian government is considering banning indoor dining until community transmissions of COVID-19 reach zero and hold at that level for two weeks.</p>

<p>With just one week to go before the coronavirus-hit state's stay-at-home orders are due to end after more than two months, an announcement on what the road out of lockdown will look like is to be announced on Sunday.</p>

<p>So far Premier Daniel Andrews has given few details, but a new report by the Herald Sun on Sunday has revealed that ban on indoor dining will continue.</p>

<p>The modelling for the plan is based on a similar policy which was introduced in New York after the city was ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic back in April.</p>

<p>With just one week to go before Victoria's stay-at-home orders are lifted, an announcement on what the road out of lockdown will look like is to be announced on Sunday</p>

<p>One of the state's leading restaurateurs has labelled the move a 'disaster' which will cost the already struggling hospitality industry 150,000 jobs.    </p>

<p>'They are locked into a death spiral that will see a lot of us go broke,' Chris Lucas, the CEO of Melbourne's largest restaurant group Lucas Restaurants, said.</p>

<p>The Restaurant and Catering Industry of Australia predicts about one third of the Victoria's food industry staff could be affected if the restrictions are extended.</p>

<p>Mr Lucas says further shutdowns will mean about 20 to 30 per cent of the state's restaurants and cafe will never re-open. </p>

<p>In past few weeks government officials have been in talks with the hospitality sector about about the best way to exit lockdown.</p>

<p>But some in the industry have called the negotiations 'futile'. </p>

<p>Mr Lucas warns further shutdowns will mean about 30 per cent of the state's restaurants and cafes will never re-open (pictured, a closed cafe in Melbourne)</p>

<p>That means about 150,000 jobs could be lost in the already struggling hospitality industry (pictured, an empty restaurant in Melbourne's Lygon Street)</p>

<p>'The industry consultations have been a platform used by the government to basically dictate to us what their plan is for each industry,' Mr Lucas said.</p>

<p>He claims any genuine concerns they've been dismissed and that a senior government minister told him the state government was committed to it's zero community transmissions policy at all costs.</p>

<p>'The so called plan that they are going around saying that they're getting industry input from is a lie,' Mr Lucas said.</p>

<p>In the past two weeks there have been been 531 community transmissions in Victoria. </p>

<p>Health experts and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian have warned that COVID-19 infections may never reach zero and remain there for two weeks. </p>

<p>But Mr Andrews has warned 'thousands' of Victorians would die if strict coronavirus restrictions were to be lifted too swiftly.</p>

<p>Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne, and Stage Three in the rest of the state, are set to end on September 13 at 11.59pm. </p>

<p>But speaking on Saturday, a day ahead of his announcement on easing restrictions, Mr Andrews said lockdown was unlikely to end. </p>

<p>Victorians have been cooped up since July 8 only permitted to leave the house for essential reasons like grocery shopping, health appointments, work and exercise. </p>

<p>'To open up with those numbers would, of course, see the total number of coronavirus infections explode,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>'It would see many, many hundreds, indeed thousands, of Victorians infected with this virus. </p>

<p>'So, as frustrating, as challenging as it is, we need to stay the course on this. </p>

<p>'That's why tomorrow we will outline a road map to ease these important restrictions, to ease out of the second wave, once it's appropriately and properly defeated. Truly defeated.' </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths on Saturday, with the welcome infection numbers coming after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.</p>

<p>If COVID-19 infections were to spread out-of-control, Australia's health system could become overwhelmed, according to modelling by the Grattan Institute (pictured, their report)</p>

<p>Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 59 deaths announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.</p>

<p>Bombshell leaked documents also revealed on Thursday that Melbourne's strict Stage 4 lockdown could be extended by another two weeks. </p>

<p>A top secret draft for Victoria's recovery appeared to reveal the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks. </p>

<p>While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', Mr Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage 4 restrictions.</p>

<p>'Everything is on the table,' he admitted. 'It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.' </p>

<p>According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage 4 comes to an end.</p>

<p>The final decision will be announced on Sunday. </p>

<p>State of disaster: Increased police powers to enforce the lockdown. Cautions will no longer be issued, only $1,652 fines or court summons</p>

<p>Cafes and restaurants stay open for takeaway, as do supermarkets, etc</p>

<p>Schools: All students learning from home unless they are vulnerable or parents are essential workers. Kindy and childcare closed</p>

<p>Funerals: No change to funeral limits, but only 10 mourners can leave Melbourne to regional Victoria for one</p>
