<p>Oh dear: The Bachelor's Sam Wood has revealed a dramatic new look. The reality star showed off the disastrous results of an at-home haircut from his wife Snezana on Wednesday </p>

<p>'Hi, my name is Bob. I let my wife give me a Covid cut,' Sam wrote alongside a selfie of himself.</p>

<p>Sam's shoulder length hair was cut to just below his ears, causing his tresses to fall in ringlets.  </p>

<p>My, how you've changed! Like many people stuck in Melbourne during lockdown, Sam has sported a very relaxed look this year. (L) on The Bachelor in 2015, and right last month</p>

<p>Sam's fans couldn't get enough of the hilarious haircut, with one writing: 'Soo funny!! Just sums up the craziness / sh*t show of 2020!'  </p>

<p>Another added: 'If 2020 was a haircut, this is it.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one said: 'Just need an orange tan and a green dye to go with the cut and we're set!!!!' </p>

<p>Lockdown: Sam, whose Adonis-like physique and slicked-back hair sent hearts aflutter on The Bachelor in 2015, has shown off a different look this year. (L) 2015, and right in July</p>

<p>Like most of us, Sam has been merrily sporting a very different lockdown look this year. </p>

<p>He has grown out his usually cropped hair into long, grey-streaked tresses. </p>

<p>The star's shaggy 'do was complemented by a rugged beard and moustache which he only recently shaved.</p>

<p>Sam is currently self-isolating with his wife, Snezana, 39, and their three children, Charlie, one, Willow, two, and 14-year-old Eve - Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship.  </p>

<p>Life in lockdown: Sam is currently self-isolating with his wife, Snezana Markoski, 39, and their three children, Charlie, one, Willow, two, and 14-year-old Eve - Snezana's daughter from a previous relationship</p>

<p>In July, the fitness expert spoke to FEMAIL about how people who have gained weight in self-isolation can easily achieve their pre-lockdown figure.   </p>

<p>'Moving your body in some way every day is most important,' Sam explained. </p>

<p>'It doesn't matter how and when - but it is good to mix it up, rather than doing the same workout each day,' he added.  </p>
