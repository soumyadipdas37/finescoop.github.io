<p>Candice and Chris Dix left their two young sons with their grandparents in Perth three weeks ago to travel to Kiev to collect their daughters. </p>

<p>They were due to fly home on Sunday, but in a devastating turn of events Ukraine closed its borders that same day after recording 2,096 new COVID-19 cases and 35 new deaths.</p>

<p>With all flights to Australia now suspended for months, the parents are now trapped in the Ukraine with no idea when they will be able to see their boys again. </p>

<p>Candice and Chris Dix (pictured) left their two young sons with their grandparents in Perth, Western Australia, three weeks ago to travel to Kiev to collect their daughters</p>

<p>The couple told 9 News it has been 'really hard' to get a hold of the Australian embassy in Kiev due to the sheer quantity of people trying to leave the eastern European nation.</p>

<p>The father-of-four said they feel 'completely powerless' to change the situation and made a desperate plea to the Prime Minster for help.</p>

<p>‘From one father to another Scott, I’m begging you mate ... help me get my family home,' he said.</p>

<p>'Help us get home to our boys and introduce our precious girls to their older brothers.'</p>

<p>Mrs Dix explained the pair had no choice but to travel to the Ukraine during the pandemic for the birth of their twins, but left their sons behind to 'keep them safe'.</p>

<p>'No Australian in their right mind would travel here right now, or to any European city right now, but we had no choice,' she said. </p>

<p>Mrs Dix also said they decided to leave their sons (pictured) behind to 'keep them safe'</p>

<p>'Our surrogate mum was halfway through the pregnancy when COVID-19 hit, and any parent would know, you can't leave your babies.' </p>

<p>If the Dix's mange to get on a flight to Australia, they will likely have to fly to Sydney and then pay for two weeks in a government-approved quarantine hotel before flying to Western Australia and quarantining again, adding a month to the length of time before they can see their kids.</p>

<p>Australia closed the nation's international borders to tourists to halt the spread of COVID-19 on March 20 and told citizens overseas that they should return as soon as possible.  </p>

<p>In early July, however, tight international arrival caps were introduced limiting the number of passengers a plane could bring into the country - only 4,000 a week.</p>

<p>If the Dix's mange to get on a flight to Australia, they will likely have to fly to Sydney and pay for two weeks in a government-approved quarantine hotel before flying to Western Australia</p>

<p>The decision was made due to Australia's commitment to strict hotel quarantine for 14 days for every returning travel, amid fears large numbers of arrivals could disrupt the complicated system. </p>

<p>According to government estimates, 18,800 Australians in other countries are looking to return home. </p>

<p>Opposition Foreign Affairs spokesperson Penny Wong on Friday said the government should be providing financial support for those Australians stuck overseas.</p>

<p>The government has advised those stranded to access early superannuation withdrawals and there have been reports of consular staff advising citizens to start crowdfunding pages.</p>
