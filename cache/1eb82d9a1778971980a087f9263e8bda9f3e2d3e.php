<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Aston Martin has released its latest model, but it doesn't have wheels, a roof or doors - and the only engine it runs is a search engine.</p>

<p>That's because the AMR-C01 is the British car maker's new racing simulator designed for those living in luxury homes who want to compete in virtual races online.</p>

<p>It's certainly destined to be a 'Mega Drive' but comes at a staggering cost of £69,000 for UK customers. </p>

<p>The same amount of money buys you one of many - real - high-performance cars, including a Jaguar F-Type with a V8 motor.</p>

<p>Mega Drive: This is the Aston Martin AMR-C01, a gaming simulator you can have in your home - but you'll need extremely deep pockets if you want one...</p>

<p>Almost £70,000 is a hefty sum for what is essentially a toy for the home, but with gaming and e-sports - where professional gamers compete against each other - taking off and becoming a multi-million-pound business, the demand for high-end equipment such as this is growing.  </p>

<p>And the AMR-C01 - built in conjunction with Curv Racing Simulators - is as advanced as an online racing rig can get.</p>

<p>It's primarily aimed at casual gamers with extremely deep pockets but also fully-fledged F1 drivers and other professional racers who want to get their eye in during breaks in the season. </p>

<p>Why is it so expensive? Like soon-to-arrive Valkyrie hypercar, it has a carbon fibre monocoque chassis to make it extremely rigid and closely replicate a genuine race car.</p>

<p>Inclusive of VAT, the rig for racing game costs a staggering £69,000 for UK customers</p>

<p>The super-thin and lightweight driving chair has minimal padding, but is more than F1 drivers get in their cars</p>

<p>The seat position is the same as that in the Aston Martin Valkyrie. The pedal box - with throttle and brake - adjusts electronically, so short-legged users can move the controls closer to the chair</p>

<p>The body is shaped to mimic the design of the British maker's current and future line-up of super-fast models, with the tip of the nose on the simulator reflecting the actual cars' grille shape.</p>

<p>Climb aboard and the rig has an extremely skinny lightweight seat with a modicum of padding, which is more than Lewis Hamilton and his F1 rivals get.  </p>

<p>The seating position is the same as that in the of the Valkyrie supercar and is not adjustable. </p>

<p>Instead, the pedal box with the throttle and brake is electrically adjustable, so at the push of a button can be brought closer to the wheel or further away, depending on your height.</p>

<p>The wheel itself looks like it's been taken straight from a Formula One machine, with a mass of mutli-function controls to allow gamers to flick through modes and functionality as they chase their best virtual lap times.</p>

<p>The wheel also has a small screen to display lap and split times, gear selection and the rev counter.</p>

<p>The screen is a 49-inch Samsung curved LED monitor, which is among the best you can get for gaming.</p>

<p>Mounted to the rig is a massive 49-inch curved Samsung LED monitor, which is among the best displays for gaming you can get at the moment</p>

<p>The steering wheel is a cutaway design similar to an F1 wheel. It has an explosion of control switches and buttons and a digital display to show the rev counter, gear selection and split times</p>

<p>The hefty price is mainly due to the construction, which is a carbon-fibre monocoque</p>

<p>The body comes in a range of colours, modelled on Aston's various motorsport liveries, including the Le Man's British Racing Green with bright yellow accents.      </p>

<p>Aston Martin chief creative officer, Marek Reichman said: 'This was a challenge for the design team as, although the simulator isn't a car, it is inspired by our racing cars. </p>

<p>'It needed to exude the same elegance, boasting the same dynamic lines and balance of proportions as any Aston Martin with a racing lineage. </p>

<p>'I can picture the AMR-C01 in the most beautiful of residences as a sculptural work of art in its own right.' </p>

<p>AMR-C01 is primarily aimed at casual gamers with extremely deep pockets but also fully-fledged F1 drivers who want to stay sharp between race weekends</p>

<p>Just 150 are being made in a choice of different liveries to replicate Aston Martin race cars, mainly from the endurance championships</p>

<p>The design team at Aston Martin says the nose of the rig is designed to replicate that of the £2.5million Valkyrie hypercar</p>

<p>Curv Racing Simulators is led by Aston Martin works driver, Darren Turner, who is a simulator specialist with over 20 years' experience in cutting edge Formula 1 simulation. </p>

<p>'We've created a home simulator with incredible immersion that offers users the opportunity to have a great time racing in the virtual world, from the comfort of their own home,' Turner explained. </p>

<p>'Our goal was to create a simulator that provided as much enjoyment in virtual reality as real racing does. Racing cars is a lot of fun and it is great to see that with the growth of e-sports racing, more people are now getting involved.'</p>

<p>For £69,000, this is one of the pricier gaming simulators you can buy today. For the same price you could instead buy a brand new performance car...</p>

<p>For instance, the Jaguar F-Type Coupe P450 costs just £1.025 more than the Aston Martin simulator. The Jag has a  5.0-litre V8 engine with 444bhp with a top speed of 177mph</p>

<p>Buy a top-of-the-range Porsche Boxtter GTS 4.0 convertible, which has a top speed of 182mph, and it will cost you £2.660 less than the Aston Martin gaming simulator</p>

<p>At a price of £57,500 before tax and just 150 examples produced, not many more people will be able to get their hands on one.</p>

<p>Jaguar F-Type Coupe P450 with the 5.0-litre V8 engine with 444bhp, a sprint time of 4.6 seconds to 62mph and a top speed of 177mph </p>

<p>And petrol-heads will argue that £69,000 (including VAT) will buy you an incredibly competent sports car.</p>

<p>For example, for £70,025 you could instead buy a Jaguar F-Type Coupe P450 with the 5.0-litre V8 engine with 444bhp, a sprint time of 4.6 seconds to 62mph and a top speed of 177mph.</p>

<p>Alternatively, for £66,340 you can get your hands on a Porsche 718 Boxster GTS with a 394bhp 4.0-litre 6-cylinder motor, which is arguably one of the best drop-top sports cars on the market with a 0-to-62mph time of just 4.5 seconds and top speed of 182mph. </p>
