<p>Whats going on? The mystery surrounding Locky Gilbert's relationship status deepened on Monday, after photos surfaced of the Bachelor star with an unidentified blonde woman who isn't one of his remaining eight contestants</p>

<p>The source said: 'He was friendly with me, but he was with the blonde girl all night, so definitely some flirting there! He's definitely single from what I could see.' </p>
