<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A fisherman believes he hooked Britain's biggest shark - but decided against bringing the '1,200lb' monster ashore in his 32ft vessel as it was too dangerous.</p>

<p>Rob Rennie grappled with a mako shark off the West coast of Wales, bringing it alongside his boat with the help of five colleagues.</p>

<p>By estimating its length and girth, the 49-year-old has tried to make an educated guess on its weight.</p>

<p>He believes the it could weigh-in at between 800lbs and 1,200lbs - topping the current British record by nearly 300lbs.</p>

<p>But he decided against bringing the fish to shore, as that could have meant killing it.</p>

<p>The mako shark off the West coast of Wales is thought to have weighed up to 1,200lbs, fishermen estimate</p>

<p>The current British record for heaviest mako shark in British waters is 500lbs - which dates back to the 1970s</p>

<p>The current record for a rod-caught mako shark in UK waters stands at 500lbs and dates back to 1971.</p>

<p>The rules on claiming such records state the specimen must be weighed on land.</p>

<p>As this would have meant killing the shark Rob decided against this and released it back into the sea.</p>

<p>It would also not have been possible to bring it back to shore due to its sheer size and level of danger.</p>

<p>Rob Rennie, pictured, brought the shark alongside his 32ft vessel with the help of five friends </p>

<p>He managed to wrestle with the world's fastest shark, which he says is as dangerous as the Great White</p>

<p>In catching the mako Rob has become only the second fishermen in British maritime history to catch all four shark species</p>

<p>He is hoping a record can be claimed via an estimated length basis.</p>

<p>Makos are the fastest shark species in the world. They are also very aggressive and have been known to attack humans.</p>

<p>They are considered far more deadly than the three other native sharks in UK waters - the blue, porbeagle and thresher.</p>

<p>And in catching the mako Rob has become only the second fishermen in British maritime history to catch all four shark species.</p>

<p>Rob, a charter boat skipper from Hereford, said: 'Makos are dangerous - probably on par with the Great White.</p>

<p>'This one was huge.</p>

<p>'He was so big that we couldn't reel him in and had to actually drive the boat to him and pick up the slack.</p>

<p>'I would say it was at least 11ft and had an enormous girth. My guess would be that it weighed between 800lbs and 1,200lbs.</p>

<p>Rob hopes he will be able to claim the weight record by using his estimate based on the size of the shark</p>

<p>The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) has recorded 42 mako attacks on humans between 1980 and 2010, three of which were fatal</p>

<p>Rob and his fishermen friends say it would have been dangerous to bring the 11ft mako on board their 11ft vessel</p>

<p>'That would make it the biggest rod caught shark ever in British waters, which would be amazing.</p>

<p>'In days gone by claiming a record meant killing the shark which we absolutely weren't going to do.</p>

<p>'I am still hoping we can claim a record using a system based more on trusting the honesty of the skipper.</p>

<p>'I'm really pleased with it as a catch and the reaction from the fishing world has been unbelievable.'</p>

<p>The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) has recorded 42 mako attacks on humans between 1980 and 2010, three of which were fatal, along with 20 boat attacks.</p>

<p>Makos are also classified as an endangered by the IUCN. </p>
