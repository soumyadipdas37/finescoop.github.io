<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leicester and West Ham are poised to revive their interest in Djene Dakonam with Getafe ready to slash the asking price for their Togo centre-half.</p>

<p>Djene could be available for as little as £10million after helping his team finish eighth in La Liga last season.</p>

<p>Premier League clubs, including Tottenham and Arsenal, have charted his progress since he moved to Spain from Belgium in 2017, but have always been deterred by a buy-out clause set at more than £36m.</p>

<p>Djene Dakonam has been linked with a move to Premier League sides Leicester and West Ham</p>

<p>The Togo international was previously linked with moves to Tottenham and Arsenal </p>

<p>After the impact of the pandemic and having missed out on European football, Getafe are searching to generate funds in this transfer window.</p>

<p>They have agreed to listen to offers and accept the 28-year-old wants to move on to a new challenge.</p>

<p>Djene, who can also operate at right-back, would prefer a move to England.</p>

<p>Leicester and West Ham were among those who made enquiries last summer only to be put off by the cost.</p>
