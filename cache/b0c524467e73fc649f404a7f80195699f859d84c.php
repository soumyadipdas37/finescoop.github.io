<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A coalition party in Holland is calling for paid sex to be banned in a move that would be detrimental to Amsterdam's red light district.</p>

<p>The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) have revived the debate to make paying for sex a punishable offence after presenting a proposal to cabinet.</p>

<p>The proposal, submitted by CDA MP Anne Kuik, is being debated today in Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Dutch parliament, Dutch News reported.</p>

<p>Ban of paid sex will be debated by cabinet in Netherlands today after Christian Democratic Appeal called for it to become a punishable offence (pictured, Amsterdam's red light district)</p>

<p>CDA MP Anne Kuik submitted a proposal to cabinet to ban paid sex, which is being debated today in Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Dutch parliament</p>

<p>Kuik told AD newspaper: 'Most prostitutes would not actually want to have sex with the man in front of them. But it still happens, because it is paid. </p>

<p>'So consent is bought, the woman is a product. That is no longer possible in these modern times.'</p>

<p>MPs will also discuss an initiative from Christian youth movement Exxpose to curb prostitution, which has more than 50,000 signatures.</p>

<p>One of Europe's biggest brothels has filed for bankruptcy after being unable to operate for months due to coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>German daily Express reported that the Pascha brothel in Cologne had used up all of its financial reserves paying for the upkeep of its 10-storey building and 60 staff.</p>

<p>As part of a wide range of efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19, the German state of North-Rhine Westphalia, where Cologne is located, banned prostitution five months ago.</p>

<p>Organisations representing sex workers have warned that the closure of brothels is likely to force prostitution underground, where women are at greater risk of exploitation.</p>

<p>Kuik said she hopes to tackle female inequality by banning legal prostitution as she cares about the 'protection of mostly women who are treated unequally'.</p>

<p>She said: 'Ask anyone if they would want their daughter to be a sex worker and they'll say no. But we're allowing young women from Europe's poorer countries do the job without compunction. That is hypocritical.'</p>

<p>She claimed that 95 per cent of women who work in Amsterdam's red light district are from poorer Eastern European countries, according to the NL Times.</p>

<p>Kuik wants to see the Netherlands implement a legal model similar to Sweden, which criminalised paid sex back in 1999.</p>

<p>Under the Swedish Government's laws, the buyer is prosecuted but prostitutes are not. </p>

<p>Kuik argues that while it is impossible to eradicate prostitution, the Government should try to prevent it from happening.</p>

<p>She also claimed that the legalisation of prostitution has not stopped abuse on sex workers, which 'continues to exist'. </p>

<p>She added: 'And make no mistake, a lot is already happening in the Netherlands in illegality.'</p>

<p>The CDA's coalition partners D66 and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) are reportedly opposed to the ban, saying it will only drive prostitution underground.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that the chance of criminalising paid sex in the Netherlands is extremely low due to this opposition.</p>

<p>But the motion is expected to be supported by other government parties, including the SGP and ChristenUnie. </p>

<p>The two parties have rallied for the ban of paid sex for years and are supporting the revival of the debate.</p>
