<p>Joke: David Beckham, 45, played a prank on his wife Victoria Beckham, 46, as he secretly filmed her bum while she walking up a flight of stairs</p>

<p>The businessman also congratulated his fashion designer wife on her new season, telling her how proud he was of her.</p>

<p>Sharing another snap, he wrote: 'Well done ladies. So proud of <?php echo e('@'); ?>victoriabeckham &amp; <?php echo e('@'); ?>ilariaicardi working hard to make this season special.'</p>

<p>David then shared a photo of himself looking dapper as he sipped on a coffee while wearing a denim shirt and showed off his Tudor watch. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, David and Victoria were said to have caught coronavirus while splitting their time partying in the United States and the United Kingdom back at the beginning of March.</p>

<p>Cheeky: The former footballer took to his Instagram Stories and shared the clip of his other half and captioned it: 'Looking good <?php echo e('@'); ?>victoriabeckham' along with peach emojis'</p>

<p>According to a report, the couple feared they were 'super-spreaders' after several of their staff also caught the virus, following two weeks spent jetting across the globe with their children.</p>

<p>The pair split their time between the States and the UK between March 5 and 19, travelling from Los Angeles to London to the Cotswolds to Miami and then back to the Cotswolds, with no way of knowing when in their travels they contracted the virus.</p>

<p>The Beckhams began the month in Los Angeles to watch David's football club, Inter Milan FC take on Los Angeles FC in an away game.</p>

<p>The group then headed out on plenty of network and schmoozing events packed with people.</p>

<p>Success: The businessman also congratulated his fashion designer wife on her new season, telling her how proud he was of her </p>

<p>Family: Victoria shared a snap of herself with David and three of their children as she celebrated her new season </p>

<p>Days later, on March 5, the family flew into London and then travelled to their second home in the Cotswolds to celebrate son Brooklyn's 21st birthday.</p>

<p>The family held a lavish £100,000 bash on March 7 at their home, which was attended by the likes of his fiancee Nicola Peltz, Emma Bunton, Gordon and Tana Ramsay's daughter Holly and rapper Stormzy.</p>

<p>Following the party, the jet-setting family returned to the States as they travelled to Miami for the week.</p>

<p>Whilst there, David attended a swanky party attended by the likes of rapper Pharrell before overseeing business with his Inter Milan club.</p>

<p>Just a few days later, the family - excluding eldest son Brooklyn - returned to the UK to stay in their Cotswolds home on March 19, four days before the country went into lockdown.</p>

<p>Proud moment! On March 1, David was joined by Victoria and their brood when his Inter Miami team played their first game away at Los Angeles FC, in California</p>

<p>However, it is claimed that upon their return the father-of-four began to feel unwell, while Victoria developed a sore throat and a high temperature soon after.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'It was an absolute nightmare scenario,' explaining how David was in LA schmoozing on behalf of his club Inter Miami, when Victoria and their children flew over to support him.</p>

<p>'They attended a couple of swanky networking events as David had promotional duties, and were shaking hands and kissing fans and various club dignitaries,' claimed the insider.</p>

<p>The source claimed that several of the Beckhams' team, including drivers, bodyguards and PAs - also fell ill, 'a couple of them very badly so'.</p>

<p>Party time! The Beckhams headed back to the UK, where they celebrated their eldest son Brooklyn's 21st birthday with a lavish £100,000 party in the Cotswolds  on March 7 (pictured)</p>

<p>Big week! Days later David, Victoria and their children returned Stateside, this time to Miami for the launch of his MLS team (Pictured with Pharrell Williams at a Haig Club party)</p>

<p>According to the insider, Victoria 'really panicked' and forced the entire family to quarantine rigidly for more than the required two week period, defined by the UK government.</p>

<p>'She was utterly petrified they might be super-spreaders, and did all she could to minimise all future risk,' said the source.   </p>

<p>It has also been claimed that, after making full recoveries, the couple checked in regularly with their team.</p>

<p>They allegedly sent 'care packages' to at least two staff members who were particularly badly affected.</p>

<p>I'm in Miami! On March 13, David was joined by his family as he proudly showed off his new Inter Miami football stadium in Florida ahead of the first home game there</p>

<p>The Beckhams then spent lockdown quarantined in their country manor, which boasts a swimming pool, hot tub, and of course a football pitch.</p>

<p>The Beckhams defended their decision to spend lockdown in the country manor due to the fact they had already arrived there before the government issued the lockdown order on March 23.</p>

<p>Following their recovery from COVID-19, Victoria and David are said to have had swab and antibody tests to ensure they no longer had the virus, before jetting off on holiday to Greece and Italy.</p>

<p>David Beckham's representatives declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.</p>

<p>Lockdown! By March 19, the Beckhams (minus eldest child Brooklyn) were once again back in the Cotswolds, where they spent lockdown together</p>
