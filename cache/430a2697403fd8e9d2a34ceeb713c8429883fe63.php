<p>Taken by surprise when he won the award, Taron forgot to thank Elton while he was on stage and spoke about the moment on The Zoe Ball Breakfast Show.  </p>

<p>He explained: 'I do regret that, I left Elton John hanging when I was winning an award for playing Elton John. </p>

<p>'But you know what? You aren't in your right kind of mind in that moment, I also made the great faux pas of forgetting to thank the HFPA [Hollywood Foreign Press Association] who vote on the Golden Globes. </p>

<p>'You're just not thinking straight and I haven't had a lot of practice at winning awards so I didn't nail it.' </p>

<p>Taron stressed that Elton wasn't bothered by the incident, and added that 'the rest of the awards show we were holding hands.' </p>

<p>The actor's next project is the upcoming animated film Sing 2 where he will be lending his voice alongside Matthew McConaughey and Reese Witherspoon.  </p>
