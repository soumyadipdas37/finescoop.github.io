<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A crime expert has revealed why he believes secret lovers who vanished on a remote camping trip have not been murdered. </p>

<p>Russell Hill, 74, and Carol Clay, 73, went missing on March 19 in the Wonnangatta Valley in Victoria's East Gippsland region.    </p>

<p>Their disappearance baffled authorities, who found their campsite burned to the ground and Mr Hill's car slightly damaged by fire two days later.   </p>

<p>Crime editor at PodcastOne Australia, Adam Shand, said he was 'not convinced' the couple are dead.</p>

<p>'We don't know what we don't know in this case. We don't even know that they're dead,' he told A Current Affair. </p>

<p>Russell Hill (pictured left), 74, and his lover Carol Clay (right), 73, went missing during a camping trip on March 19 in the Wonnangatta Valley in Victoria's East Gippsland region </p>

<p>Crime podcaster Andrew Shand said it was assumed that the couple were murdered but he was 'not convinced' they were dead. He said authorities would have found their bodies</p>

<p>Mr Shand said many believed murder was the 'strongest theory' but there was no lead that suggested any foul play.</p>

<p>'Today we're still scratching, at least in a public sense, for a motive if there has been a killing.' </p>

<p>Mr Shand also said the couple's bodies would have been discovered if they had been killed.   </p>

<p>'You've got crows and other carrion eaters circling over those corpses. That often leads police in searches to bodies,' he explained. </p>

<p>Detectives have been consulting with interstate and global police about the investigation.</p>

<p>Police have also asked interstate travellers who were visiting the area at the time to come forward.      </p>

<p>Last month police revealed they were exploring a theory that the couple were attacked in their sleep.</p>

<p>Detectives believe the potential attackers may have torched their campsite to destroy forensic evidence of a crime. </p>

<p>Mr Hill's white Toyota Landcruiser was found with minor fire damage at their burnt campsite (pictured) near Dry River Creek Track in the valley on March 21</p>

<p>The search for Mr Hill and Ms Clay has gone international, as detectives turn to overseas and interstate experts for assistance</p>

<p>Mr Hill and Ms Clay were in a secret relationship and didn't tell anyone where they were going. </p>

<p>Ms Clay just told friends she would be gone for a few days. </p>

<p>In June, investigators said three theories about Mr Hill and Ms Clay's disappearance were being probed. </p>

<p>Foul play is strongly suspected on the balance of probabilities, but there is no evidence and no suspects.</p>

<p>Another possibility is that the couple were flying Mr Hill's $2,000 drone and died of exposure after getting lost off the path looking for it.</p>

<p>The third is that they died lost in the bush for any reason, but have not been found because wild dogs ate their remains.</p>

<p>Police are confident the pair did not fake their own deaths and do not believe it's case of murder-suicide.</p>

<p>The pair went missing in the Wonnangatta Valley, more than 200km north east of Melbourne</p>

<p>Russell Hill hangs onto a drone that he had with him when he went missing. The drone has not been found despite an extensive search of the area </p>

<p>The key to unlocking the case may have gone up in flames in a fire that destroyed their campsite. </p>

<p>Mr Hill's Toyota four-wheel-drive had been found by local police next to his burnt-out tent, but the pair were gone without a trace.</p>

<p>The vehicle itself had also sustained damage in the fire, but was still able to be driven away from the scene. </p>

<p>At the time, police had believed the fire was probably started by a dodgy phone charger or campfire spark and the couple had simply been lost in the forest. </p>

<p>But the fire could also have been lit by a thief rummaging around in the tent  - or by a murderer trying to cover their tracks. </p>

<p>A spare set of keys was found hidden on the car, but it is believed Mr Hill took the main set with him.</p>

<p>Personal belongings (circled) were left in Russell Hill's vehicle, which sustained fire damage when his tent went up in flames</p>

<p>Carol Clay, 73, who was once the President of the Country Women's Association of Victoria, had been in a relationship with Russell Hill for many years in the lead up to their disappearance</p>

<p>Mr Hill's white Toyota Landcruiser was found with minor fire damage at their burnt campsite near Dry River Creek Track in the valley on March 21</p>

<p>That the car was locked likely indicated the pair left the campsite voluntarily, probably to go for a walk or fly the drone.</p>

<p>The drone remains missing despite an extensive search that ended on April 6 without anyone finding a trace of them. </p>

<p>Mr Hill had been a keen amateur radio enthusiast and made his last broadcast from the bush on March 20. </p>

<p>Police are now certain the couple died within 18 hours after Mr Hill's last message, as a passing hiker saw the burned-out campsite about 2pm the next day.</p>

<p>Because the couple weren't due back until up to a week later, the alarm wasn't raised for days and precious time was lost.   </p>

<p>When questioned about the couple's relationship in April, Victoria Police Missing Persons Squad Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper skirted around the question. </p>

<p>'It is delicate and we are being very respectful of both families wishes and concerns here,' he said at the time.</p>

<p>Victoria Police Missing Persons Squad Detective Inspector Andrew Stamper is leading the investigation into the mystery </p>

<p>Russell Hill and Carol Clay were last heard from on March 20, with Mr Hill's wife unaware he was travelling with another woman</p>
