<p>QPR have moved into pole position to sign Benfica's former Arsenal prospect Chris Willock</p>

<p>Benfica had accepted an offer from Huddersfield Town for the 22 year-old winger</p>

<p>Willock spent the second half of last season on loan at Huddersfield and they were keen to make the move permanent.</p>

<p>But the door remained open for his rival suitors, including QPR, who were also monitoring the situation while Huddersfield attempted to negotiate his contract.</p>

<p>Willock, who played for England from Under 16 through to U 20 level, made 14 appearances for Huddersfield, including eight starts, scoring twice. </p>

<p>Willock started out in Arsenal's youth ranks before moving to Benfica in the summer of 2017</p>

<p>Willock is the brother of current Arsenal midfielder Joe, 21, and Gillingham midfielder Matty, 24, with all three starting out in the Gunners' youth ranks. </p>

<p>Chris made two first team appearances in the League Cup in 2016 before being snapped up by Benfica the following summer, making 64 appearances for their B-team in Portugal's second tier, scoring 14 times and recording nine assists. </p>

<p>Willock began last season on loan at West Brom before joining Huddersfield in January.</p>
