<p>Tony Williams, 75, often goes for days without speaking to anyone after his wife Jo, also 75, passed away in May.</p>

<p>The retired physicist, who lives in Alton, East Hampshire, has no children and said he often sits at home willing the phone to ring 'but it never does' - and he said he feels 'cursed' by loneliness.</p>

<p>Without any family nearby, Mr Williams put two adverts in his local newspaper looking for a friend to chat to, but didn't get any replies.</p>

<p>Tony Williams, 75, often goes for days without speaking to anyone after his wife Jo, also 75, passed away in May</p>

<p>So in a bid to find a friend to listen to music with, or sit in the garden alongside, he had business cards made, to hand out when he went to the supermarket or out for a walk.</p>

<p>He handed out dozens without receiving a call back, so has now put a poster up in his window asking for pals.</p>

<p>He said: 'It's my last resort. I've tried everything to make friends, but it feels like nobody wants to talk to me.</p>

<p>The retired physicist, who lives in Alton, East Hampshire, has no children and said he often sits at home willing the phone to ring 'but it never does' - and he said he feels 'cursed' by loneliness</p>

<p>'Not very many people pass my house, but I was hoping it would spread around the community, and someone might reach out.</p>

<p>'Jo was my best friend and we had a lovely life. But now I'm all by myself. My wonderful wife has just died, and I have nobody.</p>

<p>'All I want is for somebody to see the sign and phone me up. I just want a nice conversation so I'm not sat in silence all day long.</p>

<p>Without any family nearby, Mr Williams put two adverts in his local newspaper looking for a friend to chat to, but didn't get any replies</p>

<p>'I'm not looking for someone to listen to me cry - I just want a normal person who I can chat to! I can talk to anybody about anything.</p>

<p>'I spend most days just sat in the house in silence, just waiting for the phone to ring * but it never does.'</p>

<p>Mr Williams met Jo, a legal secretary, in a bar more than 35 years ago, and their marriage was 'perfect harmony'.</p>

<p>The couple were unable to have any children, and lived in Kempley, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, for 25 years.</p>

<p>'We first met one night in a bar, and we got on so well,' Mr Williams added.</p>

<p>'It was just incredible. It was like I'd known her all my life. She was just so lovely.</p>

<p>He had friendship business cards made, to hand out when he went to the supermarket or out for a walk but never received a call back</p>

<p>'Our relationship was always so natural. We had no secrets and we could be totally open with each other - we really were soul mates.</p>

<p>'Back in Kempley, we both used to get in every evening from work and cook together - with me doing one job and her another - then we'd put it together at the end.</p>

<p>'Sometimes we'd spend hours cooking, laughing and listening to music together - it was the highlight of our day.</p>

<p>'We also had a huge, beautiful garden with an orchard. In the summer months, I'd do the gardening and Jo would come and sit outside with me. Everything was just perfect.'</p>

<p>They moved to near Alton, East Hampshire, last year so Jo could be closer to her sister, Beryl, 73.</p>

<p>Mr Williams met Jo, a legal secretary, in a bar more than 35 years ago, and their marriage was 'perfect harmony'</p>

<p>But Jo fell ill, with what turned out to be pancreatic cancer, shortly after they moved, and died suddenly, just nine days after the diagnosis.</p>

<p>Jo passed away at home, with Mr Williams by her side, in May, and he said he has lived in near silence ever since.</p>

<p>He said: 'Now I'm here, completely alone, in the house where my lovely wife spent her dying days.</p>

<p>'Every time I walk in the room, the first thing I do is look at her photograph.'</p>

<p>Mr Williams's neighbours said they have offered to help him - but the OAP said he's after a friend his own age to pass the time.</p>

<p>Mr Williams's neighbours said they have offered to help him - but the OAP said he's after a friend his own age to pass the time</p>

<p>His quest for companionship began by placing two adverts, costing £120 in total, in the local newspaper, seeking a friend - but he had no success.</p>

<p>He began handing around printed cards with his details on whenever he visited the supermarket or went for a walk - but gave out 23 without receiving a single call back.</p>

<p>The sign he put up in his window last week, said: 'I have lost Jo, my lovely wife and soul mate. I have no friends and nobody to talk to.</p>

<p>'I find the unremitting silence 24-hours-a-day unbearable torture. Can nobody help me?'</p>

<p>Tony said he isn't close to his late wife's family, and his own three siblings live far away.</p>

<p>He added: 'I just want a friend, and I hope my sign will find someone for me.'</p>
