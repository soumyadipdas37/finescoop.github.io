<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A fresh twist in the case of a carer charged with manslaughter over a disabled woman's death was a witness to her final will, it has been revealed. </p>

<p>Ann Marie Smith died in the Royal Adelaide Hospital on April 6 from septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores and malnourishment. </p>

<p>The 54-year-old, who had cerebral palsy and relied on NDIS support, was allegedly left to rot in her own excrement by 69-year-old carer Rosemary Maione. </p>

<p>Maione was a key witness to Ms Smith's last will and testament which was also signed by a solicitor and dated December 18, 2013, The Advertiser reported.   </p>

<p>Ann Marie Smith (pictured), 54, died at Royal Adelaide Hospital in April from septic shock, multiple organ failure, severe pressure sores and malnourishment</p>

<p>Carer Rosemary Maione (pictured), 69, was charged with manslaughter over Ms Smith's death. She was a key witness on the 54-year-old's last will and testament </p>

<p>Ms Smith (pictured) died after allegedly being left to rot in her own waste at at her home </p>

<p>Police have also alleged Ms Smith's jewellery was taken, her money was stolen and she was left in the same cane chair for 12 months.  </p>

<p>Ms Smith's uncle, Glen Smith, said he was not aware of any earlier wills and spoke out about the lack of financial safeguards protecting society's vulnerable people.   </p>

<p>'How can a carer be a witness to the will of the person they are taking care of?' he said. </p>

<p>Mr Smith explained his niece died with $150 in her bank account and had debts exceeding $80,000 despite a $325,000 inheritance from her father in 2009. </p>

<p>Ms Smith's final will left her entire estate to former carers and friends, but did not include Maione.   </p>

<p>Two carers and a female friend were set to receive $2,000 and two male friends would be given Ms Smith's jewellery and pets.</p>

<p>One of the men, Ms Smith's former school friend aged in his 50s, was an executor to her will and initiated probate, seeking to distribute her estate, on July 8. </p>

<p>South Australian police have released photos from inside Ms Smith's home where she sat in her final days. The 54-year-old was allegedly left in the same chair for 12 months </p>

<p>Maione (left) will remain under home detention until she appears in court in April next year</p>

<p>He was set to receive the remainder of Ms Smith's estate, including her purpose-built Kensington Park house currently on the market for $929,000. </p>

<p>Mr Smith said the oversight made by Maione's employer Integrity Care SA as well as the NDIS and state and federal governments had been an 'astounding failure'.  </p>

<p>'How can probate begin when all the investigations are continuing, including her finances? It's simply beggars belief,' he said. </p>

<p>Mr Smith said safeguards were needed around witnesses signing legal documents for disabled, elderly and vulnerable people. </p>

<p>A police spokesman said Ms Smith's will had been viewed by police and no further comment could be made with the case before the courts.</p>

<p>An investigation into Ms Smith's death and financial affairs is ongoing.</p>

<p>Maione was granted bail to remain under home detention and will appear in Adelaide Magistrates Court in April 2021. </p>

<p>The 54-year-old lived alone in her Adelaide home (pictured) and relied on carers under the National Disability Insurance Scheme </p>
