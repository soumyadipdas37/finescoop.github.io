<p>Elsa added that she had always dreamed of raising her children in nature, and relocating to the Australian coast allowed her to do that.</p>

<p>'I wanted to pick my kids up, I wanted to take them to school, I wanted to be part of the school and be involved in what they do,' she said. </p>

<p>Life in Byron Bay has also allowed Elsa to have a farm with horses, which she regularly rides with her daughter, India.</p>

<p>She explained: 'When we were trying to find a property, I had to have a place where I could have horses and my kids could be with them and enjoy that, too.'</p>

<p>Having lived in the quiet community since 2014, the Fast and Furious star now feels 'privileged' to enjoy such a beautiful life.</p>

<p>Chris and Elsa share three children, daughter India Rose, eight, and twin sons Tristan and Sasha, six.</p>
