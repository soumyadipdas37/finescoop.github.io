<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A brawl - among other things - busted out over a cell phone at a Waffle House in the US over the weekend. </p>

<p>'You can always count on waffle house,' wrote the Twitter user who posted the now-viral video Saturday. </p>

<p>In the video, three patrons - a woman in yellow, a woman with flaming red hair and a man - are seen in the middle of yelling at a Waffle House employee who is asking them to pay their bill.   </p>

<p>As the man demands his 'god**n phone' - which the restaurant employees appear to be in custody of - the yellow-clad woman tells a worker to hand over the phone.</p>

<p>'Ring that one up so we can pay for that one and then you can put up that phone,' the woman says. </p>

<p>A wild brawl broke out at a Waffle House in the US. The customers apparently wanted workers to return a cell phone, while workers wanted the patrons to pay their bill</p>

<p>When neither side agrees to do as asked, the male patron storms around the counter and tries to get the phone himself, only to be manhandled by one of the Waffle House employees. </p>

<p>At that point, the red-haired woman and the lady in yellow storm around the counter and enter the fray. </p>

<p>Within moments, fists, elbows and bared breasts start flying during the increasingly violent fight, which involved the three patrons and at least three Waffle House workers. </p>

<p>While other patrons whip out their cell phones to record the incident, the red haired woman is picked up off her feet by a Waffle House employee, while the man and another worker tussle on the ground. Another person who may have been part of the group stands off to the side. </p>

<p>As a female Waffle House employee is apparently calling the police, the woman in yellow reaches out and grabs the phone out of her hand. </p>

<p>The two women then begin fighting. </p>

<p>While punching the female worker, the yellow-clan woman's wig flies off and the top of her tank top rolls down, giving shocked onlookers an eyeful.   </p>

<p>A video captured the customers arguing with a Waffle House employee (left), before the male customer (right) went around the counter and tried to grab the phone himself</p>

<p>During the fight, the red-haired customer is picked up off her feet by a worker (left). The yellow-clad worker is seen moments after her wig flew off</p>

<p>'We gotta go, we got coke! 'We gotta get our phone and we gotta go,' the woman in yellow says, adjusting her top after she stops punching the Waffle House worker. </p>

<p>'Get off me wh**e! Get the hell off me, b***h!' she yells at the female Waffle House worker who is holding on tight to her leg. </p>

<p>In the background, the male patron gets grabbed in a headlock by the original Waffle House worker. </p>

<p>'Put the boy to sleep, yo!' an onlooker shouts out, referencing a sleeper hold, which is commonly seen in pro-wrestling matches. </p>

<p>A second video, which also popped up on social media, shows the moment when the fight ends and the three patrons move to leave the establishment. </p>

<p>The redhaired woman can be seen holding the yellow-clad woman's lost wig, as the woman herself continues to yell about leaving and demands the phone's return. </p>

<p>Social media users have speculated that prior to the video beginning, the customers had attempted to dine-and-dash, but that one of them left behind a phone, so they had to return to pay their bill. </p>

<p>It's unclear whether any of the three patrons who started the altercation will face charges or in which state the fight took place - only one worker appears to be wearing a face mask, while none of the patrons are. </p>
