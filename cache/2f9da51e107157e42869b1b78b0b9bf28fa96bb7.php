<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mummy blogger has revealed the hilarious excuse her husband gave when their children walked in on them during intercourse. </p>

<p>Jessica Hood, 31, from Melbourne, shared the excruciating moment she was caught 'mid-thrust' by her curious kids.</p>

<p>She published the dirty details to her 54,000 followers on her Instagram account 'House of Hoods'.</p>

<p>'Its 9.30pm on a Wednesday what could possibly go wrong?. Little bit of nookie never hurt anyone right?' she began. </p>

<p>But within seconds everything changed and she heard the door creak and saw the hall light shining on her face.</p>

<p>Mother-of-four Jessica Hood said her kids walked in on her having sex with her husband at home</p>

<p>Ms Hood said her legs were 'sky high' when the children opened the door to her bedroom</p>

<p>At the time her legs were 'sky high' with her husband's 'pasty' behind blocking her from view.   </p>

<p>'I thought my heart couldn't race any faster during such an intimate moment but now I'm on the verge of cardiac arrest,' she said.   </p>

<p>In her panic Ms Hood said she froze in horror.  </p>

<p>'My mum instinct kicked in and I did what anyone else would do in a situation like that. I played dead,' she said. </p>

<p>'I even threw a little bit of the tongue out the side of my mouth. Lost my dignity and any sense I had too during my most valuable time.</p>

<p>'Reaching around for a blanket Karl flew over me like batman with his cape, hiding any evidence of the act.' </p>

<p>The young mum said she was hopeful they had been quick enough to cover up to avoid the kids needing 'therapy for life'.  </p>

<p> Ms Hood and her husband Karl were caught in the act and were quick to make excuses for what they were up to</p>

<p>She told her fans she was so shocked she thought she going into cardiac arrest</p>

<p>Until the children asked what they were doing.  </p>

<p>'We are play fighting, I'm giving mummy a massage,' he husband said.  </p>

<p>But when the kids were told to go to bed, their muffled giggles could be overheard from the corridor. </p>

<p>'I heard Lily walking off with Logan up the hallway , she * giggles * mum and dad were doing sex,' she said.</p>

<p>'Then Logan let's out a big laugh. Just wonderful! I've scarred my kids for life, either that or I've set them up for a life of 'blackmailing Mummy and Daddy'. </p>

<p>The mother-of-four said she was hopeful her kids would forget the whole experience. </p>

<p>'Tomorrow will be an interesting day. I plan to act like nothing happened and stick to 'story',' she said, adding 'if all else fails I could just play dead … right?' </p>

<p> The mother-of-four said she was hopeful her kids would forget the whole experience</p>
