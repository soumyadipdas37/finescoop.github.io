<p>And on Friday, Pip Edwards opted for a classy black and white ensemble for a night out with friends.</p>

<p>One could mistake the 40-year-old P.E. Nation founder's outfit for something inspired by a nun's habit - but it was far from it.</p>

<p>Simply divine! Fashion designer Pip Edwards (pictured) looked stylish in a classy black and white ensemble for a night out on Friday</p>

<p>She posted a mirror selfie of her outfit - a long black dress with a white neckline trim and cut out details on the waist.</p>

<p>Over the dress, the fashion designer wore a cropped bomber jacket and completed her look with a pair of white boots.</p>

<p>Pip's avant garde ensemble comes after she recently shared a sweet photo of herself cuddled up to her boyfriend, cricketer Michael Clarke.</p>

<p>Pip was barefoot in the impressive closet, wearing a pair of baggy casual black trousers and a white tank top.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michael was sporty in black shorts, an olive green T-shirt and Off White Nike sneakers.</p>
