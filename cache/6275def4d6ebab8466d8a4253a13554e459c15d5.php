<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 46-year-old woman has died during Brazilian butt lift surgery in Miami, making her at least the 20th fatality in Florida linked to the risky procedure in the last decade.  </p>

<p>Gia Romualdo-Rodriguez died this week from an embolism caused by the fat injected into her buttocks at the Xiluet clinic in Miami. </p>

<p>Romualdo-Rodriguez's death was ruled accidental by the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner's Office Thursday.</p>

<p>This marks the latest in a string of deaths connected to the dangerous surgery as people risk their lives on the operating table to get their idea of the perfect butt. </p>

<p>Gia Romualdo-Rodriguez, 46, died during Brazilian butt lift surgery in Miami this week, making her at least the 20th fatality in Florida linked to the risky procedure in the last decad</p>

<p>Romualdo-Rodriguez, a Mexican who was living in College Point, New York, traveled to Miami for the surgery at the clinic that is known for breast enhancements, tummy tucks and Brazilian butt lifts.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old, who is transitioning to be a woman and was also undergoing breast-enhancement surgery, was being operated on by Dr. Stephanie Stover. </p>

<p>Stover is certified with the American Board of Plastic Surgery and does not have any history of disciplinary action.   </p>

<p>During the surgery, Romualdo-Rodriguez's oxygen levels and heart rate plummeted and Stover dialled 911, reported The Miami Herald.</p>

<p>She was rushed to Kendall Regional Hospital where she was pronounced dead, police said. </p>

<p>Romualdo-Rodriguez died this week from an embolism caused by the fat injected into her buttocks at the Xiluet clinic in Miami</p>

<p>Romualdo-Rodriguez's friend Liz Chavez, 37, told the Herald Romualdo-Rodriguez had struggled in Mexico because she was transgender but, after two decades living in the US, had been 'living her best life'.  </p>

<p>Dr. Stephanie Stover was operating on Romualdo-Rodriguez</p>

<p>'She had always felt like a girl, from an early age. She struggled a lot with discrimination from her family that didn't want to accept it,' Chavez said. </p>

<p>'For people in Mexico, it's really hard to be transgender.'  </p>

<p>Chavez said her friend was prominent in the transgender community in New York City and worked with outreach groups including Make the Road New York and Colectivo Intercultural Transgrediendo. </p>

<p>She paid tribute to her 'confident' and 'beautiful' friend.     </p>

<p>At least 20 deaths have been linked to complications from butt lift surgery in Florida in the last decade, reported the Herald.</p>

<p>Most of these deaths took place in Miami. </p>

<p>The Xiluet clinic in Miami (above) Romualdo-Rodriguez's death is the latest in a string of deaths connected to the risky surgery in Florida</p>

<p>In 2019, the Florida Board of Medicine issued new rules about the surgery in the wake of a string of deaths. </p>

<p>The procedure involves fat being removed from the patient's stomach and then injected into the buttocks.   </p>

<p>The new rules ban surgeons from injecting fat into or below a patients gluteal muscles, or glutes, because this poses a high risk of piercing the gluteal vein. </p>

<p>Hitting the vein can cause fat clots to travel to the heart and lungs, causing organ failure. </p>

<p>Instead, surgeons must now inject the fat above the muscle and below the skin.  </p>

<p>However, three deaths from fat clots have happened since the new rules went into place.   </p>
