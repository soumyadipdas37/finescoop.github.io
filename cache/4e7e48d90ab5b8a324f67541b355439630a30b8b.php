<p>Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack will on Wednesday announce a new regional recovery fund, part of $135million in spending to be outlined in next week's budget.</p>

<p>The program will be targeted at regions suffering after drought, bushfires and the pandemic, as well as areas primed for economic diversification.</p>

<p>Bushfire and coronavirus-ravaged parts of regional Australia will share in $100million of Commonwealth cash over the next two years.Â Victoria's Gippsland region (pictured) is included</p>

<p>In NSW, the Snowy Mountains, Hunter-Newcastle and Parkes regions will be eligible.</p>

<p>Victoria's Gippsland region is included, along with Cairns, Gladstone, Mackay-Isaac-Whitsunday and the tropical north in Queensland.</p>

<p>All of Tasmania, South Australia's Kangaroo Island and Western Australia's South West are covered.</p>

<p>Mr McCormack said the money would be used to support recovery and growth through projects co-ordinated with other levels of governments.</p>

<p>'These partnerships will support existing regional plans by developing a package of targeted initiatives to deliver jobs, economic recovery and economic diversification,' the Nationals leader said.</p>

<p>Labor leader Anthony Albanese has accused the government of not doing enough to fuel regional job creation in the aftermath of the horror summer.</p>

<p>'We need to have a plan as well in terms of immediate jobs for issues like land care and for looking after areas that were impacted by the bushfires,' he told Triple M radio on Tuesday.</p>

<p>He said none of the $200million earmarked in for an emergency response fund flowed during the last financial year.</p>

<p>'That could have been spent supporting those areas and resilience, but also creating jobs,' Mr Albanese said.</p>

<p>The deputy prime minister will outline the new measures in a speech to the Regional Australia Institute on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The package also includes an extra $30million for telecommunications projects outside of national broadband network fixed-line areas.</p>

<p>That will make the Regional Connectivity Program worth $83million.</p>

<p>A further $5million will be spent on developing local leaders in the regions, including councillors, volunteers, members of community organisations and industries.</p>

<p>'These measures are all part of our economic plan for a more secure and resilient Australia, helping the regions bounce back and then thrive, to drive Australia's economic recovery,' Mr McCormack said.</p>
