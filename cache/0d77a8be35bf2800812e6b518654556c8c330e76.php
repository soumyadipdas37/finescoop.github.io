<p>Disturbing: Kanye West posted and deleted this message on Twitter early on Friday morning</p>

<p>A source recently told People that Kanye is 'off his meds' and wife Kim is 'at the end of her rope - again'.</p>

<p>'The last time, part of his negotiation with Kim was that he'd get back on his medication and he would work very hard to control his impulses,' the source told the outlet. 'He made a lot of promises. And now those promises are broken, less than a month later.</p>

<p>'It's the same thing over and over and over again. He's on very thin ice with her right now, and she's truly trying to decide what to do to protect the kids, but also her own sanity.' </p>

<p>Alarming: Kardashian's slideshow come just one day after her husband left fans concerned, after he shared a disturbing tweet about having his eldest daughter taken away from him</p>

<p>The source added that Kim 'wants to be a supportive partner, she's doing everything she can do to support him'. However, they add that Kanye has to support himself and take care of his own health.</p>

<p>'For such a powerful woman, she feels very powerless, and she hates it,' the source said. 'She loves Kanye very much, and he just doesn't realize how much pain he's causing her.'</p>

<p>Kanye first acknowledged his bipolar disorder in 2018, a condition that is associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs and can be controlled with medication.</p>

<p>Kim hinted last month that his struggle with bipolar was to blame for his recent erratic behavior, that has seen him embark on the unlikely bid for presidency and get emotional at his first campaign rally in South Carolina while discussing abortion.</p>
