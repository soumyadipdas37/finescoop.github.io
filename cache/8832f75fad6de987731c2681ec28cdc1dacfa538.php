<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A police officer who yelled 'chill out or I'll choke you out' while holding a suspect in a headlock is under criminal investigation, a watchdog has said. </p>

<p>Shocking footage - which has since gone viral on social media - shows an officer pushing Hassan Ahmed, 27, up against a car in Halifax, West Yorkshire on August 16.</p>

<p>He then pulls Ahmed to the ground on a road while arresting him on suspicion of assault.</p>

<p>Footage showed the man waving his hand across his throat during the arrest - as if complaining that he couldn't breathe.</p>

<p>In the clip, the officer appears to shout: 'Chill out or I'll choke you out. Chill out, or you're going to sleep. Chill out, chill out.'</p>

<p>A police officer who yelled 'chill out or I'll choke you out' while holding a suspect in a headlock (pictured) is under criminal investigation, a watchdog has said </p>

<p>Around 100 people attended a protest outside Halifax police station in the days after the arrest, including Mr Ahmed's sister Safyah, who said she was 'sickened' by what had happened.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, watchdog the Independent Office for Police Conduct said the officer is under a criminal and gross misconduct investigation.</p>

<p>He had already been suspended. </p>

<p>IOPC regional director Miranda Biddle said: 'Having examined a range of evidence, including body-worn video and initial accounts from the officers involved in the restraint, we have taken the decision that this is now a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>'A criminal investigation does not mean that criminal charges will necessarily follow.'</p>

<p>A man claiming to be the arrested person told MailOnline that it felt like a 'racist attack for being a British Asian'. </p>

<p>The trouble flared in August when an officer parked up their marked police van to arrest the man on suspicion of assault.</p>

<p>One of the officers shouted: 'Chill out or I'll choke you out. Chill out, or you're going to sleep'</p>

<p>Earlier in the incident the officer pushed him up against a car before pulling him to the ground</p>

<p>He was filmed flinging the man, wearing black cycling shorts, into into the back of a van as he pleaded: 'Look. What have I done?' </p>

<p>The officer then appeared to grab the man around the neck and wrestled him to the ground on a zebra crossing between roadworks before placing him in an arm lock.</p>

<p>The officer was then heard telling the man to 'chill out or I will choke you out' as a colleague moves in to assistant in the arrest.</p>

<p>Both officers, wearing yellow high visibility vests, were seen to kneel on the man before the first one bellowed: 'Turn over. Turn over. Now.'</p>

<p>The officer then flipped the man over onto his stomach. Both officers then pinned his arms behind his back and knelt on his shoulders while radioing for back up.  </p>
