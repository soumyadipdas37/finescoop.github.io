<p>She added of her depression: 'It’s not always easy, if you have mental issues, to let other people see. I used to show. I used to self-harm. I used to say, "Look. I cut myself. See, I’m hurt." Cause I didn’t think anyone could see. Cause mental health, it’s invisible.'</p>

<p>Gaga (whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta) also opened up about the mental trauma that comes with fame, while showing off her at-home recording studio.  </p>

<p>The Born This Way artist continued: 'That's what I was thinking. My biggest enemy is here. "What did you do? You can't go to the grocery store now. If you go to dinner with your family, somebody comes to the table... It's always about you. And your outfits, look at your outfits! Why you gotta be like that?!"'</p>

<p>The Stupid Love artist said: 'I don't hate Lady Gaga anymore. I found a way to love myself again, even when I thought that was never gonna happen.</p>

<p>'Now I look at this piano and I go, "Oh, my god, my piano! My piano that I love so much; my piano that lets me speak; my piano that lets me make poetry; my piano that's mine."' </p>

<p>Gaga previously touched on her mental health struggles in making Chromatica, telling Apple Music in May: 'I've flirted with the idea of sobriety. I'm not there yet, but I flirted with it throughout the album. It's something that came up as a result of me trying to work through the pain that I was feeling.</p>

<p>'But part of my healing process was going, "Well, I can either lash the hell out of myself every day for continuing to drink, or I can just be happy that I'm still alive and keep going and feel good enough." I am good enough... I'm perfectly imperfect.'</p>
