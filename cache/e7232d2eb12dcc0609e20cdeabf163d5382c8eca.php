<p>Discussing the pandemic, Denise said: 'I'm not saying this is over. I'm not saying how horrendous this virus is and was.</p>

<p>'But at the moment we have a one in 2million chance of dying of Covid and I have a one in three chance of getting cancer. So can the government please tell us the proper statistics?'</p>

<p>Having his say: Good Morning Britain host Piers was quick to share his views as he reacted to Denise's impassioned appearance on the show</p>

<p>The debate, which also included Dr Sara Kayat, saw Denise also talk about people's mental health and the fact that people who suffer from the likes of cancer and heart disease were failing to receive the treatment they needed. </p>

<p>Turning to Dr Sara for her opinion, Eamonn said of Denise: 'She's not extremely right-ring on all of this.'</p>

<p>To which Denise immediately snapped: 'Extremely right-wing? I'm not remotely right-wing, Eamonn.'</p>

<p>With Denise's passion clearly showing through, Eamonn interjected: 'I'm only using your quote back at you, right? Just calm down, right?'</p>
