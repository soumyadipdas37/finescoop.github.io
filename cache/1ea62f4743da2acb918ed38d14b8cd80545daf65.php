<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>MasterChef's Ben Ungermann has declared he 'knows his self-worth' in his latest social media post since being accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old was charged with three counts of sexual assault by Victorian sexual crime squad detectives on March 6 over an alleged incident with a 16-year-old girl on February 23.</p>

<p>Ungermann, who denies the allegations and will defend the charges, had been in Melbourne for the filming of MasterChef: Back to Win program.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, Ungermann shared an introspective Instagram post about his experiences over the past couple of months.</p>

<p>The former MasterChef contestant was removed from the show after he was charged with sexually assaulting a teenage girl</p>

<p>The chef's tattoos were on show as he sat topless from a cliff-edge and looked out to the ocean. </p>

<p>'The ocean is a place I find soothing for quiet contemplation,' Ungermann wrote.</p>

<p>'In the last few months people have had a lot to say about me without knowing me or my circumstances.' </p>

<p>'But if I have learnt anything about myself in recent months, is that I am much stronger than people think.   </p>

<p>Ungermann concluded by saying he is looking forward to change in his life.  </p>

<p>'I know my self-worth and I know the person I am and I'm looking forward to a change of scenery,' he wrote.  </p>

<p>Ungermann also included the hashtags 'you are enough', 'growth', 'fresh start' and 'new beginnings'. </p>

<p>In June, Ungermann's lawyer Sarah Condon told the Melbourne Magistrates Court via video link that Ungermann intended to fight the charges.</p>

<p>Court documents state police allege Ungermann intentionally touched his alleged victim without her consent at least three times.</p>

<p>One of the charges includes graphic detail of one of the alleged attacks against the young girl.</p>

<p>The teenage girl alleges that on Sunday February 23, Ungermann 'sexually touched her right breast skin-to-skin' against her wishes.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Stephen Payne said police intended to call four child witnesses to give evidence against Ungermann - each of them from interstate.</p>

<p>Ungermann shared an Instagram post about his strength on March 20</p>

<p>Both Ungermann's defence and prosecutors argued against releasing details of the alleged offence to the public.</p>

<p>Magistrate Marita Altman agreed, releasing only the charge sheets to media. </p>

<p>In May, top criminal lawyer Adam Houda told Daily Mail Australia his client was completely blindsided by the charges.</p>

<p>'My client is distressed by the charges, which came as a huge shock to him,' he said.</p>

<p>'The allegations, I am instructed, are a complete fabrication and are denied.' </p>

<p>Ungermann was dropped from MasterChef once producers learned of his arrest.</p>

<p>Fans had first noticed Ungermann had disappeared from MasterChef: Back to Win when he didn't appear on an episode with U.S. singer Katy Perry.</p>

<p>It was only on days later that Scottish-born restaurateur Jock Zonfrillo announced for the first time that Ungermann had left the competition for a 'personal matter' and would not be returning.</p>
