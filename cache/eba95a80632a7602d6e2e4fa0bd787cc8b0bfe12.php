<p>Speaking about her eviction, the media buyer told Who magazine that being sent home during 'love in lockdown' was a bizarre and lonely experience. </p>

<p>'I don't recommend it to anyone... There's a red rose just staring at you and then you just close the laptop,' she said. </p>

<p>'Obviously, it's better to be with everyone because you can hug everyone goodbye and have a moment with Locky if you need it for that closure,' she added.</p>

<p>Bel, who was at her home on the night she was sent packing, only had her producer to turn to for comfort after being abruptly cut off the Zoom call.</p>

<p>Brutal: 'I don't recommend it to anyone... There's a red rose just staring at you and then you just close the laptop,' Bel (right) told Who magazine of her elimination. Pictured during Thursday's rose ceremony, which took place over Zoom</p>

<p>'It was nice, he sat with me in the house afterwards and asked me if I was okay,' she said.</p>

<p>At the end of last Thursday's episode, the series' first-ever virtual rose ceremony saw each of the remaining ladies standing by a rose.</p>

<p>However, they could only pick it up if Locky called out their name.</p>

<p>After Bel failed to receive a rose, she waved goodbye to the other ladies before her screen abruptly blanked out.</p>
