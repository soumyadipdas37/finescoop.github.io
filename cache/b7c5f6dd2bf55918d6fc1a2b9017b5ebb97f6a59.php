<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Exactly one month ago, Thiago Silva was playing in a Champions League Final for Paris Saint-Germain trying to keep Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski quiet.</p>

<p>The whole world was watching as the Brazilian centre-back's side came within a whisker of winning the best club competition in football.</p>

<p>Yet as Silva prepares for his next challenge with Chelsea, the scene couldn't be any more different. He will make his Blues bow in an empty stadium broadcasted on the Carabao energy drinks website, while the threat of the treble-winning Bundesliga side is now Barnsley - without a league win or a goal so far this season.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva (R) kept Robert Lewandowski (L) in the Champions League final four weeks ago</p>

<p>The defender is set to make his Chelsea debut in Wednesday's Carabao Cup tie with Barnsley </p>

<p>The side sitting 20th in the Championship travel to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night for their third-round Carabao Cup clash with the Blues, with Silva likely to mark Tykes forward Conor Chaplin - a far cry from the 55-goal Bayern Munich striker he faced in Libson.</p>

<p>The former PSG captain moved to west London from Paris Saint-Germain earlier this summer as part of Lampard's £200million overhaul of the Chelsea squad.</p>

<p>While focus will be placed on the mega-money attacking talent the club have signed, namely German duo Timo Werner and Kai Havertz, it is the free purchase of Silva that could make the biggest difference at the Bridge. </p>

<p>In his trophy-laden career, Silva has won league titles at every European side he's played in. He won Serie A in 2011, a feat the club has not managed since, while he won the Ligue 1 title in seven out of his eight top-flight campaigns in France. </p>

<p>Silva was within touching distance of lifting a Champions League trophy in Lisbon last month</p>

<p>Now Silva is thinking about how to mark Barnsley striker Connor Chaplin on Wednesday night </p>

<p>He also has experience at winning at international level, lifting both the FIFA Confederations Cup and the Copa America with Brazil in 2013 and 2019 respectively. </p>

<p>There are, of course, question marks over whether he is still capable of producing at the highest level at 36 years of age. Those fears, however, are not shared with the player himself.  </p>

<p>Speaking to the media ahead of his debut, Silva said: 'Age is just a number on your document. I don't worry it at all.</p>

<p>'Physically, I feel very young and I'm very well prepared for this. People who know me know how much I love my work; how I put in 200%.'</p>

<p>The Brazilian (middle) will still bring title-winning experience at club level to Stamford Bridge</p>

<p>For Lampard, Silva's main addition to the Chelsea squad will be defensive consistency, an aspect which has been hard to come by in the blue half of west London in recent months.</p>

<p>Despite having the likes of Kurt Zouma, Andreas Christensen, Fikayo Tomori as centre-half options, Chelsea have failed to nail down a regular centre-back partnership. </p>

<p>This clear issue for Lampard has led to poor defensive performances in big games this calendar year, such as the 3-2 defeat to West Ham, the FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal and even Sunday's defeat to Liverpool.</p>

<p>There are also leadership qualities that Silva can bring, with the player having played a senior role at every club he has been at. Cesar Azpilicueta has been dropped from the squad and Silva is expected to wear the armband in his absence. </p>

<p>Despite only just joining the club, Lampard believes a leadership role at Stamford Bridge suits the Brazilian defender just fine.  </p>

<p>Frank Lampard (above) believes Silva will bring defensive stability and leadership to the club</p>

<p>The Chelsea boss added: 'Thiago Silva is a leader and I spoke to lots of people that have worked with him before he came and everybody said the same thing: he has an absolute commitment to being a winner, to helping his team-mates, to improving all the time.</p>

<p>'I loved his statements about winning and winning and winning. But they’re easy to make those statements. It's about how you train and your actions. </p>

<p>'He gives off the feeling of someone who will affect people around him, organise people around him and drive the team. Someone like Thiago will massively help in terms how they hold themselves day to day and how players around them look up to them.' </p>

<p>When the defender arrived as one of PSG's marquee signings in 2012, the French side were similar in stature to Chelsea as the ambitious pretenders. </p>

<p>The Chelsea head coach thinks Silva (left)'s presence will help other plays play to their best</p>

<p>The 36-year-old is an experienced defender having led his club and country to trophies</p>

<p>Back then, PSG were spending lots of money but were not quite good enough to be league champions. They had just lost the 2011-12 league title to Montpellier despite the abundance of riches at their disposal, with a clear leader needed at the club. </p>

<p>Though the Brazilian steadied the ship and PSG exerted their dominance on French domestic football. Other players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Angel di Maria, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe have all helped - but they didn't bring in Silva's leadership qualities. </p>

<p>The thought taking Chelsea to the top is perhaps an argument for later in the Brazilian defender's career.</p>

<p>For now, Barnsley awaits for Silva - with fans expecting to see a more robust Blues side on Wednesday night. </p>
