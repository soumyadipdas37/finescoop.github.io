<p>'If I could go back in time, I would tell myself to worry less and enjoy more,' Gibson said.</p>

<p>'I always was a perfectionist to a fault, especially in preparing for live shows. As I've evolved, I've learned what we consider the imperfections are actually what make us unique and what makes a one-of-a-kind live performance!'</p>

<p>In addition to taking the pop music scene by storm in the late 80s and early 90s – and becoming the youngest-ever female to write, produce and perform a No. 1 single with Foolish Beat – Debbie has also enjoyed a career as an actress on the Broadway musical stage. </p>

<p>'Follow them in music, in love and in health. Nobody knows what's best for you better than you!'</p>

<p>And lastly, Debbie mentioned the importance of truthfulness in life.</p>

<p>'Don't cheat at Pictionary,' she joked. 'You know you're a bad liar and will end up confessing and blowing it for the whole team!'</p>

<p>The performer then transitioned to Broadway in musicals like Beauty And The Beast as well as several television roles in the 90s and beyond.</p>
