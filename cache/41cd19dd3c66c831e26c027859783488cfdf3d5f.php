<p>As of Tuesday, people arriving from Delaware, Maryland, Ohio and West Virginia will now have to spend 14 days in quarantine before they are able to head outside. </p>

<p>States are added to the list if their number of positive tests exceeds 10 percent over, or the number of positive cases exceeds 10 per 100,000 over a seven day rolling average. </p>

<p>Gov. Andrew Cuomo has added four more states to New York's mandatory quarantine list, taking the total number to 34</p>

<p>New York instituted the mandatory quarantine alongside neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut back in late June. </p>

<p>After initially being hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic in March, April and May, residents in the tri-state area have managed to flatten the curve. </p>

<p>On Monday, just 519 New York state residents tested positive to the coronavirus, down from daily highs around 9,600 back in April. </p>

<p>However, officials are remaining vigilant amid fears of a second wave - particularly with colder weather right around the corner. </p>

<p>There is concern that returning residents or travelers from out of state could inadvertently spread the virus is the flout quarantine - with New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio revealing a new measure he hopes will help keep locals safe. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, he stated that sheriff's deputies will now board buses that arrive in Manhattan and order those from states on the quarantine list to fill out a form detailing their contact information and quarantine plans. </p>

<p>The form is already a requirement for travelers arriving at New York airports, and those who refuse to complete the paperwork face fines of $2,000. </p>

<p> Meanwhile, Cuomo on Tuesday said he would not reopen indoor dining in New York City despite the infection rate being less than one percent for weeks in a row. </p>

<p>He argued it would double the number of bars currently open and claimed there is no one to enforce social distancing standards.</p>

<p>The reasoning came after a conglomerate of bar and restaurant owners sued the state for $2billion in damages, claiming they were being unfairly shackled and stopped from making money.</p>

<p>New York City - which has more bars and restaurants than any other city in the US - remains the only metropolis in the world that is yet to resume indoor dining.</p>

<p> Returning residents and travelers must fill out an online health form and quarantine for 14 days  if they have arrived from any of the following states:</p>
