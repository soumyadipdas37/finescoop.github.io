<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother dubbed 'Karen from Brighton' has broken three weeks of silence to unleash another brutal attack on Daniel Andrews over Melbourne lockdown. </p>

<p>Jodi Grollo embraced her nickname after she attracted online fame for a television interview in which she justified travelling outside her suburb for her daily walks because she was bored of the streets in her affluent coastal suburb of Brighton.</p>

<p>She even set up Instagram account to poke fun at herself after becoming a minor celebrity, and to take potshots at the Victorian premier after he slammed her for whinging about lockdown. </p>

<p>After keeping quiet in recent weeks, 'Karen' resurfaced on Sunday night after the Premier unveiled his much-anticipated roadmap out of lockdown.</p>

<p>She uploaded a photo of herself leaning against the kitchen bench drinking red wine straight from the carafe, which was captioned with reworded lyrics to The Eagles' classic Hotel California.</p>

<p>The Real Karen from Briiighton (pictured on Sunday) is back with another stinging attack on Victorian Prmier Daniel Andrews</p>

<p>Described as an 'original Karen song', the opening chorus line of Welcome to Hotel California was replaced with 'Welcome to the Socialist State of Victoria.'</p>

<p>The rest of the chorus was littered with references to six weeks of stage four lockdowns in Melbourne, which were extended another two weeks until at least September 28 on Sunday.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 63 new cases and five more deaths on Sunday, which takes the state's toll to 666 and the national figure to 753.</p>

<p>'Now the pubs are shut &amp; the economy's f****d in Dantoria,' her chorus continues.</p>

<p>'There is no freedom dear. You won't find it here.</p>

<p>'For the rest of the year we won't be leaving here.</p>

<p>You can check out any time you like but you can never leeeeeeeeeeave.</p>

<p>'Welcome to the State of Dantoria.' </p>

<p>Karen from Brighton aka Jodi Grollo had been quiet in recent weeks up until Sunday night</p>

<p>Karen ended the post with a plea for fellow Victorians. </p>

<p>'Do what he says follows the rules and we will be out of this mess sooner rather than later and he will be out of a job*** #karenforpremier #dantoria.</p>

<p>Karen's post was inundated with messages of support.</p>

<p>'I miss you Karen - as much as Chairman Dan misses Beijing,' one person commneted.</p>

<p>Another added: 'Thanks Karen for giving us some humour as we go through this... when all this is over we need answers on the hotel quarantine f***up!'</p>

<p>Ms Grollo is the daughter of pokies king Bruce Mathieson, and the husband of Gianni Grollo, whose family controls the prominent Grollo construction empire.</p>

<p>Karen from Brighton reworded the lyrics to Hotel California in her latest Instagram post</p>

<p>She initially went viral when she said she had trudged through all of the streets of Brighton and therefore was ignoring instructions for people not to travel across town for exercise or any other outing.</p>

<p>'Well, you get sick of walking the same streets. You know, I've done all of Brighton,' she told Nine News while walking the city's Tan Track in July.</p>

<p>Previous posts on The Real Karen from Briiighton page included showing off her lockdown stash of booze, social distancing outside a cafe and punching boxing bags at her local gym with a swipe at Premier Andrews.</p>

<p>'I’ll dodge him faster then he dodges questions about hotel quarantine. I’ll lock him down like Victoria,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured) has come under more scruntiny after releasing his road map out of lockdown on Sunday</p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has previously slammed Melburnians who complained about the stay-at-home orders amid a second wave of COVID-19 infections. </p>

<p>Ms Grollo said she was not bothered by Mr Andrews' rebuke, or the hundreds of angry comments online, and hadn't seen them anyway. </p>

<p>'I'm not on social media so I didn't see any [of the backlash]. To be honest, I found it funny – it made my weekend,' she previously told The Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Victorians got a clearer idea of how long they'll be in lockdown for on Sunday when Premier Andrews released his road map. </p>

<p>From September 14, Melbourne's night curfew will start an hour later at 9pm and run until 5am.</p>

<p>The Real Karen from Briiighton has grown to more than 13,600 Instagram followers</p>

<p>People living alone will be able to nominate a friend or family member who can visit them, while two hours of daily exercise will be allowed, including 'social interactions' such as having a picnic at a local park or reading a book at the beach.</p>

<p>The curfew won't be lifted until October 26, with people able to leave their homes for non-essential reasons.</p>

<p>The lockdown will only lift on that date if the average number of new cases falls below five and there are fewer than five unknown source cases.</p>

<p>Up to five visitors from a nominated household and outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people will also be allowed.</p>

<p>Karen from Brighton became famous following her comments about lockdown in a television interview (pictured)</p>

<p> On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair</p>

<p>Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air</p>

<p>Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light</p>

<p>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim</p>

<p>I had to stop for the night</p>

<p>There he stood in the doorway;</p>

<p>I heard the mission bell</p>

<p>And I was thinking to myself,</p>

<p>'this used to be heaven now it is hell'</p>

<p>Then he lit up a candle and he showed me the way</p>

<p>There were voices down the corridor,</p>

<p>Then I heard them say...</p>

<p>Welcome to the Socialist State of Victoria</p>

<p>It was a lovely place</p>

<p>Such a lovely place</p>

<p>Now the pubs are shut &amp; the economy's fucked in Dantoria.</p>

<p>There is no freedom dear. You won't find it here</p>

<p>For the rest of the year we won't be leaving here</p>

<p>You can check out any time you like but you can never leeeeeeeeeeave</p>

<p>Welcome to the State of Dantoria.</p>
