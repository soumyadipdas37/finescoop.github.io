<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Minneapolis city officials are facing backlash for allowing a street to be named after George Floyd who died under the knee of a white police officer in May. </p>

<p>A stretch of a street in the city that includes the place where Floyd was killed will soon be named in his honor.</p>

<p>Although the street will still be called Chicago Avenue, the city will refer to the blocks between 37th and 39th streets as George Perry Floyd Jr Place. </p>

<p>The City Council approved the naming Friday, and Mayor Jacob Frey's office said he would likely sign off on it as well.</p>

<p>Following the announcement, several people took to social media to criticize the move.  </p>

<p>Minneapolis city officials are facing backlash for allowing a street to be named after George Floyd who died under the knee of a white police officer in May</p>

<p>Following the announcement, several people took to social media to criticize the move</p>

<p>'I don't think anyone disputes that the officers are wrong and rightfully being charged for George Floyd's death. But now we are naming a street in memory of a criminal? What a joke,' one Twitter user shared. </p>

<p>Another user wrote: 'When George Floyd, Breanna [sic] Taylor, Atatiana Jefferson, Aura Rosser, Philando Castille, etc were murdered, libs wanted to set guidelines on how to protest and asked to change street names. </p>

<p>'When RBG dies of cancer though, libs want to tear everything down. See the problem?' </p>

<p>A third person said: 'It won't be long before someone is killed there, and it won't be by the police.'  </p>

<p>In a tweet, another person made the point that black people want justice instead of having street names changed. </p>

<p>'Americans be renaming streets like: "George Floyd Jr street" I am sure black folk don't want street names changed. They want justice and change,' the user tweeted.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there were others who didn't have a problem with the street being renamed after Floyd</p>

<p>Benjamin Crump, who is representing the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, shared: 'We will continue to make change in our communities in your honor, brother'</p>

<p>A group of demonstrators occupied the area, saying they will not leave until the city meets their demands, including funding for anti-racism training and a temporary property tax freeze for people within that zone</p>

<p>'Conservatives are triggered bc a street will be named after George Floyd but they're perfectly fine with schools being named after slave owners. Make it make sense, y'all,' one person said on Twitter. </p>

<p>Benjamin Crump, who is representing the families of Ahmaud Arbery, Floyd, and Breonna Taylor, shared: '3 blocks of the Minneapolis street where #GeorgeFloyd took his last breath will be renamed "George Perry Floyd Jr. Place" in his memory. </p>

<p>'We will continue to make change in our communities in your honor, brother.' </p>

<p>Floyd died on May 25 after Derek Chauvin, a white officer, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck even as Floyd said he couldn't breathe. </p>

<p>His death was captured in widely seen bystander video that set off protests around the world.</p>

<p>Months after Floyd's death, the intersection remains barricaded and now holds a memorial. </p>

<p>A group of demonstrators has occupied the area, saying they will not leave until the city meets their demands, including funding for anti-racism training and a temporary property tax freeze for people within that zone.</p>

<p>The city had announced plans to reopen 38th Street this summer but backed off, avoiding a confrontation.</p>

<p>The city continues to work on a long-term plan for the intersection.</p>
