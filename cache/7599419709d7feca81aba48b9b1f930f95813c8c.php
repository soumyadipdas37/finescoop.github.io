<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He had countless beachside mansions, a brand new Porsche and one of the nation's most famous pubs in his name. </p>

<p>But multi-millionaire Maxwell James Twigg now has to hand some of his prized assets over to his mother and sisters after a judge ordered an end to their bitter family feud.</p>

<p>The incredible court battle giving an insight into the lives of the uber rich reached a conclusion on Monday, as NSW Supreme Court Justice Michael Ball ruled Max made $100 million in unauthorised transfers from the family trust into his own pocket.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old now has to give his mum Diane, and sisters Frances and Elizabeth, a share of his wealth.</p>

<p>Max took over the family landfill business in 1996 after the death of his father, with it growing drastically before being sold to cleaning goliath Cleanaway for $155 million in 2007.</p>

<p>After that sale he gave his mum Diane, and sisters Elizabeth and Frances, a 'gift' - in the form of $5 million in cash.</p>

<p>He claimed the rest and bought a Gold Coast mansion for $16 million, the Byron Bay Beach Hotel - founded by Paul Hogan's sidekick John 'Strop' Cornell - for $40 million, and lived what a judge described as an 'extravagant lifestyle'.</p>

<p>But now he will have to divide between his relatives four of his Gold Coast mansions, a nearby industrial site, a brand new $650,000 Porsche sports car and $9 million in cash.</p>

<p>Maxwell James Twigg (pictured) has been ordered to share his enormous wealth with his mum and two sisters after 'dishonestly' pocketing more than $100 million from the family trust fund</p>

<p>Twigg's sisters Elizabeth (left) and Frances (right, with her husband) received a $5 million 'gift' following the sale of the family's business to cleaning giant Cleanaway in 2007 for $155 million </p>

<p>The majority of what was left over was used by Max to fund his extravagant lifestyle, including buying the Byron Bay Beach Hotel (pictured) founded by Paul Hogan's sidekick John 'Strop' Cornell </p>

<p>The court heard that after the death of his father William to cancer in 1996, Max took over management of the Twigg Group businesses as his dad had hoped.</p>

<p>After more than a decade of successful growth since taking over the company, both Max and his mum - his co-director - agreed to sell the business to Cleanaway in 2007 for $155.8 million.</p>

<p>The deal saw $113.8 million paid in cash to one of the Twiggs' business arms, plus an extra $40 million in shares.</p>

<p>Controlling most of this money in his role as a director and the only hands-on member of his family, Mr Twigg paid $5 million 'gifts' to his mum and sisters.</p>

<p>The remainder of the sale proceeds - $105.5 million - he pocketed himself.</p>

<p>But when the Global Financial Crisis hit in 2008 it caused major damage to the share portfolios of the family.</p>

<p>Max had reaped in $32 million shares as a result of the deal with Cleanaway, but by the time he sold them in 2009 he did so for $3.4 million - a loss of $28.5 million.</p>

<p>Similarly, Mrs Twigg and her two daughters had invested much of the $5 million 'gift' they got in the stock market through a broker, but still they lost almost all of it.</p>

<p>As a result of what they alleged was mismanagement by their investor Mrs Twigg and her two daughters took legal action in early 2013.</p>

<p>This was when their brother's secret actions began unravel.   </p>

<p>Diane Twigg (pictured with her grandsons) was also given a $5 million 'gift' from the company that her husband William started</p>

<p>Max (pictured with his partner Amanda) experienced his own losses from the GFC, with almost $32 million in shares he received from the Cleanaway deal worth just $3.4 million by 2009</p>

<p>This beachside mansion on the Gold Coast cost $16 million and is one of several owned by Max</p>

<p>While he will be allowed to keep this Mermaid Beach home, he will have to give up four others to his mum and sisters </p>

<p>Among the prized possessions he will have to give up is a $650,000 Porsche 911 Coupe (similar to the one pictured), with the number plate 'TURN ONE'</p>

<p>Left with a tax bill from the $900,000 settlement they reached with their stock broker they sought help from the family well.</p>

<p>After discovering the family trust had been bled dry they began a hunt for the funds which led to them to their brother's 'extravagant lifestyle'. </p>

<p>But in the years prior to launching legal action against their sibling they continued to be a happy family.</p>

<p>In 2010, Max purchased a sprawling mega mansion at Harkaway for $4.41 million.</p>

<p>It featured a helipad, an enormous outdoor pool, car show room and even a go kart track.</p>

<p>It was so big that Mrs Twigg sold the family home at Lysterfield and moved to a unit at the back of her son's property.</p>

<p>So wealthy was her son that in 2013, Mrs Twigg moved to take him out of the will so as to leave any remaining wealth to her daughters and their families.</p>

<p>His wealth expanded further when he sold the Byron Bay Beach Hotel in 2017 for $70 million. </p>

<p>Finally, the court has ordered him to share a decent slice with his relatives.</p>

<p>Max (pictured with his son Will) will have to divide between his relatives four of his Gold Coast mansions, a nearby industrial site, a brand new $650,000 Porsche sports car and $9 million in cash</p>

<p>Max purchased a sprawling mega mansion at Harkaway, in Melbourne's south-east, in 2011 for $4.41 million. It had a helipad, enormous outdoor pool, car show room and even a go kart track and was sold for $9 million earlier this year (He is pictured on the go kart track with his sons)</p>

<p>In ordering the multi-millionaire race car driver to hand over some of his assets to his mum and sisters, Justice Ball simply described Max as 'dishonest'.</p>

<p>'Equitable compensation in respect of Max's breach of fiduciary duties,' he said.</p>

<p>'The payment of those sums absent any resolution or other authority given to Max to make the payments involved a breach of duty by him or the intermeddling by him in the affairs of the relevant trusts.'</p>

<p>While he will have to give up several of his mansions and his Porsche with the licence plate 'TURN ONE', he will get to keep a large number of his lavish assets as the court could not determine they had been bought with family funds.</p>

<p>These include a Dodge RAM worth more than $200,000, a $200,000 MTRV caravan, a Hyundai Excel racing model sedan and a Holden Monaro which is being restored.  </p>

<p>He will also get to keep two mansions at Mermaid Beach - including one worth $16 million - and the diminished proceeds of his shares from the Cleanaway deal.  </p>
