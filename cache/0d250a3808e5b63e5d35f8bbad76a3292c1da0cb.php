<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The future of the high street is 'hanging in the balance' after a huge number of job losses and store closures as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a union leader has warned.</p>

<p>Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers' union Usdaw, said 125,000 retail jobs have been lost this year.</p>

<p>He added 14,000 shops have closed.</p>

<p>'We are facing a massive crisis, shops are struggling to survive and the future of the high street hanging in the balance,' he told the annual TUC Congress.</p>

<p>'The Government has to intervene. Do we want to see high streets go to the wall or do we want to save millions of jobs?</p>

<p>'We desperately need a recovery plan to get the industry back on its feet.'</p>

<p>The future of the high street is 'hanging in the balance' after a huge number of job losses and store closures as a result of the coronavirus crisis, a union leader has warned (pictured: general view of boarded up shops on Margate High Street, Kent)</p>

<p>Mr Lillis said high streets were in decline before the pandemic, hit by vacant properties and job losses.</p>

<p>Usdaw is calling for an urgent recovery plan to include reform of business rates, a review of rental values and lease arrangements, and a new deal for retail, distribution and home delivery workers based around a real living wage and guaranteed hours.</p>

<p>Fears over a wave of coronavirus redundancies were fueled today as figures showed another fall in payroll jobs and a spike in unemployment.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate rose from 3.9 per cent to 4.1 per cent in the quarter to July - the first time it has increased since the pandemic hit, and the highest in two years. A total of 1.4million are out of work, up by 62,000.</p>

<p>Cafe chain Costa has said 1,650 staff are at risk of redundancy as it looks to cut costs amid continued uncertainty over when trade will fully recover following the pandemic</p>

<p>Coffee and sandwich chain Pret a Manger confirmed it has axed 2,800 roles from its shops</p>

<p>The estimated increase in the rate for July alone was even higher at 0.5 per cent, according to the latest official data.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, some 695,000 payroll jobs have gone since March, and there are 2.7million people claiming benefits.</p>

<p>Economists warned that the fall is the tip of the iceberg as it covers a period when the government's massive furlough scheme is in effect - with alarming predictions of mass layoffs to come when it is withdrawn completely next month. </p>

<p>According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the number of people on payrolls was down 36,000 in August from July. It is now 695,000 lower than in March. </p>

<p>It comes after coalition of retailers warned the Treasury that 10,000 jobs could be wiped out 'overnight' unless urgent action is taken to avert a deepening crisis.</p>

<p>Shops are still recovering from three months of store closures with trade remaining significantly down on last year as shoppers and office workers avoid town centres.</p>

<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak handed high street firms a £10 billion business rates holiday in March. </p>

<p>But he has been told by about 25 chains that reinstating business rates in April would force them to close 800 shops, triggering the jobs cull. The total is likely to soar once other retailers add their projections.</p>

<p>Bosses say a decision on any aid package must come soon or firms will assume the worst and close stores and cancel stock orders.</p>

<p>It comes as economists warn that jobless figures could soar above three million this winter, eclipsing record highs in the early 1980s.</p>

<p>The announcement that household gatherings will be capped at six has raised fears that Christmas celebrations will be limited – further dampening trade in what many retailers call the 'golden quarter'.</p>

<p>This month it was revealed Debenhams was set to axe 2,500 jobs across its stores and warehouses</p>

<p>Some groups, such as New Look, have called in restructuring teams. The 450-store fashion retailer's future is hanging in the balance. Stores including Boots and Debenhams are said to have 'bombarded' the Treasury with warnings.</p>

<p>'Things have turned pretty ugly,' said one chairman. 'It's difficult to see how anyone can invest in this environment. It's chaos. Anything that provides some certainty would help – but it needs to be done fast.' </p>

<p>Cafe chain Costa has said 1,650 staff are at risk of redundancy as it looks to cut costs amid continued uncertainty over when trade will fully recover following the pandemic.</p>

<p>It told staff last Thursday that it has started consultations which could impact more than a 10th of roles.</p>

<p>The move came a week after rival Pret A Manger revealed it was slashing 2,800 roles as part of a restructure of its UK business.</p>

<p>The High Street has been decimated amid the pandemic, with the likes of Debenhams, WH Smith and Pizza Express also announcing job cuts. </p>

<p>Costa has become the latest employer to warn that large numbers of jobs are at risk. </p>

<p>Last week, the Co-operative Bank said it plans to cut around 350 jobs.</p>

<p>It follows cuts of around 7,000 roles announced by retail giant M&amp;S last week, with mass redundancies also on the horizon at the likes of John Lewis, sushi chain Yo! and clothing store River Island. </p>

<p>And around 14,000 jobs could be on the brink at struggling department store Debenhams, with plans to liquidate the business being drawn up in case other options for saving the company – such as selling it – fall through. </p>

<p>Here are the major potential job losses announced since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed on March 23:</p>
