<p>Rose told News.com.au this week that she decided to trim her brunette locks after she contracted dengue fever while living in Vanuatu with her family.</p>

<p>'When I was living in Vanuatu, I unfortunately contracted dengue fever, which is something that is similar to malaria. It's a mosquito-born virus that's really common in tropical environments,' she began.</p>

<p>She's back! The acclaimed journalist recently returned to media with the launch of her new financial podcast, Clever Money</p>

<p>'The reason I cut my hair initially was that I actually had a health situation which most people don't know about,' the mother-of-two explained.</p>

<p>Rose explained it was much easier to maintain shorter locks and feel comfortable amid Vanuatu's soaring temperatures.</p>

<p>'I was extremely unwell for a period of time,' she said.</p>

<p>The former Channel 10 star relocated from Sydney to Vanuatu in 2017 with her then-husband Steve, in a 'last-ditch' attempt to work on their marriage. The couple eventually split in 2018.</p>
