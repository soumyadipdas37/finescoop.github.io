<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Italian Grand Prix is supposed to be the showpiece event for Ferrari but it looks set to be the Lewis Hamilton show with the championship leader looking unstoppable in his Mercedes.Â Â </p>

<p>The six-time world champion put in a qualifying clinic on Saturday, clocking the fastest lap time in Formula One history to snatch pole away from team-mate Valtteri Bottas, and it is hard to look past him making it count over 53 laps at Monza.</p>

<p>Carlos Sainz may be the best hope of breaking up the Mercedes one-two, with the McLaren driver performing superbly in qualifying to put his car third for today's race. Charles Leclerc and Sebastien Vettel, meanwhile, begin outside the points with Ferrari.Â </p>

<p>Follow all the action and the drama as it unfolds on track and on the pit-wall right here with Sportsmail's OLLIE LEWIS. The race begins at 2.10pm BST.</p>

<p>Today's race will be the last in which a Williams family member is in charge of the team, marking the end of the family's long presence in the sport.Â </p>

<p>Sir Frank Williams founded the team in 1977 and transformed it into one of the most successful teams in F1, winning nine constructors' championships and seven drivers' championships.Â </p>

<p>The other big story emerging today involves Renault, who will be re-branded next season as Alpine.</p>

<p>The team will take on the new name and also have a new team colour scheme with the yellow and black being scrapped for a red, white and blue set-up synonymous with the French flag.</p>

<p>It will be a case of damage limitation for Ferrari today, as The Prancing Horse looking for a respectable result with a car that is just not showing any pace this season. Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel will begin the race outside the points.</p>
