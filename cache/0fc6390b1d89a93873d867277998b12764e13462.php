<p>Zac began dating model and entrepreneur Sami Miró in September 2014, but the pair called it quits in April 2016.   </p>

<p>The Disaster Artist actor has previously spoken about his struggles when it comes to finding love.  </p>

<p>Speaking to the UK Times in 2016, Zac said: 'Dating is something I’ll never be able to do. As in the dictionary definition of dating, because one way or another, I’ve impacted that person’s life and they’ll soon realise it' </p>

<p>'A date has to be very long to dispel whatever people think about me,' he added.  </p>

<p>It comes after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles last month. </p>

<p>'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'</p>

<p>Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Zac is rumoured to have recently 'inspected and put in an offer' on a home in Byron Bay, according to The Daily Telegraph. </p>
