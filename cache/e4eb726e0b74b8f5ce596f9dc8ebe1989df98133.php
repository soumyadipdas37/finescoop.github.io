<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal legend Ian Wright has insisted that it is imperative that the Gunners tie Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to a new contract.</p>

<p>Aubameyang is into the last year of his contract, and, despite widespread reports that he is on the verge of committing his future to the club, the forward has yet to put pen to paper on a new deal.</p>

<p>The prolific 31-year-old was on the scoresheet again on Saturday as Arsenal commenced their new Premier League campaign with a 3-0 victory away to Fulham.</p>

<p>Ian Wright has stressed that it is vital for Arsenal to keep captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang</p>

<p>Arsenal legend Wright joked that he will take a contract to Aubameyang to sign if he has toÂ </p>

<p>Ian Wright says Arsenal HAVE TO sign Aubameyang... even if it means taking the contract to him in person ðŸ˜…#MOTD on <?php echo e('@'); ?>BBCOne ðŸ‘‰ https://t.co/IQvwYDcJBg#Arsenal #bbcfootball pic.twitter.com/YbdA1cNaK2</p>

<p>Wright is concerned about the situation and joked that he will take a contract to Aubameyang himself if necessary.</p>

<p>He was asked about the matter on BBC's Match of the Day, with presenter Gary Lineker saying: 'Arsenal have brought in a few additions but perhaps Aubameyang will be their best signing.'</p>

<p>Wright responded: 'He will be their best signing. Iâ€™m going to go and see papa Aubameyang tomorrow. They have to sign him. Itâ€™s as simple as that.'</p>

<p>Alan Shearer then asked him: 'Will you take him the contract yourself?'.</p>

<p>Wright then said: 'If I have to! We have to sign that guy.'</p>

<p>Lineker then added: 'I think itâ€™s going to happen, relax!'.</p>

<p>Aubameyang was on the scoresheet as Arsenal started the season with a win versus Fulham</p>

<p>Aubameyang, who has often been deployed on the left flank by Mikel Arteta, played a crucial part in Arsenal's FA Cup success last season, scoring a brace in the semi-final victory against Manchester City prior to repeating the feat in the final against Chelsea.</p>

<p>Since joining Arsenal in January 2018 Aubameyang has scored 72 goals in 111 appearances.</p>

<p>Arsenal have brought in winger Willian and centre-back Gabriel Magalhaes in this transfer window, while Dani Ceballos has re-joined on loan from Real Madrid.</p>

<p>There could be further arrivals, and Arteta's side would benefit from at least one extra midfielder, but securing Aubameyang's future is also key.Â Â </p>
