<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor suffered a major editing fail during Wednesday's episode, with hopeful Roxi Kenny inexplicably seen in two different outfits during the same scene.</p>

<p>About 30 minutes into the episode, Locky Gilbert arrived at the Bachelor mansion on a motorcycle, informing the excitable group of girls that he'd be taking one of them out on a date.</p>

<p>'Roxi, I would love for you to come on a ride with me,' the 29-year-old told the squealing group of girls. </p>

<p>Oops: The Bachelor suffered a major editing fail during Wednesday's episode, with hopeful Roxi Kenny inexplicably seen in two different outfits during the same scene. Pictured in denim shorts (left) and again on the back of Locky Gilbert's motorcycle in jeans (right)</p>

<p>When she first stepped outside the house, Roxi emerged in a pair of denim cut-offs, which she'd teamed with black sneakers and a long-sleeve black T-shirt.</p>

<p>But as she clamoured onto the motorcycle behind Locky, Roxi was suddenly dressed in jeans and a black leather jacket.</p>

<p>Viral Instagram meme page Bachelor Funny noticed the gaffe, pointing it out in a post on Thursday. </p>

<p>Keeping it short: When she first stepped outside the house, Roxi (pictured with Locky Gilbert) emerged in a pair of denim cut-offs, which she'd teamed with black sneakers and a long-sleeve black T-shirt </p>

<p>'Anyone else notice Roxi's shorts magically turn into jeans in a split second last night? Edit failzzz,' they captioned a comparison picture.</p>

<p>And plenty of fans had also picked up on the error, commenting on the post.</p>

<p>'OMGGG thank you, I thought I was going crazy,' wrote one person, while another added, 'Yep, and she suddenly had a leather jacket'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, others said they hadn't noticed, and were too caught up in the drama of the episode.</p>

<p>'No I didn't even notice,' commented one fan, while another wrote, 'Lol omg I didn't pick it'.</p>

<p>One likely explanation for it is that Roxi wasn't dressed appropriately for the surprise date and needed to go inside to quickly change.  </p>
