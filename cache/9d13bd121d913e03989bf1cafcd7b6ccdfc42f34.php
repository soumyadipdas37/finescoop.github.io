<p>Their solid relationship has gone the distance after they first got together and are one of the rare Love Island romances that have not fizzled out. </p>

<p>The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance. </p>

<p>Milestone: The couple pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London earlier in the week</p>

<p>When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.</p>

<p>'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.</p>

<p>'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.</p>

<p>'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.' </p>

<p>Impressive: Their solid relationship has gone the distance after they first got together in 2016, and are one of the rare Love Island romances that have not fizzled out (pictured on the show)</p>
