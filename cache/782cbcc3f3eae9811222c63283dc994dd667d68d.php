<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A digital reconstruction of a 15th-century monk's face have shown he faintly resembled an elderly Wayne Rooney.   </p>

<p>The image of the medieval Benedictine abbot has been digitally constructed from a well-preserved skull.</p>

<p>Drawing on biographical details as well as the remains of Abbot John of Wheathampstead, experts put together the image with CT scans, The Guardian reported. </p>

<p>The remains were unearthed in December 2017 during excavations at St Albans Cathedral, Hertfordshire. </p>

<p>While some have said the digital reconstruction resembles Wayne Rooney, another has said Mikhail Gorbachev, or the former Labour home secretary John Reid. </p>

<p>Experts used a well-preserved skull, unearthed at St Albans Abbey in 2017, and biographical information to put together a digital reconstruction of Abbot John of Wheathampstead</p>

<p>One of those supervising the work, Professor James Clark from Exeter University, said it was the 'first accurate representation' of a monastic figure before 1500 in England, according to the BBC. </p>

<p>The excavation in 2017 took place with the aim of discovering as much as possible before a Welcome Centre for visitors was built, so that any findings weren't damaged or disturbed. </p>

<p>In January 2017, they uncovered a 15-century skeleton which was identified as that of Abbot John of Wheathampstead, who died in 1465. </p>

<p>Experts were able to identify the body because of three papal bulls issued by Pope Martin V which were found accompanying the skeleton. </p>

<p>Scientific foundations and artistic visualisation were done by the team at the Face Lab, based at Liverpool John Moore University. </p>

<p>Biogrpahical information was provided from the documentary sources by Professor James Clark at Exeter University. </p>

<p>Some have said the reconstruction faintly resembles Wayne Rooney but Professor Caroline Wilkinson said, while the ears resemble Rooney, the face proportions are similar to Mikhail Gorbachev</p>

<p>In a post on the St Albans Cathedral website, Professor Clark wrote: 'It is a genial face, suggesting a gentle, even a warm and engaging character; and faintly familiar: this could be the friend or neighbour of many years’ standing, perhaps the stalwart member of the parish congregation. </p>

<p>'Like any of those, it is a face that speaks of life experience; of the passage of time; of service given.' </p>

<p>He added: 'The facial reconstruction of the abbot equally enhances our view of medieval England. </p>

<p>'His is only the second face from the fifteenth century to be seen, nearly ten years after Richard III was revealed before the nation’s eyes. </p>

<p>'Abbot Wheathampstead is also only the second churchman of medieval England to be the subject of research of this kind.' </p>

<p>Director of Face Lab based at Liverpool John Moores University Professor Caroline Wilkinson, who led the project, said she doesn't think the reconstruction looks like anyone in particular. </p>

<p>She said the only similarity between the reconstruction and Rooney are the ears, while similar proportions in the face could make it resemble Gorbachev.  </p>

<p>Abbot John was known for his florid complexion, according to Professor Clark, unkindly described as 'girlish blushing'. </p>

<p>He suffered with chronic health conditions from his fifties, which was reportedly in his spleen, kidneys, liver and stomach and he only walked with a walking stick.  </p>
