<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An axeman has been jailed for four years after inflicting the 'worst example of grievous bodily harm' a veteran judge had ever seen following a row with his drinking partner.  </p>

<p>Leon Green had been at a pub in Chard, Somerset, with victim Joseph Guppy before going back to the other man's home.</p>

<p>It was then that the 34-year-old lost his temper and launched the vicious axe attack which left the victim with multiple wounds and a small fracture of the skull.</p>

<p>Green denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court in July.</p>

<p>He has since been jailed for four years and ten months with a one-year extended licence, by Judge Linford, who was sitting at Exeter Crown Court. </p>

<p>The sentence was the maximum allowed. </p>

<p>Leon Green (pictured) has been jailed for four years after inflicting the 'worst example of grievous bodily harm' a veteran judge had ever seen following a row with his drinking partner</p>

<p>Judge Robert Linford declared that Green is a danger to the public and said the attack on Mr Guppy could easily have killed the victim.</p>

<p>He said some of the photographs of the wounds had even been too intense to shown the jury at the original trial at Taunton Crown Court.</p>

<p>Green has a long record of violence and dishonesty, including a burglary at the Yeovil Labour Club last year where he caused thousands of pounds of damage trying to break into the bar. </p>

<p>He carried out the axe attack when he was part way through a 'thinking skills course' which he was sent on for stabbing a man with a screwdriver. </p>

<p>The judge told Green: 'You went back to Mr Guppy's house where he was clowning around and dancing around and at some point his hand went close to your face. It was not an aggressive mood.</p>

<p>'It set off the most extreme reaction. You picked up an axe and struck him repeatedly about the head and body and caused multiple wounds and a small fracture of the skull.</p>

<p>'It is astonishing the injuries were not more serious than they were. You could have killed him. This is the worst example of grievous bodily harm I have ever encountered.</p>

<p>'The probation report came to the conclusion that because of your record of violence and the facts of this case, you are a dangerous offender. I am in no doubt whatsoever about it.'</p>

<p>Green denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court (pictured) in July</p>

<p>Miss Virginia Cornwall, prosecuting, said the attack on Mr Guppy happened at his home in High Street, Chard, on the night of October 10 last year after he and Green had been drinking in a nearby pub.</p>

<p>The burglary at the Labour Club in Yeovil took place on July 27, 2019 and police were called by a neighbour who heard banging noises from inside in the middle of the night.    </p>

<p>Green and another man were arrested and the club had to be closed temporarily to repair doors and shutters which had been smashed.</p>

<p>Mr Patrick Mason, defending, said all Green's offending arose from a disrupted childhood in which he stopped going to school when he was 13 or 14 and fell into the company of criminals.</p>

<p>He said the axe attack had been excessive self defence and the raid on the Labour Club happened at a time when Green was homeless and desperate.</p>

<p>Green, of Perrythorne Park, Yeovil, denied causing grievous bodily harm but was found guilty at Taunton Crown Court in July. He also admitted burglary.</p>

<p>He was jailed for four years and ten months with a one year extended licence, by Judge Linford, who was sitting at Exeter Crown Court. The sentence was the maximum allowed. </p>

<p>Police praised the courage of the victim and welcomed the sentence.</p>

<p>PC Jim Card said: 'This was an extremely unpleasant incident in which Leon Green used an axe to assault another man at a property in High Street, Chard. </p>

<p>'His actions were dangerous and could have easily resulted in far more serious consequences.</p>

<p>'I'd like to thank the victim and the witness for supporting our investigation and I welcome the custodial sentence given to Green in court today.'</p>
