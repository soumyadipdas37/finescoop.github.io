<p>They shared the picture to mark today’s 75th anniversary of of Victory in Japan day writing: 'Did you know that The Duke of Edinburgh was on active service in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered on VJ Day? </p>

<p>'His Royal Highness joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939. </p>

<p>Royal Family have released this black and white picture of Prince Philip in 1945 who was aboard HMS Whelp when the Japanese surrendered in Tokyo Bay</p>

<p>'Following active service during the Second World War in HMS RAMILLIES, HMS VALIANT and HMS WALLACE, he served in HMS WHELP as First Lieutenant. </p>

<p>'On VJ Day, the Ship’s Crew in HMS WHELP helped to recover Prisoners of War.'      </p>

<p>The Duke of Edinburgh recalled his experiences of the historic day in Tokyo Bay in a BBC interview recorded in 1995.   </p>

<p>'I suppose I spent longer in [HMP] Whelp than in any other ship and I was first and second in command from beginning to end,' he said. </p>

<p>'And it took me all the way from Scapa Flow to Tokyo and back again. </p>

<p>'Being in Tokyo Bay with the surrender ceremony taking place in a battleship, which was 200 yards away. You could see what was going on with a pair of binoculars,' recalled the Duke in a 1995 interview</p>

<p>'It was a great relief. I remember from there we went on to Hong Kong and [had] the most extraordinary sensation when we sailed. </p>

<p>'We suddenly realised we didn't have to darken ship anymore, we didn't have to close all the scuttles, we didn't have to turn all the lights out.</p>

<p>'All these little things built up to suddenly feeling that life was different.'</p>

<p>The HMS WHELP took onboard a number of emaciated Prisoners of War that had been held by the Japanese.</p>

<p>The Duke described the emotional moment they collected the released PoWs.</p>

<p>'These people were naval people. They were emaciated and they sat down in the mess [hall],' he said.</p>

<p>'They were suddenly in an atmosphere which they recognised.  </p>

<p>'And our ships company also recognised that they were fellow sailors as they gave them a cup of tea.</p>

<p>'It was an extraordinary sensation because they just sat there, both sides, our own and them, I mean just tears pouring down their cheeks.</p>

<p>'They just drank their tea, they really couldn't speak. </p>

<p>The Duke of Edinburgh features in the DCMS ‘Then and Now’ project, which recognises a small sample of individuals who served and supported the war effort until the victory over Japan. </p>

<p>Images appeared on big screens across the country to mark today’s 75th anniversary of VJ Day.</p>
