<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham are in discussions with midfielder Jack Wilshere to cancel his contract by mutual consent.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has ten months left to run on his contract and the club are looking to cut that short as they look to funnel any spare funds into transfers.</p>

<p>West Ham saw a restructured offer of up to £28million for Burnley's James Tarkowski rejected on Thursday and are contemplating whether to go back again or move on to other options.</p>

<p>West Ham are in discussions with Jack Wilshere to cancel his contract by mutual consent</p>

<p>The lack of funds has been sorely felt by David Moyes as he strives to strengthen his squad and he hopes any extra cash found can be utilised on signings.</p>

<p>Wilshere joined the club in 2018 as a free agent on a three year contract worth around £100,000 a week. In an injury-plagued spell he has made just 18 appearances and scored one goal.</p>

<p>The former Arsenal star admitted earlier this year that his time at West Ham has not worked out.</p>

<p>Talking to Stadium Astro, he said: 'It hasn't worked out for me, I'll be honest. It hasn't gone the way I wanted it to, I've missed too much football, I haven't played enough games.</p>

<p>Manager David Moyes (left) is desperate to raise extra funds to use in the transfer market</p>

<p>'I want to get back on track, get my career back on track, get playing games week-in, week-out and start to feel like a footballer again.'</p>

<p>West Ham had hoped to sell the former England international but with no offers forthcoming they are now prepared to reach a compromise agreement with Wilshere to set him free.</p>

<p>They have struggled to offload a number of fringe players this summer resulting Grady Diangana's controversial sale to West Brom.</p>

<p>Moyes particularly wants to add a centre-back and full-back before the window closes.</p>
