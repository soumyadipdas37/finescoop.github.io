<p>But when the realisation dawned that it could go on for more than a year, levels of anxiety and loneliness remained high, according to data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). </p>

<p>When asked about their predictions when the UK first went into lockdown, more than 50 per cent made the optomistic forecast it would be over before the end of 2020. </p>

<p>Feelings of anxiety,  though having fallen since April, still  remain above pre-Covid levels (Left hand graph). But the graph on the right shows happiness has returned</p>

<p>Figures showed that by late August, when people began to return to work, more than a third of those surveyed said they thought the pandemic would last more than a year</p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the nationwide lockdown on March 23, with people told to stay at home, social events cancelled and all non-essential shops closed.</p>

<p>On April 1, 52% of people surveyed said they thought life would be back to normal in less than six months compared to nearly 11% who said it would be more than a year, the ONS said.</p>

<p>But by August 28, the proportion who felt it would be less than six months had fallen to 14%, while 37% said it would be more than 12 months, it added.</p>

<p>Levels of anxiety and happiness saw the greatest change when lockdown was introduced, compared with pre-pandemic levels, the ONS said.</p>

<p>One respondent in April reported: 'Am unable to do any of the things which normally fill my life and keep loneliness at bay, ie visiting friends, shopping, visiting places of interest, seeing children.'</p>

<p>As lockdown eased and social activity picked up, loneliness increased, the ONS said. A fifth of adults reported feeling lonely in mid-June suggesting their feelings may have intensified because many others were going out and socialising again</p>

<p>The data, published on Wednesday, comes from the ONS' Opinions and Lifestyle Survey</p>

<p>Fear and anxiety levels have remained stubbornly high since April, the figures show</p>

<p>As lockdown measures eased over the summer, and social activity picked up, loneliness also increased, the ONS said.</p>

<p>A fifth of adults reported feeling lonely in mid-June, it said, suggesting their feelings may have intensified because many others were going out and socialising again.</p>

<p>Others were fearful to leave their home, with one respondent saying they even wore a face mask to put the bins out.</p>

<p>One respondent in June said: 'I still don't feel safe when I go outside, not everyone keeps their distance.'</p>

<p>The survey also found that at the end of July, 82% of adults said they 'strongly support' or 'tend to support' the mandatory wearing of face coverings</p>

<p>Only half of adults said they felt confident in their abilities to homeschool their children and many reported concerns about them returning to school in September</p>

<p>Another added: 'I felt nervous when going into an enclosed space such as the garden centre.</p>

<p>'I have lost a bit of self-confidence about being near other people in case they don't respect social distancing.'</p>

<p>The data, published on Wednesday, comes from the weekly Opinions and Lifestyle Survey.</p>

<p>The survey also found that between May 7 and June 7, nearly nine-in-10 (87%) parents said a child in their household had been homeschooled because of coronavirus.</p>

<p>But only half of adults said they felt confident in their abilities to homeschool their children, 43% said homeschooling was negatively affecting their child's well-being, and 36% said homeschooling was putting a strain on their relationships.</p>

<p>The ONS found that at the end of May, 39% of parents reported that their children were struggling to continue their education at home but this rose to 60% by mid-June.</p>

<p>The most common reasons given were a lack of motivation and a lack of parents' time to provide support, the ONS added.</p>

<p>But parents were also concerned about sending their children back to school, with 58% saying they were either 'very' or 'somewhat worried' about children going back for the autumn term.</p>

<p>The survey also found that at the end of July, 82% of adults said they 'strongly support' or 'tend to support' the mandatory wearing of face coverings and by late August 57% had travelled to work 'at least sometimes' compared to 36% in late May.</p>
