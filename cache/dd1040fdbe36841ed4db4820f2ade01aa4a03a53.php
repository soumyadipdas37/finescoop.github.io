<p>New South Wales has already seen snakes spotted through the state, after the reptiles were encouraged out of their winter brumation due to a warm start to spring.</p>

<p>Brandon Gifford, a reptile keeper from the Australian Reptile Park, said there was no better time than now to brush up on snake-related first aid.</p>

<p>'We are putting out an urgent warning to all Australians that the weather is warming up and the snakes are on the move,' Mr Gifford said.</p>

<p>'They're breeding, they're feeding and they're ready to go.' </p>

<p>Australians have been warned to watch out for snakes as the weather warms up and snake season kicks in</p>

<p>Brandon Gifford, a reptile keeper from the Australian Reptile Park, said there was no better time than now to brush up on snake-related first aid</p>

<p>He said there were 3,000 snake bites in Australia every year, with only 300 people needing anti-venom.</p>

<p>One or two bites every year are fatal.  </p>

<p>'It's important that all Australians know our slithery friends do not go out of their way to harm humans,' Mr Gifford said.</p>

<p>'Snake bites mostly occur when people are trying to catch or kill the snake, so if you don't do either of those things you drastically reduce your chances of having a negative encounter with one of Australia's venomous snakes.'</p>

<p>Most people are bitten by snakes when deliberately trying to catch them and by not doing this, it drastically reduces the risk. </p>

<p>Mr Gifford said people should make their backyards as unappealing as possible to snakes.</p>

<p>This can be done by keeping the lawns mowed and not leaving items such as piles of timber and household refuse around. </p>

<p>Mr Gifford said it is important to stay calm if a snake comes into your yard or home.</p>

<p>He said if you come across one, you should always contact a local snake catcher rather than trying to remove it yourself. </p>

<p>Mr Gifford said if you are bitten by a snake, it is important to act as though it is venomous even if many bites are not.</p>

<p>He said you need to grab something that will put pressure on the wound - such as a piece of clothing or bandage - and wrap the bite four times.</p>

<p>Mr Gifford said the entire limb needs to be tightly wrapped, and the patient needs to be kept calm, so as to reduce blood flow.</p>

<p>However, some circulation must be allowed and it is important to try and mark the bite site.</p>

<p>Mr Gifford said once this is done, the victim should get to the nearest hospital as soon as possible.  </p>
