<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 17-year-old girl faked a brain tumour to found a charity she used con pop stars out of hundreds of thousands of pounds and fund her luxury trips to Disneyland.</p>

<p>Megan Bhari founded Believe in Magic to help 'other' terminally ill children in 2012 before she died in 2018 at age 23.</p>

<p>The charity, backed by the British boyband as well as Taylor Swift, Michael Bublé and Ed Sheeran, was dissolved last week after a Charity Commission investigation found sums of nearly £400,000 missing in its books.</p>

<p>And an inquest recorded Miss Bhari's death as caused by heart failure related to her fatty liver, with no mention of a brain tumour on her medical records.</p>

<p>Megan Bhari, 17, who founded shamed charity Believe in Magic backed by One Direction star Louis Tomlinson, faked a brain tumour to fund lavish trips to Disneyland, it has emerged</p>

<p>Parents of other children with cancer became concerned about her Ms Bhari’s accounts of her illness and started to investigate her before her death.</p>

<p>Joanne Ashcroft, from Wigan, who met her at a charity event for sick children with her son Corey, noticed fundraising appeals for her treatment lacked detail.</p>

<p>She told The Times: 'I spoke to other oncology parents close to me who felt the same.</p>

<p> 'Our own children had been through the most horrific disease and treatments imaginable, there was just something in the words that didn’t ring true.'</p>

<p>Concerned parents found out Ms Bhari had been staying at Walt Disney World in Florida after traveling to the US on cruise liners on planned trips for treatment</p>

<p>They hired a private investigator, who found out Ms Bhari had been staying at Walt Disney World in Florida after traveling to the US on cruise liners on planned trips for treatment.</p>

<p>The investigator also took photos of Ms Bhari in November 2017 returning to Southampton from the US after a post on social media said she had travelled there for treatment.</p>

<p>She was pictured smiling and pushing a trolley with suitcases despite the charity saying her body had 'been through more than any should ever have to and is so weak' at the time.</p>

<p>In the same year, the Charity Commission launched an investigation into Believe in Magic, freezing its accounts following 'multiple complaints'.</p>

<p>Investigators found cash withdrawals of £133,000 had been made in the year to November 2015 and £156,000 was taken out the following year. </p>

<p>Between December 2015 and May 2016, £108,786 was transferred to a trustee and the charity was shut down last week, with remaining funds being given to to the Round Table Children’s Wish. </p>

<p>Ms Bhari's mother Jean O’Brien, 66, one of the charity's trustees, also took a voluntary guarantee not to be a trustee or hold a senior management position at a charity for five years.</p>

<p>Police investigated but said that there was insufficient evidence to take the matter further. </p>

<p>The charity’s ambassadors were One Direction and Louis Tomlinson personally donated £2million to the fund, according to reports.</p>

<p>David Cameron also tweeted his backing to the charity in 2015 and rewarded it with a special Downing Street award.</p>

<p>Last week, Ms O'Brien addressed the Charity's Commission's decision to close it and allegations her daughter had faked her illness.</p>

<p>She wrote on Facebook: 'No one on this earth could have loved Meg more than me. I did everything I could to make her life as wonderful, as happy and as comfortable as it could be. </p>

<p>'The charity grew so quickly and although Meg and I worked tirelessly I take full responsibility for the less than perfect admin and record keeping.</p>

<p>'I am not ashamed to say I have been driven to the brink by these completely untrue and devastating allegations.' </p>
