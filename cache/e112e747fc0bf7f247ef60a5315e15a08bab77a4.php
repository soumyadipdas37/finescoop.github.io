<p>The British High Street favourite shared the clip on Twitter and Instagram this evening - leaving many shoppers giggling over the bright pink toy and its antics (above)</p>

<p>'Watching this on a loop #goldforPercy', wrote one impressed viewer, while another said: 'This is so funny'.</p>

<p>A third demanded 'more Percy content,' as a fourth joked: 'Percy really showed [Tom Daley] how it was done.'</p>

<p>At the start of the clip, the toy is seen preparing his diving moves outside of the water - while Tom looks on in fear as the character constantly falls over.</p>

<p>Percy’s first TikTok, which saw the character working in a boardroom and keeping his team motivated, currently has upwards of 300,000 views.</p>

<p>This second clip was posted with the caption: 'Pigs might not fly but can they dive? We couldn’t be more excited to find out and announce the newest member of Team M&amp;S Food: Tom Daley. </p>

<p>Reaction: Fans of the brand were quick to praise the clip and say how funny they found the advert this evening</p>

<p>However, others used the ad as an opportunity to point out how difficult it was for them to try and find one of the plush Percy Pig toys - which cost £15 for a medium and £25 for a large</p>

<p>'Stay tuned for more from Tom and his very squishable diving partner Percy Pig.'</p>

<p>But some used the ad as an opportunity to share their disappointment at not being able to find one of the cuddly toys - which have reportedly already sold out.</p>

<p>One unimpressed Twitter user said: 'At least Tom can get his hands on one, so hard to find.' </p>

<p>The teddy is based on M&amp;S's famous Percy Pig sweet which was originally released in 1992 and today sells more than 400 million each year.</p>
