<p>Meanwhile, this week sees Coronation Street return to its usual six episodes per week.</p>

<p>But with filming having recently resumed, albeit with social distancing restrictions, fans will now have a more regular fix of the Manchester-based soap.</p>

<p>Coronation Street continues on Monday at 7:30pm and 8:30pm on ITV. </p>
