<p>Sue Barker, 64, (centre) has been axed as host of BBC's A Question Of Sport, alongside team captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell, so that bosses can draft in fresh talent</p>

<p>‘I love the show so much they would have to remove me, it would have been tough for me to walk away,’ she told Sportsmail yesterday.</p>

<p>‘I’ve absolutely loved my 24 years fronting A Question Of Sport, it’s been my dream job,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘But I understand the BBC want to take the show in a new direction and I’m sad to say goodbye.’</p>

<p>Miss Barker will continue with presenting duties for the next two summers at Wimbledon, having signed a three-year deal last year.</p>

<p>Tufnell tweeted that he was ‘going to miss it hugely’. </p>

<p>As recently as July Miss Barker raved about her continued love for the programme – which celebrated its 50th anniversary in January – and said that her 24 years behind the desk had flown by. </p>

<p>‘I love presenting all the sport, but A Question Of Sport is just something that’s so close to my heart,’ she told The Johanna Konta Podcast.</p>

<p>‘I grew up watching it as a kid, I used to be on it and watch with my family, so it’s something that’s always been very special to me.’</p>

<p> The show, which was first broadcast in 1970, has always had a loyal viewership of around three to four million per episode but has failed to attract young viewers</p>

<p>The show, which was first broadcast in 1970, has always had a loyal viewership of around three to four million per episode but has failed to attract young viewers.</p>

<p>Last year Ofcom warned that the BBC could risk losing a ‘generation of viewers’ as less than half of young people aged 16-24 tuned into BBC TV channels in an average week.</p>

<p>The BBC, now led by director-general Tim Davie, said it was dedicated to finding ways to appeal to younger audiences. </p>

<p>The final series of A Question Of Sport featuring Miss Barker, Tufnell and Dawson will be shown next year. </p>
