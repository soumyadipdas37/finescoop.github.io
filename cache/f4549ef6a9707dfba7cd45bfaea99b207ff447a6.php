<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid are planning a mass assault on the transfer market next summer, with the club in firm belief they can finally land Kylian Mbappe.</p>

<p>Madrid, like most of top European sides, have seen their finances trimmed this year due to losses inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>But the Spanish giants have drawn up a methodical battle plan which sees their key targets available to sign in one fell swoop next summer, according to AS in Spain.</p>

<p>Kylian Mbappe is poised to become Real Madrid's marquee signing of summer 2021</p>

<p>Madrid chiefs are readying themselves to make Kylian Mbappe the new jewel of the Bernabeu's crown, while also signing Dayot Upamecano from RB Leipzig and Eduardo Camavinga from Rennes.</p>

<p>AS report that Madrid have specifically engineered this situation due to Upamecano having agreed just a one-year extension in Germany, and teen sensation Camavinga delaying his imminent departure from Ligue 1.</p>

<p>Madrid are also plotting a move for 17-year-old Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga</p>

<p>Dayot Upamecano's one year extension means he is primed to leave Leipzig next summer</p>

<p>With Mbappe the situation is more finely poised.</p>

<p>The contract of the superstar is set to expire in Paris in June 2022, meaning next summer is the final opportunity for PSG to sell him and obtain a respectable fee.</p>

<p>The Parisians will refuse to lose Mbappe as a free agent, given the eye-watering amount of cash they poured into the deal to sign him from Monaco and make him one of their highest paid stars.</p>

<p>Madrid therefore are acutely aware that a strong bid next summer will force PSG's hand, with manager Zinedine Zidane desperate to work with his young compatriot.</p>

<p>AS further report that Madrid have a similar plan in place for the following summer, 2022, in which they intend to carry out a similar bid to sign Erling Haaland as he then prepares to enter the final 12 months of his Borussia Dortmund deal.</p>

<p>Right now, however, Madrid are setting about clearing the dead wood.</p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane is using this summer to clear dead wood, and has finally sold James Rodriguez</p>

<p>The out-of-favour James Rodriguez has finally been officially sold, after rejoining Carlo Ancelotti and signing for Everton.</p>

<p>Madrid are still in limbo regarding Gareth Bale, with the player dragging his heels and determined to see out the final two years of his £15.2m-net-a-season deal. </p>

<p>Bale was willing to leave last summer and accept a lucrative switch to China, only for Madrid to pull the plug at the eleventh hour due to a spate of injuries.</p>

<p>The Welshman was not picked following football's return after the pandemic postponement, and did not travel for his side's crucial Champions League last 16 clash with Manchester City, which Madrid lost. </p>
