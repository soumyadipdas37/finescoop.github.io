<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Three construction workers were given a first hand glimpse of Sydney's new Crown Casino on Tuesday - but not by choice.</p>

<p>Footage uploaded to Reddit showed a trio of workers in a cage suspended by a massive crane bump into James Packer's soon to be completed gambling venue with some degree of force. </p>

<p>Eventually the men made their way down to safety in what looked to be a terrifying experience.</p>

<p>A Reddit user (pictured above) said the experience would have evoked a 'big nope from me' while another said it was an example of 'appalling health and safety'</p>

<p>One Reddit user sympathised with the workers, stating 'that would be a big nope from me' while another pointed to 'appalling health and safety measures.'</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Crown Casino Sydney and construction company Lendlease for comment. </p>

<p>It isn't the first incident of its kind at the soon to be second casino in the harbour city. </p>

<p>In January this year, an unattended crane repeatedly smashed into the $2.4billion casino in Barangaroo as intense winds smashed the city.</p>

<p>The crane repeatedly collided with a single window pane in the high rise building, which will become a casino and luxury apartment block upon completion in December. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Crown Resorts confirmed one of the window panes was shattered in the incident.</p>

<p>'The site was closed at the time, and nobody was injured,' she said at the time.</p>

<p>'A full safety review of the crane equipment is being conducted. Crown is committed to the safety of its employees, contractors and visitors.'</p>

<p>Work is expected to be completed over the coming months before Crown Casino Sydney opens in December (stock image)</p>
