<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The creative force behind one of Australia's hottest new apps met each other by accident in an Uber.  </p>

<p>David Wareing, Tim Nicholas and Silje Dreyer are the entrepreneurs behind GetReminded - a free digital platform dreamed up in a Sydney rideshare that reminds users when their bills, policies, mobile phone plans and insurance premiums are up for renewal. </p>

<p>According to the trio, the simple idea is saving users thousands of dollars a year, they told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>It all started when Mr Wareing returned from overseas after spending about a decade working in motor vehicle marketing. </p>

<p>'The holy grail in automotive marketing was knowing when people wanted to change their car,' Mr Wareing said.</p>

<p>'I thought, instead of brands just spraying messages to people all the time, isn't it better to understand customers a little more, so they know what they need and when they need it?' </p>

<p>He had returned to Sydney and was working as an Uber driver when he picked up Mr Nicholas in 2017 - a digital marketing and website development specialist who had the kind of expertise needed to raise money, promote the concept and get the idea of the ground.</p>

<p>But the pair were still one short when it came to technical experience and design capabilities.</p>

<p>Until the day Ms Dreyer showed up in the back of Mr Wareing's Uber.   </p>

<p>'I have a Master's in interactive design from the University of Sydney and had been working in the sector for a few years,' she said.</p>

<p>'When I met David I was very skeptical at first, but I was really intrigued and I just thought there might really be something here.</p>

<p>Mr Wareing was working as an Uber driver when he picked up Mr Nicholas in 2017 - a digital marketing and website development specialist who had the kind of expertise needed to raise money, promote the concept and get the idea of the ground</p>

<p>'We talked about the idea and I just had a gut feeling... I also had nothing to lose.'</p>

<p>In July 2017, the business went live. </p>

<p>'We started it with a website only. In the tech world they call it a minimum viable product - just to see what the take up would be,' Mr Nicholas said.</p>

<p>'We discovered very quickly that most people were accessing it on their mobile so we knew we have to build this as an app.</p>

<p>Ms Dreyer (pictured) said she had 'a gut feeling' there was something here</p>

<p>'We build version one of our app in just a few months with seed funding, now we are on version three.'</p>

<p>Australia has been a hotbed of start up success with billion-dollar unicorns like Atlassian, Afterpay, Nearmap, Airwallex and 10x Genomics.</p>

<p>GetReminded already has over 23,000 users in Australia and New Zealand, and last month the company launched in the UK and Ireland.</p>

<p>In the near future, GetReminded plans to expand into the US and other markets after securing more funding to scale up and raise brand awareness.     </p>

<p>'There are some calendar apps and reminder services out there but nobody is replicating what we're doing,' Ms Dreyer said.</p>

<p>'What's unique is that it gives you a lot of reminders leading up expiry dates, most apps usually give you a reminder when it's too late and you don't have time to look for a better deal.'</p>

<p>'We are not trying to be a bill paying app, we are not a comparison site, we are not fintech, we are not lending money to people, we are just focused on giving users good consumer help,' Mr Wareing said.</p>
