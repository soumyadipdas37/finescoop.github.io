<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A LEFT-wing terror suspect who threatened Labour leader Keir Starmer has died in prison while awaiting trial.</p>

<p>Dominic Noble was facing 14 charges of terrorism. Of those charges, 13 were for possessing documents likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism.</p>

<p>He was due to stand trial at Leeds crown court on September 11.</p>

<p>Dominic Noble (above) would ring his family from Armley Prison, in Leeds saying he was 'hearing voices' </p>

<p>Noble was arrested in June and was found dead in his cell at Armley Prison, in Leeds on August 15.</p>

<p>Noble - who enjoyed a middle class upbringing in Huddersfield, West Yorks - allegedly made threats to MPs including Mr Starmer and Sajid Javid.</p>

<p>He is also said to have threatened to rip his sister's teeth out, burn down villages and murder BBC journalists for not being left-wing enough over a period of a year.</p>

<p>Most of the posts by the volatile 32-year-old were in reaction to political events although others were seemingly random or sparked by petty family tiffs.</p>

<p>His sister Emily Morely said: 'I started noticing a change in his behaviour in October last year.</p>

<p>'Me and my mum went to Scotland for a week while he stayed in Huddersfield, and for the entire time he was having a mental breakdown, threatening to commit suicide.</p>

<p>'Obviously, my brother was suffering, but he had serious issues.</p>

<p>'In many ways, I was hoping him being locked up would force him to get the help he really needed.</p>

<p>'While he was in prison, he'd be ringing my mum and my grandma every day, talking about how he was hearing voices, worrying that someone was going to try and kill him.'</p>

<p>A Prison Service spokesperson said: 'HMP Leeds prisoner Dominic Noble died on 15 August.</p>

<p>'The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman has been informed.'</p>
