<p>Ukrainian Usyk is the mandatory challenger for the WBO world heavyweight championship, should he overcome Dereck Chisora and Joshua beats Kubrat Pulev.</p>

<p>Oleksandr Usyk is the mandatory challenger for the WBO world heavyweight championship </p>

<p>Usyk's team are determined to ensure Anthony Joshua obeys WBO rules and pair meet in ring</p>

<p>'Usyk has been the WBO mandatory challenger for more than one year,' his co-promoter Alexander Krassyuk told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'He has agreed to let AJ versus Pulev happen, with regards that the winner fights him next. This statement is still solid.</p>

<p>'Our plan is A) beat Derek Chisora B) push AJ to comply with WBO rules or vacate the title C) defeat AJ or any other WBO champion or contender and become the heavyweight champion. Simple and practical.'  </p>

<p>Usyk's camp insist AJ must match-up with their man before Tyson Fury fights Joshua</p>

<p>If Joshua side-stepped the former cruiserweight he would have to relinquish the WBO title, taking away the chance to unify the division in the Battle of Britain.</p>

<p>Fury must defend his WBC belt against Deontay Wilder first - a bout that could take place as late as February 2021 -  while Joshua will face IBF mandatory challenger Pulev in their postponed duel in December. </p>

<p>If Joshua and Usyk line up a fight, fans will have to expect the Battle of Britain to be pushed back.</p>
