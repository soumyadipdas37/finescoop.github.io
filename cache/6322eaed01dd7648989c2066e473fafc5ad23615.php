<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hundreds of firefighters battled two large wildfires Friday that threatened to merge near the most populated part of Oregon, including the suburbs of Portland, and the governor said dozens of people are missing in other parts of the state as the death toll is expected to climb significantly.</p>

<p>Authorities in Oregon, California, and Washington State reported at least 25 dead on Friday.</p>

<p>Oregon's emergency management director, Andrew Phelps, said officials are 'preparing for a mass fatality event' and that thousands of structures have been destroyed.</p>

<p>Governor Kate Brown said more than 40,000 Oregonians have been evacuated and about 500,000 are in different levels of evacuation zones, either having been told to leave or to prepare to do so. </p>

<p>A change in the weather, with winds dropping and shifting direction and humidity rising, greatly helped firefighters struggling to prevent two fires - one burning southeast of Portland and the other east of Salem, the state capital - from advancing farther west into more-populated areas.</p>

<p>'The wind laid down quite a bit for us yesterday. There also wasn't that strong eastern wind that was pushing the fire more to the west,' said Stefan Myers of the state's fire information team.</p>

<p>Winds coming from the Pacific Ocean also neutralized the fires' advance and even pushed them back, Myers said.</p>

<p>Almost 500 personnel were working on the fires, which were just a few miles (kilometers) apart, with rugged terrain between them that limits boots-on-the-ground efforts to keep them apart, Myers said. </p>

<p>If they merge, they could generate such heat that it causes embers to fly thousands of feet into the air, potentially igniting other areas, Myers said.</p>

<p>The high number of fires occurring simultaneously in the span of just a few days in Oregon was fueled by dry conditions, high temperatures and especially strong, swirling winds.</p>

<p>Brown said Thursday that more than 1,400 square miles have burned in Oregon over the past three days, nearly double the land that burns in a typical year in the state and an area greater than the size of Rhode Island.</p>

<p>Oregon officials haven't released an exact death count for the wildfires, but at least five fatalities have been reported in the state. </p>

<p>'When we were driving away and I could see actual fire, the red and orange flames, at the time I didn't feel scared, I had so much adrenaline - we just had to leave,' she said Friday from the livestock stables of the evacuation center at the State Fairgrounds in Salem.</p>

<p>One fire approached Molalla, triggering a mandatory evacuation order for the community of about 9,000 located 30 miles south of Portland. </p>

<p>A police car rolled through the streets with a loudspeaker blaring 'evacuate now.'</p>

<p>With the two large fires - called the Beachie Fire and the Riverside Fire - threatening to merge, some firefighters in Clackamas County, which encompasses Molalla, were told to disengage temporarily Thursday because of the danger. </p>

<p>Officials tried to reassure residents who abandoned their homes and law enforcement officials said police patrols would be stepped up to prevent looting.</p>

<p>The change in weather also aided efforts to contain a fire near Lincoln City, on the Oregon Coast, that according to an estimate has damaged or destroyed at least 100 structures.</p>

<p>'Thank God, we got a wind shift. The wind started coming from the west, pushing the fire back towards the east, and that's what kept it within its footprint and kept it from growing,' fire spokesperson Ashley Lertora said.</p>

<p>Oregon's congressional delegation announced Friday that the White House has approved the state's request for an emergency declaration that will help provide immediate assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>

<p>Jackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler said Friday that a 41-year-old man was jailed on two charges of arson for a fire that started Tuesday in the Phoenix area in southern Oregon.</p>

<p>Sickler said the Almeda fire, which burned hundreds of homes, had ignition points in Ashland near the spot where a man was found dead, and in Phoenix. </p>

<p>Authorities said the man was arrested at the second ignition point in Phoenix and that he denied starting the fire.</p>

<p>Emergency responders in the Pacific Northwest are fighting misinformation along with raging wildfires as people spread unsubstantiated social media posts blaming coordinated groups of arsonists from both the far left and far right for setting the blazes.</p>

<p>The FBI said Friday that it's investigated several claims and found them to be untrue, while officials in Oregon and Washington state have turned to Facebook to knock down the competing narratives - some posts blamed far-left antifa activists and others claimed the far-right group the Proud Boys was responsible for the fires scorching wide swaths of the region.</p>

<p>'I am physically and emotionally exhausted. We've been working really hard to protect people's lives and homes,' firefighter Matt Lowery wrote Thursday night on the Facebook page for the East Pierce Fire &amp; Rescue union south of Seattle. </p>

<p>'I also want to address an issue that keeps coming up, even from some of the public that we are talking to while working. It is hot, dry, and fire spreads quickly in those conditions. There is nothing to show its Antifa or Proud Boys setting fires. Wait for information.'</p>

<p>The Mason County Sheriff's Office urged Washington residents to stop spreading rumors as isolated incidents of apparent arson led to widespread, unfounded claims that antifa agitators were conspiring to start fires along the West Coast. </p>

<p>Several social media accounts with wide followings have been pushing unsubstantiated rumors about arsonists lighting fires in Oregon, Washington, and California</p>

<p>Paul Romero, a Republican candidate for the US Senate, tweeted without evidence that members of antifa were arrested for arson</p>

<p>Antifa is short for anti-fascists, a range of far-left militant groups that oppose white supremacists.</p>

<p>'Though some agencies have made arrests related to arson recently, they appear to all be separate individuals, however as with many incidents, it will be an ongoing investigation in each jurisdiction,' the agency wrote Thursday night on Facebook.</p>

<p>While some arson arrests have been made, it's not yet clear how all the scores of fires in Washington state and Oregon started. </p>

<p>Officials say high winds and dry conditions have made them worse in a region with a cool, wet climate that's historically protected it from intense fire activity. </p>

<p>Both Oregon Governor Kate Brown and Washington Governor Jay Inslee have called the wildfires 'unprecedented.'</p>

<p>The false claims come as left- and right-wing groups have clashed during protests in the Pacific Northwest, particularly in Portland, Oregon, where a caravan of President Donald Trump's supporters drove pickup trucks through the liberal city last month. </p>

<p>An antifa supporter shot and killed a member of a right-wing group and was fatally shot by Washington state authorities a week later.</p>

<p>Local law enforcement agencies have posted messages urging members of the public to stop spreading rumors</p>

<p>The FBI said it worked with local authorities to investigate claims that extremists set wildfires and found them to be false.</p>

<p>'Conspiracy theories and misinformation take valuable resources away local fire and police agencies working around the clock to bring these fires under control,' an FBI statement said. </p>

<p>'Please help our entire community by only sharing validated information from official sources.'</p>

<p>Officials in Oregon also debunked claims this week of widespread arrests affiliated with the Proud Boys or antifa.</p>

<p>'Remember when we said to follow official sources only,' the Douglas County Sheriff's Office posted Thursday. </p>

<p>'Remember when we said rumors make this already difficult incident even harder? Rumors spread just like wildfire and now our 9-1-1 dispatchers and professional staff are being overrun with requests for information and inquiries on an UNTRUE rumor that 6 Antifa members have been arrested for setting fires in DOUGLAS COUNTY, OREGON.'</p>

<p>Medford, Oregon, police knocked down a fake graphic spreading online that used the department's logo and a photo from an unrelated 2018 arrest to falsely claim five Proud Boys had been arrested for arson.</p>

<p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also asking the public to 'share information from trusted, official sources'</p>

<p>'Conspiracy theories and misinformation take valuable resources away [from] local fire and police agencies working around the clock to bring these fires under control,' the FBI said</p>

<p>A social media post shared widely on Thursday featured a picture of a woman along with claims that she tried to start a fire near a high school in Springfield, Oregon. </p>

<p>Springfield police told The Associated Press that they spoke to the woman Wednesday and that wasn't true.</p>

<p>Another post claimed a landowner called police after arsonists threw Molotov cocktails on his land in Clackamas County and they got into a shootout. </p>

<p>The Clackamas County Sheriff´s Office told the AP that no such reports existed.</p>

<p>Freelance journalist Justin Yau tweeted Thursday that he was told to leave the small town of Molalla, Oregon, by an 'armed group' that feared outsiders after seeing rumors of arson nearby.</p>

<p>Thousands of Twitter and Facebook users shared posts trying to link the fires to antifa activists, including from Paul Romero, a former Republican candidate for US Senate in Oregon.</p>

<p>Reached by phone, Romero blamed the surge in fires statewide on a coordinated 'army of arsonists' but offered no evidence to support that claim.</p>

<p>The posts also are being shared by social media accounts associated with QAnon, a conspiracy theory centered on the baseless belief that Trump is waging a secret campaign against enemies in the so-called deep state and a child sex trafficking ring.</p>

<p>Police are investigating a fire that originated in Ashland, Oregon, as a potential arson after finding human remains, Jackson County Sheriff Nathan Sickler told reporters Wednesday.</p>

<p>However, Ashland Deputy Police Chief Art LeCours confirmed to the AP that the case has 'no connection whatsoever to antifa.'</p>

<p>The Jackson County Sheriff´s Office hasn't made any arrests and its investigation shows no evidence at this point of a coordinated effort, spokesman Mike Moran said.</p>

<p>'These investigations take time,' he said. </p>

<p>'They're intense. They're fast moving. And so people ought to consider: "Does this even make sense?" </p>

<p>'They should question anything they see in a social media setting.' </p>

<p>Police are still investigating the first ignition point in Ashland.</p>

<p>In southern Oregon near the California state line, much of the small town of Phoenix was wiped out. </p>

<p>A mobile home park, houses and businesses were burned, leaving twisted remains on charred ground.</p>

<p>Many of the residents were immigrants, with few resources to draw on.</p>

<p>Artemio Guterrez, a single father of four, had been at work at a vineyard when he saw thick smoke spreading through Rogue River Valley. </p>

<p>He snatched his kids to safety. They escaped with only the clothes they were wearing.</p>

<p>'I'm going to start all over again. It's not easy but it's not impossible either,' said Guterrez.</p>

<p>In a news conference Friday, Washington Governor Jay Inslee noted that the amount of land burned in just the past five days amounted to the state's second-worst fire season, after 2015. </p>

<p>He called the blazes 'climate fires' rather than wildfires.</p>

<p>'This is not an act of God,' Inslee said. </p>

<p>'This has happened because we have changed the climate of the state of Washington in dramatic ways.'</p>

<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom offered some of his most impassioned comments on climate change, denouncing the 'ideological BS' of those who deny the danger and vowing Friday to accelerate the state's already ambitious goals for reducing greenhouse gasses.</p>

<p>Newsom spoke against a backdrop of ghost-like trees and ground covered in snow-like gray ash left by the deadliest of the record-breaking fires that have charred huge swaths of California in recent weeks.</p>

<p>'The data is self-evident, the experience that we have in the state of California just underscoring the reality of the ravages of climate change,' he said. </p>

<p>'Mother Nature is physics, biology and chemistry. She bats last and she bats one thousand. That's the reality we're facing, the smash mouth reality - this perfect storm. The debate is over around climate change.'</p>

<p>Two Republican state lawmakers who represent the Northern California region where Newsom spoke countered that the governor is using climate change as an excuse for years of failed policies by fellow Democrats who control nearly all aspects of California government.</p>

<p>The state's former governor, Jerry Brown, who championed combating climate change, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that the massive fires in the West may get more people thinking about the role of climate change 'as they cough and choke on this terrible air.'</p>

<p>But he said it won't change the minds of those who view global warming as fiction.</p>

<p>'This is not enough,' he said. </p>

<p>'But don't worry, we´re going to have this over and over, with hurricanes, with flooding of subways in places in Florida and New Orleans and Texas,' he said.</p>

<p>'The weather is changing, and human beings can´t snap their fingers and tell the weather: 'Don't change",' said Brown, who left office last year and now serves as chairman of the California-China Climate Institute at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

<p>'The weather is changing because of the chemicals that human beings are putting into the air all over the world.'</p>

<p>Newsom was more blunt, saying 'unless we get our act together on climate change, unless we disabuse ourselves of all the BS that's being spewed by a very small group of people,' then time to take action will be lost.</p>

<p>Newsom noted that just in the last month, California had its hottest August, with world-record-setting heat in Death Valley. </p>

<p>It had 14,000 dry lightning strikes that set off hundreds of fires, some that combined into creating five of the 10 largest fires in the state's recorded history.   </p>

<p>A change in the weather, with winds dropping and shifting direction and humidity rising, greatly helped firefighters struggling to prevent two fires - one burning southeast of Portland and the other east of Salem, the state capital - from advancing farther west into more-populated areas </p>

<p>And it had back-to-back heat waves stretching through the Labor Day weekend.</p>

<p>California already is leading the nation in lowering its carbon output, Newsom said, but 'we're going to have to do more and we're going to have to fast-track our efforts.'</p>

<p>The state's ambitious goal of using 100% clean energy by 2045 'is inadequate,' Newsom argued. </p>

<p>'We're going to have to be more aggressive in terms of meeting our goals much sooner.'</p>

<p>He said the state must push to more quickly adopt electric vehicles and other non-polluting transportation, and ordered the heads of his environmental protection and natural resources agencies to explore more changes to the state's industrial and agricultural policies.</p>

<p>Newsom finally called for voters to unseat politicians 'across the spectrum' who deny the effects of climate change, saying he was not just criticizing President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Republican state Sen. Jim Nielsen and Assemblyman James Gallagher countered that the cause of recent devastating wildfires and electricity blackouts 'is decades of bad policy enacted by Democrats, not climate change.'</p>

<p>'The excuse of climate change cannot be used to deflect from the fundamental failure to address the fuels build-up in our forests that are the cause of these devastating fires,' they said in a statement.</p>

<p>'These same misguided policy decisions have led to rolling blackouts and an energy grid that is falling apart.' </p>
