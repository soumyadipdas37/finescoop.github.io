<p>Candid: Dr Zoe Williams has revealed how she pleaded with her alcoholic mother to stop drinking as a teenager and ended up leaving home at 18 (pictured on This Morning)</p>

<p>Dr Zoe said: 'I was barely 16 when I stood before my mum, pleading and crying, before going to school. I was begging her to choose me instead of alcohol.</p>

<p>'Mum tried to take her own life several times in the grip of her addiction. She wasn’t successful but her attempts made it clear living was excruciating for her.'    </p>

<p>Dr Zoe explained that when she was 14 her mother Marilyn, who was a 'caring' woman, started drinking heavily when she got into a relationship.</p>

<p>She said what started out as just a glass had turned into drinking vodka everyday by the time Dr Zoe was studying for her A-Levels.  </p>

<p>Family: The TV doctor explained how 'at the height of her addition' her mum Marilyn 'tried to take her life several times' adding that they were unsuccessful (pictured in a snap shared to Instagram in 2017 on the third anniversary of her death)</p>

<p>As things got harder, Dr Zoe decided to leave home at 18 because it was easier to sofa-surf than not know what her mother's mood would be like.   </p>

<p>And after going to medical school, Dr Zoe admitted that she didn't have the best relationship with alcohol herself and would always be worrying about her mum. </p>

<p>However during her time studying Marilyn did get some help from her GP, but sadly  nothing worked. </p>

<p>She said: 'Mum hated being told what to do in rehab so would leave. I was at medical school when I finally accepted Mum would drink herself into an early grave.'   </p>

<p>Worrying times: Dr Zoe told her mum's story as it was revealed that the number of heavy drinkers doubled between February and August (pictured on This Morning)</p>

<p>Discussing how alcoholism changed her mother, Zoe revealed that she had changed from a loving person to someone who could be 'violent and upset'.     </p>

<p>Marilyn died in 2017 from alcohol-related heart failure, with her two children Dr Zoe and son Linton by her side. </p>

<p>Revealing her personal story, Dr Zoe said that she's now backing the Commission on Alcohol Harm’s call for a government strategy to deal with alcoholism.</p>

<p>The doctor explained that when she was a teenager she could go to school to get a break, but millions of young people haven't had that chance during lockdown.  </p>

<p>Throwback: She said that she decided to leave home at 18 and sofa surf as her mother's moods could be difficult to judge (pictured at 19)</p>

<p>She also quoted new figures that show the number of heavy drinkers in the UK doubled between February and August.</p>

<p>A major report said on Monday that Britain is facing a 'looming addiction crisis' with millions turning to alcohol to cope with the pandemic.</p>

<p>The number of people drinking at 'high risk' levels has doubled to almost 8.5million since February, according to the Royal College of Psychiatrists.</p>

<p>Experts fear money worries, the stresses of juggling work and childcare and the emotional fallout from the virus has left many reaching for the bottle.</p>

<p>Thousands more sought help for addiction to painkillers during lockdown amid fears delays to NHS treatment could cause cases to rocket.</p>

<p>Doctors are worried excessive drinking during the pandemic will have a major toll on the health of the nation for years to come.</p>

<p>In surveys of more than 10,000 people PHE found that more than 8.4million are now drinking at problem levels, up from 4.8million in February.</p>

<p>The problem is rife among the middle class where more than four in ten are now consuming too much alcohol, up from almost 28 per cent in February. </p>
