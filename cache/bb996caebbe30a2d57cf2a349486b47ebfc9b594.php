<p>The 29-year-old management consultant was evicted for the first time ever after previously winning season 14 of Big Brother in 2012.</p>

<p>Ian was on the chopping block with Tyler Crispen, 25, who was a member of the six-person The Committee alliance.</p>

<p>Game over: Ian Terry was evicted Thursday from Big Brother All-Stars by a 5-3 vote and become the first jury member on the CBS show</p>

<p>The former champ had a final two pact with fellow former winner Nicole Franzel, 28, who was torn by her allegiance to The Committee.</p>

<p>Dani Donato, 34, as Head of Household had put Ian up for eviction as the 'ultimate pawn', as she intended for her alliance member Tyler to remain in the game.</p>

<p>Ian conferred with Nicole who was crying at the prospect of losing him.</p>

<p>Dani meanwhile told Da'Vonne Rogers, 32, that she still wanted to work with her even though Da'Vonne used her power of veto to save Kevin Campbell, 40, resulting in Ian being nominated for eviction.</p>

<p>First time: The 29-year-old management consultant was evicted for the first time ever after previously winning season 14 of Big Brother in 2012</p>

<p>Ian met with Dani who swore that she was going to campaign against Tyler.</p>

<p>'I'm lying to Ian right now because I need him to feel as safe as possible,' Dani admitted in a confessional.</p>

<p>Dani and Tyler meanwhile both swore allegiance to each other while privately admitting they would still target one another.</p>

<p>Not honest: 'I'm lying to Ian right now because I need him to feel as safe as possible,' Dani Donato admitted in a confessional.</p>

<p>Ian tried to gain the support of Memphis Garrett, 37, but The Committee member shared his wariness to back him.</p>

<p>The game strategy became evident to Ian who became outraged at Dani's move.</p>

<p>'I don't know where she got the idea I would be, like, a safe bet. This might be the end of it for me because of a big mistake, and it is not even mine,' Ian told Nicole.</p>

<p>Big mistake: 'I don't know where she got the idea I would be, like, a safe bet. This might be the end of it for me because of a big mistake, and it is not even mine,' Ian told Nicole Franzel</p>

<p>Nicole promised Ian that she would campaign for him to stay, but her efforts fell on deaf ears.</p>

<p>Kevin and Da'Vonne meanwhile were suspicious that Tyler wasn't campaigning and figured his confidence came from the assurance of an alliance. </p>

<p>Nicole when it came time to vote maintained her allegiance to The Committee and tearfully voted to evict  Ian.</p>

<p>Tough vote: Nicole when it came time to vote maintained her allegiance to The Committee and tearfully voted to evict Ian</p>

<p>'This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do,'' Nicole sobbed while casting her vote.</p>

<p>Ian was hugged by everyone after he was evicted and put on a face mask for his interview with host Julie Chen Moonves, 50, amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>He admitted that it 'hurt' being booted from the game, but realized he was a prime target as a former champion.</p>

<p>Ian watched taped messages from the houseguests and learned of the larger alliance at work.</p>

<p>He congratulated them for having a good plan that worked well enough to eliminate him.</p>

<p>Julie then introduced the new Head of Household competition that Dani was sitting out even though she held a Replay power that would've allowed her to compete.</p>
