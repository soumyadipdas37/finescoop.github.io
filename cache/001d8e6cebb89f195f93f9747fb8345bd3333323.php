<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Woolworths Ooshies craze reappeared in supermarkets across Australia on August 26 - and now customers are attempting to sell the miniature collectable Disney Plus toys on eBay for thousands of dollars.</p>

<p>One shopper from New South Wales set an immense price tag of $50,000 for their 'rare' glitter Elsa from Frozen figurine, even though this toy is quite common.</p>

<p>Another shopper from Queensland also priced their glitter Star Wars The Mandalorian Ooshies for a starting bid of $9,000, while another from the ACT has set the cost to $10,000 for their glitter Woody from Toy Story.</p>

<p>There are currently no online bids for each sparkly Ooshies toy.</p>

<p>Another shopper from Queensland priced their sparkly Star Wars The Mandalorian Ooshies for a starting bid of $9,000</p>

<p>But in some occasional cases, few customers have been eager to pay the excessive amounts of cash in order to complete their collection.</p>

<p>Last week two rare Simba Ooshies from the previous Lion King collection were sold for a sum of $15,000.</p>

<p>The complete Lion King set is also currently selling on eBay between $5,000 and $7,000.</p>

<p>In other instances, some eBay sellers are willing to help customers complete the new Disney Plus Ooshies collection and are selling specific individual Ooshies for $3.99 each. </p>

<p>Another shopper from the ACT has set the cost to $10,000 for their glittery Woody from Toy Story</p>

<p>The collection features 36 Ooshies, which follows the success of last year's wildly popular Lion King Ooshies</p>
