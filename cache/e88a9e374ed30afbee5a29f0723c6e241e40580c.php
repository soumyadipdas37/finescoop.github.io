<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea's summer spending was supposed to close the gap to Liverpool and Manchester City this season, instead fans are raging at a shocking first-half. </p>

<p>The Blues found themselves 3-0 down to West Brom at half-time on Saturday night, with Callum Robinson scoring in the fourth and 25th minutes, before Kyle Bartley left Chelsea with a mountain to climb just two minutes later </p>

<p>New signing and Premier League debutant Thiago Silva's slip was at fault for Robinson's second, with Frank Lampard's men reacting sluggishly.  </p>

<p>Frank Lampard is already taking criticism after his side's horrendous West Brom collapse </p>

<p>The Blues went in 3-0 down at half-time after a Callum Robinson brace as Kyle Bartley strike </p>

<p>Thiago Silva was at fault for West Brom's second, costing Chelsea on his Premier League debut</p>

<p>Willy Caballero, brought in for the dropped Kepa Arrizabalaga, was no improvement on the out-of-form Spaniard either.   </p>

<p>Lampard's spending has totalled more than £220m this summer, bringing in seven new faces including Kai Havertz and Timo Werner. </p>

<p>While Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech, Edouard Mendy and Malang Sarr are yet to feature for the club and others are bedding in, the collapse is a severely worrying sign for the Blues. </p>

<p>Many fans are already losing patience, with <?php echo e('@'); ?>Kovaholic writing: 'Sack him in the tunnel. I've not witnessed anything more embarrassing in 15 years of watching Chelsea.' </p>

<p>Willy Caballero also endured a tough first-half, not impressing in Kepa Arrizabalaga's palce </p>

<p>Echoing the criticism of Lampard, <?php echo e('@'); ?>ekwunife_dan added: 'Sign all the players in the world, it will never cover Lampard's useless tactics. </p>

<p>'Lampard has been exposed! He is just another average English manager. No style. No tactics.'</p>

<p>Chelsea finished fourth last season and are looking to build towards a title challenge but Frank Lampard clearly has serious work to do on his defensive organisation.  </p>
