<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jim Edmonds has opened up about the allegations of a threesome that surfaced in January after his marriage to Meghan King fell apart.</p>

<p>In a rambling phone interview with Andy Cohen on Monday the former baseball player claimed that it was his ex-wife that pushed for a threesome but allegations that it happened are 'false'.  </p>

<p>It was January this year, three months after Jim, 50, filed for divorce from Meghan, that the former Real Housewives of Orange County star identified his new girlfriend Kortnie O'Connor as her ex-friend, also claiming they once enjoyed a threesome together.</p>

<p>False: Jim Edmonds says allegations he had a threesome with ex-wife Meghan King and new girlfriend Kortnie O'Connor during his marriage are false. He claims Meghan was pushing for a three-way but it never happened</p>

<p>Andy got straight to it and asked Jim in his latest installment of SiriusXM’s Andy Cohen Live: 'Was there something about three ways... or were you trying to have them? Or...'</p>

<p>'I'm going to cut you off right there. That was all false too. That was a joke. I don't even know how she comes up with this stuff.' Jim replied.</p>

<p>'Um, to be honest with you, I mean, if we really want to go down that road, she was the one that was pushing for them. And I was like, this, this is completely ridiculous. Um, and she just made up these stories.' he added.</p>

<p>The former MLB star accused Meghan of making it up for a storyline and revealed his life is better than ever without the blonde reality star.</p>

<p>'It's been make believe for a long time. So I'm just glad that I'm out of it and I'm happy and everything's going good. And I've turned my life around.'</p>

<p>Jim's new comments contradict what he said earlier this year in response to Meghan's allegations he was dating their former threesome partner. </p>

<p>'That was a joke. I don't even know how she comes up with this stuff.' Jim said - referring to Meghan - when he spoke to to Andy Cohen on his radio show on Monday</p>

<p>Jim said 'To be honest with you, I mean, if we really want to go down that road, she was the one that was pushing for them. And I was like, this, this is completely ridiculous.' He is pictured here with Meghan during their marriage</p>

<p>Jim's new comments contradict what he said earlier this year in response to Meghan's allegations he was dating their former threesome partner</p>

<p>'Years ago, when he and I got married, I knew Jim had this bad boy kind of past, and we were newlyweds and we were trying to have fun, and he wanted to have a threesome,' Meghan said on her podcast, Intimate Knowledge.</p>

<p>'I thought about it and I thought, "Okay, maybe, yeah sure." So we decided to have a threesome with a friend of mine. I felt very comfortable with her, it just felt like "Okay if I'm going do this, this can be with who and I'm comfortable with that."' </p>

<p>The mother-of-three admitted she was hurt seeing Jim with her former friend.</p>

<p>'The threesome girl. … This girl, who I thought was my friend. I cast aside my [discomfort] with threesomes. And then this girl.'</p>

<p>Jim hit back at Meghan's claims in a statement to PEOPLE, saying that Meghan and Kortnie 'have not spoken in over three years' and that she had been the one to initiate sex with Kortnie, adding that they’d had 'more than a few' threesomes throughout their relationship.</p>

<p>Meghan responded to his statement telling PEOPLE, 'We only had one threesome and only once during our marriage and that was with his current girlfriend.' </p>

<p>Jim claimed in January that Meghan had initiated the threesome with Kortnie and that they had had 'more than a few' threesomes throughout their relationship</p>

<p>Jim also discussed the sexting scandal back in 2018 when he was caught sending an inappropriate picture to a woman while Meghan was pregnant with their two sons Hart and Hayes. </p>

<p>He explained, 'This girl blackmailed me and there was nothing I could do about it. And that's the sad thing. It's almost like it was almost like a catfish blackmail, double duo. Cause this chick was hideous and I'd never met her before. She was sending me pictures.' </p>

<p>He admitted regret for getting into the situation but insisted it was not the cause of his marriage failing.</p>

<p>'It was a mess. It was my fault. I shouldn't have sent the picture, but I mean, I made a mistake and I live by it. And that's not the reason for the marriage falling apart at all.' </p>

<p>Jim and Meghan married in 2014 after dating for a year and a half. They have a daughter Aspen, four, together as well as Hayes and Hart, two. </p>

<p>They split in October 2019 when Jim filed for divorce amid rumors he had an affair with their former nanny, Carly Wilson. (Both Jim and Carly have denied having a sexual relationship).</p>
