<p>A DailyMail.com request for comment to Boston University was not immediately returned.</p>

<p>An unidentified witness told Boston 25 News that she 'heard just an ungodly scream'.</p>

<p>'We ran into the hallway and saw a gentlemen who was in distress screaming and hyperventilating and saying she's dead, she's dead'.</p>

<p>The building's residents weren't allowed inside for about 90 minutes as police worked the scene and were told that the elevator was stuck between the first floor and the basement.   </p>

<p>Management of the building said the elevator was inspected within the past year </p>

<p>In a statement, a spokesperson from the state's Division of Professional Licensure said officials from the Office of Public Safety and Inspections determined that the elevator was recently inspected and certified in accordance with state regulations</p>

<p>Eric Carmichael told CBS that his wife was on the first floor when the accident occurred. </p>

<p>He said she told him that it all happened so fast and there was nothing she could do to help.   </p>

<p>'The lady was trying to put her package into the elevator, like that's how we do it. Take it from the lobby,' Carmichael told the station. </p>

<p>'I guess maybe the package and the woman were over the limit of what the elevator could handle so then what my wife said she saw was the lady's arms like hanging onto her package.'</p>

<p>Carmichael called the accident terrifying because any it could have been any of the residents inside when the elevator malfunctioned.  </p>

<p>'Terrible old elevator that should have been probably kept up better,' he added.</p>

<p>Another resident told CBS that the elevator is an old system. </p>

<p>'It's a two-slide door system and unless that door is completely shut, it does not move ever,' Nevada Foskit said. 'If something did happen, it clearly had to be faulty.'</p>
