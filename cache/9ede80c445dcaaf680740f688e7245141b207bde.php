<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ryan GiggsÂ believes Gareth Bale will be even better for Wales at Euro 2020 after ending his Real Madrid nightmare by rejoining Tottenham on loan.</p>

<p>Bale enjoyed huge success in the Spanish capital, winning four Champions League titles, but a breakdown in relations with coach Zinedine Zidane paved the way for him to move back to Spurs for at least one season.</p>

<p>Despite his recent lack of playing time in Madrid, Bale has usually shone on international duty, and Giggs is confident that more regular football will make the 31-year-old an even more dangerous opponent at next summer's tournament.</p>

<p>Ryan Giggs believes Gareth Bale will be even better for Wales at next summer's Euros</p>

<p>Giggs said: 'It doesn't matter what quality and experience he possesses, it's always better when you are playing, especially in the international arena when you have two games in a short space of time.</p>

<p>'To play a game and then go again a few days later is very difficult. It will be so much better if he is playing regularly, he will be sharper and able to play those two games in a short space of time.</p>

<p>'It is always difficult. He's been able to manage it and produce performances because he looks after himself but it will be so much better when he is playing regularly.'</p>

<p>Giggs is confident more regular football will make the 31-year-old even more dangerous</p>

<p>Bale was left out of the squad for the friendly against England at Wembley next Thursday, as well as the Nations League fixtures in Ireland and Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Giggs expects that Bale will soon recapture his best form now he is working with Jose Mourinho in north London.</p>

<p>He added: 'He's at a club he knows well with a very good manager and he's said himself it's like going back home.</p>

<p>'He will play more regularly than he did at Madrid. It's a good move for Gareth, it's good for Spurs and good for the Premier League in general, to have someone like that who we can watch every week.'</p>
