<p>Kelly's appearance came after she vowed to slim down after admitting her weight 'crept back up' during national lockdown. </p>

<p>The voluptuous host, who previously insisted she wasn't worried about weight gain, has pinpointed dress sizes 10-12 as her ultimate goal after embarking on a new diet. </p>

<p>She is attempting to lose her lockdown weight by taking on the SlimFast challenge, with standard food portions replaced by two meal replacements, three 100-calorie snacks and one 500-calorie meal a day. </p>

<p>Taking to social media for a Q&amp;A on Tuesday, the model insisted she was determined to reach her target having dropped two dress sizes during a previous attempt at dieting in March, again with the SlimFast plan. </p>

<p>Responding to a fan, she wrote: 'I went from a Dress Size 14/16 to a 10/12. I'm curvy so I notice weight loss more in my clothes than on a scale.</p>

<p>'My target now is to get to a size 10/12 again as during lockdown I had some pounds creep back on!' </p>

<p>When asked how quickly it takes to see positive results, she added: 'Usually in my clothes after a week! After lockdown I really wanted to get back into my jeans and dresses so I always notice a change when they start feeling loose and less tight.'  </p>
