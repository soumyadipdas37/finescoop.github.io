<p>Blackfishing is a term used when someone adopts makeup or hair stylings to appear like they have black heritage.</p>

<p>One person wrote underneath a picture of her sporting the braids: 'Hunny cultural appropriation looks so good on you must be why you continue to do it #pleasestop.'</p>

<p>While another said: 'Girl you can't wear that hairstyle...'</p>

<p>Another said: 'I'd rethink the hair.'</p>

<p>However some of her followers supported her decision, with one writing: 'I don't understand the hate. If she appreciates the beauty of your culture and supports it, why are y'all so mad?' </p>

<p>After noticing the comments and receiving some private messages about her style choice, Rebecca took to her Stories to defend the choice.</p>

<p>She said: 'So I've been going through my requests and I've got loads of awful messages which I don't think is fair at all. </p>

<p>'I've had messages saying I'm being disrespectful to people's culture because of my hair but I wear braids all the time, just because I've got a few more braids downs meant I'm being disrespectful.'</p>

<p>Unimpressed: Fans were left unimpressed that she was sporting a hairstyle typically worn by black women, and took to the comments section to express their disapproval</p>

<p>'I don't want to hurt anyone I'm just being myself, I'm doing me. I'm literally just doing me. I had to get someone else to do it, because I can't do it as good as this. Have you seen it they're unreal.</p>

<p>'Also thank you to everyone who has been sending me lovely messages and being so kind, I really appreciate it and I love you all.'</p>

<p>Her beau Biggs then chimed in, and said: 'Just a quick one guys, I'm sorry, basically my point is if a young white boy came to me and said Biggs I like your hair and I want that. I should be happy because I've got something he wants. He's appreciating the culture. I'd be worried if he said urgh I don't want that. It's 2020, it's different.'</p>

<p>Support: However some of her followers supported her decision, with one writing: 'I don't understand the hate. If she appreciates the beauty of your culture and supports it, why are y'all so mad?'</p>

<p>Confused: After noticing the comments and receiving some private messages about her style choice, Rebecca took to her Stories to defend the choice</p>

<p>Rebecca said: 'I think it's nice if you want to embrace other's culture.'</p>

<p>It comes a couple of weeks after Rebecca was accused of cultural appropriation when she took part in a Native American themed photo shoot.</p>

<p>She posted a series of photos on her Instagram showing her in the costume and posing alongside a horse.</p>

<p>In the pictures, Rebecca sported a fringe coat, headdress with feathers, traditional Native American jewellery and holding a long totem pole.</p>

<p>Discussing the shoot, Rebecca added: 'Coming to the photo shoot that I did with the horse, I apologise if anyone felt any upset or hurt, I didn't want to hurt with anyone, it was just generally a photo shoot. I do modelling that's what I do, I didn't mean to intentionally hurt anyone.' </p>
