<p>'It's a screw up!' The Block judge Darren Palmer (far left) issued a SAVAGE assessment of Harry and Tash's bathroom - before screwing his nose up at Daniel and Jade's tiling choices (pictured) on Sunday night's episode </p>

<p>Sunday's episode saw the five teams choosing to style two rooms, one of which had to be a bathroom.  </p>

<p>Harry and Tash's 1920's bedroom started off on a positive note with all three judges, however their ensuite was a very different story.  </p>

<p>While Darren, Shaynna Blaze and Neale Whitaker were in awe of the colour palette and basin choice, Darren noticed a structural nightmare in builders having erected a straight frame crooked.</p>

<p>Positive: Harry and Tash's 1920's bedroom (pictured) started off on a positive note with all three judges, however their ensuite was a very different story </p>

<p>Structural nightmare: However, with their bathroom, Darren noticed a structural nightmare in builders having erected a straight frame crooked </p>

<p>What resulted was uneven tiling, meaning the entire wall beam would have to be taken out and reinstalled.  </p>

<p>'It's a screw up! It's sad that an error like that can undo all of this hard work, especially in this stressful environment,' he said. </p>

<p>Darren was also vocal when it came to assessing Daniel and Jade's 1930's bathroom. </p>

<p>He was in awe of both kids' bedrooms they had styled moments prior, however he admitted to 'pretty much [not liking] all' of their bathroom.</p>

<p>Praise: Darren was in awe of Daniel and Jade's 1930's kids' bedrooms (both pictured) </p>

<p>'These three choices fight against each other': However, when it came to their bathroom, he criticised the use of three different tiles in the space. Pictured: Daniel and Jade </p>

<p>Referencing the three different tiles used, he said: 'When you pair that, with that tile, it's two different feelings. The concrete, the marble and then this. These three choices fight against each other.' </p>

<p>Darren also found fault in missing structural detail on the towel rail and gaps above the tiles on the walls.      </p>

<p>Meanwhile, for Sarah and George's 1940's bedroom and bathroom, it was all positive.</p>

<p>High note: Meanwhile, for Sarah and George's 1940's bedroom (pictured), it was all positive. Judge Neale Whitaker described it as 'breathtaking' with its sweeping ceiling and wall art </p>

<p>No faults here: All three judges commended the couple for their 'quilt-look' tiling in the bathroom (pictured) and the 'spectacular' lighting </p>

<p>All smiles: Sarah and George (pictured) were no doubt happy with the feedback </p>

<p>Shaynna praised the couple for constructing a children's play area above the bed, while Neale and Darren described the room as a 'cute' space.</p>

<p>The judges were also in awe of the bathroom with its mustard and timber tones, with Neale gazing over the 'stunning colour palette'.   </p>

<p>It started off well for Jimmy and Tam with their 1950's bedroom, with Shaynna gushing over the wardrobe space. </p>

<p>He's impressed: Neale also adored their show-stopping feature wall (pictured) </p>

<p>However, when it came to their bathroom in a bright peach and stone colour palette, the judges were concerned that it was too outside of the box.</p>

<p>'This is the hi-vis of bathrooms,' Darren joked, while Shaynna added that it's important to not be 'too niche' when attracting potential buyers.   </p>

<p>The episode saw Luke and Jasmin winning the room reveal with 30 points, followed by a tie on 29 with Sarah and George, and Jimmy and Tam.</p>

<p>Daniel and Jade placed third on 25-and-a-half points, and Harry and Tash on 23-and-a-half.  </p>
