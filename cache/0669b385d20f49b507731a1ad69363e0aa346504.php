<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother-of-two who has gone from a size 18 to a size 10 after losing an impressive four stone in lockdown is now desperate to remove a flap of excess skin on her tummy.</p>

<p>Laura Painter, 27, from Enfield, north London, said she feels the healthiest she's ever been but the folds of skin across her tummy 'get her down' - and she believes it will cost around £8,000 to get rid.</p>

<p>She has started saving up, but is currently unable to do her job - manager of a betting shop - due to the pandemic, so has launched a GoFundMe page to help her raise funds.</p>

<p>Laura said: 'I started saving 2 weeks ago and I'm at £60 currently! I want to have a tummy tuck and have this skin removed so that my quality of life can be better.</p>

<p>Laura, who has always struggled with her weight, said she feels the healthiest she's ever been</p>

<p>Despite feeling proud of herself and her body, Laura admitted the folds of excess skin on her tummy 'get her down'</p>

<p>'I know not everyone will agree with this but I’m only asking for help for some of it as I want to pay for it myself but it’s not possible as of now.'</p>

<p>Laura, who has two daughters aged five and one, tipped the scales at 15st 7lb before the onset of Covid-19. </p>

<p>'I’ve struggled with my weight from a young age,' she said. 'My weight has gone up and gone down so much over the years..</p>

<p>'Having children can be such a strain on our bodies; two babies down and it’s safe to say my stomach is in need of a hand.'</p>

<p>Laura has been charting her progress on her Instagram page <?php echo e('@'); ?>mummalauzz where she shares transformational snaps to help encourage other mothers like her</p>

<p>Laura said: 'I'll always love my Playdoh belly, but I'd prefer a flat one. But I'm not going to hate myself because it isn't flat'</p>

<p>When lockdown hit in March, Laura took up fitness, starting with going jogging and moving onto home workouts. </p>

<p>She gradually incorporated both into her weekly routine, and is now the lightest she's ever been at 11st 8lb and a trim size 10-12. </p>

<p>Speaking about the excess skin that now rests on her tummy, she added: 'It brings me down and just makes me feel sad - but at the same time proud and grateful for what I’ve been able to achieve in such a short amount of time. </p>

<p>'I'll always love my Playdoh belly, but I'd prefer a flat one. But I'm not going to hate myself because it isn't flat.'</p>

<p>After looking into excess skin removal surgery, which she said costs in the region of £8,000 in the UK, Laura began saving two weeks ago.</p>

<p>'I'm at £60 currently!' she said. 'My youngest is only one and not in childcare yet as I’m unable to go to work at the moment.</p>

<p>After looking into excess skin removal surgery, which she said costs in the region of £8,000 in the UK, Laura began saving for hers two weeks ago and launched a fundraising page</p>

<p>'When she's two I’ll be back to work hopefully and able to save more than I have been able to at home.'</p>

<p>Her fundraising target is £2,000, with Laura hoping to pay for the rest of it herself. She has so far received £150 in donations.  </p>

<p>Laura said any donations would be 'so great', adding: 'Please don’t feel forced, but a helping hand never hurt anyone, just helped them.'   </p>
