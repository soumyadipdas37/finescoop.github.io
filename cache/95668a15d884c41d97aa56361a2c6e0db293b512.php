<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bronze statue representing First Lady Melania Trump was unveiled today in her native Slovenia to replace a wooden one that was set on fire in July.</p>

<p>The new sculpture is a replica of the original one commissioned by Berlin-based American artist Brad Downey and placed near Trump's hometown of Sevnica, in central Slovenia.</p>

<p>The original statue was torched by unknown arsonists on July 4th. The life-size rough figure was cut from the trunk of a linden tree and carved with a chainsaw by local folk artist Ales Zupevc.</p>

<p>A bronze statue representing the First Lady Melania Trump is unveiled in her birthplace of Sevnica, Slovenia, on Tuesday</p>

<p>The new bronze statue was erected after a previous one, made in wood, was set alight</p>

<p>The original wooden statue was cut from the trunk of a linden tree and carved with a chainsaw </p>

<p>'I want to know why they did it,' Downey said at the time. </p>

<p>The statue was erected in July 2019 to highlight Melania's status as an immigrant married to an anti-immigration president. It depicted the 50-year-old mother-of-one in a pale blue wraparound dress like the one she wore at Donald Trump's presidential inauguration in January 2017. </p>

<p>A plaque next to the new bronze version reads it is 'dedicated to the eternal memory of a monument to Melania which stood at this location.'</p>

<p>'We are here today because we put up again a statue of Melania to the place where it was burnt and to commemorate the statue that was set on fire,' said Slovenian artist Marko Vivoda.</p>

<p>Perched atop a 9-foot-high wooden pillar, the rustic sculpture has no colors and a face that bears no obvious resemblance to the former model-turned-first lady.</p>

<p>Born Melanija Knavs in nearby Novo Mesto in 1970, the first lady grew up in Sevnica while Slovenia was part of the Communist-ruled former Yugoslavia.</p>

<p>She changed her name to Melania Knauss when she started modelling. She settled in New York in 1996 and met Trump two years later.</p>

<p>They married in January 2005 and share one child - Barron Trump, 14. </p>

<p>In January, a large wooden statue resembling Donald Trump and designed by a local artist in 2019, was burnt in Slovenia's city of Moravce, east of the capital Ljubljana. </p>

<p>The nearly 26-foot high construction, erected last year in the village of Sela pri Kamniku in Slovenia, showed Trump with his trademark hair style, blue suit, white shirt and a long red tie.</p>

<p>Standing atop a 9-foot-high wooden pillar, that rustic sculpture bears no obvious resemblance to the 50-year-old Us first lady </p>

<p>His right arm - fist clenched - was raised high like that of New York's Statue of Liberty.</p>

<p>When triggered, a mechanism inside the statue opened a red-painted mouth and shark-like teeth used to appear.</p>

<p>Tomaz Schlegl, the statue's creator, said when he unveiled the piece last August: 'Like all populists, the statue has two faces. One is humane and nice, the other is that of a vampire.' </p>
