<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new treatment is promising to tackle wrinkles and reverse the signs of aging by using a patient's own frozen live tissue to rejuvenate their skin. </p>

<p>Uvence is the first quality controlled fat transfer facial injection pioneered by Dr Olivier Amar for the Cosmetic Treatment Company in London, who claims it is 'the future' of non-surgical cosmetic treatments. </p>

<p>The procedure, which is 100 per cent natural and costs upwards of £7,500, uses live tissue from a patient that has been frozen and preserved in order to re-plump their skin. </p>

<p>Doctors extract fat cells from an unwanted pocket of fat on the body through a form of micro or mini liposuction, before they are purified and re-injected into the skin.    </p>

<p>A new treatment offers to extract and re-inject the patient's own fat cells  into their skin in order to erase the signs of ageing (pictured: left: before, right: after)</p>

<p>The first step is to have the small amount of fat extracted with a local anesthetic from an area such as the  outer thighs. </p>

<p>The appointment can last 30 minutes and, while slightly uncomfortable afterwards, Dr Amar said the recovery period is minimal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile your tissue will then be placed in a medical-grade Uvence box and sent to the lab to be processed and frozen in a Cryyo Chamber. </p>

<p>When patients are ready for treatment, the frozen cells are injected into the face using a syringe.  </p>

<p>The treatment can be use proactively or when marked sign of ageing have appeared. It claims to erase wrinkles and bring the skin's elasticity back. </p>

<p>Treatments will then last several months.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the company can preserve ten injectable vials taken from the patient for future use for up to five years, allowing doctors and patients multiple uses from a single extraction.</p>

<p>The procedure can be carried out either proactively, as a reaction to signs of ageing, or used to fixed botched filler treatment.  </p>

<p>The procedure has been adopted by other cosmetic consultants as a way to offer 100 per cent natural services to their clients.  </p>

<p>Dr Maryam Zamani, a leading oculoplastic surgeon, said: 'Uvence is an innovative way to harvest small amounts of fat in a short procedure to then prepare into super enriched tissue to help improve quality of the skin. </p>

<p>'It can be used in combination with injectables, energy based treatments and surgery to bolster collagen production and a more youthful preservation.' </p>

<p>Dr. Amar, who is one of Europe's leading aesthetic consultant with 15 years of experience in cosmetic, plastic and reconstructive surgery, claimed that this new treatment is the future of cosmetic procedures.  </p>

<p>Dr Amar said: 'This really is the future of cosmetic skin treatments, it is hugely exciting to see the next step in standardisation and quality for this kind of treatment.' </p>

<p>'The Uvence offering allows access to regenerative and personalised treatments and is the biggest advance in the field for nearly 15 years. </p>

<p>This new treatment is in line with the rising trend of 'tweakments,' or non-invasive, subtle non-surgical procedures bringing minimal changes to the skin. </p>

<p>He said:  'In terms of accessibility and convenience this has never been seen before, the cryopreservation capability allows plastic and cosmetic surgeons alike to provide this treatment on a consistent basis to their patients without the need for further liposuction or tissue extraction.'</p>
