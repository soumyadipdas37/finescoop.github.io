<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With millions around the world stuck at home due to the pandemic, 'plane cafes' in Thailand are offering customers the chance to pretend they are in the sky - and the idea seems to have taken off.</p>

<p>On board a retired commercial airplane in the coastal city of Pattaya, coffee drinkers make themselves comfy on first-class-style seats and pose for photos by the overhead lockers.</p>

<p>Boarding passes in hand, some 'passengers' even opt for a tour of the cockpit.</p>

<p>'With this cafe I can sit in first class and also mess around in the cockpit pretending to be the captain of the plane,' 26-year-old Thipsuda Faksaithong told AFP.</p>

<p>'It's a lot of fun.'</p>

<p>Chalisa Chuensranoi, 25, said her visit was as good as any trip she had taken before the pandemic, which shuttered Thailand's borders in March.</p>

<p>'Sitting right here in the first-class section... really gives me the feeling of actually being on a plane, cruising through the air,' she said.</p>

<p>In another cafe, at the headquarters of national carrier Thai Airways in Bangkok, hungry diners appear even to have missed plane food as they gobble up spaghetti carbonara and Thai-style beef served on plastic trays by cabin crew.</p>

<p>But for Intrawut Simapichet, 38, who came to the cafe with his wife and baby, the experience is about more than a meal.</p>

<p>'Normally I'm a person who travels very often, and when we are forced to stay at home... it's kind of depressing,' he said as fellow passengers posed with luggage by a fake airplane door.</p>

<p>'(The cafe) relieves what's missing.'</p>

<p>For some who visit the cafe, the experience is about more than the plane meals on offer</p>

<p>Thailand was the first country outside China to detect a coronavirus case, but it has since registered a low toll, with about 3,400 infections and 58 deaths.</p>

<p>Travel restrictions have nevertheless eviscerated the tourism-reliant economy, while Thais have founded themselves stuck due to quarantine requirements in other countries.</p>

<p>The government is currently mulling travel bubbles with select countries that also have low tolls.</p>
