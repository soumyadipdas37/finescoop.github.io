<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Growing up in an area with more green space is beneficial to a child's intelligence, according to a new study that found those in greener urban areas had a higher IQ.</p>

<p>A team from Hasselt University, Belgium, analysed IQs of over 600 children and then used satellite images to examine the green coverage of their neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>The children in the study were all aged between 10 and 15, according to the team, who say a 3 per cent increase in greenery led to an IQ increase of about 2.6 points. </p>

<p>Researchers also found that children in the study had lower levels of behavioural problems if they lived in an area that more green coverage.  </p>

<p>IQ point increases as a result of living in a green environment had the biggest impact on those at the lower end of the spectrum as small changes made a big difference. </p>

<p>This is the first time IQ has been considered as a potential benefit of being exposed to green spaces in childhood - other studies have looked at wider cognitive benefits.</p>

<p>The researchers aren't sure exactly why IQ increases with exposure to a green environment, but suspect it could be to do with lower levels of stress.</p>

<p>The data on IQ and location came from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey (EFPTS), a registry of multiple births in the province of East Flanders, Belgium. </p>

<p>The average IQ of those involved was 105 but the team found 4 per cent of the children with a score below 80 had grown up in areas with low greenery levels. </p>

<p>It wasn't just intelligence that was impacted by living in an area that was more green - the team found it also helped improve the behaviour of some of the children.</p>

<p>They found that behavioural problems reduced for every 3 per cent rise in greenery. </p>

<p>The team said that a well planned city could offer unique opportunities to create an 'optimal environment' for children to develop to their full potential.  </p>

<p>'Whereas in 1950, only 30 per cent of the world’s population lived in urban areas; nowadays, this is already more than half of the global population, and it is expected to increase to 68 per cent by 2050,' the team explained. </p>

<p>'There is more and more evidence that green surroundings are associated with our cognitive function,' study author Tim Nawrot told The Guardian.</p>

<p>'I think city builders should prioritise investment in green spaces because it is really of value to create an optimal environment for children to develop their full potential.'</p>

<p>According to the study authors the benefits of greenery recorded in urban areas weren't replicated in more rural communities - likely because those areas had enough green space for everyone to benefit so the effects weren't as localised.</p>

<p>The authors believe that a combination of lower noise levels and lower stress levels found in green space areas contribute to the improvements in IQ and behaviour.</p>

<p>Part of this is also due to the fact there are more opportunities for physical and social activities in areas with more greenery - which can improve IQ scores on their own.  </p>

<p>'Our results indicate that residential green space may be beneficial for intellectual and behavioural development of children living in an urban environment. </p>

<p>'We showed a shift in the IQ distribution of urban children in association with residential green space exposure,' the authors wrote.  </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal PLOS Medicine. </p>

<p>IQ stands for Intelligence Quotient and it is used to measure mental ability.</p>

<p>The abbreviation 'IQ' was first coined by psychologist William Stern to describe the German term Intelligenzquotient.</p>

<p>Historically, IQ is a score achieved by dividing a person's mental age, obtained with an intelligence test, by their age.</p>

<p>The resulting fraction is then multiplied by 100 to obtain an IQ score.</p>

<p>An IQ of 100 has long been considered the median score.</p>

<p>Because of the way the test results are scaled, a person with an IQ of 60 is not half as intelligent as someone with an IQ of 120.</p>

<p>The arrangement of IQ scores also means that results are 'normally distributed', meaning just as many people score either side of the average. </p>

<p>For example, the same amount of people score 70 as people who score 130.</p>

<p>Although the accuracy of intelligence tests is somewhat disputed, they are still widely used.</p>

<p>For Mensa, the acceptance score requires members to be within the top two per cent of the general population.</p>

<p>Depending on the IQ test, this can require a score of at least 130.</p>
