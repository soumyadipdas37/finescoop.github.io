<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leaked internal Department of Homeland Security talking points have revealed that federal law enforcement officials were directed to make sympathetic comments about Kenosha teen gunman Kyle Rittenhouse if publicly asked about the shootings. </p>

<p>The talking points, obtained by NBC News, were given to Homeland Security officials to prepare them for possible questions from the media after the 17-year-old was charged with shooting dead two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin last month.  </p>

<p>It is not clear if the leaked talking points came from the White House or from Homeland Security's press office. </p>

<p>The emergence of the document came as Rittenhouse's attorneys said they planned to sue Joe Biden and his campaign for libel after the Democratic candidate tweeted a video clip that suggested the teenager is a white supremacist.   </p>

<p>The leaked document, which Homeland Security refused to comment on, suggests that officials point to the fact that Rittenhouse 'took his rifle to the scene of the rioting to help defend small business owners'.</p>

<p>The talking points were given to Homeland Security officials to prepare them for possible questions from the media after Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was charged with shooting dead two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin last month</p>

<p>It also suggests that Rittenhouse was acting in self-defense when he opened fire, which is the main argument the teenager's attorneys have put forward in fighting the charges against him. </p>

<p>'Kyle was seen being chased and attacked by rioters before allegedly shooting three of them, killing two,' the document's talking points say. </p>

<p>'Subsequent video has emerged reportedly showing that there were 'multiple gunmen' involved, which would lend more credence to the self-defense claims.'</p>

<p>The documents also instructed to tell reporters, if asked, that they couldn't comment on pending investigations.</p>

<p>Instead, officials were directed to say: 'What I will say is that Rittenhouse, just like everyone else in America, is innocent until proven guilty and deserves a fair trial based on all the facts, not just the ones that support a certain narrative. This is why we try the accused in the court of law, not the star chamber of public opinion.' </p>

<p>Among the other talking points was a reference for the need to restore law and order.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse, who is from Illinois, is currently fighting extradition to Wisconsin where he is charged with shooting dead two protesters and injuring another. He is pictured during a virtual court hearing in Illinois last week</p>

<p>Homeland's acting deputy secretary, Ken Cuccinelli, did not appear to use the talking points last month when he tweeted that cases like the one involving Rittenhouse were complicated</p>

<p>Attorneys for Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse have announced they plan to sue Joe Biden and his campaign for libel after the presidential candidate tweeted a video suggesting the teenager is a white supremacist.</p>

<p>Lin Wood, who is representing the 17-year-old shooter, said he is taking steps to demand a formal 'public retraction' from the Biden/Harris campaign shortly after the former VP shared the clip. </p>

<p>The 50-second video showed a mashup of scenes from white supremacist rallies and far-right groups across the country as debate moderator Chris Wallace is heard asking Trump if he is willing to condemn the racist organizations. </p>

<p>The clip also includes a shot of Rittenhouse holding a rifle during the Kenosha protests, where is accused of fatally shooting two demonstrators. </p>

<p>'There's no other way to put it: the President of the United States refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night,' Biden said. </p>

<p>Wood tweeted: '[A] formal demand for public retraction is being prepared for Biden/Harris Campaign on behalf of Kyle Rittenhouse. I also hereby demand that [Joe Biden] immediately retract his false accusation that Kyle is a white supremacist &amp; militia member responsible for violence in Kenosha.' </p>

<p>'This is also why we need to stop the violence in our cities. Chaotic and violent situations lead to chaotic, violent and tragic outcomes. Everyone needs law and order,' the document said. </p>

<p>Homeland's acting deputy secretary, Ken Cuccinelli, did not appear to use the talking points last month when he tweeted: 'While as Americans we are naturally antsy and want things concluded quickly, cases like this show the complexities involved in an investigation and why it can take some time to reach conclusions.' </p>

<p>President Donald Trump has previously sympathized with Rittenhouse by saying publicly that the teen appeared to be 'trying to get away' from the protesters he shot dead. </p>

I also hereby demand that [Joe Biden] immediately retract his false accusation that Kyle is a white supremacist &amp; militia member responsible for violence in Kenosha.</p>

<p>'On behalf of Kyle Rittenhouse, I shall sue Joe Biden &amp; Biden/Harris Campaign for libel.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in the killing of two protesters: Joseph Rosenbaum (left) and Anthony Huber (right)</p>

<p>Video shows that Rittenhouse tripped in the street before 26-year-old Anthony Huber hit him with a skateboard and tried to take his rifle away. Rittenhouse opened fire, killing Huber </p>

<p>Rittenhouse then shot and injured Gaige Grosskreutz, who was holding a handgun at the time, as he approached the teenager</p>

<p>'I am partisan in 20/20 supporting [Donald Trump.] I am non-partisan trial lawyer who aggressively pursues truth to achieve justice. Put in your hearing aid, Joe. You will hear footsteps,' he added in a follow-up tweet. </p>

<p>Rittenhouse is charged with first-degree intentional homicide in connection to the deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, during a night of unrest in Kenosha on August 25.</p>

<p>He is also charged with wounding a third demonstrator, Gaige Grosskreutz.</p>

<p>His attorneys have said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense and have portrayed him as a courageous patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during a night of protests over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake.  </p>

<p>Rittenhouse, who was arrested in his hometown of Antioch, participated in a virtual hearing last Friday at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois from the detention facility where he is being held.</p>

<p>Lawyer John Pierce told the judge he planned to fight the request by Kenosha prosecutors that Rittenhouse be transferred to Wisconsin to face charges.</p>

<p>The judge, Paul Novak, gave 14 days for the defense to review papers and file pleadings ahead of an October 9 hearing.</p>

<p>Pierce asked for a month to prepare arguments challenging extradition that he said involve 'issues of some complexity, frankly that have not arisen in the country for some time'.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse's attorneys announced they planned to sue Joe Biden and his campaign for libel after the presidential candidate tweeted a video suggesting the teenager is a white supremacist </p>

<p>Attorney Lin Wood said he is working on demanding a formal public retraction from the Biden/Harris campaign </p>
