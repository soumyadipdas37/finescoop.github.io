<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She turned 54 years young this week and is still every bit the ageless beauty she was when she first came on the scene in Nineties films such as Desperado.</p>

<p>And Salma Hayek continued to reflect back on her earlier years on Thursday when she shared a funny throwback to a magazine shoot she participated in way back in 1996.</p>

<p>It was for Los Angeles Magazine's restaurant issue, and for the cover the Frida star posed in nothing but whipped cream... and 'a cherry on my head'. </p>

<p>Remember when: Salma Hayek reflected back on her earlier years on Thursday, when she shared a funny and enticing throwback to a magazine shoot she participated in back in 1996</p>

<p>Hayek looked like a confection in the image, as she brought one cream-covered finger to her lips while holding a whisk in her other hand. </p>

<p>'In August 1996 I was on the cover of Los Angeles Magazine,' the Oscar nominee explained in one slide of the gallery. </p>

<p>'They were paying homage to Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass album "Whipped Cream &amp; Other Delights" for the Restaurant Issue, so they dressed me up in whipped cream, and even added a cherry on my head.' </p>

<p>Flawless: Salma turned 54 years young this week and is still every bit the ageless beauty she was when she first came on the scene in Nineties films such as Desperado</p>

<p>In the throwback gallery: Hayek explained that the image was for Los Angeles Magazine's restaurant issue, and for the cover the Frida star posed in nothing but whipped cream</p>

<p>In the next slide, however, Hayek pointed out a glaring omission from the cover of the issue.</p>

<p>'Too bad they didn't even mention my name on the cover...' she wrote, next to another image of herself in the whipped cream getup.</p>

<p>And sure enough, while the cover mentions Julia Child, Mario Puzo and 'The biggest movie ever! Starring Bruce, Sly &amp; Arnold', there is no reference whatsoever to the talented actress who graces the page. </p>

<p>To mark the occasion of her actual birthday: Salma posed in a glorious yellow swimsuit and skirt combo in front of a seaside view of Greece on her Instagram on Wednesday </p>

<p>But the day prior, on her actual birthday, there was nothing but positivity and joy on the Fools Rush In star's Instagram.</p>

<p>To mark the occasion, Salma posed in a glorious yellow swimsuit and skirt combo in front of a seaside view of Greece.</p>

<p>'I am very grateful and proud for every single one of my 54 years,' the From Dusk Till Dawn actress wrote in the caption. </p>

<p>'Thank you for all the birthday wishes, especially to my fans who made a special account for my birthday. What a gift! <?php echo e('@'); ?>salmahappybirthday ✨' </p>
