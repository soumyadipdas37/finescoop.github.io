<p>'After eight years together, Tobi and I have come to the difficult decision to separate as a couple. We will always be family, and remain good friends and devoted parents to Arna,' Kayla told her 12.6 million Instagram followers.</p>

<p>'We have grown up together in Adelaide, sharing a lifetime of experiences and special memories from moving into our first apartment and starting SWEAT from our lounge room to becoming parents to our beautiful daughter. </p>

<p>It's over! The Bikini Body Guide founder confirmed her split from Tobi (left) on August 21 </p>

<p>In 2018, Forbes estimated the couple's shared net worth to be $696million.</p>

<p>The couple welcomed their first child together, daughter Arna Leia, in April 2019, just two months after Tobi had surprised Kayla with an engagement party.</p>

<p>After meeting in late 2012, the pair launched the Bikini Body Training Company and went on to amass a following of more than 20 million fitness enthusiasts worldwide thanks to their workouts, app and health books.</p>

<p>They were named joint fifth on the Australian Financial Review's Young Rich List for 2018, making them the wealthiest self-made twentysomethings in Australia.</p>

<p>Their fitness empire helps people to transform their bodies and achieve dramatic weight loss at the gym or from home. </p>

<p>The way they were: The couple welcomed their first child together, daughter Arna Leia, in April 2019, just two months after Tobi had surprised Kayla with an engagement party (pictured) </p>

<p>Kayla started out in the fitness industry when she was left in charge of the Adelaide gym where she worked by an absent manager in the late 2000s.</p>

<p>The then-teenager began honing a program to target the problem areas for women - including abs, arms and thighs - and soon attracted an online following.</p>

<p>She decided to capitalise on her growing fan base in 2012 by building up her profile on social media.</p>

<p>'It was then I decided to build a presence on Instagram and Facebook, in order to share my training and nutrition method,' she wrote on her website. </p>

<p>'By uploading client transformations, healthy eating ideas and some training tips, I was able to inspire thousands of women to move towards a healthier lifestyle and nothing makes me happier.' </p>

<p>She developed her Bikini Body Guide fitness program, which sees women around the world embark on exercise missions and showcase their progress online.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of women worldwide spend $19.99 a month on the program. Itsines and her fiancé Tobi Pearce created the workout and nutritional plan in 2014.</p>

<p>She then created the hugely popular app Sweat With Kayla - which was the most-downloaded fitness app on both iOS and Google Play in 2016 and raked in $17million in revenues.</p>

<p>Her empire also includes paid-for ebooks, a stadium tour and hardcover bestsellers.</p>
