<p>Gabby was asked: 'How did you know you were ready for another relationship after your last one?'</p>

<p>The reality star responded: 'I didn't. It was a slow burner. But this is VERY different to any relationship I've been in before.</p>

<p>'It puts most of my others to shame and I can't believe what I put up with to how well I am respected and how loved I feel now.</p>

<p>'It puts everything into perspective when someone treats you right.'</p>

<p>Confirmed: Gabby recently confirmed and went Instagram official with new boyfriend Brandon after weeks of speculation</p>

<p>In June, Gabby insisted her fellow reality star was a 'really good friend' but nothing more following relationship speculation. </p>

<p>They were first reported to be dating in May, when he posted a flirty comment under one of her scantily-clad bikini snaps.</p>

<p>But the fitness enthusiast insisted they are little more than close friends, telling OK!: 'No. We've known each other for a long time. He's the loveliest person and a really good friend of mine, but that's all it is.</p>

<p>'Someone must have seen him comment on a picture on my social media, and automatically assumed he's my boyfriend.' </p>
