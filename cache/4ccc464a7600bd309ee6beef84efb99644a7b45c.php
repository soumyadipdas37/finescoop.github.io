<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The New Zealand government has designated the Australian man convicted of the Christchurch mosques shootings as a terrorist entity.</p>

<p>The move freezes the assets of Brenton Tarrant, who was given life imprisonment without the possibility of parole at an emotional High Court sentencing last week.</p>

<p>It will also make it a criminal offence to support his activities.</p>

<p>Brenton Tarrant has been designated as a terrorist entity in New Zealand</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was the first time New Zealand had added an individual to the list.</p>

<p>'Designating the offender is an important demonstration of New Zealand's condemnation of terrorism and violent extremism in all forms,' she said.</p>

<p>'This designation ensures the offender cannot be involved in the financing of terrorism in the future.</p>

<p>'We have an obligation to New Zealand and to the wider international community to prevent the financing of terrorist acts.'</p>

<p>Tarrant joins 19 other entries - including Islamic State, Al-Shabaab and other terrorist movements - on the designated list.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern said her government was open to designating further right-wing extemists of Tarrant's ilk.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said it was the first time New Zealand had added an individual to the list</p>

<p>The Labour leader has also confirmed her decision to meet with Tarrant's surviving victims to discover their views on whether she should seek the 29-year-old's repatriation across the Tasman to serve his punishment in an Australian jail.</p>

<p>Australian PM Scott Morrison has left the door open for this move.</p>

<p>'We both understand that there is currently no basis at law for it,' she said.</p>

<p>'I would like to talk to the families before taking a particular stance on the issue.'</p>
