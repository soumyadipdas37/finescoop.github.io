<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the moment a couple were caught on camera fleeing a Greek restaurant without paying after racking up a £100 bill on cocktails and expensive steaks. </p>

<p>CCTV cameras caught the young couple as they ran out of the My Big Fat Greek Taverna eatery, in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, last Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>They had indulged in a slap-up dinner before acting 'shady' when time came to foot the bill. And when general manager Vicky Hart approached them and politely asked for payment, they got up and sprinted off. </p>

<p>CCTV cameras caught the young couple as they ran out of the My Big Fat Greek Taverna eatery, in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, last Wednesday evening</p>

<p>Jason Smedley, who owns My Big Fat Greek Eatery, as well as the Royal Hotel complex in which the restaurant is situated, said he was left 'fuming' when he heard of the getaway.</p>

<p>The 50-year-old, who took over ownership of the Royal Hotel complex a year ago, said: 'It is very annoying.</p>

<p>'Everyone is struggling at the moment - but it's unfortunate the couple felt they had to do this, especially after we had put on the Eat Out To Help Out scheme last month to try and ease things a bit.</p>

<p>'I think they were probably out-of-towners who tried their luck knowing they wouldn't get caught.</p>

<p>'Our general manager Vicky tried to chase after them, and they were yelling all sorts at her, telling her to "eff off". </p>

<p>'It's not what you'd expect from a sunny Wednesday evening in Clacton.'</p>

<p>The pair - pictured - had indulged in a slap-up dinner before acting 'shady' when time came to foot the bill</p>

<p>Mr Smedley added that the couple had allegedly been spotted in the Wetherspoons pub next door, before popping in to My Big Fat Greek Taverna to enjoy their meal.</p>

<p>Restaurant owner Jason Smedley said he was left 'fuming' when he heard of the getaway</p>

<p>And he said: 'It is very frustrating, because when the hotel was forced to close due to coronavirus, we used it for three months to house NHS staff and ambulance workers.</p>

<p>'That was at a massive cost to us - so we're trying to re-coup some of that money at the moment.'</p>

<p>And the restaurant's general manager, Vicky Hart, who gave chase when the couple bolted, added: 'They had eight cocktails between them and two T-bone steaks, totalling £100. But then they ran off straight after eating.</p>

<p>'It is so frustrating given the circumstances because we and so many other restaurants have worked so hard to get the business back up and running since coronavirus.</p>

<p>'So, to then have people go against all our hard work is sad. But we now have new business measures in place to ensure this does not happen again.'</p>

<p>The couple were at a nearby Wetherspoons before visiting the My Big Fat Greek Taverna to enjoy their meal</p>
