<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A stretch of the iconic White Cliffs of Dover is being offered for sale for a bargain price of £55,000.</p>

<p>The 17.3 acre plot of land is positioned right at the top of the legendary landmark with stunning views across the English Channel to France.</p>

<p>The cliffs initially shot to public fame after Vera Lynn's famous 1942 war-time recording of the song of the same name. </p>

<p>The chalk cliffs (above) themselves are owned by the National Trust which is not for sale.  The land currently up for sale is positioned at the top</p>

<p>Last week a humanitarian charity controversially used them to beam messages on to welcoming refugees to Britain.</p>

<p>The chalk cliffs themselves are owned by the National Trust, with the land currently up for sale positioned at the top, next to the Folkestone Warren Country Park.</p>

<p>And as the plot is heavily protected - it forms part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation - it would be impossible for the new owner to develop it.  </p>

<p>Countdown to bidding: The iconic White Cliffs of Dover are up for sale for just £50,000 but perspective buyers won't be able to build on the land</p>

<p>But they would be able to boast that they own their own piece of history at one of the most famous landmarks in the country.</p>

<p>The land in question is home to a variety of interesting wildlife - although there are sadly no bluebirds as mentioned by the Forces' Sweetheart in her song.</p>

<p>It is up for sale with property specialists Clive Emson auctioneers of Maidstone, Kent.</p>

<p>They have given it a freehold guide price of between £45,000 and £55,000.</p>

<p>Jon Rimmer, auction appraiser, said: "This is a fantastic opportunity for someone to own part of the iconic cliffs </p>

<p>The sprawling 17.9 acres is bustling with wildlife such as the Adonis blue butterfly, chalkhill blues, the red admiral, painted lady and yellow clouded butterfly</p>

<p>"There is a variety of wildlife on the land - but no bluebirds which are a north American species.</p>

<p>"The wartime song had a new lease of life earlier this year following the death of Vera Lynn who was 103.</p>

<p>"Her 1942 recording was one of the country's favourite songs during Word War Two and has remained part of our musical culture ever since.</p>

<p>"It is being offered with a freehold guide price of £45,000-55,000. </p>

<p>The chalk cliffs stand at 350ft at their tallest point and can be seen from France on a clear day.</p>

<p>Buyers wishing to snap up this part of British history are being urged to visit the area in daylight hours to enjoy the very best of the spectacular views</p>

<p>During the Second World War, when Dame Vera Lynn recorded her track, they were home to large gun batteries positioned along the coast.</p>

<p>Although quickly constructed and only fired sparingly, the guns were an important aspect of the defence of Britain.</p>

<p>The sale takes place on September 23.</p>
