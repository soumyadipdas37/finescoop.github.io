<p>Socialite Christina Oxenberg, 57, is the daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, a second cousin of Prince Charles. She has recently made headlines by speaking out on her old acquaintance Ghislaine Maxwell. </p>

<p>Writing in Tatler, Christina, who was born in the US, said the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are celebrated by the American public, who are 'charmed' to have their own 'real life princess'. </p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have a bright future in the US because Americans are 'easy to please', a royal cousin has claimed. Pictured, Harry and Meghan in Morocco last year</p>

<p>'Possibly too much is expected by the Brits from England's one-time most eligible bachelor and his actress wife,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'To be adored in America, all Harry and Meghan need to do is pick up a dog from a shelter. Americans are easy to please. What draws scorn in England will be applauded in the States.' </p>

<p>She added that the press coverage will be 'positive rather than petulant' and that American journalists are likely to treat the couple 'very well'. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made a number of appearances since moving to California, where they are living in a Santa Barbara mansion.   </p>

<p>Most recently Meghan spoke at the Fortune's Most Powerful Women summit, where she said she pays no mind to public 'flattery or criticism' about her and hit out at the media for 'misinterpreting' remarks she has made in order to make them sound more 'controversial' or 'inflammatory'. </p>

<p>Despite insisting that she does not focus on anything said or written about her, Meghan defended herself against past controversies, alleging that any time 'anything she has said... ends up being inflammatory', it only comes a result of 'people's interpretation of it'. </p>

<p>Socialite Christina Oxenberg, 57, is the daughter of Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia, a second cousin of Prince Charles. She has spoken about Harry and Meghan's future in the US </p>

<p>'If you listen to what I actually say, it's not controversial,' she added.</p>

<p>'I have already settled it for myself so flattery and criticism go down the same drain and I am quite free,' she quoted, while adding her own sentiments, claiming that she feels 'liberated' from opinions about her. </p>

<p>'And the moment you are able to be liberated from all these other opinions of what you know to be true, then I think it’s just very easy to just live with peace and live with authenticity,' she said. 'And that is how I choose to move through the world.' </p>

<p>The words are at odds with Meghan and Prince Harry's ongoing war against the media, which has seen the Duchess of Sussex repeatedly decry the 'toxicity' that she believes the couple has faced.  </p>

<p>Earlier this year Christina made headlines when she spoke out in defence of scandal-hit Prince Andrew, who is also a cousin. </p>

<p>She said Andrew did not know he was being 'used' by Jeffrey Epstein and she hopes he will help investigators with their probe into the deceased American billionaire. </p>

<p>'He did idiotic things,' Ms Oxenberg said in an interview with Fox News. 'But he's not a paedophile. He's not a sex ring organizer. </p>

<p>'I'm sure he's filled with regret and remorse. He loves his family. He's duty-bound. He loves his mother and doesn't want to bring her grief.' </p>
