<p>An article about convicted paedophile Derek Slade was published on 11 September 2010. Derek Sawyer, the former chairman of the London Regional Courts Board, has complained that it falsely alleged that he knew Slade was committing crimes against children and protecting him. We did not intend to make this allegation and are happy to make this clear.</p>
