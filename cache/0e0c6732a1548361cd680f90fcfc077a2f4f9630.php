<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents and students at a high school in Dallas are outraged after a school assignment listed Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse as a 'hero for the modern age'.</p>

<p>Among the list of heroes alongside Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old who shot and killed two Black Lives Matters protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last month, were activist Malcolm X and Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<p>Also on the list were George Floyd, Cesar Chavez and Joseph Rosenbaum - one of the two men Rittenhouse gunned down. </p>

<p>The assignment was given to seniors in an English class at W.T. White High School in Dallas, Texas, and had two parts; first asking students to write a biography for the six people listed and then asking them to write a one-page essay on which of those six people they believed best demonstrated the concept of a hero. </p>

<p>Among the list of heroes alongside Rittenhouse, the 17-year-old who shot and killed two Black Lives Matters protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last month, were activist Malcolm X and Mahatma Gandhi</p>

<p>The assignment was posted on Google Classrooms with the names of Gandhi and Malcolm X misspelled. </p>

<p>It sparked criticism among students and parents, with the older sister of one student in the class telling NBC Dallas she questioned the integrity of the assignment. </p>

<p>Joseph Rosenbaum - one of the two men Rittenhouse gunned down - was also on the list</p>

<p>'It was just like, ''Oh my gosh, the spelling, Oh my gosh, there are no women on here,'' and then very ardently the fact that a White supremacist murderer's name is on a list with important historical figures,' said Kristian Hernandez. </p>

<p>'The juxtaposition of George Floyd's name with Kyle's name was just astounding,' she added. 'The value of Black lives are not up for debate, and that's what it felt like this was sort of getting at — by way of the names that were included.'</p>

<p>Hernandez added that her brother was in 'disbelief' at the assignment. </p>

<p>According data from Dallas ISD for the 2019-2020 school year, the students of W.T. White High School are 81percent Hispanic and 10percent African American.</p>

<p>The Dallas Independent School District apologized for the assignment and said it had not been approved.</p>

<p>'Racial equity is a top priority in Dallas ISD, and we remain committed to providing a robust teaching environment where all students can learn,' the district said in a statement to CNN. 'It is important that we continue to be culturally sensitive to our diverse populations and provide a space of respect and value.' </p>

<p>Robyn Harris, director of news and information for Dallas ISD, said the assignment has been removed from Google Classroom and students are not required to complete it.  </p>

<p>The teacher who created the assignment has not been identified, but the district said it is taking the 'appropriate steps' moving forward.     </p>

<p>'We absolutely take these incidents seriously and even though these are personal matters, we are absolutely making sure that the proper and appropriate measures are being taken,' Harris said.</p>

<p>Rittenhouse faces five felony charges including first-degree murder.  He shot one of his victims five times including in the head, the criminal complaint reveals. </p>
