<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho has extended an olive branch to Dele Alli by hinting he may be involved in Thursday night's Europa League play-off.</p>

<p>Alli was left out of the Tottenham squads for the recent matches against Southampton and Newcastle United in the Premier League, then Tuesday night's Carabao Cup game with Chelsea.</p>

<p>The England midfielder has been linked with a move away from the north London club before the summer transfer window closes on Monday night.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has hinted that Dele Alli may return to the Tottenham side on Thursday night</p>

<p>Mourinho appears to have softened his tone after leaving Alli out of three squads recently</p>

<p>But Mourinho has suggested Alli could be involved in Thursday's fixture against Israeli side Maccabi Haifa.</p>

<p>He said: 'I cannot confirm Dele's playing tomorrow but I cannot confirm he's not playing. We have still training sessions today, we have still decisions to make.</p>

<p>'The only thing I can say is he's being very, very professional. I have only respect for him. He's being very professional, particularly yesterday when the team was preparing for the game and he wasn't.</p>

<p>'It would be perfectly acceptable to have a lack of motivation, even a lack of professionalism for this training session, but it was exactly the opposite.Â </p>

<p>Alli played in the Europa League against Shkendija last week and could be involved again</p>

<p>Tottenham celebrate their Carabao Cup penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea on Tuesday night</p>

<p>'He trained very hard yesterday. He has my respect and the respect of his team-mates so it's possible he plays tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Mourinho is certain to rotate his squad as they prepare to take the field again just 48 hours after their penalty shoot-out win over Chelsea.</p>

<p>Alli, 24, started Tottenham's opening league fixture of the season against Everton but was withdrawn for Moussa Sissoko at half-time.</p>

<p>He also started last Thursday's Europa League qualifier against Shkendija in North Macedonia, completing an hour of the 3-1 win.</p>

<p>Alli has been linked with a season-long loan move to Paris Saint-Germain but the two clubs would have to trash out a deal quickly with just five days of the window left.</p>
