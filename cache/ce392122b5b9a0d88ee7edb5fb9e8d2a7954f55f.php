<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Native Americans make up a larger percentage of novel coronavirus cases than compared to their share of the US population, a new report finds.</p>

<p>American Indians and Alaska Natives account for 0.7 percent of the population but at 1.3 percent of all COVID-19 cases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) revealed on Wednesday. </p>

<p>What's more, indigenous people are 3.5 times more likely to contact the virus than Caucasian Americans. </p>

<p>Infections tended to be more common among those aged 18 and younger and not in those above age 65 as seen in the white population.</p>

<p>A higher percentage of indigenous people under age 18 were infected at 12.9% compared to 4.3% among whites. Pictured: A sign warning non-residents to stay out of the Navajo Nation town of Tuba City during the 57-hour curfew in Arizona, May 24</p>

<p>Recent studies have found that Native Americans and Alaska Natives are among the groups at highest risk for contracting severe cases of COVID-19. </p>

<p>Racial and social inequities between these communities and white populations have adversely affected tribal nations.</p>

<p>Additionally, this population tends to rely on shared transpiration, live among large groups of people in close quarters, and had limited access to running water.</p>

<p>For the report, the CDC looked at the prevalence of coronavirus among Native Americans in 23 states between January 22 and July 3.</p>

<p>These states include Alabama, Alaska, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Utah, Wisconsin and Wyoming. </p>

<p>Results showed that while white Americans made up a larger total number of cases, a higher percentage of the indigenous population was infected.</p>

<p>In fact, Natives were 3.5 times more likely to fall ill with COVID-19 than Caucasians. </p>

<p>A higher proportion of Native Americans 18-year-old or younger tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 than those who were white and in the same age range at 12.9 percent and 4.3 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>However, a smaller percentage of cases were among Natives aged 65 year or older at 12.6 percent compared to 28.6 percent among this age group for whites. </p>

<p>Because there was incomplete data regarding symptoms, underlying health conditions, hospitalization and/or ICU status, comparisons between Natives and whites could not be made.  </p>

<p>Recently, the CDC announced it was proving Indian country with more than $200 million to fight COVID-19.</p>

<p>The funds will help tribal leaders conduct testing, contact tracing, infection control and mitigation.  </p>

<p>'American Indian and Alaska Native people have suffered a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 illness during the pandemic,' said CDC director Dr Robert Redfield in a statement.</p>

<p>'This funding approach will broaden access to COVID-19 resources across tribal communities.'</p>

<p>The CDC said it will continue to provide tribal nations with resources on managing physical health, affordable testing and access to mental health care. </p>

<p>'Funding is only one step in addressing the impact of COVID-19 on tribal communities,' said Dr José Montero, director of the CDC's Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Support. </p>

<p>'CDC is continuing to work on coordinated outreach to tribal nations through our Office of Tribal Affairs and Strategic Alliances and new Tribal Support Section to provide remote- and field-based support to our hardest hit tribal communities.'  </p>
