<p>The Labour leader announced he is going into self-isolation hours after taking a phone-in in the LBC radio studios. The party has informed the radio station about the situation. </p>

<p>A Labour spokesman said: 'This morning Keir Starmer was advised to self isolate after a member of his household showed possible symptoms of the coronavirus. The member of his household has now had a test. </p>

<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer announced he is going into self-isolation hours after taking a phone-in in the LBC radio studios</p>

<p>'In line with NHS guidelines, Keir will self-isolate while awaiting the results of the test and further advice from medical professionals.'</p>

<p>It is understood Sir Keir has not shown any signs of the disease himself, but will not be speaking in the Commons debate on Brexit later.</p>

<p>During the phone-in, Sir Keir said he supported the Government's new 'Rule of Six' restrictions which came into force today.</p>

<p>He said: 'I do support the 'rule of six'.</p>

<p>'I think you need something simple, easily understood and I think the Government was slow back in February and March to appreciate the problem it was about the face and we can't repeat that error again, so I do support the 'rule of six'.</p>

<p>'We've publicly come out in support of it and I will say, as I said to the Prime Minister I would, as the leader of the Opposition I say to everybody, please follow the Government advice, please follow these rules.'</p>

<p>He added: 'You can make the argument of why not five or why not six or seven – you have to go with a number backed by the science and they say six and I think we should abide by that rule.'</p>

<p>Sir Keir said ministers' 'side of the bargain' was to improve NHS Test and Trace and to ensure more people were self-isolating now that fresh social restrictions had been put in place.</p>
