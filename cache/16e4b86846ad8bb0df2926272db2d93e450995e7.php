<p>But ten-year-old Harrison Walmsley tried not to panic when he saw his sister Eva, six, choking on a Lego brick.</p>

<p>Instead he recalled a first-aid technique he learned at school before lockdown – and carried out the Heimlich manoeuvre.</p>

<p>Ten-year-old Harrison Walmsley (left) tried not to panic when he saw his sister Eva, six, (right) choking on a Lego brick</p>

<p>He grabbed Eva from behind and squeezed her abdomen until she was able to spit out the brick – saving her life. </p>

<p>The quick-thinking schoolboy leapt into action after Eva burst into his bedroom going red in the face.</p>

<p>By the time their horrified parents arrived minutes later she was able to breathe again. </p>

<p>Harrison recalled a first-aid technique he learned at school before lockdown – and carried out the Heimlich manoeuvre</p>

<p>Now Harrison has been hailed a hero – and his parents have told him that Father Christmas is going to be extra-generous this year.</p>

<p>His father Brian said: 'It was a split-second decision that saved her life – I'm bursting with pride with how Harrison acted.</p>

<p>'He's amazingly calm and managed to think about what he needed to do without panicking.'</p>

<p>The children were playing in their rooms at their home in Blackburn, when Harrison began shouting: 'Mum! Dad! Quick, Eva is choking!' </p>

<p>Harrison said: 'It was terrifying when I had to put the knowledge I'd learned into action but I'm happy I was able to do it. I just wanted Eva to be all right and be safe.' </p>

<p>By performing abdominal thrusts, Harrison was able to clear the plastic brick from her throat and enable her to breathe again by the time her parents reached his room.</p>

<p>He added: 'I knew what I needed to do. She was choking and I had to act.' </p>

<p>Mr Walmsley, 37, said it could have easily ended in tragedy. </p>

<p>'She was completely red in the face and crying – it was terrifying. She was shaking and crying and he was just so flustered – it was just such a big commotion.</p>

<p>'We checked if she was OK and it was clear she wasn't choking any more but we took her to the hospital anyway. </p>

<p>Thankfully everything was all right and the worst was behind us. </p>

<p>But in that moment it was just terrifying – seeing your child like that is every parent's worst nightmare.' </p>

<p>The quick-thinking schoolboy leapt into action after his sister burst into his bedroom going red in the face</p>

<p>Harrison learned about the life-saving technique at his school in nearby Osbaldeston shortly before pupils were sent home at the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>His father said: 'I'm so grateful. It's so easy for a kid to choke and it's something that can just happen in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>'But it's fantastic that the school commissioned the first-aid training and even more remarkable that Harrison remembered it all these months on. </p>

<p>'It's so important to learn how to do these things as you can't predict when something like this will happen – you just need to be ready.'</p>

<p>Harrison's headteacher at St Mary's School, Maria Coulthard, said: 'Harrison's quick-thinking and ability to remain calm in a potentially life-threatening situation by putting into practice what he'd learned in school has made myself and the whole school community so proud.'</p>
