<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Finger prick antibody testing kits for detecting coronavirus 'are as accurate as sophisticated lab analysis' and have a 98 per cent accuracy race, a new study found.</p>

<p>Researchers from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London examined a range of antibody tests as part of the study. </p>

<p>All of the commercial testing kits could tell if someone has or already had Covid-19 but they vary in terms of their performance in terms of overall accuracy.</p>

<p>All the tests examined by the team had a 95 per cent accuracy more than 20 days after coronavirus symptoms had shown - but performance varied before that point. </p>

<p>Antibody tests made by Accu-Tell, SureScreen and Spring came out top as they are able to provide accurate results within 20 days of symptoms appearing.</p>

<p>Co-author Jonathan Edgeworth said: 'We found that some of the quick single-use kits are as accurate as our sophisticated laboratory technologies.' </p>

<p>Antibody tests made by Accu-Tell, SureScreen and Spring came out top as they are able to provide accurate results within 20 days of symptoms appearing</p>

<p>The team created a 'rigorous comparison' system that would allow doctors to more easily determine the best option for their hospital. </p>

<p>Unlike the throat and nose swab tests designed to say if someone is currently infected with the virus, antibody tests can tell if someone has had the virus.  </p>

<p>For diagnosis later in disease, or in delayed-onset syndromes, antibody tests could form an important part of hospital diagnostic capabilities, authors say.</p>

<p>In the study the researchers developed a sensitive and specific antibody testing system and used it to conduct an unbiased comparison of the ten top testing kits.</p>

<p>They put the kits against each other in a head-to-head examination involving identical blood samples from patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19.</p>

<p>They then compared those tests to 50 pre-pandemic negative blood samples.  </p>

<p>There was a broad range of performances among the tests, with the ability to identify those with the disease ranging from 82 per cent success to 100 per cent.  </p>

<p>All gave the best results when used 20 days or more after the start of symptoms, with most tests reaching a sensitivity value greater than 95 per cent. </p>

<p>Unlike the throat and nose swab tests designed to say if someone is currently infected with the virus, antibody tests can tell if someone has had the virus</p>

<p>In addition, antibody levels were higher in individuals with severe illness compared to those with asymptomatic or mild disease. </p>

<p>When all commercial tests were compared, Accu-Tell, SureScreen and Spring demonstrated highest sensitivity at earlier time points, while maintaining a success rate in detecting the virus of 98 per cent or above. </p>

<p>These are 'affordable, quick and easy to use, according to the team, who say if deployed appropriately they could be useful in healthcare settings. </p>

<p>'Encouraged by these findings we are piloting them in the hospital to give doctors a quick reliable answer in a range of clinical settings,' said Edgeworth. </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal PLOS Pathogens. </p>

<p>Simple blood tests for coronavirus, like Premier Biotech's, work much like pregnancy tests. </p>

<p>After the sample of blood is collected, a technician injects it into the analysis device - which is about the size of an Apple TV or Roku remote - along with some buffer, and waits about 10 minutes. </p>

<p>The blood droplet and buffer soak into the absorbent strip of paper enclosed in the plastic collection device. </p>

<p>Blood naturally seeps along the strip, which is dyed at three points: one for each of two types of antibodies, and a third control line. </p>

<p>The strip is marked 'IgM' and 'IgG', for immunoglobulins M and G. Each of these are types of antibodies that the body produces in response to a late- or early-stage infection. </p>

<p>Along each strip, the antibodies themselves are printed in combination with gold, which react when the either the antigen - or pathogen, in this case, the virus that causes COVID-19 - or the antibody to fight are present.</p>

<p>Results are displayed in a similar fashion to those of an at-home pregnancy test. </p>

<p>One line - the top, control strip - means negative. </p>

<p>Two lines - the top control line and the bottom IgM line - in a spread-out configuration means the sample contains antibodies that the body starts making shortly after infection. </p>

<p>Two lines closer - control and IgG - together mean the person is positive for the later-stage antibodies. </p>

<p>Three lines mean the patient is positive for both types of antibodies. </p>
