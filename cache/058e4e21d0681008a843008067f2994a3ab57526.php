<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Vacuuming can feel like a never ending chore, especially if you have a dog or cat that sheds a lot of pet hair. The task can also be pretty exhausting if you own a heavy vacuum cleaner.</p>

<p>Enter the new Roborock S6 vacuum cleaner, which takes all the hassle out of keeping your floors clean and banishes dust, dirt and pet hair. You no longer need to lug a standard vacuum around your house or get tangled in wires to have a clean home.</p>

<p>Not only can it mop and vacuum at the same time, but you can program dates and times for the device to clean whenever you want, meaning you can go about your day without the worry of cleaning.</p>

<p>To cut to the chase, the vacuum cleaner has a pretty hefty price tag of £530 on Amazon, which might be enough to put anyone off. But if you're looking for a precise and powerful cleaning gadget that doesn't miss spots, then this might be worth the splurge.</p>

<p>While there are robot vacuum cleaners available for a fraction of the price, it's fair to say the Roborock S6 comes equipped with all the bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Using intelligent navigation with a high-precision laser and a powerful quad-core processor, this robot vacuum cleaner calculates the fastest and most convenient route to clean your home quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>The robot vacuum cleaner uses 14 sensors to create a 360 degree view of your floor space and detects walls and obstructions, such as furniture and other common household items. Once the Roborock S6 has mapped out your home, it will dodge these objects with ease during future clean-ups. </p>

<p>Its large lithium-ion battery allows for three hours of continuous cleaning, and when cleaning is completed, the Roborock S6 takes itself back to its docking station to self-charge. During my test, it was able to fully clean 20 square metres in under 25 minutes and only used about 5 per cent of the battery. </p>

<p>Performance is very quiet compared to a traditional vacuum cleaner, meaning you could schedule the device to clean certain rooms during the night without disturbing anyone's sleep. </p>

<p>If you have pets, the vacuum's camera functions allow the Roborock S6 to clean around them. It will also automatically detect floor types and switch modes to tackle carpets and hard floors.</p>

<p>The mop mode reduces cleaning time and leaves your floors shining. However you cannot put any cleaning fluid inside the device, meaning you might want to use a regular mop and bucket on occasion for a deeper clean. </p>

<p>The robot vacuum cleaner is easy to set up via the Roborock app on your smartphone and connects to your home Wi-Fi for system updates. </p>

<p>You can customise the vacuum's cleaning modes and schedule, as well as what rooms you want it to clean. You can even guide the vacuum cleaner in remote control mode.</p>

<p>The app also lets you check the condition of your device, and notifies you when the filter and brushes need replacing.</p>
