<p>Sadie Frost  2 September 1997 - 29 October 2003</p>

<p>Three children - son Rafferty, 23, daughter Iris, 19, and son Rudy, 17</p>

<p>The couple met on the set of film Shopping. In what was his first major role, Jude was just 19. Sadie was a 25-year-old married mother-of-one.</p>

<p>Sadie Frost (pictured in 1996)</p>

<p>She divorced her husband, Spandau Ballet's Gary Kemp, in 1995.</p>

<p>Jude and Sadie subsequently married and have three children. In her 2010 autobiography, Crazy Days, Sadie said: 'The force of the love I felt for Jude and his intense ambition made me feel out of control'. </p>

<p>Sadie late revealed her struggle with post-natal depression was a contributing factor to her divorce from the actor. </p>

<p>She wrote in her book: 'The more I worried about my condition, the more self-obsessed I became and the less attention I gave to Jude'.</p>

<p>Sienna Miller 2004 - February 2006</p>

<p>Jude was 30 when he broke up with Sadie. Following their 2003 divorce, he met Sienna Miller while filming Alfie, in which he played the titular role. </p>

<p>Sienna Miller (pictured in 2004)</p>

<p>Their high-profile romance came crashing down when it was revealed he had an affair with their kids' nanny Daisy Wright. </p>

<p>In his public apology to Sienna, he said: 'Following the reports in today's papers, I just want to say I am deeply ashamed and upset that I've hurt Sienna and the people most close to us. </p>

<p>'I want to publicly apologise to Sienna and our respective families for the pain that I have caused. There is no defence for my actions which I sincerely regret and I ask that you respect our privacy at this very difficult time.' </p>

<p>Daisy Wright 2006</p>

<p>Daisy was hired by Sadie and Jude in August 2004 to be a weekend nanny for their children. </p>

<p>She later revealed they had embarked on an affair while he was still in a relationship with Sienna and sold her story with many tawdry details - including one of his kids walking in on them in bed. </p>

<p>Daisy later admitted she regretted selling a kiss and tell on the star. The story was engineered by disgraced late publicist Max Clifford - who was famed for orchestrating kiss and tells to make the subject famous.  </p>

<p>After the affair was revealed, Sienna is said to have told an interviewer: 'Daisy better live in fear. </p>

<p>'I'm looking forward to the day when our paths will cross, which I know they will. I just hope that woman doesn't run into me in a dark alley!' </p>

<p>Speaking about Sophia, Samantha said: 'She has Jude’s chin and nose, and she does a little pout, that I notice he’s done before... There are no plans for [Jude to visit] at the moment, but I know he’s busy.'</p>

<p>On their relationship, she said: 'I ran into Jude in a nightclub one night. </p>

<p>'I instantly knew who he was, but he seemed really funny; he was cracking jokes with people and he included me in that. </p>

<p>'The next thing I knew I was on the pavement outside, being twirled around – it was a lot of fun. </p>

<p>'Following that initial meeting, Jude and I went out several times. He was a lot of fun to be around, always making me laugh and smile.' </p>

<p>Catherine Harding 2014</p>

<p>She recently competed on The Voice. Ada was born after a brief romance and they had already split when they announced the pregnancy.</p>

<p>After the birth, she said: 'She looks like Jude massively, she doesn’t look like me. Jude is really funny and sweet. I remember last week he came over and he had to change her on the park bench. He cleaned her all up.</p>

<p>He is a good dad and she sees her brothers and sisters. He takes her out all the time. </p>

<p>'The birth was really painful, I only wanted my mum there, it was a C-section, it was really horrible. But he came straight after and was really amazing.'</p>

<p>The Talented Mr Ripley actor said: ‘I love it, so absolutely why not? I’m very lucky to be involved with someone I’m madly in love with...</p>
