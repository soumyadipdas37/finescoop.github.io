<p>Love of my life: Lea Michele uploaded a sweet snapshot to her Instagram this Wednesday and wrote in the caption: 'These moments'</p>

<p>The Broadway veteran's eyes were almost closed as she basked in her blissful moment with her new little pride and joy.</p>

<p>She married Zandy in Napa last March, and they announced in early May this year that she had become pregnant.</p>

<p>However she was hit with tragic news during her pregnancy when her onetime Glee co-star Naya Rivera died in a heartbreaking drowning accident.</p>

<p>Love of her life: She and her new husband Zandy Reich welcomed their firstborn son into the world on August 20 about four weeks ago; the couple are pictured last March</p>

<p>Naya had gone boating on Lake Piru with her four-year-old son Josey, whom she managed to save and who will live with his father Ryan Dorsey.</p>

<p>After it was confirmed that Naya had died Lea posted a tribute to both her and their late fellow co-star Corey Monteith.</p>

<p>Lea and Corey were love interests both on the show and in real life, and were a couple when he died aged 31 in 2013 of an alcohol and heroin overdose. </p>

<p>New role: Lea recently showed off a new necklace she got that reads: 'mama'</p>

<p>She was also hit with crisis this June when Glee alum Samantha Ware accused her of making 'my first television gig a living hell' when they worked together.</p>

<p>Former co-stars including Amber Riley and Heather Morris also said she was difficult to work with and Hello Fresh ended its partnership with Lea. </p>

<p>Lea released a contrite statement saying: 'Whether it was my privileged position and perspective that caused me to be perceived as insensitive or inappropriate at times or whether it was just my immaturity and me just being unnecessarily difficult, I apologize for my behavior and for any pain which I have caused.' </p>
