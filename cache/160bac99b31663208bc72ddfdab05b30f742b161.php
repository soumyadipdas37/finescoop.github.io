<p>Crowds who braved extreme weather conditions in Perth, Australia were treated to a doubly dazzling display in the skies above the city.</p>

<p>An estimated 250,000 people turned out to watch the 28th annual Australia Day fireworks display in the western Australian city, despite fears weather conditions could disrupt the event.</p>

<p>The sky was lit up not only by fireworks but with spectacular flashes of lightning which occured in tandem with the organised displays.</p>

<p>High temperatures during the day and the threat of a huge thunderstorm in the evening had threatened to keep spectators away.</p>

<p>But, though numbers were down on last year's event, crowds flocked to the Esplanade, the South Perth foreshore and Kings Park to see this year's fireworks.</p>

<p>For those who did brave the conditions, the reward was spectacular.</p>

<p>One reveller said the display was 'absolutely fantastic, worth getting wet for'.</p>
