<p>Jake also finds it funny that his character on Channel Seven's soap Home and Away helped prepare him for his role as a real-life father.</p>

<p>'I kind of laugh at Robbo's storyline, because as I was sort of leaving the show he was becoming a father and I got a great crash course on how to deal with babies for the last eight weeks that I was there,' he said.</p>

<p>Alice and Jake announced they were expecting in May last year, the same month Jake was spotted filming scenes with a baby on the soap with on-screen wife, played by Bachelor star Sam Frost.</p>
