<p>They are best known for their ‘once you pop you can’t stop’ slogan.</p>

<p>But the Pringles tube and lid which makes for the distinctive sound could be in for a change. </p>

<p>The container is being redesigned after criticism that it was too difficult to recycle.</p>

<p>Its current metal base, plastic cap, metal tear-off lid and foil-lined cardboard sleeve make it the ‘number one recycling villain’ according to the Recycling Association.</p>

<p>Now Kellogg’s, which makes the snack, is testing out simpler cans in an attempt to make them more eco-friendly.</p>

<p>The new cans are made from around 90 per cent paper, one with a recyclable plastic lid and the other a paper lid, pictured, and are being trialled in some Tesco stores.</p>

<p>Kellogg’s said they will still produce the ‘pop’ – but experts say more needs to be done to improve the design. In 2017 Simon Ellin, chief executive of the Recycling Association, highlighted the difficulties surrounding Pringles packaging.</p>

<p>He has welcomed the new can – but said it’s not a full solution.</p>

<p>‘This new Pringles tube that is being trialled is a big improvement on its predecessor as it is much easier to recycle,’ he said. </p>

<p>‘However, we have always maintained that it is easier to recycle packaging based on as few materials as possible.’</p>

<p>A Kellogg’s spokesman said: ‘As part of the trial we will get feedback so we can create the best Pringles can of the future.’ </p>

<p>The other 10 per cent of the new can is a polyal – a type of plastic – barrier that protects against oxygen and moisture.</p>

<p>The polyal-coated card will need to be tested to see if it is recyclable.</p>
