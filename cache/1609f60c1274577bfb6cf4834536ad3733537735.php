<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pair of $22 Kmart trousers are flying out of stock after being worn by one of Australia's top stylists - and they look almost identical to a designer pair more than 63 times the price.</p>

<p>Canberra fashion blogger 'This is Genevieve' sparked the rush by sharing a series of outfit photos on Instagram featuring the discount store's beige coloured 'Tapered Leg Pants'.Â </p>

<p>The pants - which come in beige and black and are available in sizes six to 20 - sit high on the waist and hang loose in a flattering cut that can be cuffed at the ankles, creating the illusion of longer legs.</p>

<p>They are remarkably similar to $1,390 high-waisted trousers from Bottega Veneta, an Italian fashion house known for its luxury leathers and tailoring.</p>

<p>Spot the difference: Kmart's $22 Tapered Leg Pants (left) bear striking similarity to a pair of $1,390 high-waisted tailored trousers from luxury fashion house, Bottega Veneta (right)</p>

<p>Both styles fasten at the waist with a hook and eye detail and have large belt loops, big enough to slide even the thickest accessories through.</p>

<p>Genevieve's followers couldn't believe the pants had come from the famously affordable retailer, with many noting the likeness to expensive pieces from designer labels.</p>

<p>Similar styles cost $109 from streetwear brand Stussy, $79 from Dickies and $99 from Australian e-commerce label Lioness.</p>

<p>'No WAY these are Kmart - I want!' one woman replied.</p>

<p>Another said the post had inspired her to buy beige trousers for the first time in years after almost a decade of shunning them for black.</p>

<p>Other gushing responses included 'wow, these are gorgeous', 'amazing!' and 'love'.</p>

<p>And it's not the first pair of low-priced Kmart trousers that have captured the imagination of Australian fashionistas this month.</p>

<p>Sydney fashion blogger Angel Perez, who posts on Instagram as 'Styling Mum and Bub', caught followers' attention in early September when she shared a series of outfit photos in the retailer's cream 'Pleated Jeans'.</p>

<p>They are remarkably similar to $295 palazzo pants from Australian designer label Aje, which is headquartered in Sydney's Paddington.</p>

<p>Both trousers have deep double-front pockets, flared hems and thick waistbands that sit high above the hips in a flattering style that conceals the tricky-to-tone expanse of the lower stomach.</p>

<p>The biggest difference is that Aje's are almost 12 times the price.</p>

<p>Luxe for less: Sydney fashion blogger Angel Perez wears the $25 'Pleated Jeans' from Kmart, which look considerably more expensive than their bargain price tag</p>

<p>Aje's $295 palazzo pants (pictured) have the same front pockets, flared hems and thick waist band as Kmart's $25 pleated jeans</p>

<p>Women have been racing to Kmart to buy the 'perfectly elegant' discount dupe which looks considerably more expensive than its bargain tag.</p>

<p>Comments on stylist Angel Perez's Instagram reveal just how taken people are with the design, with responses including 'so elegant', 'love this look' and 'beautiful pants'.</p>

<p>'I love how high-waisted those trousers are!' one woman replied.</p>

<p>Another said she'd been inspired to buy them after seeing how flattering and well tailored they appeared on Ms Perez.</p>
