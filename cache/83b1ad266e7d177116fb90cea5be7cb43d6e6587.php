<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Clinical trials of Russia's 'world first' coronavirus vaccine have produced questionable results, a group of global scientists has claimed.</p>

<p>Initial reports on whether the Sputnik V vaccine safely produces an immune response were published in the Lancet this month.</p>

<p>Now international scientists have flagged up several apparent anomalies.</p>

<p>Initial reports on whether the Sputnik V vaccine safely produces an immune response were published in the Lancet this month (stock image used)</p>

<p>Graphs showing the level of immune response in different people, at different time points after taking the vaccine, appear to show repeating patterns of data. </p>

<p>The experts, who have written to the medical journal to raise the alarm, suggest it is 'unlikely' to be accidental.</p>

<p>They have requested the data behind the graphs, which the Russian vaccine team has said it will provide.</p>

<p>Dr Christoffer van Tulleken, an associate professor at University College London, said: 'This number of irregularities add up to a series of coincidences that appear extremely unlikely. </p>

<p>'It may be that there are simple explanations or an honest mistake, but anything that undermines public faith in vaccines costs lives.'</p>

<p>The Lancet routinely publishes letters criticising studies in the journal, and can invite researchers to respond, as the Russian team did in detail in this case. </p>

<p>Dr Denis Logunov, of the Moscow research institute, which developed the vaccine, said: 'We categorically deny the accusations of inaccurate statistical data published in The Lancet.'</p>

<p>Russia was the first country to approve a vaccine after only a few months of trials and President Vladimir Putin said it had been tested on one of his own daughters.</p>
