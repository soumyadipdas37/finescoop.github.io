<p>Just one year later, Ben created shockwaves when he married his second wife Jackie on board a luxury yacht in Nantucket, Massachusetts, just two weeks after they started dating. </p>

<p>The US socialite announced her pregnancy soon after, and the couple welcomed their daughter Farrah Abra Foden in May this year, born three weeks early following health complications. </p>

<p>Speaking in a candid interview with TV presenter Sharon Carpenter on Instagram Live last week, Ben admitted he did not act in a particularly kind way towards Una.    </p>

<p>'I hold my hands up and say, it was wrong,' he said. 'My final decree didn't even come through until the morning of us getting married.'   </p>

<p>Whirlwind romance: Ben married American Jackie Belanoff Smith in Nantucket after just two weeks of dating on the morning that his divorce came through last August</p>

<p>The former England rugby player nonetheless maintained he had no regrets.     </p>

<p>'People will say I wasn't very ­respectful in what I did, getting married to Jackie very quickly, but you can't help the heart and we've got past it.'</p>

<p>The couple now live in America, where they are raising Farrah.</p>

<p>Ben also co-parents a daughter Aoife, eight, and son Tadhg, five, with Una.  </p>

<p>Wasn't to be: It comes after the rugby player, 35, admitted it was 'wrong' to marry Jackie on the day his divorce from ex-wife Una Healy, 38, was granted (pictured in 2017)</p>

<p>Ben also described the period after he split from Una in his interview with Sharon Carpenter. </p>

<p>He said: 'I did a lot of dating. I went a bit crazy for about six-seven months, on a few of the well known apps. I had a lot of fun.</p>

<p>'When I met Jackie, she was like no one I've ever met before in so many departments. She's very independent, very free-spirited. </p>

<p> 'She was at a point where she was like, "I want to meet someone and get married and have kids". Even though in my head I was like, "Oh I don't really want to do that" I knew she'd make such a good mum.</p>

<p>'I knew she'd be really kind and respectful to my other kids from my other marriage.'</p>
