<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta admits that he is worried for players who are set to leave the Premier League's Covid-19 bubble to go on international duty next month. </p>

<p>The Arsenal manager was the first big name in English football to test positive for the virus, causing approximately 100 members of Arsenal staff, including his first-team squad, into self-isolation and triggered the suspension of Premier League matches.</p>

<p>Since then strict protocols have been put in place to protect players and staff from the virus, but Arteta worries the return of international duty could be 'bad news' as players jet off abroad.  </p>

<p>Mikel Arteta worries that international duty could be 'bad news' amid Covid-19 pandemic</p>

<p>The Arsenal manager said: 'We have much more information right now than we had many months ago when that happened.</p>

<p>'The bubbles that the Premier League, the clubs and the Government have been able to create to try to keep everybody as safe as possible are working really, really well.</p>

<p>'But we all know that the issue is still there.</p>

<p>'It is not going away and we have to keep the same approach and be always very careful, very conservative and try to maintain this business because it is really important in many, many aspects.</p>

<p>Arteta says the the bubbles that the Premier League have created are a safe environment </p>

<p>However, he says the 'issue is still there' and that going abroad could become problematic</p>

<p>'We are lucky in our profession that we have found a way. Not many professions can say that.</p>

<p>'Let's respect that and try to keep going in the best possible way.</p>

<p>'Obviously when everyone has to fly away to very different countries, I think at the moment it's a little bit of an experience.</p>

<p>'We don't know what the outcome is. We want to believe that they are going to follow a lot of things that are implemented and working well so fingers crossed we don't get any bad news.'</p>
