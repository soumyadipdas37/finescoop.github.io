<p>The unsuspecting driver had parked the car on a riverside road in Norfolk on Sunday - seemingly unaware that high spring tide would soon render the area more suitable for boats than for vehicles.</p>

<p>Bizarre photos show bemused sailors cruising past the near-drowned silver car, which appears to have its front, driver-side window left open as the water rose around it.</p>

<p>One image even shows a man in a speedboat approaching the car - seemingly trying to work out a way to rescue it.</p>

<p>The car was caught in the rapidly-rising tides on the Holkham estate, just down the road from Burnham Overy Boathouse.</p>

<p>Tim Gatti, who manages the boathouse, has warned other drivers to be wary of the high tides - which happen twice a day and, most of the time, will flood that bit of the road.</p>

<p>Tim, 70, who has worked at the boathouse for the last five years, said: 'There are signs in place around that area telling drivers that it is not a formal car park, and should not be treated as one.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, some people do not know about the tides, and they turn up and think they're parking next to a little river - and then later, are very surprised.</p>

<p>'People need to bear in mind this is not just a gentle little river - this is a tidal estuary.</p>

<p>'We get high tides twice a day, and most high tides will flood that bit of road. It is not always as bad as that - the tide varies each day.'</p>

<p>Tim added that the drowned car on Sunday is by no means an isolated incident.</p>

<p>He said: 'It is not just visitors who fall foul of the tide on that road - locals do it too.</p>

<p>'They'll park their cars there and then later realise and feel silly about it.</p>

<p>'I'd say we've had more incidents this summer because lots of tourists have been flocking to the coast for a holiday during the Covid pandemic.</p>

<p>'I've seen it happen about five times this summer.</p>

<p>'This particular car was completely flooded. It took about a day to get a recovery vehicle down to rescue it.'</p>

<p>Tim urged visitors to the coast to check the tide timetables, which can be found at the boathouse.</p>
