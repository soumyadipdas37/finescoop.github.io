<p>'Breaks my heart, breaks my heart,' Ancelotti told the Echo.</p>

<p>Thiago and now Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti worked together at Bayern Munich in 2016</p>

<p>'Thiago is a friend. He is a fantastic player, a fantastic midfielder. I had the luck in my career to train top, top players and Thiago is one of them.</p>

<p>'The only good thing about this signing is that he is a neighbour and that's it. I think he chose the wrong team. </p>

<p>'He could choose the blue team, not the red team. I am joking. He is a fantastic player and my friend, Jurgen, will be happy. ' </p>

<p>Liverpool have made an emphatic statement of their intent to retain the Premier League title by spending £65million to land Thiago and Diogo Jota.</p>

<p>Liverpool have confirmed the signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich for £25million</p>

<p>Thiago was unveiled on Friday as he completed his £25m switch from Bayern Munich, passing a medical after arriving on an early private flight into Manchester.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp is thrilled to have signed one of the world’s best midfielders and could hand him a debut at Chelsea on Sunday.</p>

<p>The double signings show Liverpool mean business and Klopp is in no doubt that Thiago, in particular, will make a significant difference.</p>

<p>Officials at Bayern are distraught to have lost the 29-year-old Spain midfielder and the Liverpool manager could understand why.</p>

<p>The 29 year-old has signed a four year contract at Anfield after joining Bayern Munich in 2013</p>
