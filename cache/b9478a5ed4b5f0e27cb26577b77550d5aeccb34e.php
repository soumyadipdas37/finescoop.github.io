<p>The guests: The Dash Dolls star had a big celebrity turnout with Kimora Lee Simons, Kim Zolciak and her daughter Brielle </p>

<p>And Malika's partner OT also stopped by for a photo op.</p>

<p>Khloe, 36, was very supportive of Malika, 37.</p>

<p>Due to the stress of being a single mom and moving into a new home, Khloe decided to take the reigns on planning Malika's impending baby shower, with the help of Malika's twin sister Khadijah.</p>

<p>The pair, who have been lifelong friends, met up at Malika's brand new home.    </p>

<p>Family in attendance: Also there was Khloe's family - sister Kylie Jenner, Kris Jenner, and Kourtney Kardashian</p>

<p>Eager: The youngest Kardashian kept looking at the ballroom's entrance to see if Malika had arrived; in the background is Kylie</p>

<p>Supportive: 'I want to be there for Malika as much as I can and as best as I can. She has to be setting up a nursery...there are so many new things that Malika is gonna be taking on,' explained Khloe empathetically</p>

<p>'I want to be there for Malika as much as I can and as best as I can. She has to be setting up a nursery...there are so many new things that Malika is gonna be taking on,' explained Khloe empathetically.</p>

<p>She then began to ask Malika about how she was going to set up her soon-to-be newborn son's nursery.  </p>

<p>'When are you gonna start putting his room together?' Khloe inquired.</p>

<p>Malika explained that she wants 'to do it sooner rather than later,' but 'when [she talks] to [her] son's father, he goes, "Oh, we have time for that." That's his answer to everything. [And Malika is] like, "Good to know you're not gonna be any f**king help."'</p>

<p>Sooner than later: Malika explained that she wants 'to do it sooner rather than later,' but 'when [she talks] to [her] son's father, he goes, "Oh, we have time for that." That's his answer to everything. [And Malika is] like, "Good to know you're not gonna be any f**king help"'</p>

<p>What about the baby daddy? After briefly discussing Malika's desire to paint the baby's room in a black and white color scheme, Khloe felt the need to ask Malika about O.T.'s involvement in preparing for the baby</p>

<p>In order to help the devout Keeping Up With Kardashians audience understand the dynamic of her relationship with her baby daddy, provided some dating history in a confessional. </p>

<p>'Me and my son's father [rapper O.T. Genasis] actually dated for, like, two and a half years. But we're just in two different places in our lives and... I decided that it was better for me to not stay in the relationship because it was just getting harder and harder, but we've agreed to co-parent and bring our son into a loving environment, and that's the most important thing.' </p>

<p>After briefly discussing Malika's desire to paint the baby's room in a black and white color scheme, Khloe felt the need to ask Malika about O.T.'s involvement in preparing for the baby. </p>

<p>Clearly a touchy subject, Malika said that although her and O.T. 'had a good talk yesterday,' they desperately 'need to start talking about how we're going to parent, like, so it isn't something that we're just talking about when the baby gets here.'</p>

<p>From her mouth: In order to help the devout Keeping Up With Kardashians audience understand the dynamic of her relationship with her baby daddy, provided some dating history in a confessional</p>

<p>Co-parenting: 'Me and my son's father [rapper O.T. Genasis] actually dated for, like, two and a half years. But we're just in two different places in our lives and... I decided that it was better for me to not stay in the relationship because it was just getting harder and harder, but we've agreed to co-parent and bring our son into a loving environment, and that's the most important thing,' Malika explained</p>

<p>Feeling alone: Malika went on to express her frustration over her full plate and how she feels like she is doing everything to prepare for the baby, herself</p>

<p>'We actually had a good talk yesterday. I'm like, we do need to start talking about how we're going to parent, like, so it isn't something that we're just talking about when the baby gets here.'</p>

<p>She went on to express her frustration over her full plate and how she feels like she is doing everything to prepare for the baby, herself.</p>

<p>Khloe, who also happens to be a single mom to two-year-old daughter True, admitted that all of the things Malika is having to deal with, such as 'paying a mortgage' and 'doing all these things on her own' would even be tough for her to handle. </p>

<p>'She's now gonna take care of the baby. All these things-- it's overwhelming.'</p>

<p>A few days later, Khloe meets up for lunch with Malika's twin sister Khadijah to discuss the details going into Malika's upcoming baby shower. </p>

<p>Planning: A few days later, Khloe meets up for lunch with Malika's twin sister Khadijah to discuss the details going into Malika's upcoming baby shower</p>

<p>Asking Malika: Khloe and Khadijah end up calling Malika on the phone because they wanted to run some of the details they had planned by her, especially since 'the baby shower is in a week'</p>

<p>'I think we're gonna give her what she wants, but I think it's also gonna be like, we did this for you,' said Khadijah as the pair dined. 'It's a collaboration,' added Khloe.</p>

<p>Khloe and Khadijah end up calling Malika on the phone because they wanted to run some of the details they had planned by her, especially since 'the baby shower is in a week.'</p>

<p>While on the phone with Khloe and Khadijah, Malika sounds noticeably stressed, especially after Khloe and Khadijah suggest that she should narrow down her guest list from 50 people to 40. </p>

<p>Malika, clearly irked by the suggestion, admitted that she feels as if her baby shower is being hijacked by Khloe and her twin sister.</p>

<p>Irked: Malika, clearly irked by the suggestion, admitted that she feels as if her baby shower is being hijacked by Khloe and her twin sister</p>

<p>Take two: Once Khloe and Khadijah left the restaurant they were eating at, the pair returned to Khloe's car and redialed Malika</p>

<p>'It's not becoming what Malika wants it to be. It's becoming what everybody else wants it to be,' said the expectant mother, before hanging up the phone on Khloe. </p>

<p>Once Khloe and Khadijah left the restaurant they were eating at, the pair returned to Khloe's car and redialed Malika. </p>

<p>When Malika picks up the phone, she sounds as if she is crying, which prompts Khloe to ask: 'Are you crying?' </p>

<p>'I'm just really stressed out. It's bad enough. I'm not in the best situation. I'm trying to do the best that I can, and, like, even little (bleep) That I'm supposed to enjoy, like my shower... I know that Malika bursting into tears really has nothing to do with Khadijah or myself. We can imagine that it has something to do with O.T. It's something that's deeper than us. I definitely empathize with her, but I just want her to always feel reassured that I'm there for her.' </p>

<p>Wow: Flash forward one week, and It is the day of Malika's baby shower and Khloe is in awe at how all the decor came out</p>

<p>Flash forward one week, and It is the day of Malika's baby shower and Khloe is in awe at how all the decor came out.  </p>

<p>Khloe, who is eager to earn approval from Malika for her party planning, greets guests, like sister Kylie Jenner, Kris Jenner, and Kourtney Kardashian as they arrive.</p>

<p>The youngest Kardashian kept looking at the ballroom's entrance to see if Malika had arrived.  </p>

<p>'Oh, is she here? I'm getting stressed out. She did say no to quite a few things. She's so crazy,' she said with a laugh to Kris and Kourtney.</p>

<p>'She wanted this all black and white. I was like, "No." And I incorporated bears, which she was not into. God forbid. So I really hope she likes everything that we did for her.'</p>

<p>Stunned: Lady of honor: After much suspense, Malika arrives in a stunning blush toned dress that perfectly encapsulates her baby bump</p>

<p>Thankful: 'Oh my god,' she says, while taking in the awe-inspiring decor, food displays, etc. that Khloe worked tirelessly to put together for her. She made her way to Khloe and could not stop thanking her</p>

<p>'To see Malika with this beaming smile, she's glowing from the inside out, everybody's praising her. This is all about how beautiful of an experience this is, a moment in time. And this is how she should remember her pregnancy,' said Khloe in her confessional.</p>

<p>At her baby shower, Malika, with mic in hand, stood before all of her guest, which included baby daddy O.T. Genasis.</p>

<p>Beaming: 'To see Malika with this beaming smile, she's glowing from the inside out, everybody's praising her. This is all about how beautiful of an experience this is, a moment in time. And this is how she should remember her pregnancy,' said Khloe in her confessional</p>

<p>In attendance: At her baby shower, Malika, with mic in hand, stood before all of her guest, which included baby daddy O.T. Genasis</p>

<p>Emotional: 'The reason why I really wanted to have a shower is because it's you women that have helped me get through this pregnancy, 100%. And I'm incredibly thankful to Odis Flores for my little boy,' she said as she pointed in O.T.'s direction</p>

<p>'I know that co-parenting is a really long journey, and it's gonna be... Ups, there's gonna be downs. And I love that O.T. Came today, and I know that makes Malika feel really good about everything. </p>

<p>'Cause all she wants anybody to do is be excited there's a baby, there's an angel coming into the world,' concluded Khloe, before sharing some sweet moments with her pregnant bestie. </p>

<p>Best friends forever: 'Cause all she wants anybody to do is be excited there's a baby, there's an angel coming into the world,' concluded Khloe, before sharing some sweet moments with her pregnant bestie</p>

<p>Also on the show Khloe and brother-in-law Scott Disick took another stab at their infamous 'Kris Jenner Paparazzi prank' in the hopes of finally fooling the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch.  </p>

<p>In a confessional, Khloe explained that 'months ago,' with the help of Scott and her older sister Kim Kardashian, she dressed up as Kris and posed for a slew of fake paparazzi images. </p>

<p>Round two: Khloe and brother-in-law Scott Disick took another stab at their infamous 'Kris Jenner Paparazzi prank' in the hopes of finally fooling the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch</p>

<p>First time around: In a confessional, Khloe explained that 'months ago,' with the help of Scott and her older sister Kim Kardashian, she dressed up as Kris and posed for a slew of fake paparazzi images</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, the 'first set of photos weren't that believable.'</p>

<p>'So tonight is the start of phase two,' said Khloe with a menacing grin, before launching into the elaborate new plan she formed with Kim and Scott.</p>

<p>In order to get 'more realistic photos,' Khloe and Kim take Kris and Kris' longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble out to dinner with the intention of getting Kris 'belligerently drunk.'</p>

<p>'Right now, the plan is to get her belligerently drunk so she essentially blacks out and can't really remember what she did tonight,' explained Khloe to the camera, before Kim shot her a look.</p>

<p>'Not like a blackout. We just want her to not remember,' said Kim, attempting to clarify their intentions. But Khloe, set in her ways, corrected Kim and said: 'A blackout.'</p>

<p>Waiters approach their table and one of them begins shaking up a martini, which causes Kris to jump in her seat.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>New plan: In order to get 'more realistic photos,' Khloe and Kim take Kris and Kris' longtime boyfriend Corey Gamble out to dinner with the intention of getting Kris 'belligerently drunk'</p>

<p>Poker face: 'Right now, the plan is to get her belligerently drunk so she essentially blacks out and can't really remember what she did tonight,' explained Khloe to the camera, before Kim shot her a look</p>

<p>'Mom, do you want one?' Khloe asked Kris, but the 64-year-old businesswoman immediately dismissed the idea.</p>

<p>In order to convince her mom to order a martini, Khloe lies and tells Kris that she, herself, 'has never had a martini' before.</p>

<p>'We should have one. I've never had a martini,' said, Khloe, and, as if he were in sync with the plan, the waiter notifies Kris that the martini is 'on the house' </p>

<p>'Oh, on the house?' asks Kris, before taking the martini from the waiter and indulging in a sip. </p>

<p>'I have the bartender giving Mom her dirty martinis, and I have my water martinis, um, that the bartenders are giving me,' explained Khloe in another side-by-side confessional with Kim</p>

<p>You heard me: 'Not like a blackout. We just want her to not remember,' said Kim, attempting to clarify their intentions. But Khloe, set in her ways, corrected Kim and said: 'A blackout'</p>

<p>'And Mom thinks this is my first time ever having a martini, so I have to do the whole... Like, "Oh, this is so bad,"' said Khloe in a mocking tone.</p>

<p>'You're such a good actress,' said Kim, to which Khloe replied: 'Thank you. I'm good at pretending to be drunk.'</p>

<p>After swinging back a plethora of mixed drinks, Kris gets undeniably tipsy, which prompts Kim and Khloe to celebrate a job well done. </p>

<p>Khloe, proud of their success, took a moment to revel over their fool-proof prank plan. </p>

<p>Coming on strong: Waiters approach their table and one of them begins shaking up a martini, which causes Kris to jump in her seat</p>

<p>C'mon: 'Mom, do you want one?' Khloe asked Kris, but the 64-year-old businesswoman immediately dismissed the idea</p>

<p>Twisted my arm: And Mom thinks this is my first time ever having a martini, so I have to do the whole... Like, "Oh, this is so bad,"' said Khloe in a mocking tone</p>

<p>'And I will be in the Kris Jenner outfit from my toes to my jewelry. It's all gonna match spot-on, and it's gonna look so perfect that she won't know if it was her or the imposter,' she explained. </p>

<p>Later, Scott, with a camera in hand, meets Khloe at a near by liquor store.</p>

<p>Khloe arrives to the hilarious photoshoot in her Kris Jenner get-up, which she revealed actually belonged to her mom. </p>

<p>'Did you get her rocked, is the question?,' asked Scott, referring to Khloe and Kim feeding Kris drinks the other night at dinner.</p>

<p>Khloe replied in the affirmative and noted that her mom was so exhausted from the booze-filled dinner, that 'she threw all of the clothes that she was wearing [all over the floor]' and that [Kris'] assistant handed [the clothes] over to Kim to give to [Khloe].'</p>

<p>Success: After swinging back a plethora of mixed drinks, Kris gets undeniably tipsy, which prompts Kim and Khloe to celebrate a job well done</p>

<p>Scott begins snapping photos of Khloe - dressed as Kris - looking tipsy, while exiting the passenger's side of her SUV.</p>

<p>They then move over to a nearby bush and Khloe dramatically falls into it with a Mastro's bag and a bottle of vodka in hand.</p>

<p>Without warning, Khloe, committed to the gag, crawls into the liquor store's dumpster in order for Scott to capture the most mortifying shot.  </p>

<p>'You're diving. You're going to throw something out. That's all. You're a little tipsy. More spill, more spill. Hop up in there, Khloe,' said Scott while snapping pics, before noting in his confessional that he felt like 'Spielberg out there, shooting this sh*t.'</p>

<p>After capturing enough Kris Jenner content, Khloe went on to reveal the third portion of their prank's master plan. </p>

<p>Photoshoot time: Later, Scott, with a camera in hand, meets Khloe at a near by liquor store</p>

<p>Ready to go: Khloe arrives to the hilarious photoshoot in her Kris Jenner get-up, which she revealed actually belonged to her mom</p>

<p>Acting: Scott begins snapping photos of Khloe - dressed as Kris - looking tipsy, while exiting the passenger's side of her SUV</p>

<p>'We have decided that we're gonna get Christy, our PR representative, to leak the photos. We cannot wait. We think it's more authentic and genuine coming from her. Yeah.'</p>

<p>Scott added: 'It's just digging... When we do these pranks, we go... -We go all in.'</p>

<p>The day to unveil the hilariously horrific faux photos of Kris Jenner has come and Scott heads out to Khloe's house to witness the big reveal.</p>

<p>Once Scott arrives, Khloe picks her cellphone and dials the family's publicist Christy to sort out the sick details.</p>

<p>Khloe reveals to Christy that 'Kris is [currently] in the car with Corey and he is fully aware [of the prank].'</p>

<p>Committed: Without warning, Khloe, committed to the gag, crawls into the liquor store's dumpster in order for Scott to capture the most mortifying shot</p>

<p>Total pro: Scott, in his confessional, said that he felt like 'Spielberg out there, shooting this sh*t'</p>

<p>Work it: 'You're diving. You're going to throw something out. That's all. You're a little tipsy. More spill, more spill. Hop up in there, Khloe,' said Scott while snapping pics</p>

<p>'This morning, we figured it was best that we involve Corey in on the prank, because he was with her the night that she got drunk and "Took these photos."'</p>

<p>Christy, keeping Scott and Khloe on the line, calls up Kris Jenner and says: 'So, TMZ called yesterday, and they have-- you know, kind of following up from the images last time-- they have images of you from Monday night.'</p>

<p>Kris, immediately, shoots a confused look in Corey's direction, before prompting Christy to explain further.</p>

<p>'They're of you going into the Malibu, like, liquor store, and you have a bottle of vodka,' concluded Christy, which caused Kris' mouth to visibly drop.</p>

<p>Phase three: 'We have decided that we're gonna get Christy, our PR representative, to leak the photos. We cannot wait. We think it's more authentic and genuine coming from her. Yeah' explained Khloe</p>

<p>Time has come: The day to unveil the hilariously horrific faux photos of Kris Jenner has come and Scott heads out to Khloe's house to witness the big reveal</p>

<p>Wheels in motion: Khloe reveals to Kris' publicist Christy that 'Kris is [currently] in the car with Corey and he is fully aware [of the prank]'</p>

<p>Kris then asks Corey, who is sitting next to her, to help her recall the fuzzy events of 'Monday night.'   </p>

<p>'We did s-stop,' said Corey, to which prompted Kris to ask 'where' they stopped.  </p>

<p>'In Malibu, on the way home. I got out of the car, and then you was out of the car when I came back,' explained Corey, who was trying his hardest not to break.</p>

<p>In her own confessional, Jenner admitted that on Monday night she knew that she 'was really tipsy and [she had] had a lot to drink, but [she] always relies on Corey.'  </p>

<p>'I couldn't have any more security. And yet somebody has photos of me... ...Drunk as a skunk at a pit stop that we apparently made, and I'm peeing in a parking lot. I couldn't be more mortified right now. I'm embarrassed, I'm infuriated with Corey. And now what the hell am I gonna do?'</p>

<p>Say what? Christy, keeping Scott and Khloe on the line, calls up Kris Jenner and says: 'So, TMZ called yesterday, and they have-- you know, kind of following up from the images last time-- they have images of you from Monday night'</p>

<p>Yikes: Kris, immediately, shoots a confused look in Corey's direction, before prompting Christy to explain further</p>

<p>Tell me everything: Kris then asks Corey, who is sitting next to her, to help her recall the fuzzy events of 'Monday night'</p>

<p>Kris, clearly reeling from learning about the unauthorized photos, heads to Khloe's house, where Scott is still present.</p>

<p>'Scott and I decided that we should get my mom over to my house so we could see her sort of squirm in person,' explained Khloe to the viewers at home.  </p>

<p>But, as soon as she greets her mother and Corey at the door, Khloe knew that she was 'stressing about the photos.'</p>

<p>'It just turned really bad really quick and we just have to confess and come clean,' said Khloe as Scott nodded in agreement next to her.  </p>

<p>Khloe, in an attempt to put the prank to rest, confronts Kris about the photos, 'Mom, is this you peeing? Look, you're peeing.'</p>

<p>Freaking out: 'I couldn't have any more security. And yet somebody has photos of me... ...Drunk as a skunk at a pit stop that we apparently made, and I'm peeing in a parking lot. I couldn't be more mortified right now. I'm embarrassed, I'm infuriated with Corey. And now what the hell am I gonna do?' said Kris in her confessional</p>

<p>So mean: 'Scott and I decided that we should get my mom over to my house so we could see her sort of squirm in person,' explained Khloe to the viewers at home</p>

<p>Totally stressing: But, as soon as she greets her mother and Corey at the door, Khloe knew that she was 'stressing about the photos'</p>

<p>Kris, mortified that her own daughter has seen the pics, begins to stutter as she wracks her brain for an explanation. All she can come up with is, 'I don't know.'</p>

<p>Scott then attempts to break the news to her in a simpler way. </p>

<p>'Could you imagine another scenario?' he began. 'In another world, do you ever think that maybe, just, like, on our spare time, I get a camera and your daughter gets dressed up like you, and we do really weird things and look like Kris Jenner and send them to publicists?'</p>

<p>Kris stares at Scott and Khloe in pure confusion as if she is having trouble processing the pair's confession, but she then remarks with a smile: 'Wow. Wow. I honestly don't like you guys anymore.'</p>

<p>Coming clean: 'It just turned really bad really quick and we just have to confess and come clean,' said Khloe as Scott nodded in agreement next to her</p>

<p>They're not real: ''Could you imagine another scenario?' he began. 'In another world, do you ever think that maybe, just, like, on our spare time, I get a camera and your daughter gets dressed up like you, and we do really weird things and look like Kris Jenner and send them to publicists?' explained Scott to Kris</p>

<p>Not happy: Kris stares at Scott and Khloe in pure confusion as if she is having trouble processing the pair's confession, but she then remarks with a smile: 'Wow. Wow. I honestly don't like you guys anymore'</p>

<p>'We're trying to break the news to her that it's not her in the photos. She's not grasping it,' said Khloe in a confessional. 'We got her to really believe them. And that was the dream.'   </p>

<p>Kourtney tried out cuddling for some content for Poosh.</p>

<p>She then sat down with her team, which includes her assistant-turned-best friend Stephanie Shepherd, to throw out an idea about exploring 'odd jobs, you know, like asmr.'</p>

<p>As Kourtney made her way through different odd job she could think of, someone in the room suggested that 'professional cuddlers' had the strangest profession. </p>

<p>'Maybe we just do an interesting story about cuddling. You know, at Poosh, we like to be, like, very discovery, and we could go, like, see them at their jobs, you know?' said Kourtney.</p>

<p>Conjuring up ideas: Amid the pranks and pregnancies, Kourtney Kardashian was busy brainstorming new content to post on her lifestyle website POOSH</p>

<p>Always working: 'Today, I have a little shoot to get some content for Poosh, and then, we also have a Poosh meeting to develop content. A lot of my energy does go to Poosh,' said the mother of three as she posed in a slinky outfit</p>

<p>She explained in a confessional that she relates to those in 'untraditional' careers because 'what [she] and [her] family do for a job isn't necessarily a traditional job.'</p>

<p>Eager to explore the world of professional cuddling, Kourtney and Stephanie show up to a cuddle sanctuary in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>'I do think that this is really fascinating. It does make me a little bit uncomfortable,' said the POOSH founder as the cuddle instructor encouraged everyone in the room to embrace.</p>

<p>Kourtney was clearly having a hard time engaging and admitted that she 'didn't really realize it, but [she thinks] that [she can't be] affectionate with just anybody.' </p>

<p>As Kourtney made her way through different odd job she could think of, someone in the room suggested that 'professional cuddlers' had the strangest profession </p>

<p>Relatable: She explained in a confessional that she relates to those in 'untraditional' careers because 'what [she] and [her] family do for a job isn't necessarily a traditional job'</p>

<p>Cuddling: 'Maybe we just do an interesting story about cuddling. You know, at Poosh, we like to be, like, very discovery, and we could go, like, see them at their jobs, you know?' said Kourtney</p>

<p>'No, I swear. Now that I've been here, I never realized it. 'Cause I'm super cuddly, like, with my boyfriend. You know? Or my kids,' she elaborated to Stephanie.</p>

<p>'But, like, did you get cuddled as a kid?' Stephanie asked, to which Kourtney replied: 'I don't know. Maybe not. I don't really remember being, like, cuddly with my mom.'</p>

<p>While speaking directly to the professional cuddler, Kourtney said that the experience at the cuddle sanctuary that day 'made [her] realize that [she is] not, like, a cuddly person in general, unless it's [her] boyfriend or [her] kids. Somewhere you feel, like, super safe, probably.' </p>

<p>'And I think it was interesting to get more clarification of what it is. I think it's really fascinating, you know, how much human touch we really need and that most people don't get,' concluded Kourtney, before graciously exiting the cuddle sanctuary with Stephanie by her side.</p>

<p>Learning: Eager to explore the world of professional cuddling, Kourtney and Stephanie show up to a cuddle sanctuary in Los Angeles</p>

<p>Hesitant: Kourtney was clearly having a hard time engaging and admitted that she 'didn't really realize it, but [she thinks] that [she can't be] affectionate with just anybody'</p>

<p>Not natural: 'No, I swear. Now that I've been here, I never realized it. 'Cause I'm super cuddly, like, with my boyfriend. You know? Or my kids,' she elaborated to Stephanie</p>

<p>Following their cuddle session, Kourtney and Stephanie met up with Kourtney's younger half-sister Kendall Jenner and a male pal to discuss the strange experience.  </p>

<p>'Um, you have no idea what we just did. We went to this cuddling sanctuary,' began Kourtney. But Kendall, already knowing what she was referring to began to laugh and nod.  </p>

<p>'You know about it?' asked Kourtney, to which Kendall replied: 'No. My friends did it. So awkward, huh?'     </p>

<p>Kendall admitted that she is 'not a super cuddly person either' and that it 'took [her] a long time to be cuddly' with [her boyfriend].'</p>

<p>Honest answer: While speaking directly to the professional cuddler, Kourtney said that the experience at the cuddle sanctuary that day 'made [her] realize that [she is] not, like, a cuddly person in general, unless it's [her] boyfriend or [her] kids. Somewhere you feel, like, super safe, probably'</p>

<p>Interesting experience: 'And I think it was interesting to get more clarification of what it is. I think it's really fascinating, you know, how much human touch we really need and that most people don't get,' concluded Kourtney, before graciously exiting the cuddle sanctuary with Stephanie by her side</p>

<p>In an effort to alleviate herself and her family of their aversion to affection, Kourtney arranges for a professional cuddler to set up shop in her backyard.</p>

<p>She invited Khloe, Kim, and Kris over to engage in the awkward practice as a family.  </p>

<p>When Khloe arrives, Kourtney, with an stiff frame, wraps her arms around her sister and holds her close.</p>

<p>Khloe was clearly weirded out by the gesture, which encouraged Kourtney to share that she 'just gave Kim a hug the other day. -It was definitely awkward.' </p>

<p>'I am just so curious as to why affection in our family is so awkward and uncomfortable. And so I'm just going to lean in to this uncomfortable-ness, if that's even a word,' said Kourtney in her confessional. </p>

<p>Discussion: Following their cuddle session, Kourtney and Stephanie met up with Kourtney's younger half-sister Kendall Jenner and a male pal to discuss the strange experience</p>

<p>Familiar: 'Um, you have no idea what we just did. We went to this cuddling sanctuary,' began Kourtney. But Kendall, already knowing what she was referring to began to laugh and nod</p>

<p>Same way: Kendall admitted that she is 'not a super cuddly person either' and that it 'took [her] a long time to be cuddly' with [her boyfriend]'</p>

<p>Khloe attempted to reassure her sister that not being into physical affection doesn't reflect on who she is as a person.  </p>

<p>'No. -No, no, no. But I just thought it was interesting, so I wonder if everyone feels like we're not super cuddly,' Kourtney clarified.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Khloe said that she is 'a very affectionate person, and Kourtney and [her] used to be way more touchy-feely. But recently not so much.'</p>

<p>Once the family is all together, they all headed into the backyard, where the professional cuddler was waiting in her tent. </p>

<p>An idea: In an effort to alleviate herself and her family of their aversion to affection, Kourtney arranges for a professional cuddler to set up shop in her backyard</p>

<p>Hug it out: When Khloe arrives, Kourtney, with an stiff frame, wraps her arms around her sister and holds her close</p>

<p>Awkward: Khloe was clearly weirded out by the gesture, which encouraged Kourtney to share that she 'just gave Kim a hug the other day. -It was definitely awkward'</p>

<p>'She's in there. This is a professional cuddler,' said Kourtney pointing to the tent, to which Khloe passionately replied: 'What? She's gonna cuddle us? No, I don't hug strangers like that.' </p>

<p>'No, trust me. She'll just guide it. Let's go do this together. I thought it would be a great thing,' reassured Kourtney.</p>

<p>They partook in a ton of uncomfortable cuddling exercises, which prompts a lot of laughter, but once they got past the awkward stage, Kourtney said that she thought 'it actually does feel nice to just lay here with each other.'  </p>

<p>Cuddle time: Once the family is all together, they all headed into the backyard, where the professional cuddler was waiting in her tent</p>

<p>Out of their comfort zone: They partook in a ton of uncomfortable cuddling exercises, which prompts a lot of laughter, but once they got past the awkward stage, Kourtney said that she thought 'it actually does feel nice to just lay here with each other'</p>
