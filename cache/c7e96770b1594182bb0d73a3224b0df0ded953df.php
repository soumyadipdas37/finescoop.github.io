<p>Manchester City are closing on a £50million deal for Benfica defender Ruben Dias</p>

<p>'I'm very happy of course, it was a very important game for me and being able to mark this game with a goal was very special. I believe that everyone already has a idea of why I hugged Rui Costa.'</p>

<p>City have offered cash plus defender Nicolas Otamendi in negotiations and hope to conclude the finer details by the start of the week.</p>

<p>Benfica manager, Jorge Jesus on Ruben Dias: 'I'm pretty sure it was his last game. He's a player we're sorry to see go. But I also have some fault that he left today. This also has to do with missing the Champions League and there are things that need to be balanced.' </p>

<p>Dias scored in Benfica's win over Moreirense before hugging his team-mates at the full-time</p>

<p>Dias has a long-term contract until the summer of 2024 at the Portuguese side.</p>
