<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Switzerland unveils plans to spend billions on new fighter jets despite not having fought in a war in more than 200 years.</p>

<p>The plans have been faced with much opposition, as many believe the notoriously neutral country can't afford the war planes and doesn't need them.</p>

<p>Voters get their say on September 27 on whether the plan to spend 6 billion Swiss franc on the jets should go ahead, according to CNA.  </p>

<p>Switzerland unveils plans to spend billions on new fighter jets to replace its ageing fleet of 30 F/A-18 Hornets which will go out of service in 2030 (pictured)</p>

<p>The aircraft would replace Switzerland's ageing fleet of 30 F/A-18 Hornets which will go out of service in 2030.    </p>

<p>Choices for the aircraft could be the Eurofighter from Airbus or the Lockheed Martin F35-A Lightning II amongst others.   </p>

<p>Priska Seiler Graf, a member of parliament for the left-leaning Social Democrats, called plans 'absurd' and asked who would attack a country 'surrounded by NATO'. </p>

<p>She agreed the country needed a new aircraft, but said a 'simpler aircraft' would be enough and said it would be 'better to have a Fiat than a Maserati'. </p>

<p>Six years ago, voters in Switzerland rejected the purchase of Gripen jets from Sweden.</p>

<p>In 1989 a proposal to scrap its entire army got 35 per cent of voter support, but the Pope's Swiss guards are a reminder of the country's mercenary past. </p>

<p>Voters get their say on September 27 on whether the plan to spend 6 billion Swiss franc on the new jets should go ahead (pictured a Swiss Air Force F/A-18C Hornet) </p>

<p>Lawmaker Thomas Hurter from the right-wing Swiss People's Party, a former air force pilot, said Switzerland had to protect itself without relying on other countries.</p>

<p>He said smaller jets did not have the acceleration needed to react quickly to emergencies.</p>
