<p>'I'm gutted I haven't had the chance to enjoy this pregnancy like I wanted to because of lockdown,' she said in an Instagram post. </p>

<p>'No baby shopping, no listening to baby's heartbeat, no sharing this experience with my friends or family.'  </p>

<p>Millie previously said her baby was conceived during a six-month relationship with a boy around her own age.</p>

<p>They are no longer together but her former partner has vowed to be a part of his baby's life.</p>

<p>She adds the couple didn't use contraception but she wasn't worried about STI's as she 'trusted him' and had 'known him for years.'  </p>

<p>Pictured: The Radford family in 2018. Since then, Noel and Sue have had two more children, Bonnie and Heidi</p>

<p>Millie told The Sun: 'We didn't use protection. I knew there was a risk of pregnancy but I didn't think it'd be so easy.</p>

<p>'And I didn't worry about STIs, as I trusted him. I'd known him for years.'</p>

<p>And after the test which revealed she was two-to-three weeks pregnant in early January, Millie revealed how her 'fear' quickly turned to 'excitement' - despite being apprehensive about telling her parents.</p>

<p>But she said Sue, 45, and Noel, 49, who run a bakery business, were 'excited' with the new arrival which will make them grandparents to five.  </p>

<p>As for their own brood - Sue and Noel's most recent child is Heidi, who was born in April this year, with the others being Chris, 30, Sophie, 26, Chloe, 24, Jack, 22, Daniel, 21, Luke, 19, Millie, 18, Katie, 17, James, 16, Ellie, 14, Aimee, 13, Josh, 12, Max, 11, Tillie, nine, Oscar, eight, Casper, seven, Hallie, four, Phoebe, three, Archie 2 and Bonnie, 1. </p>

<p>The couple met for the first time when Sue was seven, before going on to have their first child when Sue was 14 and Noel was 19.</p>

<p>They got married in 1993 when Sue turned 18, and went on to have nine children before Noel had a vasectomy - which he later had reversed.</p>

<p>Sadly Alfie, the couple's 17th child, was still born on July 6th 2014.</p>
