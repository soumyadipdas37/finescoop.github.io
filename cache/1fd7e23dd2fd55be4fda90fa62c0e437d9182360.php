<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The former boss of Saga is set to make a stunning return to the ailing over-50s travel and insurance firm as part of a £150million fundraising deal. </p>

<p>Sir Roger De Haan will inject £100million of his own money for a 20 per cent shareholding in the business and a role as a chairman, Sky News reported.</p>

<p>It is looking to raise £50million from other investors. </p>

<p>Suffering: Saga – now run by Euan Sutherland, the former boss of Superdry – has been battered by the Covid-19 crisis</p>

<p>The son of Saga founder Sydney de Haan, Sir Roger's return comes 16 years after selling it to secretive private equity firm Charterhouse. </p>

<p>Saga – now run by Euan Sutherland, the former boss of Superdry – has been battered by the Covid-19 crisis. </p>

<p>In March, Saga was forced to suspend its cruises and forecast profits from that business would take a hit of £10million to £15million. </p>

<p>The size of the planned fundraise is almost equal to Saga's current market capitalisation. Sir Roger is likely to pay a premium for his Saga shares while other investors will be issued new stock at a discount. </p>

<p>Last year, it emerged Elliott had taken a 5 per cent shareholding in Saga, leading to speculation the American activist fund was pushing for a break-up of the business.</p>
