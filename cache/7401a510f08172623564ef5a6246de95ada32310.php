<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are still very much in the picture to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid this summer, according to reports.</p>

<p>Developments on Tuesday pointed to Bale returning to Tottenham after chairman Daniel Levy had held positive talks with the LaLiga champions about a loan deal which would see Madrid pay in-excess of 50 per cent of the Wales international's astronomical wages of up to £500,000-per-week.</p>

<p>Bale's agent Jonathan Barnett intensified speculation of a reunion by telling BBC Wales that 'Gareth still loves Spurs... It's where he wants to be.'</p>

<p>Real Madrid believe that Manchester United are still an option to sell Gareth Bale to</p>

<p>The Wales star is understood to be closing in on a return to Tottenham after breakthrough talks</p>

<p>However, a Madrid official has told AS that United are still seen as viable suitors for Bale despite seemingly losing ground on Tottenham in the race for his signature.</p>

<p>United retain an interest in Bale, who was identified as a target after they failed to reach an agreement with Borussia Dortmund for Jadon Sancho.</p>

<p>But United will need to strike while the iron is hot with Spurs already in progressive talks with Madrid and confident of concluding a deal.</p>

<p>Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was at the forefront of negotiations for Bale on Tuesday</p>

<p>Bale's agent said the forward still loves Spurs, where he spent six years before leaving for Real</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Tottenham have explored a loan or a permanent deal, which could include a swap for one of the club's premium first-team players, for Bale. </p>

<p>Sources even claimed that Spurs are even prepared to use Dele Alli as a makeweight in the deal for Bale, such was their determination to clinch a return for the 31-year-old.</p>

<p>Levy, who was also trying to close a deal for Real's £25million-rated left-back Sergio Reguilon, was at the forefront of Tottenham's negotiations on Tuesday.  </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sees Bale as an option and Man United remain in the frame to sign him</p>

<p>Similarly, United have an interest in the Spain international, who spent last season on loan at Sevilla but are set to be pipped by Spurs.</p>

<p>It is understood that Reguilon was originally attracted by a move to Old Trafford but the 23-year-old has been made aware of how desperate manager Jose Mourinho is to work with him, which has made a move to Spurs a very strong possibility.</p>

<p>Real are understood to want a buy-back clause in any departure for Reguilon, and Spurs are said to be more open to agreeing to that stipulation than United.</p>
