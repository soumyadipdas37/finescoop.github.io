<p>In spite of their concerns, private security firms did land the contracts, and up to 99 per cent of coronavirus cases in Victoria's second wave can now be traced back to returned travellers. </p>

<p>Victorian government officials were hesitant about hiring private security personnel to man the hotel quarantine program because they thought it was an industry run by 'cowboys'</p>

<p>They were also concerned about 'rogue' guards potentially 'prowling the corridors' of hotels, WhatsApp messages shown at an inquiry into the bungled program reveal</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the inquiry was shown several text messages between Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions staff on the evening of March 27.</p>

<p>'Gotta be careful with a lot of security companies. Heaps of cash work,' one bureaucrat warned.</p>

<p>'Cowboy industry,' another said.</p>

<p>'Needs to be reputable. Don't want (redacted) rogue (redacted) prowling the corridors,' another replied.</p>

<p>The inquiry is partially trying to decipher who made the final decision to hire private firms instead of utilising the services of the Australian Defence Force.   </p>

<p>The inquiry is working through evidence to establish if and how the quarantine program failed Victorians.  </p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews has been slammed for his handling of the coronavirus crisis</p>

<p>The inquiry is working through evidence to establish if and how the quarantine program failed Victorians</p>

<p>Jobs department secretary Simon Phemister told the inquiry his department was tasked with hiring security companies following a meeting at the state control centre on March 27.</p>

<p>Mr Phemister wasn't present at the meeting but knew it was attended by high-ranking Victoria Police officers as well as Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp.</p>

<p>'I don't know who made the decision,' Mr Phemister told the inquiry on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'All I know is that we were commissioned to procure private security in that 4.30pm meeting.' </p>

<p>According to recordings of the meeting, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Grainger told Mr Crisp it was the force's preference that private security be the 'first line of security'.</p>

<p>Victoria Police have since argued they were expressing a preference, not a direction. </p>

<p>The virus escaped several hotels after security guards unknowingly contracted the virus and spread it throughout their communities</p>

<p>Returned travellers arriving back at the Crown Promenade Hotel in Melbourne</p>

<p>Mr Phemister said his department was looking for companies with a track record of working with the government plus the ability to 'scale up' as more travellers returned home.</p>

<p>It was also considered 'valuable' if a security company had its own personal protective equipment supplies due to a shortage in Victoria at the time.</p>

<p>'The final point... we needed them to be good, model employers,' he said.</p>

<p>'Now more than ever, given the economic climate, we needed people who had a track record of being good to their teams and employing people on a correct and fair basis.' </p>

<p>There are several more officials required to give evidence to the inquiry, which is now in its final week of public hearings. </p>

<p>Department of Health and Human Services secretary Kym Peake sppeared on Tuesday, while Jobs Minister Martin Pakula and Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville are both due to give evidence on Wednesday. </p>

<p>Health Minister Jenny Mikakos and Premier Daniel Andrews have been pushed back to Thursday and Friday respectively due to scheduling issues.</p>

<p>'When I'll appear before the inquiry I'll answer the questions as honestly, frankly, clearly, directly as possible,' the premier told reporters at his daily news conference on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The inquiry continues. </p>
