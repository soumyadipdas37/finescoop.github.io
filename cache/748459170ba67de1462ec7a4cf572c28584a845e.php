<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A first-round victory in London's High Court may open the floodgates to billions of dollars' worth of claims against Lebanon's crisis-torn banking system. </p>

<p>Lawyers acting for Bilal Khalifeh, a UK resident with Lebanese nationality, persuaded the court that it has jurisdiction over Blom Bank of Beirut. </p>

<p>Blom is one of several Lebanese banks that have reacted to hyper-inflation by imposing what amount to exchange controls to prevent cash fleeing the country. </p>

<p>Victory: Lawyers acting for Bilal Khalifeh, a UK resident with Lebanese nationality, persuaded the court that it has jurisdiction over Blom Bank of Beirut</p>

<p>The legal team of Khalifeh, who has $1.44million (£1.1million) in Blom, argued that European Union consumer law gives courts anywhere in the bloc – and also in the UK, where the law is currently still in force – the right to hear cases such as this. </p>

<p>Blom's lawyers had argued the case should be heard in Lebanon, not London, and may appeal. </p>

<p>If the final outcome is in Khalifeh's favour, there could be similar claims from people across Europe with assets in Lebanese banks, leading to a huge outflow of cash from the country. </p>

<p>Joseph McCormick, of London law firm Rosenblatt which is representing Khalifeh, said: 'This is a significant ruling that shows Lebanese banks can be held to account before the English courts.' </p>

<p>Blom Bank, whose solicitors are Dechert, was not available for comment.</p>
