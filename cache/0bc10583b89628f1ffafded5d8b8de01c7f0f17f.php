<p>This week TV presenter Kirstie Allsopp checks in to our travel Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>She talks about her earliest holiday memory, her favourite place in the UK, her next holiday, to Switzerland, and why she loves India. </p>

<p>EARLIEST HOLIDAY MEMORY?</p>

<p>Visiting the Isle of Wight. My father was good at building sandcastles and took a proper garden spade away with him. He was proud that his buildings survived the waves when the tide came in.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE DESTINATION?</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to revisiting India. I last went nine years ago. Its diversity, colour and huge variety of food, landscapes and people are so appealing.</p>

<p>India is like a continent in its own right because the ­difference between north and south, from the hills to the beaches, is astounding.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE PLACE IN THE UK?</p>

<p>Kirstie recently had a trip to Beer in Devon (pictured) that was 'bliss'</p>

<p>Beer in Devon. </p>

<p>The bay is wonderful and there’s something special about sitting on the beach throwing stones into the water. </p>

<p>We visited recently and, after eating fish and chips, swam in the calm waters — it was bliss.</p>

<p>WHERE NEXT?</p>

<p>Kirstie says that her next holiday will be to Switzerland for a week. Pictured is Lake Brienz in Interlaken </p>

<p>We’re off to Switzerland for a week. It’s such an underrated destination. </p>

<p>We visited last August and enjoyed it so much, we’re going back.</p>

<p>It’s a cliché, but it’s breathtakingly beautiful. We’ll do plenty of walking in the mountains and swimming in the Alpine lakes.</p>

<p>WHAT CAN'T YOU TRAVEL WITHOUT?</p>

<p>A pot of Nivea cream, mosquito repellent (I’m inclined to be bitten by anything) and high-factor suncream because I go lobster red. I’ll always pack a swimming costume, too. I love to swim in the sea, rivers — anywhere. As a child, the most painful thing was visiting a place where it wasn’t safe to swim. I must have been a seal in a previous life.</p>

<p>EVER HAD A BAD FLIGHT?</p>

<p>Once, in the Bahamas, the plane took off in a massive storm. It was just me and the pilot and the rain was crashing against the window. Ultimately, you know it’ll be fine but that doesn’t stop you being nervous.</p>

<p>YOUR FAVOURITE WALK?</p>

<p>Kirstie says that her favourite walk is along Branscombe Beach in Devon, pictured </p>

<p>In Devon, we drive to Branscombe Beach, park and walk up a steep hill and along a ridge. There’s a two-­storey house, with one room at the bottom, one at the top, and I look at it every time I walk that path. It overlooks the sea and I’ve decided it’s where I want to live when I’m old.</p>

<p>DO YOU RELAX OR KEEP BUSY ON HOLIDAY?</p>

<p>At home I’m very tidy and domesticated so am often fiddling around in the house or organising things. When I’m away, I can’t do that, so I relax.</p>

<p>WHO IS YOUR DREAM TRAVEL COMPANION?</p>

<p>The Queen. I’d love to accompany her on a royal flight and discover how she trains her dogs. Perhaps she could give me some tips so I could train Dandy, my border terrier. </p>
