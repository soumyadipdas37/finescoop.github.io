<p>Growing up in London with Ghanaian ancestry, I would often visit Accra in the summer holidays with my family. </p>

<p>My mum would always bring back tons of raw shea butter in a solid lump that you'd have to heat up on the stove.</p>

<p>I went on to study communications at Coventry University, then took a job in PR. I never thought I'd set up my own beauty business.</p>

<p>Valerie Obaze, 40, lives between London and Accra, in Ghana, with her husband, Stan, and their three children, aged ten, eight and six</p>

<p>In 2009, I married and had my first child, Rebecca Rose. She started developing awful, red rashes. </p>

<p>None of the regular baby oils or creams agreed with her, then Mum gave me an amazing, unlabelled bottle of natural oil, which turned out to be shea.</p>

<p>It worked magic on my daughter — her rashes disappeared quickly and she had beautiful, buttery skin — so Stan and I started using it too, and it was amazing, so much easier to apply in liquid form.</p>

<p>That was my lightbulb moment. I realised we were on to something — this shea oil could be a massive gamechanger in skincare.</p>

<p>We launched R&amp;R Luxury, named after Rebecca Rose, in 2010. </p>

<p>I took several online courses in cosmetics compliance and organic formulation — my goal was to create a 'clean' product with as few ingredients as possible.</p>

<p>Lots of brands sell shea butters, but they contain only tiny amounts. </p>

<p>Valerie founded R&amp;R Luxury in 2010 after discovering how good shea oil was for her family's skin</p>

<p>We use it in its purest, rawest form: our oil is 100 per cent shea and we add only essential oils for their aromatherapeutic properties.</p>

<p>I also wanted to find a way of supporting the rural shea farmers in Ghana, 90 per cent of whom are women. </p>

<p> It can be a dangerous job, due to snake bites, and historically, they have not been rewarded sufficiently for their work.</p>

<p>We buy above market value and set up the Women of the Savannah Development Project to provide health, safety and business training to help break the poverty cycle.</p>

<p>R&amp;R Luxury now sells more than 30 products online in the UK, from scrubs to body butters, soaps and a moisturising lemongrass hand sanitiser, which we just launched.</p>

<p>The pandemic has been tough, we had to close our shops temporarily in Nigeria and Ghana, but our online sales have blown me away.</p>

<p>So many oils have become a trend and later disappeared, but I believe shea is a forever oil. </p>
