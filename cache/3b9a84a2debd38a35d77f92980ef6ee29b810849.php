<p>Letting her hair down: Wearing a red top and denim, she gave a pal a big hug</p>

<p>In the Dylan Blue ad, Bella kicked off the video wearing large gold earrings with her brunette tresses slicked back into a bun as she posed in front of large rock.</p>

<p>The camera went up and around the rock as someone is heard saying 'the world turns around and around' as three other models lounging on the rock are seen.</p>

<p>It comes up to the other side and Bella is seen now lounging in the sand wearing a sheer chiffon blue dress with a gaping midsection - revealing her midriff and glimpses of her cleavage. She was also wearing a plunging bathing suit beneath.</p>

<p>Shady lady: She also wore an incredible blue Versace swimsuit as she sat under an umbrella </p>

<p>The camera looped all the way around her until she appeared upside down in the frame. </p>

<p>Bella then appears facing the camera and close up, back in the black cut-out crop top and bikini bottoms; the model was spraying herself with the Versace Dylan Blue Fragrance.</p>

<p>Sexy: Bella wore a plunging blue dress which had a huge split going up the front </p>
