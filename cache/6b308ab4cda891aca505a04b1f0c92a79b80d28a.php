<p>A crime scene has been set up after remains were discovered at Little Bay and Miners Beach, located a 1km apart, in Port Macquarie on the mid north coast on Monday. </p>

<p>The beaches have been closed to the public while investigations continue. </p>

<p>NSW Police said the remains have been seized and will be sent away for further examination. </p>

<p>No further information is available at this stage.</p>

<p>It comes days after police abandoned a search for missing man Mark James whose car was found parked at Tacking Point lighthouse, 1k south of Miners Beach. </p>

<p>The 56-year-old Port Macquarie man was last seen at his home on September 18. </p>

<p>State Emergency Services, Surf Life Saving NSW and the NSW Water Police searched along the coastline and through bush but were unable to locate him.  </p>

<p>In June last year, human remains were found on nearby Flynns beach by two fishermen.   </p>

<p>The two bones were sent away for forensic testing and were later determined to belong to missing French backpacker Erwan Ferrieux, who disappeared with British friend Hugo Palmer, both 20, in February 2019. </p>
