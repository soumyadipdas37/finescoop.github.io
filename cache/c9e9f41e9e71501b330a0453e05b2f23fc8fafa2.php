<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nuno Espirito Santo is close to agreeing a new contract with Wolves ahead of their Premier League opener at Sheffield United on Monday.</p>

<p>The Portuguese boss has only one year left on his current deal and was considered by Arsenal last season before the appointment of Mikel Arteta. </p>

<p>Wolves have offered a substantial pay rise and hope Nuno will commit his future to the club until 2023.</p>

<p>Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is close to agreeing a new three-year deal with the club</p>

<p>Nuno has overseen a remarkable improvement in Wolves' fortunes since he took the job before the 2017-18 season, leading them to promotion from the Championship and consecutive seventh-place finishes in the Premier League, as well as the Europa League quarter-finals last month and the FA Cup semi-finals last season.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old called for new faces after Wolves' European campaign was ended by Sevilla in Germany last month, and executive chairman Jeff Shi has granted his wishes.</p>

<p>Wolves spent a club record fee of £35million to bring in 18-year-old forward Fabio Silva</p>

<p>Vitinha arrived on loan from Porto and Nuno is still on the lookout for a new right wing-back</p>

<p>A club-record £35million was spent on 18-year-old forward Fabio Silva from FC Porto, while midfielder Vitinha has joined on loan from the same club and defender Marcal has signed from Lyon for £1.8m.</p>

<p>Nuno is still on the look-out for a new right wing-back after Matt Doherty was sold to Tottenham for £15m and Wolves are expected to sign at least one more player before the transfer window closes next month.</p>

<p>After the Sevilla game, Nuno said: 'It's a small squad and we must be really proud, but now we need to make good decisions so we do not make mistakes like we did before. We need more players that can help us.'</p>
