<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Here’s a question: what do Kate Moss, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Cornwall, the editor of French Vogue Emmanuelle Alt, Jennifer Aniston, Princess Diana and Kaia Gerber have in common?</p>

<p>They have all, on many occasions, looked great in a blazer and jeans.</p>

<p>And what this broad church of women — ranging from 73-year-old royalty to an 18-year-old top model — prove, is that a blazer and jeans is not only timeless, but top of the charts of stylish looks that can be pulled off at any age.</p>

<p>You don’t have to be slim, or leggy, or ‘clever’ with colour, or great at layering. You just have to get the right blazer and jeans for the moment.</p>

<p>And with autumn around the corner, this is the time to take a closer look at what those are.</p>

<p>Kaia Gerber during Paris Fashion Week, France, March 2, 2020</p>

<p>Here is Cindy Crawford’s daughter Kaia Gerber in a check, two-button blazer with high, loose-fit jeans, modelling the look to perfection.</p>

<p>Forget overly fitted. Wear your blazer big: 20 per cent swamped is about right.</p>

<p>Make sure the jeans are loose in the leg, ideally high-waisted, but definitely not low-rise.</p>

<p>Keep it simple underneath, a shirt or polo neck.</p>

<p>Wear with trainers, sandals or ankle boots. </p>

<p>Off duty, model Kaia is a bit of a jeans-and-blazer hero. It’s her go-to smart casual look, and she’s been ahead of the curve on this for a while: she always picks the shruggy-shouldered jacket, whether it’s grey, navy, camel or check, sometimes going for giant, boxy shoulders and adding a white vest and stiletto sandals; sometimes a slimmer fit over a polo neck and ankle boots.</p>

<p>But this particular look — fresh, a bit uptown girl, but also very cool — is bang on the money for now and this autumn. The blazer is on the big side. It’s not drowning her (although drowning is OK, too), but it is roomy, a little wide on the shoulders and it finishes on the thigh rather than the hip.</p>

<p>Everything about the jacket is masculine — the fabric, the fit, the sharp lapels — it could definitely belong to a boyfriend, and that’s exactly how it’s meant to look. The goal is 20 per cent swamped. The jeans are clean and crisp.</p>

<p>The polo neck is the classic blazer-jeans buddy, but what you wear under your blazer depends on the weather and your mood: could be a white T-shirt, a polo neck, a high-necked bow-tied blouse. </p>

<p>Then all you need to make the look a fashion bullseye is big shades and trainers or sandals (switching to boots or loafers later in the year). Clever Kaia: she looks smoking hot, grown up and professional all at the same time.</p>

<p>As signature looks go, this is the only one that will take you from brunch to riding on the back of a motorbike to a show, and then out to dinner. And isn’t it great to be able to follow the lead of an 18-year-old with zero risk of dressing outside your age limit?</p>

<p>Kate Moss stays chic as can be as she wears a straight leg blue jean paired with peep toe heels and a black t-shirt and blazer combination</p>

<p>Kaia’s jeans are often from sustainable fashion brand RE/DONE, the blazers are from dizzyingly expensive labels The Row or Saint Laurent. Thankfully we don’t have to copy the brands, just the look. So here goes: Mango does a low, double-breasted blazer in a brown check that’s not dissimilar to Kaia’s (£59.99, mango.com). A double-breasted blazer works as well as single, but generally looks better left open.</p>

<p>And Other Stories has an oversize, two-button linen blazer in beige (£120, stories.com) or there’s Zara’s loose-fitting blazer also in a go-with-everything neutral (£69.99, zara.com). Meanwhile, the White Company does a relaxed double-breasted navy jacket (reduced to £79, thewhitecompany.com) and Reiss has a sharp, navy, double-breasted style (£285, reiss.com).</p>

<p>For a slightly narrower fit, Me + Em has a slim boyfriend blazer in green houndstooth (reduced to £192, meandem.com).</p>

<p>Cindy Crawford rocks an oversized blue-grey checked blazer paired with white loafers and shirt (left); Jennifer Aniston keeps it cool in a cropped sleeve black fitted blazer</p>

<p>My tip, as it’s on special offer, is All Saints’ cashmere blend, double-breasted blazer in camel or charcoal (£129, allsaints.com). It will go with everything.</p>

<p>The jeans to wear are those that fashion-forward women have been wearing for at least a year: high-waisted (or mid-rise), straight cut and loose in the leg. But if you prefer those Celine-esque lean flares, or wide legs, that’s fine too, and they can be indigo, black or white — so long as they’re not ripped or faded and look sharp.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a jeans tip, Topshop’s Editor design is a big hit with fashion editors now (£39.20, topshop.com). If only everything were this easy.</p>
