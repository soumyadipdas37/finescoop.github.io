<p>Icy particles clung to his clothes and during one patch Mr Woodward almost fell over.</p>

<p>Mr Woodward even has a close brush with an oncoming car attempting to brave the snow.   </p>

<p>'As I went down the hill I snowboarded past crashed cars and a stuck bus with police there helping them,' Mr Woodward told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'There was so much snow and it was so fun that I climbed up some other roads and snowboarded them too.'</p>

<p>Mr Woodward initially had plans to go to The Remarkables skifield, but the facility was closed due to the strong winds. </p>

<p>When he saw snow up to 30cm at 8am, he knew he had to still take advantage of the show.</p>

<p>He made it close to town but due to warmer roads the snowfall wasn't as thick.  </p>
