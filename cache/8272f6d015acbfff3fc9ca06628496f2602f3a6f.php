<p>The Duke, 36, and Duchess of Sussex, 39, announced earlier this month that they have signed a megawatt Netflix deal said to be worth £112million to make TV series, films and children's shows for the streaming service. </p>

<p>Their first project, which is aimed at a young audience, is in pre-production and has been greenlit by bosses at the media giant.</p>

<p>An industry insider told Vanity Fair's Katie Nicholl: 'There's a lot of buzz about it, it is going ahead and work has started on the series.'</p>

<p>Prince Harry, 36, and Meghan Markle's, 39, first Netflix project which is an animated series about inspiring women is 'creating a lot of buzz in the industry', a source has claimed</p>

<p>Other projects the couple are currently working on include a wildlife documentary series, which could see the Duke and Duchess travel to Africa when global Covid-19 restrictions are lifted. </p>

<p>And future plans include scripted series, docuseries, documentaries, features and children's programming with the couple looking to focus on stories and issues that resonate with them personally.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ingrid Seward said the news the couple won't be making a reality show would come as a relief to the Queen.</p>

<p>The royal expert said it would be 'too much too soon' for the couple to consider a documentary, adding: 'I think they should wait and think long and hard about making anything that is deemed 'personal.' </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussexes's first project, which is aimed at a young audience, is in pre-production and has been greenlit by bosses at the media giant </p>

<p>Earlier this week, the couple were forced to deny plans to to star in a fly-on-the-wall Netflix reality series with cameras following them for three months.</p>

<p>Reports had suggested Harry and Meghan would be followed amid the possibility of cameras being allowed into their home in Montecito, California.  </p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan were said to have been hoping to 'give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do', according to a source. </p>

<p>A source had told The Sun: 'They may have had all these lofty ideas about producing epics highlighting environmental causes and the poverty gap, but Netflix obviously want their pound of flesh.</p>

<p>Meanwhile royal expert Ingrid Seward said the news the couple won't be making a reality show would come as a relief to the Queen</p>

<p>'It will all be very tasteful, and not Katie Price and Peter Andre-style reality TV, but they want to give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do.'</p>

<p>But they added: 'It will still be a fascinating insight and Meghan hopes viewers will get to see the real her.'</p>

<p>But a spokesman for the royal couple insisted earlier this week: 'The Duke and Duchess are not taking part in any reality shows.' </p>

<p>Rumors of Harry and Meghan seeking to gain a foothold in Hollywood have run rampant ever since the couple announced their plans to quit as senior royals, seek financial independence and move to North America in January.</p>

<p>Meghan's first post-Megxit job in showbiz was as a narrator of the Disney Plus docuseries Elephants, which came out in April.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old Los Angeles native nabbed the job after Harry bragged about her voice-over skills to Disney chairman Bob Iger at the London premiere of The Lion King live-action remake last summer.</p>

<p>Harry followed in her footsteps by appearing in a new Netflix documentary about about the Paralympic Games called Rising Phoenix, which aired on August 26.</p>

<p>The decision to work with Netflix is also a move reminiscent of former President Barack Obama and his lawyer wife Michelle. </p>
