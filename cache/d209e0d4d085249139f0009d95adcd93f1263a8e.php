<p>A representative for ITV told MailOnline: 'We are grateful Sam and Billie were able to take time out of their busy schedules to participate in our special anniversary programme....</p>

<p>'They are hugely popular with the viewers and we all enjoyed laughing at old clips and reminiscing about their time on the show. Viewers can join them in celebrating ten years of TOWIE this Sunday on ITVBe at 9pm.'</p>

<p>Sam herself revealed she was returning to film retrospects, as she detailed her contribution to the anniversary after making the U-turn: 'We're not going back on to the show to film as such but we're doing the 10 year anniversary best bits... </p>

<p>Since leaving the show, she has scooped her own reality show, The Mummy Diaries, with her partner Paul Knightley and their kids, Paul, five, and Rosie, two. </p>

<p>Always glam: Despite stepping out for the energetic game, she still wore a full face of makeup</p>

<p>Despite this, the girls sadly fell out when Amy left the show.</p>

<p>In 2011, Sam said of their now-defunct friendship: 'When she was in Celebrity Big Brother I gave her all the support in the world...</p>

<p>'I put her in my column and tweeted about her constantly. But when the last series of TOWIE started I didn't even get a text or a phone call. I feel very let down...</p>

<p>'TOWIE was a massive thing for both of us, and it would only take one phone call to show we're still friends. We're just not close any more and it's sad.'   </p>

<p>Game time: Wearing shorts and a grey top, it wasn't long before Harry took control of the ball</p>

<p>She's got it covered! Ella Rae opted to spread much of her body across the board to guard it</p>

<p>She's having a laugh: She appeared to be getting into the spirit of things as she caught the ball</p>

<p>Powerful kick: She stood by the dartboard in anticipation as Harry ran up for a powerful kick</p>

<p>Reporting for work: Bobby Cole Norris was also spotted shooting scenes for the show, arriving in khaki combat trousers with a black V-neck top</p>

<p>We're back! Meanwhile, TOWIE original Sam Faiers and her sister Billie were seen arriving at the famous Faces nightclub on Friday morning for TOWIE's 10th anniversary</p>

<p>That was then...: Sam's friendship with Amy Childs was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans (pictured with Amy and Kirk Norcross in 2010)</p>
