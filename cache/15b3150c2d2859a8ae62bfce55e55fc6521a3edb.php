<p>He told the camera: 'Just speaking to my daughter live on air, wishing her good luck for her first day back at school, and all her friends.</p>

<p>While his co-host Susanna Reid chimed in: 'Good luck Elise!' </p>

<p>Piers continued: 'She's good a message for Susanna: It's fine to have fun on things like Strictly, but actually, you've got to win. Quite right Elise'.</p>

<p>That's my girl: The broadcaster, 55, took a call from his daughter during the show as he wished her and her friends well as they went back to school</p>

<p>Mock:  Piers jokingly ribbed colleague Susanna Reid, 49, during the call, as he mocked her for stating that it was the taking part that counted in the wake of their co-star Ranvir Singh's Strictly announcement</p>

<p>While fellow presenter Ranvir Singh was heard saying: 'That is so sweet!' </p>

<p>Susanna then referred back to her and Piers' earlier clash over Ranvir's unveiling as a new Strictly Come Dancing contestant which saw Piers insisting that she had to win, while Susanna argued that it was the taking part that counted. </p>

<p>Piers  looked on amused as his youngest child, who he shares with wife Celia Waldon, put on an animated display behind him.</p>

<p>The first photo saw both Elise and Piers smile brightly, before she wagged her finger at him angrily, and then pulled a funny face. </p>

<p>Referring to his Good Morning Britain co-presenter, Piers wrote in the caption: 'Elise modelling her inner Susanna.'</p>
