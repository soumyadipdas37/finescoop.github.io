<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She turned 32 last week, and was surrounded by many of her friends over Labor Day Weekend to celebrate. </p>

<p>It turns out, however, that Ridiculousness star Chanel West Coast may have broken some rules with her gathering, as the Los Angeles Police Department arrived Sunday night to shut the festivities down – either as a result of noise complaints, or the prohibition against large gatherings during the time of COVID-19, or both.</p>

<p>What's more, Chanel was caught on camera yelling at the police, and even calling them 'losers' as seen in a clip.</p>

<p>Wild birthday girl: Chanel West Coast (lower left) may have broken some rules with her birthday gathering this weekend, as the LAPD arrived Sunday night to shut the festivities down</p>

<p>Regardless: The star yelled at police for coming to shut down her party, at first sharing a 'tip' with them about another party down the street; seen in 2019</p>

<p>The Fantasy Factory's Instagram Stories reveal a large gathering with many or most of her guests not wearing face coverings.</p>

<p>The party looks like it began at the pool in the daytime and went well into the night. </p>

<p>According to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, 'Individual and family gatherings or parties of any size aren’t allowed' at present, due to the still-high numbers of coronavirus cases that are keeping California in the red zone in regards to the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>What's more: Chanel was caught on camera yelling at the police, and even calling them 'losers' as seen in a clip</p>

<p>Talking back: 'If you guys really want to break up some chaos that’s gonna cause corona, you should go to the parties that are actually with like extensive amounts of people,' Chanel is heard saying</p>

<p>Regardless, CWC berated the cops for coming to shut down her party, at first sharing a 'tip' with them about another party down the street.</p>

<p>'There's another party up Laurel Canyon off of Mulholland and it has 300 people,' Chanel said, before added that she 'only ha[s] less than' a smaller unintelligible number of guests at her wild shindig.</p>

<p>'So if you guys really want to break up some chaos that’s gonna cause corona, you should go to the parties that are actually with like extensive amounts of people,' the Alcoholic rapper continued. 'I just gave you lots of tips. I’m helping you.' </p>

<p>Not the right time: The Fantasy Factory's Instagram Stories reveal a large gathering that looks to number in the hundreds – with many or most of her guests not wearing face coverings</p>

<p>Then, when the cops tried to diffuse and say they 'appreciate' the star, she replied, 'I love you.'</p>

<p>However, Chanel felt the need to then bring up a painful moment from her past, right there on the street.</p>

<p>'Also, so, my ex-boyfriend was shot and killed when he was 19. That murder is still unsolved,' she informed them, referring to her late former beau Saul Garcia who died by a gunshot wound in 2007. </p>

<p>It's her party and she'll yell if she wants to: This was the bathing suit Chanel wore at her party and when she told off the cops</p>

<p>Cake and confections: The starlet's party looked lavish and expensive, with many revelers</p>

<p>'So if you guys wanna really do something with your lives – you know, you can solve murder mysteries instead of breaking up parties.' </p>

<p>CWC then gave a fake laugh and made her way back up the stairs.</p>

<p>She continued: 'It must feel great breaking up parties instead of solving f<strong><em>ing murder mysteries that have been unsolved for f</em></strong>ing 12 years.' </p>

<p>During her rant: Chanel felt the need to then bring up a painful moment from her past, right there on the street; seen on Instagram</p>

<p>Before turning around and going back inside, she added one final word: 'Losers.'</p>

<p>According to TMZ, Chanel was cited for the party after 11 of her neighbors called the cops.</p>
