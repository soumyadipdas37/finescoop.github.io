<p>The mesmerizing change in colors typically begins in mid to late August when the lush green foliage of the Summer begins to fade and be replaced by hues of red, yellow and orange.</p>

<p>By September and October, the colors of the leaves become more vibrant until they reach their peak brightness. </p>

<p>According to New Hampshire's latest fall foliage report, the White Mountains are nearing their peak conditions.</p>

<p>According to New Hampshire's latest fall foliage report, the White Mountains are nearing their peak conditions</p>

<p>'Colors are really coming to life in the White Mountains, with near-peak conditions being reported in the western towns of Lincoln/Woodstock, Campton/Thornton, and Waterville Valley,' it said. </p>

<p>'The rest of the White Mountains continue to see great color development, although leaf peepers should pay special attention to Franconia Notch, Bretton Woods, and Crawford Notch as these areas are currently displaying incredibly vibrant colors!'</p>

<p>'A scenic drive along Route 49 through Campton should do the trick and will treat you to awe-inspiring views of the colorful foliage in action.' </p>
