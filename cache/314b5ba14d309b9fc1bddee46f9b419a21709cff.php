<p>Tennis legend Boris Becker, pictured last month, is due in court on Thursday amid claims he hid finances during his 2017 bankruptcy hearing</p>

<p>The High Court has imposed restrictions on the Grand Slam winner's finances for the next 11 years, as the Insolvency Service raised concerns over 'undisclosed,' transactions. </p>

<p>It's alleged he hid his stake of shares in AI firm Breaking Data Corp and did not mention bank accounts in Belgium and Guernsey to bankruptcy proceedings. </p>

<p>He allegedly had a flat in Coleherne Court, Chelsea, which went undeclared between June and October 2018, along with two other German properties. </p>

<p>Becker has also been accused of not disclosing a £620,000 debt, hiding a £1.5million sum of money and not declaring bank accounts which were holding £1.2million.  </p>

<p>It's alleged Becker hid his stake of shares in AI firm Breaking Data Corp and did not mention bank accounts in Belgium and Guernsey to bankruptcy proceedings</p>

<p>Last year he agreed to a 12-year Bankruptcy Restrictions Undertaking after the allegations came to light. </p>

<p>In the case, which is being prosecuted by the Insolvency Service, Becker has been charged with ten counts of concealing property from the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, two charges of failing to disclose property, three counts of failing to disclose details of an estate, concealing a debt, and three charges of omission in a statement of affairs by a bankrupt.</p>
