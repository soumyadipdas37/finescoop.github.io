<p>The Monty Python star, 77, said: 'If something is funny and makes people laugh, then I'm afraid that just happens. </p>

<p>'Any attempt by authority to say, "No, you've got to make sure that we're portrayed in a serious manner" is a dangerous thing.</p>

<p>Sir Michael Palin (pictured) has warned of the dangers of telling comedians which jokes they are allowed to make and of PC culture stifling humour</p>

<p>'Everybody, myself included, should be up for being laughed at or joked with.</p>

<p>'Comedy is very important, especially in times of crisis. One needs jokes, one needs laughter. But you shouldn't stifle it by decree.' </p>

<p>However Sir Michael added he objects if comedians try to get 'laughs from bullying and belittling people'.</p>

<p>His comments came ahead of his new BBC series Travels Of A Lifetime starting next Sunday in which he looks back at some of his globe-trotting adventures. </p>

<p>The star, who was knighted last year, said that 'the laughter that Python created was from general silliness. And looking at human behaviour and saying that, 'we're all idiots'.'</p>

<p>Sir Michael said he was relieved that none of the 'fear' he felt when he made his first foray into travel presenting was obvious to viewers.</p>

<p> The Monty Python star, 77, added he objects if comedians try to get 'laughs from bullying and belittling people' (pictured, Michael Palin in Monty Python's Life of Brian)</p>

<p>He was worried, at the time, about whether the show 'would work, would it be a complete disaster and who was going to watch it?,' he admitted.</p>

<p>'Inside, I was full of anxiety and misgivings and worries... about whether I'd be up to it and all that. But looking at them I managed to sort of suppress those, mostly, on camera.</p>

<p>'I was pleased about that. I looked as though I was enjoying myself when in fact it was difficult!'</p>

<p>Michael Palin, Travels Of A Lifetime begins at 8pm on October 4 on BBC Two. </p>
