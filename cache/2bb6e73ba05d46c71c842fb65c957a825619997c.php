<p>Sharing the secret behind her bold look, the media personality added: 'FYI. A boned corset dented the girls all night', alongside a series of fried egg emojis.  </p>

<p>According to a report from The Mirror on Monday, Ofcom received 277 complaints about the programme, with the majority focusing on the former Wild At Heart actress' ensemble.</p>

<p>Her gown featured a sweetheart neckline and was cinched around her svelte waist, teamed with a pair of sparkling silver barely-there heels.</p>

<p>In a snap shared to Instagram, the blonde showcased her toned pins in the chic outfit, which featured a perilously high thigh slit up the leg of the gown. </p>

<p>However at the time, some fans claimed Amanda had suffered a nip slip in the look, and they took to Twitter to question if they'd seen more than they'd bargained for during the show.</p>

<p>One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'</p>

<p>Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'</p>

<p>Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment. </p>

<p>This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show.</p>

<p>While the blonde beauty had also risked a wardrobe malfunction in a cut-out number by Jennifer Clair.</p>

<p>The stunning jewel hued frock featured a cut-out at the bust, threatening to expose her cleavage, as well as a high-high split running up her right leg.</p>

<p>Wow: Last year, Amanda's raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show</p>

<p>Stunning: The TV star (pictured left) first made an impression in a semi-sheer ensemble, while she also risked a wardrobe malfunction when she dared to bare in a cut-out number</p>

<p>She then dared to bare in the revealing, spider web number which attracted the Ofcom complaints.</p>

<p>While the next night she revealed her ample cleavage in a plunging, midnight blue gown, adorned with white floral detail and sequins. </p>

<p>Despite the controversy over her looks, Amanda told You magazine at the time that she was delighted her remarkable figure still attracts attention: 'I love it that people are still talking about my tired old breasts and I'm nearly 50!'</p>

<p>She added: 'No one talks about [BGT co-host] Alesha Dixon's – she's got great boobs by the way – and she's eight years younger than me.</p>

<p>Semi-sheer: The former actress also dared to bare in the revealing, spider web number (pictured) which attracted a number of Ofcom complaints</p>

<p>'Age is totally irrelevant, thanks to people like J-Lo, who is 49 and just a sexy, hot woman who dresses for how she feels.'</p>

<p>Amanda's wardrobe has led to some controversial moments in the past after a daring Julien Macdonald gown she wore during the semi-final of BGT three years ago attracted a staggering 663 Ofcom complaints. </p>

<p>Ofcom said that while it recognised the dress 'had potential to offend some viewers during what is a family show' - the outfit 'would not have exceeded most viewers' expectations'.</p>

<p>And this wasn't the first time risque outfit choices on Britain's Got Talent caused fans to lodge official complaints.</p>

<p>In 2016, Ofcom again decided not to investigate the ITV show after outfits worn by Holden and fellow judge Alesha Dixon sparked 90 complaints from viewers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Diversity's Black Lives Matter inspired performance during the show's first semi-final attracted 24,500 complaints to OfCom, who have since announced they will not investigate any further.</p>

<p>ITV has 'stood with Diversity' as they featured adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial dance. </p>

<p>ITV are believed to have spent around £260,000 on the newspaper ads with full-page monochrome pieces in The Metro costing £36,461 and £27,700 in The Mirror. </p>

<p>Controversy: Meanwhile, Diversity's dance earlier this month sparked 24,500 complaints but  Ofcom have since announced they will not investigate any further</p>

<p>Alesha was one of many who praised ITV for standing by the dance troupe. The singer took to Instagram to share a snap of the advert and gushed over how 'proud' she was with them. </p>

<p>In her caption, she wrote: 'Well done <?php echo e('@'); ?>ITV for standing with Diversity! Proud of you! This image is in all of the national newspapers today.'</p>

<p>Ashley Banjo also shared his gratitude with ITV for standing by Diversity over their Black Lives Matter-inspired performance. </p>

<p>She wore her golden locks in bouncy glamorous curls and and opted for full coat of make-up in neutral tones. </p>

<p>Amanda's pals gushed over the stunning look, as Mollie King wrote: 'Wow looking gorgeous!' and Helen Flanagan left heart emojis underneath. </p>
