<p>Still pals: The actress, 55, uploaded the amusing video of Hugh shaking his stuff in a white shirt and suit trousers to the song Jump (For My Love) by The Pointer Sisters (pictured in 1994)</p>

<p>Hugh looks back on their relationship with fondness and has previously dubbed himself an 'idiot' for the sex scandal as he reflected on their strong bond. </p>

<p>Speaking in a 2018 interview with Jess Cagle, the actor said: 'We’re like brother and sister... I think it’s partly because we went from zero to somewhere together.</p>

<p>'We went through terrible years at the beginning when neither of us had any work, living in a tiny flat. It was quite bonding.' </p>

<p>The Notting Hill star hit headlines when he was arrested over two decades ago in Los Angeles for his actions involving a prostitute named Divine Brown.</p>

<p>She said: 'A belated Happy 60th Birthday to the glorious Hugh Grant - a magnificent addition to the human race- even though he looks like a monkey. ❤️ you forever xxxx'</p>

<p>Hallelujah:  The former duo remain good friends, despite their shocking split in 2000 when the actor was famously caught with a Hollywood prostitute eight years into their romance</p>

<p>He reflected on the fiasco: 'I was just an idiot. I didn’t try to say, "I’ve got this psychological problem." I just said, "I did it"'. </p>

<p>Hugh is now the godfather to Elizabeth's son Damian, 18, who she had with businessman Steve Bing who passed away earlier this year. </p>

<p>Elizabeth suffered a devastating blow when she discovered her ex-partner had jumped from the 27th floor of his Los Angeles apartment building in June. </p>

<p>Their son Damian thanked fans for their 'overwhelming kindness' following his father's suicide. </p>

<p>The student took to Instagram, where he posted a photograph and shared a gratitude-filled caption alongside. The message read: 'I'd like to thank you all again for your kindness over the past few days. </p>

<p>'Your love and support has helped me greatly during this challenging time.' </p>
