<p>A live YouTube webcam showing the toings and froings of sea life in Miami's harbor has become an internet sensation.</p>

<p>The action that it shows takes place just yards from the shore – and some of the creatures that have dropped by to say hello include parrotfish, pufferfish, West Indian manatees, stingrays, nurse sharks, lemon sharks, blacktip sharks, great barracuda and angelfish.</p>

<p>Two grunts - French and white varieties - go mouth to mouth in front of the ever-popular Coral City Camera</p>

<p>Good g-reef: A sleek blacknose shark drops by for a nose around</p>

<p>Called Coral City Camera, it's located next to an 'urban reef' on the north-east tip of PortMiami.</p>

<p>It has been deployed in 10ft of water by Coral Morphologic - creator of innovative underwater media - and streams 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with the footage available on both the Coral City Camera website and YouTube.</p>

<p>And according to the website, 'it makes for a real-life aquarium screensaver you can enjoy all day'.</p>

<p>The best time to log on to the live stream is late afternoon as that seems to be the time of the 'most fish activity.'</p>

<p>But don't despair if you log on and don't see any sea life.</p>

<p>The website adds: 'Fish activity varies over the course of the day, depending on the tide, weather, and water clarity.</p>

<p>'Sometimes, that means that very few fish will be seen, but typically patience will be rewarded, as the fish are rarely far away.'</p>

<p>In addition, the Coral City Camera Instagram and Twitter pages post short highlight videos, with recent clips showing 'a nurse shark flying in from above', a gliding stingray and an 'adorable little cutie of a smooth trunkfish'.</p>

<p>The camera, which went live in February, was deployed as a 'hybrid art-science research project' and to give people a glimpse at the 'urban marine ecosystem' around the shores of Miami.</p>

<p>It explains: 'The project was launched with the idea that the incredible biodiversity living just below the waterline in Miami should be a point of civic pride that engages the public to protect what they know and love.'</p>
