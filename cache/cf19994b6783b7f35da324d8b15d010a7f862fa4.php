<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian deportee has been caught trying to escape hotel quarantine after using bed sheets as a rope to climb out of a window and abseil down the building. </p>

<p>The man was staying at a Ramada Hotel in Auckland, New Zealand when he decided to make a break for it on Monday, despite being due for release in two days.</p>

<p>He tied bed sheets together to create a rope and managed to scale down four storeys. </p>

<p>The man was staying at a Ramada Hotel in Auckland, New Zealand (pictured) when he decided to make a break for it on Monday, despite being due for release in two days</p>

<p>But he was caught by on-site security as he made his way out of the front gate.</p>

<p>He was taken into custody by police.</p>

<p>'So far, we have been unable to establish what time the man absconded the facility,' Darryn Webb, head of managed isolation and quarantine, said. </p>

<p>CCTV footage will be reviewed to establish he man's movements, he said.</p>

<p>'This person has put themselves and others at potential risk and their actions were unacceptable. Wilfully leaving our facilities will not be tolerated, and the appropriate action will be taken.'</p>

<p>Mr Webb said the COVID-19 risk to the public was low.</p>

<p>He tied bed sheets together to create a rope and managed to scale down four storeys (stock image pictured)</p>

<p>Security at the facility has been increased since the escape attempt. </p>

<p>New Zealand has a 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine scheme for anyone entering the country.</p>

<p>About 55,000 people have gone through the hotel quarantine scheme and 13 breaches have been reported.</p>

<p>'These incidents are rare, and we treat them extremely seriously,' Mr Webb said. </p>
