<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury has demanded Prime Minister Boris Johnson visit Morecambe to combat racism towards travellers.</p>

<p>The British boxing superstar led a march through his hometown to different pubs which he claims are 'racist' and 'banning travellers'.  </p>

<p>The 32-year-old posted a video of a protest march in Morecambe and Lancaster on Twitter on Wednesday evening along with the message, 'It's NOT OK to be racist to travellers'.  </p>

<p>World heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury led a march through Morecambe </p>

<p>The crowd were chanting 'traveller's lives matter' as they marched to different pubs</p>

<p>Fury is proud of his heritage and fights under the nickname 'Gypsy King' in the ring </p>

<p>In the video, Fury says: 'I call out the Prime Minister. Where are you? You need to come to Morecambe and out the racists. Boris, where are you Boris? </p>

<p>'It's not OK to be racist to travellers. It's not acceptable.'</p>

<p>The video shows protestors chanting 'TLM' – Travellers' Lives Matter – and wearing t-shirts and carrying banners emblazoned with the message 'TLM for everyone'.</p>

<p>In an earlier clip, the boxer, who has traveller heritage and is nicknamed 'the Gypsy King' says: 'Here I am, here in Lancaster. </p>

<p>'There is a protest going on, Travellers' Lives Matter. There shouldn't be racism towards travellers in 2020.'    </p>

<p>Fury appeared to be at the front of the crowd of people, leading them to different pubs</p>

<p>Fury called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to get involved and combat 'racist' treatment</p>

<p>Wearing a WBC cap, Fury appeared to be the ringleader of the group and lead them to different locations. </p>

<p>Many of the protesters held signs, wore specially made t-shirts for the protest and also had face coverings, although there did not appear to be any social distancing. </p>

<p>Some of the crowd had their masks pulled down or placed beneath their noses.</p>

<p>It seems the group borrowed their slogan directly from Black Lives Matter (BLM), the movement that has gathered incredible global momentum since the killing of George Floyd by police in Minnesota.</p>

<p>Fury is seen regularly in his local community of Morcambe and maintains a similar lifestyle to the one he has always had, despite earning millions in his undefeated boxing career.  </p>
