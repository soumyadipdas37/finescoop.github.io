<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A couple forced to flee an Oregon town because of raging wildfires watched on helplessly as looters ransacked their evacuated home - just days after firefighters spared it from the blaze.</p>

<p>Tracy and Marvin Johnson, who live in the unincorporated hamlet of Beavercreek in Clackamas County, recalled for KION 6 News how they watched the robbery unfold on their doorbell camera.</p>

<p>The couple had evacuated just days earlier as the Unger Fire moved in. The blaze had already destroyed a two-mile hiking trail in the town that they had opened days earlier after spending eight years building it.  </p>

<p>Firefighters managed to save their home despite the fire coming within feet of the property.</p>

<p>But their relief quickly turned to heartbreak when they received an alert from their security camera about movement outside of their home days later. </p>

<p>‘Our Nest cam came on and told us that there was movement and we could see the lights pull up into our driveway,’ Marvin Johnson said. ‘We saw the door open and could hear people inside the house talking.’ </p>

<p>Tracy and Marvin Johnson, who live in the unincorporated hamlet of Beavercreek in Clackamas County recalled for KION 6 News how they were forced to watch on helplessly as looters ransacked their home shortly after they evacuated</p>

<p>Firefighters managed to save their home despite the blaze coming within feet of it, but days after, despite an evacuation order in the area, looters broke in</p>

<p>The couple watched on a live feed from their cellphones as a group of thieves broke into their home.</p>

<p>They called the police but by the time officers arrived, the suspects had already fled the home.</p>

<p>Thankfully the thieves didn’t appear to take off with too much, the couple said. Despite the break-in, the Johnsons said they’re grateful just to have a home to come back to. </p>

<p>A string of looting-related arrests have been made across the state as dozens of wildfires continue to rage.</p>

<p>Disaster relief personnel say the looting spree is having a damaging ripple effect across as residents try desperately to evacuate from active fire fronts and with law enforcement staffing already in short supply.</p>

<p>With more than half a million people forced to vacate their properties across Oregon, the state is seen as especially vulnerable. So far more than 1,400 homes have been destroyed and 10 people have died. </p>

<p>The escalating tensions and fear of crime have seen local residents begin posting signs bearing slogans like, ‘You loot, we shoot’ outside of their homes.</p>

<p>‘Criminals are also making bogus 911 calls to divert patrols away from evacuated neighborhoods,’ a law enforcement official told Fox News. ‘Now we are seeing armed homeowners and civilians coming back into evacuated areas and trying to enforce the law in their own hands.’</p>

<p>Residents across the state have reportedly began setting up their own checkpoints and are said to be illegally stopping ‘unfamiliar’ vehicles at gunpoint.</p>

<p>Clackamas County Sheriff Craig Roberts told reporters earlier this week that his agency has responded to more than 330 calls for service over the past week – a 400 percent increase from the week before.</p>

<p>‘We have a group of different individuals that are actually trying to protect property. They actually have been armed and are stopping individuals within the commune out there,’ Roberts said. ‘First thing I’d ask them to do is please stop that. We have reached out to a number of them. If they see somebody suspicious, call us. Let us handle it. It is illegal to stop somebody at gunpoint.’ </p>

<p>Police have reportedly so far made 13 arrests in the evacuation areas of the county, including some for burglary, criminal trespass and possession of burglary tools.</p>

<p>Police in Oregon have arrested a string of suspected looters during the ongoing wildfires, as cops claim the criminals are making bogus 911 calls to divert officers elsewhere</p>

<p>More than 300 miles away in Jackson County, police were conducting an anti-looting patrol in Medford when they came across homes along South Pacific Highway that appeared to have been burglarized.</p>

<p>Two fires, the Almeda fire and South Obenchain fire, are threatening the area and mass evacuations have taken place.</p>

<p>Upon further investigation, officers located stashes of what appeared to be stolen property in bushes along Bear Creek Greenway, the Mail Tribune reported.</p>

<p>Officers observed the apparent stash site from a distance and a group of five men all with outstanding warrants for their arrest returned to the site, police said.</p>

<p>The suspects allegedly hid stolen property, including video game consoles, in the bushes and in homeless camps along the Greenway.</p>

<p>Three of the men; Jason Paul Gibbs, 34, Cameryn Mykal Geiger, 29, and Manuel Jarome Parks, 43; were arrested on burglary and theft charges relating to a suspected looting spree in the Medford Estates area. They’re each being held in the Jackson County Jail on bail of at least $100,000.</p>

<p>Christopher Headrick, 41, was arrested on charges of third-degree theft and possession of methamphetamine, while Kevin Patrick Smith, 39, was arrested on a parole violation from a past meth possession case during the incident.</p>

<p>The escalating tensions and fear of crime have seen local residents begin posting signs bearing slogans like, ‘You loot, we shoot’ outside of their homes</p>

<p>On September 9, the day after the Almeda fire first broke out, a witness called police to say a man was trying to pry open a safe in a burned house on nearby North Rose Street.</p>

<p>The man claimed to live there, but when asked by the witness, he didn’t know the address of the house, according to a probable cause affidavit.</p>

<p>Medford police arrived and found Kyle Delaney Mahan, 28, in possession of several knives and four checks addressed to a resident of the street, police said.</p>

<p>‘Mahan told me he was only curious and was poking at the safe to see if it would open,’ an officer wrote in the affidavit, according to the Mail Tribune.</p>

<p>Mahan is currently being detained in Jackson County Circuit Court on first-degree burglary, second-degree burglary, first-degree criminal trespassing and two counts of first-degree theft. His bail is set at $50,000.</p>

<p>Police say they’re also investigating numerous incidents of looting in areas threatened by the South Obechain fire between Butte Falls and Shady Cove to the north of Jackson County.</p>

<p>On Friday, Jackson County Sheriff’s Office deputies responded to reports of two suspicious men walking around Rogue River Drive and Highway 62 in Shady Cove – which was under a level 3 evacuation order at the time.</p>

<p>Police later located two men in a truck at Walmart with a truckload of stolen property, police said.</p>

<p>Ricky Lee Davis, 39, and Christopher Eugene Stegeman, 32, were both arrested at the scene on burglary charges.</p>

<p>Davis had a revolver concealed on his hip at the time of his arrest. He was issued additional charges of felon in possession of a firearm and unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>

<p>A day earlier, in the same neighborhood, Jackson County Sheriff’s Office deputies were flagged down regarding possible looting.</p>

<p>A witness saw a woman enter a Shady Cove home, then place several backpacks outside, while a male accomplice loaded the bags into a car.</p>

<p>The vehicle sped away from the scene, but police later located the vehicle and found the backpacks had been hidden in nearby bushes.</p>

<p>Katrina Lathrop, 35, also known as Katrina Diehl, and Reed Montgomery Tardif, 25, were both charged with first-degree theft and first-degree burglary.</p>

<p>On the same day, Paydyn Dineen, 28, was arrested on charges of aggravated theft and second-degree burglary.</p>

<p>His arrest came after deputies responded to multiple reports of a suspicious man driving at a high rate of speed on an ATV.</p>

<p>They located Dineen and the ATV, and found it had been stolen from an evacuated residence, according to the sheriff’s office.</p>
