<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andy Cole and Darren Fletcher have heaped praise on Dean Henderson after his stellar performance saw Manchester United triumph over Brighton. </p>

<p>Henderson executed an outstanding one-handed save to deny Leandro Trossard and preserve his second clean sheet for United as they won 3-0. </p>

<p>Such a performance would have left David De Gea sitting uncomfortably as his competitor closes in on his position as first-choice goalkeeper. </p>

<p>Andy Cole and Darren Fletcher have heaped praise on Manchester United's Dean Henderson</p>

<p>Speaking of Henderson's performance, Cole said: 'Very good again. We have spoken about it previously, playing in goal for Manchester United is not easy, especially when United are playing well because you’re not really called upon but when he has been called upon this evening, he has made two real good saves.'  </p>

<p>'He has definitely impressed me when he has been given the opportunity in goal.' </p>

<p>Darren Fletcher agreed, saying: 'This is a fantastic save, and this is at 1-0. It keeps them right in the game, Trossard thinks he has scored there. </p>

<p>'He stays up big, gets a strong hand to it, puts it past the post. He did the exact same thing against Luton.</p>

<p>'United were struggling a little bit and Luton had a header at the back post and he made a fantastic save. </p>

<p>Henderson executed an outstanding one-handed save to deny Brighton's Leandro Trossard</p>

<p>Henderson is putting pressure on David De Gea and  his position as first-choice goalkeeper</p>

<p>'We spoke then as well, you expect to make saves at Sheffield United with all due respect but at Manchester United, he’s made two great saves tonight, and he has been there and he has been counted upon. </p>

<p>'That could have easily been 1-1, confidence goes down, Brighton come back into the game. But off the back of that, the rest of the team say we’ve got away with one there and then they go on and win 3-0 and it’s a comfortable victory.'</p>

<p>After come through the United academy, Henderson made his United debut in the 3-0 win over Luton in the Carabao Cup last week. </p>

<p>Having produced another impressive performance against a Premier League opposition, Henderson is pushing to overtake David De Gea as the first choice keeper. </p>

<p>When asked if he thought Henderson could replace De Gea between the sticks, Cole said: 'I think De Gea is in a little bit of credit from his previous seasons at Manchester United.</p>

<p>'I think it is more what he doesn’t do. If he has a bit of a season like he did last season, I think Henderson will definitely get his opportunity.</p>

<p>'Henderson has proven to everyone that he is a very good goalkeeper, and De Gea is going to have a battle on to stay as No 1 for Manchester United.' </p>
