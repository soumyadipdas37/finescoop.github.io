<p>Jaimi's younger brother Jett penned his own somber tribute on Sunday, reflecting on the good times the close family had with his 'biggest sister'.</p>

<p>'You were there whenever I needed you, you taught me how to cook gourmet food like roast potatoes, chicken and salad, and tacos - the essentials in our household,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'You gave me a slight insight into fashion by dressing me in up in dresses and putting makeup on me when I was young. You'd sit behind me while I ate dinner and would pick at anything pimple looking on my back - even if it was just a mole.</p>

<p>'You were there whenever I needed you': Jaimi's younger brother Jett (L) penned his own somber tribute on Sunday following the funeral, reflecting on the good times the close family with his 'biggest sister'</p>

<p>'You were my second mother, you were my biggest sister, you were my friend, and you were a fighter until the very end.</p>

<p>'Jaimi, I will love you forever and you will always have a place in my heart. I will miss you dearly, but cherish the moments we had together greatly. I love you so much, and I will see you again at some point.'</p>

<p>Jett also reflected on the funeral, thanking the people who were able to attend and those who couldn't due to Queensland's gathering limit due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>Support: Family and friends of Jaimi were seen embracing each other at the conclusion of the heartbreaking funeral service</p>

<p>On Friday night, Morgan's husband Ryan thanked the local community for their support and outpouring of love in the days since Jaimi's death.   </p>

<p>'Thank you to everyone who has reached out and offered kind words, gifts, support and love to Jaimi's family and I. The condolences are so welcome and helpful,' he wrote alongside a photo with bouquets of flowers.</p>

<p>'We have been sharing the messages with each other and although we may not have been able to offer a response we have received the love from all of it and are very appreciative. </p>

<p>'Jaimi was so very loved and will be so very missed but the love we all share for her will keep her memory alive.'</p>
