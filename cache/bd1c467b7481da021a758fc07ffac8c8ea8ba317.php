<p>Just 24 minutes into the tournament at Roland Garros, Azarenka and her opponent Danka Kovinic were forced to take shelter under umbrellas as a mist of rain, strong winds and cold temperatures disrupted their game. </p>

<p>Azarenka, who began the game wearing a coat, was left sitting in 'freezing' temperatures as officials decided how to proceed amid such conditions.  </p>

<p>Former No.1 Victoria Azarenka vented her frustration at being left to freeze at the French Open</p>

<p>'You guys are joking right? You don’t see what is happening? What are we doing here?', she said to tournament official Claire Wood.</p>

<p>Wood tried to reassure Azarenka, saying she understood how bad the conditions were but had hoped to get the match back under way.</p>

<p>Just 24 minutes in, Azarenka and her opponent Danka Kovinic were sidelined due to conditions</p>

<p>Azarenka was frustrated that they were left to 'freeze' while they waited for further instruction</p>

<p>Azarenka was quick to respond, saying: 'You do know but you guys are not playing so you have no idea about how the conditions are.</p>

<p>'I’m down to play whatever, you know I am not complaining here but you know this is getting a little bit ridiculous. </p>

<p>Wood, who was waiting for further instruction from the tournament referee, asked Azarenka to wait on court to see if the rain would pass. </p>

<p>However, the two-time Australian Open champion had little patience and refused to sit in such conditions. </p>

<p>She said: 'I’m not sitting here because I’m going to get frozen. </p>

<p>'No, I’m not waiting here a couple of minutes because I’m cold. It’s eight degrees... I live in Florida, I’m used to hot weather.' </p>

<p>Continuing to highlight her frustrations, Azarenka asked Kovinic if she was happy to sit on the court as they await further instruction. Her opponent replied 'no'. </p>

<p>As a result, both players walked off the court before they were technically allowed to do so. </p>
