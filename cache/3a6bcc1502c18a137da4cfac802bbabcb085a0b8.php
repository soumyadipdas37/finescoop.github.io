<p>She's back! Daytime Emmy Award-winning host Kelly Clarkson kicked off season two of her talk show on Monday by singing a feel-good medley of sitcom theme songs alongside Full House alum Bob Saget (L)</p>

<p>'One thing you should always remember is you are never alone,' Bob told Clarkson as Danny. 'You have so many people who love and care about you, including me.'</p>

<p>Saget then joined the original American Idol champ - and her three-octave soprano pipes - on her popular 'Kellyoke' segment by belting the theme song from The Mary Tyler Moore Show.</p>

<p>Among the virtual audience members were Ed Asner from The Mary Tyler Moore Show, George Wendt and John Ratzenberger from Cheers, and Dave Coulier and Jodie Sweetin from Full House.</p>

<p>'Let's just get this out of the way. 2020 has been a dumpster fire. Yup just all the words that I can't say on this show just piled together and it's on fire. That's really what it's felt like,' Kelly later explained.</p>

<p>'I wanted to sing those classic TV songs, because in hard times when we're separated, it's the nostalgic moments with family and friends that hold us together.'</p>

<p>Clarkson then addressed how she legally separated from her manager-turned-husband Brandon Blackstock on June 4 after seven years of marriage saying cryptically: 'Definitely didn't see anything coming that came.'</p>

<p>'What I'm dealing with is hard because it involves more than just my heart. It involves a lot of little hearts. We have four kids,' the three-time Grammy winner explained.</p>

<p>'Divorce is never easy. We're both from divorced families so we know the best thing is to protect our children and their little hearts. So, I'm usually very open and I ususally talk about everything. But in this case, I will talk a little bit here and there about how it affects me personally.</p>
