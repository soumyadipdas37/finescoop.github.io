<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Yorkshire have confirmed the signing of England off-spinner Dom Bess, a move exclusively revealed by Sportsmail last week.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old, who spent two temporary spells at Headingley in 2019, returns permanently on a four-year deal after rejecting a new contract offer from Somerset.</p>

<p>Bess, who has made eight of his 10 career Test appearances in 2020, could yet make his farewell appearance in the Bob Willis Trophy final later this month - with Somerset well positioned to top the midlands group and qualify - before re-locating north ahead of next summer.</p>

<p>Yorkshire have confirmed the signing of England off-spinner Dom Bess from Somerset</p>

<p>'Hopefully, the opportunities I can get at Yorkshire will develop my learning to kick on and play international cricket for a long time,' Bess said.</p>

<p>'That is the ultimate goal, but I also want to be part of a Yorkshire side that are again winning championships.</p>

<p>'I want us to be pushing for one day and T20 success as well. Last year, I certainly got the hint that the club want to push for the T20 and 50 over competition.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old, who spent two temporary spells at Headingley, returns on a four-year deal</p>

<p>'I think that it is a great opportunity for me to develop my white-ball skills and show that I'm a three-dimensional player.'</p>

<p>Martyn Moxon, Yorkshire's director of cricket, said: 'Dom has shown his quality and potential this year with England, and made a huge impression at Yorkshire during his loan spell last season.</p>

<p>'His signing will bolster our spin options but will also give us more batting depth down the order.'</p>

<p>Bess follows fast bowler Jamie Overton, who is Surrey-bound, in opting for a new challenge from 2021 onwards.</p>
