<p>Hitting back: Megan Thee Stallion's team is hitting back at Tory Lanez after he tastelessly exploited the shooting allegations against him to promote his new album</p>

<p>Smear campaign: The WAP artist's lawyers have accused Lanez of launching a smear campaign against her, after she publicly named him as her shooter last month (pictured in November, 2018)</p>

<p>Her attorney Alex Spiro told Page Six: 'We have been made aware of manipulated text messages and invented email accounts that have been disseminated to the media in a calculated attempt to peddle a false narrative about the events that occurred on July the 12th. A smear campaign can’t change the truth.'</p>

<p>Lanez's reps subsequently responded: 'The only commentary which has been made on this topic was the creative output on the album. We are investigating who could be sending these false emails and intend to take action against them.' </p>

<p>One of said emails from September 14 included an interview with his alleged bodyguard Zyir Brown, who vouched for the Jerry Sprunger rapper, 28.</p>

<p>Brown said in the Instagram video: 'Tory never reacted like how the media is portraying him to act. I’ve never seen him do that. </p>

<p>False narrative: Her attorney Alex Spiro told Page Six: 'We have been made aware of manipulated text messages and invented email accounts that have been disseminated to the media in a calculated attempt to peddle a false narrative about the events that occurred on July the 12th. A smear campaign can’t change the truth'</p>

<p>Under investigation: Lanez's reps subsequently responded: 'The only commentary which has been made on this topic was the creative output on the album. We are investigating who could be sending these false emails and intend to take action against them' (pictured in December, 2018)</p>

<p>Tasteless album: It comes after he released his fifth studio album Daystar, in which he suggests he's innocent and is being 'framed' by Megan, 25</p>

<p>'I’ve never seen him do anything physical to a woman. I’ve never seen that… I have never ever seen Tory scream at a female.'</p>

<p>Another email sent September 18 from an alleged LIV Nightclub promoter (although the email address did not match LIV employees), claimed Megan's team contacted them to get in touch with Chris Prince, who filed a lawsuit against Lanez after an alleged assault at the venue. </p>

<p>There was also an email sent on September 17, which claimed to have texts between Megan and Lanez, but both rappers have confirmed the messages were doctored. </p>

<p>Although his team has denied sending the emails, Hot Girl Meg's attorney's are accusing Lanez, as the correspondence appears to paint him in a more favorable light.</p>

<p>It comes after he released his fifth studio album Daystar, in which he suggests he's innocent and is being 'framed' by Megan, 25. </p>

<p>In the project's first track Money Over Fallouts, he sings: 'Megan people trying to frame me for a shooting / But them boys ain't clean enough.'</p>

<p>He continues: 'Girl, you had the nerve to write that statement on that affidavit / Knowing I ain't do it but I'm coming at my truest.</p>

<p>Much criticism: He's since faced much criticism from fellow artists, including Rick Ross, who called out Lanez on his Instagram Story</p>

<p>Poor choice: Ross said: 'We got to respect these sisters. That ain't how you address the accusations you facing with the sister. That was a poor choice, homie. You ain't getting no money with that s***'</p>

<p>'And I thought you was solid too, but look at how you doing me / Look at how you doing me, people trying to ruin me.'</p>

<p>Lanez references the shooting several other times on the 17-track album, including in the songs Look How God Works, Sorry But I Had To..., Queen And Slim and It Was Good Until It Wasn't. </p>

<p>He's since faced much criticism from fellow artists, including Rick Ross, who called out Lanez on his Instagram Story.</p>

<p>The Money Dance artist said: 'Torey Lanez, poor decision brother, dropping that project. Just out of respect for Breonna Taylor. Just out of respect for Breonna Taylor, brother.'</p>

<p>He stood behind some strategically-placed bottles of Belaire Rosé, tagging the company, as he mentioned Taylor, the Black woman killed in her sleep by Louisville police officers, who recently avoided charges over her death.</p>

<p>Ross continued: 'We got to respect these sisters. That ain't how you address the accusations you facing with the sister. That was a poor choice, homie. You ain't getting no money with that s***.'</p>

<p>Lanez later hit back on Twitter: 'I respect u 2 much as a black man to disrespect you in these times,however I went out and marched 9 DAYS STRAIT for Breonna Taylor ..IN YOUR CITY ...I didn’t see the “boss” out there once ?...also stop tagging your endorsements in post about her . It’s a poor decision <?php echo e('@'); ?>RickRoss'</p>

<p>Megan addressed Lanez for the first time since the shooting, last month during an Instagram Live: 'You shot me. And you got your publicist and your people going to these blogs lying and s***. Stop lying. Why lie? I don't understand.'</p>
