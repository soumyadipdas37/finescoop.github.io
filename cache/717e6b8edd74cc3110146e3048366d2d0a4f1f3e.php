<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lindy Rama-Ellis (formerly Klim) went from an Olympian's ex-wife to Australia's hottest 'intimate wellness' expert overnight, following the launch of her vagina mask brand Fig Femme in July. </p>

<p>Touted as the 'ultimate pampering product', the masks claim to reduce vulva 'wrinkles', produce 'better textures' and even soothe ailments such as itchiness and acne. </p>

<p>And while Lindy has urged fans to take 'vaginal hydration' seriously, Australian sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein thinks otherwise. </p>

<p>'Consult a doctor, not a beauty brand:' Leading sexologist Dr Nikki Goldstein (pictured) has slammed Lindy Klim's new vagina mask range Fig Femme - which claims to 'improve the appearance of genitals' and treat itchiness</p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Nikki argued that gynaecological problems should always be dealt with by medically-trained professionals, not 'intimate wellness' companies.  </p>

<p>'If there is something that doesn't feel or seem right, it's a doctor that needs to be consulted, not a beauty brand,' she said. </p>

<p>Nikki also suggested that 'intimate' beauty products are problematic because they suggest that there is something inherently wrong with a natural-looking vagina.  </p>

<p>Doctor knows best: Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Nikki said that gynaecological problems should always be dealt with by medically-trained professionals - not wellness brands. Pictured: Lindy Klim </p>

<p>'Women need to be educated on how to keep their vulvas healthy, not given another so called wellness product,' she said.  </p>

<p>'Whilst I encourage more open and positive talk about women's sexuality and their bodies, I am concerned that vulva masks might make many women feel more self conscious about this part of their bodies, [and making women believe] there is now something they need to do to improve it,' she warned.    </p>

<p>'It's ok to have blemishes on your vulva. We should be getting to the point of embracing our vulvas just the way they are and focusing on keeping them healthy, not 'improving' their appearance,' she added. </p>

<p>Controversial: Lindy went from an Olympian's ex-wife to Australia's hottest vaginal wellness expert overnight, following the launch of her vagina mask brand Fig Femme in July </p>

<p>However, a Fig Femme spokesperson has rejected Nikki's assertions, telling Daily Mail Australia that the vulva masks are meant to 'empower' women.  </p>

<p>'The purpose of our masks is to nourish, soothe and aid post-pregnancy recovery, whilst also encouraging an open and honest self-care routine that helps facilitate self-confidence and aid a sense of empowerment for women over their own body,' they said. </p>

<p>'Many women do experience irritation and blemishes down there due to waxing, laser hair removal, exercise and everyday life. Our masks help soothe, restore and protect the skin.' </p>

<p>'It's ok to have blemishes on your vulva': Nikki also suggested that 'intimate' beauty products are problematic because they suggest that there is something inherently wrong with a natural-looking vagina</p>

<p>Despite this, Nikki believes that Lindy's yet another example of a beauty brand profiting from women's insecurities. </p>

<p>'Women need to be educated on how to keep their vulvas healthy, not given another so called wellness product,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>

<p>'Whilst I encourage more open and positive talk about women's sexuality and their bodies, I am concerned that vulva masks might make many women feel more self conscious about this part of their bodies, [and making women believe] there is now something they need to do to improve it,' she warned. </p>

<p>FigFemme's spokesperson has meanwhile rejected Nikki's suggestion that the masks are a way to profit from female insecurities.  </p>

<p>'We are proud of our progressive product and we take pride in encouraging an open and honest dialogue, promoting female self-confidence, breaking down the typical taboo connotations associated with the notion of vulva shame and any female insecurities,' the spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'At FIG Femme, we are not recreating the wheel, there are already female intimate products out there but they seem to be hidden at the back of bathroom cabinets or the bottom of the shopping basket.' </p>

<p>'We wanted to create a range of products that women could feel confident to purchase - because why shouldn’t they?' they added.  </p>

<p>Unique: Each single-use mask costs $25, and is imbued with a variety of 'natural' ingredients, including a probiotic called Lactobacillus ferment to 'reduce odour, irritation and itching'. </p>
