<p>The media personality also detailed his relationship with his stepson: 'Freddie is a little legend. He's like my best mate. I met him when he was four, but I don't say that I'm his dad because I'm not and he's already got a really great dad. He's got me used to being around kids and it will be so nice to have my own child, too.'</p>
