<p>Red wine erupts from a 50,000-litre tank at the Bodegas Vitivinos winery in Villamalea, Spain</p>

<p>A sea of red soon covers the entire area as it spreads out underneath vehicles parked nearby.</p>

<p>Winery workers can only watch helplessly as the thousands of litres of wine slowly drain away into a nearby field.</p>

<p>Local media has reported that a break in one of the vats may have caused the wine to break free of the tank.</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached Bodegas Vitivino for comment. </p>

<p>The video was originally shared on social media yesterday and has been liked almost 38,000 times and has been retweeted more than 9,000 times.</p>

<p>Bodegas Vitivinos was founded in 1969, with a production of 6,000,000 kilos of grapes.</p>

<p>Their facilities are currently run under the supervision of Dr. José P. Gracia.</p>

<p>The vast quantity of red wine seen pouring from the tank drew comparisons to the film The Shining from people on Twitter.</p>

<p>One scene in the film has a wave of blood come crashing out of a lift and flood a hotel corridor.  </p>
