<p>'Gutted': Billie Faiers and Greg Shepherd are left gutted on Thursday's episode of The Mummy Diaries after their planning permission is denied by Brentwood Borough Council</p>

<p>Talking to the camera in a behind-the-scenes clip, Billie says: 'We just feel absolutely gutted don't we. I didn't think I would feel as upset about it as I do.</p>

<p>'It's on my mind, I just can't get it out of my head, I just feel like all the plans we made have been shattered... I know it sounds dramatic, but that's just how I feel.'</p>

<p>To which Greg adds: 'It's now going to go on for months and months. We don't know where we stand really at the minute.'</p>

<p>Dream home plans: The former TOWIE star, 30, and her spouse, 35, purchased a run down 1920s property earlier this year and had dreamed of turning it into a five-bedroom £1.4 million dream home over a planned year and a half long project</p>

<p>'Shattered': Yet on Thursday's episode, Billie and Greg discover their plans have been 'shattered' as their planning permission has been denied by Brentwood Borough Council in Essex</p>

<p>Billie's mother, Suzie Wells, asks if they've spoke to the architect, to which she reveals: 'I haven't, he has! Every time I try to ask him...'</p>

<p>To which Greg argues: 'You've got his number, ring him!' </p>

<p>Suzie then asks her son-in-law what exactly the architect said, to which he explains: 'He said the house, it's just a straight no, there's no report. The house is too big and bold for the street. We've got to arrange a meeting with him and take it from there.'</p>

<p>He then makes a dig at wife Billie and says: 'You just ring him, as you're there sitting on your high horse!' </p>

<p>Sad: Talking to the camera in a behind-the-scenes clip, Billie says: 'We just feel absolutely gutted don't we. I didn't think I would feel as upset about it as I do' with Greg adding: 'It's now going to go on for months and months!' </p>

<p>Shock: The episode also shows the moment Billie and Greg first find out about their failed planning permission</p>

<p>With Suzie diffusing the situation by complaining: 'There's no point in you two getting all stressed with each other.'</p>

<p>Yet Greg continues to rant: 'I sent you his number straight away, if you want to ask him a question, ask him a question... instead of sitting there and going, "urghhh", you don't even ring him!'</p>

<p>Billie insists she will call the architect and says: 'It's just so annoying when you've got your heart set on that. </p>

<p>'Also, it's just dragged on for so long, if we had known this from the beginning, we probably wouldn't have started building.'</p>

<p>Tense: Billie and Greg argue as she won't ring the architect despite him giving her his number </p>

<p>Calm down! With Suzie diffusing the situation by complaining: 'There's no point in you two getting all stressed with each other.'</p>

<p>To which Greg adds: 'No, if we had known from the beginning, we wouldn't have bought it!'  </p>

<p>Yet despite their woes, which were filmed earlier this year, the couple have since received a green light on their dream home after reducing the building by a matter of centimetres.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Billie shared a picture of toasting a glass of wine with Greg to their home Instagram account called 'homewiththesheps'. </p>

<p>She wrote: 'We are so excited that we can FINALLY announce that our Planning Permission has been APPROVED ✔️❤️ </p>

<p>Annoyed: Yet Greg continues to rant: 'I sent you his number straight away, if you want to ask him a question, ask him a question... instead of sitting there and going, "urghhh", you don't even ring him!'</p>

<p>'I know we have been extremely quiet on here due to waiting for the permission, but we can now look forward to sharing lots of updates with you all on our huge renovation project ❤️.'</p>

<p>It came after it was reported that Billie and Greg  had to make a number of changes and compromises for neighbours to finally 'accept' their plans.</p>

<p>The official notice stated that 'in pursuance of the powers conferred on them' the couple would be permitted to carry out specific work.  </p>

<p>According to The Sun, this would allow them to demolish the existing garage to build a two-storey side extension.</p>

<p>Hooray: Yet despite their woes, which were filmed earlier this year, the couple have since received a green light on their dream home after reducing the building by a matter of centimetres </p>

<p>Over the moon: Earlier this month, Billie shared a picture of toasting a glass of wine with Greg to their home Instagram account called 'homewiththesheps'</p>

<p>Additionally, they would be able to demolish the existing conservatory in order to build a single-storey rear extension.</p>

<p>The luxury mansion would also be complete with an in-and-out driveway along with a single-storey front extension and landscape work. </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted Billie and Greg's representative for comment at the time.   </p>

<p>The Mummy Diaries stars, who are parents to six-year-old Nelly and Arthur, three, have been battling with their neighbours for months over their renovations plans. </p>

<p>However, after reducing the building by a matter of centimetres, renovations were given the green light.  </p>

<p>Potential: It came after it was reported that Billie and Greg had to make a number of changes and compromises for neighbours to finally 'accept' their plans</p>

<p>Among the changes that were in the revised plan were to make the height of the planned extension 50 centimetres lower and to ensure their home is further from their neighbours.  </p>

<p>In their latest submission, Billie and Greg are quoted as saying: 'The planning officer confirmed that these now overcome the reasons for refusal on the original application. They therefore recommended that a revised application be submitted.' </p>

<p>In a previous rejection response from the council officer's report it was written of the potential house: 'It would be the biggest house on the street and the increase in size from the original home would not be acceptable.' </p>

<p>The reports also had concerns about whether the home would be sympathetic to the local area.   </p>

<p>The decision notice stated: 'The proposed extensions when combined would create a development which is excessive in terms of bulk, size, massing, roof design and siting, resulting in overly dominant additions to the existing dwelling and a substantial building out of character and appearance within its context.</p>

<p>'It would unacceptably reduce the spatial quality between properties which is characteristic of the area, to the detriment of local visual amenity.' </p>

<p>The Mummy Diaries continues at 9pm on ITVBe. </p>

<p>Green light: The official notice stated that 'in pursuance of the powers conferred on them' the couple would be permitted to carry out specific work </p>
