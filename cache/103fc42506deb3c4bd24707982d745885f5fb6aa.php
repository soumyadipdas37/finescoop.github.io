<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump said last week that it was a 'beautiful thing' when MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi was struck by a rubber bullet during a protest in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd. </p>

<p>Floyd died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer on May 25. In the days following his death, protests erupted across the US and eventually the world.  </p>

<p>On May 30, Velshi was covering a peaceful protest when he was injured by police. </p>

<p>During Trump's Friday night rally, he brought up Velshi's injury while speaking to a crowd in Minnesota.</p>

<p>'I remember this guy Velshi. He got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas and he went down. He was down. "My knee, my knee,' Trump mistakenly recalled. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump (left) aid last week that it was a 'beautiful thing' when MSNBC journalist Ali Velshi was struck by a rubber bullet during a protest in Minnesota following the death of George Floyd</p>

<p>Velshi was actually struck by a rubber bullet and not a canister as Trump claimed last week. </p>

<p>Trump continued: 'These guys didn't care. They moved him aside and they just walked right through. It was like the most beautiful thing.' </p>

<p>'It's called law and order,' Trump said to the cheering crowd. </p>

<p>The next day, Velshi tweeted about Trump's remarks and questioned the president about what his injury had to do with law and order. </p>

<p>'So, <?php echo e('@'); ?>realDonaldTrump, you call my getting hit by authorities in Minneapolis on 5/30/20 (by a rubber bullet, btw, not a tear gas cannister) a “beautiful thing” called “law and order”. What law did I break while covering an entirely peaceful (yes, entirely peaceful) march?'</p>

<p>In a statement, MSNBC slammed Trump for his comments about Velshi.  </p>

<p>The next day, Velshi tweeted about Trump's remarks and questioned the president about what his injury had to do with law and order</p>

<p>Velshi was covering a protest in Minneapolis (pictured on May 29) when he was struck by the rubber bullet </p>

<p>'Freedom of the press is a pillar of our democracy,' the statement reads. </p>

<p>'When the president mocks a journalist for the injury he sustained while putting himself in harm’s way to inform the public, he endangers thousands of other journalists and undermines our freedoms,' the statement continued.</p>

<p>During the rally, Trump then took aim at Rep Ilhan Omar, who is Muslim American. </p>

<p>He asked the crowd if they were 'having a good time with your refugees'. </p>

<p>'How the hell did she win?' Trump asked. </p>

<p>He then claimed that Minneapolis would've been destroyed had he not called in the National Guard. </p>

<p>'You wouldn’t have Minneapolis,' Trump said.</p>
