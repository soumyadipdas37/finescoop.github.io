<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Second seed Dominic Thiem edged a first-set tiebreak before turning up the heat to romp into the U.S. Open quarter-finals with a resounding 7-6(4) 6-1 6-1 victory over Canadian youngster Felix Augur-Aliassime at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Monday.</p>

<p>Top seed Novak Djokovic's disqualification on Sunday for striking a line judge with a ball has left Thiem as one of the favourites and the Austrian gave a composed performance to reach the last eight in New York for the second time in his career.</p>

<p>He was helped in his quest for a maiden Grand Slam title by a below-par performance from Augur-Aliassime, who beat Andy Murray in round two but was well off the pace against Thiem, making 51 unforced errors compared to the second seed's 24.</p>

<p>New US Open favourite Dominic Thiem reached the last-eight of the tournament on Monday</p>

<p>Thiem won 74% of his first serve points and was near flawless at the net, while also sending down 22 winners as he wrapped up the contest in a shade over two hours.</p>

<p>The Austrian second seed will now face young Australian prodigy Alex de Minaur in the last eight. The 21-year-old beat Vasek Pospisil in straight sets earlier on Monday. </p>

<p>Thiem is yet to win a Grand Slam in his career, but did reach this year's Australian Open final - where he lost to Djokovic - while he has also made final appearances at the last two French Open tournaments.  </p>

<p>Thiem won in straight sets against Felix Augur-Aliassime, who beat Andy Murray in round three</p>
