<p>Lemar could leave Atletico in this transfer window and according to AS, he is interested in moving to the Premier League, with Everton and Wolves amongst the clubs that are tracking him.</p>

<p>The France international joined Atletico from Monaco in 2018 for £62million. </p>

<p>Atletico Madrid winger Thomas Lemar has reportedly rejected the opportunity to join Porto</p>

<p>He has previously been linked with clubs such as Arsenal and Manchester United, but neither are said to be interested in him now.</p>

<p>Lemar has made 72 appearances for Atletico but has fallen down the pecking order at the Spanish club.</p>

<p>Lemar could instead make the switch to the Premier League and join Carlo Ancelotti's Everton</p>

<p>Wolves, who have made great progress under Nuno Espirito Santo, is a possible destination</p>

<p>Everton are closing in on the signings of Abdoulaye Doucoure, James Rodriguez and Allan, and Lemar is another player who could make the switch to Goodison Park to join Carlo Ancelotti's side. </p>

<p>Alternatively, the 24-year-old could make the move to Nuno Espirito Santo's Wolves, where he could add further creativity to the side.</p>

<p>Part of France's World Cup-winning squad in 2018, Lemar has just under three years remaining on his current contract with Atletico. </p>
