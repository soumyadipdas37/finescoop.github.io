<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Christian school assistant who was sacked for posting on Facebook about plans to teach LGBT relationships in primary schools is taking her case to an employment tribunal. </p>

<p>Kristie Higgs, 44, was dismissed for gross misconduct by Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, last year. </p>

<p>Mrs Higgs claims senior staff compared her views to those of 'Nazi rightwing extremists' after they saw a screenshot of a private Facebook post, The Times reported. </p>

<p>The case begins at the Bristol employment tribunal today, where Mrs Higgs is seeking £56,000.  </p>

<p>Kristie Higgs, 44, was dismissed for gross misconduct by Farmor's School in Fairford, Gloucestershire, last year </p>

<p>The mother-of-two shared and commented on Facebook posts which raised concerns about relationship education at her son's Church of England primary school. </p>

<p>Mrs Higgs, who was posting on Facebook, under her maiden name, shared two posts in October 2018. </p>

<p>In one, she urged people to sign an online petition against making relationships education mandatory. </p>

<p>In the other, she shared an article from JudyBeth, an American conservative Christian commentator, about the rise of 'transgender ideology' in children's books in American schools. </p>

<p>Mrs Higgs said senior staff at Farmor's School compared her views to those of 'Nazi rightwing extremists' after they saw a screenshot of a private Facebook post</p>

<p>Next to the article, she wrote: 'This is happening in our Primary Schools now!'  </p>

<p>The Christian Legal Centre is supporting Mrs Higgs's case at the employment tribunal, which begins today. </p>

<p>She is seeking £56,000, although the figure could go down because she has since found work. </p>

<p>Lawyers representing Mrs Higgs, who worked at the school as a pastoral worker and administrator for seven years, will argue that her sacking breached her freedom of speech and freedom of religion.</p>

<p>Ahead of the hearing, Mrs Higgs said: 'Nothing could have prepared me for what happened. </p>

<p>In one of the two Facebook posts, she shared an article from JudyBeth, an American conservative Christian commentator</p>

<p>'I was told that the reasons behind my sacking were nothing to do with my Christian beliefs - it had everything to do with my Christian beliefs. </p>

<p>'The whole experience broke my heart. I have been punished for sharing concerns about relationships and sex education. </p>

<p>'My number one concern has always been the effect that learning about sex and gender in school will have on children at such a young age. I have not discriminated against anyone. </p>

<p>'Through my case I want there to be renewed freedom for others, especially Christians, to express their beliefs and opinions without fear of losing their jobs.'</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Farmor's School said: 'As this matter is subject to ongoing tribunal proceedings it would be inappropriate to comment at this stage.'</p>
