<p>Then things take a turn for the worse, as the music stops, Justin and his co-workers gather around to be informed the plant is shutting down due to a 'global situation.' </p>

<p>As the song resume, the lyrics continue to seem to be personal to the Never Say Never hitmaker 'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.' </p>
