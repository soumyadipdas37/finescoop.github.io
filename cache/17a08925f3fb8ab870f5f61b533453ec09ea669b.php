<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Black Lives Matter protesters smashed the windows of a public library in downtown Louisville and threw a flare inside as authorities extend a citywide curfew into the weekend and the National Guard gets ready to deploy.  </p>

<p>About 100 demonstrators have gathered in Louisville, defying a nighttime curfew and nearby police in riot gear, marking a second night of protests after Wednesday's decision not to pursue criminal charges against officers in the Breonna Taylor case.</p>

<p>The curfew took hold at 9pm in the Kentucky city as the protesters met up at the First Unitarian Church. </p>

<p>Police in riot gear could be seen blocking nearby streets. </p>

<p>One of those arrested on Thursday night was Attica Scott, a Kentucky state lawmaker and author of 'Breonna's law.'</p>

<p>The proposed legislation would ban the use of 'no-knock' warrants statewide.</p>

<p>Louisville police used a 'no-knock' warrant to enter Taylor's home in the early morning hours of March 13. After Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at the officers thinking he was being robbed, police shot back and killed Taylor. </p>

<p>People in the crowd chanted 'Black Lives Matter' as tensions continued for a second night in the city.</p>

<p>Louisville police released images showing officers detain protesters who violated curfew</p>

<p>Before the march began, protester Shameka Parrish-Wright told the crowd to stay together and take care of each other if they were met with force.</p>

<p>'We want to show the country and the world what we’re about,' Parrish-Wright said. </p>

<p>Some protesters blocked roads as they marched. Police, meanwhile, were seen nearby and patrol cars blocked some roads. </p>

<p>There was no immediate signs of a confrontation.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear mobilized 500 members of the National Guard.</p>

<p>The governor ordered them deployed to Louisville to prevent civil unrest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, city officials who initially announced a 72-hour curfew have extended it through the weekend.</p>

<p>Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said the curfew, which goes into effect from 9pm to 6:30am each night, does not apply to people commuting to work, going to houses of worship for services or seeking medical attention, the Louisville Courier Journal reported.  </p>

<p>Fischer has encouraged Louisville residents to begin heading home at 8pm each night so as to allow enough time to abide by the curfew. </p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday evening, BLM marchers confronted about a dozen members of an armed militia.</p>

<p>The militia members were dressed in full military garb and carrying assault rifles. They identified themselves as 'Oath Keepers,' a group that calls itself 'nonpartisan association of current and former serving military, police, and first responders' whose goal is to 'defend the Constitution.'</p>

<p>The Oath Keepers members said they were in Louisville to protect property. </p>

<p>'We're not here to start nothing,' a militia member from North Carolina told the Courier Journal. </p>

<p>The Southern Poverty Law Center calls Oath Keepers 'one of the largest radical anti-government groups in the U.S.' </p>

<p>A few BLM protesters confronted members of the Oath Keepers, but most kept away.</p>

<p>'Back up! Don't be stupid!' one man yelled. </p>

<p>'Walk through and keep moving. Do not engage these people with no guns!'</p>

<p>Shortly afterward, Breonna Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, made a brief appearance at Jefferson Square Park.</p>

<p>She stood for a few moments at the memorial that was erected for her daughter.</p>

<p>Palmer, who has not said anything publicly since the grand jury decision was announced on Wednesday, wore a black satin jacket that read 'Until Freedom.'</p>

<p>Underneath the jacket she wore a white t-shirt with a picture of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron over the words 'Mitch's b****.'</p>

<p>Cameron, a Republican and the first African-American elected to the position of state attorney general, is a protege of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. </p>
