<p>But without a doubt, the centerpiece of the images was the media personality's coif, which featured large blonde curls housed in a fishnet hair net.</p>

<p>The outspoken starlet sold the images with her trademark attitude, serving sex kitten expressions with a blood red lip and heavy eye shadow. </p>

<p>'Who owns my heart?! ❤️' Miley asked in the caption, along with a skull emoji. </p>

<p>She tagged both the <?php echo e('@'); ?>iheartfestival as well as her current photographer collaborator Vijat M, who's worked with the likes of Kylie Jenner, Lil Nas X and Paris Hilton in the past. </p>

<p>The one and only: As of late, the 27-year-old singer's social media activity has been centered around her performance over the weekend</p>

<p>Some of the images from the shoot made it into the backdrop of her iHeartRadio gig, which saw the former Hannah Montana star perform, among other things, a raw and full throttle rendition of the Blondie classic Heart Of Glass.</p>

<p>For her onstage look, the We Can't Stop crooner modeled another edgy sheer look, this time in a sexy black body stocking with artfully placed paneling. </p>

<p>Miley has definitely been feeling her Seventies and Eighties rock goddesses of late, sporting a Par Benetar-inspired grown-out pixie haircut and posting vintage images of Blondie's Debbie Harry to her Instagram feed.</p>

<p>Miley's recent look was just the latest of a series in which she's pushed the envelope.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, the TV and music star danced topless in a black and white video clip on her Instagram feed, writing that 'being single means having more alone time to video myself stripping naked to Joan Jett'.</p>

<p>The gifted artist recently broke things off with her beau Cody Simpson, a fellow singer, whom she'd been seeing for 10 months.</p>

<p>It was just the latest breakup in a yearlong period that saw Miley end her decade-long on-off relationship with Liam Hemsworth last August with a divorce, followed by a brief rebound relationship with reality star Kaitlynn Carter.</p>
