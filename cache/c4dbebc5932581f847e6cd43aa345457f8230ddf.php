<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mesut Ozil has insisted he 'is fit and ready' to go for Arsenal ahead of the new Premier League season but admits how regularly he features is 'out of his hands'. </p>

<p>The 31-year-old did not play for the Gunners after the Premier League restart in June after a combination of a back injury and being frozen out by boss Mikel Arteta saw him miss the remaining 13 games.</p>

<p>The German - whose last competitive game came in Arsenal's 1-0 win against West Ham in March - has entered the final year of his contract at Emirates Stadium, with the north London side keen to shift his £350,000-a-week salary off the wage bill.</p>

<p>Arsenal star Mesut Ozil has revealed he is fit and ready to go ahead of the new season</p>

<p>Ozil did not feature for Arsenal after the restart after being frozen out by boss Mikel Arteta</p>

<p>However, Ozil has reportedly insisted he will see out the remainder of his deal and on a Q&amp;A on his personal Twitter account confirmed he is ready to feature for the Gunners in their opening game at Fulham on Saturday if called upon.</p>

<p>'I'm fit &amp; ready and doing my best,' Ozil wrote when asked a question if he was fit and ready for selection for the Premier League opener at Craven Cottage.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately it's not in my hands to decide about the squad on the weekend. We will see!'</p>

<p>But in a Q&amp;A on his Twitter page Ozil revealed he is ready to feature for Arsenal this season</p>

<p>The Germany World Cup winner also poked fun at rivals Tottenham for their trophy drought</p>

<p>The 2014 World Cup winner has lifted three FA Cups and a Community Shield in his seven-year Arsenal career to date.</p>

<p>He did not receive a medal last season for the club's 14th FA Cup triumph last season however, having only featured in the third-round tie against Leeds in the competition.</p>

<p>But he could not resist taking a cheeky swipe at rivals Tottenham's 12-year trophy drought, who are still waiting to lift their first title since the 2008 League Cup. </p>

<p>The German also revealed he does not listen to critics and focuses only on himself</p>

<p>When asked if he would rather play for Spurs or retire, he replied: 'If I don’t want to win a cup, I should go there.'</p>

<p>Ozil has been the subject of plenty of criticism linked to his work-rate and performances in season-defining games since his arrival in England seven years ago.</p>

<p>But he insisted he does not lose much sleep over what is written about him and added: 'Don't listen to the critics. Just focus on yourself'.</p>
