<p>The 22-year-old Penrith Panthers star, who was criticised for breaking lockdown rules to throw a TikTok party with young women earlier this year, said his battle was so intense he was forced to undergo a mental overhaul. </p>

<p>NRL star Nathan Cleary (pictured) has opened up about his struggles with criticism</p>

<p>The halfback said years of struggling with judgement from fans and the media had affected his performance on the field.  </p>

<p>'That fear, it affects you as a person, affects your ability to play. It paralyses you,' he explained. </p>

<p>Cleary's anxiety first kicked in when the Penrith number 7 was selected to represent New South Wales at the State of Origin in 2018.  </p>

<p>The 22-year-old said he hadn't encountered much criticism early in his career and had a hard time dealing with disappointment from fans over his performance.    </p>

<p>Fans continued to slam the halfback's playing in 2019 and Cleary said reading the comments on social media 'wasn't healthy'. </p>

<p>Cleary tried to ignore the criticism but it caused him to have major anxiety before playing a game.   </p>

<p>'There were even times in games where it would be in my mind too, I'd make a mistake and start worrying about what people would be thinking,' he explained. </p>

<p>Cleary (pictured during a Penrith Panthers game) said the anxiety over criticism from fans began when he represented New South Wales in the State of Origin in 2018 </p>

<p>The 22-year-old (pictured) said his fears were so extreme they affected his performance on the field. Cleary later began practicing mindfulness to overcome his anxiety </p>

<p>The halfback said his biggest fear was disappointing everyday fans, rather than teammates or analysts, because he wanted to 'please people'. </p>

<p>Cleary eventually approached the head of performance for the Panthers, Hayden Knowles, and sought help in making changes to his mindset.   </p>

<p>Knowles devoted the last summer to reforming the 22-year-old, adding 5kg to his frame, raising his power clean to 130kg and improving his mindset. </p>

<p>Cleary studied books and papers on mindfulness and even enrolled in an online course directed by former Super Bowl Winner and NFL coach Pete Carroll.     </p>

<p>Cleary was slammed over a TikTok scandal in April that saw him mingling with a group of women on Anzac Day (pictured above) while New South Wales was in Stage Three lockdown </p>

<p>The halfback said it taught him to live with purpose and only listen to the people who matter to him.   </p>

<p>Cleary said it helped him overcome a the lockdown scandal in April which saw him fined and suspended from playing for two games. </p>

<p>The player was slammed for ignoring social distancing rules on Anzac Day and was recorded mingling with at least five women during strict Stage Three lockdown. </p>

<p>The 22-year-old said he was disappointed in himself but had developed the skills to move on.   </p>
