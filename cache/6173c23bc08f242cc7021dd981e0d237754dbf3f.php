<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sir David Attenborough has revealed that he found the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children 'charming' after meeting them last week.</p>

<p>The 94-year-old naturalist was photographed with Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five, and Prince Louis, two, along with their mother Kate, 38, after enjoying a private viewing of his newest documentary A Life On Our Planet with Prince William, 38.</p>

<p>After meeting in the grounds of Kensington Palace, Sir David told The Times that it was a 'very nice domestic occasion'.</p>

<p>The broadcaster even gifted Prince George a fossilised giant shark's tooth after discovering the young royal was a 'massive fan'. </p>

<p>Sir David Attenborough has revealed that he found the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's children 'charming' after meeting them last week (pictured)</p>

<p>'When I was his age, I remember being given fossils by a grown-up, so I thought I would do the same,” Sir David said.</p>

<p>'[George asked] What it was? How big it was? And so on. He was certainly very interested. He seemed to like it. He is very interested in fossils. She [Charlotte] was too. All three seemed charming.'</p>

<p>The children are thought to have bombarded Prince William and Kate to meet Sir David - with the Duchess previously admitting that they're 'massive fans' of the conservationist.</p>

<p>Prince George was photographed looking intrigued as he handled the fossilised tooth from an extinct Carcharocles megalodon - one of the most feared predators to have swum in the seas.  </p>

<p>The broadcaster even gifted Prince George a fossilised giant shark's tooth after discovering the young royal was a 'massive fan'. Pictured, the royal holding it while sitting next to Prince William and Prince Louis</p>

<p>The giant shark tooth was found by Sir David during a family holiday to Malta in the late 1960s. </p>

<p>Jaws may have terrified you at the cinema, but the iconic great white would have been dwarfed by Carcharocles megalodon, the largest shark in the history of the planet.</p>

<p>The giant creatures lived between 23million and 2.6million years ago and scientists are divided over how and why the species perished.</p>

<p>The predator grew up to an incredible 59 feet (18 metres) long, and it used its giant teeth, that could grow up to 7.1 inches (18cm) to feed on smaller marine mammals.</p>

<p>In the past, climate changes have generally been blamed for its disappearance, while some research also suggested the giant shark became extinct because the diversity of its prey decreased and new predators appeared as competitors. </p>

<p>It was embedded in the island's soft yellow limestone, which was laid down during the Miocene period some 23million years ago.</p>

<p>William and the veteran broadcaster watched A Life On Our Planet, a revealing and powerful first-hand account in which Sir David reflects on both the defining moments of his life as a naturalist and the devastating changes he has witnessed.</p>

<p>Socially distanced in the open air, the Duke of Cambridge and Sir David were offered directors' chairs with their names printed on the back - but in a change of plan they sat in each other's seats.</p>

<p>The 94-year-old broadcaster chatted to William, Kate and their three children George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis after the screening on Thursday.</p>

<p>William interviewed Sir David at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last year, and during the discussion the broadcaster warned that humanity needed to act so that they did not 'annihilate part of the natural world'.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also previously met the conservationist in September 2019 at Birkenhead, for the naming ceremony of the polar research ship the RRS Sir David Attenborough.</p>

<p>The encounter appears in the upcoming ITV documentary, Prince William: A Planet For Us All.</p>

<p>In a new clip to promote the royal's programme - which shows his passion for the planet and search for ways to restore the environment for the next generation - Prince William is seen greeting the broadcaster by saying: 'Here’s a recognised face,' while Kate admits that George, Charlotte and Louis are disappointed to not be in attendance. </p>

<p>The duchess, who revealed in lockdown that her eldest son was often watching David Attenborough's Blue Planet, says: 'The children were very upset that we were coming to see you and they weren’t coming. They’re massive fans of yours.'</p>

<p>With a shared passion for protecting the natural world, William and Sir David continue to support each other in their mission to tackle some of the biggest environmental challenges the planet faces.</p>

<p>This includes working together on William's Earthshot Prize, an ambitious global environment project announced last December to combat climate issues. Further details about the prize are expected in the coming weeks. </p>
