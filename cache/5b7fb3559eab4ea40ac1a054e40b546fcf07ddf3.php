<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There may have been a delay to getting stuck in. But six months down the track Network Rail has provided a huge boost to the Great British September Clean – by once again pledging to get all 41,000 employees involved.</p>

<p>The firm, which owns and manages most of the country’s railway network, says litter, fly-tipping and graffiti can cause safety problems and delays for passengers.</p>

<p>Earlier this year when the Spring Clean campaign was getting into gear, the company promised to offer all staff volunteer days to join litter-picks in their communities.</p>

<p>It had to be postponed due to the coronavirus – but Network Rail is back on board and getting stuck in during the campaign’s final week.</p>

<p>The clean-up, organised by Keep Britain Tidy and backed by the Daily Mail, has already had great success after kicking off on September 11.</p>

<p>The likes of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Wombles of Wimbledon and children up and down the country have all got involved.</p>

<p>Network Rail said it is 'determined' to renew its efforts in the fight against litter.</p>

<p>This week staff sprang into action and took part in a litter pick around its headquarters in Milton Keynes.</p>

<p>Chief executive Andrew Haines said: ‘Litter and fly-tipping looks awful and it causes delays for passengers.</p>

<p>Wilko have also thrown their weight behind the Great British September Clean with staff taking part in a clean-up outside their base in Worksop, East Midlands</p>

<p>‘We pledged extra cash for bigger clean ups back in March and we’ve seen some great results, but there is more to do and we are determined to renew our efforts and keep the pressure on. </p>

<p>‘Clearing up the railway is specialist work but we can all raise awareness of just how dangerous and disruptive littering can be, and I am also encouraging every one of our staff to do their bit.’</p>

<p>Earlier this year the company pledged up to £2million for clean-ups and prevention as part of the Spring Clean campaign.</p>

<p>Litter is a huge problem on the railways as it can attract rats that chew on cables, leading to signal failures, delays and accidents. Discarded metal cans and foil have also been known to cause short circuits.</p>

<p>Walkers brand manager Nick Day got his partner Sarah and their dogs, Springer spaniel Rolo and Labradour Tess, (above) to take part in a litter pick near his home in Tring, Hertfordshire</p>

<p>Network Rail also spends £3.5million a year removing graffiti in a bid to try and make the railways look nicer and discourage the dangerous vandalism.</p>

<p>The company has been forced to install fences and CCTV to combat fly-tipping as well as maintain security in hotspots.</p>

<p>And yesterday Network Rail introduced 32 coffee cup recycling bins at seven of Britain’s busiest stations including King’s Cross, Waterloo and Leeds.</p>

<p>Jo Lewington, chief environment and sustainability officer at Network Rail, said: ‘We know more of our passengers want to do their bit for the environment and recycling is an easy way for them to get involved.’</p>
