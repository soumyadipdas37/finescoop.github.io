<p>Her throwback came as her Time100 Talks was published with TIME reporter Raisa Bruner and Kiva CEO Neville Crawley.</p>

<p>Sofia launched a partnership with Kiva in the spring; Kiva is a global micro-finance nonprofit to support their COVID-19 response fund.</p>

<p>When asked why it's important to her: 'I've always supported and believed in micro-finance I've seen the impact that providing small business loans to marginalized communities can help, especially women owned businesses.' </p>

<p>The Modern Family actress also said it is important to empower the women 'to create their own income.' </p>

<p>Gorgeous: Sofia's two-piece crossed on her chest to emphasis her assets </p>

<p>Sofia added that the nonprofit focuses on the people who are in trouble due to the economic impact of COVID-19.</p>

<p>On why entrepreneurship is important: 'Personally I feel like it liberates you when you're able to control you're income and usually women are the ones that - they don't spend their money on partying and alcohol. </p>

<p>'They spend it on their family. Helping their kids, helping the family - so I think it's super important to help them because I think it spreads more.'</p>

<p>Adding: 'I feel like women have a lot to give and personally I love that Kiva does that.'</p>

<p>Close to her heart: The throwback came as her Time100 Talks was published with TIME reporter Raisa Bruner and Kiva CEO Neville Crawley</p>
