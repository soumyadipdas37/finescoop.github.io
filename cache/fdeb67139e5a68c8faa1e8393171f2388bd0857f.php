<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A curious bear gave a Massachusetts man a surprise wake up call from his poolside nap. </p>

<p>Matthew Bete, of Greenfield, Massachusetts, was sleeping in a lounge chair by his pool Saturday, when a bear wandered in through an open gate. </p>

<p>The stealthy bear made a beeline for the swimming pool, taking a leisurely drink of water, while Bete slept peacefully. </p>

<p>Once hydrated, the bear turned around and spotted Bete. </p>

<p>Matthew Bete was caught on video sleeping in a lounge chair by his pool when a bear wandered in through an open gate and drank from his pool </p>

<p>The bear then startled Bete awake by touching his foot (left). Bete's movements scared off the bear, which Bete then tries to take a picture of (right) </p>

<p>The bear then padded over to Bete, cautiously sniffing the sleeping man's foot, before reaching out a paw and gently patting it. </p>

<p>The motion woke up Bete with a start and his sudden movement scared the bear off.</p>

<p>The whole incident - including his scramble to take a picture of the fleeing bear - was caught on Bete's home security camera. </p>

<p>Bete's wife, Dawn Bete, posted the video on Facebook, writing: 'Matt was a little startled yesterday while taking a rest by the pool.' </p>

<p>She told MassLive that she wasn't home at the time of the incident, but that Bete had 'texted me a picture of the bear running through the front yard and said the bear nudged his foot while he was sleeping by pool.</p>

<p>'Of course, I thought he was kidding! He told me to look at the Ring video,' she said.</p>

<p>Dawn Bete told WBZ that 'Matt just stayed calm and knew he had a chair and stool there to protect him if he needed it,' calling the incident 'Just crazy!'</p>

<p>Massachusetts state says that black bears have been expanding their territory throughout the state in recent years. </p>

<p>The state's website encourages people who encounter bears where they don't belong to 'yell' and 'make lots of noise' because a 'bear's first response to something unusual is to leave.'   </p>
