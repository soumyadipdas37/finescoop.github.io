<p>Raniere, the former leader of NXIVM who is due to be sentenced next month, was convicted last year on charges he turned some of his followers into sex slaves. </p>

<p>In an interview with CBS News that aired on Tuesday, five members - two women and three men - spoke out in Raniere's defense. </p>

<p>They denied that NXIVM was a cult despite some former members publicly claiming it was. </p>

<p>Raniere is awaiting sentencing on charges including sex trafficking of children, conspiracy and conspiracy to commit forced labor. </p>

<p>He started NXIVM in the 1990s in upstate New York as a self-improvement group that expanded across the country. </p>

<p>Prosecutors allege that Raniere started a secret branch, known as the DOS, in about 2015 that was just for women. </p>

<p>Prosecutors say the secret society was comprised of brainwashed female 'slaves' who were branded with his initials and forced to have sex with him. </p>

<p>His adherents included Smallville actress Allison Mack and Seagram's liquor fortune heiress Clare Bronfman. </p>

<p>Both women have pleaded guilty to assisting the conspiracy and are awaiting sentencing. </p>

<p>The two women who spoke out in Raniere's defense on Tuesday are former Battlestar Galactica actress Nicki Clyne, who is also married to Mack, and Michele Hatchette.</p>

<p>Both said they were members of DOS - the alleged sex cult branch. </p>

<p>They refused to say whether they were branded with Raniere's initials or whether they had had sex with the former leader. </p>

<p>A former member of the group had claimed Clyne acted as a recruiter for Raniere but she was never charged with any crimes. </p>

<p>'We're not denying that certain things took place. There is evidence that certain things happened. How they happened, why they happened and why certain people chose them is a whole another conversation,' Clyne said. </p>

<p>'It's very unfortunate the way the word NXIVM has been applied and is now synonymous with the term sex cult. I don't even know how to define what that is.'</p>

<p>Speaking of the branding, Hatchette said: 'I think there's a different between being branded and getting a brand. Scarification is an art...'</p>

<p>When asked whether she had sex with Raniere, Hatchette said: 'We want to talk about DOS... I just want to step back a little. If I went up to you and asked how many people you had sex with, it's none of my business.</p>

<p>'And we've been in a position where our personal lives have been made public without our permission.' </p>

<p>Seagram's liquor fortune heiress Clare Bronfman, who is also one of Raniere's adherents, is due to be sentenced on Wednesday </p>

<p>The five members said the continue to stand by NXIVM and Raniere.</p>

<p>They believe Raniere was convicted based on a trial by media and have suggested there was prosecutorial misconduct involved in his case. </p>

<p>'When people say, 'Well, why would you believe in someone if they were convicted?' Well, it's because that system might not be working anymore,' Eduardo Asunsolo said. </p>

<p>Asunsolo said he believes the former leader is innocent. </p>

<p>'Even if you do believe someone is guilty, then you can still stand by them because you love them, because you're a friend of theirs,' he said.  </p>

<p>In a submission to the court earlier this month, Raniere's lawyers said he had no remorse and stands by his innocence. </p>

<p>He has accused the government of misconduct and says he deserves a new trial.   </p>

<p>Bronfman is scheduled to be sentenced on Wednesday. Prosecutors are demanding she serve five years in prison.</p>

<p>Mack is still awaiting sentencing and Raniere's sentencing is scheduled for October 27.  </p>
