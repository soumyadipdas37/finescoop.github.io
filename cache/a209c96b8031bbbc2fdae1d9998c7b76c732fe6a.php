<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Heidi Klum is said to have had a scare last weekend when a stranger allegedly visited her home.</p>

<p>According to TMZ, the model's Los Angeles house was visited by a man who pounded on her front door claiming Jesus had told him to. </p>

<p>The LAPD were quickly called to the scene and although he had left the house by this point, they found him on a nearby road. </p>

<p>Police are said to have placed the man on a 5150 psychiatric hold after suspecting he suffered with mental health issues.  </p>

<p>Heidi, 47, was home during the incident but didn't answer the door herself so didn't have any contact with the man.  </p>

<p>It's believed that Heidi's house was not specifically targeted, with sources telling the site that the police who spoke with the man considered him to be 'confused'. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Heidi's representatives and a LAPD spokesperson for comment. </p>

<p>Home sweet home: The retired Victoria's Secret Angel certainly has lots of room to roam around her 11K-square-foot property, which features six bedrooms and nine bathrooms</p>

<p>Heidi lives at her $9.875 million Bel-Air mansion in the exclusive gated community of Stone Ridge with her husband Tom Kaulitz and children - it is not known if any of them were home during the incident.  </p>

<p>The former Victoria's Secret model has two sons, Henry, 14, and Johan, 13, as well as a daughter Lou, 10, with ex-husband, singer Seal, 56.</p>

<p>She also has a daughter, Leni, 16, with ex-partner Flavio Briatore. She dated art dealer Vito Schnabel, 33, then moved on to Tom.</p>

<p>Heidi recently filed a request for an emergency court hearing seeking to force her ex-husband Seal to allow her to take their children to Germany with her in October.</p>

<p>While he expressed concerns about the kids traveling to Europe during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Seal has now agreed to allow Heidi to take them with her.</p>
