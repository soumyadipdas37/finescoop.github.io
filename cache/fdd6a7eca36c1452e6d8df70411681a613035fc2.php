<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel Andrews' days as Victorian premier could be numbered, with a motion of no  confidence likely to be tabled against him in a matter of days.   </p>

<p>State Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien is set to make the proposal on Thursday, arguing the Andrews government had lost the support of Victorians over its handling of COVID-19.</p>

<p>He said failures in the hotel quarantine system and contract tracing measures led to the state's horror second wave and the subsequent return to lockdown.</p>

<p>Lower house MPs will vote on the motion next month, which would then have eight days to be passed by the assembly if successful. </p>

<p>Victorian Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien (pictured) will introduce a motion of no confidence against the Andrews government in Parliament on Thursday</p>

<p>'Victoria deserves the chance for a fresh start,' Mr O'Brien said, the Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>'Every Labor MP will have to decide whether they will vote to protect the jobs of their communities or the job of the premier.</p>

<p>'A no-confidence motion is not a decision made lightly, but increasingly frustrated Victorians are telling us loud and clear that Andrews must go.'  </p>

<p>A motion of no confidence is a statement or vote as to whether or not the ruling party is still fit to hold office, with the opposition only permitted to present one per parliamentary term.  </p>

<p>However, the motion is unlikely to pass as the House of Representatives has an 11-seat Labor majority.    </p>

<p>News of the attempt to oust Victoria's Premier comes as he faces heat over a contradicting account provided at an inquiry into the state's second wave of COVID-19 </p>

<p>The Andrews government has been plagued by criticism over a series of controversies that have been attributed to the second outbreak in Victoria. </p>

<p>The contagion was traced back to the breaches in hotel quarantine, with claims security guards from private contracting firms failed to enforce COVID-19 safety rules - with some allegedly having sex with returned travellers.  </p>

<p>Premier Andrews was slammed for outsourcing guards rather than using the ADF, with him later telling an inquiry into the fiasco that he was never given the offer.     </p>

<p>On Tuesday, emails presented to the inquiry contradicted his statements, revealing the Prime Minister's office had written three letters offering the defence force but none were accepted. </p>

<p>The next state election will take place in 2022. </p>
