<p>TIMELESS DESIGN</p>

<p>Pre-Covid, high priestess of fashion Anna Wintour decreed leather trench coats and embroidery to be key looks for 2020.</p>

<p>Personally, I’ll ditch the leather coat. Glamorous as it may be, my husband’s reaction to it would be more than just an eye roll.</p>

<p>Embroidery, however, is a trend I have loved ever since British designer Bruce Oldfield gifted me a hand-stitched veil for my wedding more than a decade ago. It’s timeless.</p>

<p>I’ve since loaned the veil to my sister and a close friend. One day, maybe my daughters will want to use it too.</p>

<p>MASTERFULLY CRAFTED</p>

<p>The work that goes into embroidery is intricate and skilled, which is why New York-based Ulla Johnson and Etro showed off pieces like this on the catwalk.</p>

<p>While High-Street versions are made by machine to cut costs, the pretty result can be just as treasured.</p>

<p>PERFECT PICK-ME-UP</p>

<p>The end of summer is calling, so invest in styles that will transition into autumn with ease.</p>

<p>I’ve teamed this easy-to-wear top by Anthropologie with smart trousers — perfect for going back to the office.</p>

<p>Or wear it with jeans if you’re still on Zoom calls.</p>

<p>KEEP STYLING SIMPLE</p>

<p>Go for an all-over embroidered piece if you want to make a statement, like the jacket from Monsoon, or there’s plenty out there with just a hint of stitching — the top from River Island has a more subtle approach.</p>

<p>Embroidery follows the same fashion rule as wearing a print: the rest of your look is best kept simple.</p>

<p>The skirt from Boden will look great with a white shirt or a rollneck and tights when it gets colder, but the colourful threads mean you will add cheer to your style in the depths of winter.   </p>
