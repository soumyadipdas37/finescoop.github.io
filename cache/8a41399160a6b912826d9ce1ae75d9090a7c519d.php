<p>Well done: The Prime Minister, 56, has lost at least a stone in weight and has enlisted the help of a trainer after recovering from coronavirus (left in October, right on a run last week)</p>

<p>Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body. </p>

<p>'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.</p>

<p>'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand. So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?' </p>

<p>Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.</p>
