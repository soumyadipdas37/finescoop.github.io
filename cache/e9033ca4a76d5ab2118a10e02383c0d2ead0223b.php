<p>Gina shot to fame two years ago after entering a Maxim modelling competition to raise money for an ill friend's medical expenses. </p>

<p>Her age-defying photos soon went viral, leading to the blonde bombshell being dubbed 'the world's hottest grandma'.</p>

<p>She quickly amassed a huge following on Instagram, but later turned to stripping off on the subscription-based website OnlyFans after Instagram kept removing her photos from their platform for being too revealing.</p>

<p>In a year and-a-half, Gina claims to have earned around $500,000 on the platform.</p>

<p>'I decided to start an OnlyFans account this year so I could connect with my supporters without Instagram's unfair censorship,' she told the Daily Mail in December. </p>

<p>'Instagram has become way too PC and keeps hiding all of my photos even though I'm covered up. It was completely unfair because they let other models get away with much worse.' </p>

<p>Superstar: Gina has earned around $500,000 in the 18 months that she's been selling racy photos and videos of herself on OnlyFans</p>

<p>Thanks to OnlyFans, the Gold Coast grandmother is now earning thousands of dollars a month and was able to move out of her Sunshine Coast apartment and into a lavish four-bedroom waterfront home with a pool and Jacuzzi.</p>

<p>'OnlyFans is way better than Instagram because I can post whatever I want and interact with my fans on a much more intimate level,' she said.</p>

<p>'Now I live a great lifestyle thanks to my beautiful fans who support me. I've been able to afford a $1.3 million home for myself and my daughter, I drive a Mercedes and I own two jet skis.'</p>

<p>'I've been able to afford a $1.3 million home for myself and my daughter, I drive a Mercedes and I own two jet skis,' Gina told Daily Mail Australia last year. (Pictured with daughter Summer)</p>

<p>She continued: 'But the best part is that I can work from home and be a full time mother to my daughter Summer. She's only six so being there for her is the most important thing to me.'</p>

<p>The blonde bombshell is now one of the top creators on the platform, but unlike many models, she claims that her content is tasteful and not pornographic.</p>

<p>'I keep my content glamorous and sexy unlike other models who bare what they had for breakfast. It’s all in the tease,' she explained.</p>
