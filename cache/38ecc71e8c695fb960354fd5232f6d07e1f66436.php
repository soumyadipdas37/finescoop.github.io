<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Strange things are happening at this US Open and among them last night was the abrupt collapse of Cam Norrie, who missed an excellent chance to make the last sixteen.</p>

<p>Norrie was making decent headway at a set-all and a break up before losing eleven of the last twelve games to go down 7-6 4-6 6-2 6-1 to the world number 99, Alejandro Davidovich Fokina of Spain.</p>

<p>The intensity drained out of him like water gurgling down a plug hole from when he failed to consolidate his lead, having swung the match in his favour towards the end of the second set.</p>

<p>Cam Norrie crashed out of the US Open third round, losing to Alejandro Davidovich Fokina</p>

<p>The world No 99 stunned the struggling Brit by winning 11 or the final 12 games in New York</p>

<p>Norrie was being followed on court by Dan Evans, resuming his rain-delayed third round against Frenchman and trying to make the third round at Flushing Meadows for the fourth time. After what had been an encouraging start to the week for the British contingent he was the last man standing.</p>

<p>Against a lower ranked opponent this was a serious missed opportunity for Norrie, who would have guaranteed himself a minimum £190,000 for making the second week.</p>

<p>The match was a battle of wills rather than anything attractive to watch, but the strain of two hard-fought victories over Argentinian opponents for the GB number three seemed to spring to the fore. </p>

<p>The British player missed a golden chance to enter the last-16 of the tournament with the loss</p>

<p>By the end of his three matches Norrie had faced 59 break points in total, showing what hard work it had been for a player who lacks a major weapon to gain him free points.</p>

<p>There was really nothing between them until he unravelled, and the blonde Spaniard will have been gratefully surprised.</p>

<p>Given what an opportunity this was for both players it was hardly surprising that there was plenty of tension in the first set. Aside from the prize money there was a bonanza of badly needed ranking points on offer.</p>

<p>The 25 year-old lefthander, ranked 76, clung on grimly at the start, making a surfeit of errors in the opener until he was outplayed to lose the tiebreak 7-2.</p>

<p>In the second set it was the Spaniard, the son of a Malaga-based former Russian boxer, who got tight and he lost focus in allowing Norrie to get ahead.</p>

<p>Norrie and his Spanish opponent were well matched until the Brit unravelled in the third set </p>

<p>He got an early break up in the third, before the momentum abruptly shifted in what was always a dour baseline struggle. From 2-1 up the Putney-based player lost five straight games and received a code violation for an audible obscenity at the end of the third.</p>

<p>At least the losers will be able to get out of town quickly, which is more than can be said for the six players judged to be 'close contacts' of the positively-tested Benoit Paire.</p>

<p>According to one of them, Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens, they have now been told they cannot even leave their hotel rooms despite having been eliminated from the tournament and been promised their own mini bubble of practice facilities.</p>

<p>Benoit Paire tested positive for Covid-19 at the tournament, causing concern for competitors</p>

<p>Frustration is mounting to the point where they offered to club together to take a private jet back to Paris from New York, a request refused by the State Health Authority.</p>

<p>Amid all the debate among players there was support for the US Tennis Association's strict stance from former world number one Andy Roddick, who criticised the complaint of another of the affected players, Kiki Mladenovic, that they were being treated like 'prisoners or criminals'.</p>

<p>'Prisoners/criminals don't get a chance to play sport/2nd rounds for 6 figures in prize money,' he tweeted. 'Safety protocols are the only reason there's the chance for players/fans to enjoy the Open. Unfortunately perspective is seriously lacking with this take.'</p>
