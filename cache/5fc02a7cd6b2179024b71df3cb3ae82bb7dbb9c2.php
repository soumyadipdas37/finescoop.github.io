<p>The auburn-haired beauty has been happily single since splitting with Luke Mabbott. </p>

<p>Back in June, the TV star broke her silence on her split from Luke, 25, four months after they finished in third place on the first-ever winter edition of Love Island. </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Demi confirmed the pair officially called it quits in May, a decision she claims was encouraged by the heating engineer, 25.</p>

<p>She admitted that while 'there's no bad blood' between the former couple, she doesn't believe they'll rekindle their romance in the future.</p>

<p>In January, the auburn beauty entered the Cape Town villa as a bombshell, initially embarking on a romance with Nas Majeed.</p>

<p>But once the hopefuls were put to the test with a trip to Casa Amor, Demi was left heartbroken when she discovered her love interest returned with Eva Zapico.</p>
