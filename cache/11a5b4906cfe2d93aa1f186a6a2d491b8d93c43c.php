<p>Last week Coronation Street bosses were forced to reschedule production after a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 after being on set last week.</p>

<p>The long-running soap had to briefly shut down certain areas of the set for a deep clean, after the coronavirus positive actor had filmed scenes.</p>

<p>It has been reported that although certain areas were closed down it did not affect filming due to the soap's two-metre distancing rules.</p>

<p>Getting fit: Hanni was seen leading the way as she worked out on a pink mat in the middle of their living room</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the ITV soap said: 'We can confirm a member of the Coronation Street team has tested positive for coronavirus. The protocols we have in place for such an eventuality have been implemented and the individual is now self isolating at home. </p>

<p>'Although we do not believe anyone has been within 2m of the individual, as a precaution, the production team who were working with the individual have been notified.</p>

<p>'In keeping with health and safety guidance, we have also undertaken an intensive clean of touch points in the cohort area where the individual was working and areas of the building they visited.' </p>

<p>Affected: It comes after Coronation Street bosses were forced to reschedule production when a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 after being on set last week</p>
