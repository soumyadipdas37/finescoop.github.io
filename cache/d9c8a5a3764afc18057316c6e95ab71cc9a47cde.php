<p>The dining room is akin to a banqueting hall, with dark wood panelling, low lighting and an armoured life-size replica of Ragnar - complete with a sword - behind glass casing at the head of the 14-seat table</p>

<p>After days spent 'experiencing life at the edge of existence', Burgess Yachts suggests that guests can opt for some pampering at the yacht's spa centre (pictured), which includes a gym, massage room, sauna and steam room</p>

<p>Other pieces of equipment on board the eye-catching icebreaker, which has been designed to glide through ice up to 20 inches thick, include jet skis, snowmobiles, paddleboards, surfboards and waterskis. An Airbus EC145 helicopter can be added to the vessel by request for an additional charge. </p>

<p>The photos released by Burgess Yachts, which is handling the charter, show Ragnar in action off the shores of Iceland and in the North Sea.</p>

<p>The helipad is visible on the top deck. Just behind, there is a family-sized jacuzzi and open-air pool area so that guests can soak up the otherwordly landscapes while they take a dip.</p>

<p>Moving indoors the interiors have an old-world feel, taking inspiration from the vessel's name after legendary Viking, Ragnar Lodbrok or Lothbrok.  </p>
