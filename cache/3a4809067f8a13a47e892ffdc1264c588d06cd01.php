<p>The whole extended Ambrosio family was invited to relax and celebrate, as her parents Lucilda and Luiz were in attendance as well as her cousins.  </p>

<p>The veteran model paid tribute to her 'ray of sunshine' with a series of posts and documented the celebratory family outing on her social media.  </p>

<p>Before jetting to the Maldives, Alessandra and her family had been locked down in their Santa Monica, California home.</p>

<p>Ray of sunshine: Alessandra wished her daughter Anja, 12 happy birthday in adorable photos surrounded by pink, blue and yellow balloons as well as birthday treats during the trip</p>

<p>Last week the swimsuit designer was seen getting a COVID test with her daughter ahead of their international travels to make sure everything was copacetic before departing. </p>

<p>With the modeling industry slowly starting to ramp up again Alesandra will no doubt be back to work soon though she has been loving being at home with her family.</p>

<p>In the meantime she has found ways to get creative with her career and swimsuit line, as she has been modeling her latest designs from the comfort of her own home. </p>

<p>Fashion GAL: Earlier this month she was seen in an Infinity bikini in gold from her brand GAL Floripa. She started the line in 2019 with 'soul sisters' Gisele Cória and Aline Ambrosio </p>
