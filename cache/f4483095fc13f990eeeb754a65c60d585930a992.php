<p>Columnist Rebecca Traister was seen sipping wine during a Zoom chat with MSNBC's Chris Hayes late on Friday night</p>

<p>Traister was discussing the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday evening at the age of 87</p>

<p>'True respect to the panelist who's just anxiously drinking wine right now on MSNBC. I'm right there with you,' another wrote. </p>

<p>'This b***h on MSNBC being interview on MSNBC about RBG is crying and drinking wine wine on screen and literally same,' a fourth user chimed in. </p>

<p>Traister confirmed to The New York Post on Saturday morning that she was indeed drinking alcohol on the air, stating: 'Yes, it was wine. I got the news while [about Ginsburg's death] at dinner with my family, got the call to be on Chris's show soon after, and without thinking about it, brought my beverage with me.'</p>

<p>The notable columnist appeared to enjoy the attention that stemmed from her accidentally-viral moment, as she retweeted the clip. </p>

<p>She added above: ''L'shana tova. May her memory be a blessing. And may this year bring the drive and determination to fight like fury because everything depends on our willingness to do so.' </p>

<p>The moment quickly went viral on Twitter. Traister chimed in, telling her followers to 'fight' following news of Ginsburg's death</p>

<p>Before Ginsburg's death, the Supreme Court had a 5-4 conservative majority. </p>

<p>Ginsburg - who was nominated to the Court by President Bill Clinton back in 1993 - was known as the most liberal Justice on the bench.  </p>

<p>Democrats now fear Trump will be able to nominate another conservative Justice to the bench, effectively installing a 6-3 conservative majority that could be in place for decades and will push the country to the far right. </p>

<p>Ginsburg died Friday evening at the age of 87 following a long battle with cancer.  </p>
