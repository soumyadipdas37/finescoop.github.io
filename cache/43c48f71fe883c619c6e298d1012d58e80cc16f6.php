<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brie Larson revealed she turned down the role of Captain Marvel at first, because she didn't think she could 'handle that' kind of pressure.</p>

<p>The actress, 30, spoke candidly about the audition process for the Marvel's first female-led film during a video on her YouTube channel, which she shared with fans on Thursday.</p>

<p>Detailing how she was working on Kong: Skull Island in Australia at the time, she said: 'I remember them calling and saying my role and if I was interested in playing Captain Marvel? I said "Oh I can't do that, I have too much anxiety, that's too much for me, I don't think I can handle that so tell them no."</p>

<p>Candid: Brie Larson revealed in a YouTube video on Thursday that she originally TURNED DOWN the role of Captain Marvel as she thought she 'couldn't handle' the pressure of the part</p>

<p>'And my team were like "okay sure", and then a couple of months later they told me "hey they called again are you sure?" and I was like "yea I'm too much of an introvert, that's way too big of a thing for me, it was beyond my comprehension and no". </p>

<p>'Then they called a third time to ask if I was sure, so the point is every time I was saying no, and I thought my team were telling them no, they were not because I think they were thinking she would be great at this.'</p>

<p>Brie went on to explain that she has trouble working on more than one project at a time as she 'can't think of anything else', which meant her agents felt the need to wait until she was done filming Kong to ask her about Captain Marvel again.</p>

<p>Struggle: When she was offered the part she remembered telling her agents: '"I have too much anxiety, that's too much for me, I don't think I can handle that so tell them no"</p>

<p>Thoughts: She added, 'My team were like "okay sure", and then a couple of months later they told me "hey they called again are you sure?" and I was like "yea I'm too much of an introvert"'</p>

<p>'Time skips ahead and I'm back from filming, I had a meeting with [Marvel] and they had a pitch and they had a mock-up of the costume and I was very moved by what they were trying to achieve, what they were talking about, and it felt very progressive. </p>

<p>'I was very surprised by that, by the way that they were talking about feminism, the way they were handling it. </p>

<p>'They were like all female writers, female director, gonna have as many female voices in this as possible.'</p>

<p>She went on: 'Part of what was amazing about it and scary about it was that I wasn't allowed to talk to anybody about it.</p>

<p>Not a multi-tasker: Brie was working on Kong: Skull Island (pictured) at the time, and explained that she 'can't think of anything else', so her agents waited til she was done filming to ask again</p>

<p>Convinced: Brie explained, 'Back from filming I had a meeting with [Marvel] and they had a pitch and a mock-up of the costume and I was very moved by what they were trying to achieve'</p>

<p>'Looking back on it I don't think the Marvel police was going to come to my home if I told my mum, but I'm such a goody goody I couldn't tell anyone about it.</p>

<p>'So I thought about it and the next step was I said I really want to meet with the writers, let me talk to them and see if the story makes sense. </p>

<p>'To me I don't need to be that, that's a whole level of fame that I never expected to participate in and I thought okay the only way this works is if I believe in the story and the message it has and if that's the case then okay, this is here and it's happening, so it would be against the flow if I said no.'</p>

<p>Progressive: Brie (pictured with co-star Lashana Lynch) said of the meeting: 'They were like all female writers, female director, gonna have as many female voices in this as possible'</p>

<p>Delighted: Of their meeting, Brie added, 'I was very surprised by that, by the way that they were talking about feminism, the way they were handling it'</p>

<p>Brie described her meeting with the writers as 'amazing' as she 'loved everything they had to say' and believed in the story they were trying to tell.</p>

<p>'I remember going home thinking oh my god, I'm going to do this,' she added. 'I remember exactly where I was, I was in my dining room and I was staring at my really crappy bookshelf that I got from Salvation Army, still a broke actor, and I thought oh my god, I'm going to do this.</p>

<p>'Then I agreed, and I remember laughing a lot, I remember my team being really proud of me because they knew it was a big step for me in embodying myself, believing I could do something so big, in my confidence as a leader, in the belief in storytelling.'</p>

<p>Moved: Brie described her meeting with the writers as 'amazing' as she 'loved everything they had to say' and believed in the story they were trying to tell</p>

<p>And the rest is history: 'Then I agreed, and I remember laughing a lot, I remember my team being really proud of me because they knew it was a big step for me,' Brie added</p>

<p>Detailing the aftermath of accepting the role, she went on: 'After that I didn't tell anybody, I had friends texting me saying you're going to be Captain Marvel that's amazing and I said I don't know what you're talking about. </p>

<p>'I was so scared, it felt really good when I was on the stage at Comic Con and it was open, of course I had to hold many secrets after that about what it was about and all that, but at least I was placed as Captain Marvel.'</p>

<p>Brie is set to return to her superhero role in an as-yet-untitled Captain Marvel sequel, which will be released in 2022.</p>
