<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured) said NSW and South Australia are set to be the first states to welcome New Zealand tourists as part of a travel bubble</p>

<p>The arrangement will initially be only one-way, allowing Kiwis to fly across the Tasman (pictured,Â Sydney International Airport on September 29)</p>

<p>'New Zealanders being able to travel to Australia - that's good for Australian tourism.'</p>

<p>The prospect of Australians travelling to New Zealand is further away.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison said South Australia and NSW would be the first to benefit because they have already removed domestic borders.</p>

<p>'That would take a lot of pressure off at the airports for hotel quarantine, which frees up more places for Australians to come home,' he said.</p>

<p>The prime minister explained states insisting on quarantine for domestic travel would not be included in the bubble.</p>

<p>New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (pictured) discussed the trans-Tasman bubble with Mr Morrison earlier in the week</p>

<p>'We can't have New Zealand tourists coming and taking up those quarantine places in those states,' he said.</p>

<p>'There is a chance that we could have Australia simply open to New Zealand because of our status and where we are right now, which is pretty good,' she told AAP on Wednesday.</p>
