<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In more than 96 minutes, Newcastle had failed to register a single shot on target on this trip to Tottenham.</p>

<p>Steve Bruce’s side were course to leave empty-handed – nothing less than their lack of ambition and threat deserved.</p>

<p>And then in the dying seconds, as this match petered towards Spurs victory, the officials gift-wrapped a point to the visitors courtesy of another farcical handball decision.</p>

<p>Callum Wilson scored a controversial late penalty as Newcastle snatched a 1-1 draw at Spurs</p>

<p>Spurs were left shocked as Eric Dier (far right) was deemed to have handled in stoppage time</p>

<p>Whether they’re applying the laws or not, the result is a joke.</p>

<p>On this occasion it was Eric Dier who was so cruelly punished by the slow motion replays and tiny monitors in Stockley Park.</p>

<p>Deep into stoppage time, Andy Carroll’s header hit his arm. Dier was facing the other way, his arm outstretched by the momentum of the challenge.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho stormed down the tunnel after Callum Wilson's late and controversial penalty</p>

<p>But no matter to referee. He gave a penalty, Callum Wilson converted it and Jose Mourinho stormed down the tunnel.</p>

<p>In the stands, Newcastle chief Mike Ashley let out a smirk. Elsewhere in the plush seats, Gareth Bale could do nothing as victory was snatched from his side in this new-look old home.</p>

<p>Lucas Moura had put Tottenham on course for victory, turning home Harry Kane’s low cross and reminding Mourinho of his own threat from the right flank.</p>

<p>Lucas Moura opened the scoring in the first-half for Jose Mourinho's side in north London</p>

<p>The Brazilian winger (far left) tapped home after good work from Harry Kane in the first-half</p>

<p>When he calms down, the Spurs boss can look forward to some pleasant dilemmas in the coming weeks even if the prospects of Dele Alli look bleaker by the day. He was again left out of the squad – even after Moussa Sissoko fell ill shortly before kick-off.</p>

<p>As for Newcastle, the scoreline belies just how one-sided this was. They were unambitious and ineffective - if only these goals were 5cm bigger, the game would have been over by half-time.</p>

<p>As it was, they were in the game until stoppage time, when Carroll rose to meet a free-kick from wide.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s unlikely victory on this ground last year came courtesy of a Joelinton goal and just 20 per cent possession. On both counts, more recent history suggested lightning would unlikely strike twice. And yet Bruce was happy to take that gamble, without rolling the dice.</p>

<p>His side set up camp inside their own half, inviting Spurs on.</p>

<p>In the opening 10 minutes the visitors managed just 16 per cent of the ball and still only Karl Darlow kept them on terms.</p>

<p>First he clawed away Giovani Lo Celso’s free-kick before scrambling to meet Kane’s rebound, too.</p>

<p>Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow was a busy man in north London, making several key stops</p>

<p>The England captain was denied again shortly after, when his back-post header was palmed clear.</p>

<p>The only surprise? It took another 15 minutes for the breakthrough to come. And for the fifth time in two league games, Kane played provider. His cross beat five bodies before Lucas turned the ball into the empty net.</p>

<p>That did little to change Newcastle’s approach – at least initially – but it did allow Spurs to move through the gears. Darlow was at full stretch to deny Kane once more after a short; only the woodwork denied Son after he let fly with two of his own curling efforts from distance.</p>

<p>Son Heung-Min hit the woodwork twice in the first-half as Spurs dominated the encounter </p>

<p>About the only impressive aspect of Newcastle’s display was how they managed to have so many bodies within such a small area and yet make so little dent on Spurs’ attacks.</p>

<p>Dier certainly seemed surprised at the space he was afforded when he missed a free header from a corner.</p>

<p>At the other end, only tumbleweed. Hugo Lloris was the sole player who enjoyed fewer first-half touches (4) than visiting No 9 Callum Wilson (9); Newcastle’s first sniff at goal came when Jonjo Shelvey sent a volley wide in first-half stoppage time.</p>

<p>The visitors did show small sniffs of attacking intent in the second half but it was still Spurs who looked the more likely.</p>

<p>Kane twice went close, while Lucas and Lo Celso were both denied by Darlow. Until the late penalty, the closest Newcastle had come was when Ben Davies kicked the ball off Hojbjerg and just wide of his own goal. That was until the officials lent the visitors a helping hand.</p>

<p>Earlier in the match, Son Heung-Min hit the woodwork twice in the first-half before being taken off at half-time due to fatigue, while Eric Dier missed a gilt-edged chance in the opening period.  </p>

<p>New loan signing Gareth Bale watched on from the stands as he prepares for the new season</p>

<p>Wow, what drama! Newcastle have somehow earned a point at the 11th hour through Callum Wilson's stoppage time penalty.</p>

<p>It was another controversial handball decision that saw the visitors awarded the spot kick, and Spurs coach Joao Sacremento was sent off after the full time whistle for appealing.</p>

<p>Tottenham will be speechless after that. They dominated the clash, stuck the woodwork twice and netted first through Lucas Moura. Expect fireworks from Jose Mourinho soon!</p>

<p>Thanks for following our coverage.</p>

<p>90+7min: It's a great penalty from Callum Wilson, and Newcastle look like they've stolen a point! Jose Mourinho is absolutely furious and stalked off the down tunnel. I'm sure we'll hear plenty about that very shortly.</p>

<p>90+4min: It's been given! Another example of that divisive handball call has seen Newcastle handed a chance to pinch an unlikely point right at the death!</p>

<p>90min: We're into five added minutes here! There's a VAR check for a potential handball by Eric Dier...</p>

<p>The lines are out on the monitor, and the officials are checking for a potential offside decision now.</p>

<p>89min: That's the closest Newcastle have come to scoring, and it was almost a Tottenham own goal!</p>

<p>A big flick on from Andy Carroll causes a mix-up between Ben Davies and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, and the full back's wild clearance strikes the midfielder before hurtling wide of the post. Hugo Lloris was beaten!</p>

<p>87min: Tottenham are edging closer to their second win of the season, but it hasn't been easy for them in this second half. Newcastle have proved much more combative, and will maybe still be dreaming of taking a point. Not long to go now, though.</p>

<p>83min: Jamal Lewis goes into the book after fouling Matt Doherty right on the edge of the box. The free kick from Erik Lamela forces Karl Darlow to palm over this crossbar from a difficult angle.</p>

<p>79min: Oh look, another change! Erik Lamela is on for the goalscorer Lucas Moura.</p>

<p>There's still a glimmer of hope for Newcastle here, but a worrying stat has just flashed up. They haven't managed a single shot on target since their win at West Ham in their first game of the season.</p>

<p>78min: Tottenham are just struggling to carve out those clear cut openings from the first half. Lucas Moura takes matters into his own hands, driving forward to the edge of the box and firing an effort against Federico Fernandez.</p>

<p>77min: Here comes Andy Carroll! Miguel Almiron is replaced by the towering target man.</p>

<p>76min: Jose Mourinho also makes a change. Giovani Lo Celso has been hooked off in place of Tanguy Ndombele. </p>

<p>73min: Jeff Hendrick has been replaced by Jacob Murphy for Newcastle.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has just received a minor ticking off after bursting to the edge of the touchline and urging Matt Doherty to race back after losing the ball. Shades of his Soccer Aid tackle, that.</p>

<p>70min: Matt Doherty is involved again down the right side straight away. The full back's cross bounces horribly inside the box, although Steven Bergwijn can only hook an effort into the arms of Karl Darlow.</p>

<p>68min: Newcastle are forced into a change. Jamal Lewis has replaced Matt Ritchie, who is unable to continue after a very heavy collision.</p>

<p>The winger was struck by Matt Doherty's elbow while challenging for a header, and appears to have injured his shoulder during the landing.</p>

<p>64min: Giovani Lo Celso forces Karl Darlow into action against with an effort from outside the box. Tottenham then appeal for a penalty when Harry Kane's ball back in struck Jamal Lascelles on the elbow. The officials were unmoved.</p>

<p>62min: Jeff Hendrick is teed up from distance by Miguel Almiron after a superb Newcastle move down the left, but his powerful strike is wild and hurtled well wide of the far post. Matt Ritchie and Joelinton had combined well down the flank before the visitors moved infield. </p>

<p>60min: Harry Kane snatches at an effort from close range and Karl Darlow is able to collect comfortably down low. Lucas Moura won the first ball after an arching cross into the box, and the little forward teed up his team-mate with a clever header.</p>

<p>56min: This is better from Newcastle. Joelinton picks up a corner from the right side, travels into the box and pulls a strike from a very tight angle wide of the far post. </p>

<p>53min: Joelinton is the next player to pick up a caution after tracking back and felling Lucas Moura.</p>

<p>52min: Matt Ritchie picks up the ball on the left-hand side of the Tottenham box and cannons an effort towards goal.</p>

<p>Matt Doherty stands his ground well and blocks, although the Newcastle wideman loudly appeals for handball. VAR briefly checks the incident and signals for play to continue.</p>

<p>50min: Giovani Lo Celso's corner is whipped menacingly towards the front post, and Lucas Moura edges in to flick a header towards goal. Karl Darlow's handling is superb at the foot of the upright, however.</p>

<p>48min: Harry Kane gets a glimpse of goal within the opening minute, but is only able to drag his effort across the face of goal. An attempted through ball over the top took a wicked deflection and fell kindly for the Spurs man on the left of the box.</p>

<p>46min: We're back underway in north London!</p>

<p>Tottenham have made a change at the break - Son Heung-min has been replaced by Steven Bergwijn.</p>

<p>Newcastle have emerged with the same players that started, although Steve Bruce will surely have ripped into most of them.</p>

<p>It's been a weekend for great saves, but even Karl Darlow was eventually beaten after a string of fine saves kept out Tottenham.</p>

<p>Lucas Moura netted the opener at the far post from Harry Kane's superb ball across goal, and Son Heung-min has clattered the woodwork twice.</p>

<p>Newcastle have struggled and need a stern dressing room inquest to get anything from this one.</p>

<p>Join us shortly!</p>

<p>45min: We're into two added minutes at the end of this first half.</p>

<p>This has been a procession so far for the home side.</p>

<p>Newcastle did carve out the last chance before the break, however, after Jonjo Shelvey fired wide of the far post when Tottenham struggled to clear a corner.</p>

<p>44min: Jonjo Shelvey has been booked to add to Newcastle's frustrations. The midfielder clattered through Giovani Lo Celso and claimed he had got the ball first, but referee Peter Bankes was unmoved.</p>

<p>It would be very surprising if Steve Bruce doesn't make changes at the break.</p>

<p>42min: Maybe Leandro Trossard won't be feeling so bad today, because Son Heung-min has struck the woodwork for a second time! He's afforded space and time to pick his spot on the edge of the box and crashes against the crossbar. So unfortunate.</p>

<p>40min: Harry Kane, desperate for that elusive goal, terrorises Jeff Hendrick inside the box before swivelling sharply and firing a shot into the side netting.</p>

<p>37min: Newcastle are trying to get a foothold in this one now. Joelinton does superbly to weave through several challenges and break into the box, but he's dispossessed after finding no support around him.</p>

<p>34min: Eric Dier should have scored! The defender alludes his marker with ease and meets a corner from Son Heung-min full on, but he can only guide his header wide. Karl Darlow is furious, to say the least.</p>

<p>30min: The hosts are absolutely rampant. Son Heung-min has just struck the woodwork with a bending effort after being teed up once again by Harry Kane on the edge of the box.</p>

<p>Just moments earlier, Kane was also denied for a third time by Karl Darlow after being found unmarked from Son's corner. Newcastle have to tighten up, or they will be blow away.</p>

<p>25min: It's far too easy for Tottenham, and they have a deserved lead! Harry Kane breaks down the left side after picking the ball up from Son Heung-min, and the striker then plays an incisive delivery across goal for Lucas Moura to stab home on the slide at the far post.</p>

<p>22min: Matt Doherty steers behind for a corner at the other end, but Jonjo Shelvey's set piece was woeful and allowed the first man to clear with ease. Jamal Lascelles fell in a heap on the edge of the box after catching a stray hand in the face, but a brief VAR check deems there was nothing doing.</p>

<p>20min: Matt Doherty races inside the area on the right flank and is robbed of the ball by Jonjo Shelvey. Newcastle then aim towards Callum Willson on the same side, but the hoist forward is poor and the hosts immediately regain possession.</p>

<p>16min: Harry Kane once again climbs highest inside the box to divert Son Heung-min's delivery towards the middle of goal, and Karl Darlow is able to collect ahead of Davinson Sanchez.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>14min: Newcastle really haven't got started here yet. Apart from one foray forward, which saw Matt Doherty marshal Callum Wilson away, the visitors have been unable to threaten.</p>

<p>When they do manage to counter, the final ball into the channels have been lacking so far. Plenty to work on, and plenty of time left.</p>

<p>9min: Harry Kane will be wondering how he hasn't scored yet. Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg digs out a wonderful cross for the Tottenham talisman, who has drifted between two defenders, and his header is palmed away sharply by Karl Darlow.</p>

<p>6min: Tottenham have started this one on the front foot. They have been brilliantly fluid in every area, with their forwards combining sharply and causing the Newcastle backline all sorts of problems. Jose Mourinho will be hoping for plenty more of this.</p>

<p>4min: Wow, Karl Darlow is forced into a spectacular double save from the set piece! It is Giovani Lo Celso who steps up after being tugged back, and his effort curls around the wall and is palmed clear by the Newcastle stopper.</p>

<p>Harry Kane is quickest with the follow up, but Darlow is able to fling himself forward again and prevent Spurs from taking a very early lead!</p>

<p>2min: Jonjo Shelvey pulls back Giovani Lo Celso right on the edge of the box, and Tottenham are awarded a very dangerous looking free kick.</p>

<p>1min: We're underway in north London!</p>

<p>'Is the club trying to build that balanced squad that we all want, yes we are trying. Let's see if that's possible.'</p>

<p>The glaring omission from that Tottenham squad is, once again, Dele Alli. Restored to the starting lineup for Europa League action on Thursday night in Macedonia, he has been left out entirely this afternoon.</p>

<p>Since being hooked at half-time of Spurs' opening game against Everton a fortnight ago, he hasn't featured in the Premier League. The questions around his future continue to grow.</p>
