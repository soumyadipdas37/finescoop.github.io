<p>One Weibo, the Chinese equivalent to Twitter, one viewer commented: 'Has Hogwarts finally come to China to recruit students?' Footage of the 'floating Hogwarts' has gone viral online</p>

<p>Some people related the scene to Hebei Academy of Fine Arts, a college in northern China that bears a striking resemblance to Hogwarts. The above picture shows the college in 2019</p>

<p>The unusual spectacle was believed to be a mirage, a form of illusion that is common in humid weather, the Jinan Times reported.</p>

<p>The phenomenon is caused when moisture in the air becomes warmer than the temperature of the water below.</p>

<p>As the rays of sunlight cross from the colder air into the warmer air, it is 'bent' or refracted - creating a reflection in the air.</p>

<p>The patterns in the mirage are typically blurred and shimmering with a resemblance to human structures. They are similar to a reflection seen in the water.</p>

<p>Some locals believed that the 'floating Hogwarts' was the reflection of a residential estate situated two kilometres (1.2 miles) away. The community consists of buildings in a similar architectural style.</p>
