<p>The Vulcan Reporter claims that Hardy had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition, while bookies odds on the star have now been slashed in half.</p>

<p>However, due to the coronavirus pandemic the Vulcan Reporter state the announcement will now be made later this year or early 2021.</p>

<p>Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: 'A flurry of bets over the past 24 hours suggests the cat is out the bag and it's Tom Hardy that'll soon be replacing Daniel Craig as 007.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Tom's representatives and EON Productions for comment.</p>

<p>The Taboo star has made no secret about wanting to be the next 007 - but has previously refused to talk about the part in fear it will get him blacklisted.</p>

<p>Main man: Daniel Craig plays Bond for the fifth and final time in No Time To Die</p>

<p>Speaking to the Daily Beast, the heart-throb admitted: 'If I mention it, it's gone.</p>

<p>'You know, there's a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting, and in the fellowship of my peer group, that if you talk about it you're automatically out of the race.</p>

<p>'So I can't possibly comment on that one!'</p>

<p>Well up for it: The Taboo star has made no secret about wanting to be the next 007 - but has previously refused to talk about the part in fear it will get him blacklisted</p>
