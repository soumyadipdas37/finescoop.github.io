<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of the few treats of post-lockdown football was to see Wycombe clinch an unlikely promotion at Wembley and witness another of Adebayo Akinfenwa's unashamedly jubilant post-match interviews.</p>

<p>Akinfenwa bubbled and fizzed in his inimitable way, posing his own questions and knocking out the answers a split-second later, high on the thrill of his ascent to the Championship in the twilight of his career.</p>

<p>Then he told Jurgen Klopp to 'hit me up on WhatsApp' and the watching Liverpool boss could not resist such enthusiasm. He asked Jordan Henderson to find a number and promptly called.</p>

<p>Adebayo Akinfenwa will play in the Championship for the first time in his career at age of 38</p>

<p>The charismatic striker recieved a call from Jurgen Klopp after Wycombe clinched promotion</p>

<p>'It all just came pouring out,' smiles Akinfenwa as he recalls the triumph, that interview and the message from Klopp. 'I was caught up in the emotion because, you know what, we did it.</p>

<p>'At 38, I realised how long and hard I had worked to get there. I remember losing the play-off final with Swansea when I was 24 and thinking, "Don't worry, next season we'll get to the Champ".</p>

<p>'It took me 14 years. This time we got over the line and there was an outpouring because at the start of the season they were predicting we would finish below Bolton, who were starting with a 12-point deduction.</p>

<p>'It was nice to say, "We didn't need your belief because we believed", and all these emotions came out, but I couldn't remember anything until I watched it.</p>

<p>'The only thing I was sure I said was the Klopp line. It is humbling to know the manager of the club I supported all my life sent a message and now I have his number. So, if I need to chat to the best manager in the world, or the second best because Gareth Ainsworth is probably reading this, I will message him.'</p>

<p>It was Wycombe boss Ainsworth who phoned after Akinfenwa's post-match interview at Wembley in 2016. The striker had just scored in his last game for AFC Wimbledon and was celebrating a League Two play-off final victory when he said: 'I'm technically unemployed, so any managers, hit me up on WhatsApp.'</p>

<p>The striker said finally getting to the second tier at his 14th club was not expected</p>

<p>Ainsworth did and Akinfenwa joined his 14th club, where he would be more successful than anywhere else in a wandering career featuring rejection at Watford as a teenager and spells with FK Atlantas in Lithuania and Barry Town in the Welsh Premier League. 'I'd be lying if I said I mapped out this path. Or that I set out to be different. I set out to be me.'</p>

<p>With that, Akinfenwa is off again, answering his own questions at terrific speed. 'Did I think I'd still be playing at 38? Probably not, but I've always had self-belief. Even when I was released by Wimbledon, I knew I had stuff to give. But I never thought I'd join Wycombe and become their record scorer in the EFL.'</p>

<p>He has won two promotions there, scoring 54 league goals — a record for a club promoted to the Football League in 1993.</p>

<p>'My stats in the last four years equal my stats in my previous 10. Did I think I'd still be hitting these numbers at 38? No. But I knew my strengths and I was linking up with a manager who focused on those rather than my weaknesses. You don't see me getting into a foot race. I rarely do stepovers. I don't come out of my lane.</p>

<p>'As I've got older, I'm more comfortable with myself as an individual and a footballer, and the earlier you can find the person you are, the better you will be. That's the advice I give to young pros: find out what you're good at and embrace it.'</p>

<p>Ainsworth is another of football's great nonconformists, still playing Sunday League, fronting a band and patrolling the touchline in snakeskin boots and leather jacket. During lockdown, he dressed up as Gene Simmons of Kiss to host an online quiz for fans of QPR, one of his old clubs.</p>

<p>'I'm not a great fan of how he dresses,' joked Akinfenwa. 'But I love the thought process behind it because he is being him. I love his character. We get on so well. I am unconventional and he doesn't fit the managerial stereotypes. You could say the same about Klopp. We shouldn't all be the same. The gaffer is not and he should never change. That's his greatest strength.'</p>

<p>Akinfenwa praised the character of Chairboys manager Gareth Ainsworth (L) </p>

<p>Ainsworth has made Akinfenwa the inspirational talisman at Wycombe and channelled his natural exuberance into building the spirit which fuelled their rise.</p>

<p>He also made sure the centre forward signed a new one-year contract after promotion, despite his age and a knee operation which rules him out of the opener against Rotherham on Saturday.</p>

<p>'There is not one game this season we are expected to win,' said Akinfenwa. 'That plays into our hands: the underdogs. The fixtures came out and we were going, "Woah, Derby, Forest, Sheffield Wednesday". It is beautiful. We will do it our way. Bring our sauce. Our sauce is our weight. The aim is to consolidate in the league but that doesn't mean we can't make a noise.'</p>

<p>EFL on Quest returns at 9pm tomorrow and throughout the season on Wednesdays at 10.30pm for midweek fixtures. Stream live and catch-up on dplay.  </p>
