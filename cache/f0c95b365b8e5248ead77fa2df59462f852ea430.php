<p>Vintage Kimmy: Kim Kardashian dug deep into her photo archives for an Instagram post on Thursday. The 39-year-old siren was seen in a teeny Burberry bikini with a Band-Aid on her chest as she wore wraparound sunglasses</p>

<p>'Trifecta 2006 Watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians Season 19 tonight on E!' said the KKW Beauty mogul.</p>

<p>Kim looked much younger in the image with a fuller face and less makeup as her black hair was pulled back.</p>

<p>The mother-of-four appeared slender but she still put a hand over her stomach as she may have been a little self-conscious.</p>

<p>Kourtney, 41, had on a purple, pink and white bikini on as she failed to smile.</p>

<p>Thrice as nice: The wife of Kanye West was with her sisters Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian. The siren called the three of them the 'trifecta' as she urged her 188M followers to watch the season debut of her show Keeping Up With The Kardashians</p>

<p>Colors: Kourtney, 41, had on a purple, pink and white bikini on as she failed to smile. And Khloe was in a lime green bikini with her dark hair worn down and oversized sunglasses on</p>

<p>And Khloe was in a lime green bikini with her dark hair worn down and oversized sunglasses on.</p>

<p>The trip seemed to be on a yacht at the time. </p>

<p>The year was 2006 and their TV show KUWTK had just debuted making her family instantly famous.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the family announced the show would end in 2021 after 20 seasons.</p>

<p>The debut of season 19 should be fascinating as Kim was heard in a trailer asking Kourtney if she is having a fourth child with her ex Scott Disick.</p>

<p>Kourt and Scott have been spending a lot of time together this year, especially after he split from Sofia Richie, causing fans to wonder if they are back on. They already have Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five.</p>

<p>And the POOSH founder is also seen being asked point blank if she is pregnant again to which she gives a deer-in-headlights look.</p>

<p>She spilled: Kim states in the supertease for the next season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians that Scott Disick told her he and Kourtney are trying for a fourth child</p>

<p>This surprising question is asked toward the end of the trailer.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian is seen in a crochet top by a swimming pool as she says, 'Scott's like we're going for baby number four, is that serious I want to know.'</p>

<p>The faces of Kourtney, Khloe and Scott are all flashed as they appear to be at a family lunch on a patio of a mansion.</p>

<p>Well is it true? Scott does not seem to say anything as Kim makes her claim</p>

<p>Uh-oh: Kourtney is like a deer in headlights as she does not want to seem to answer</p>

<p>'Are you pregnant?' another voice is heard asking Kourtney.</p>

<p>Kourtney, who has on a red shirt with her dark hair half up, looks put on the spot and not happy about it. Her answer is not heard.</p>

<p>The eldest Kardashian seems to be single, though in 2019 she was linked to ex Younes Bendjima.</p>

<p>And Scott has been single for months now.</p>

<p>Aunty Khloe shoots that look: Khloe looks up at big sister Kourtney for some information</p>

<p>So it is likely that the two may be back together. In the past, Kourtney has said she would 'love' to have another child and prays for it.</p>

<p>Kourtney and Scott started dating in 2006 after meeting at Joe Francis' house in Mexico and in 2007 he became a fixture on KUWTK.</p>

<p>In 2009 they welcomed their first child, son Mason.</p>

<p>They were on and off for years as Scott was accused many times of cheating on his partner; he also had to check into rehab more than once.</p>

<p>In 2014 she was linked to Justin Bieber, and in 2015 Kourtney pulled the plug on the relationship with Scott.</p>

<p>Disick moved on to Bella Thorne then Sofia while Kourtney spent time with Younes.</p>

<p>Will they be a family of six? They already have Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five</p>

<p>But by 2017, Kourtney and Scott were spending time together again during vacations as they promised to be mature about handling hand offs with the kids.</p>

<p>And in April of this year, Disick started liking old photos of Kourtney where she looked sexy. A trip to a lake this summer where she posed in a bikini caused fans to wonder if the two are back on. </p>

<p>Season 19 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres this Thursday, September 17 at 8pm ET/PT on E! and as previously announced, Season 20/The Final Season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians will air in early 2021. </p>
