<p>A woman who was stabbed to death by her 'very controlling' adult son before he killed himself had reported 17 previous incidents to the police.</p>

<p>Janice Woolford, 68, was found dead at the home she shared with her reclusive alcoholic son Michael, 44, in Tunstall, Sunderland, in February. </p>

<p>Woolford - who did not have a telephone, bank account, benefits or a job and very rarely left the house - stabbed his mother eight times before taking a fatal overdose of painkillers, the coroner was told. </p>

<p>The majority of her wounds were to the head and neck. </p>

<p>An inquest today heard that Mrs Woolford was subject to years of emotional and physical abuse from her son - including one incident where Woolford shot his mother in the face with an air rifle in 2003. </p>

<p>Their bodies were discovered after Mrs Woolford's colleagues at a local charity raised the alarm, the inquest at Sunderland Civic Centre heard.</p>

<p>Inquiries found that Woolford was 'very controlling' of his mother.</p>

<p>She had been a widow since her only child was 18 months old, ensuring she provided him with exactly what he wanted, and that he considered himself the man of the house.</p>

<p>As well as being emotionally abusive, he also physically harmed her, the hearing was told.</p>

<p>Northumbria Police recorded 17 incidents relating to the property in the past 22 years.</p>

<p>She later told a judge that it was accidental and that proceedings against her son should stop, and family members told police investigating her murder that she continually made excuses for him.</p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Euan Campbell, who led the police inquiry, said the force has since examined what help Mrs Woolford was offered.</p>

<p>He told the hearing: 'We specifically looked back at the 17 incidents.</p>

<p>'We can say it is documented throughout them that Janice has been offered referrals to support agencies a number of times as a result of incidents at the house and was also requested to make statements about what has gone on.</p>

<p>Woolford was found dead at the home she shared with her reclusive alcoholic son Michael, 44, in Tunstall, Sunderland, (file image, pictured) in February</p>

<p>'It is quite clear she would essentially report an incident, and if Michael was arrested it was at this point she would want no further involvement and she would want Michael released.</p>

<p>'She would say she had managed his behaviour since he was five and she didn't need any help.'</p>

<p>The inquest heard that Woolford had attended mainstream school and won a place at university but dropped out and was a reclusive alcoholic.</p>

<p>Assistant Coroner Karin Welch said: 'It seems clear she was a very independent, proud mother but that, effectively, this has ultimately led to her death because she obviously had difficulties with Michael.'  </p>

<p>She said Mrs Woolford's 'mother's instinct' must have made it 'doubly difficult to effectively walk away from the situation'.</p>

<p>The coroner recorded that Mrs Woolford was unlawfully killed and her son's death was suicide.</p>
