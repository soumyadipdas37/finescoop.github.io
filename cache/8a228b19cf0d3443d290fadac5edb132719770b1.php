<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kylian Mbappe is more likely to sign a new deal with Paris Saint-Germain than join Liverpool or Real Madrid next summer, according to reports.</p>

<p>The striker is in the final two years of his contract with the French champions and there had been talk that the 21-year-old was considering his options amid interest from other clubs.</p>

<p>But French transfer expert Jonathan Johnson has told Sky Sports that Mbappe, who scored 30 goals in all competitions last season, is more likely to commit his future to PSG by signing an extension.</p>

<p>Kylian Mbappe is expected to sign a new deal with PSG rather than leave the club next summer</p>

<p>The striker is entering the final two years of his contract with the French side this season</p>

<p>'There's been a longstanding interest in Mbappe from Liverpool and Real Madrid,' Johnson explained.</p>

<p>'However, I don't see PSG giving Mbappe up easily. I think if they need to they would probably allow him to enter the final 12 months of his contract in a bid to try to persuade him to extend his stay with the club, particularly based on their performance in the Champions League last season.</p>

<p>'Kylian Mbappe is the future for this PSG project and I just don't see them giving him up without a fight. I don't think either of Real Madrid or Liverpool would be able to pay what PSG would even consider just to go to the table and negotiate next summer.</p>

<p>Liverpool and Real Madrid have shown interest in the striker but would struggle to afford him</p>

<p>'With the coronavirus situation looking like it's going to be here to stay for at least the next six to eight months, I think it's going to be very difficult for any club to be able to enter into negotiations with PSG so I think more signs point to a contract extension making sense for Mbappe than it does angling for a move to a Liverpool or a Real Madrid.' </p>

<p>As reported by Sportsmail, Liverpool did make contact with the representative of Mbappe in the summer of 2017, when the then Monaco star was preparing to make his first big move on the European stage. </p>

<p>But in November 2019, manager Jurgen Klopp said it would be virtually impossible for his side to bring the World Cup winner to Anfield.</p>

<p>'(Buying) this calibre of player is difficult. I don't see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG.</p>

<p>'I don't see any club, that is how it is. We are involved in the clubs that cannot do it - it is as easy as that.</p>

<p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp previously said there is no chance the Reds could afford Mbappe</p>

<p>'OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign him - what a player he is! It is about the money, of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance.'</p>

<p>Real boss Zinedine Zidane is also thought to be an admirer of Mbappe but the LaLiga side have been hit by the financial impact of the on-going pandemic.</p>

<p>President Florentino Perez confirming there would be no big signings this summer and it remains to be seen whether they would be able to afford the Frenchman in 2021.</p>
