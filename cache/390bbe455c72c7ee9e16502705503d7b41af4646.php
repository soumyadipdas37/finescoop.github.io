<p>Wilson has been on Villa's striker shortlist for this window along with Brentford's Ollie Watkins.</p>

<p>Villa, though, have struggled to make progress in their attempts to reunite Watkins with his former Griffin Park boss Dean Smith and are ready to pursue a move for Wilson.</p>

<p>Aston Villa have stepped up their pursuit of Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson</p>

<p>Brentford are holding out for £25m for Watkins, scorer of 26 goals for the Championship play-off runners up, compared to Villa's initial £18m valuation.</p>

<p>Newcastle are also making a push for Wilson, 28, while Crystal Palace are monitoring the situation too.</p>

<p>Bournemouth have lost defender Nathan Ake to Manchester City and goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to Sheffield United following their relegation to the Championship.</p>

<p>But they are determined to retain as many of their key men as possible and also have no intention of selling anyone who does leave on the cheap.</p>

<p>However Wilson is keen to remain in the top flight with a view to earning a place in England's squad for next summer's Euros.</p>

<p>Brentfor have placed a £25million price tag on Villa transfer target Ollie Watkins</p>
