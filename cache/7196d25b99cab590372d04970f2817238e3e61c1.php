<p>Pictures have also emerged of the animal's body and also Mr Kootee's crumpled tent, which shows the aftermath of the devastating attack.</p>

<p>Blood splatters were seen close to the camp site, where six other people were sleeping, but not injured in the tragedy, according to local reports. </p>

<p>They have been offered counselling after being checked over at hospital and released a statement paying tribute to the victim, The Sun reports.</p>

<p>They wrote: 'We now need peace and that we are allowed to mourn our friend who is dead.</p>

<p>'We would like to thank the people of Longyearbyen and the Governor for their efforts and support during this difficult day.' </p>

<p>Dutch national Johan Jacobus Kootte was killed during the night while he was lying in his tent in a camping area (pictured today) near the town Longyearbyen, which is 800 miles from the North Pole, local officials said on Friday</p>

<p>The attack happened in a camp site near the town Longyearbyen, which is 1,300 kilometres (800 miles) from the North Pole</p>

<p>In Svalbard, which is also known as Spitzberg, people are advised to carry a weapon when outside urban areas.</p>

<p>According to a tally from 2015, the archipelago is home to about 1,000 polar bears, a protected species since 1973.</p>

<p>Until now, five deadly attacks on people had been recorded since 1971.</p>

<p>The most recent one occurred in 2011 when a bear attacked a group of 14 people camping as part of a British school trip. </p>

<p>A 17-year-old British student was killed and four others were injured before the animal was killed.</p>

<p>According to experts, the shrinking icecap has reduced the polar bears' preferred hunting grounds, where they eat seals, pushing them to approach populated areas in their hunt for food.</p>
