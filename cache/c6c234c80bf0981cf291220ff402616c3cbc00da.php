<p>Fraser Cameron, 73, (pictured) is being investigated on suspicion of passing information to Chinese spies posing as journalists</p>

<p>This led to investigations being opened by federal prosecutors in Brussels, according to local media reports.</p>

<p>However, it is unknown what charges, if any, would be brought against Mr Cameron, who is accused of passing information to two Chinese spies.</p>

<p>The spies were working as accredited journalists in Brussels while allegedly working for the Ministry of State Security, the country's intelligence agency. </p>

<p>Mr Cameron is accused of passing 'sensitive' but not classified information, which he had gained through important contacts.</p>

<p>He is the director of the EU-Asia Centre and worked for the European Commission for 14 years and left in 2005.</p>

<p>He denied being able to find information that was not already in the public domain, but says he has contacts with Chinese journalists and civil servants. </p>

<p>Mr Cameron worked for the European Commission for 14 years and left in 2005</p>

<p>Mr Cameron added that these contacts were part of his role running the EU-Asia Centre and 'other experts in Brussels' would have 'similar contacts'. </p>

<p>He said: 'It might be that some of them have a double function'.  </p>
