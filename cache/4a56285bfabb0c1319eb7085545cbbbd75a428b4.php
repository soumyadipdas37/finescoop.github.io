<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Actress and comedian Nikki Osborne is relocating her family to Queensland amid Melbourne's poor 'quality of life'.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! star will arrive in Brisbane on Monday with husband Jamie Starr and their children, after receiving a border pass.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Courier Mail on Saturday, the mother-of-two described life in Victoria under stage four restrictions as 'depressing'. </p>

<p>'It's depressing down here': Nikki Osborne (pictured), 39, told The Courier Mail on Saturday that she's relocating her family to Queensland amid Melbourne's poor 'quality of life'</p>

<p>Nikki, who was raised in Queensland and has lived in Victoria for 15 years, had her national comedy tour cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>

<p>'It's really depressing down here. All our friends' businesses are going bust and all my industry mates can't work... it's depressing watching your kids staring at a screen or a wall,' she told the publication.    </p>

<p>Nikki and her family will spend two weeks in mandatory hotel quarantine, and from there she hopes to secure work on productions in Queensland.  </p>

<p>Victoria just announced a record 59 new coronavirus deaths - its highest daily total during the pandemic - but the number of new cases is falling.</p>

<p>Life amid pandemic: 'It's really depressing down here. All our friends' businesses are going bust and all my industry mates can't work... it's depressing watching your kids staring at a screen or a wall,' the actress and comedian said </p>

<p>Health bosses recorded 87 new COVID-19 cases on Saturday, a marked drop compared to the 113 reported on Thursday.  </p>

<p>The latest figures come as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks.</p>

<p>While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked road map is 'out of date', Premier Daniel Andrews refused on Thursday to rule out continuing stage four restrictions.</p>

<p>'Everything is on the table,' Andrews said. 'It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.'  </p>

<p>Granted a border pass: Nikki and her family will spend two weeks in mandatory hotel quarantine, and from there she hopes to secure work on productions in Queensland. Pictured with husband Jamie Starr </p>

<p>Fifty of the deaths announced on Friday were people who had passed away in aged care in July and August, after a federal and state government review of previous deaths in facilities across the state. </p>

<p>According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date stage four comes to an end.  </p>

<p>Single people and single parents will also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.</p>

<p>According to the report, which was obtained by the Herald Sun, there are bigger changes coming from September 28, including the curfew being lifted and increased social gatherings.</p>

<p>But the Victorian Chamber of Commerce has denied there is a plan to extend stage four lockdown by two weeks - claiming it is out of date.</p>

<p>Criticism: Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured on Friday) has faced backlash for his draconian lockdown rules </p>
