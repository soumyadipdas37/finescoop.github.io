<p>'A fresh getup for dinner at Mauro’s. Clinging to it for dining sanity. It’s my one big evening out every so often...the light has been golden from the fires. But clearing,' she began.</p>

<p>'Also Fred Segal is an LA staple and more charming and appreciated than ever. Also! thanks <?php echo e('@'); ?>thealist.us for introducing me to my chic, light, crisp white uniform of <?php echo e('@'); ?>alexmillny,' she added.</p>

<p>The actress added it was a, 'playful cool space and land standard jumpsuit' at the end of her post. </p>

<p>Fresh getup: 'A fresh getup for dinner at Mauro’s. Clinging to it for dining sanity. It’s my one big evening out every so often...the light has been golden from the fires. But clearing,' she began</p>

<p>Her outing comes just two days after she penned a touching tribute to late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>

<p>'Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg . Small and determined, the notorious RBG will always be a leader for equal rights,' Blair began.</p>

<p>'A visionary. A titan of the law. An original. My mother, a magistrate in her own life was also determined and focused but RGB was a major player in our justice system in her own incredible life,' Blair added.</p>

<p>'She was radical and cool. She shook up preconceived notions pleasing supporters and skeptics alike. She was a true bipartisan. She could see both sides. May we remember this,' Blair said.</p>

<p>'What is good for the country. Her death on Rosh Hashanah makes her a tzaddik. A person of great righteousness. Peace upon you RBG. You earned it,' Blair concluded.</p>

<p>Blair will next be seen in After We Collided, which is slated for release on October 23. </p>
