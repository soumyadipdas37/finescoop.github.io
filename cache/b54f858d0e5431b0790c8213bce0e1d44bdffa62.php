<p>In a sweet Instagram post, Holly thanked Celebrity Juice for 12 years of 'fantastic chaos' as she left just five months after former Top of the Pops star Fearne, also 39.  </p>

<p>Insiders previously claimed the decision came as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers. </p>

<p>Although Holly had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.</p>

<p>She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term ‘Holly Willoughbooby’ was coined to described her curvaceous figure.</p>

<p>Her resignation came shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice’s creators – stopped producing the show. </p>

<p>Success: Celebrity Juice has proved to be enormously popular following its launch</p>
