<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>American private equity barons are circling Britain's largest office developers after their share prices collapsed by almost 50 per cent. </p>

<p>City sources said Blackstone, the Wall Street-based giant led by Stephen Schwarzman, is rumoured to be monitoring companies including Land Securities. </p>

<p>Blackstone wants to strike cut-price deals such as joint ventures, stake purchases and takeovers, the sources said. </p>

<p>Collapse: Land Securities owns office blocks in the City of London, Canary Wharf (pictured) and the West End</p>

<p>Land Securities is the largest listed real estate investment trust in the FTSE100 index. It owns office blocks in the City of London, Canary Wharf and the West End. </p>

<p>Its shares have crashed from almost £10 earlier this year to close at £5.78 on Friday amid concern about the future for office working in the wake of Covid-19. A number of major firms have told their staff they need not return to the office full-time until 2021. </p>

<p>Blackstone has experience of picking up British commercial property on the cheap and making a quick profit. </p>

<p>After the financial crisis in 2009 Blackstone struck a deal with British Land to buy a stake in Broadgate, the 30-acre City of London office estate that houses Swiss bank UBS. </p>

<p>The American buyout house formed a joint venture with British Land for Broadgate, with its 50 per cent stake valued at around £1billion. Three and a half years later Blackstone sold its shareholding to Singapore-based sovereign wealth fund GIC for almost £1.7billion, meaning the American firm made around £700million. </p>

<p>Brookfield, the Canadian investment house that specialises in property deals, has already pounced on one well-known developer during the pandemic. </p>

<p>In June, it paid £264million for a 7 per cent stake in British Land, which last week was on the cusp of being demoted from the FTSE100 index. </p>

<p>Aside from Broadgate, British Land owns London office space at Regent's Place and Paddington Central. </p>

<p>Brookfield, which has a market capitalisation of $52billion (£39billion, has a track record in carrying out major UK property deals. </p>

<p>In 2015, it teamed up with the Qatar Investment Authority to buy Songbird Estates, the owner of Canary Wharf, for £2.6billion. </p>

<p>British Land shares closed at £3.65 on Friday. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Blackstone declined to comment.</p>
