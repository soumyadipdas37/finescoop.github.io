<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle United new boys Callum Wilson and Jeff Hendrick both scored on their debuts to inflict more misery on poor West Ham.</p>

<p>Wilson showed the cutting edge of a £20million striker when he reacted quicker than goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski to stab home a close-range finish after 56 minutes. And former Burnley midfielder Hendrick wrapped the points up late on with a sweet finish.</p>

<p>West Ham didn’t really deserve any better though they did strike the woodwork twice and had a couple of penalty appeals denied for handball.</p>

<p>With Arsenal, Tottenham, Liverpool and Manchester City to play before the end of October, it already looks a miserable start to the season and their watching owners David Sullivan and David Gold were probably relieved the stadium was empty rather than have to run the gauntlet from fans.</p>

<p>Expectations in both camps were low before kick off following a summer of discontent.</p>

<p>West Ham skipper Mark Noble went public with his “gutted, angry and sad” reaction to the club selling winger Grady Diangana to West Brom while a small group of fans protested against owners David Sullivan and David Gold outside the London Stadium before kick off.</p>

<p>Newcastle aren’t in much better shape with their owner Mike Ashley threatening legal action after the Premier League blocked his proposed sale to Saudi investors.</p>

<p>To add to the gloom, West Ham hadn’t won an opening-day fixture since 2015, Newcastle in 2012.</p>

<p>Steve Bruce had been the busier manager in the transfer window and gave full debuts to new signings Callum Wilson, Jamaal Lewis and Jeff Hendrick with Ryan Fraser on the bench.</p>

<p>Former Hammer Andy Carroll was given a rare chance to start at his old stomping ground.</p>

<p>West Ham boss Moyes had made only one “addition” turning Tomas Soucek’s loan into a permanent deal.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, it was a pleasing first half under the floodlights, with both sides creating plenty of chances without showing the cutting edge to go in front.</p>

<p>While some stadiums suffer from a lack of atmosphere, West Ham seem to play with more freedom in front of empty seats rather than hear the usual groans from disillusioned fans.</p>

<p>Even so, Newcastle made the brighter start with Wilson heading over the bar and then flashing a curler wide.</p>

<p>Jonjo Shelvey, who grew up at West Ham fan, missed a chance to make his boyhood heroes pay when he slashed at a finish from inside the box, while Carroll was always a threat in the air, and went close after displaying nifty footwork ahead of a half-volley.</p>

<p>West Ham were more functional but could count to the better opportunities.</p>

<p>Mark Noble’s free-kick was headed on to the top of the cross bar by Angel Ogbonna while Michail Antonio forced Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow, playing his first Premier League game since 2018 and clad all in pink, into a save.</p>

<p>Pablo Fornals screamed for a penalty when Toon skipper Jamaal Lascelles deflected his shot on to the bar but VAR ruled that any handball was accidental.</p>

<p>Jarrod Bowen looked anguished when he skied a cross by Ryan Fredericks over the crossbar with the interval approaching. Fredericks was showing good courage to get forward when he could despite having to try and also stop Newcastle speedster Alain Saint-Maximin at the other end.</p>

<p>Just like they had in the first half, Newcastle started the second period brighter with Ryan Fredericks flicking the ball off Carroll’s foot as he smelt a chance from six yards.</p>

<p>Saint-Maximin wriggled past Soucek on the wing and when he tried to accelerate away from Fredericks, the right-back brought him down to earn a booking.</p>

<p>While Moyes appears to have prioritised Burnley’s James Tarkowski as his top transfer target, it was the top end of the pitch where his side struggled most yesterday.</p>

<p>In contrast, Newcastle’s frontline combined well together and they full deserved the lead taken after 56 minutes.</p>

<p>Full-back Javier Manquillo ventured forward and his cross deflected off the outstretched boot of Fornals and looped dangerously into the penalty area.</p>

<p>Hendrick reacted quickest by nodding along the six-yard-box and Wilson stuck out his leg to turn the ball over the line to pay off the first instalment of his £20million transfer fee from Bournemouth, for whom he scored 67 goals.</p>

<p>Moyes responded by sending on centre-forward Sebastien Haller and Andriy Yarmolenko with Mark Noble and Pablo Fornals making way midway through the second half</p>

<p>Immediately, there was a goalmouth scramble which saw Haller’s cross strike Hendrick on the arm. The Hammers yelled “penalty” for the second time in the evening but with the Irishman’s arm by his side, it was not given, to the displeasure of a glaring Moyes.</p>

<p>Newcastle rubbed further salt into the wound when they sealed victory after 87 minutes.</p>

<p>Substitute Miguel Almiron squared a pass to Hendrick and he thumped a comprehensive finish past Fabianski from eight yards.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>90+2min: Into five added minutes and West Ham need two goals. Forget it. They could play all night and still be no closer to troubling Karl Darlow.</p>

<p>89min: Final changes for both teams as Sean Longstaff replaces Andy Carroll for Newcastle while West Ham send on Felipe Anderson for Jarrod Bowen.</p>

<p>87min: What a night for Newcastle. That's two debutants off the mark now as Jeff Hendrick collects a low cross from Almiron on the edge of the box before drilling home. The Three points are heading to the North East.</p>

<p>85min: Second change for Newcastle as Miguel Almiron replaces Calum Wilson.</p>

<p>81min: They are starting to force Newcastle United back though, in what is probably their most impressive spell of the game. The Toon having dropped a little deep.</p>

<p>78min: This is when we miss having football fans inside grounds. What would West Ham fans be like right now? There has been plenty of apathy surrounding the club and its (lack of) transfer dealings in the summer and they have done little in this game as we head towards the final 10 minutes. Cheers or jeers at this point when the Hammers clearly need a lift?</p>

<p>75min: And that is Saint-Maximin's last contribution of the game as he walks off the pitch to be replaced before he is kicked odd it, with Joelinton replacing him.</p>

<p>74min: This game has not really had the same punch as the first half and West Ham continue to well... not do too much. Alllan Saint-Maximin fires just over the bar from inside the box.</p>

<p>71min: Tomas Soucek is booked for chopping down Allan Saint-Maximin (who is going to be a little sore tomorrow judging by the kicks he has taken this evening). </p>

<p>The only problem is it was Andriy Yarmolenko who did the deed. A quick VAR review confrims this and justice is done as the Ukrainian collects the caution instead.</p>

<p>68min: Instant impact from Haller as his shot driven on goal appears to be blocked on the line by Hendrick'a arm. It looks accidental enough and VAR seems to agree... even if the West Ham bench does not as Nolan appeals to the fourth official.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Javi Manquillo is booked for a poor challenge on Jarrod Bowen.</p>

<p>67min: Here is that double change with Yarmolenko on for Mark Noble, while Sebastien Haller replaces Pablo Fornals. </p>

<p>63min: West Ham are going nowhere and after Moyes shares a discussion with his assistant Kevin Nolan, it looks like he is ready to make a double substitution - one of those coming on being Andriy Yarmolenko.</p>

<p>8 - Callum Wilson has scored eight goals in nine league games against West Ham, more than he has netted against any other side in his league career. Expected. pic.twitter.com/1u3PUcCphk</p>

<p>60min: No immediate changes from David Moyes, but he has now sent his substitutes to warm up so some fresh faces are likely to be on the way soon.</p>

<p>57min: It's a debut goal for Callum Wilson who with a poacher's raised foot beats Lukasz Fabianski to a near post cross from Javi Manquillo helped on by Jeff Hendrick. Wilson does love a goal against the Hammers and he is all smiles to get his Toon account up and running.</p>

<p>54min: As Declan Rice plays a poor ball out of play, David Moyes is left scratching his chin on the touchline as he tries to suss out a way to break Newcastle down.</p>

<p>Ryan Fredericks has found a way to break Allan Saint-Maximin down though, another hack similar to his first half attempt, sees him booked. He protests he got the ball - replays inconclusive on that one.</p>

<p>51min: West Ham seem to be trying to control the play more than they did in the first period. The passes are nice and crisp but there is no tempo or ambition with it. Newcastle are happy to sit back and wait for a mistake. This sadly does not make for much in the way of entertainment.</p>

<p>48min: Half-chance but no more from Newcastle. Andy Carroll and Callum Wilson haven't really gelled yet but the latter nearly finds the former via a deflected pass inside the box, only for the ball to evade the former England striker's outstretched leg.</p>

<p>Ryan Fraser had been warming up for the Toon ahead of a potential debut at half-time but no changes as we get underway again.</p>

<p>Newcastle have just about been the better team but only West Ham's Antonio's shot on the counter attack has forced either keeper into a save. </p>

<p>Stick with this though folks, I do see goals in it!</p>

<p>And granted this look like a 0-0 you want to be nowhere near, but I can assure you will see much worse goalless first halves than this throughout the season.</p>

<p>Some more clinical finishing would have seen the deadlock broken in another game and while we have not really had a clear cut chance, the game has ticked along nicely.</p>

<p>45+1min: We are into one added minute at the London Stadium.</p>

<p>43min: Slightly surprised we have not seen a goal in this first half based on its action. David Moyes looks pleased enough by his side's showing so far though as from the touchline he gives them an encouraging clap.</p>

<p>40min: The chances are coming but the finishing is just not up to it right now. Wilson cuts onto his right foot on the edge of the West Ham box but his neat curling effort across goal just evades the top corner.</p>

<p>39min: West Ham have looked a lot better in the last five minutes. Declan Rice plays in Fredericks on the right back and his cut-back for Jarrod Bowen results in the forward lashing just over.</p>

<p>34min: Now West Ham are back on the attack as Pablo Fornals' rising effort inside the box deflects off a Newcastle arm and onto the crossbar and behind.</p>

<p>VAR looks for a potential spot-kick but it is not given.</p>

<p>33min: And so nearly a brilliant goal from Carroll! He brings down the ball with one touch, lifts the ball over with Ogbonna with his next and then nearly drills a volley home on his weaker right foot (below), only for Ogbonna to recover and divert the ball just over the bar.</p>

<p>31min: Ignore the score, this has been a good first half so far. Newcastle break on the Hammers but after Wilson lays off the ball to an overlapping Jonjo Shelvey he fires just off target.</p>

<p>28min: Better from West Ham in an attacking sense. Michail Antonio is presented with a chance to shoot inside the box but his low effort is well saved by Karl Darlow.</p>

<p>Moments later another ball into the box from Ryan Fredericks results in Tomas Soucek nodding over.</p>

<p>25min: Really not convinced by West Ham's defending in this first half. It's another cross into their box that a Toon player is first to.</p>

<p>Shelvey's corner finds Andy Carroll inside the area but his looping header is off target.</p>

<p>9 - Newcastle United have won nine Premier League away games against West Ham United – only versus Tottenham Hotspur (10) have they picked up more wins on the road in the competition. Hope. pic.twitter.com/Rx3H6xGCKz</p>

<p>21min: We have seen this combination a couple of times now, with Lewis picking out Wilson at the near post. This time the Newcastle striker loses the attention of Ogbonna but can only divert his first time strike wide.</p>

<p>19min: And here's another. Allan Saint-Maximin's fancy footwork is not welcome around these parts, and Ryan Fredericks ensures that while the tricky winger can get the ball past him, the Toon star won't follow as he is hacked down on the touchline.</p>

<p>17min: Quite a hard hitting game so far, not much in the way of chances but there have been a few crunching challenges.</p>

<p>14min: From the free-kick the ball is pumped into the box, but Angelo Ogbonna's header can only loop on top of the crossbar and out for a goal kick.</p>

<p>13min: There is though a first yellow card for Isaac Hayden after he brings a charging down Michail Antonio 35 yards out.</p>

<p>10min: West Ham are yet to get going but that might be because Andy Carroll is playing like a one-man wrecking ball. Ryan Fredericks is now the victim of his flailing arms in the air (below) but still no yellow card for the striker.</p>

<p>7min: The crosses are still causing West Ham problems as Jonjo Shelvey's corner finds Federico Fernandez, whose near post header is well punched away by Lukasz Fabianski.</p>

<p>4min: Otherwise it's been a good start from Newcastle as Jamal Lewis's near post cross is headed wide by Callum Wilson.</p>

<p>1min: Ten seconds into the game, and Andy Carroll leads with his elbow on Tomas Soucek battling for a header. It's checked for a possible red card but it (just about) evades being a clear and obvious offence.</p>

<p>Here are the formations and starting line-ups: </p>

<p>West Ham: Fabianski, Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Soucek, Rice, Bowen, Noble, Fornals, Antonio.Subs: Balbuena, Yarmolenko, Felipe Anderson, Lanzini, Haller, Johnson, Randolph.</p>

<p>Newcastle: Darlow, Manquillo, Fernandez, Lascelles, Lewis, Shelvey, Hayden, Hendrick, Wilson, Carroll, Saint-Maximin.Subs: Joelinton, Ritchie, Krafth, Fraser, Almiron, Gillespie, Sean Longstaff.</p>

<p>Referee: Stuart Attwell (Warwickshire)</p>
