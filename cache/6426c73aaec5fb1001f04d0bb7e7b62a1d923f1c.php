<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pensioner has been reunited with her wedding ring almost 40 years to the day she lost it while playing catch with her son in their garden.</p>

<p>Paula Walter couldn't have wished for a better ruby anniversary present when the 18-karat gold band was unearthed by gardeners who were laying turf at her home in Plymouth.</p>

<p>The 65-year-old and her entire family had searched repeatedly for the ring over four decades, but with no luck. </p>

<p>Joe Walter and Paula on their wedding day at St Peter's Church in Crownhill, Plymouth on 28 August 1980</p>

<p>Desperate to find it, they hired a metal detector for two days but even that glimmer of hope was dashed.</p>

<p>So when gardener John discovered the gold band and returned it to Mrs Walter, she was more than shocked. </p>

<p>'Not only did they do an amazing job on the garden, they're also treasure hunters,' she said.  </p>

<p>Mrs Walter married husband Joe at St Peter's Church in Crownhill, Plymouth on 28 August 1980. </p>

<p>This 18 karat gold band flew off Mrs Walter's finger while she played catch with her son in the garden</p>

<p>She only wore the wedding band for a short period before it was lost.  </p>

<p>The pensioner vividly recalls the day she lost it while playing catch with her son in the garden.</p>

<p>At some point the precious band flew off her finger and onto the grass.</p>

<p>Unwavering faith. Mrs Walter was convinced she would one day be reunited with the ring she lost 40 years ago </p>

<p>A comb of the area proved fruitless and over the years both her and her family would sporadically go in the garden to hunt for it.</p>

<p>The ring even became a running family joke. Anyone stepping into the garden would be reminded by Mrs Walter to be on the look-out.</p>

<p>It wasn't until local company Man for All Seasons was hired to clear her garden that the mystery was eventually solved.</p>

<p>Mrs Walter's unwavering faith led her to cheekily ask the workmen to be on the look out for her ring. </p>

<p>Paula Walter said the workmen were not only gardeners but treasure hunters too after they discovered her ring</p>

<p>The gardeners weren't hopeful but much to their surprise the ring turned up at the exact spot it was lost all those years ago.  </p>

<p>Mrs Walter said: 'It really made my day, my 40 years really.' </p>
