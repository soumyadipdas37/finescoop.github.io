<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona have made an £18million bid for Ajax full back Sergino Dest which could end Max Aarons' hopes of a dream move to the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>The LaLiga side looked to be losing the race for Dest to Bayern Munich but have made a fresh approach, after their attempts to sign Aarons on loan were rejected by Norwich last week.</p>

<p>The Canaries are holding out for a £20m bid for their star right back and were not prepared to entertain Barca's offer of a loan without an obligation to buy   </p>

<p>Barcelona have made an £18million bid for 19-year-old Ajax full back Serginho Dest </p>

<p>If the offer for Dest is accepted it would end Max Aarons' hopes of a dream move to the club</p>

<p>Spanish outlet SPORT claimed the Catalans were preparing to make a fresh offer for Aarons after agreeing a five-year contract with the defender but Ronaldo Koeman has turned his attentions back to Dest. </p>

<p>The American international is also wanted by Bayern after impressing in the Eredivisie last season.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old made five assists in 20 appearances and looks to have a bright future.</p>

<p>The LaLiga side face competition for Dest from Bayern Munich and could still move for Aarons</p>

<p>Aarons is still a player Koeman likes after watching him in action against Everton last season.  </p>

<p>The 20-year-old played in all 36 Premier League games for Norwich last season and covered more distance than Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>

<p>His passing accuracy in the final third was one of the highest among the league's full backs despite his side finishing the season bottom of the table.</p>

<p>The defender has played in both of Norwich's Championship fixtures this season which have included a draw against Preston and a victory over Huddersfield.</p>

<p>Aarons has also been linked with Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen but it is understood his preference is to complete a move to the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Norwich are holding out for a £20million bid after rejecting a loan offer from the Catalans</p>
