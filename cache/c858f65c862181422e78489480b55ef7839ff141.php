<p>A first-of-its-kind holiday caravan that's been designed to look just like Her Majesty's Buckingham Palace residence inside has been unveiled – and it only costs £13.25 per person per night.</p>

<p>It's called The Royal Caravan and features chandeliers in every room, two gold-plated toilets, custom gold and red-velvet thrones 'to command from', a master-bedroom four-poster bed with crown decoration – and for guests with corgis, a dog-friendly royal dog bed and gold-plated dog bowls.</p>

<p>One may live like royalty: Guests at The Royal Caravan can command from custom gold and red-velvet thrones</p>

<p>The caravan is operated by Parkdean Resorts, which spent £100,000 on the Buckingham Palace-style makeover</p>

<p>The caravan, which is located in Cayton Bay, Scarborough, used to look a little more ordinary, of course, but Parkdean Resorts, which rents it out, gave it a £100,000 makeover to make it fit for royalty.</p>

<p>It's a static home that has 'sparkle like Markle', the company claims.</p>

<p>Guests-in-waiting can get a sneak peek of the splendour thanks to an MTV Cribs-style video that Parkdean Resorts produced, in which 'Queen Liz' shows viewers around.</p>

<p>HMRC: Her Majesty's Royal Caravan is the first of its kind, says Parkdean Resorts</p>

<p>Guests-in-waiting can get a sneak peek of the splendour thanks to an MTV Cribs-style video that Parkdean Resorts produced, in which 'Queen Liz' shows viewers around</p>

<p>She opens the fridge, as is tradition on MTV Cribs, and sits on the bed in the royal bedroom. 'This is not where the magic happens', she stresses.</p>

<p>During the tour, we see 'Kate and Wills' sorting out the dishes in the filigree-laced kitchen ('a haven that will turn any task into a fairytale') and relaxing on the terrace with cups of tea and Champagne, and get a peek inside 'William and Harry's room'.</p>

<p>We're also shown 'one's gold-plated lavatory'.</p>
