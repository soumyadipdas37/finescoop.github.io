<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Delta Goodrem is likely to not return to The Voice's new line-up of coaches after the reality show moved networks.</p>

<p>Channel Seven announced they have secured the rights to the singing competition over rivals at the Nine Network last month.</p>

<p>And it seems that Seven is unlikely to offer the Born To Try hitmaker a spinning chair due to a 'salary conflict,' The Daily Telegraph reported on Saturday. </p>

<p>Is this it for Team Delta? Delta Goodrem (pictured) is unlikely to return as a coach on The Voice Australia over 'salary conflict' with Channel Seven </p>

<p>Delta, who is rumoured to earn between $1million to $2million a year, is out of the network's price range, according to the publication.</p>

<p>But it seems Seven are in talks with other established local artists to join the show, as to re-sign her fellow judge Guy Sebastian.  </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Seven for comment.</p>

<p>Despite being the longest-serving coach on The Voice Australia, some viewers have called for Delta to be axed from the show.</p>

<p>Fans flocked to Facebook begging for Seven not to cast her, including one who wrote: 'Please no more Delta!'</p>

<p>'If they get rid of Delta I might actually watch this. Can't stand her,' one viewer wrote.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, The Daily Telegraph also reported that Channel Seven is 'set to axe coaches Boy George and Kelly Rowland' as part of a cost-cutting measure.</p>

<p>The publication understands the network feels Nine 'spent too much on B-listers' and is keen to spend their money on big-name replacements.</p>

<p>'One of the big changes Seven plans to make is how much is being spent on judges,' a source close to The Voice reportedly said.</p>

<p>It is claimed Seven is 'in talks' with American R&amp;B star Usher, while other replacements include Kylie Minogue and homegrown talent, Jessica Mauboy. </p>

<p>Big Brother host Sonia Kruger, 55, who previously presented the singing competition and is now over at Seven, is set to host the series in 2021. </p>
