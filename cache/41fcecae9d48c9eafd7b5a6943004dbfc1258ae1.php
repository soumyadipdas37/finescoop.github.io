<p> Ivana and her companion both wore disposable face masks for the walk back to the US President's ex-wife's abode</p>

<p>Earlier this month Ivana was blasted on social media following an appearance on the ITV show Loose Women, with some viewers branding her a 'bigot'. </p>

<p>During the lunchtime programme, Ivana claimed US immigrants must enter the country legally and was adamant that they pay taxes as she said the rest of Americans do.</p>

<p>She also generalized to the hosts that undocumented immigrants may rape women or not dress 'Americanly'.</p>

<p>Ivana - who is herself a legal immigrant to the US - said she is 'very proud' of her former partner.</p>

<p>'I see he can do a great job, he is pro everything which I believe in. He is Republican and so am I. He has achieved so much - especially with immigration,' she said in the interview. </p>

<p>Earlier this month Ivana, pictured yesterday, was blasted on social media following an appearance on the ITV show Loose Women, with some viewers branding her a 'bigot'</p>

<p>Ivana, pictured arriving home yesterday, was criticized earlier this month on social media for claiming undocumented immigrants may rape women or not dress 'Americanly'</p>

<p>'I am an immigrant, and I have no problem with the immigrants, but they must come into the country legally and get a job and pay taxes like the rest of the Americans and just live and be part of society.</p>

<p>'There are some people who don't even dress Americanly, they dress whatever they dress in and they don't get a job and they steal and they rape the women and that is not the idea.'</p>

<p>When asked whether she felt her view on immigration could be perceived as inhumane, she went on: 'It is inhumane, but everybody has to pick themselves up.</p>

<p>'They have to properly, apply for the visa so they can come to America and cross the border properly and get a job, have a house, start a family.'</p>

<p>Host Jane Moore interjected: 'But those opportunities are very few and far between nowadays aren't they?'</p>

<p>'They are, but the people who will prevail, the people who want to work will prevail, the people who want to get food stamps and sleep on the benches, this is what we don't want,' Ivana insisted.</p>

<p>Her comments left viewers outraged, with one calling the outburst 'disturbing', while another called the mother-of-three an 'embarrassing bigot'. </p>

<p>Ivana grew up in Czechoslovakia and moved to Canada in September 1973. She met Trump at a modeling event in New York City in 1976, and they married in April 1977.</p>

<p>The couple's first son, Donald Trump Jr, was born later that year in December. They welcomed their daughter Ivanka in 1981 and then their son Eric in 1984.</p>

<p>All three of the children were born in New York, making them US citizens; Ivana was legally living in the country at the time, but she didn't become a US citizen until 1988, although she was eligible for naturalization and citizenship three years after tying the knot with Trump. They divorced in 1990. </p>

<p>Donald Trump's first wife was born Ivana Zelníčková in Zlín, Czechoslovakia. </p>

<p>She took up skiing at the age of four, and encouraged by her father, she progressed to join the junior national ski team and through the sport, she had the opportunity to travel beyond the Soviet-era communist boundaries of what was then the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.</p>

<p>She moved to Prague for a masters degree in physical education, and while studying she married her friend Alfred Winklmayr in 1971, despite dating another man, Jiři Syrovatka, since 1967.</p>

<p>The marriage was purely to facilitate getting an Austrian passport so that she could leave Communist Czechoslovakia without defection. </p>

<p>It meant she could retain the right to return to visit her parents, and her passport came through in 1972 - the same year as she completed her masters. </p>

<p>The following year, she obtained an absentee divorce from Alfred Winklmayr in Los Angeles, where he had moved to teach skiing. </p>

<p>She then started a relationship with the lyricist and playwright Jiři Staidl who was killed in a car accident in 1973.</p>

<p>After his death, Ivana moved to Canada to live with Jiři Syrovatka, who had defected and owned a ski boutique in Montreal.</p>

<p>She lived in Montreal for two years where she continued to improve her English by taking night courses at McGill University and also worked as a model and a ski instructor. </p>

<p>In 1976, she met Donald Trump in New York on a modelling trip, after being sent to the city to help promote the 1976 Summer Olympics, which were held in Montreal. </p>

<p>The married and had three children, and she became a naturalized US citizen in 1988. </p>
