<p>Type 2 diabetics have a pancreas which is an irregular shape and up to a third smaller than a healthy one.</p>

<p>But last night British researchers revealed that the organ can be restored to a normal size if diabetes patients go into remission by losing around two stone.</p>

<p>Nearly four million people in the UK have type 2 diabetes, which is strongly linked to obesity. </p>

<p>The illness develops when the pancreas does not make enough insulin, the hormone which regulates blood sugar, or the insulin does not work properly.</p>

<p>Until today, it was not clear if a shrunken pancreas was among the causes of type 2 diabetes, or was a result of having the condition.</p>

<p>But the trial has shown conclusively that a shrunken pancreas is linked to excess fat, and can return to normal if diabetics lose around two stone (ten to 15kg).</p>

<p>As well as producing hormones to regulate blood sugar, a healthy pancreas produces enzymes to break down food.</p>

<p>Taking a hot bath at least four times a week may cut your risk of diabetes.</p>

<p>Researchers found that those who do are slimmer, have lower blood pressure and lower blood sugar levels.</p>

<p>They concluded: 'Our results indicate that daily heat exposure through hot-tub bathing has beneficial influences on cardiovascular risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes.'</p>

<p>The research, led by Kohnodai Hospital in Japan, was based on a study of 1,300 patients. </p>

<p>They were divided into four groups based on how many baths they took a week. </p>

<p>Those who bathed at least four times a week had slimmer waists, a lower body mass index and lower blood glucose levels than those who did not take at least one bath a week.</p>

<p>Lucy Chambers of Diabetes UK said the study raised more questions than answers, adding: 'It could be that people who bathe more frequently have a healthier lifestyle – perhaps they are more physically active – we just don't know from the limited data. </p>

<p>'That shouldn't stop you from running a bath and enjoying some relaxing 'me' time.' </p>

<p>Experts said the new findings add to mounting evidence that those with type 2 diabetes should be urged to follow radical low-calorie diets. </p>

<p>Professor Roy Taylor of Newcastle University, who led the study, said the findings will be 'enormously encouraging' for patients.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the NHS announced that thousands of type 2 diabetics will be offered a three-month 850 calorie soup and shake daily diet to beat the disease.</p>

<p>It followed the success of the DiRECT trial, a project led by Newcastle and Glasgow Universities involving almost 300 individuals with type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>In 2018 the study found that half of patients put on a strict soups-and-shakes diet of no more than 850 calories a day, aiming to lose 15kg, went into remission from diabetes.</p>

<p>The same team has now found that the pancreas size of those who had been in remission for two years increased by 20 per cent – almost to normal size. There was also a decrease in the amount of fat in the pancreas, and the irregular shape of the organ returned to normal.</p>

<p>Experts said that weight loss reduces the amount of fat in the pancreas. </p>

<p>This restores the whole organ and helps the recovery of beta cells – which produce insulin. </p>

<p>Dr Elizabeth Robertson of Diabetes UK, said: 'Our DiRECT trial has revolutionised thinking about type 2 diabetes – we no longer consider it a life-long condition for everyone, and know remission is possible for some.'</p>

<p>The findings were presented at the European Association for the Study of Diabetes Conference, and are due to be published in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology.</p>

<p>Type 1 diabetes is an unpreventable autoimmune disease, but type 2 is mostly caused by poor diet. Britain's obesity epidemic has led to soaring levels of type 2. </p>

<p>Professor Taylor added: 'The solution to the problem of type 2 diabetes lies in the hands of politicians. Legislation on supply of high calorie foods is essential.'</p>
