<p>Referencing her split from ex-husband Liam Hemsworth in August last year, Miley began: 'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that.</p>

<p>Miley added: 'We are just deciding who we wanna be in our lives, what we wanna do, and so don't make it some drama story if next week we're hanging out, getting pizza.</p>

<p>'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not.'</p>

<p>On his own: 'We've been friends for 10 years and we're going to continue to be friends, so just don't make it something that it is not,' Miley said of Cody; seen here this week on Instagram</p>
