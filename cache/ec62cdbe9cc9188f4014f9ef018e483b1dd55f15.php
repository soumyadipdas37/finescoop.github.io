<p>Speaking to Page Six, Mr Halperin said: 'There is no doubt that Epstein provided girls to Andrew, and that was the reason they were friends. He had an obsession with redheads, and Epstein would have his scouts combing the streets for the most beautiful redheads before they met.</p>

<p>He added: 'One of Andrew’s ex-lovers said he had a sex addiction because he was always second to Prince Charles. He compared his relationship with his brother, to William and Harry. William is looked at as royal material, just like Charles, whereas he and Harry were the bad boys.</p>

<p>Ian Halperin, author of Sex Lies and Dirty Money by the World's Powerful Elite, said 'there is no doubt that Epstein provided girls to Andrew'</p>

<p>'About the Epstein case, about Maxwell, especially about Prince Andrew and about a plethora of other people connected to Epstein whose roles have never been revealed before.'</p>
