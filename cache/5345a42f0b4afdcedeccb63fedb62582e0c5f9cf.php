<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Victorian politician exploded with rage on live TV as he slammed Daniel Andrews over his new rules on masks.</p>

<p>Liberal MP Tim Smith said 'we're being muzzled like dogs' after the premier announced $200 fines for anyone not wearing a fitted face mask in public.</p>

<p>The strict rule means bandanas, scarfs and face shields are no longer acceptable.</p>

<p>Mr Smith wore a mask with the word 'Dandemic' inscribed during the Sky News interview</p>

<p>Mr Smith, shadow housing minister, told Sky News the rule is unfair on people whose glasses fog up if they wear a fitted mask and said face shields should still be allowed.</p>

<p>Wearing a mask with the word 'Dandemic' inscribed, he said: 'For many people - when they try to go walking as part of their two hours' exercise - their glasses fog up and they can't see where they are going.</p>

<p>'I mean my poor old dad needs to wear one of these shields when he's walking because his glasses fog up and he can't see where he is going.'</p>

<p>'We're being muzzled like dogs because of the Labor Party's incompetence. </p>

<p>Holding up a face shield, he added: 'I'm happy to wear a mask in the supermarket or on public transport - that makes perfect sense - but why can't we wear these while we're walking outside? It's stupid.'</p>

<p>After Mr Smith's furious outburst, Labor councillor Nicholas Reece told him the reason behind the rule was that health experts believe fitted masks are safer. </p>

<p>Premier Andrews said on Sunday: 'With more people moving across our city, our public health team have advised the rules around wearing a mask need to be strengthened.' </p>

<p>Mr Smith also said Victoria's 9pm curfew, which was lifted on Monday morning, should have been removed months ago because it was 'disproportionate'.</p>

<p>Victoria suffered on five news cases of coronavirus on Monday after Mr Andrews announced a faster road map for relaxing restrictions which potentially ends lockdown in Melbourne on 19 October instead of 26 October.</p>

<p>The latest deaths take the state toll to 787 and the national figure to 875.</p>

<p>But there were only 6,807 new tests and authorities want to start testing more residents in high risk industries such as aged care and meatworks. </p>

<p>The premier has said repeatedly that tests must stay high for officials to be confident in easing restrictions.</p>

<p>Jeroen Weimar from the Department of Health and Human Services said he was concerned about testing levels across outer regional Victoria.</p>

<p>He said also waste water testing had been expanded and there were now 23 sampling sites across the state.</p>

<p>Mr Weimar said the department had trialled saliva testing with 1,000 Victoria Police officers and picked up one positive case in the Dandenong station.</p>

<p>Mr Weimar said more than 16,000 people in the Dandenong area had been tested in the past two to three weeks, with a 50 per cent increase in one week.</p>

<p>The outbreak has reached 44 cases across eight households.</p>

<p>'It hasn't spread beyond those households,' he said.</p>

<p>Melbourne's all-important rolling new case average is now down to 20.3 and is at 0.6 for regional areas.</p>

<p>There were just 31 cases with an unknown source in Melbourne on September 12-25 and none outside the city.      </p>
