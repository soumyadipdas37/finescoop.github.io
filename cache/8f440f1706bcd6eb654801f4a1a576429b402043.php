<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An upgraded version of the Switch game console — with improved power and graphics — could be released by Nintendo early next year, a report has suggested.</p>

<p>Rumours of the hardware upgrade to the Japanese firm's popular hybrid console have originated from supply chain sources, Taiwan's Economic Daily News reported. </p>

<p>Nintendo did release two new models of the Switch last year — one featuring a new chipset that reduced battery drain and a handheld-only version, the Switch Lite. </p>

<p>An upgraded version of the Switch game console, pictured — with improved power and graphics — could be released by Nintendo early next year, a report has suggested</p>

<p>The release of the hardware upgrade would be accompanied by a series of new game releases, both from Nintendo and its partners, Bloomberg News reported. </p>

<p>These are suggested will include games targeted at both the casual and 'hardcore' gamer demographics.</p>

<p>A number of major titles previously announced for the Switch have yet to be released — including 'Metroid Prime 4' and an untitled 'The Legend of Zelda' sequel — which could potentially be being timed for release with the new console version.</p>

<p>In fact, the relative sparsity of Switch releases this year could be explained by keeping titles in reserve until the hardware update is ready, argues the Verge.</p>

<p>The hardware update will reportedly include additional computing power and 4K high-definition graphics, unnamed sources told Bloomberg News.</p>

<p>It would be the first major overhaul to the console's specs since it was first put on the commercial market back in early 2017. </p>

<p>Much of the Switch's success has been attributed to the popular life simulation game 'Animal Crossing: New Horizons', pictured, which was released in late March, around the time that countries began implementing lockdowns to combat the spread of COVID-19</p>

<p>Sales of the Switch have continued apace in 2020 — with more than 61 million of the hybrid consoles having been sold up to the end of July alone.</p>

<p>This places the Switch on a par with the Nintendo Entertainment System  — or NES, for short — the 8-bit console which is credited with reviving the flagging home video game market in the mid-eighties.</p>

<p>Nintendo has had a rough few years.</p>

<p>Following disastrous sales of its Wii U console, investors clamoured for the Kyoto-based firm to close down its home console division and focus on smartphone games.</p>

<p>Super Mario Run, the first time one of Nintendo’s iconic video game characters appeared on a device that wasn’t built by the company itself, set download records across the globe when it launched in December 2016.</p>

<p>Super Mario Run topped 40 million downloads just four days - becoming the fastest game to reach the milestone in App Store history, Nintendo revealed at the time.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo shares tumbled after it was revealed only a tiny percentage of players were willing to pay the £9.99 charge to unlock all of the content in the game.</p>

<p>‘Mario is arguably the most popular gaming franchise in the world, yet we see only about 8 percent of those who try the game actually purchasing it,’ Sensor Tower analyst Spencer Gabriel said.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo does not appear to be deterred, with a slate of new mobile games scheduled to launch between now and March 2019.</p>

<p>According to The Wall Street Journal, Nintendo is quietly working on a Legend Of Zelda adventure for smartphones and tablets to launch in late 2018, and Nintendo recently confirmed its best-selling racing game – Mario Kart -- would be headed to iOS and Android smartphones before early 2019.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the Kyoto gaming company has seen enormous success with the successor to the Wii U, Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>The home console, which can be on a television or on-to-go thanks to its in-built six-inch touchscreen and detachable Joy Con controllers, has seen enormous demand.</p>

<p>At its most recent earnings call, Nintendo almost doubled its full-year operating profit forecast.</p>

<p>Sales of the all-new console, which includes its own version of Mario Kart and Legend Of Zelda, have exceeded the company's estimates and outstripped those of its predecessor, the Wii U.</p>

<p>Nintendo also raised its year-end Switch sales forecast to 14 million consoles from 10 million.</p>

<p>This new annual target would alone exceed lifetime sales of 13.56 million consoles for the Wii U, which was on the market for about five years. </p>
