<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Gold Coast Titans star Bryce Cartwright has received sickening threats since he and his wife unwittingly became the faces of the anti-vaxxer movement. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old, who was released by the Titans on Thursday, and wife Shanelle sparked controversy last year when they publicly declared they would not vaccinate their two children, Koa and Naia.</p>

<p>Cartwright made more headlines in May when he refused a mandatory influenza vaccination under the NRL's return-to-play regulations.</p>

<p>He said the threats he'd received since both incidents were 'nasty' and not worth repeating. </p>

<p>'I don't want to go too much into it but yeah, it involved my children,' he told Nine News. </p>

<p>Former Gold Coast Titans player Bryce Cartwright (pictured with wife Shanelle) has received horrific threats involving his children after he and his wife unwittingly became the faces of the anti-vaxxer movement  </p>

<p>Cartwright was left 'broken' after being released from the final year of his lucrative contract, reportedly worth $450,000. </p>

<p>He said he still had a desire to play rugby league and had been working with sprint trainer Roger Fabri to help turn his career around.</p>

<p>'I've played since I could remember, grew up with a football in my hands, slept with one, it's all I think about (and) I still watch every game,' he said. </p>

<p>Cartwright said he uses a range of methods to help clear his mind, including speaking to a counsellor.</p>

<p>'I have little things like meditation ... to clear my head and it can be as simple as just going for a swim, staying off my phone and taking the kids the beach,' he said.</p>

<p>The Titans reportedly held private concerns over Cartwright's welfare before releasing him.</p>

<p>Captain Kevin Proctor said he was worried about his former teammate. </p>

<p>'I know he's had some family dramas and he's gone to Sydney to sort some stuff out,' he told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Cartwright and his wife Shanelle (pictured together with son Koa) sparked controversy in 2019 when they announced they would not vaccinate their two children, Koa and Naia</p>

<p>The former Titans player made more headlines in May when he was granted permission to play despite refusing a mandatory influenza vaccination under the NRL's return-to-play regulations</p>

<p>'It's disappointing to lose him through this period but hopefully he is OK with his family.' </p>

<p>Just one week before he was sacked, the second-rower said he was struggling to stay motivated.</p>

<p>'The critics don't see what you go through. My knees swell up and I have to get it drained all the time. We get paid good money, but it's not an easy ride,' he said. </p>

<p>Touted as a future NSW State of Origin prospect following a strong start to his career at the Panthers, Cartwright made the move to the Titans to work under ex-coach Garth Brennan.</p>

<p>The pair had worked together at Penrith but Cartwright struggled with form and was criticised for poor defensive efforts.</p>

<p>When Brennan was sacked in the middle of 2019, Cartwright's future at the club was also unclear with many viewing him as a costly relic of the former coach's tenure. </p>

<p>It's unclear where Cartwright's future lies with the 25-year-old revealing earlier in the year he was battling a chronic knee issue.</p>

<p>Cartwright (pictured at Titans training) was released from the last year of a lucrative contract, reportedly worth $450,000, by the Gold Coast Titans on September 17</p>
