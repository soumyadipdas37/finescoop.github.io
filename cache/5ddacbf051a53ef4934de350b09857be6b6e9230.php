<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Sony World Photography Awards 2021 is open for business.</p>

<p>And the organisers have revealed some of the stunning early submissions.</p>

<p>The images presented here have all been entered into the open contest and include a powerful black-and-white shot of a lion, a foggy scene near Deer Park in Pembrokeshire, Wales, and a breathtaking picture of the Vestrahorn mountain in Iceland.</p>

<p>Scroll down to see some of the early entries - proof that best certainly isn't being saved until last.</p>

<p>British photographer Dan Gerard was driving to work one morning when he spotted a silhouette that caught his eye on top of a dead tree.
