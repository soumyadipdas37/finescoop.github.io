<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police have refused to apologise after a failed bid to prosecute a learner driver for overshooting a red light by a few feet.</p>

<p>Joseph Bell, who was 17 at the time of the incident, has been granted an absolute discharge after he was stopped at a junction in Nottingham in December last year.</p>

<p>The student was having a lesson with his driving instructor, who was able to take charge if needed, and paused in the zone for 14.8 seconds.</p>

<p>Footage showed there was no oncoming traffic or pedestrians, with the magistrates' court hearing Mr Bell pulled up to the intersection at a slow speed. </p>

<p>Mr Bell, who is now 18, admitted to failing to comply with the traffic light signal but will not be charged a fee or have any points added to his driving licence. </p>

<p>Despite the ruling, Nottinghamshire Police still backed their decision to defend the case.</p>

<p>The learner driver's car, pictured left, captured on camera at the junction during a driving lesson. Footage showed there was no oncoming traffic or pedestrians</p>

<p>Inspector Simon Allen told the BBC: 'The safety of all road users is paramount, which is why the law holds learner drivers equally accountable and they must ensure that they follow the rules of the road.</p>

<p>'In these cases, drivers have the choice to take a ticket or to go to court as happened here.' </p>

<p>Mr Bell expressed his relief over not having any points added to his licence and his mother, Gaynor, said she was frustrated with the force's move. </p>

<p>Bruce Stuart, defending Mr Bell, said: 'This is something that learner drivers do - they make mistakes.' </p>
