<p>The Love Island star, 31, appeared make-up free and 'purposefully put no filter on' as she took to the social media site on Wednesday after causing backlash with her previous snap. </p>

<p>Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George, said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.</p>

<p>Hitting back: Laura Anderson has defiantly hit back at trolls after sparking controversy with her 'changing face' after uploading a photo on Instagram on Tuesday</p>

<p>'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse.</p>

<p>'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. </p>

<p>'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'    </p>

<p>'I didn't even recognise her!' Love Island fans claimed Laura looked 'unrecognisable' as she reunited with her co-stars for socially-distanced filming  on Tuesday (R in 2018)</p>

<p>Defiant: Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George, said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this'</p>

<p> Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.</p>

<p>One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! </p>

<p>'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!</p>

<p>'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)</p>

<p>'I got so much abuse': 'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse'</p>

<p>Stunned: Under the image shared to Jack's Instagram, social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance </p>

<p>Another referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   </p>

<p>The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018. </p>

<p>TV star previously told The Sun: 'I went for a place that I know does a natural look. I know there's a lot of young people that follow me and I don't want to promote anything like that as it's a dangerous topic really.</p>

<p>Peace: Meanwhile, former pen salesman Jack, 26, also opted for a two-piece, as he rocked a vertically striped polo shirt and blue shorts</p>

<p>'People have to feel good [inside] before they do all that I believe that but for me it's something I wanted to do for a really long time and I came out and just did it as I was thinking about it while I was in there.</p>

<p>'It's a touchy subject and I get that and I would never want to promote that to young girls, but I still want to live my life for me. It's hard, but I'm nearly 30.'  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a number of former Love Island stars have reportedly been left outraged, after allegedly being snubbed from appearing in an upcoming reunion special.</p>

<p>'She looks absolutely stunning!' Others decided to focus on how 'beautiful' the blonde looked on set</p>

<p>The three-part special, said to be called Love Island: Where Are They Now?, was originally planned to be restricted to the top four contestants from each series, but exceptions have reportedly been made − sparking alleged feuds.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Those involved are very excited, but it has put a few noses out of joint among stars who haven’t been asked, especially those who think they are bigger names than those who have.  </p>

<p>'Unfortunately things have got a bit nasty between some. At first it was just going to be the finalists from each series, but once exceptions started being made it really sparked anger and resentment.'</p>

<p>'I think I look fine': 'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love'</p>

<p>Among the former contestants expected to take part in the special are 2018 breakout stars and exes Megan Barton Hanson and Wes Nelson, and last year's runner-ups Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Montana Brown, who narrowly missed out on the finale in 2017 after she was dumped from the Mallorca villa with her then-beau Alex Beattie, is said to be included in the line-up of returning stars.</p>

<p> MailOnline has contacted a representative for Love Island for comment.</p>
