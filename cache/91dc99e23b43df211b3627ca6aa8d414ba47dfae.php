<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stood firm on his calls for China to be investigated over the origins of COVID-19, while also urging all nations to share a vaccine once it is found.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison took to a virtual stage on Saturday morning to address the 75th United Nations general assembly, praising the World Health Organisation for establishing an inquiry into the global response to coronavirus.</p>

<p>'There is also a clear mandate to identify the zoonotic source of the COVID-19 virus and how it was transmitted to humans,' he said in the pre-recorded speech.</p>

<p>'This virus has inflicted a calamity on our world and its peoples. We must do all we can to understand what happened for no other purpose than to prevent it from happening again.'</p>

<p>Scott Morrison said whoever finds the vaccine first should share it with the rest of the world (Pictured: University of Oxford COVID-19 vaccine trial) </p>

<p>The inquiry resolution backed by 145 countries in May does not mention China, instead committing to an impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation of the pandemic.</p>

<p>China eventually supported the European Union motion.</p>

<p>When Mr Morrison pushed for the inquiry into COVID-19, China's deputy ambassador compared Australia's support with the murder of Julius Ceasar. </p>

<p>'Approximately identical to Julius Caesar in his final day when he saw Brutus approaching him. ''Et tu, Brute?'',' ambassador Wang Xining said, news.com.au reported.</p>

<p>'More importantly, it hurts the feelings of the Chinese people.' </p>

<p>There are also claims that the origin of COVID-19 had evolved naturally due to contact with animals and humans rather than escaping a lab.   </p>

<p>Ties between the two nations have since been fraught, with tariffs being imposed on some goods and Australian journalists being evacuated from China.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison urged other leaders to share a coronavirus vaccine if they discover one.</p>

<p>He has previously said if Australia found a vaccine, it would be shared across the world.</p>

<p>'This is a global responsibility and it's a moral responsibility for a vaccine to be shared far and wide,' Mr Morrison said.</p>

<p>'Some might see short term advantage or even profit.</p>

<p>'But I assure you to anyone who may think along those lines, humanity will have a very long memory and be a very, very severe judge.'</p>

<p>Mr Morrison's speech also focused on the dangers of disinformation, urging for more to be done to prevent it.</p>

<p>'Disinformation costs lives and creates a climate of fear and division,' he said.</p>

<p>'It goes against Australia's values and beliefs as a free, open society.'</p>

<p>The prime minister also touched on trade rules and the need to peacefully resolve disputes through dialogue.</p>

<p>'As an outward-looking, sovereign, trading nation, Australia also values the rules and institutions that enable international trade,' Mr Morrison said.</p>

<p>'We know that trade creates wealth and brings nations together. It makes us more prosperous, all of us.</p>

<p>'We won't retreat into the downward spiral of protectionism in Australia.'</p>

<p>Mr Morrison says Australia is leading efforts to reform the World Trade Organisation to create non-discriminatory trade rules as well as a digital guide.</p>

<p>'We need to make sure these standards serve all countries rather than any single power and that they are developed in line with the fundamental principles of the global order.'</p>

<p>On reform of the UN itself, Mr Morrison said Australia wanted to see multilateral institutions deliver 'for us and all nations'.</p>

<p>'We're committed to ensuring they are fit for purpose, that they're effective, that they're open and transparent and, most importantly, that they are accountable to the sovereign states that form them.'</p>
