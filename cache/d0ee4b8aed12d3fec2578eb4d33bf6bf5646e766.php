<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An erect penis will appear on television this evening for the first time in a new taboo-shattering Channel 4 documentary. </p>

<p>Me &amp; My Penis, which airs at 10pm, will show footage of eight erections as men pose for naked photographs while discussing male issues.</p>

<p>The controversial scene, featuring explicit close-up shots, will break perceived regulations which up until now have prevented erections from airing on TV. </p>

<p>An erect penis will appear on television this evening for the first time in new taboo-shattering Channel 4 documentary Me &amp; My Penis</p>

<p>'But as these aroused private parts are shown in an entirely artistic context, filming them doesn't break any rules.</p>

<p>'Channel 4 also clearly feel that in more open-minded times, there's likely to be fewer complaints from viewers — particularly as the show airs at 10pm which is well after the watershed.'</p>

<p>The subjects filmed for the documentary are photographed by London-based British artist and fine art photographer Ajamu, whose radical portraits of the male body have pushed boundaries and provoked cultural debate.</p>

<p>While he shoots their intimate photographs, the men discuss their varied experiences – from the pleasures of sex to stories of infertility and sexual abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder, homophobia and mental health. </p>

<p>The programme, which airs at 10pm, will show footage of eight erections as men pose for naked photographs while discussing male issues</p>

<p>During the shoot, Ajamu encourages his subjects to rethink the way they see their bodies and themselves, while questioning the taboo that still surrounds the penis.</p>

<p>Shaminder Nahal, commissioning editor at Channel 4, said: 'In this funny and moving film, the penis becomes a gateway through which to explore all sorts of aspects of masculinity. </p>

<p>'The men taking part deal with everything from sex to violence, fear and love, masturbation and ejaculation. </p>

<p>'While we get to see a range of penises and erections – we also see the men explore deep, often hidden, feelings in their photography sessions – and start a conversation about our bodies and ourselves.'</p>

<p>For years it has been perceived that broadcasters in the UK are required to abide by the unofficial 'Mull of Kintyre' guideline when it comes to showing penises.</p>

<p>It states that a phallus should never be shown in a more erect state than the outlines of the Scottish peninsula - however this is in fact an urban legend and the British Board of Film Classification has denied this is a legitimate test.</p>

<p>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has previously said there is no ban on showing erections on TV, but it would have to be 'justified by the context'.   </p>

<p>For years it has been perceived that broadcasters in the UK are required to abide by the unofficial 'Mull of Kintyre' guideline when it comes to showing penises. It states that a phallus should never be shown in a more erect state than the outlines of the Scottish peninsula (pictured) - however this is in fact an urban legend and the British Board of Film Classification has denied this is a legitimate test</p>

<p>In 2018, the BBFC carried out market research on the British public about a number of issues - including nudity - believing Brits have become more desensitised to nudity in films and TV.</p>

<p>He told Radio 4's Front Row: 'These days if you have an erection on screen, the issue is, is it a 15 level erection or an 18 level erection.</p>

<p>'We've been consulting with the public on this and in 2013, we liberalised slightly and we're now going back to the public as we speak and saying, "Have we got this right, have we done what you asked us to do in terms of how we classify erections?"'</p>
