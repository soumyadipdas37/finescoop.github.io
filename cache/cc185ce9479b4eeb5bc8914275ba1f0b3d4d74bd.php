<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A heavily pregnant woman who conned well-wishers out of $55,000 by pretending to be battling cancer has appealed against her two-year jail sentence, claiming it is far too severe.</p>

<p>Lucy Victoria Wieland, 28, scammed her kind victims, including her ex-boyfriend, Australian Defence Force soldier Bradley Congerton, posing as a cancer victim.</p>

<p>The eight-months-pregnant fraudster was sentenced to two years in prison on August 4 after pleading guilty to six fraud charges and one count of possessing a restricted drug. </p>

<p>Wieland last Friday appealed her sentence by submitting documents to to the Townsville District Court contesting the 'manifestly excessive' ruling.</p>

<p>Her barrister had told the court Wieland had a rare mental health illness, The Townsville Bulletin reported.</p>

<p>The defence barrister Michael Hibble told the court an assessment found his client was suffering from a rare factitious mental disorder known as Munchausen syndrome and the scam 'snowballed' out of control as community sympathy grew. </p>

<p>'She had no control of how generous the Townsville community would be in relation to the donations,' Mr Hibble told the court. </p>

<p>The convicted conwoman had told police she could not even remember deceiving her family and friends, who she told she had ovarian cancer in 2018. </p>

<p>So committed was Wieland to the scam that she went as far as shaving her head, posted photos of herself receiving treatment on social media and set up a Go FundMe page.</p>

<p>The court also heard Wieland forged a doctor's letter and lied about her illness on medical forms when she donated blood several times. </p>

<p> Weiland (pictured) has said her prison sentence is 'manifestly excessive' and formally appealed the ruling</p>

<p>In sentencing, Magistrate Viviana Keegan described Wieland's deception as 'beyond significant', the ABC reported.</p>

<p>'There's also an extraordinary breach of trust to members of the public, who were empathetic towards you … and gave up money to try and help you when it was all just a lie,' she told Wieland.</p>

<p>Wieland will give birth to her first child in October and will be eligible for parole in February next year. </p>
