<p>And Vogue Williams showed her physique has bounced back at incredible speed, when she unveiled a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini on Monday.</p>

<p>Bounced back: Vogue Williams showed her post-baby body has bounced back at incredible speed, when she unveiled a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini on Monday</p>

<p>Despite having given birth less than two months ago, her abs, legs and arms all showed strong gym-crafted definition as she stood before the camera.</p>

<p>The seven-minute long clip started with her husband Spencer training the camera on his face as she stood behind him.</p>

<p>He soon stepped aside, with the help of a gentle playful nudge from his wife, as she unveiled herself in all of her bikini-clad glory.</p>

<p>As the video progressed, the Irish beauty was seen using products from her sunless tanning line, Bare by Vogue, which she applied to all areas of her skin.</p>

<p>Her doting husband Spencer also got in on the action, putting on a glove so that he could help with applying the product to his glamorous wife's back.</p>

<p>Further getting in on the action, Spencer removed his top so that Vogue could also return the favour and apply some of the fake tan to him. </p>

<p>Captioning the video, the star wrote: 'This one is for all the new tanners and people who want to apply their tan better! <?php echo e('@'); ?>barebyvogue will give you a glow like you’re just back from holidays but application is key to looking bronzed.</p>

<p>'After some fake tan disasters in my life (a lot of them) I have finally mastered applying my tan... if you want any tips ask below and I’ll answer.'</p>

<p>Her video comes four days after she proudly showcasing her postpartum figure as she enjoyed a work out session in her west London garden on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two, who gave birth to her daughter Gigi in July, looked sensational in a black sports bra which she teamed with a pair of leggings.</p>

<p>Vogue showcased her fitness prowess as she practised a series of movements including lunges and squats using a purple resistance band.</p>

<p>The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades. </p>

<p>Vogue finished her sporty look with colourful running shoes, as she admitted she was struggling with some moves because she hadn't done them for so long. </p>

<p>Looking good! Last Thursday, Vogue proudly showcased her postpartum figure as she enjoyed a work out session in her west London garden</p>

<p>Working out: The mother-of-two, 34, who gave birth to her daughter Gigi in July, looked sensational in a black sports bra which she teamed with a pair of leggings</p>

<p>Hard at work: Vogue showcased her fitness prowess as she practiced a series of movements including lunges and squats using a purple resistance band</p>

<p>Vogue gave birth to Gigi Margaux on July 23 with husband Spencer, 33, and the couple welcomed their first child, son Theodore in September 2018. </p>

<p>Spencer confirmed last week that he and Vogue will be having more kids in the future, only if she allows him to hire a live-in nanny.</p>

<p>During the first episode of their eponymous podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star also stressed the 'necessity' of childcare for working parents. </p>

<p>Responding to fans' queries about growing their family, presenter Vogue confirmed: 'Yes we will be. Not yet though', before the reality star added: 'Depending on the nanny's availability and whether or not she can move in permanently. I won't do it otherwise.' </p>

<p>Vogue shared the details of their agreement as she said: 'Spenny did actually say that, that we could have four kids if I swore that we could have a live-in nanny by the time we had four kids. </p>

<p>Fresh-faced: The Heart FM presenter wore her blonde locks swept back into a low bun, while going make-up free and covering her face with a pair of round shades</p>

<p>'It's different for Irish people I think because we don't do the whole night nanny thing, and all that stuff, you don't hear about that at home, but here, you have maternity nurses, night nannies and stuff like that and we just don't have that.' </p>

<p>Spencer left his long-term partner in giggles as he joked he'd wear 'condoms every time' if she tries to have a third baby without a live-in nanny, with the blonde sarcastically replying: 'Good luck, I'd be really into that, we can start doing that right now because I'd rather not go on the pill.'</p>

<p>When asked whether they currently receive help with their children, the former Lothario said: 'Yes, obviously.   </p>

<p>'And it's not even a pompous like, obviously, it's how can two adults who work, full time, look after kids as well. It's a necessity, of day to day life. If one of us didn't work, then we wouldn't have a nanny, given that we work.  </p>

<p>'Without being rude but I don't compare myself to other people. I have my mission in life and the things I want to achieve, and a nanny is very much a part of that.'</p>

<p>'But if you saw me complaining online, about being a mum and having a job… what would you think about me?', the mother-of-two asked, with the TV star replying: 'I'd say why don't you get the nanny to do more?' </p>
