<p>Eden Hazard was sold to Real Madrid by Chelsea last summer and the Blues are cashing in </p>

<p>This time around Real will pay Chelsea £50m and next year will see the coffers boosted even further to the tune of £57m. </p>

<p>The deal is all the more remarkable when Hazard was already pushing to leave the club and had just one year left on his contract at the time. </p>

<p>It was perhaps even sweeter when it appeared Chelsea had the better of the bargain with Hazard struggling in his first campaign with the LaLiga giants. </p>

<p>Hazard was plagued by form and fitness issues throughout the season for Real </p>

<p>Form and fitness issues plagued him and the Belgian even described the season as his worst ever. </p>

<p>Hazard scored just once in 22 outings for Real with hamstring, foot and ankle injuries a constant problem. </p>

<p>The financial outlay to bring him in is providing a boost in the market for Chelsea, who have broken the record for the biggest ever Premier League summer spend. </p>

<p>Kai Havertz will follow Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell through the door at Stamford Bridge, four players recruited at a combined fee of around £230m.   </p>

<p>This summer Real Madrid are paying Frank Lampard's side £50m and next year it will be £57m</p>
