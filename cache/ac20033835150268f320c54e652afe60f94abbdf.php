<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Twitter account for Herman Cain on Sunday claimed that COVID-19 was 'not as deadly' as media outlets have portrayed it to be - despite the fact he died from it just a month ago.   </p>

<p>Cain, a prominent Republican businessman and fervent Trump supporter, died from the coronavirus on July 30 after his office revealed he was hospitalized with the illness earlier that month. He was 74. </p>

<p>His death came after he attended the President's controversial June campaign rally held in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that did not require face masks or social distancing. </p>

<p>Cain's daughter, Dr. Melanie Cain Gallo, announced on August 11 that the family would continue to update his social media accounts under the new moniker, The Cain Gang.</p>

<p>Under The Cain Gang, Herman Cain's Twitter account claimed that COVID-19 is 'not as deadly' as media outlets said just one month after he died from the illness</p>

<p>'He would have wanted this platform to continue giving people reasons to feel that hope,' she wrote on HermanCain.com.</p>

<p>The account has since shared many conservative news articles with the majority of them coming from The Western Journal, which was the source of its latest gaffe this week.</p>

<p>In a now-deleted tweet, The Cain Gang shared a link to an article that claimed 94 per cent of COVID-19 deaths were linked to underlying conditions. </p>

<p>'It looks like the virus is not as deadly as the mainstream media first made it out to be,' the account wrote. </p>

<p>According to New York Times article last year, the publication was downgraded by Facebook after articles it published repeatedly popped up on fact-checking sites and Apples News blacklisted them for promoting stories with 'views overwhelmingly rejected by the scientific community.'</p>

<p>Google News avoided the site after they discovered what they deemed deceptive business practices.  </p>

<p>Understandably, several people on social media pointed out the hypocrisy of the tweet and were left stunned by the post. </p>

<p>'This is the sassiest, “Surprise! I’m a zombie now!” announcement ever,' wrote Actor Patton Oswalt early Monday morning. </p>

<p>Brandon Friedman, columnist and founder of Rakkasan Tea Company, wrote: 'Herman Cain being killed by a pandemic and then later tweeting that the pandemic isn't really that deadly isn't the most important thing to happen in 2020 but it is by far the craziest.' </p>

<p>Director and writer Dylan Park was shocked Cain's team had continued to 'downplay' the pandemic.  </p>

<p>Actor Patton Oswalt called the tweet the 'sassiest "Surprise! I'm a Zombie now!" announcement </p>

<p>A number of Twitter users pushed back at the tweet and pointed out that Cain had died from the virus just one month ago</p>

<p>Dylan Park: 'Herman Cain’s team is still downplaying COVID-19 even after Herman Cain died of COVID-19. Lmao you can’t make this s***up'</p>

<p>Cody Johnston summarized the confusion on social media by tweeting, ''Sir, the virus killed you. You died from it'</p>

<p>'Herman Cain’s team is still downplaying COVID-19 even after Herman Cain died of COVID-19. Lmao you can’t make this s***up,' he wrote. </p>

<p>Podcaster and journalist Cody Johnston summarized social media's feelings about the tweet by quipping: 'Sir, the virus killed you. You died from it.'   </p>

<p>On June 20th, Cain was an attendee at Trump's disastrous rally that ended with an unexpectedly small crowd, eight members of the advance team contracting the virus and campaign staff having to self-isolate afterward in case of infection. </p>

<p>He shared a photo of himself and other black conservatives sitting inside the arena venue. None of the people photographed wore face masks and were not the recommended six feet apart. </p>

<p>Rally attendees had to sign off on legal language promising not to sue the Trump campaign if they contracted COVID-19. </p>

<p>'Here’s just a few of the #BlackVoicesForTrump at tonight’s rally! Having a fantastic time!'' he wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>On July 1, the same day Cain was taken by ambulance to the hospital as his breathing worsened, he put out a tweet complimenting South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for not making social distancing and mask-wearing mandatory at Trump's July 3 appearance in her state </p>

<p>On the day Cain was hospitalized, he shared a tweet that praised South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for announcing Trump's Fourth of July event at Mount Rushmore would not be socially distanced.</p>

<p>'Masks will not be mandatory for the event, which will be attended by President Trump. PEOPLE ARE FED UP!' he wrote. </p>

<p>Cain was in the high-risk group for the virus because of his age. He's also a cancer survivor - in 2006, Cain had a diagnosis of stage 4 colon cancer, which also had spread to his liver.</p>

<p>He first tested positive for COVID-19 on June 29 and was hospitalized on July 1. </p>

<p>Following his death, his staff said in a statement that there is 'no way to know for sure how or where Mr. Cain contracted the coronavirus.'</p>

<p>Still, many critics blamed the Trump administration for Cain's death after the event intentionally ignored CDC public health guidelines. </p>

<p>At the time, cases were rising in Oklahoma and several other states in the midst of their re-opening plans.</p>

<p>Local health officials on the ground cautioned against the rally and a group of businesses sued to stop it - a legal move that failed.  </p>

<p>Trump pushed back on the claims that Cain contracted the virus from the Tulsa rally and told reporters, 'I don't think he did!' </p>

<p>He praised Cain as a 'good man' during a press conference after his death. </p>

<p>'He did a fantastic job. He was respected by everybody, he was loved by everybody. And we will miss Herman Cain,' said Trump.  </p>
