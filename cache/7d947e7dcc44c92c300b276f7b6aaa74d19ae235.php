<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They've been going from strength to strength since announcing their romance three months ago. </p>

<p>And Katie Price has revealed she and beau Carl Woods have decided to take things to the next level by trying for a baby AND moving in together - as well as the star dropping some strong hints that she's ready for marriage.</p>

<p>Speaking on new YouTube channel The Adventures Of Katie And Carl, the couple discussed their plans after the former glamour model purchased an ovulation kit.</p>

<p>Making plans! Katie Price and Carl Woods chatted about trying for a baby after she surprised him with an ovulation kit during their first YouTube video on channel The Adventures Of Katie And Carl on Monday</p>

<p>While holding onto the box Carl told his girlfriend he was 'glad that you got it. It's actually kind of cute that you got it.'</p>

<p>After getting over the initial shock of seeing the kit and blurting out 'for f***s sake', the hunk appeared keen on the idea of trying for Katie's sixth child, telling her that they weren't getting any younger.</p>

<p>Carl said: 'If we're going to make a baby then we need the ovulation kit. I'm 31 - I'm getting older. You're 42 - you're even older.</p>

<p>'So we need to know, don't we? I don't want to be an old dad. Do you want to be an old mum?'</p>

<p>Oh boy! After looking a little shocked at first, Carl soon got onboard with the idea and mentioned that they weren't getting any younger</p>

<p>Katie, who turned to the camera and laughed as her cheeky beau referenced her age, joked: 'I already am - but I'd like to be older.'</p>

<p>Carl then went on to say: 'It's a really good idea, Kate. Did you get this today [the ovulation kit]? And why did you buy this?'</p>

<p>Katie, who later revealed they've 'talked about a lot of things', replied: 'For the same reason you said, because of our discussions we've had.'</p>

<p>He said: 'Our discussions about having kids. This is important because if you're coming to move in, we're taking steps.' </p>

<p>Former glamour model Katie also dropped some heavy hints that she's ready for marriage number four during the video.</p>

<p>Big commitment: Katie also surprised her boyfriend with a Wedding Day Yankee Candle, dropping a not so subtle hint that she was ready to exchange vows</p>

<p>Bold: After giving Carl his cheeky gift, Katie agreed that if it had been a leap year she would have already proposed to her boyfriend of three months</p>

<p>After presenting the ovulation kit, Katie handed another bag to Carl which contained a Yankee Candle called Wedding Day. </p>

<p>Laughing at the find, Carl said: 'If it was a leap year, would you have asked me to marry you already?'</p>

<p>Not pausing for a second, Katie responded: 'Yes, without a doubt. Because I know you’re the right one.'</p>

<p>And it seems Carl has been a fan of his girlfriend's for some time as he revealed the four things he wanted Katie to bring to his Essex home were mostly Jordan related.  </p>

<p>Loved-up: The couple explained that they'll be moving in together at Carl's Essex home but still staying at Katie's abode when she has all of her five children</p>

<p>While unpacking their car Carl held up the 2004 Jordan calendar which he said 'all blokes will know to be an essential item'.</p>

<p>As well as the throwback calendar from Katie's glamour model days, two huge canvas pictures of the star were also brought into their new home,</p>

<p>Carl said: 'I don't want to date Jordan, I just like to look at her. </p>

<p>'It feels like I'm 15 again, had them all [the calendars], just different versions. Now I feel like I've gone back again and I've again got Jordan on my wall.'</p>

<p>Katie then asked her beau 'how does it feel having the person in the pictures living with you?' to which an enthusiastic Carl replied: 'I'm over the f*****g moon.'</p>

<p>Happy: After chatting about trying for a baby and marriage the pair shared a sweet kiss and got on with moving in Katie's belongings </p>

<p>Explaining their home set-up, Katie said she still has her house and will stay there when she has all her five children with her.  </p>

<p>Talking about the move in, Carl joked: 'This is where I sign my life away, because she'll be here 24/7 now.' </p>

<p>Katie and Carl have been dating for three-months now and it was claimed on Monday that they beauty is 'rushing through' her divorce so she's free to marry again.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'She's asked her team to rush it through, whatever it takes... She's keen to end the marriage so she's free to marry Carl if he proposes.'</p>
