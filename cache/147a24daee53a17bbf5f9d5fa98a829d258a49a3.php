<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Declan Donnelly's long-lost American cousins have expressed 'heartbreak', as he suggested they 'wanted nothing to do with [him]' after meeting on a DNA TV show.</p>

<p>The TV personality, 44, was seen meeting more than a dozen US-based relatives he'd never before heard of during his appearance on ITV's DNA Journey in November.</p>

<p>And while the emotional scenes appeared to be the beginnings of a strong familial bond, he has since suggested in his and presenting partner Ant McPartlin's book Once Upon a Tyne that they weren't keen on maintaining contact.</p>

<p>Writing in their tome, he recalled: 'There was also Greg and Meg, relatives of mine in Connecticut, who were lovely and... what’s the word I’m looking for?'</p>

<p>'Billionaires,' Ant responded, evoking the popular duo's TV presenting style. </p>

<p>'That’s it,' said Dec. 'I’ve emailed them a few times, but I’ve not heard anything back yet. Either I’ve got the wrong email address, or they want nothing to do with me.'</p>

<p>'I know which one my money’s on,' joked Ant, as they spoke about the encounter, which was shown on screens back in November.</p>

<p>However, the star's cousin Chris McGuigan has insisted that any such suggestion would be hugely inaccurate, telling The Sun: 'We were heartbroken to see he thinks that we would ignore him.'</p>

<p>She said: 'I was one of the cousins that was part of the DNA Journey Program in the US where we all met and filmed in Connecticut at our cousin Meghann’s home.</p>

<p>'We are stunned here [to read about the ‘ghosting’ claims] actually, because all of us have been trying to find a way to connect and follow up with Declan since the show — including Meghann.</p>

<p>'I believe there must be terrible miscommunication. Many of us have bonded and it has been wonderful. We would love to have that family connection and heartfelt feeling shared with Declan.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Declan Donnelly for comment. </p>

<p>During the show, which aired late last year, Dec was seen shocked as he discovered he had more than a dozen cousins he didn't know existed – and some of them were almost as well off as him. </p>

<p>While the pair were in the US doing research for the show, they were told that Dec had a DNA match before he went off to meet his cousin Meg and her husband Greg.</p>

<p>The couple, who were previously unknown to Dec, provided a helicopter for him to travel in and greeted him by laying out a large banner on their lawn. </p>

<p>'We have the same great, great grandparents,' said Meg, before adding: 'I have a little surprise for you, I have a few of your cousins here.'</p>

<p>More than a dozen people then entered the room and Dec was left struggling for words. </p>

<p>He said: 'Oh wow, this is amazing. I'm really emotional. Oh my goodness. Nice to meet you all. This is quite overwhelming!'</p>

<p>Dec was then introduced to another of his cousins, Tom, who was a firefighter in Manhattan that was on duty during 9/11.  </p>
