<p>Party time: Hilary Duff had someone else's birthday in mind as she attended a party in Studio City on Sunday afternoon</p>

<p>Hilary looked like the ultimate bohemian babe as she slipped her enviably fit frame into a patterned, burgundy toned maxi dress.</p>

<p>With a v-neckline and a cinched waist, the dress proved to be majorly figure flattering on Duff.</p>

<p>She slipped her feet into a pair of platform booties that came in a stunning cherry shade and featured stylish hardware around the ankles.</p>

<p>The Lizzie McGuire star styled her golden hair into a low bun and she placed a pair of sparkling gold hoops in her ears.</p>

<p>Hilary had a gorgeous leather Fendi bag slung over her shoulder and she held onto Banks' hand as she and her family made their way from their car to the party.</p>

<p>Banks looked sweet in a black and white gingham print dress and a pair of maroon Converse All Star sneakers.</p>

<p>Luca, whom Hilary shares with ex husband Mike Comrie, rocked a yellow striped shirt, some grey shorts, and a pair of trainers.</p>

<p>The entire family, besides baby Banks, wore masks during the socially-distanced birthday celebration.</p>

<p>Matthew had on a bright yellow beanie, a plaid shirt, and a pair of form fitting leggings.</p>

<p>After making their rounds and mingling with party guests, Hilary exited the gathering with a fussy Banks in her arms.</p>

<p>Matthew and Hilary wed in December of last year during an intimate ceremony held at Duff's home. They welcomed their first and only child, daughter Banks, in 2018. </p>

<p>Last week, Koma uploaded a stunning snapshot of his wife to Instagram that showed her enjoying a bubble bath. </p>
