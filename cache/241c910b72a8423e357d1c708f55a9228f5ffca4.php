<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gladys Berejiklian delivered an emotional response when asked whether Australians should accept that elderly people will be a casualty of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>The New South Wales premier appeared lost for words after being showed a clip of ex-prime minister Tony Abbott arguing nature should be allowed to 'take its course' for more elderly victims. </p>

<p>'How much is a life worth? How do you decide that as a leader?,' The Project's Carrie Bickmore asked Ms Berejiklian on Wednesday. </p>

<p>'I think what distinguishes us from other places on the planet is how much we value human life and that's a positive thing,' Ms Berejiklian replied.</p>

<p>NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian (pictured) got teary-eyed on Wednesday night as she answered an emotional question about elderly Australians and the coronavirus crisis </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian was interviewed by Carrie Bickmore (pictured) and opened up about valuing human life as well as revealing her biggest regret during the coronavirus pandemic </p>

<p>'I hope after this process, all of us take a good hard look at ourselves as to how we treat our elderly. </p>

<p>'I think we have to improve things across the board and value human life, value the wisdom and contribution they've made,' the teary premier explained. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian also revealed 'one of the big' regrets of her coronavirus response was posting an old photo of her dressed up in a superwoman costume. </p>

<p>The premier shared the hilarious throwback photo from her 21st birthday as part of the #MeAt20 challenge in April.    </p>

<p>She said the picture was embarrassing but agreed it was good to 'break the mould' and show Australians a different side of their politicians. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian also reflected on the everyday 'battle' of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and urged Australians to think about shaping the 'post-COVID' world. </p>

<p>The premier said she was always concerned that NSW could follow the same path as Victoria but she had learned a lot about managing the coronavirus.    </p>

<p>The premier (pictured) also discussed empathising with Victorian premier Daniel Andrews </p>

<p>'My anxiety remains the same, if not slightly higher, because every week we have had a number of undetected or unsourced cases. </p>

<p>'If you look back to Melbourne, Melbourne didn't get worse because of the number of cases they had, they had undetected community transmission which then unknowingly got to a stage where it did,' she told reporters last month. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian said she didn't judge premier Daniel Andrews for Victoria's explosive second wave of coronavirus and empathised with his difficult circumstances. </p>

<p>The premier said she felt optimistic about the future and was looking forward to a Christmas bound by far less restrictions than Easter earlier this year. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian (pictured) said she was hopeful about the future of the pandemic in NSW  </p>

<p>Early in the pandemic, New South Wales initially suffered the biggest number of coronavirus cases and deaths. </p>

<p>At the heart of the crisis was the doomed Ruby Princess cruise ship being granted permission to offload its passengers on Sydney Harbour.  </p>

<p>The fateful ship arrived in Sydney on March 19 and more than 2,700 disembarked the vessel with no health checks. </p>

<p>Twenty-eight people died as a result of infections from the ship and 62 people who weren't on board contracted the virus. </p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian has apologised 'unreservedly' for the fiasco.</p>

<p>'Those circumstances should and never will happen again in New South Wales.</p>

<p>'We have learnt so much since those horrible mistakes,' she said.      </p>

<p>NSW reported 17 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday including one in hotel quarantine, 15 linked to known clusters and one where the source is unknown. </p>
