<p>Even with a protective mask partially covering his instantly recognisable features, the filmmaker stood out courtesy of his trademark thick-rimmed spectacles.  </p>

<p>Allen, 84, was arm-in-arm with Soon-Yi, 49, as they made their way across the city's ordinarily bustling Park Avenue. </p>

<p>Face masks over Broadway: Woody Allen stood out on Thursday afternoon as he made an appearance in New York with wife Soon-Yi Previn</p>

<p>In accordance with current health and safety guidelines, South Korea born Soon-Yi also wore a face covering while crossing the sidewalk with her husband. </p>

<p>The couple looked relaxed during their latest public appearance, with Allen pulling a bucket hat low over his head in a further attempt to slip past unnoticed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the auteur's wife dressed down in a patterned sweater and plain blue sweatpants, teamed with running shoes. </p>

<p>There he is: Even with a protective mask partially covering his instantly recognisable features, the filmmaker stood out courtesy of his trademark thick-rimmed spectacles</p>

<p>The appearance comes six months after Allen hit back at the Hollywood stars who denounced him for alleged child abuse against Dylan Farrow, the daughter he adopted with former partner Mia Farrow in 1985. </p>

<p>The director said criticising him became 'the fashionable thing to do, like everybody suddenly eating kale.'</p>

<p>Stars including Mira Sorvino, Greta Gerwig, Colin Firth and Rebecca Hall have all since distanced themselves from the acclaimed filmmaker after working with him.</p>

<p>Controversy:  Allen recently hit back at the Hollywood stars who denounced him for alleged child abuse against Dylan Farrow, the daughter he adopted with former partner Mia Farrow in 1985 (Allen and Farrow are pictured together in 1983)</p>

<p>They did so after the #MeToo movement brought a renewed focus on allegations that the Oscar-winning star sexually assaulted his adoptive daughter, accusations he vehemently denies. </p>

<p>Allen told The Guardian: 'It's silly. The actors have no idea of the facts and they latch on to some self-serving, public, safe position.</p>

<p>'I assume that for the rest of my life a large number of people will think I was a predator.'</p>

<p>Fighting back: The director said criticising him became 'the fashionable thing to do, like everybody suddenly eating kale' (pictured with wife Soon-Yi Previn)</p>

<p>In 1992, it emerged that Allen, then aged 57, was having an affair with his partner Mia Farrow's adoptive daughter Soon-Yi Previn, then aged 21.</p>

<p>After the scandal broke, Farrow and Allen had an acrimonious and public break up, during which she accused the venerated director of sexually assaulting their adopted daughter, Dylan, seven.</p>

<p>Allen was investigated but never charged and he has vehemently maintained his innocence ever since.</p>
