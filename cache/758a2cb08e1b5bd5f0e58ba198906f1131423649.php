<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother found her teenage daughter hanging in her bedroom after she withdrew from classes ahead of her GCSEs at a £13,000-a-year private school, an inquest heard.</p>

<p>Maya Walker, 15, was a keen hockey player and 'very capable' student who was about to head into year 11.</p>

<p>But she refused to return to her £4,470-a-term school in Cardiff in September last year and became 'withdrawn' in her family home.</p>

<p>An inquest heard Maya had visited her GP and said 'there was no point in her studying and is not going to be remembered.'</p>

<p>Mother, Coral, said her daughter had told her she did not like any 'attention' from teachers at the Cathedral School, Llandaff, even when it was praise.</p>

<p>Maya Walker was found hanging in her bedroom after she withdrew from classes ahead of her GCSEs at a £13,000-a-year private school, an inquest heard</p>

<p>She said: 'From what she said to me she felt there was no point.</p>

<p>'When I talked to her in terms of school and she was feeling quite pressured because there was so many tests going on every one or two weeks.</p>

<p>'I was quite relaxed. I told her you don't have to do well in every test. You don't have to worry.'</p>

<p>Maya told her: 'If I don't do well they will give me attention. There will be attention from the teacher.'</p>

<p>Coral said: 'She didn't like attention. Maya doesn't want good attention. She didn't want any attention.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I told her once she finished GCSE exams she would feel better.'</p>

<p>The inquest heard mum Coral found Maya hanged in her bedroom on the morning of February 27 this year.</p>

<p>She had been due to take an English assessment at home later that day.</p>

<p>The 15-year-old was a keen hockey player and 'very capable' student who was about to head into year 11</p>

<p>Coral, an author and illustrator, said: 'She didn't express concerns. I did ask her. She did say she wanted my computer to do a presentation.'</p>

<p>The inquest heard Maya attended the school close to her family home in Llandaff, Cardiff and enjoyed studying science.</p>

<p>Her father David, a professor, said: 'She told me in the summer term she had seen the children in the year above her lining up to do their GCSEs.</p>

<p>'She told me then she decided she wasn't going to do that.'</p>

<p>The inquest in Pontypridd, South Wales, heard Maya had not mentioned suicide to her family but had signs of self harm.</p>

<p>She had also been found in the kitchen with a knife and was referred to mental health services.</p>

<p>Her father said: 'She said things like 'I don't see the point of living' and things of that nature. Nothing specifically that she intended to kill herself.</p>

<p>'We would ask her why she didn't want to go to school and she would say that she didn't see the point and nothing lasted.</p>

<p>'Everything was going to pass away anyway.'</p>

<p>Mother, Coral, said her daughter had told her she did not like any 'attention' from teachers at the Cathedral School, Llandaff, Cardiff, pictured, even when it was praise</p>

<p>The inquest heard Maya told her father that she thought nine or ten was the perfect age.</p>

<p>The family had been on a holiday to America in the summer before her death but Maya began revising the moment they got home.</p>

<p>She then suddenly stopped doing schoolwork and did not attend a hockey trip before term.</p>

<p>The inquest heard there was also family tensions at home after her parents briefly separated.</p>

<p>Her father added: 'The events from last September onwards are completely baffling as far as I'm concerned.'</p>

<p>The inquest continues.</p>
