<p>Mr Fonseca was strangled to death on March 18 but the women allegedly threw his torso into the sea four days later.</p>

<p>They used a print from a finger they had cut on his right hand to access his mobile and transfer the cash, and waited another 24 hours to dump the rest of his body.</p>

<p>They then kept Mr Fonseca's (pictured) dismembered body parts in two cars - including his own Mercedes - before allegedly dumping his head, forearms, hands and feet by Pego do Inferno waterfall close to the Algarve town of Tavira in Portugal</p>

<p>The indictment says they spent the three days between March 20 and 23 sending messages from his Facebook account to fool colleagues and friends into believing he was still alive.</p>

<p>They will be tried for a string of crimes including murder, desecrating a body, computer fraud and using a stolen vehicle. </p>

<p>Portuguese daily Jornal de Noticias reported Malveiro took advantage of the fact she knew Mr Fonseca 'fancied' her to give him an orange juice laced with sedative Diazepam after promising him a lap dance at his home and tying him to a chair before strangling him and dismembering him with her nurse lover.</p>

<p>Reports at the time claimed the women allegedly tried to make it look as if he had killed himself by leaving the car overlooking the sea in Cape St Vincent in Sagres.</p>

<p>They said investigators suspected the pair slipped up after throwing the torso from a clifftop fort near stunning Beliche Beach.</p>

<p>It didn't 'land' in the water and left vital clues after it ended up on dry land.</p>
