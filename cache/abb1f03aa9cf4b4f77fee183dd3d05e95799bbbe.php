<p>The former Juventus striker was making his first appearance for the side owned by David Beckham and as the A-List arrival there was a lot of expectation on his shoulders. </p>

<p>When he hit the outside of the post after 20 minutes it looked set to be a goal feast for the ex-Real Madrid forward but things unravelled and his nightmare performance was capped off with an atrocious penalty.</p>

<p>Gonzalo Higuain attempted to be the hero from the penalty spot on his Inter Miami debut</p>

<p>He missed it and a clash erupted as Philadelphia Union players celebrated in his face</p>

<p>Higuain uttered his annoyance to his opponents as the referee was forced to intervene</p>

<p>The Argentine veteran took on five Union players moments after sending his penalty over</p>

<p>At 2-0 down and with 14 minutes remaining at Subaru Park, Higuain stepped up to take a penalty in a bid to get Inter Miami back into the game. </p>

<p>His right-footed strike flew over the top of the crossbar and there were huge cheers from the Philadelphia Union players before their celebrations spilled over into the face of the anguished Higuain. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old took offence to the celebrations as he went head-to-head with five opposition players to express his anger at their lack of respect. </p>

<p>It was a nightmare debut for Higuain who arrived to great expectations from Juventus</p>

<p>He hit the post and was left reflecting on what might have been in the rain at Subaru Park</p>

<p>Anthony Fontana, Ilsinho and Brenden Aaronson all managed to out-do Higuain by finding the back of the net in a comprehensive win for Philadelphia Union.  </p>

<p>After he was unveiled Higuain expressed his motivation to excel in America, just as others had done having arrived from Europe, such as Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Wayne Rooney. </p>

<p>'I'm really happy to be here and that it's official,' he said recently. 'My goal is to try to transmit all the experience I acquired in Europe and to help the team grow.</p>

<p>'I feel good, I feel whole as a player. I'm motivated to try a new league and help the team grow. Individually, my goal is to demonstrate that I can contribute and continue playing great football here, and I hope I can achieve that because I have all the tools necessary to succeed.</p>

<p>'Inter Miami is a team in construction, but there is already a good base to reach important goals.'  </p>

<p>Brenden Aaronson struck for Philadelphia Union as they ran out comfortable 3-0 winners</p>

<p>Anthony Fontana and Ilsinho had already struck before Aaronson sealed a comprehensive win</p>
