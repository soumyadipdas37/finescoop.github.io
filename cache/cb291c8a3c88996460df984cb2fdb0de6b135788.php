<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mason Holgate has given Carlo Ancelotti a major headache before the start of the new season after he left Goodison Park on crutches.</p>

<p>Holgate, the promising Everton central defender, was hurt in a collision during the first half of his side's 2-0 win over Preston and ended up limping off. </p>

<p>He spoke to Duncan Ferguson, Ancelotti's assistant, as he left the pitch and the Scot's reaction showed the cause for concern.</p>

<p>Mason Holgate was forced off with an injury in Everton's pre-season friendly win vs Preston</p>

<p>Everton are not blessed with deep cover in central defence, as Colombian Yerry Mina is still working his way back to fitness from the thigh issue he sustained earlier this summer. Michael Keane, who is away with England, is their soul senior fit player in that area.</p>

<p>Ancelotti said Holgate had 'an issue with his toe' and he will undergo more tests on Sunday at the club's Finch Farm training base. Everton's manager refused to say whether the 23-year-old would be able to play in the opening game at Tottenham.</p>

<p>The Italian was pleased with his side's efforts in dispatching Preston - Jonjoe Kenny and Dominic Calvert-Lewin scored the goals either side of half-time - but he was most pleased about the signing of Allan, the Brazil midfielder.</p>

<p>Allan has signed a three-year deal following a £25million move from Napoli and he said the lure of reuniting with Ancelotti was impossible to turn down.</p>

<p>'It is a club with a rich history in the Premier League, has real ambition and then there is Professor Ancelotti,' said Allan. He has done everything possible to bring me here. It is the size of the Club and the name of the coach which means you don't think twice about coming to Everton.'</p>

<p>Holgate's injury will come as a huge blow to Carlo Ancelotti just a week before season starts</p>
