<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Everton’s new glamour signing James Rodriguez has told Carlo Ancelotti he is ready to make his debut at Tottenham today despite playing only once since February.</p>

<p>Rodgriguez had been frozen out by Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid before his £12million move to Everton last week but the 29-year-old Colombian superstar still believes he can hit the ground running.</p>

<p>‘I feel ready now,’ he insisted. ‘I feel really fit in myself and feel I could play right away.</p>

<p>James Rodriguez has told Carlo Ancelotti he is ready to make his debut at Tottenham</p>

<p>‘Sometimes when you’ve had a lay-off, it can be beneficial in terms of your general level of fitness and readiness. I am here to help everyone.’</p>

<p>Rodriguez earned a move to Madrid in 2014 after a string of outstanding performances and goals for Colombia at that summer’s World Cup.</p>

<p>He struggled to live up to his superstar status in Spain and spent two seasons on loan with Bayern Munich before returning to Real where he last featured on June 21.</p>

<p>James linked up with Carlo Ancelotti again to become Everton's marquee summer signing</p>

<p>Though Everton may appear a step down for someone who has graced clubs of that stature, Rodriguez has twice been signed under current Blues boss Carlo Ancelotti and spoke to his international team-mate Yerry Mina before committing to Goodison.</p>

<p>‘I spoke a lot with Yerry and also to Luka Modric about what the Premier League is going to be like,’ he revealed.</p>

<p>‘I was aware of it anyway because I have watched the league on television for many years. They told me it is intense, high tempo, up and down games. Physical strength is important.</p>

<p>‘But I believe when you know you can play football and have ability and skill, it is easier to adapt to any style of football.</p>

<p>‘There are a few South American players at Everton and of course that will make things easier, not just on the field but the day-to-day routine, getting to know the city.’</p>

<p>Everton’s last superstar signing Samuel Eto’o lasted only six months but Rodriguez is sure this new era will see more big names follow him.</p>

<p>After falling out of favour at Real Madrid, James has not played competitively for ten months</p>

<p>‘The club has shown its intent with the three signings they have made in this window (Allan and Abdoulaye Doucoure). It helps when you have a great and hugely knowledgeable manager. Let’s hope in the next few years, others want to join us.</p>

<p>‘There are serious-minded people at this club about getting Everton into the Champions League.</p>

<p>‘We have to fight hard and show consistency. We can’t afford to be up and down in our performances.’</p>

<p>In that respect, today’s starter with Spurs is a good marker. Everton tailed of at the end of last season and won just one of their last six games including a 1-0 defeat at White Hart Lane.</p>
