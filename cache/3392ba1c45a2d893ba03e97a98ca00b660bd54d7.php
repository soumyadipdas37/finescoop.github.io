<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England and Northern Ireland announced the deaths of nine more people with coronavirus today, while no more have been confirmed in Wales or Scotland.</p>

<p>A full update will be produced later today by the Department of Health, which will include deaths in care homes and also the number of new positive tests.</p>

<p>Fatalities are no longer a big measure of the progress of the outbreak and the attention of politicians and the public has turned to new infections.</p>

<p>These have been rising in recent days to such an extent that Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday announced people should start to 'limit social contact' again from Monday.</p>

<p>He confirmed new laws will allow police to issue Â£100 fines to people meeting in groups larger than six as he attempts to cut down on young people gathering.</p>

<p>The new rule, which toughens up the previous one that allowed up to 30 people to gather if from two households, will be applied across the country.</p>

<p>Senior MPs said today that the 'broad brush' approach to tightening the screw across England will mean millions living in almost Covid-free areas must pay the price for some inner cities' inability to keep a lid on infections.</p>
