<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With working from home now the new normal for many of us and with autumn well on its way, cosy clothes that we can wear around the house have shot straight to the top of our shopping lists.  </p>

<p>If you're looking for some seriously comfortable loungepants, then it might be wise to follow the hundreds of Amazon shoppers who are snapping up the Famulily Women's Casual Floral Wide Leg Pajama Lounge Pants.</p>

<p>Amazon shoppers are raving about £13.99 pants, describing them as 'incredibly comfortable', 'so soft and light' and even 'very flattering around the bum'.</p>

<p>The floral lounge pants have accumulated hundreds of positive reviews on Amazon, with shoppers raving about the super comfortable fit </p>

<p>Thanks to the use of lightweight fabric, the thick drawstring waistband and the relaxed silhouette, it's not hard to see why the Famulily Women's Casual Floral Wide Leg Pajama Lounge Pants are such a hit with shoppers. </p>

<p>With a slouchy and stretchy fit, the Famulily Wide Leg Pajama Lounge Pants are ideal for relaxing around the house. Unlike a lot of pyjama bottoms, the pants aren't elasticated, giving you extra comfort around the tummy. </p>

<p>'I have been searching for non elastic waistband pyjama bottoms for last two years,' one Amazon customer wrote in their review. 'When I've found them the fabric has been so thin that it would be immodest to wear them in front of other people. </p>

<p>'These arrived yesterday and I am delighted. The fabric is soft and non see through (I bought black ones) and the waistband is soft.'</p>

<p>The soft fabric has been mentioned in a number of reviews. The pants are made with only 30 per cent cotton, but this hasn't affected the ratings and shoppers are still impressed by the quality. </p>

<p>'I love these!' raved one shopper. 'They are just incredibly comfortable! I am 5ft 7 which is average height but quite often pyjamas bottoms are too short on me. These are the perfect length! I also love the waist band - it's really flattering on the tummy.' </p>

<p>The wide leg pants feature a high waist with drawstring for a supremely comfortable fit </p>

<p>Another happy reviewer commented: 'I am so so so happy with these! They are softest comfiest pjs I've ever owned and so affordable!' </p>

<p>They added: 'I'm 5ft 5 and the length is perfect, you wear them high waist but the waist band is so soft and stretchy I think they'd be great maternity pjs.'  </p>

<p>Thanks to the sweet floral print and non-see through fabric, the lounge pants could even be worn out of the house. While not suitable for work, a trip to the shops in these wouldn't be out of the question.   </p>

<p>One customer wrote: 'They're great for lounging around the house, but not so obviously pyjama-like that I'd feel uncomfortable wearing them outside. They're so comfy I don't want to take them off! Luckily I have another two pairs arriving tomorrow.' </p>
