<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mason Greenwood has arrived at Manchester United's training ground for the first time since being kicked out of the England squad.</p>

<p>The Red Devils striker was sent home along with City midfielder Phil Foden after the pair broke coronavirus protocols by inviting two girls to the team hotel.</p>

<p>And now Greenwood has been spotted at Carrington as he begins training with United ahead of the new season.  </p>

<p>England international Mason Greenwood has arrived at Manchester United's training ground</p>

<p>The Red Devils striker was sent home from the national squad along with midfielder Phil Foden</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will speak with Greenwood over his expulsion from the England squad, but United are determined to protect their teenage striker from any further fallout.</p>

<p>City are likely to adopt a similar policy over Foden after the young Premier League stars were sent home from Iceland in disgrace for smuggling two girls into England’s team hotel in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>Foden has not returned to training with City yet, although Pep Guardiola’s side don’t kick off the new season until a week on Monday when they play Wolves at home.</p>

<p>United also have a late start two days earlier against Crystal Palace and Greenwood was undergoing a Covid risk assessment on Wednesday to determine when he can rejoin his teammates at Carrington.</p>

<p>Solskjaer will discuss the breach of discipline with Greenwood that followed the 18-year-old’s senior England debut against Iceland, but it’s understood the emphasis will be on learning a lesson from the first controversy of his fledgling career.</p>

<p>Sources at United and City have stressed that both clubs are wary of adding to the widespread criticism of the players having already issued statements condemning the incident.</p>

<p>City slammed Foden’s ‘totally inappropriate’ actions while United said they were ‘disappointed’ in Greenwood.</p>

<p>The clubs will take into account the young age and inexperience of the two England debutants who have both made public apologies since being kicked out of the squad by manager Gareth Southgate on Monday.</p>

<p>They were denied an opportunity to win a second cap against Denmark on Tuesday night, and could be punished further by missing next month’s games with Wales, Belgium and the Danes again. </p>
