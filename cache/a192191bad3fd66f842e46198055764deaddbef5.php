<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Didier Drogba has been selected to receive the 2020 UEFA President's Award.</p>

<p>The former Chelsea and Ivory Coast striker was hailed as a 'pioneer' by UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.</p>

<p>Drogba fired Chelsea's winning penalty in the 2012 Champions League final shoot-out, steering the Blues to four Premier League titles and as many FA Cup triumphs across nine years in two Stamford Bridge spells. </p>

<p>Didier Drogba has landed the prestigious UEFA President's Award for his charitable work</p>

<p>The Chelsea icon has sought to help others since retiring from football and has a foundation</p>

<p>The 42-year-old recently failed in a bid for the Ivory Coast presidency, but has a thriving charitable foundation and is now aiming to move into football administration. </p>

<p>'Didier is a hero to millions of football fans for his achievements throughout his glittering playing career,' said Ceferin.</p>

<p>'He is a leader - a pioneer. I will remember him as a player for his skill, strength and intelligence, but above all for his insatiable appetite to succeed - a trait which is just as present in his desire to help others off the field of play.</p>

<p>'The UEFA Champions League has become the greatest club competition in the world, partly due to our clubs being able to attract the best players from around the world.</p>

<p>Alexander Ceferin said Drogba inspired millions on the pitch and is looking to help others off it</p>

<p>The UEFA chief also hailed Drogba as a 'pioneer' as he looks to enter football administation</p>

<p>'We have been lucky to have seen the likes of George Weah, Samuel Eto'o and Didier Drogba play at the very highest level. They in turn, have blazed a trail for African footballers and have given inspiration to a whole new generation to look to follow in their footsteps.'</p>

<p>Drogba will collect his award at Thursday's Champions League draw in Geneva.</p>

<p>He racked up 164 goals in 381 appearances in a trophy-laden Chelsea career, while also helping his country to three World Cup tournaments.</p>

<p>'To have won a Champions League, to have played and scored for my country at a World Cup - these are things I could only have dreamed of when I was a child,' said Drogba.</p>

<p>'There are so many children in the developing world who have the potential to become not only footballers, but also doctors, teachers and engineers.</p>

<p>Drogba will be presented with the award at the Champions League draw on Thursday</p>

<p>'This is why it is so important to help and support our youngsters to let them fulfil their dreams and aspirations.'</p>

<p>Balancing his charity work with studying for UEFA's executive master for international players (MIP) programme, Drogba continued: 'I had been thinking, "how can I keep having the same impact without playing, without using my physique, my legs and my heart?"</p>

<p>'The best way was to use my brain and think about how to stay in football and go into administration.</p>

<p>'That is why I am here - to get all the tools and skills needed to improve not only as a person but as an ambitious man who wants to contribute to the development of football.'</p>
