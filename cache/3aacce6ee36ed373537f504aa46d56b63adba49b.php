<p>In lieu of traditional runway shows, designers are altering how they will be presenting their latest collections for buyers, editors and stylists.</p>

<p>But with change comes innovation and opportunity.</p>

<p>'At Pamella Roland, like many other brands, we are stepping back and focusing on what’s most important– the clothes themselves and our customers,' Pamella Roland told the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>New norm: While New York Fashion Week is still taking place next week, due to the COVID-19 pandemic it won't look the same. In lieu of traditional runway shows, designers are altering how they will be presenting their latest collections for buyers, editors and stylists</p>

<p>In response to the unprecedented situation, The CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America) created RUNWAY360,  a digital platform which allows brands the flexibility to show their collections in a variety of formats to a global audience.</p>

<p>RUNWAY360 is the also beneficial for domestic and international press, consumers, and retailers that are currently unable to travel to New York.   </p>

<p>'The COVID-19 pandemic has upended the global fashion industry and hit New York particularly hard,' said Steven Kolb, Chief Executive Officer of the CFDA. </p>

<p>Steven is proud of how quickly the CFDA pivoted to support the needs of the industry by creating RUNWAY360. </p>

<p>While in-person shows are exciting, there is a silver lining to going virtual.</p>

<p>15 new American brands are on the NYFW schedule who Steven says 'might not have had the opportunity to share their collections to a global audience without access to RUNWAY360.' </p>

<p>The digital platform will serve as a permanent fixture for brands to use, complimenting physical events and shows throughout the year, in addition to press and retailers who want to engage with American collections. </p>

<p>All about the clothes: 'At Pamella Roland, like many other brands, we are stepping back and focusing on what’s most important– the clothes themselves and our customers,' Pamella Roland told the Daily Mail</p>

<p>Visuals: This season Pamella Roland opted to take a simpler approach to showcase her new collection in beautiful images and a video with Alanna Arrington (pictured)</p>

<p>Reevaluating: 'Regardless of what every designer chooses as the best option for their brand this season, we are all definitely still adjusting,' said Pamella</p>

<p>While the CFDA (chaired by luxury designer Tom Ford) owns the Fashion Calendar for NYFW, IMG is the biggest producer of the shows. </p>

<p>'For September 2020, we have created a variety of new options that include live and virtual presentations, digital content and distribution, programming and experiences, which will continue to evolve based on the government’s latest health and safety guidelines,' Matthew Orley, vice president, designer relations and business development, IMG, told WWD. </p>

<p>IMG anticipates just eight to 10 live events (starting with Jason Wu and ending with Tom Ford)  and roughly 15 presentations, compared to 150 in previous years. </p>

<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York Fashion Week will operate in full compliance with the existing State Department of Health's issued standards for public health and safety during the COVID-19 public health emergency. </p>

<p>Outdoor events capped at 50 persons and indoor events at 50 percent capacity and no spectators. </p>

<p>Bronx and Banco SS21 collection presentation will be showing at Spring Studios and streamed on NYFW.com. </p>

<p>'We are looking forward to incorporating new innovative ways to show the collection this season,' Natalie De-Banco, Founder and Designer of Bronx and Banco told the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>'We will be shooting with multiple cameras and we will be using a drone so viewers will see the runway from every angle including panoramic views of the iconic NYC skyline. </p>

<p>The brand is excited to premiere a virtual show for the first time and for the opportunity to invite the world to celebrate the excitement of their latest collection.</p>

<p>Half full outlook: 'We are looking forward to incorporating new innovative ways to show the collection this season,' Natalie De-Banco, Founder and Designer of Bronx and Banco told the Daily Mail</p>

<p>Front row: 'A drawback of virtual shows is that fashion is not just about seeing the clothes, it’s also about feeling and living with them. We are finding ways to adapt to this era and interpret our vision through the virtual world,' FAITH CONNEXION co-creative directors Alexandre Bertrand &amp; Myriam Bensaid told the Daily Mail</p>

<p>Kicking things off: The official spring/summer 20201 NYFW Schedule launches on Sunday, September 13th, with Jason Wu (pictured) and Harlem’s Fashion Row’s virtual fashion experience</p>

<p>Rookies: With fifteen names new to the schedule: Aknvas, Anne Klein, Colleen Allen, Dur Doux, Duncan, Frederick Anderson, Frère, Imitation of Christ, Oak &amp; Acorn, Theophilio, Venicew, Wiederhoeft, and Wolk Morais</p>

<p>For the first time ever, FAITH CONNEXION will showing at NYFW. The label will hold a digital presentation in partnership with IMG. </p>

<p>'We strongly support the digital presentation format,' FAITH CONNEXION co-creative directors Alexandre Bertrand &amp; Myriam Bensaid told the Daily Mail.</p>

<p>'Our top priority is health and safety and we believe that showing the collection digitally is best way to ensure this.'</p>

<p>But of course, showing without an in-person audience does have its limitations.</p>

<p>'A drawback of virtual shows is that fashion is not just about seeing the clothes, it’s also about feeling and living with them. We are finding ways to adapt to this era and interpret our vision through the virtual world.' </p>

<p>Up close look: 'The most gratifying benefit is the ability to give our customers and fans of the brand visuals that really showcase the workmanship and quality of each garment</p>

<p>The official spring/summer 20201 NYFW Schedule launches on Sunday, September 13th, with Jason Wu and Harlem’s Fashion Row’s virtual fashion experience.</p>

<p>While big brands like Marc Jacobs and Fenty are not on the schedule, Alice + Olivia, Anna Sui, Badgley Mischka, Bibhu Mohapatra, Carolina Herrera, Chromat, Claudia Li, Concept Korea, Dennis Basso, Eckhaus Latta, Jonathan Simkhai, LaQuan Smith, Marchesa, Naeem Khan, Nicole Miller, Veronica Beard, and Zero + Maria Cornejo, will be participating.</p>

<p>Leslie Russo, the executive in charge of global fashion events for IMG, says she expects a big future for live streams where products can be purchased.</p>

<p>Monse spokesperson Marco D'Angelo revealed that the label will be selling its already-produced autumn collection direct to show guests next week, and be taking pre-orders for its Resort 2021 collection.</p>

<p>'We have seen a trend over the last several years that fewer designers are opting to do fashion shows,' shared Pamella Roland.</p>

<p>'With the global pandemic, fashion shows have become even less important. Whether they are live or virtual, many designers are opting not do shows of any kind. </p>

<p>Pamella's attention to detail is unparalleled.  She is known for her evening wear decorated with heaps of embellishment, including intricate beadwork and frothy feathers. </p>

<p>'The most gratifying benefit is the ability to give our customers and fans of the brand visuals that really showcase the workmanship and quality of each garment. </p>

<p>'The creative flexibility and control behind a campaign video and look book also allows us to give a close-up look at the design details and the fit of every piece. </p>

<p>New era: To succeed, designers must embrance the change and run with it</p>

<p>They say to succeed in business you must run toward it.</p>

<p>'This period will definitely impact the future of Fashion Week, as we are going into a new revolutionary era of being more involved in the digital world, said Alexandre Bertrand &amp; Myriam Bensaid of FAITH CONNEXION.</p>

<p>'To move forward, we must embrace this new form of presenting collections.'  </p>

<p>The new normal can be a great thing for many U.S. brands. The shift to digital presentations reaches a broader audience and large volumes of people around the world. </p>

<p>'We are grateful to now have the capabilities to welcome buyers, editors and our Bronx and Banco customers who previously could not attend NYFW access to the show with virtual platforms now easily in place,' said the label's founder and designer.</p>

<p>'We have faith the world will come back stronger than ever and we can celebrate with our dear fashion friends from around the world again next season as we have done previously.'   </p>

<p>Pamella Roland believes that this Fashion Week will set the tone for the new normal. </p>

<p>'Regardless of what every designer chooses as the best option for their brand this season, we are all definitely still adjusting. </p>

<p>'I'm hopeful that we will all continue to work as a community to find new and creative ways to showcase our collections each season.'  </p>
