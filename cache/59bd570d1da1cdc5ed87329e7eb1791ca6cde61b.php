<p>Cate heads the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight. </p>

<p>She recently revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'.</p>

<p>Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor.</p>

<p>'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'</p>
