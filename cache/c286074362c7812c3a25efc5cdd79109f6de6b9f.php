<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother-of-seven who gave birth just nine weeks ago has revealed her devastation that her new baby daughter might not remember her - after she was diagnosed with terminal cancer just weeks after giving birth.</p>

<p>Samantha King, a former nurse from Tredworth, Gloucester, was told she has advanced lung and breast cancer after she was given scans when antibiotics failed to clear a 'chest infection' just two weeks after she gave birth to Lilah. </p>

<p>Her eldest daughter Kyra, 24, has spoken of the family's devastation after her mother was told she could have just months to live after undergoing radiotherapy and immunotherapy - and they're now raising money so the family won't lose their home. </p>

<p>After initially trying to just raise £1,000, the family have been inundated with goodwill, with their total now hurtling towards £15,000 in donations from kind strangers.</p>

<p>She said: 'I just do not know how mum is managing to stay so positive, she is amazing. Mum was fine all throughout her pregnancy. </p>

<p>'I am a carer and she has been helping me with my three children. We have always known mum to have a weak chest but we were not expecting that news.'</p>

<p>Kyra, along with older brother Nathan, 26, are Samantha's children from a previous relationship while she shared five children, Libby 10, Lacey, nine, Logan, five, Lexi, two, and Lilah, with partner of 11 years, Craig. </p>

<p>Her eldest daughter revealed that her mother decided to stop life insurance on the family home two years ago, meaning the family would have to continue to find a way to pay the mortgage when Samantha dies. </p>

<p>The mother-of-seven says her worst fear is the family losing the home they have made so many precious memories in (pictured with son Logan)</p>

<p>Of the devastating news that she now only has months rather than years to live, Samantha posted on the GoFundMe page: 'I was hoping for a different outcome but it's now time to give my children some last precious memories.  </p>

<p>'Unfortunately baby Lilah will never remember me but on the plus side she's not going to hurt like the rest of them and for that I will be grateful.'</p>

<p>She added: 'The thought of them being uprooted from their family home after I've gone absolutely terrifies me.</p>

<p>'It may seem like just bricks and mortar but this is where our memories were made, this was a family full of joy and laughter and its hard for me to comprehend that because of me being I'll my children's lives are going to cruelly change.' </p>

<p>Samantha and Craig, who are currently not married, say they hope they'll be able to walk down the aisle soon.  </p>
