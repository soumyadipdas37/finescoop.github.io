<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Customers around Australia are going crazy for the new Old El Paso tortilla pockets designed to prevent sauce and meat spilling out the bottom of burritos. </p>

<p>The newly launched product was recently spotted by a mother who shared a photo of the tortilla pockets on Facebook.</p>

<p>'Just saw these in Coles, great for the kids in lunchboxes or just at home,' she wrote. </p>

<p>Unlike taco shells or burrito wraps, the tortilla pockets are sealed at one end and have an opening at the top to place food in and ensure no filling falls out.</p>

<p>Customers around Australia are going crazy over the new Old El Paso tortilla pockets, which are perfect for mess-free Mexican dinners (pictured)</p>

<p>The pocket packets are sold at Coles and Woolworths supermarkets from $4 each.</p>

<p>The product is convenient for easy family dinners and a great alternative idea for school lunchboxes.</p>

<p>The post quickly caught the attention of other parents and Mexican fans alike who thought the tortilla pockets were a brilliant idea. </p>

<p>The product was first spotted by mum Catherine who shared a photo of the tortilla pockets to the Lunchbox Ideas Australia Facebook group and hundreds were impressed</p>

<p>'These look awesome, might have to try them out,' one man said.</p>

<p>'Had them for dinner last night, they were lovely,' another woman added.</p>

<p>A third said: 'Had these the other night. So much easier and no mess. Helps to mix all ingredients together to stuff them.'</p>

<p>Another woman said her daughter took one filled pocket burrito to school and said there was 'no sogginess'.</p>

<p>In late July another mum-of-two used a $19 three-tier serving stand from Kmart to neatly hold bowls of ingredients during family 'Taco Tuesday' nights (pictured)</p>

<p>Amanda shared photos on Facebook and described the product as 'great to use' and convenient for family dinners.</p>

<p>Using the stand is another clever idea for a Mexican night rather than scattering the bowls of food across the dinner table.</p>

<p>'When daddy's home and we have more ingredients, we put [two stands] out,' she said online.</p>
