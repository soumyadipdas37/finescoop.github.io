<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A lost portrait of the glamorous twice-divorced Anglo-Irish socialite Oonagh Guinness sparked a bidding war after it vanished for 25 years, before eventually selling for £255,000. </p>

<p>The 1931 oil painting depicts the Guinness founder's 21-year-old granddaughter who, along with her blonde sisters Aileen and Maureen, were known as the 'Golden Guinness Girls' of 1920s British society.</p>

<p>The portrait was created by royal artist Philip de Laszlo, who himself had married into the Guinness family.</p>

<p>Oonagh treasured the painting and hung it in the drawing room of her grand country home in Luggala, County Wicklow for years.</p>

<p>After her death in 1995 it was sold as part of her estate and its whereabouts were unknown, even by the de Laszlo Foundation.</p>

<p>It turned up 25 years later as part of the sale of an epic art collection kept in a swanky mansion in Atlanta, US.</p>

<p>The 52ins by 39ins painting had been expected to sell for about £40,000 but bidding on it soared past that sum and reached £255,000.</p>

<p>The piece of art is titled 'The Honourable Mrs. Philip Leyland Kindersley, nee Oonagh Guinness, later Lady Oranmore and Browne', in reference to her first two marriages. </p>

<p>She is depicted aged 21 seated and wearing a white chiffon dress with a green sash and holding a wide-brimmed hat.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for auctioneers Ahlers &amp; Ogletree Auction Gallery said: 'Upon entering the drawing room where Oonagh hung in prominence, I was immediately captivated, and it is clear that she caught the attention of our bidders as well.</p>

<p>'The sitter's gaze was enchanting, revealing her humanity and sense of humour. I can just envision sitting at Luggala amid the intelligentsia, artists, and socialites of the day, enjoying a cocktail with the belle of Irish society.</p>

<p>'The response to this important portrait was outstanding. Our staff fielded phone bids from 10 parties across England, Ireland, the US, and Belgium.'</p>

<p>Arthur Guinness started brewing ales in 1759 at the St. James's Gate Brewery, Dublin and started selling the dark beer porter in 1778.</p>

<p>Guinness stout is made from water, barley, roast malt extract, hops, and brewer's yeast. A portion of the barley is roasted to give Guinness its dark colour and characteristic taste. It is pasteurised and filtered.</p>

<p>Guinness stout is available in a number of variants and strengths, ranging from 4.1 per cent alcohol volume up to 7.5 per cent (Guinness Foreign Extra Stout).</p>

<p>Guinness heir Garech Browne, who was the son of Oonagh and Dominick, the 4th Lord Oranmore and Browne, died aged 78 in March 2018. </p>

<p>He became custodian of a 500-acre estate in County Wicklow, Ireland.</p>

<p>In 1966 his younger brother Tara was killed at the age of 21 in a car accident at Redcliffe Gardens in Chelsea, which inspired the Beatles to write A Day In The Life. </p>

<p>He told friends his heir would be Tara's eldest son, Dorian, and had no children. </p>
