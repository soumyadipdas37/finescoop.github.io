<p>The niece of Julia Roberts was first linked to Garrett back in March 2019.</p>

<p>The two had been friends prior to dating, but a source described the relationship at the time as 'casual' and 'just a couple of weeks old' to Us Weekly.</p>

<p>Garrett, who was born and raised in rural Minnesota, is best known for starring in the Oscar-nominated Netflix film Mudbound, as well as the Netflix action–adventure film Triple Frontier, in which he starred with heavyweights including Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnam and Pedro Pascal.</p>

<p>Prior to her new romance, Emma was in a seven-year on–off relationship with her AHS costar Evan Peters, 33. </p>

<p>A source told UsWeekly at the time that it was not an amicable breakup and that they were now 'just friends.'</p>

<p>New love: The niece of Julia Roberts was first linked to Garrett back in March 2019. She previously dated her American Horror Story costar Evan Peters for seven years; shown in August 2019</p>

<p>Garrett had previously been with Kirsten Dunst, 38, though they broke up in 2016 after more than four years together.</p>

<p>The actress has since moved on and gotten engaged to Breaking Bad's Jesse Plemons, 32, with whom she shares a son. </p>

<p>Us Weekly reported last month that Emma and Garrett new the sex of their baby, though they were keeping it private at the time.</p>

<p>The Little Italy actress initially tried to hide her bump while out in public, and her posting on social media has slowed to a trickle in recent months. </p>
