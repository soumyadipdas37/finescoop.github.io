<p>Witnesses claim that they saw a white car speed through a police cordon which had been set up to investigate the incident at around 2.30am.</p>

<p>The officer was standing on the edge of the pavement when the car appeared to lose control and clip him, the Metropolitan Police told MailOnline. He has been treated for shock, a spokesman for the force added. </p>

<p>It is understood the collision and the stabbing are not related.  </p>

<p>'At approximately 02:35hrs an officer responding to the incident came in close contact with a car travelling past the scene,' the Met Police said.</p>

<p>A police officer 'screamed for help' after he was hit by a car following a stabbing in north London last night, it has been claimed. The officer was responding to reports of a stabbing outside Manor House station in Finsbury Park when he was reportedly hit</p>

<p>Witnesses said they saw a white car speed through a police cordon that had been set up to investigate the incident. The officer suffered injuries to his arm and leg</p>

<p>'Fortunately, the car only brushed past the officer and did not fully collide with him. He wasn't injured but was treated by paramedics for shock.</p>

<p>'Enquiries to locate the driver of the car involved in the incident with the officer are ongoing. No arrests have been made.' </p>

<p>Community reverend Efrayim Goldstein said he was one of the first to help at around 2am, unzipping the officer's jacket so he could breath properly.</p>

<p>He said the officer had been standing behind the cordon and had signalled to the car to stop before it swerved at the last second and clipped him.  </p>

<p>'He was not breathing properly,' Mr Goldstein told the Mirror. </p>

<p>'He said 'please help me'. He was kneeling onto the other officer and then went back on to the ground. I then supported his back with my body so he could open his zip.</p>

<p>'He was lucky. He could've died. He was screaming and crying.'</p>

<p>London Ambulance Service took over at the scene.</p>

<p>The Met Police said: 'Police were called at 01:55hrs on Thursday, 10 September to reports of a stabbing at the junction of Green Lanes and Seven Sisters Road, N4.</p>

<p>'Officers and London Ambulance Service attended. A 28-year-old man was taken to hospital with a stab injury. His condition is not life-threatening. No arrests have been made and enquiries by the Central East Command Unit continue.' </p>
