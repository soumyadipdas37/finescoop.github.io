<p>The 30-year-old singer achieved the impressive feat this week after her latest album Folklore climbed back to the chart's number one spot for 'a seventh nonconsecutive week.' </p>

<p>According to Nielsen Music/MRC Data, Folklore, which was released on July 24, raked in 87,000 equivalent album units in the U.S. this week.</p>

<p>The total is comprised not only of album sales, but also track equivalent albums and streaming equivalent albums.</p>

<p>Folklore's 97% uptick in sales comes after Swift's live performance of her new single Betty at the 2020 ACM Awards on September 16 in Nashville.</p>

<p>Swift's ACM performance, the first in seven-years, was released to streaming platforms and, in terms of tracking sales, had its downloads combined with the original, studio version of Betty.</p>

<p>Whitney Houston grand total of 46 is based on the 14 weeks she spent at number one for her self-titled debut in 1986, the 11 weeks her second album earned her in 1987, The Bodyguard soundtrack's 20-weeks, and the one week her 2009 album I Look To You spent atop the chart.  </p>

<p>The Beatles are the musician/group with the most number one hits of all time with a grand total of 132 weeks spanning from their '19 chart-topping album,' while Elvis Presley holds 67 weeks at number one, making him the male solo artist with the most weeks, according to Billboard.  </p>
