<p>The family of a teenage boy who took his own life after being sexually abused by his school teacher have hit out at the decision not to jail the paedophile because he is too fat to go to prison.</p>

<p>Peter John O'Neill, 61, was given only a five-year suspended sentence at Hobart's Supreme Court earlier this month after pleading guilty to the abuse of young boys aged between 10 and 15 at schools across Tasmania during the 1980s.</p>

<p>A court heard it would be too expensive to extradite the 140kg former remedial teacher to Hobart from Canberra to serve out his sentence.</p>

<p>His medical problems include chronic back pain, spinal stenosis, incontinence and sleep apnoea. </p>

<p>The brother of one of O'Neill's victims at Dominic College in Hobart - who died by suicide before the sentencing - said it was 'appalling' the 61-year-old did not have to go to jail.</p>

<p>'As soon as the sentencing was announced from the courts, everyone just went in complete disbelief,' the brother whose identity has not been revealed for legal reasons told A Current Affair.</p>

<p>'Having a sentence like this - a totally suspended five-year sentence - is just totally appalling.'</p>

<p>The family member said in years to come O'Neill's health condition may improve and he could then live freely without facing the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>'What's to say that in one year, two year or five year's time we find that miraculously he's recovered from all his conditions and he's happily walking around enjoying a full life,' he said.</p>

<p>One of O'Neill's former students at Dominic College, Rachel Grgurevic, said it was right the ex-teacher was made to return to Tasmania to serve out his sentence.</p>

<p>'He needs to pay for what he's done. You can't put a price on somebody's life so how can you put a price on justice,' she said.</p>

<p>She previously told Daily Mail Australia the current sentence is an 'injustice'.</p>

<p>'I believe the Department of Public Prosecution should appeal the leniency of the sentence,' she said.</p>

<p>'This man has ruined so many lives [and his actions have] taken many lives as well.'</p>

<p>Previous reports have claimed it could cost anywhere between $25,000 to $40,000 to bring O'Neill to Tasmania via Medivac.  </p>

<p>His furious victims have already offered to raise the $40,000 to transport O'Neill, who requires a full-time carer, to Hobart.  </p>

<p>Former students of Dominic College in Tasmania (pictured) have posted to a Facebook group, with one saying, 'Nothing will give back what he took, but he must pay in some way'</p>

<p>'The community wants people like O'Neill in jail. The cost of his crimes has been huge. Our suffering, the harm to our mental health, is immeasurable,' a former student, who can't be named for legal reasons, told The Mercury.</p>

<p>'It would cost (up to) $40,000 to transport the obese abuser to Tasmania. We, his victims, are willing to raise that transport cost so this man has to face us and then serve his just punishment.' </p>

<p>Other students are also requesting the Director of Public Prosecutions appeal against the lenient sentence. </p>

<p>O'Neill's victims have offered to raise the $40,000 needed to transport him from Canberra to Hobart </p>

<p>'So he's gotten away with abusing kids and ruining their lives. Piece of s***. Can they appeal?' a woman wrote. </p>

<p>The court heard how O'Neill befriended one of the boys, who was 10, while working as his personal art tutor. </p>

<p>While on an overnight trip during a wild storm, the boy told O'Neill he was feeling scared.</p>

<p>O'Neill gave the boy a back massage in bed and then sexually abused him.</p>

<p>In another incident, O'Neill claimed he was sick in bed when he coaxed one 15-year-old boy to hug him. He then abused him. </p>

<p>That victim didn't come forward until his 40s because he felt he was to blame.</p>

<p>Justice Blow said O'Neill deserved to be jailed but his only option was to deliver a wholly suspended sentence as there was 'no prospect' of him being brought to Tasmania.</p>

<p>'Although I cannot impose the penalty he deserves, his life now is probably far more miserable than the lives of most prisoners,' Justice Blow told the Supreme Court in Hobart on Wednesday.</p>

<p>O'Neill is unable to travel on normal flights or any significant distance by car, while specialist medical transport by air would cost up to $40,000.</p>

<p>Justice Blow said O'Neill could not be locked up interstate and didn't have the money to pay a fine.</p>

<p>He said a home detention order was useless because O'Neill is unable to leave his house without assistance.</p>

<p>Justice Blow said O'Neill had impacted his victims' education irreversibly and many had experienced problems with anxiety, homelessness, holding down jobs, depression and drugs. </p>

<p>Justice Blow sentenced O'Neill to five years' jail, wholly suspended.</p>
