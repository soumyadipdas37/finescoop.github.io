<p>Repeat offenders: The Block's Luke and Jasmin (both pictured) found themselves at the centre of yet another cheating scandal in a teaser trailer for Sunday's upcoming episode</p>

<p>'Christian Cole came along, put this in, and then it's weird how the next day...' he said trailing off as he compared the two benches.</p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin's builder admitted their island bench had been a last minute addition, describing it as 'a midnight effort'.</p>

<p>'Yeah, he's my mini Christian Cole!' laughed Luke, 35, before an equally amused Jasmin came in and joined her husband.</p>

<p>Seeing double: Luke and Jasmin's builder (pictured) admitted their island bench (pictured) had been a last minute addition, describing it as 'a midnight effort'</p>

<p>But Daniel, 35, definitely wasn't laughing, and confessed he was worried he'd shown the other teams his unique island bench 'a bit too early'. </p>

<p>'I'll let the public decide at home,' a stony-faced Daniel added amid claims Luke and Jasmin had blatantly ripped off his design.</p>

<p>On Tuesday's episode, Luke and Jasmin were accused of cheating on their winning kids' room by judge Shaynna Blaze.</p>

<p>Giving it away: Daniel (pictured) definitely wasn't laughing, and confessed he was worried he'd shown the other teams his unique island bench 'a bit too early'</p>

<p>'It felt familiar, and then I found this,' the 57-year-old interior designer said, before pulling up a series of comparison photos on a tablet.  </p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out, with Shaynna pointing out all the similarities.</p>

<p>'Spotted wallpaper, bunk, animals, saffron, aztec, grey, white sheer,' she listed, pointing out that 'the only difference' was the chair and how they put it together.   </p>

<p>'So, you're calling it inspiration,' continued Shaynna. 'What happens is inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another.'</p>

<p>Shaynna explained that it was one thing for them to copy a design for their own home, but she reminded them that they were in a competition.</p>

<p>'You haven't changed it up enough. It's not fair on the other contestants that they can win a room, with money, on someone else's ideas,' added Shaynna.   </p>

<p>'Inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another,' Block judge Shaynna Blaze (pictured) told Luke and Jasmin</p>
