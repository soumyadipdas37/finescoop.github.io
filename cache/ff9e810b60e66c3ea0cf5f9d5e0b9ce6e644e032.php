<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris is set to enter a strict second lockdown in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm from tonight.</p>

<p>There is also a 10 person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30.  </p>

<p>Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital. </p>

<p>It comes as France yesterday recorded 14,412 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 39 deaths. </p>

<p>Paris is set to enter a strict second lockdown in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases. Pictured: Parisians drink outside at a bar last night before the restrictions bare introduced</p>

<p>The new measures introduced in Paris comes as France is seeing a squeeze on hospital.</p>

<p>Medics in the capital, along with Marseille, have been forced to postpone scheduled surgeries to free up space. </p>

<p>Patients are still facing backlogs caused by the lockdown in March and April - and more than 6,000 coronavirus patients are now being treated in French hospitals.  </p>

<p>The new measures bare striking resemblance to those introduced across the UK by Boris Johnson.    </p>

<p>The Prime Minister's 'Rule of Six' limit on the number of people socialising has now been in place for two weeks.</p>

<p>Face masks have also been mandatory on public areas including shops and public transport.</p>

<p>Tough new fines for failing to self-isolate for any one with symptoms for coronavirus also come into force across parts of the UK today.</p>

<p>People across England will be legally required to self-isolate from this week if they test positive for coronavirus or are contacted by the test and trace service.</p>

<p>If they do not they risk being hit with new fines starting at £1,000 and increasing up to £10,000 for repeat offenders or serious breaches. </p>

<p>The government has also introduced an identical 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants.</p>

<p>But it was recently claimed that the curfew did more harm than good.</p>

<p>Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has demanded an urgent review of the measure, saying it had merely resulted in people gathering in shops and homes.</p>

<p>'I received reports that the supermarkets were absolutely packed out to the rafters with people gathering,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.</p>

<p>'I think there needs to be an urgent review of the emerging evidence from police forces across the country.</p>

<p>'My gut feeling is that this curfew is doing more harm than good.</p>

<p>'It creates an incentive for people to gather in the street or more probably to gather in the home.</p>

<p>'That is the opposite of what local restrictions here are trying to do.'    </p>

<p>The UK yesterday confirmed 6,041 new infections and 35 deaths in 24 hours.</p>
