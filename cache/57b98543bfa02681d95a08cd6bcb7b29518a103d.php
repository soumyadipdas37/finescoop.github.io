<p>In addition to asking his 'single Howard Stern-esque question,' the 45-year-old actor and podcast host shared a sweet tribute to his latest guest on Instagram. </p>

<p>When asked by Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast if he 'makes love' to the Brazil native 'on a game day', the NFL let out a laugh and responded, 'Oh man, that's probably off the table'</p>

<p>'But I'm too big of a windbag for that,' the Parenthood star continued, before writing that Brady 'undoubtedly' turns the heads of male models with his handsome looks.</p>

<p>'Isn't it enough to just be the greatest quarterback ever?' he quipped. 'Now for substance, this guy has put more effort and resolve into his craft than nearly anyone else in history.' </p>

<p>He concluded: 'His dedication is astonishing and inspirational. What an incredible dude.' </p>

<p>'Isn't it enough to just be the greatest quarterback ever?' Shepard quipped, noting the NFL star is so attractive he would turn the heads of male models</p>

<p>The athlete, who shares son Benjamin, 10, and daughter Vivian, seven, with Bündchen and son Jack, 13, with ex Bridget Moynahan, also works hard off the field to be a good father and husband.  </p>

<p>'His dedication is astonishing and inspirational. What an incredible dude,' Shepard wrote; seen in August </p>

<p>In April, he revealed on the Howard Stern Show that he once skipped Organized Team Activities (OTAs) in 2018 to resolve relationship issues with his wife. </p>

<p>Brady revealed that Gisele was not happy with how much attention he was giving football and his business deals, while she was left taking care of the children and the home explained: 'She didn't feel I was doing my part for the family. </p>

<p>'She felt like I would play football all season and she would take care of the house and all the sudden when the season would end, I would be like, "Great, let me get into all my other business activities. Let me get into my football training."</p>

<p>'And she's sitting there going, "Well, when are you going to do things for the house? When are you going to take the kids to school and do that?" And that was a big part of our marriage. I had to, like, check myself. Because she's like, "I have goals and dreams too."'</p>

<p>The tensions kept mounting as it all reached this tipping point, where Gisele wrote him a letter explaining what she saw as the flaws in their relationship, and they ended up going to therapy.</p>

<p>He explained that he still keeps the note close to him as he said: 'I keep it in a drawer. I read it and it was a heartfelt letter that said this is where we are in our marriage.' </p>
