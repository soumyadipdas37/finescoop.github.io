<p>The soap star first showed off his impressive weight loss in March, but has been continuing to slim down while in lockdown as he kept up with his fitness routine at home. </p>

<p>Colson recently spoke about how his staggering weight loss will likely cause continuity issues on Coronation Street during filming.   </p>

<p>The star joked he will have to wear a fat suit after claiming to have lost 10 stone during lockdown.</p>

<p>Colson told The Sun: 'We are in direct continuity, but I've almost lost about ten stone since we left work so I'm not sure that [my hair] is going to be the biggest of their issues.</p>

<p>'I might be wearing a wig and a fat suit when we go back. Now we go to a purple shampoo, which almost makes it a platinum sort of colour, which basically takes the ginger pigment out.</p>

<p>'So the yellow-ness will go, and I will have a head of blonde hair, which I technically do now.'</p>

<p>Amazing job: Amid the COVID-19 lockdown, Colson had been working on his fitness and often shared snaps of his workout routine</p>
