<p>Captioning the sun-soaked shot, he wrote: 'Lovely lunch today with the Lee's. Happy birthday <?php echo e('@'); ?>brittanyfurlan!' </p>

<p>His latest post comes two weeks after he first broke his social media silence with a video of him and Ella dancing in honor of Kelly. </p>

<p>John could be seen twirling his daughter to the soft strains of jazz music, seemingly played by a trio of piano, bass and drums.</p>

<p>'My daughter <?php echo e('@'); ?>ella.travolta and I dancing in memory of momma. One of Kelly’s favorite things to do with me,' John wrote in his caption. </p>

<p> Kelly and John were married from 1991 until she died tragically aged 57 of cancer last month at the family home in Florida.</p>

<p>Along with Ella, John and Kelly also shared two sons, including their youngest child Benjamin, nine.</p>

<p>Honour: His latest post comes two weeks after he first broke his social media silence with a video of him and Ella dancing in honor of Kelly</p>

<p>The family was struck by tragedy in 2009 when their eldest son Jett struck his head in the bath, suffered a seizure and died at only 16.</p>

<p>It was announced in July that Kelly died from breast cancer after a secret two-year battle with the disease.</p>

<p>She was pronounced dead at 11:46am on July 12 at the family home in Clearwater, Florida, Us Weekly reported last month citing official documents. </p>

<p>John, who played husband and wife with Kelly in the 2018 mafia biopic Gotti, announced her death on Instagram.</p>

<p>RIP: She was pronounced dead at 11:46am on July 12 at the family home in Clearwater, Florida </p>

<p>He penned at the time: 'It is with a very heavy heart that I inform you that my beautiful wife Kelly has lost her two-year battle with breast cancer. She fought a courageous fight with the love and support of so many. </p>

<p>'Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered, I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while,' the Grease icon continued. </p>

<p>'But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal.'</p>
