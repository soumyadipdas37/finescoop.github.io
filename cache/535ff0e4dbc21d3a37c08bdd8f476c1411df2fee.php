<p>Premier League clubs are set for their second match-day of 2020-21 behind-closed-doors this weekend amid a backdrop of worrying coronavirus infection numbers and stress over a second lockdown.     </p>

<p>However, West Ham vice-chairman Brady is confident that fans could safely attend matches amid the protocols already in place at grounds - with the Government allowing some clubs to have 1,000 fans watch live his week. </p>

<p>West Ham vice-chair Karren Brady insists football is ready to welcome fans back to games </p>

<p>Brady believes fans are safer in football stadiums than in their own living rooms at home </p>

<p>'Premier League football stadium is the safest place you can be. Safer than your own living room,' Brady told the Sun. </p>

<p>'Our highly supervised environment means supporters are safer in there than if they were mixing informally in their own homes.  </p>

<p>'The precautions taken against players catching it have been exhaustive and highly successful. Staff have become expert testers and players, with very few exceptions, have not strayed.</p>

<p>'The Government trusted us to restart last season and we should by now have earned its support in staging matches in front of crowds.  </p>

<p>The Premier League is getting into its second 2020-21 match-day behind-closed-doors</p>

<p>'Frankly, 1,000 spectators in, say, West Ham’s London Stadium — which has 66,000 seats — is so wide of that objective it rivals me in high heels shooting for goal from 25 yards. It is both laughable and irrelevant.'</p>

<p>With infection rates rising rapidly in Spain and France, the UK is weighing-up its options to get ahead of another spiral - with curfews, local lockdowns, shielding of vulnerable people and a second nationwide lockdown all being considered. </p>

<p>Travel to and from games as well as supporters mixing pre and post-match are additional issues football must consider but as with the wider economy, the game's financial worries are at the heart of the push to bring fans back.  </p>

<p>Clubs are desperate for fans to return as they are losing millions in revenue each month </p>

<p>'My plea for the return of sizeable crowds is by no means all about the loss of revenue although the sums are eye-wateringly large,' Brady admitted, explaining that clubs are losing around £80m in match-day revenue every month.</p>

<p>The Bundesliga paved the way for the rest of the world with its restart and German clubs are already filling 20 per cent of their stadiums. </p>

<p>While the UK Government's more cautious approach is unlikely to see that implemented, the Premier League has hopes to welcome more fans back in October.   </p>

<p>For now, though, fans remain in limbo.  </p>
