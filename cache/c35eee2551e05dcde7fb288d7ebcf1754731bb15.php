<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amazon has been slammed for selling racist caps with the slogan 'Black Lives Don't Matter' - marketed as 'elegant' and a 'nice present'. </p>

<p>The offensive headgear was spotted by barrister Alexandra Wilson, who tweeted: 'This is not ok. <?php echo e('@'); ?>Amazon why is this racist hat being sold on your site? Are there no checks in place? This is honestly embarrassing.' </p>

<p>The online retail giant later removed the £12.96 caps, which were sold by a third party seller. </p>

<p>The offensive headgear was spotted by barrister Alexandra Wilson, who tweeted: 'This is not ok. <?php echo e('@'); ?>Amazon why is this racist hat being sold on your site? Are there no checks in place? This is honestly embarrassing.</p>

<p>A description, written by the seller, said the items were 'high quality' with a 'unique and fashionable' design that made them a 'nice present for family and friends'. </p>

<p>Ms Wilson, 25, tweeted after the caps were removed: 'The largest online company sold caps telling us that "Black Lives Don’t Matter". </p>

<p>'We spoke up and it’s finally gone. The power of social media. Imagine if the big companies and celebrities who posted a black square on social media used their platform to let activists speak? </p>

<p>'Thank you to everyone who contacted Amazon directly. These small actions make a big difference. No one should ever have to see anything like this.'</p>

<p>Last month Amazon was called out by the actress Sally Phillips for selling T-shirts bearing slogans including 'Let's make Down Syndrome [sic] extinct'. </p>

<p>The actress, 51, who lives in London, has three children, the oldest of which, Olly, 16, has Down's syndrome.</p>

<p>She described the offensive tops - which feature slogans including 'F*** Down's syndrome' - as 'hatewear' that demonstrate eugenic ideas 'are really taking hold'.  </p>

<p>Amazon said, in reference to the racist hats: 'All sellers must follow our selling guidelines and those who do not will be subject to action including potential removal of their account. </p>

<p>'The product in question is no longer available.'</p>
