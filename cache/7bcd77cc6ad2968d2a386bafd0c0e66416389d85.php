<p>Langdon clashed with co-host Karl Stefanovic, 46, on Thursday morning and even tipped Trump, the current US president, to win the election. </p>

<p>Today show host Allison Langdon (pictured right with Karl Stefanovic) condemned both candidates in the US presidential election on Thursday morning </p>

<p>Trump and Biden repeatedly insulted and shouted over each other as Fox News moderator Chris Wallace struggled to control the 'chaotic' debate.</p>

<p>Langdon slammed the event for being 'more like 90 minutes of schoolboys bickering than a presidential debate'.   </p>

<p>Biden, former vice president to Barack Obama, even asked the president 'will you shut up, man?'.  </p>

<p>Langdon said she 'expected a little bit more' from Trump during the 'outrageous' debate. </p>

<p>'The man who was on stage yesterday was an absolute disgrace. It's been called the worst debate ever, a dumpster fire, a train wreck. He was rude, he had no plan. </p>

<p>'I found the whole thing just outrageous I though he'd be a little bit better than that, I thought he'd have the decency to at least let the other person speak,' she said. </p>

<p>The Today host also slammed Biden and explained she 'didn't think he did a very good job either'.   </p>

<p>'Trump could very well win the election, I don't think Joe Biden won himself any fans last night,' Langdon said.   </p>

<p>Langdon and Stefanovic also got into an on-air row while discussing the election with Harlan Hill, an advisor for Trump's campaign.    </p>

<p>Stefanovic addressed Hill about media coverage of the election and said 'the people who are fronting shows get very upset about Donald Trump'. </p>

<p>Langdon interrupted him and explained 'I'm not defending Joe Biden here'. </p>

<p>'No, I haven't finished yet,' her Stefanovic bit back.  </p>

<p>The pair bickered again after ending their call with Trump's campaign advisor.    </p>

<p>'Everyone gets fired up about it but it's America that votes... it's not got anything to do with what our opinions are or anything,' Stefanovic said. </p>

<p>Langdon replied 'but it was a sad sight when the leaders of the free world...' </p>

<p>'He's been sad for years,' Stefanovic interrupted. </p>

<p>Langdon bit back and asked 'so therefore it's okay?' </p>

<p>'I'm not saying it's okay, I'm just saying what do you expect,' her Stefanovic explained.   </p>

<p>'I think it's fair to expect a little more than what we got,' Langdon replied.      </p>

<p>The next US presidential debate will be held in Miami, Florida, on October 15. </p>

<p>Langdon (pictured) said she 'felt sorry for every single person in America' but predicted that 'Trump could very well win the election'</p>
