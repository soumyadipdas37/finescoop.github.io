<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dan Evans slipped to an agonising marathon defeat in the cold of the French Open after being edged out of a topsy turvy first round by former world number four Kei Nishikori.</p>

<p>With temperatures lagging in the mid-fifties on the first day of the rescheduled Grand Slam, the British number one went down 1-6 6-1 7-6 1-6 6-4 to the 30 year-old from Japan.</p>

<p>For a while it looked like that Evans would emerge the winner from a battle that last three hours and 49 minutes, and it is one several tight matches in recent weeks that have got away from him. </p>

<p> Dan Evans suffered first-round disappointment at the French Open following a five-set defeat</p>

<p>Japan's Kei Nishikori was able to fend off the resilient Brit to advance to the next round</p>

<p>Evans found himself having to fight from behind after Nishikori took a 2-1 lead at the third-set</p>

<p>He will look forward to getting on quicker terrain for what remains of the season.</p>

<p>Although ranked higher, an Evans win would have been considered an upset given their very contrasting history of clay court results.</p>

<p>Nishikori has reached the quarter finals at Roland Garros three times, and the last sixteen on another three occasions, while Evans has traditionally struggled on the slower surface.</p>

<p>Evans set up a thrilling finale after a dominant fourth-set performance taking it to a fifth-set</p>

<p>Nishikori bounced back in the final-set 6-4 to progress to the second round of the French Open</p>

<p>Yet he will look back at certain points of the match and know he could have clinched it against a player with little recent form to fall back on.</p>

<p>Evans served for the third set after coming back from 2-5 down, and had a break point at 3-3 in the decider which he could not convert. In the end the famed quality of Nishikori’s service returns just about got him through a match played before a few dozen spectators, given that only 1,000 were allowed in across the whole site.</p>

<p>Jo Konta and Andy Murray were due to play their first rounds later on Sunday.</p>

<p>It was frustration for Evans after a rollercoaster of a match which lasted just under four hours</p>
