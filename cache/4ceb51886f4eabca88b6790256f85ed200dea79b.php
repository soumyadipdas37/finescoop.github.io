<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Footy WAG Rebecca Judd has been happily married to retired AFL star Chris Judd for the past decade.</p>

<p>But the 37-year-old took a trip down memory lane on Tuesday as she reminisced about the 'type' of guy she used to date before she met the footballer.</p>

<p>Rebecca said on the 3pm Pick-Up that she actually had a thing for British DJs while in her late teens.</p>

<p>Say what?! Rebecca Judd took a trip down memory lane on Tuesday as she reminisced about the 'type' of guy she used to date before she met  AFL champion Chris Judd </p>

<p>'I was really, really into DJs. If they were a drum and bass DJ, then extra points. If they were from the UK, extra points,' Bec told her co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond.</p>

<p>'And if they were Reebok classic sneakers, loved them!'</p>

<p>Rebecca revealed she had a wild streak in her youth, and would 'sneak into clubs' when she was 16 and 17 to check out who was on the decks.</p>

<p>'If they were from the UK, extra points!' Rebecca said on the 3pm Pick-Up that she actually had a thing for British DJs while in her late teens. Pictured as a teenager</p>

<p>'I used to sneak into this club when I was 16 or 17, and it was called the Drum Club with my fake ID and my braces. Acne,' she recalled. </p>

<p>Despite her adolescent forays into dance music culture, Rebecca said she was glad she ended up with an Aussie sportsman. </p>

<p>Monty pointed out that while DJs may seem appealing to younger women, their lifestyles are actually 'revolting'. </p>

<p>All's well that ends well: Despite her adolescent forays into dance music culture, Rebecca said she was glad she ended up with an Aussie sportsman </p>

<p>'Ugh. Foul. Foul,' Rebecca replied. '"I'm just going to do my shift. My 1am till 4am shift." Gross!' </p>

<p>She concluded by saying that one particular crush of hers, DJ Frantik, scored extra points because his family owned the local fish and chip shop.</p>

<p>'I really liked him back in the day,' she said. </p>

<p>He's the one: The Postcards host married Chris, a former captain of two AFL teams, in 2010</p>

<p>'He did shifts [at the fish and chip shop] during the week - so he had multiple careers,' she added.</p>

<p>'But he already had a girlfriend who was manager of the local Macca's. She was the manager, so she had extra street cred.'</p>

<p>'I wish you ended up with DJ Frantic so bad,' Monty laughed. </p>

<p>Happily ever after! The couple share four children: son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and three-year-old twin boys Tom and Darcy</p>

<p>'I would have inherited the fish and chip shop! Love it,' Rebecca replied. </p>
