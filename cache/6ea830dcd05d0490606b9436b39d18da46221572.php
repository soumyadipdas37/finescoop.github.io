<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal are reportedly set to waste no time in addressing their goalkeeping situation and make a £10million bid for Brentford's David Raya.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta's side are on the verge of shaking on a £20m agreement to see Emiliano Martinez switch to Aston Villa this summer, to become first choice at Villa Park.</p>

<p>And Arsenal will then directly invest half of these funds into signing Raya from Thomas Frank's Bees, according to the Sun.</p>

<p>Arsenal are being linked with a £10m move to acquire David Raya from Brentford</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Raya is said to be keen to play Premier League football, though would be brought in as understudy to Bernd Leno.</p>

<p>Arteta has already decided the German is to be his No.1 stopper, despite Martinez starring in both recent FA Cup final and Community Shield successes.</p>

<p>It is reported that the knock-on effect would see Brentford look at Charlton’s Dillon Phillips as a replacement.</p>

<p>On Saturday Arsenal officially kicked off their new Premier League campaign with a convincing 3-0 win over newly promoted Fulham.</p>

<p>FA Cup hero Emiliano Martinez is set to seal a £20m switch to Aston Villa this week</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta knows he will receive a cash injection to transfer funds as a result of the deal</p>

<p>Leno was back between the sticks for the Gunners, and kept a clean sheet behind new central defender Gabriel.</p>

<p>Martinez was out of the squad for the game, instead preparing for his medical as he edges closer to Villa Park. </p>

<p>The Argentinian has agreed a long-term contract believed to be worth around £60,000-a-week to join Dean Smith’s team, and will represent a injection into the transfer kitty for Arsenal. </p>
