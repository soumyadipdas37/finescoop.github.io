<p>Agent: The actor, 43, has been one of the bookies favourites to become the next 007 in recent years, and rumours have been circulating he will step into Daniel's shoes (pictured)</p>

<p>Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: 'A flurry of bets over the past 24 hours suggests the cat is out the bag and it's Tom Hardy that'll soon be replacing Daniel Craig as 007.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Tom's representatives and EON Productions for comment. </p>

<p>The Taboo star has made no secret about wanting to be the next 007 - but has previously refused to talk about the part in fear it will get him blacklisted.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Daily Beast, the heart-throb admitted: 'If I mention it, it's gone.</p>

<p>'You know, there's a saying amongst us in the fraternity of acting, and in the fellowship of my peer group, that if you talk about it you're automatically out of the race.</p>

<p>The next Bond? The Vulcan Reporter reports they heard in June that Hardy had been offered the iconic part after a successful audition (pictured in 2018)</p>

<p>'So I can't possibly comment on that one!'</p>

<p>Tom was happy to throw his support behind Inception director Christopher Nolan, however, who has revealed he would be keen take over the franchise. </p>

<p>'Oh, wow, Chris would be amazing!' Tom gushed. 'Wow, that would be cool. That would be so cool.'</p>

<p>The hunt for a new Bond began in 2016 when Daniel, 50, admitted he was 'over it' after being cast in the role since Casino Royale in 2006.</p>

<p>'... I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists,' he told TimeOut when asked whether he would do another Bond film.</p>

<p>'No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.'</p>

<p>Since the speculation began the likes of James Norton, Tom Hiddleston, Idris Elba and even retired footballer David Beckham have been mentioned as possible replacements. </p>

<p>Exciting: Daniel looks suave as James Bond a in an action-packed new poster for No Time To Die, which was released on Wednesday</p>

<p>The 25th film in the franchise finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. </p>

<p>Leaving his seemingly happy live with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), Bond returns to the field to face Safin who is armed with a new dangerous technology that could impact the world. </p>

<p>In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20. </p>

<p>The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change. </p>
