<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If fans have returned by January 16, when Manchester United travel to Anfield in the Premier League, Andy Robertson thinks Marcus Rashford could receive a standing ovation from the Kop.    </p>

<p>The striker become football's star of lockdown when he successfully lobbied the Government to reverse its decision on ending the free school meals scheme amid the pandemic. </p>

<p>Robertson himself gave a crucial donation to Glaswegian helpline Back Onside, and is setting up his own AR26 charity, aiming to help those less fortunate through football.  </p>

<p>Liverpool star Andy Robertson was impressed by Marcus Rashford's lockdown off-field work</p>

<p>The Manchester United striker set about lobbying the Government over free school meals</p>

<p>Rashford's success leads Robertson to believe Anfield could applaud the striker when he visits</p>

<p>Robertson was also involved in Jordan Henderson's Players Together fund during lockdown, and was highly impressed with the work of his rivals' front-man too.  </p>

<p>'The two words that everyone's saying (during the pandemic) are "Marcus Rashford"', the left-back told the Times.  </p>

<p>'He made politicians overturn the decision (not to extend free school meals) because he wanted every kid to get fed. What he's done was amazing, outstanding.</p>

<p>'Once the fans are back in, Marcus Rashford could be the first Man United player to get a standing ovation here. </p>

<p>Robertson made his own contributions for those struggling during lockdown in Glasgow </p>

<p>'He'd definitely deserve it because thousands of families are getting fed now.' </p>

<p>After applauding him Liverpool would quickly have to turn their attention to stopping Rashford when they face-off, with the Englishman stepping-up on the pitch as well as off it last season. </p>

<p>Virgil van Dijk will be the principle centre-back charged with marking Rashford, but the powerful Dutchman got his season off to a rocky start last weekend.  </p>

<p>The former Ballon d'Or runner-up conceded three goals and was at fault for Patrick Bamford's 30th minute equaliser in a 4-3 victory over newly-promoted Leeds United, but Robertson was keen to remind viewers of the centre-back's world class quality.  </p>

<p>Virgil van Dijk had a rocky start to his Premier League season but his team-mate is backing him</p>

<p>'When he makes a mistake everyone's shocked and that shows how good a player he is,' Robertson added. </p>

<p>'It's a bit like when Lionel Messi misses a chance.</p>

<p>'He has the whole package as a centre back: so strong in the air, physical, fast, good on the ball, a leader, he commands. He's amazing to play with.'</p>
