<p>Family man: Mel Gibson, 64, looked rugged in a polo shirt with a popped collar as he made a grocery run in Malibu on Saturday with his younger girlfriend Rosalind Ross, 30, and their son Lars, three</p>

<p>Gibson was dressed in an independence blue polo shirt with the collar popped for a youthful look.</p>

<p>He also wore a pair of navy shorts with black sneakers and black socks, and he covered his head with a gray baseball cap. </p>

<p>Rosalind was dressed more casually in a black hoodie and loose-fitting black pants with matching sandals.</p>

<p>She had a white mask down around her neck, while her filmmaker husband brought along a red bandana to ward off the novel coronavirus. </p>

<p>Back in black: Rosalind rocked a black hoodie and matching pants while Lars wore a black T-shirt and teal shorts. Gibson was out after having been hospitalized for COVID-19 in April</p>

<p>Gibson was first revealed to be in a relationship with Ross, a writer and former champion equestrian, in 2014, and he welcomed his ninth child with her in 2016.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, it was reported that Saban films had acquired the rights to Gibson's next film, the dark comedy Fatman, in which a disgruntled child hires a hitman (Walton Goggins) to assassinate Santa Claus (Gibson) after he finds a lump of coal in his stocking.</p>

<p>Gibson has recently found more acting work with the well-reviewed crime thriller Dragged Across Concrete and a string of low-budget action films, and he returned to directing with 2016's inspiring war film Hacksaw Ridge, about a pacifist combat medic.</p>

<p>Gibson was shut out of Hollywood for years following a 2006 DUI arrest, in which he was found speeding with an open alcohol container in his vehicle.</p>

<p>The arrest report described an anti-Semitic tirade from the conservative Catholic in which he said to the arresting officer, 'F**king Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world. Are you a Jew?'</p>

<p>Holiday fare: It was reported that Gibson's upcoming dark comedy Fatman, in which he plays a Santa being hunted by a hitman for leaving a kid a lump of coal, had been picked up for distribution; shown in 2017</p>

<p>Over the summer, a 2010 G! interview with Winona Ryder resurfaced in which the Age Of Innocence actress claimed Gibson called her an 'oven-dodger,' referencing her Jewish ancestry and the Holocaust.</p>

<p>'I was at one of those big Hollywood parties. And he was really drunk,' Ryder said at the time.</p>

<p>'I was with my friend, who's gay. [Gibson] made a really horrible gay joke. And somehow it came up that I was Jewish. He said something about "oven dodgers," but I didn't get it. I'd never heard that before.'</p>

<p>Ryder renewed the accusation in June during an interview with The Sunday Times. </p>

<p>Back in the game: Gibson hasn't acted much since 2006, when he was blacklisted for an anti-Semitic tirade during a DUI arrest. In 2010, Winona Ryder claimed he called her an 'oven-doger' in an interview with GQ; pictured in March</p>
