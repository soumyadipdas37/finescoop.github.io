<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Turia Pitt has revealed how her life has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic hit just months after giving birth to her second child with fiancé Michael Hoskin.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Australian Women's Weekly, the mother-of-two shared details of how the couple have been engaged for more than five years - but planning their wedding day is the furthest thing from her mind right now.</p>

<p>'We've been engaged for five years and when I introduce him to people, I feel like saying "this is my husband," but then he's not actually my husband. So who knows what's happening with our wedding?' she told the magazine.</p>

<p>'Since the engagement, we've had two kids, and now there's coronavirus. We don't want to add in anything else just now.'</p>

<p>The mother-of-two shared details of how she and her fiancé Michael Hoskin have been engaged for more than five years - but planning their wedding day is the furthest thing from her mind right now (pictured together)</p>

<p>The couple announced their engagement in July 2015 after Michael popped the question when they were holidaying in the Maldives.</p>

<p>Michael had proposed to Turia with the diamond ring he purchased as she lay in intensive care after suffering horrific burns to 65 per cent of her body during an outback ultramarathon in September 2011.</p>

<p>Turia who has been undergoing surgeries over the past decade said her scheduled operations for the year have also been put on hold due to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>'The operations I have now are not life-saving. It's all about improving, and if I want to improve, then having the operations is part of the deal. Typically, I would try to have two operations a year but they haven't been on because of COVID-19,' she told AWW.</p>

<p>But despite the setbacks, she has been enjoying motherhood at her south coast home after welcoming her baby boy Rahiti in January. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, she shared her struggles after the country's catastrophic bushfire brought back haunting memories from a traumatic experience in 2011.</p>

<p>Despite the setbacks, the mum-of-two has been enjoying family time at her south coast home (pictured with her baby Rahiti and two-year-old son Hakavai)</p>

<p>Earlier this year, she welcomed her second baby boy into the world Rahiti (pictured together)</p>

<p>She was just 24 years old at the time when she was trapped after an out-of-control blaze ripped through a gorge in the Kimberley Region of Western Australia.</p>

<p>Turia said she was filled with emotions when she noticed the devastating bushfires that surrounded her family home.</p>

<p>'It's been a tough few weeks for me emotionally. I've had to focus on not letting my emotions and own experiences get the better of me,' she said at the time.</p>

<p>'I've tried to not let the panic genie out of the bottle (because once that genie's out, you've got zero chance of squashing it back in). And I'm exhausted.</p>

<p>'I feel like I've done 10 marathons. And we can't relax because it's only the start of summer, and it's not over yet. So just like in a marathon, I've realised I have to pace myself.'</p>

<p>During the bushfires, Turia said she was having 'recurring nightmares about running through flames with my son in my arms'.</p>

<p>'It's been difficult to sleep, eat or think and all I've really wanted to do is tap out, put my head in the sand and pretend that nothing is going on.'</p>

<p>The mother said her family spent Christmas and New Years Eve in their hometown as they watched the sky turn 'red and black' over the days.</p>

<p>'More fires broke out... I watched, my mouth agape, as two angry plumes from the fires north and south of us joined together over Mollymook Beach,' she said.</p>

<p>'And then, the power went out. Mobile reception became spotty. Internet was down. Rumours swirled around town like the ashes that rained down on us.</p>

<p>'Embers in our backyards. Homes had been lost. Whole streets obliterated. A girlfriend's panicked text about her dad being trapped.'</p>

<p>Instead of hearing music pumping and people celebrating along their street during the count down to midnight, Turia said their evening was 'quiet'.</p>

<p>'Not a peaceful and serene quiet, but an eerie quiet. An apocalyptic quiet. No one on their balconies drinking beers,' she recalled.</p>

<p>'No music blaring from our neighbours next door, or from the houses across the street. No revellers preparing to celebrate the New Year.</p>

<p>'And it was dark. No power. No lights.'</p>
