<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More than half of medium-sized businesses are planning to make job cuts as Rishi Sunak prepares to close the Government's furlough scheme at the end of October.   </p>

<p>A new survey showed many firms are expecting to make at least some of their workforce redundant as the Chancellor removes state subsidies for wages. </p>

<p>Research conducted by business advisory company BDO found nine out of 10 businesses had already axed up to a fifth of their staff. </p>

<p>But the end of furlough means many more job losses are expected in the coming months. </p>

<p>Fewer than 10 per cent of firms which responded to the survey said they had no plans to make job cuts.</p>

<p>Rishi Sunak will close the Government's furlough scheme at the end of October. The Chancellor is pictured during a visit in London on September 2</p>

<p>The furlough programme has seen the Government pay 80 per cent of an employee's monthly wages up to a maximum value of £2,500.</p>

<p>From this month the Government will only contribute 70 per cent of wages,  reducing to 60 per cent in October, before the furlough scheme is closed. </p>

<p>Leaders of medium-sized businesses have expressed concern over funding arrangements, with a third saying they can't continue trading for longer than six months based on their current outlook, according to the BDO survey.</p>

<p>Two out of five respondents reported the same or an increase in revenues compared to the same time last year. </p>

<p>Paul Eagland, managing partner at BDO, said: 'These figures highlight some of the very tough challenges and decisions businesses are faced with.</p>

<p>'The leisure and hospitality sector, in particular, is facing the double-whammy of both the furlough support and Eat out to Help Out schemes ending.</p>

<p>'The Government took bold action with its furlough policy which has undoubtedly saved many jobs and businesses.</p>

<p>'However, the harsh reality is that these are unprecedented times and we would encourage the Government to introduce policies that will help UK business survive and ultimately compete internationally.</p>

<p>'Other governments around the world are and will be introducing policies to protect their businesses.</p>

<p>'We must not fall behind, particularly with Brexit looming.' </p>

<p>Official statistics published last month suggested the UK economy was still heavily reliant on furlough. </p>

<p>One in eight workers were recorded as still being on furlough in the Office for National Statistics' fortnightly survey into the impact of coronavirus on UK firms.  </p>
