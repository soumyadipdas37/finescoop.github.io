<p>'With President Trump at her helm, America stands a chance of restoring her principles, pride, independence and true place in the world as a beacon for liberty and hope for all,' she wrote in the letter. </p>

<p>'This to me, is what "Make America Great Again" means. Looking back at your country's foundation, and preserving what makes it truly GREAT. </p>

<p>'But also knowing that the best is yet to come.</p>

<p>'All the above achievements will be torpedoed with a Biden/Harris presidency, and the dream of America's enemies to see her weak and on her knees would be fulfilled.'</p>

<p>She warned America that it was 'at the very edge of a precipice'. </p>

<p>'America, you are at the very edge of the precipice. Please wake up! Take hold! Fight for your country, and be proud of your roots! Uphold your values,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'Stand for your flag and your anthem. Defend your history. Don’t relent in the face of those who seek to re-write it to serve their narrative and justify the destruction of your nation. </p>

<p>'You have much to cherish and protect for your sake, and ours.'</p>

<p>She praised Trump, listing the ways she believed he had 'made the world a much safer place since taking office'. </p>

<p>'America, you are at the very edge of the precipice. Please wake up! Take hold! Fight for your country, and be proud of your roots! Uphold your values,' she wrote in the letter. </p>

<p>She claims Donald Trump is the only president who can prevent another a similar terrorist attack on the United States like the one committed by her uncle Osama bin Laden</p>

<p>Bin Ladin praised Trump, listing the way she believed he had 'made the world a much safer place since taking office' </p>

<p>'To name a few achievements: he stood up to China, kept us out of new wars, made Europe comply with their NATO requirements, solidified ties with Israel, overturned the disastrous Iran deal, obliterated ISIS, took down other key terrorists, and facilitated a historic peace deal between Israel and the UAE,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'His administration has also made Christian persecution worldwide a top priority with the State Department instituting the Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom, the first of its kind.'</p>

<p>The letter advocating for Trump's reelection comes after Noor bin Ladin's interview with the New York Post, in which she warned that if Joe Biden is elected, another attack may be on the way, as she claimed that leftists in the US have aligned themselves with radicalism. </p>

<p>She blamed the Obama/Biden administration for allowing ISIS to become more powerful and said that Trump is the only person to stop it happening again. </p>

<p>'Trump has shown he protects America and us by extension from foreign threats by obliterating terrorists at the root and before they get a chance to strike.'</p>

<p>Bin Ladin was born and lives in Switzerland but claims that she is an 'American at heart' and had a US flag in her childhood bedroom having frequently visited the country with her mother since she was three years old. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old Noor bin Ladin has kept a low profile despite her infamous last name but she gave her first interview this week in which she praised President Donald Trump </p>

<p>'I have been a supporter of President Trump since he announced he was running in the early days in 2015. I have watched from afar and I admire this man's resolve,' she revealed. </p>

<p>'He must be reelected … It's vital for the future of not only America, but western civilization as a whole.</p>

<p>'You look at all the terrorist attacks that have happened in Europe over the past 19 years. They have completely shaken us to the core … [Radical Islam] has completely infiltrated our society,' bin Ladin continued. </p>

<p>'In the US it's very worrying that the left has aligned itself completely with the people who share that ideology.'</p>

<p>She adds that she's not afraid to show her support for Trump in Europe despite the reaction it gets. </p>

<p>According to the 2018 Gallup poll, only 18 percent of Swiss citizens approved of his job performance but that doesn't stop her from wearing her MAGA hat to the grocery store. </p>

<p>'I am minding my own business and this woman in her late 50s charges toward me and starts speaking very loudly and aggressively to me,' she said of a recent confrontation at a store. </p>

<p>'She's yelling at me and saying how can I be wearing this and Trump is the worst president ever and she's basically dumping on my beloved president … She told me three times, "You're stupid". I kept my cool, and needless to say I kept my hat!' </p>

<p>Bin Ladin also has some harsh words for The Squad of liberal congresswomen, blasting them for dishonoring America when its 'an honor to be able and go live in the United States'. </p>

<p>'You do have a situation now in America where you have people like Ilhan Omar who actively hate your country,' she claimed. </p>

<p>'It's an honor to be able to go and live in the United States and make the most out of all the opportunities. If she hates it so much why doesn't she leave.' </p>

<p>Bin Ladin's world was torn apart when she was just 14 years old and her uncle Osama Bin Laden, pictured, carried out the 9/11 attack on her beloved United States</p>

<p>She also states that from her own experience, America is not a racist country and she rejects claims that it is. </p>

<p>'I have not had a single bad experience with Americans despite the name that I carry. On the contrary, I was overwhelmed by their kindness and understanding,' bin Ladin said. </p>

<p>One person bin Ladin is a fan of is rising GOP star Laura Loomer who is running for Congress in Florida.  </p>

<p>Loomer has previously been accused of Islamophobia in her comments but bin Ladin, who was raised with no religion, commends her for 'being brave enough and speaking out'. </p>

<p>She is also a fan of Fox Host Ticker Carlson and says that his nightly broadcast is her favorite TV show. </p>

<p>Bin Ladin and her two sisters Wafah and Najia were raised in Switzerland after their parents' divorce. </p>

<p>Noor bin Ladin's father Yeslam bin Ladin (pictured left) is an older half-brother of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden and her mother is Carmen Dufour, a Swiss author (pictured right)</p>

<p>Her father Yeslam bin Ladin is an older half-brother of terrorist leader Osama bin Laden and her mother is Carmen Dufour, a Swiss author. </p>

<p>She says her father has played no role in her life after a messy divorce from her mother in 1988. </p>

<p>Her mother released the book 'Inside the Kingdom: My Life in Saudi Arabia' in 2004, revealing what life was like inside the Bin Laden family. </p>
