<p>The UN's official Twitter account published part of a speech by Secretary General António Guterres, who was speaking on how the outbreak of Covid-19 has affected women. </p>

<p>The post has now drawn more than 13,000 responses - a significant proportion of which voice confusion, disagreement and bewilderment. </p>

<p>Mr Guterres was quoted as saying: 'The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls &amp; boys.'  </p>

<p>Mr Guterres was quoted as saying: 'The #COVID19 pandemic is demonstrating what we all know: millennia of patriarchy have resulted in a male-dominated world with a male-dominated culture which damages everyone – women, men, girls &amp; boys'</p>

<p>Social media users voiced their disagreement with the post, with some calling on the male UN chief to resign. Others called for the international body to be defunded.</p>

<p>Politics lecturer and author Adrian Hilton wrote to Mr Guterres saying: 'Since you are the ninth man to hold the position of UN Secretary-General since its creation, have you considered stepping aside in favour of a woman?'  </p>

<p>One Twitter user said: 'I honestly thought this was a parody account.' That tweet has gained more than 1,300 likes so far. </p>

<p>Mr Guterres' quote was from a speech given by Mr Guterres in late August, in which he said that Covid-19 was 'deepening existing inequalities, including gender inequality'. </p>

<p>Politics lecturer and author Adrian Hilton wrote to Mr Guterres saying: 'Since you are the ninth man to hold the position of UN Secretary-General since its creation, have you considered stepping aside in favour of a woman?'</p>

<p>One Twitter user said: 'I honestly thought this was a parody account.' That tweet has gained more than 1,300 likes so far</p>

<p>He adds: 'The past months have seen a growing recognition in the media and through academic research highlighting what we have known anecdotally for years: that women leaders are extremely effective. </p>

<p>'Women Heads of State, Ministers of Health, health workers and community leaders are winning widespread recognition for their empathy, compassion, communication and evidence-based decision-making.</p>

<p>'Their actions are showing the value of inclusivity. It stands to reason: doubling the resources, capacity and expertise we put into decision-making benefits everyone.'  </p>

<p>Mr Guterres had earlier this year warned of a 'horrifying global surge in domestic violence' as fear of the virus, along with its social and economic consequences, grew. </p>

<p>The UN chief, who appealed on March 23 for an immediate cease-fire in conflicts around the world to tackle the pandemic, said in a statement it is time to appeal for an end to all violence, 'everywhere, now.'   </p>

<p>In March he warned that coronavirus is the greatest global crisis since the Second World War and confronting it will bring a recession 'that has no parallel in the recent past'. </p>
