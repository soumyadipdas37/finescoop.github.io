<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bank of England has admitted to a string of failures which allowed a tech company to 'misuse' a secret audio feed of its press conferences.</p>

<p>It emerged last year that a firm called Statisma News was allowing its customers access to live-streamed Bank of England press conferences seconds before they were available to the rest of the market through the official video feeds.</p>

<p>This worried the Bank, since traders can potentially make millions of pounds by knowing what policy-makers have said before anyone else does.</p>

<p>Statisma News was allowing its customers access to live-streamed Bank of England press conferences seconds before they were available to the rest of the market</p>

<p>But while the Bank admitted it had made mistakes – including failing to investigate a warning from a whistle-blower in 2018 – the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) dropped its investigation into the affair.</p>

<p>The watchdog said: 'We do not believe the audio feed contained any inside information, nor have we found any activity of concern or misconduct.'</p>

<p>One source with knowledge of the matter branded the regulator 'toothless'.</p>

<p>Statisma had gained access to the secret streams through its affiliate company Encoded Media, which had been employed to video stream press conferences to the Bank's official Youtube channel.</p>

<p>An Encoded employee installed equipment which streamed an audio feed of what was said by officials. Because this was an audio-only feed, it was faster than the official video feeds.</p>

<p>Various companies connected to Encoded and Statisma then marketed expensive subscriptions to traders, claiming that they could offer a stream of the press conferences before anyone else.</p>

<p>The Bank said that it had not 'routinely monitored social media or the broader web for evidence of companies that advertise inappropriate access to the Bank's publications'.</p>

<p>It admitted, however, that a whistle-blower tried to warn it in 2018, but said the claim was 'not fully investigated' because officials didn't believe the allegations were possible. In a statement, the Bank said: 'There were occasions where, with the benefit of hindsight, this misuse by a third party supplier of the audio feed could have been identified sooner by the Bank.'</p>

<p>It added that responsibilities for streaming press conferences had not been clearly assigned to one department, which created the opportunity for more confusion.</p>

<p>Philip Wand, a director at Encoded, insisted his company had done nothing wrong. He said his firm had licensed the audio feed from Bloomberg, which runs the official video feed.</p>

<p>However, the Bank has now launched an overhaul of its contracting and risk assessment processes.</p>
