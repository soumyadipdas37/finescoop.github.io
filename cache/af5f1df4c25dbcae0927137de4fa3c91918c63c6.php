<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Peter Davidson will be joining the cast of Call the Midwife for the show's Christmas special later this year.</p>

<p>In a first look at his character, the former Doctor Who star, 69, transforms into Mr Percival, the Ringmaster of Percival's Circus, which is expected to attract a massive audience when it arrives in Poplar. </p>

<p>Filming for the upcoming series - which marks the tenth anniversary of the much-loved drama - resumed last month after production came to a halt in March due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>First look: Peter Davidson will be joining the cast of Call the Midwife as the Ringmaster of Percival's Circus (L) for the show's Christmas special (R as the fifth Doctor in 1981)</p>

<p>The festive edition will be set in December 1965, when Nonnatus House resident Sister Monica Joan (Judy Parfitt) is rushed to hospital, while Nurse Trixie Franklin (Helen George) grows angry as she receives a subscription to a Marriage Bureau. </p>

<p>Actor Peter's role as Mr Percival will see the midwives form new friendships and bring about a particularly interesting adventure for Nurse Phyllis Crane (Linda Bassett). </p>

<p>The screen star is best known for playing the fifth Doctor in BBC's Doctor Who between 1981 and 1984, before going on to appear on shows such as At Home with the Braithwaites and Law &amp; Order: UK. </p>

<p>Jenny Agutter, Fenella Woolgar, Ella Bruccoleri and Laura Main will also be returning to the show. </p>

<p>Exciting: The screen star (pictured in 2012), 69, is set to transform into Mr Percival with his circus, which is expected to attract a massive audience when it arrives in Poplar</p>

<p>Return: In August, bosses confirmed the series was up and running after being brought to halt by COVID-19 (L-R Leonie Elliott, Helen George, Linda Bassett and Jennifer Kirby pictured)</p>

<p>Taking to Facebook, executives gushed they were 'overjoyed' to be heading back to work to ensure their yearly special could air on time in December, along with snaps of a mask-clad Stephen McGann outside the iconic Nonnatus House. </p>

<p>In the images, Stephen - who plays Dr Turner in the series - can be seen having his makeup applied by a crew member, who is dressed head-to-toe in PPE. </p>

<p>A lengthy statement posted to the show's social media account said: 'This has been no mean achievement. Giving birth to each season of Call the Midwife, even in healthy times, is a major logistical task, involving the skills of far more people than you see on screen…</p>

<p>Back to business: Confirming its return, images of Stephen McGann - who plays Dr Turner in the series - having his makeup applied by a crew member were shared on Facebook</p>

<p>'Call the Midwife can have up to 200 crew members working on our set in a shooting day – and there are around 150 shooting days in every year. Our cast includes not only our 15 main cast members, but also about 70 guest actors in each season.'</p>

<p>'And babies? We reckon we've employed about 1,100 babies in total since our series began</p>

<p>'And let's not forget those other essential staff members who keep our Nonnatus House team fed and watered. Over 40,000 meals are served to our cast and crew during each filming season – as well as 100,000 cups of tea and coffee!</p>

<p>'Bringing all of these heroes back together to film in safety during a pandemic has been our top priority in these last months. But being able to deliver a brand new Christmas Special and Series 10 to you is the very best reward that we could wish for.' </p>

<p>Series Creator, Writer and Executive Producer Heidi Thomas added: 'Everyone is overjoyed to be whisking the dust sheets off Nonnatus House and getting back to filming after lockdown. </p>

<p>'It is a particular thrill to be able to deliver the Christmas Special on time, just as we promised at the start of the pandemic. </p>

<p>'We are very much a family at Call the Midwife, and like families everywhere, we have missed each other. We will now be putting more love and energy into our work than ever and can't wait to share Series 10 with our fantastic, loyal audience.'</p>

<p>Call The Midwife's Christmas Special will air on BBC One in December. Series 10 will begin in 2021.</p>

<p>'Overjoyed': In a statement, bosses shared their delight to be back to work and vowed fans would be seeing the nurses back in Poplar in the coming months</p>
