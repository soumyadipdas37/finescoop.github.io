<p>Jack visited the Crown Clinic in Manchester in January 2019 and in December of the same year to undergo the hair transplant and has now proudly flaunted the incredible results with his moved hairline and thicker volume.  </p>

<p>After undergoing the work, he has since shown the amazing results of his thickened thatch proving the work was very much a success.  </p>

<p>Last year, Jack made the surprise admission that hair loss made such an impact on his mental health that came close to giving up acting.</p>

<p>Wow! Jack's outing comes after he proudly showcased the impressive results of his hair transplant after his thinning locks put strain on his mental health</p>

<p>He wrote: '9 months it’s been since my hair transplant, I decided to get one as my hair was falling out and it was affecting my mental health to the point where I considered giving up acting and not being in the public eye. Thank you <?php echo e('@'); ?>drasimshahmalak <?php echo e('@'); ?>CrownClinicUK for everything.'</p>

<p>Jack had previously stated he was convinced to have a transplant after his hair loss became more noticeable on-screen.</p>

<p>He said at the time: 'I decided to have it done because my hair loss has really escalated in the last year, particularly at the front of my scalp. I remember seeing myself on screen and thinking: ''Oh my God, it is really falling out''.' </p>
