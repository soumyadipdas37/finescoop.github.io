<p>Cute! Hilaria Baldwin's Star Wars-loving son Leonardo Ángel 'produced' the latest photo of his newborn brother Eduardo 'Edu' Pao Lucas napping alongside a plush Baby Yoda doll</p>

<p>The force is strong with this one: Little Leo even dressed up in Chewbacca PJs to celebrate his fourth birthday with his family at home on Saturday</p>

<p>On Monday, the 36-year-old Mom Brain podcaster Instastoried two snaps of Leonardo and her seven-year-old daughter Carmen Gabriela bonding with the six-day-old baby.</p>

<p>'Edu has been a wonderful baby. I'm up with him every 2-3 hours at night. After he nurses he goes to sleep easily, all bundled up,' Hilaria wrote to her 813K Instagram followers.</p>

<p>'He has not been fussy-4.5 days in, he is living up to his name and is pretty peaceful...I breastfeed and I pump too store milk (I'll give you guys my pump routine later, in case it helps). The beginning of this journey is always full of love, but also tiredness and of course the physical pain of recovering.'</p>

<p>Baldwin (born Thomas) and her exhausted-looking husband Alec luckily have a nanny to help with their big bilingual brood, including five-year-old son Rafael Thomas and two-year-old son Romeo Alejandro.  </p>
