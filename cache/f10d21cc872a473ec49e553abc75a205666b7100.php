<p>The Tallahassee Police Department responded to more than a dozen calls about crowds over the weekend, including the 700-vehicle party on Dixie Drive just before midnight Saturday.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 revellers partied outside the Tenn Street Apartments in Tallahassee, two miles from Florida State University's campus, requiring police to use a helicopter to disperse the crowd.</p>

<p>Most of the travel lanes in the student apartment complex were blocked and TPD’s Patrol Bureau and the Leon County Sheriff’s Office helicopter broke up the party.</p>

<p>It comes after the university's president wrote to students telling them to social distance and avoid all gatherings last month. </p>

<p>The huge gatherings come as coronavirus cases among students at Florida State University have soared to more than 1,500 since testing began in August.</p>

<p>Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis denounced university crackdowns on parties and said he would seek a 'bill of rights' to protect students who could be expelled for partying.</p>

<p>Governor Ron DeSantis denounced university crackdowns on parties and said he would seek a 'bill of rights' to protect students who could be expelled for partying</p>

<p>He said: 'I understand that universities are trying to do the right thing but I personally think it's dramatically draconian that a student could get potentially expelled for going to a party.</p>

<p>'That’s what college kids do,' reported News4JAX.</p>

<p>DeSantis reiterated his stance that students are low-risk for the coronavirus and credited universities for not going 'overboard' in measures against students. </p>

<p>His comments came after FSU President John Thrasher appealed for students to wear masks and stay six feet apart, and avoid all parties and large gatherings.</p>

<p>Coronavirus cases among students at Florida State University have soared to nearly 1,500 since testing began in August</p>

<p>In a letter to students he wrote: 'The choices you make don't just impact you. </p>

<p>'They affect your friends, families, professors, FSU staff and the Tallahassee community at large, as well as our ability to hold in-person classes and future events and provide campus services,' reported CNN.</p>

<p>He added: 'Noncompliance with the expectations outlined in our Fall 2020 plan will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>'We must demonstrate our commitment to each other and this great university by doing everything we can to stop the spread of COVID-19,' reported Politico. </p>

<p>People party at the Elbo Room in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on Saturday after DeSantis reopened bars and restaurants to full capacity in the state on Friday</p>

<p>Florida reported its lowest coronavirus case rise since June on Monday, recording 738 new infections.</p>

<p>It takes the state's total to 701,302 cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began with at least 14,037 deaths.</p>

<p>DeSantis announced on Friday that effective immediately Florida moved to phase three of the coronavirus reopening plan with bars and restaurants at full capacity.</p>

<p>Dr Anthony Fauci openly criticised DeSantis's decision, describing it as 'very concerning' yesterday.</p>
