<p> Family is everything: Tristan has been living with Khloe and True since lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Calabasas</p>

<p>'So many people don't understand it, but I lead with love and we put our child first,' she told People in July. 'If you have that mindset, everything else follows easily. We have a family together.'</p>

<p>She added: 'Tristan and I needed that time to heal and I needed time to go through my emotions. But now he's literally one of my best friends.'</p>
