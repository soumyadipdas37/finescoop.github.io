<p>Explosive: Bond is known for his gadgets haul, and in keeping with 007's penchant for a gizmo, a new campaign to promote a smartphone has enlisted an MI6 agent - No Time To Die star Lashana Lynch</p>

<p>The explosive photos feature Lashana in one of her costumes from the film, with all the 007 trimmings, including an Aston Martin DBS Superleggera and a Triumph Thruxton RS motorcycle.</p>

<p>And in keeping with the film franchise's love of gadgets, a number of photos were taken on the Nokia 8.3 5G smartphone.</p>

<p>Lashana said: 'The world we live in now means we all have the ultimate gadget in our pockets.</p>

<p>'It's amazing what smartphones can do nowadays. I'm excited to be unveiling this new smartphone to celebrate the release of 'No Time To Die' in November, and the Nokia 8.3 5G is proof that Bond gadgets are always ahead of the game.'</p>

<p>Star: Lashana, who stars in the upcoming Bond movie No Time To Die alongside 007 himself Daniel Craig, features in striking new images for the Nokia 8.3 5G smartphone</p>

<p>The images were taken by celebrity social media 'phone-ographer' Ben Maclean, who at one point found himself suspended 30 feet in the air on a rig to capture the action-packed images. </p>

<p>The 25th film in the franchise finds Bond after he has left active service and is enjoying a tranquil life in Jamaica when his old friend Felix Leiter, played by Jeffrey Wright, from the CIA turns up asking for help. </p>

<p>Leaving his seemingly happy live with Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), Bond returns to the field to face Safin who is armed with a new dangerous technology that could impact the world.   </p>

<p>Action-packed: The actress, who plays new female 00 agent Nomi in Cary Joji Fukunaga's Bond movie, was back at Pinewood studios for the shoot, shot on the new phone which serves as official phone partner for the 25th Bond movie</p>

<p>In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.</p>

<p>The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change.</p>

<p>The upcoming movie will mark Daniel's last-ever outing as the iconic character, which the actor recently insisted he was 'fine' about.   </p>

<p>Bond in the making: The explosive photos feature Lashana in one of her costumes from the film, with all the 007 trimmings, including an Aston Martin DBS Superleggera and a Triumph Thruxton RS motorcycle</p>

<p>Action! The images were taken by celebrity social media 'phone-ographer' Ben Maclean, who at one point found himself suspended 30 feet in the air</p>

<p>Lashana and her co-star Ana de Armas detailed their experiences with modernising the Bond film in a #MeToo era in an interview earlier this year.</p>

<p>The actors described how the new film's 'Bond girls' will go against the stereotypical 'sexualised' heroine, and described working with the much-praised co-writer of the film, Phoebe Waller-Bridge. </p>

<p>On the film being fronted by Lashana - who is of Jamaican heritage - War Dogs actress Ana said of her co-star: 'It's pretty obvious that there is an evolution in the fact that Lashana is one of the main characters in the film and wears the pants — literally.'</p>

<p>Meeting his match: The 25th film in the franchise finds Bond after he has left active service with Lashana starring as a female 00 agent</p>

<p>Lashana enthused the production team took her preferences for her character Nomi on board, and has described the next 007 as someone 'who was rough around the edges' and has tackled both relationship and body image issues - in a bid to make her portrayal more relatable to the average viewer.</p>

<p>As part of The Hollywood Reporter's Next Gen Talent list, the Still Star-Crossed actress told the publication: 'You're given a fresh perspective on a brand-new black woman in the Bond world.' </p>

<p>When news of Lashana taking over the code name 007 from Daniel Craig first emerged, the reports were met with mixed reviews, with former Bond girl Trina Parks even claiming the iconic code name was meant for a man. </p>

<p>On the backlash, the media personality defiantly said: 'It doesn't dishearten me. It makes me feel quite sad for some people because their opinions are from a sad place. People are reacting to an idea, which has nothing to do with my life.' </p>

<p>Exciting: Daniel Craig looked suave as he transformed into James Bond and went after enemies in an action-packed new poster for No Time To Die, which was released last week</p>
