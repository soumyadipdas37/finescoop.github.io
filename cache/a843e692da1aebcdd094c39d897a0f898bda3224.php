<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The amount to time you are exposed to coronavirus may partially dictate how likely you are to catch the potentially deadly virus, a new study suggests. </p>

<p>Researchers at the University of Colorado at Boulder (CU) re-examined a now-infamous Washington state choir practice, in which one person with coronavirus unwittingly spread the virus to 52 others. </p>

<p>They determined that the virus was primarily transmitted between the singers via aerosols - very fine drops of spit and mucus sprayed into the air while we breathe, talk and sing. </p>

<p>And the ability for the singers to be infected by these tiny floating aerosols was compounded by the amount of time - two-and-a-half hours - that 60 people spent in close quarters with one infected person. </p>

<p>The CU Boulder team estimates that if the choir practice had been shorter, it also would have been safer. </p>

<p>CU Boulder experts suggest that coronavirus might only have spread from one person to 12% of a choir practice in Washington state if the rehearsal were just half an hour. Instead, the virus spread to 53 out of 61 attendees, becoming a superspreading event (file) </p>

<p>Of the 61 total people at the Skagit County, Washington, choir practice, the virus spread from one person to 87 percent of the others attendees. </p>

<p>Only eight people were spared infection. </p>

<p>Two of those who were confirmed to have COVID-19 died. </p>

<p>The practice was dubbed a tragic 'superspreading' event, but the reasons it might have been one are complex, and had not been broken down at the most granular level. </p>

<p>In an effort to work out why the virus spread with such speed and attacked choir practice attendees at such a high rate, the CU Boulder team modelled spreading scenarios based on three 'influential factors': ventilation rate, duration of event and deposition onto surfaces,' the wrote. </p>

<p>A fourth key factor was conspicuously absent at the choir practice: no one wore masks, which are now widely accepted to block some percentage of the large droplets that are the main vehicle by which the virus spreads.  </p>

<p>Coronavirus can survive for some time on surfaces, but this is not a primary mode of transmission, according to both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). </p>

<p>For a practice that went for 2.5 hours (solid black line), the odds of getting infected if there was virtually no ventilation, were greater than 90%, a graph from the study shows. A half-hour practice (longest dashed line, bottom), the chance of infection would only have been about 10%, even with next-to-no ventilation </p>

<p>The singers' breathing also determined how much virus air and thus virus they emitted, with the average emission rate being shown by the solid black line </p>

<p>The singers did share snacks, but they reported diligent hand hygiene and made sure to disinfect surfaces, according to the study, accepted for publication in the journal Indoor Air. </p>

<p>But the room they were in for over two hours was poorly ventilated, meaning air containing infectious particles was not cycled out very frequently. </p>

<p>What's more, singing itself 'is known to release high amounts of aerosol,' said lead study author Dr Shelly Miller. </p>

<p>'This study documents in great detail that the only plausible explanation for this superspreading event was transmission by aerosols. </p>

<p>'Shared air is important because you can be inhaling what someone else exhaled even if they are far away from you.' </p>

<p>A growing body of research suggests that coronavirus can spread in these fine, far-ranging particles.</p>

<p>Monday, the CDC posted guidance alerting the public of this mode of transmission - which the WHO refused to recognize - only to removed the guidance and issue a statement that it had been posted 'in error. </p>

<p>It's unclear exactly how close together the singers were standing. A CDC report suggests some were less than a foot apart. The new study cites answers from a choir spokesperson suggesting that most were about four feet away from the next singer, in a large, but poorly ventilated church sanctuary. </p>

<p>The heat and force of singing itself may also have propelled coronavirus aerosols around the room, causing the air to mix and move. </p>

<p>And the longer the practice attendees stayed in the room, the more highly-concentrated the stagnant air became with particles of coronavirus from the one infected person. </p>

<p>The CU Boulder team's models suggest that cutting the duration of the practice to half an hour might have reduced the 'attack rate' - the number of people infected by the index case - by more than 86 percent.  </p>

<p>Exposure duration has gotten less attention than closeness of contact, but a similar theory has been posed to explain (in part) the higher rates and greater severity of infection among minority Americans. </p>

<p>Black and Hispanic people in the US represent a disproportionately high share of those who work 'essential' jobs that required them to continue going to work day after day, often on public transit. They also represent a disproportionate share of coronavirus cases. </p>

<p>In addition to higher rates of underlying conditions that put them at risk for severe COVID-19 and poorer access to health care, these people are also more likely to have more intense exposures to coronavirus. </p>

<p>It's not so much that a single encounter puts them at risk for contracting coronavirus, but the repeated contact means they take on greater viral loads. </p>

<p>Similarly, as the 2.5 hour choir practice dragged on, the viral particles emitted by the sick person collected in the air, steeping the other singers in them.   </p>
