<p>Tatt's outrageous! The Bachelor's Bella Varelis showed off her very intimate tattoo while stripping down to a bikini at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Saturday</p>

<p>A beaming Bella was joined by her friend and co-star Bec Cvilikas, who joined the series as a post-lockdown intruder last week.</p>

<p>Her bikini line tattoo is an outline of a love heart. She also sports a less risqué tattoo consisting of cursive writing on her forearm.</p>

<p>The Instagram influencer flaunted her toned and tanned physique in her revealing two-piece, which featured a pair of G-string bottoms.</p>

<p>Bella was seen chatting with Bec as the two women soaked up the sun. Later on, she chatted to her stepfather.</p>

<p>The sighting comes as Bella finds herself at the centre of drama on the show.</p>

<p>The marketing consultant accused her rival Irena Srbinovska of 'manipulated her way through the show' during Wednesday's episode.</p>

<p>Fans flocked to Twitter to criticise her behaviour and labelled her a 'hypocrite'.  </p>

<p>Taking the plunge! Bella went for a dip in the ocean during her trip to the beach</p>

<p>'I think [Irena] has a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella told the other women.</p>

<p>'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it.'</p>

<p>'And she's doing exactly that!' she added, breaking down in tears.</p>

<p>Viewers later hit out at Bella, accusing her of being the manipulative one.</p>

<p>'If anyone's manipulating Locky now it's you Bella,' one person wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Bella has made one mistake that gets people sent home... b**chin about another person in the house!! Bye bye Bella, you used to be my favourite,' another said.</p>

<p>A third tweeted: 'Has Bella never seen The Bachelor because this always happens and never ends well?'</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Done: Bella and Bec (left) were later seen packing up their belongings and heading home</p>
