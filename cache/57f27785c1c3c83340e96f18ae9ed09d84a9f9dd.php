<p>Fans on social media seemed baffled by the sudden casting change, with one writing, 'What happened to Noah??? Did I miss something?'</p>

<p>Some were outraged by the decision, with one user tweeting at the TV network: 'you’re such a hypocrite. You’ve fired him for gay porn past but allow people on island to have sex? Homophobia at finest!'</p>

<p>Another wrote, 'If the show kicked Noah out because of his porn past then Imma be p***ed. Even though I don't know him and don't really care about him. Sex work is still work.'</p>

<p>A spin-off of a British reality series, Love Island airs on CBS five nights a week.</p>
