<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Breast milk may help protect babies from being infected by the novel coronavirus, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>Researchers at a lab in China found that mother's milk prevented the pathogen from infecting and replicating in cells, even if the child does not have antibodies.</p>

<p>What's more, it was shown to be even more effective than the milk of other animals such as goats and cows.</p>

<p>The team, from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, says the findings support the recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 be encouraged to continue breastfeeding. </p>

<p>In a new study from Beijing University of Chemical Technology, researchers mixed healthy cells into human breast milk and then exposed them to the coronavirus (file image)</p>

<p>For the study, published on pre-peer review site bioRxiv.org, the team exposed human lung and gut cells to SARS-CoV-2.</p>

<p>Next, they analyzed what effect breast milk, which was collected in 2017 - before the pandemic - had on the cells. </p>

<p>Healthy cells were mixed into human breast milk. Then the milk was washed off and the cells were exposed to the virus.</p>

<p>The virus did not bind to or enter most of the cells. Additionally, if it did enter cells, the virus was not able to make copies of itself.    </p>

<p>The virus did not bind to or enter most of the cells and, if it did enter cells, it was not able to replicate itself (above)</p>

<p>This suggests breast milk can inhibit the coronavirus as it does other viruses such as norovirus and bacteria. </p>

<p>'SARS-CoV-2 could infect [cells] and the infection could be inhibited by breastmilk (2 mg/ml) , which was reported to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity,' the authors wrote. </p>

<p>In a previous study, the same research team found breast milk prevented coronavirus infection in animal kidney cells.</p>

<p>They determined the whey protein, which has anti-inflammatory properties, was responsible for inactivating the virus rather than other proteins such as lactoferrin.</p>

<p>'Whey protein from human breastmilk effectively inhibited...SARS-CoV-2...by blocking viral attachment, entry and even post-entry viral replication,' they wrote.</p>

<p>This was also true when milk was tested from those of others animals included cows and goats. </p>

<p>However, the whey from animals suppressed the viral strains by approximately 70 percent compared to the nearly 100 percent of human whey.</p>

<p>A national study is currently being launched by Washington State University to determine whether or not babies can contract coronavirus from breastfeeding.</p>

<p>Limited research has been conducted on this topic up to this point, but the results have been mixed.</p>

<p>Some studies have found no virus in human milk while others have detected viral RNA in just certain milk samples.</p>

<p>For example, at least two studies, one from China and another from the US, found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 in human breastmilk.</p>

<p>But a report from the WHO found that, of 46 breast milk samples from mothers with the virus, 43 came came back negative while three tested positive for particles.</p>

<p>However, the team says that even if viral genetic material is found in breastmilk, it doesn't mean it's infectious or can be spread to babies. </p>
