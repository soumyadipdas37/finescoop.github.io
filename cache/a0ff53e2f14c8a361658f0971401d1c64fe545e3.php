<p>Gabrielle covered a range of topics on Naomi Campbell's latest web series, No Filter, including Union's exit from America's Got Talent earlier this year and the ensuing investigation surrounding her departure. </p>

<p>Gabrielle was fired from the NBC program for speaking out on racial insensitivity and working in a toxic culture. </p>

<p>She told Naomi that looking back on her career in Hollywood thus far, she's struck by 'the anti-blackness of it all,' which she called 'jarring and shocking, and it still is.</p>

<p>'There's a very narrow idea of what kind of black girl was acceptable and marketable.'</p>
