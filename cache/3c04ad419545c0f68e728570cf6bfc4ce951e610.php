<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>We are a seafaring country, but we haven't been able to spend much time on the water of late. Ocean cruises have been 'paused' on government advice and there's not a lot of river cruising going on in Europe.</p>

<p>However, here in the UK, the loosening of restrictions for tourist craft means boating firms can squeeze in late-season departures along Britain's coast and inland waterways. So why not book yourself on a small boat trip as far afield as Scotland's rugged Hebrides, or delve into the nooks and crannies of the West Country coastline? Alternatively, you can pootle along rivers and canals through the countryside.</p>

<p>To comply with regulations permitting only two households on overnight stays in England — and the new 'rule of six' — charters are aimed at family groups making up one household, with the boat crew counting as the other. Here is a selection of ways you can take to Britain's waters this autumn...</p>

<p>West Country wanderings</p>

<p>The Bessie Ellen - one of Britain's last wooden coasting ketches, which departs from Fowey and under normal circumstances takes up to eight passengers</p>

<p>On the Bessie Ellen, pictured, you can explore deserted coves and beaches along the coast of Devon and Cornwall</p>

<p>Discover the hidden face of the West Country on a 'Boat Bubble Holiday'. Climb aboard classic and heritage sailing craft and explore deserted coves and beaches along the coast of Devon and Cornwall.</p>

<p>Choose from the 100ft Bessie Ellen, one of Britain's last wooden coasting ketches which departs from Fowey and under normal circumstances takes up to eight passengers; Agnes, a 46 ft wooden pilot cutter accommodating up to six, based in Falmouth; and Lynher, a classic Tamar barge that sails from Plymouth and takes up to six people. Each craft comes with its own crew who take care of the sailing (though guests are welcome to lend a hand) and rustle up three meals a day plus drinks.</p>

<p>Explore fishing villages and beauty spots, some only accessible by water, with swimming stops and beach barbecues along the way.</p>

<p>STEP ABOARD: VentureSail Holidays (venturesailholidays.com) offers sailings of between three and six nights with prices from £130 pp per night, including meals, soft drinks and use of onboard water 'toys', such as kayaks and dinghies.</p>
