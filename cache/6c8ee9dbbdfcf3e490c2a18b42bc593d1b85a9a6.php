<p>The teenager has already established himself as a star, becoming the youngest ever Champions League goalscorer and the youngest ever Barcelona goalscorer.</p>

<p>However, the new Catalans boss has called for 'calm' over the youngsters development as he insists the striker still needs to improve aspects of his game despite being set for a star studded career.   </p>

<p> Ronald Koeman expects Ansu Fati to play an important role in Barcelona's first team this year</p>

<p>Having helped Barcelona put their torturous summer behind them by providing two goals in 18 minutes in their 4-0 thrashing of Villarreal, Koeman spoke fondly of Fati in the post-match conference. </p>

<p>'Ansu is a young player, and we are still seeking consistency in his performances,' the Dutch manager said. </p>

<p>'He has a great future and I am happy with his performance against Villarreal.</p>

<p>'His progress has been enormous, and we have benefited from that. He keeps proving his worth and we are confident he will keeping developing.'</p>

<p>Koeman, who won his first game in charge, praised Fati for his performance against Villarreal</p>

<p>The 17-year-old Spain international scored twice to fire Barcelona to victory against Villarreal </p>

<p>Fati will take Barcelona's number 22 shirt this season and look to help the club bring the La Liga crown back to Catalunya once again.</p>

<p>Following Diego Costa and Luis Suarez's exit to Atletico Madrid, Fati will be handed more regular first-team opportunities under Koeman this year.</p>

<p>The youngster is likely to rotate with Ousmane Dembele as he looks to develop a partnership with Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann. </p>

<p>Following Luis Suarez's exit to Atletico Madrid, Fati will be given regular first-team chances</p>

<p>Fati will look to build a formidable partnership with Barcelona star Lionel Messi this season</p>

<p>Barcelona have previously been criticised for their reluctance to give the youngster generation a chance but Fati is one of a select few to handed an opportunity. </p>

<p>The youngster is, however, yet to sign a first-team deal with the club. </p>

<p>As it stands, the 17-year-old is contracted with the Catalans until June 30, 2022 and has a release clause worth £153million.</p>

<p>That clause will be increased to £363m when he signs a professional contract with the club.  </p>

<p>Koeman’s side now face back to back La Liga games ahead of the October international break with a midweek trip to Celta Vigo and a home game against Sevilla.</p>
