<p>On blast: Just days after getting evicted from Big Brother All-Stars, Janelle Pierzina put one of her former houseguests Nicole Franzel on blast</p>

<p>'Just received my invite. 3k for hotel so Nicole’s reception and hotel stay can basically be comped,' Pierzina began.</p>

<p>'Glad I don’t have to go. I hate cheap a** weddings where the go to song is Cotton Eyed Joe,' she concluded.</p>

<p>During her goodbye message, Franzel's relationship with Pierzina had clearly strained during their time in the Big Brother house.</p>

<p>Goodbye: During her goodbye message, Franzel's relationship with Pierzina had clearly strained during their time in the Big Brother house</p>

<p>'I thought we were really good friends outside of here and quickly I realized that wasn’t the case. I know you probably don’t want to come to my wedding, so just don’t worry about it,' Nicole said in her goodbye message.</p>

<p>Franzel has not yet responded to Pierzina's tweet, where she showcased Franzel's invite, that was designed like a passport, along with the RSVP card.</p>

<p>Franzel is tying the knot with Victor Arroyo, who was a houseguest with her on Big Brother 18, which Franzel won.  </p>

<p>Dani also explained that, 'Charging 3K to attend the wedding is a tacky way of getting your guests to foot the bill.</p>

<p>She added in another tweet that the 3K is just for a 'three night stay' and 'airfare is extra.'</p>

<p>The tweet also got the attention of Bachelor Nation star Demi Burnett, who said, 'I'm Screaming who pays 3k to go to a wedding... wait I would pay 3k to go to your wedding Janie.' </p>

<p>Franzel was eliminated by a vote of 9-2 on last Thursday's episode of Big Brother, with Dani Briones and Enzo Palumbo throwing 'hinky' votes for Janelle just to stir things up in the house.</p>

<p>Franzel threw some shade Dani's way as well, in an interview with US Weekly after her eviction.</p>

<p>'I absolutely did want to work with Danielle initially. But she was so cemented in that alliance and I have Kaysar that I have to protect, so it was like, ‘How is this going to work out?" Janelle began.</p>

<p>'She’s with the people that would target me and Kaysar. But if things were different and I didn’t have Kaysar, I would absolutely try to get in that alliance, obviously, day one,' she added.</p>

<p>Janelle then raised eyebrows by insinuating that she would 'let' Dani win the game after her eviction.</p>

<p>'I thought about throwing Danielle and Nicole Franzel's game out the window, and blowing up my relationship with Danielle outside of the house. But I figured, I’m not going to do that. Let Danielle win,' she said.</p>

<p>'If Danielle wins the game, I’d feel extremely happy for her. Career-wise, she doesn’t have a lot going on and she probably really needs the money. So I was like, "I’m not going to do that to Dani"' she added.</p>

<p>Big Brother All-Stars returns Wednesday night at 8 PM ET on CBS. </p>
