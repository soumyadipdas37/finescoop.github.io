<p>Emotional: Florence Pugh took to Instagram on Thursday to pay tribute to the late Broadway star Nick Cordero on what would have been his 42nd birthday</p>

<p>'So. This amazing man is turning 42 today. Nick was the first to welcome me into this friendship group, he had this big open smile that makes you fall in love with him even if he hadn't said anything yet,' Pugh, 24, began with glowing affection in her lengthy statement.</p>

<p>'Nick used to let me put ointments and beard balms and face masks on him after dinner when everyone else at the dinner table had politely refused.'</p>

<p>She went on to gush about how the Canadian born actor and singer would alway eat all of her cooking, 'everything even if it was burnt' and then go back for more.</p>

<p>'He’d then go back for seconds, thirds, fourths.. each time mmm’ing and ah’ing with the same intensity as the first time,' the British born actress explained before turning her praise to his mighty talents as a vocalist. </p>

<p>'Nick sings like it's as easy as breathing. His voice is like butter and if you ever had the pleasure of hearing it live you’d be so wrapped up in the song you wouldn't have time to notice the goosebumps all over your skin.'   </p>

<p>Tribute: The British born actress, 24, heaped praise on Cordero, who passed away on July 5 from COVID-19 complications </p>

<p>Fond memories: The Little Women star referenced Cordero's open smile 'that makes you fall in love with him even if he hadn't said anything yet'</p>

<p>Cherish the moments: Pugh got to spend quality time with Cordero, in part, because of her boyfriend Zach Braff's close friendship over the years</p>

<p>Pugh had spent some quality time with Cordero and his wife due to Braff's close friendship with Cordero over the years. </p>

<p>She also raved about how her mother, Deborah Pugh, also loved spending time with the Bullets Over Broadway star, by referencing one particular night they all shared together.</p>

<p>'My mum fell in love with him. She spent a whole dinner planted between Amanda and Nick, her gaze would jump between the two of them, almost like she was wrapped up in the middle of their love just admiring it,' the actress wrote.</p>

<p>'My mum was so in love with him that she forgot to eat dessert.. which.. for our family, is a big f***ing deal.' </p>

<p>Infectious personality: Pugh said her mother, Deborah Pugh, loved spending time with the Bullets Over Broadway star: Cordero and Kloots are pictured with Pugh's mother Deborah</p>

<p>Acclaimed: The Canadian native was best known for his roles on Broadway that included Bullets Over Broadway, The Waitress and A Bronx Tale</p>

<p>Another tribute: Pugh also shared a photo of herself planting a kiss on the cheek of Kloots, while heaping praise on her for her courage during these last seven months</p>

<p>Pugh then went into detail about Cordero's infectious personality and physicality.  </p>

<p>'Nick was the best cuddler. He was so big and so mighty he would wonderfully smother you and wouldn't let go. I would find Zach and Nick cuddling on the sofa at the end of so many parties, it looked so comfortable it would be hard not to join. It's hard to imagine someone so big and so mighty is no longer here anymore,' she added. </p>

<p>'Nick had so much love. He had so much love to give it was impossible not to feel high whenever you’d leave him.'</p>

<p>She ended the emotional post with: 'Happy F***king Birthday darling, we shall have a mighty cheese board with all the chutneys and relishes in your honour. We're thinking of you. ‘We love you to infinity and beyond!"'</p>

<p>Kloots was quick to comment on the post by sharing: 'Love this and you. He loved you so much Flo'.</p>

<p>In a separate post, Pugh also shared a photo of herself planting a kiss on the cheek of Kloots.</p>

<p>'And to this incredible woman. We love you to infinity and beyond. Thank you for being the strongest woman any of us have ever had the privilege and the pleasure of watching these last 7 months. You are our warrior. Happy birthday to your Nick. <?php echo e('@'); ?>amandakloots' </p>

Elvis and I will be singing here on earth to you,' she captioned a couple of photos and a video from his 41st birthday celebration.</p>
