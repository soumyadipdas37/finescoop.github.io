<p>'I'm making this move and exploring this new way of communication to me because, as we all know, the world is in trouble.</p>

<p>'Continents are on fire, glaciers are melting, coral reefs are dying, fish are disappearing from our oceans, the list goes on and on.</p>

<p>'But we know what to do about it, that's why I'm tackling this new way for me of communication.</p>

<p>Sir David Attenborough, pictured, issued a warning about climate change ahead of the release of his forthcoming Netflix film A Life On Our Planet</p>

<p>'Over the next few weeks I'll be recording messages to explain what the problems are and how we can deal with them.</p>

<p>'Join me or, as we used to say in those early days of radio, stay tuned.'</p>

<p>More videos explaining climate change problems and how humanity can join together to combat them are set to be shared in coming weeks. </p>

<p>Filmmakers Colin Butfield and Jonnie Hughes will be posting his video messages on the social media platform for him.</p>

<p>Alongside the clip, they posted: 'David Attenborough has spent a lifetime travelling, exploring the wild places of our planet and documenting the living world in all its variety and wonder. </p>

<p>'He’s also witnessed the damaged caused. Saving our planet is now a communications challenge. We know what to do, we just need the will.</p>

<p>'That’s why we want to share this message on Instagram. Because there is hope and together, we can inspire change.</p>

<p> 'Social media isn't David's usual habitat so while he's recorded messages solely for Instagram, like the one in this post, we're helping to run this account.' </p>

<p>His launch on Instagram was praised by stars including tennis player Andy Murray, who commented: 'Welcome to Instagram Sir David!'</p>
