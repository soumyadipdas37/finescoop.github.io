<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Bachelor Matt Agnew has embraced a more relaxed approach to personal grooming during lockdown in Melbourne. </p>

<p>And on Sunday, the 33-year-old unveiled his latest transformation.  </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Matt showed himself in an Adidas tracksuit along with a Tamagotchi round his neck, reminiscent of 1990s Japanese street style.</p>

<p>'I'm a cool dad': Former Bachelor Matt Agnew, 33, (pictured) wore an Adidas tracksuit and a Tamagotchi round his neck for a photo shoot on Sunday </p>

<p>As a sign of the times, Matt wore a black face mask. He also wore a beanie and pristine white lace-up sneakers.   </p>

<p>'I'm not like a regular tamagotchi dad. I'm a cool tamagotchi dad,' Matt wrote under the post, appearing to reference the 2004 film, Mean Girls.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Matt shocked fans with his new look with the usually clean-shaven reality star sporting a five o'clock shadow in a selfie shared to Instagram. </p>

<p>Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for not recognising Matt without his signature 'geeky' glasses, clean-cut look and sharp tuxedo.  </p>

<p>The data scientist nonetheless looked handsome with stubble and a grey beanie as he drew attention to a worthwhile cause. </p>

<p>Matt's followers remarked on his changing appearance in the comments section of another recent Instagram photo.  </p>

<p>Dreamy: Matt sported a more familiar look in this photo shared just a few weeks ago</p>

<p>'Gezzzz, you have changed. You don't look the same,' one wrote, while another added: 'You look different today.' </p>

<p>However, those familiar with Matt's journey over the past few years will know that he has always preferred a more laid-back style.</p>

<p>He liked to keep things casual during his pre-Bachelor days as a university academic, with photos from that period showing him looking quite ordinary compared to the Mills &amp; Boon-esque leading man he was portrayed as on TV.  </p>

<p>Matt chose 28-year-old chemical engineer Chelsie McLeod as his winner on The Bachelor last year, but their relationship didn't last.</p>

<p>The couple confirmed their split two months after the finale air date, and Chelsie later hinted it wasn't her decision to end things.</p>

<p>One of Matt's contestants, Elly Miles, is the new Bachelorette. She will be joined on her journey by her sister, Becky.</p>
