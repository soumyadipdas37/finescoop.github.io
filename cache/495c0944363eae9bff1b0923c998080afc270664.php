<p>33 weeks ♡</p>

<p>A post shared by  Gigi Hadid (<?php echo e('@'); ?>gigihadid) on Aug 31, 2020 at 7:52am PDT</p>

<p>The expecting model's little girl should be coming very soon.</p>

<p>At the end of August the elder Hadid revealed a series of stunning Vogue portraits where she gazed directly at the camera while cradling her third-trimester bump.</p>

<p>One of the photos was captioned '33 weeks,' meaning Gigi and on/off boyfriend of five-years Zayn Malik are on the last leg of the pregnancy.</p>

<p>The exact timeline is a bit unclear, however, as it's not known if Hadid meant she was 33 weeks along at the time of posting or when the photos were taken in July.</p>

<p>If she was counting down from July that would put the star at 40-weeks any day now.</p>

<p>Gigi confirmed her pregnancy in April, after 'family sources' first revealed the news.</p>

<p>Timeline: At the end of August Gigi captioned a stunning Vogue photoshooting saying she was '33 weeks,' meaning the due date could be any day now</p>

<p>She said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. </p>

<p>'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.'</p>

<p>However, the celeb remained tight-lipped about the pregnancy, saying she thinks it's 'not the most important thing going on in the world.'</p>

<p>Hadid added: 'That's a reason that I felt that it's not really something that I need to share apart from with my family and friends.</p>

<p>'Obviously a lot of people have lost lives due to [the] coronavirus that was in the beginning of quarantine and still happening,' she said.</p>

<p>'And then we moved obviously into the reemergence of the BLM [Black Lives Matter] movement, and I thought that our presence on social media should be used for that.'</p>
