<p>And while the 39-year-old has worked hard to deal with the mental anguish that came after the incident, his mates haven't made the healing process easy.  </p>

<p>Speaking to The Kyle And Jackie O show on Thursday, Mick admitted his surfing buddies sometimes prank him by pretending there's a shark in the water</p>

<p>'I freak out': Surfer Mick Fanning, 39, has admitted his friends sometimes mock him at the beach by splashing behind him and shouting, 'Shark! Shark!' - even though he's battling PTSD after his 2015 shark attack  </p>

<p>'It still took me about a year or so to get through my PTSD. Even still, I'm very wary of what's in the ocean. People splash behind me, I freak out. My mate do it to me all the time,' he explained.  </p>

<p>Shocked, Kyle Sandilands queried: 'Does anyone ever yell 'Shark! Shark!' when you're out there? And do you think, 'Listen, don't do that'? </p>

<p>'Yeah there's a few here that do that,' Mick replied dryly. </p>

<p>'I had to go through and deal with things in my own personal life': Earlier in the interview, Mick spoke about the long healing process following the shark attack, admitting it took him 'a year or so' to get through his post-traumatic stress disorder</p>

<p>'[After the shark attack] I had to go through and deal with things in my own personal life to make sure I was in a spot where I was comfortable with going surfing again,' he explained.    </p>

<p>It comes after Mick explained to The Australian why he still 'freaks' out whenever somebody splashes behind him in the water.  </p>

<p>Terrifying: Mick was four minutes into the JBay Open surf event in South Africa when a six-metre shark circled him. Pictured: Mick being attacked by a shark during the JBay Open in Jeffreys Bay, July 19, 2015 </p>

<p>'I mean, it's like I'm in the actual position I was in, it's a reality dream,' the three-times world champion said.</p>

<p>'You sort of learn your body can do so many things to make things real and not real and I just had to learn, 'OK, that moment's been done. It's not real. These dreams are just coming back'.'  </p>

<p>'I thought I was going to die. I guess everyone watching on from the beach that day, and on the live broadcast all over the world, thought the exact same thing,' he told  Stellar in April 2019. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mick is hot on the promotions trail for his new National Geographic documentary Save This Shark on September 15. </p>

<p>The two-part series follows Mick as he conquers his fear of the animal by exploring  shark conservation and new technologies helping humans and sharks safely co-exist. </p>

<p>'It was a really personal journey for me to be able to reconnect with sharks in this way,' Mick said in a statement. </p>
