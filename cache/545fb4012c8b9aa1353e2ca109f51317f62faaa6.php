<p>Two-year-old Yegor died without regaining consciousness after a desperate 10-day fight for his life in a Ukrainian hospital.</p>

<p>The child's heart stopped beating one day after doctors reported a slight improvement in his condition. </p>

<p>He had been on a ventilator and kidney dialysis and his condition remained critical during the 10 agonising days.</p>

<p>Yegor, two, in hospital where he died after an agonising 10-day fight for his life following an attack by dogs who ripped off his genitals </p>

<p>The tragedy unfolded in the small town of Selydove, eastern Ukraine, on September 18 – as the family were celebrating the boy's second birthday.</p>

<p>Reports say the toddler walked outside unnoticed while his parents were sitting at a table with their guests.</p>

<p>It is understood that Yegor was wandering around the courtyard when two German Shepherd guard dogs broke out of their enclosure and attacked him.</p>

<p>Noticing the child's absence, the parents went to search for him.</p>

<p>Charity volunteer Aleksandra Timoshchenkova, who helped the family to collect money for Yegor's treatment said: 'The boy was found lying unconscious in a pool of blood.</p>

<p>'The dogs were still tearing him apart.'</p>

<p>According to reports, the dogs managed to break out of their enclosure because Yegor's father had failed to close its door properly.</p>

<p>Yegor was transported by a military helicopter to the city of Dnipro to receive the medical care he needed</p>

<p>Medics attend to Yegor, spending five hours restoring his damaged blood vessels, bladder and intestines. They also removed tissues 'that had been chewed by the dogs'</p>

<p>During the attack, they ripped off the boy's genitals, anus and tore the femoral artery on his left leg, say local media.</p>

<p>Because of the severity of his injuries, Yegor was transported by a military helicopter to the city of Dnipro to receive the medical care he needed.</p>

<p>The boy was admitted to Dnipro Regional Children's Hospital where four crews of surgeons started battling for his life.</p>

<p>It took medics five hours to restore his damaged blood vessels, bladder and intestines. They also removed tissues 'that had been chewed by the dogs'.</p>

<p>Natalia Dementyeva, the head of the hospital commented: 'The boy suffered extremely severe injuries known as dirty wounds.'</p>

<p>Police launched a criminal case for failure to fulfil parental duties resulted in severe consequences against Yegor's mother and father.</p>

<p>The parents face up to three years in prison if found guilty.</p>

<p>The investigation continues. </p>
