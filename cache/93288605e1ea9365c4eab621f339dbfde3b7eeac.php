<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago Silva remains driven by the desire to win trophies even at 35 and has set his sights on Premier League glory at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The Brazilian centre-back is poised to make his debut for Frank Lampard's side having joined from Paris Saint-Germain over the summer.</p>

<p>Silva has one of football's most glittering CVs with a Scudetto success at AC Milan followed by 18 domestic honours in France.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva is determined to deliver silverware to Chelsea as he prepare for his club debut</p>

<p>The Brazilian defender, 35, has been training for a few days after his arrival from PSG</p>

<p>He was also part of the Brazil teams that won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2019 Copa America.</p>

<p>But the defender is far from done yet and believes Chelsea will be in the title race despite their 2-0 loss to reigning champions Liverpool on Sunday.</p>

<p>He told Chelsea's official website: 'What motivates me, day by day, is the hunger to win. To win everything within my reach.</p>

<p>'Coming to the Premier League, my main goal is to win the league title and I'm certain that we'll be fighting for that every step of the way.</p>

<p>'The team is really strong, we've got a great coach and I've come here to contribute in whatever way I can to ensure we get as close as possible to achieving those aims.</p>

<p>Silva helped PSG to the Champions League final last month but they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich</p>

<p>'That's what motivates me: stepping out onto the pitch and then winning, winning and winning some more. I don't think about anything else.'</p>

<p>Silva still hopes to play for Brazil at the next World Cup in Qatar in 2022 and thinks regular football for Chelsea will help him achieve that ambition.</p>

<p>'The prospect of playing at the next World Cup is another thing that really drives me,' he said.</p>

<p>'I'll be more or less 38 years old by the time of the next World Cup and I'm hugely motivated to be in good shape for it.'</p>

<p>Silva signed for Chelsea on August 28 but only started training with his new team-mates last Wednesday after PSG reached the Champions League final, losing 1-0 to Bayern Munich on August 23.</p>

<p>That meant he missed Chelsea's opening two Premier League games against Brighton and Liverpool.</p>

<p>But Andreas Christensen's suspension after his red card against Liverpool and doubts over Antonio Rudiger's future could mean his debut will likely come in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Chelsea play Barnsley in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night before travelling to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.</p>
