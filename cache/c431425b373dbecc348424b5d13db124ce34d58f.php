<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Teenagers have been paid to flood social media with pro-Trump material in a strategy compared to a Russian trolling campaign, it has emerged. </p>

<p>The Twitter and Facebook campaign is funded by Turning Point Action, a sibling of conservative youth group Turning Point USA, according to a Washington Post report which says that thousands of social media posts have emanated from the group. </p>

<p>Some of the posts have echoed Trump's claims about fraudulent mail-in voting or criticized America's top virologist Dr Anthony Fauci, while others describe Joe Biden as a puppet for 'dangerous' hard-left socialists.   </p>

<p>Turning Point did not deny the claims but said the youngsters were engaged in 'sincere political activism' and rejected comparisons to a Russian 'troll farm'. </p>

<p>Donald Trump (pictured at the White House on Tuesday) is having his re-election bid backed by an army of teenagers paid to flood social media with pro-Trump material </p>

<p>Twitter has already taken down 20 accounts since the Post gathered evidence of the online blitz, while Facebook has also deactivated some accounts.  </p>

<p>According to some of the people involved, the messages were scheduled and directed by Turning Point activists in a highly co-ordinated campaign. </p>

<p>The youngsters posted from their own accounts, with some of them identifying themselves as Trump supporters and others giving no such details.  </p>

<p>Teenagers were told to reply to posts by Democratic politicians with messages that promoted Trump and the Republican point of view. </p>

<p>People familiar with the campaign described a shared online document of language which could be used in pro-Trump posts on Twitter and Facebook. </p>

<p>However, they were told to alter the language slightly and limit their number of posts to avoid some of Twitter and Facebook's detection measures to crack down on bots and trolls.  </p>

<p>The teenagers are paid an hourly rate and can earn more money if their posts do particularly well, it is claimed.  </p>

<p>'It sounds like the Russians, but instead coming from Americans,' said Google software engineer and researcher Jacob Ratkiewicz.  </p>

<p>A company working with Turning Point confirmed that there were 'independent contractors' paid to work online, but did not give further details. </p>

<p>Austin Smith, a Turning Point field director, told the Post that the group had 'transitioned' to online activism after the 2020 campaign was disrupted by the pandemic.  </p>

<p>'This is sincere political activism conducted by real people who passionately hold the beliefs they describe online, not an anonymous troll farm in Russia,' Smith said. </p>

<p>He added that young people were 'excited' to share their views on social media over the summer, although some have since gone back to school.  </p>

<p>Twitter has already taken down 20 accounts since receiving evidence of the online blitz co-ordinated by Trump supporters </p>

<p>Facebook says it has shut down some accounts after the website was used by Russian-linked accounts in an effort to influence the 2016 election </p>

<p>The father of two girls involved in the campaign said the content was no worse than that posted online by Democrats and their supporters. </p>

<p>Another expert, University of Pennsylvania communications professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson, said the campaign would familiarize youngsters with online activism.  </p>

<p>Many of the activists are based in Phoenix, Arizona, in a state seen as one of the key battlegrounds of the 2020 election. </p>

<p>Trump won the state narrowly against Hillary Clinton four years ago, but recent polls have shown Biden narrowly ahead there. </p>

<p>Turning Point USA, founded by Charlie Kirk in 2012, describes itself as a non-profit organization with a 'mission to identify, educate, train, and organize students to promote the principles of freedom, free markets, and limited government'. </p>

<p>The group talks openly of its aim to 'saturate social and traditional media markets' with its conservative views. </p>

<p>Social media 'influencers' sympathetic to Turning Point have a combined following of more than 20million people, according to the group's website. </p>

<p>President Trump has previously spoken at Turning Point USA events, including at a rally hosted by the group in Phoenix in June this year.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Facebook announced a series of new measures to 'secure the integrity of the US elections' - after previously admitting that accounts linked to Russia had spent up to $100,000 trying to influence the 2016 race. </p>

<p>The site announced during the Democratic primary campaign that it had blocked Russian and Iranian accounts trying to boost Bernie Sanders at Biden's expense. </p>

<p>A report said the accounts reused messages from the Internet Research Agency which targeted US audiences in 2016. Russia has always denied interference. </p>

<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg (pictured) announced a series of new measures to 'protect the US election' earlier this month </p>

<p>Facebook's new measures include the removal of posts which exploit the fear of catching Covid-19 to discourage people from voting. </p>

<p>Posts about the legitimacy of mail-in voting will also come with an 'informational label', Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said. </p>

<p>'We've invested heavily in our security systems and now have some of the most sophisticated teams and systems in the world to prevent these attacks,' he said. </p>

<p>'We've removed more than 100 networks worldwide engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior over the past couple of years, including ahead of major democratic elections. </p>

<p>'However, we're increasingly seeing attempts to undermine the legitimacy of our elections from within our own borders.'</p>

<p>Twitter says it has introduced a tool allowing users to report misleading information about voting methods. </p>

<p>Both Facebook and Twitter have posted disclaimers on controversial posts by Trump in recent months, including about mail-in votes. </p>

<p>Postal voting has come under far greater scrutiny this year because of the pandemic and resulting social distancing rules. </p>

<p>Trump has frequently raged at 'fraudulent' mail-in ballots, in what critics say is an effort to delegitimize the results of an election that he appears on course to lose.  </p>

<p>However, Trump has also been accused of playing down the Russian threat to the election. </p>

<p>In 2018, Trump caused an outcry after accepting Vladimir Putin's denials at a summit in Helsinki, before later backtracking. </p>

<p>Special counsel Robert Mueller warned after publishing his report on the 2016 election last year that Russia was already meddling in the current campaign. </p>
