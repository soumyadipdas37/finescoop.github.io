<p>On May 16 an article ‘Mutiny in the Climate Camp’ reported accusations of hypocrisy over a decision to fly delegates to a conference in Bolivia.</p>

<p>We cited critical quotes from an internal email but, in fact, these did not relate to the conference decision.</p>

<p>Additionally we misattributed Facebook comments to campaigner Ben Hart and incorrectly said he had attended the conference. We apologise for these mistakes.</p>
