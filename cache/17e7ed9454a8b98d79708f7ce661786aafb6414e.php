<p>The Block stars Jimmy and Tam (pictured) have defended their decision to spend $5000 on high-end WINE to hopefully tempt prospective buyers come auction day</p>

<p>Judge Shaynna Blake initially suggested Tam invest in a rare art piece for their house as a 'game changer' for auction day, but Tam instead spent $5000 on rare wines for their state-of-the-art bar fridge.</p>

<p>'I knew we had this amazing Gaggenau wine fridge and I wanted something that was pretty high end to go in the fridge to meet the standards,' she said.</p>

<p>'The wine that has been selected, it's actually from the most prestigious real estate areas around the world,' explained Tam, adding: 'Anyone who knows wine, when they see what's in the wine selection, they're blown away.' </p>
