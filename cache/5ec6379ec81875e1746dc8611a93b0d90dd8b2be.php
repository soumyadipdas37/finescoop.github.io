<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Conservative MP Andrew Bowie has had to endure a barrage of abuse after he posted a picture of his fish and chips dinner on social media.</p>

<p>When the MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine shared the tasty snap he was expecting to receive a comment or two. </p>

<p>But hundreds of Twitter users latched onto the image and blasted the politician for being 'posh' as his meal had only six chips, before scribbling 'f*** off you Tory c***', 'Scottish Tory 6-chip twat' and 'Tories can't even be trusted with fish and chips'.</p>

<p>The Conservative Vice Chair for Youth shared the responses online and said they might discourage younger generations from entering politics.</p>

<p>The MP for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine received a barrage of abuse after he posted this picture of his fish and chips dinner on social media</p>

<p>The MP said comments he had received included 'greedy s***', 'demented' and 'Tories can't even be trusted with fish and chips'</p>

<p>The politician said the response online may put off young people from becoming politicians. He is pictured above asking Rishi Sunak MP a question in the House of Commons on July 7</p>

<p>Posting the so-called offensive tweet of his evening meal, the politician wrote: 'Spent the evening talking fish? Only one option for dinner. #seaofopportunity #britishfishandchips.'</p>

<p>After it was slammed online, the MP felt he was forced to post about how this attitude can affect young people entering politics.</p>

<p>'I regularly get asked as Conservative Vice Chair for Youth if 'social media' might put people off getting into politics,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'Last night I posted a picture of my dinner, a plate of fish and chips. These are a selection of the responses.'</p>

<p>He added a screenshot which showed what he said people had written in response, including '#w*****', 'another lying Tory coward' and 'greedy s***'.</p>

<p>One Twitter user responded: 'Have you ever considered that young people don't like Tories because of the things Tories say and do and not because of 'social media' or because they are somehow starved of the opinions of Toby Young.'</p>

<p>Another typed: 'If it's any consolation you could easily become a five-chip twat by eating one of the chips. </p>

<p>'Hold the phone, I've just thought of a way you could become a four-chip twat.'</p>

<p>And a third added: 'Where's the rest?!'</p>

<p>Other social media users, however, came to the Scottish politician's defence.</p>

<p>'Abuse towards anyone (including MPs) is never acceptable, and despite political differences, solidarity to you Andrew,' one said.</p>

<p>'As a young person, from an area where it is considered "wrong" to support (or be a member of) the Conservative Party, this is what puts me off pursuing a political career in later life,' said a second.</p>

<p>'People who have nothing better to do than post vile comments against people they don't know.'</p>

<p>And a third person also voiced their support, stating: 'It really doesn't matter what's your political persuasion... this just isn't on.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Andrew Bowie MP for comment.</p>
