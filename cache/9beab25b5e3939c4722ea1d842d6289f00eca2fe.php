<p>Apple has helped the FBI access iCloud information from one of its customers who is suspected of firebombing police cars in Seattle in the days following the death of George Floyd in May. The FBI received a tip about this masked man at a protest in Seattle on May 30</p>

<p>Video footage shows a male suspect throwing what appears to be a glass bottle with an ignited fabric or paper wick through the open driver's side door of a police vehicle in Seattle</p>

<p>According to a search warrant obtained by Forbes, Kelly Jackson was arrested last week for allegedly setting fire to at least two police patrol cars on May 30.</p>

<p>As the FBI looked into the tip, agents checked surveillance feeds, social media images and news footage.  </p>

<p>They eventually obtained phone records from Verizon and found that the suspect was using an iPhone 7. </p>

<p>The FBI then reached out to Apple for help accessing the suspect's iCloud information. </p>

<p>And though Apple has previously refused to help the government hack into the physical iPhones of a Saudi national who shot dead three people at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida, in December 2019, the company helped the FBI in the case against Jackson. </p>

<p>Their search through his iCloud returned potential evidence in the form of screenshots that were reportedly hosted in Jackson's photo library.   </p>
