<p>And earlier this year the 41-year-old launched her own podcast after she sensationally quit her radio gig at 2Day FM.  </p>

<p>In addition, she is also a doting mother-of-three - but would you recognise her from this throwback photo taken when she was in High School? </p>

<p>Guess who! This Australian comedian and radio presenter isn't afraid to tell it like it is - but would you recognise her from this throwback school photo</p>

<p>In the picture, she is sporting a blue and white striped school uniform and her brown locks are worn loose in a shoulder length bob.  </p>

<p>The young teen in the photo is none other than media personality, Em Rusciano.  </p>

<p>'I just remember feeling overwhelming shame, all the time about everything. My body would go rogue at the most inopportune times, I woke up on this day, school photo day, with THREE cold sores! I was hairy, I was sweaty, and I was super sensitive to EVERYTHING,' she added. </p>

<p>Em left her 2Day FM job two years ago amid rumours of 'diva behaviour' and disputes with management. </p>

<p>'Fists are up, and you're either, get in or get out of the way, and my behaviour was pretty appalling in radio,' she explained.</p>

<p>'Every time I've stepped into radio, my behaviour deteriorates and it's appalling, and I know that, and that's why I will never step back into radio, because I hate the person I become.'</p>
