<p>A Florida resident was arrested for drunk driving after crashing his car into an electronic road sign that said 'Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over', officials say.</p>

<p>Police found Cheramy outside his car around 12.30am on the Tamiami Trail in Port Charlotte.</p>

<p>Cheramy’s car sustained 'heavy front-end damage' in the incident and the roadway sign was knocked over.</p>

<p>Cheramy told police he was talking to a friend on the phone when he 'suddenly struck something' but was unsure 'what he had struck or how he was hit', according to the arrest affidavit.</p>

<p>Police said he smelled of alcohol and was swaying back and forth and could not focus on the deputy’s questions, according to The Smoking Gun. </p>
