<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Horrified builders discovered a severed human head and the rest of a body in a nearby bush in a quiet village yesterday.</p>

<p>Construction workers are said to have called police after the grisly discovery in Frankley, Worcestershire, on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>West Mercia Police said it was treating the death as unexplained.</p>

<p>It's not yet known what state the remains were in, but police say identification could be a 'lengthy process'. </p>

<p>Police cordoned off a field in Frankley, Worcestershire, yesterday after a severed human head was found - a body was found in a bush nearby</p>

<p>Officers closed Egg Hill Lane - where the remains were found, as they investigate the grim find. </p>

<p>No cause of death has been established at this stage. </p>

<p>One resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'We've never seen anything like this here, there were police everywhere.</p>

<p>The identity of the remains has not yet been established, with local police saying it could be a 'lengthy process'</p>

<p>'They have searched a huge area of the countryside around it and everyone is in shock. We heard it was a severed head that was found and then cops found the body.</p>

<p>'You can only imagine what it was like finding that if that is the case, it doesn't bear thinking about.'</p>

<p>The scene is close to where searches were previously carried out in the high-profile case of murdered estate agent Suzie Lamplugh, who disappeared aged 25 in 1986.</p>

<p>The county also recently saw a dig undertaken in relation to the murder of businessman Jesse Richards, 40, who was killed in Evesham in July 2009.</p>

<p>Another local resident John Caswell, 47, added: 'All I know is that they found a body in a bush next to a path, which is horrible.</p>

<p>'We have very little trouble here and you don't expect it. We've had our fair share of murders in surrounding areas but never this close to home.'</p>

<p>Locals say builders set up their own barrier to shield passers-by from the grisly discovery, before police later raised a cordon</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Mark Walters said: 'We are in the very early stages of an investigation and our inquiries are just getting under way.</p>

<p>'We are currently treating this as an unexplained death and no identification has yet been made. </p>

<p>'While this could be a lengthy process, we will update the public in due course.'</p>

<p>The discovery was made in Frankley, a quiet village in Worcestershire, near Birmingham, on Thursday on morning</p>

<p>Local resident Frank Edgar told The Sun: 'My wife and I were on our way back from Halesowen and the road was closed.'</p>

<p>'I'm told some builders working further up Egghill Lane found a body up there.</p>

<p>'They actually put up their own makeshift barriers to stop others going up there and rang the police.'</p>
