<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Below Deck Mediterranean star Malia White has responded after Captain Sandy Yawn recently suggested she's secretly gay.</p>

<p>Yawn, who is an openly gay woman, claimed on Cameo that White's sexuality is the reason she split from Tom Checketts and that the crew suspected White was gay.</p>

<p>In a selfie video shared to her Instagram on Wednesday, White, 30, first confirmed her split from Checketts and then expressed her shock that Yawn would talk about such a personal issue. </p>

<p>'Shocked': Below Deck Mediterranean's Malia White has addressed Captain Sandy's comments about her being secretly gay</p>

<p>'Hey guys, it's Malia. My personal life seems to be quite the topic at the moment. I am not on Twitter, I don't do a lot of Instagram Lives, so I thought that I would send out a message in my own words. </p>

<p>'So, first off, yes, Tom and I have split. The details surrounding all of it, I am trying to keep a little private, just out of respect to him and I. But yes, I am single,</p>

<p>'Second, Captain Sandy's Cameo - I was just as shocked as everyone else. I'm not sure why my sexual orientation is being discussed in Cameos. </p>

<p>'First off, if I was gay, I would just like to say it should be my decision when and if to out it to the entire internet,' she continued. </p>

<p>'I'm not, but if I was, I would be openly proud to be gay. I'm a huge supporter of the community and, yeah, I'll just leave it at that.' White, 30, explained in an Instagram video on Wednesday</p>

<p>In a cameo video this week Captain Sandy Yawn said, 'Malia…I think she's secretly gay, to be honest. That's my opinion. Everybody in production thinks that.'</p>

<p>'But no, I'm not, but if I was, I would be openly proud to be gay. I'm a huge supporter of the community and, yeah, I'll just leave it at that.'</p>

<p>In Yawn's video, she said, 'Malia…I think she's secretly gay, to be honest. That's my opinion. Everybody in production thinks that.'</p>

<p>She immediately then appeared to regret her words as she covered her mouth and said, 'Oh! That's gonna be public isn't it! Okay so maybe…who knows!'</p>

<p>She later apologized for the comment, saying on Instagram on Wednesday, 'I was wrong for making that comment, that clip was taken out of context,</p>

<p>'That clip was taken out of context, it was sliced to make it into something it was not. My apologies to Malia!' she added.</p>

<p>It's a strange turn for the duo's friendship as they have always been close, with Malia looking to Captain Sandy, 55, as a mentor.  </p>

<p>The post came just a day after Malia hinted at her new single status.   </p>

<p>She shared a glowing selfie where she held up a glass of white wine and toasted to good times, writing: 'Cheers to all the ladies out there in their 30’s, single, focused on their careers &amp; that give zero f**ks!'</p>

<p>Not her place: She immediately then appeared to regret her words as she covered her mouth and said, 'Oh! That's gonna be public isn't it! Okay so maybe…who knows!'</p>

<p>Cheers to that!  White has confirmed she's now single after splitting from Tom Checketts</p>

<p>White followed with several empowering hashtags, adding: #stayfocused #dirtythirty #bossbabes and, the most telling, #thankyounext - the title of Ariana Grande's ever-popular breakup song.</p>

<p>Making it very, very clear she was done with Checketts, Malia completely scrubbed her Instagram of any of his photos. </p>

<p>She had comments turned off for her entire account, however, not letting fans speculate about what exactly went down during the breakup. </p>

<p>Keeping up appearances? While White made it pretty clear she was flying solo, Tom muddied the waters by sharing some shots from a romantic vacation just one week ago</p>

<p>Confusing: 'A very brief trip to London with this one X' he wrote along with a fun set of pictures from a trip across the pond</p>
