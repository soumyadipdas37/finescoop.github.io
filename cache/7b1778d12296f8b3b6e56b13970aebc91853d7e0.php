<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian mother has shared how she is preventing any carpet 'accidents' around the house while toilet training her three-year-old son.</p>

<p>Shar Christoff Harris purchased Target's $59 Summer Infant My Size Potty for the family lounge room because her little boy 'isn't a fan' of the regular toilet, and she thought it might make it easier for him to learn.</p>

<p>But with carpet surrounding the 'training zone' the Perth woman needed to come up with a way of protecting her precious floor - and discount store Kmart had the answer.</p>

<p>'Toilet training my son... thank you Kmart for a 100 pack of puppy pads for $20. Now our carpet won't get completely destroyed,' she wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>Do you think puppy training pads are a good idea for toilet training toddlers?</p>

<p>Do you think puppy training pads are a good idea for toilet training toddlers?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>Photos of her son surrounded by white pads ignited a debate online with some people loving the idea and others voicing their concerns.</p>

<p>'Great idea! When I was toilet training my son I would put a frozen pea into the bowl and ask him to shoot at it,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'This is a bit over the top if you ask me,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'This is genius. I'll definitely be copying this so I can put away the mop'. </p>

<p>'Most reactions are like anything on the internet, some people love it... and some have send me private messages telling me what a terrible mother I am,' Shar told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>Shar only started the process on August 31 and her son has already started using the potty (left)</p>

<p>Tracey Fulwood became a professional toilet trainer in Australia after she realised she was handling her own daughter's toilet training all wrong.</p>

<p>This is what she DOESN'T suggest you do when it's time to start: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Don't train a child in pull ups or nappies, only use underwear. They need to feel the wetness so they know when a mistake has been made.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't rely on your child to tell you when they need to go, they often don't know at this stage.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>3. Any indication that a child is aware of what their body is doing is a sign to start toilet training, don't wait longer than you have to.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li><p>Don't bribe your child to use the toilet. She explained that it is the role of parents to establish boundaries from the beginning.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't force a young child to be toilet trained straight away. It will be a process so take your time. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>'I've had a lot of people stand up for me, which is lovely, but everyone is entitled to their opinion. I'm the one who has to do the clean up so unless the negative Nancy's want to come help I don't really mind what they say.'</p>

<p>Shar said that the family lounge room doubled as her son's playroom and it's the place he feels happiest.  </p>

<p>'Since he's not a fan of the normal toilet I didn't want to be constantly taking him to the bathroom and causing him to have a meltdown,' she said.</p>

<p>'I decided on the puppy pads just so I didn't have to constantly scrub the carpet after an accident.'</p>

<p>Shar only started the process on August 31 and he has already started using the potty.   </p>

<p>'It's awesome as this is our third time trying to toilet train but since he's scared of the normal toilet traditional methods haven't been successful,' she said.</p>
