<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has lifted the lid on why new star man Timo Werner was absent from the kick-takers in his side's penalty shootout defeat by Tottenham.</p>

<p>Werner has impressed since his summer arrival from RB Leipzig and was expected to be one of the Blues' first five penalty takers on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Instead, the German was nowhere to be seen and Lampard explained after the game that he was suffering from cramp and refused the chance to step up to the spot.   </p>

<p>Werner's cramp stopped him from taking what could have been a decisive penalty in the tie</p>

<p>'We spoke to the players,' said Lampard afterwards. 'You work on penalties and try and have a plan but it's very difficult to know. </p>

<p>'Timo had some cramp at the end and Timo would have probably taken one so we had to adjust around that.'</p>

<p>In the shootout, all of the first nine penalties were scored, with Eric Dier, Tammy Abraham, Erik Lamela, Cesar Azpilicueta, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Jorginho, Lucas Moura and Emerson all successfully finding the net.</p>

<p>Mason Mount instead stepped up and sent his penalty wide to confirm Tottenham's victory</p>

<p>Then, much to Blues fans' surprise, rather than Werner it was Mason Mount who stepped up for the decisive kick, but he could only find the outside of the post and Chelsea were knocked out.</p>

<p>Mount's missed spot-kick means Tottenham go through to the quarter-final of the Carabao Cup, and they will find out their opponents for the next stage of the competition on Thursday.  </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho's side now have less than 48 hours' rest before their home Europa League play-off clash with Maccabi Haifa. </p>
