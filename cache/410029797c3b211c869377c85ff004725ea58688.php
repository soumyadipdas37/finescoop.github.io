<p>'[The video] will be coming to you from the middle of the ocean. Serious, literally, with Pink. It will be premiering exclusively on Facebook. I can't wait for you guys to see this video. I think it turned out amazing,' he said.</p>

<p>The pair's video will premiere on Thursday afternoon at 2PM AEST.  </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Urban also served as the CMA's 2020 host and was nominated for male artist of the year category, which was won by Luke Combs. </p>
