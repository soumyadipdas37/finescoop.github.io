<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lisa Curry and her ex-husband Grant Kenny put on a united front as they bid farewell to their eldest daughter Jaimi at her funeral on Saturday, following her tragic death aged 33. </p>

<p>And new reports claim Jaimi was largely to thank for keeping her tight-knit family together, even until the end.  </p>

<p>'She was so fiercely protective of her parents and sister and brother,' a friend told Woman's Day magazine of Jamie, who died last Monday after battling an eating disorder and alcoholism for years. </p>

<p>Revealed: How 'fiercely protective' Jaimi Kenny helped keep her family together even after her parents' divorce before her tragic death aged 33. Pictured L-R: Jaimi Kenny, Ryan Gruell, Morgan Gruell, Grant Kenny, Lisa Curry, Jett Kenny </p>

<p>'She believed in family first and even after her parents split, she loved everyone coming together for Christmas and special family occasions - she was a one-in-a million, with a smile like sunshine that will now light up the heavens,' they added. </p>

<p>Jaimi is survived by her younger siblings, brother Jett Kenny and sister Morgan Gruell.  </p>

<p>Following the separation of her parents in 2009, Jaimi made great efforts to maintain a strong relationship with Grant's new partner Fifi Box and their first daughter Trixie. </p>

<p>'She loved everyone coming together for Christmas': The source said Jaimi was loved celebrating festive occasions with her family. Pictured: Jaimi with her family including mother Lisa Curry, father Grant Kenny, sister Morgan Gruell and brother-in-law Ryan Gruell </p>

<p>Separation: Lisa and Grant separated in 2009 after 23 years of marriage, before finalising their divorce in 2017. They are pictured with Jaimi on the Sunshine Coast on April 3, 2008</p>

<p>Grant dated radio star Fifi for several months in 2012, but had broken up by the time she welcomed daughter Beatrix 'Trixie' Belle via IVF the following year. </p>

<p>Fifi did not acknowledge Grant was Trixie's father until 2016, when she shared a photo to Instagram of the retired athlete attending their child's third birthday party. </p>

<p>Despite the unusual circumstances, Jaimi kept a close friendship with Fifi, and would even babysit her much younger half-sister Trixie on occasion while single mum Fifi was at work. </p>

<p>Nothing but love:  Jaimi would even babysit her much younger half-sister on occasion while single mum Fifi was at work (pictured in 2015)</p>

<p>Prior to her death, Jaimi had expressed her desire to one day have a family of her own, and absolutely doted on the children in her family. </p>

<p>'Jaimi absolutely adored children and was especially close to Trixie,' a family friend told Sunshine Coast Daily. The children gave her 'a whole new lease on life'. </p>

<p>Jaimi was also fiercely protective of her mother in the face of criticism.</p>

<p>In 2014, Jaimi blasted false and hurtful reports that Lisa was planning to have children out of 'revenge' because her ex-husband had just become a father again.  </p>

<p>'Jaimi absolutely adored children': Jaimi's half-sister Trixie (L) was the centre of of universe, sources claim </p>

<p>Family ties; Jaimi (right)  also maintained an amicable relationship with her mother's (centre) new husband  Mark Tabone (left) prior to her tragic death </p>

<p>At the time, Lisa was dating a man two decades her junior, Joel Walkenhorst, and there were rumours the couple wanted to have children.</p>

<p>Much of the commentary on social media was negative, and it was suggested by some that Lisa's desire to have a baby at 51 was about 'getting back' at ex-husband Grant, after he welcomed Trixie with Fifi Box in 2013.  </p>

<p>As reported by New Idea, Jaimi stepped up to defend her mother at the time.</p>

<p>She wrote on Instagram: 'Mum wanting a child had nothing to do with Fifi... Mum had talked with us about her thoughts on going through IVF before Trixie was conceived.</p>

<p>'You never know the conversations we have had as a family, or the timing of these. It's upsetting to read such nasty things being said about our mother, without people knowing her personally.'  </p>

<p>Jaimi Kenny died at Sunshine Coast University Hospital in Queensland on Monday morning surrounded by her family, including both her Olympian mother and Ironman father.</p>

<p>Fake news: At the time, much of the commentary on social media was negative - and it was suggested by some that Lisa's desire to have a baby at 51 was about 'getting back' at Grant, who had welcomed a daughter with radio host Fifi Box in 2013. Pictured with Joel</p>

<p>Dozens of devastated family and friends gathered for the funeral on the Sunshine Coast on Saturday afternoon, after the tight-knit clan spent almost a week grieving the loss of the 'bright, bubbly' Jaimi. </p>

<p>Those in attendance congregated out the front of the church, tearfully exchanging hugs before Jaimi's immediate family followed them out of the service. </p>

<p>Lisa could be seen bursting into tears as her husband Mark Tabone, family members and friends, all tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>Supportive: Jaimi stepped up to defend her mother, writing on Instagram: 'Mum wanting a child had nothing to do with Fifi... Mum had talked with us about her thoughts on going through IVF before Trixie was conceived'</p>

<p>Jett, Morgan and their devastated parents embraced as Jaimi's white coffin, covered in pink and orange dahlias and baby's breath, was placed in the back of the hearse and carried away.</p>

<p>The heart-wrenching final goodbye was made all the more difficult with only 100 family and friends allowed to attend under Queensland coronavirus restrictions.</p>
