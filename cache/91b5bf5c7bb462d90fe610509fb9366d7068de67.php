<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hungry Jack's has taken a swipe at McDonald's in a cheeky TV ad as the rivals go head-to-head in a law suit over a new burger.</p>

<p>The competitors became embroiled in a court battle following the launch of the Hungry Jack's 'Big Jack' in August.</p>

<p>McDonald's was quick to file documents in the Federal Court alleging the Australian chain's new menu item is 'deceptively similar' to its Big Mac trademark.</p>

<p>While Hungry Jack's is yet to file a defence, the company took a sledge at its rival claiming its burger is bigger with a different flavour.</p>

<p>McDonald's is suing Hungry Jack's over their 'Big Jack' burger (pictured) and trademark</p>

<p>A voiceover in the Big Jack ad says: 'Someone is suing Hungry Jack's.</p>

<p>'They reckon Aussies are confusing the Big Jack with some American burger. </p>

<p>'But the Big Jack is clearly bigger with 25 per cent more Aussie beef, flame grilled with a barbecue taste.'</p>

<p>McDonald's have held the 'Big Mac' trademark since 1973 and allege Hungry Jack's used 'flagrant or wilful disregard' in promoting its 'Big Jack' burger.  </p>

<p>According to the McDonald's website, the Big Mac contains: 'Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.'</p>

<p>McDonald's believe the Big Jack is 'substantially identical or similar' to their own Big Mac (pictured)</p>

<p>The Big Jack features: 'Two flame-grilled 100 per cent Aussie beef patties, topped with melted cheese, special sauce, fresh lettuce, pickles and onions on a toasted sesame seed bun.'</p>

<p>Hungry Jack's has been promoting the new burger since July, but McDonald's Asia Pacific claims the Big Jack burger is 'likely to deceive or cause confusion'.</p>

<p>Court documents say the U.S.-based franchise has ordered for the Big Jack trademark to be cancelled, news.com.au reported.</p>

<p>It is also suing for damages, interests and costs, and is calling for Hungry Jack's to destroy all promotional materials, menus, brochures, marketing materials and documents featuring the Big Jack trademark. </p>

<p>McDonald's (store in Maryborough in Victoria pictured) want Hungry Jack's to destroy all material with 'Big Jack' trademark</p>

<p>'Hungry Jack's is bemused by the trademark lawsuit filed against it in the Federal Court,' a Hungry Jack's spokseperson told the publication.</p>

<p>'This is without basis. Big Jack is a registered trademark of Hungry Jack's and it is clearly evident that customers are not confused or misled that the Big Jack and Mega Jack burgers are only available at Hungry Jack's.'</p>

<p>A McDonald's Australia spokeswoman previously told Daily Mail Australia 'as this matter is before the court, it is not appropriate to comment at this time.'</p>
