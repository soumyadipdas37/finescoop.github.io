<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Torrential rain is set to batter huge swathes of Australia in the coming days, before temperatures soar during an unexpected heatwave over the public holiday long weekend. </p>

<p>Thunderstorms are brewing across most of the country with a low pressure trough triggering windy weather and showers throughout Australia's east coast from Tuesday.</p>

<p>Weatherzone meteorologist Sam Brown warned the 'severe' storms would bring 'damaging wind gusts' from Tuesday onwards.    </p>

<p>'There is a low pressure system and associated trough moving through South Australia at the moment and that's causing storms in the northern parts.   </p>

<p>'That same system is moving further east into tomorrow and there will be storms for central north New South Wales from about tomorrow morning,' he explained. </p>

<p>A low pressure system will move through South Australia on Tuesday and bring severe winds an heavy rain to the country's east coast on Wednesday (a rainy day in Sydney pictured) </p>

<p>Thunderstorms and gusty winds will largely affect parts of southern Queensland, eastern New South Wales and southern Victoria (Melbourne pictured on September 22) </p>

<p>Mr Brown said the storms would progress over Victoria, NSW and south Queensland until Friday. </p>

<p>'There will be thunderstorms for much of eastern New South Wales and there'll be showers associated with all those storms and some gusty winds,' he said. </p>

<p>He explained there was 'storm potential' across most of the country thanks to the 'unstable atmosphere and temperatures coming down from the tropics.'    </p>

<p>Mr Brown said parts of Western Australia would also experience the wet weather. </p>

<p>'They'll get a few storms in the far south west and far east near the South Australian border.  </p>

<p>'There's potential for storms everyday in the north of Western Australia in the Kimberley region and western parts of the top end,' he explained.   </p>

<p>The Bureau of Meteorology's Diana Eadie told Daily Mail Australia the system would bring 'wide-spread shower and storm activity.'</p>

<p>Heavy rainfall will batter South Australia on Tuesday (low pressure trough across Australia pictured) and is expected to fall at 5 to 15 mm but could be as high as 60 mm</p>

<p>Wide-spread shower and storm activity will hit Sydney (city pictured) on Wednesday </p>

<p>Meteorologists said the 'shower, storm and rain activity' would subside across the east coast (Sydney Harbour pictured) and spark sunny weather and a mini heatwave on the weekend </p>

<p>'The low pressure trough will move through eastern parts of Western Australia, southern parts of the northern territory and South Australia,' she said. </p>

<p>Ms Eadie explained South Australia would see 'the most significant rainfall totals' on Tuesday.   </p>

<p>'We're expecting 5 to 15 millimetres but we could see as high at 40 to 60 millimetres in far north western parts of South Australia.'</p>

<p>She said the system and its 'shower, storm and rain activity' would progress eastwards on Wednesday.   </p>

<p>'We will see an increase in shower and storm activity over southern Queensland, much of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. </p>

<p>Temperatures will climb across the east coast (Bondi Beach in Sydney pictured) on Friday and reach up to ten to twelve degrees above average for the time of the year</p>

<p>Melbourne and Sydney (Bondi Beach pictured) will both reach 28C on the long weekend  </p>

<p>'That will all subside on Friday and we're likely to see a pretty much sunny day across most of the country and warm conditions,' she said.  </p>

<p>Ms Eadie said east coast residents would 'be enjoying sunny weather' over the weekend and Labour Day public holiday on Monday. </p>

<p>'Saturday will be the warmest day for the southeast and we'll see temperatures up to ten to 12 degrees above average for this time of year.' </p>

<p>'It's pretty unusual, Melbourne will be 28C on Saturday and Sydney will be 26C on Saturday and 28C on Sunday,' she explained. </p>

<p>Mr Brown added 'central and southern parts of NSW' would be dry and regional parts of the state would see temperatures into he low thirties over the weekend.    </p>
