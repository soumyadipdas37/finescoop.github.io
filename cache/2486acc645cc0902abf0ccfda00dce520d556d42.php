<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kylian Mbappe's reported decision to inform Paris Saint-Germain that he wants to leave next summer has got plenty of people talking, none more so than the Spanish press.</p>

<p>According to the Times, the French World Cup winner has made clear his plans to leave PSG in the summer of 2021, putting Europe's elite clubs on hot alert - most specifically Real Madrid.</p>

<p>And on Monday morning, the Spanish press were quick to jump on the news and struggled to contain their excitement about the possibilities ahead.</p>

<p>Marca ran the headline: 'We are waiting for you Mbappe', alongside the Real Madrid badge</p>

<p>AS report that the French World Cup winner - a big target for Real Madrid - 'took the plunge' </p>

<p>Madrid-based Marca ran with the headline alongside the Real badge: 'We are waiting for you Mbappe', after dropping the transfer bombshell on the Ligue 1 giants.</p>

<p>They then go on to report that Madrid will wait to see how Mbappe's situation develops over the coming year, and will not reach out straight away to PSG over a potential deal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, fellow Madrid paper AS published the following headline on their front page: 'Mbappe takes the plunge.'</p>

<p>AS also state that Zinedine Zidane's side are set to postpone their long-running transfer interest by 12 months and make their move for the 21-year-old at the end of the campaign.</p>

<p>Spanish giants Madrid are plotting a move for Mbappe at the end of the current campaign</p>

<p>Mbappe is contracted to PSG until 2022, meaning next summer is the last opportunity for the Parisians to sell their star asset before running the risk of losing him as a free agent.</p>

<p>Therefore, Madrid will look to pounce and add his name to their star-studded attack as they eye European domination once more. </p>

<p>PSG made a huge investment in Mbappe, signing him from AS Monaco in 2018 for a fee in the region of £165million.</p>

<p>The deal remains the second highest ever paid for a footballer, behind PSG's marquee capture of Neymar after triggering his Barcelona release clause.</p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane's Madrid side are planning a ruthless spending spree next summer</p>

<p>PSG are said to have made multiple lucrative offers to Mbappe in hope of getting him to commit his future to the club, including a promise to see him as their highest ever paid player while pledging to build the team around him in future.</p>

<p>But the World Cup winner already has his eyes on pastures new, and it appears Madrid are front-runners for his signature.</p>

<p>Madrid have already drawn up a battle plan for next summer's transfer window, with Mbappe set to be the headline signing while they also target Dayot Upamecano and Eduardo Camavinga.</p>

<p>Liverpool, Manchester United and Manchester City have all been linked with Mbappe in the past too.</p>
