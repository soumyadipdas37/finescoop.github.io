<p>The Office of Traffic Safety has campaigned that 'DUI Doesn't Just Mean Booze,' and warns that 'if you take prescription drugs, particularly those with a driving or operating machinery warning on the label, you might be impaired enough to get a DUI.'</p>

<p>'Marijuana can also be impairing, especially in combination with alcohol or other drugs, and can result in a DUI,' they added.</p>

<p>Marijuana is available to those with a prescription in California.</p>

<p>While the musician and Olivia Jade have been on-and-off – breaking up in May 2019 around the time of her parents' scandal and reuniting last August – they couple has been seen out together as recently as last Wednesday.</p>

<p>It's unknown whether Olivia Jade, who turned 21 on Monday, was with Guthy when he was pulled over this month.</p>

<p>However after shying away from the spotlight so not to further damage her influencer brand in the wake of Operation Varsity Blues, Guthy is one of the few people the vlogger will see these days according to reports.</p>

<p>'Olivia really loves him,' a source previously told Us. 'He's so chill and laid-back that she can't help but be comfortable around him.'</p>

<p>'Throughout this ordeal, Olivia was distant from her former sorority sisters and certain people she was close to before the news broke,' another insider told Us Weekly in May. </p>

<p>'Her former friends were not sure if it was based on legal advice or the fact that she felt too embarrassed to face the situation to old friends. Now, Olivia has been more open to communicating with them and rekindling those friendships.'</p>

<p>Lori Laughlin was sentenced in August to two months in prison and issued $150,000 in fines for her participation in the scheme by helping her two daughters fake qualifications to get into the University of Southern California.</p>
