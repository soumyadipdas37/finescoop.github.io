<p>They confirmed that the producer hadn't been adhering to the care plane that he and Kim agreed on, though she 'isn't surprised' by that development and partly blames it on the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Although she was able to overlook his erratic tweets, it was 'the mood swings and the manic episodes [that] are extremely difficult for Kim to help Kanye cope with.'</p>

<p>Kanye had previously been staying isolated at his Wyoming ranch, and after taking a family vacation he's gone back to traveling on his own. </p>

<p>Kanye and Kim share four children: North, seven, Saint, four, Chicago, two, and Psalm, 16 months.</p>
