<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians have been warned to keep an eye out for dangerous spiders as the mercury begins to rise ahead of summer. </p>

<p>Lauren Merritt from Darwin, was horrified to see almost 20 venomous mouse spiders lying on the bottom of her pool last week.  </p>

<p>Experts have urged residents to keep a distance from the unwanted visitors explaining that while many were found underwater, most were likely still alive.  </p>

<p>Lauren Merritt spotted up to 20 mouse spiders lying in her pool in Darwin last week</p>

<p>While the spiders are small in size experts have warned bites can be severely painful and can cause illness in small children </p>

<p>Julian Bracewell from Pest2Kill, a pest control company in Sydney's eastern suburbs said September to May was their busiest season for spider sightings.</p>

<p>He said it was common for Mouse spiders to fall into swimming pools, but warned the creatures can usually survive.</p>

<p>'They're not always dead, they can stay alive for quite some time  - up to 24 hours,' Mr Bracewell told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'A lot of people confuse Mouse spiders for Funnel Webs because they're very similar looking and are ground dwelling as well.'</p>

<p>Mouse spiders are found across Australia and have similar physical characteristics to Funnel Webs - which have fatal bites.</p>

<p>They can grow up to 35mm long and their bites can cause severe pain and serious illness.</p>

<p>Mouse spiders often fall into swimming pools but can survive underwater for up to 24 hours</p>

<p>Often found in more bushy environments, Mouse spiders live across the country.</p>

<p>Mr Bracewell said as it begins to heat up over the coming months, more people will see the creatures making their way into their homes and backyards.</p>

<p>Mouse spiders are venomous to humans with bites causing severe pain and illness</p>

<p>They can grow up to 35mm long and can survive underwater for up to 24 hours</p>

<p>Mouse spiders are often found during the warmer months as they try to find mates</p>

<p>They are found across Australia but usually in areas with dense bushland</p>

<p>Mouse spiders are often confused with Funnel Webs but are not considered as dangerous to people </p>

<p>'Mouse spiders aren't as aggressive as Funnel Webs but they are venomous so handle with care and use gloves or a pool cleaner,' he said.</p>

<p>'A bite is pretty painful and will cause illness to young children. It's similar to a Redback, their fangs are pretty long and anyone bitten should be taken to hospital.'</p>

<p>The pest control expert said there were steps to ensure homes were safe from spiders, but stressed it was a bad idea to try and remove them alone.</p>

<p>'If you're gardening use proper gloves. Hose down children's toys as we often find Redbacks hidden in toys outside,' he said.</p>

<p>'Keep you garden maintenance up to scratch, ponds and stagnant water can attract flies and mosquitoes which spiders eat. </p>

<p>'If you see burrows in your garden call an expert. I wouldn't handle that yourself.'</p>

<p>Around 1,000 Australians visit hospitals every year for spider bites.</p>

<p>There's been just one death from a spider within the last 37 years.</p>

<p>Jayden Burleigh, 22, died after he was bitten in April, 2016 by a Redback while walking through a bushwalk in NSW's north coast.</p>
