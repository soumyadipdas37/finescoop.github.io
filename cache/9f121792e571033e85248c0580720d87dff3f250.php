<p>In the moment: COVID-19 has directly affected spring 2021's sartorial landscape. From contemporary brands to high-end labels, designers (Tom Ford included!) have embraced these unprecedented times by addressing our quarantine needs</p>

<p>Cozy chic: We saw luxe loungewear, stylish sweatsuits and cozy knit separates come down almost all the runways in New York, Milan and Paris this month</p>

<p>The most surprising trend this season is 'pared down simplicity and elegance,' according to Wolf &amp; Badger's Creative Director &amp; Co-Founder, Henry Graham</p>

<p>Relaxed suiting: By now we've all learned that working from home effectively takes practice, discipline and the right outfit</p>

<p>By now we've all learned that working from home effectively takes practice and discipline. </p>

<p>The most productive people don't roll out of bed and head straight to the computer in their pjs. They start their day by getting dressed in presentable clothes. </p>

<p>The good news is that loungewear has come a long way so you can look great while still being comfortable in your makeshift home office.</p>

<p>And professional workwear including suits, blazers and slacks, have become less formal and more relaxed.  </p>

<p>'Dressing up is as important now than ever,' said Henry. To look chic in the most comfortable way possible, Henry recommends sleepwear from Not Just Pajama.  </p>

<p>Founded in London 2015 the brand creates luxurious silk sets that are as fashionable for indoor/outdoor wear as they are comfortable. </p>

<p>From the sheets to the streets: 'Dressing up is as important now than ever,' said Henry. 'Loungewear has done really well for us.' Henry recommends sleepwear from Not Just Pajama</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>'Pared down simplicity and elegance,' is the most surprising trend this season said Henry. 'It works super well when transitioning from home to work or play.'</p>

<p>In addition to fabulous pajamas, the expert recommends 'knits in beautiful soft yarns.'</p>

<p>Boss, N21 and Drome styled silky pajama separates with knitwear at their spring 2021 presentations.</p>

<p>Henry suggests oversized styles to carry out the comfy cozy feel.  </p>

<p>'We have lots of amazing, neutral toned pieces made using luxe fabrics and subtle shapes. This season is going to be all about understated elegance.' </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>As clothing categories are becoming more relaxed and effortless, so is footwear. </p>

<p>'Mules are really trending right now, as are slip-ons,' shared Henry. 'They both work well for that casual, dressed-up look for a chic walk to the shops.' </p>

<p>For style and versatility Henry favors Osay the label, Bala Di Gala and Atelier de Charlotte.</p>

<p>Fashion right now is functional. Designers have said said bye-bye to mini bags in favor of oversized carryalls that carry all. </p>

<p>'I'm a huge fan of Kartu Studio,' said the expert.</p>

<p>And don't forget jewelry! A pair of statement earrings can turn a silk robe or casual two-piece set from meh to amazing!</p>

<p>The must-have accessory this fall? The face mask, of course! It's important to find a style that fits properly, is effective and suits your look.</p>

<p>Wolf &amp; Badger has a wide selection from brands like Jessica Zoa, Adelina Rusu and NY Charisma.   </p>

<p>Carryall: As seen at Boss spring 2021, oversized bags are also trending</p>

<p>Street style: 'Pared down simplicity and elegance,' is the most surprising trend this season said Henry. 'It works super well when transitioning from home to work or play,' said Henry</p>

<p>While Wolf &amp; Badger pays attention to runway trends, they carry brands from all over the world and are often ahead of the game.  </p>

<p>'Designers are selected based on their innovation of design, finish and quality of workmanship,' shared Henry.</p>

<p>'We also focus on brands that share our ethos of ethical and sustainable production.'</p>

<p>Polish brand AGGI offers and array of unique pieces (including face masks, cocktail dresses and tailored blazers) at affordable price points.   </p>

<p>Babaloo jewelry celebrates women. Each piece is meant to evoke confidence and make the wearer feel as unique and wonderful as they are.  </p>

<p>For the girl who likes to stand out (in and out of quarantine), Paloma Lira Studio is the answer.</p>

<p>The brand was established in 2012 with the cultural and social changes of 60's, 70's &amp; 80's and its influence nowadays as its muse. </p>

<p>Established in 2016 True Decadence's  philosophy is centered around creating occasion wear in effortless silhouettes that celebrate femininity.      </p>
