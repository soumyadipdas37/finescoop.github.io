<p>Sergie Aurier is 'keen on a move to AC Milan' after Tottenham signed Matt Doherty from Wolves</p>

<p>The arrival of Doherty means Aurier will be further down the pecking order at the club</p>

<p>According to Football Italia, Aurier is focused on securing a switch to the San Siro. Bundesliga side Bayer Leverkusen have also been linked with a move for the full-back.</p>

<p>Spurs paid £23m to sign the Ivory Coast international from Paris Saint-Germain in 2017.</p>

<p>But the 27-year-old had a frustrating first season in the Premier League with just eight appearances.</p>

<p>Milan have had a bid of just under £13million rejected with Spurs holding out for £18m </p>

<p>The defender failed to force a move last summer but went on to become a regular starter under Jose Mourinho following Mauricio Pochettino's departure.</p>

<p>Aurier managed eight assists and two goals across all competitions in the 2019-20 season.</p>

<p>In comparison, new boy Doherty made seven assists and scored five goals. </p>

<p>Milan are on the lookout for a new right back but are said to have other transfer targets including Brescia's Sandro Tonali, Chelsea's Tiemoue Bakayoko and Real Madrid's Brahim Diaz. </p>
