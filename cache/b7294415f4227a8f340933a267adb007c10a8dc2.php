<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump fired off tweets Monday stoking a conspiracy theory that Democrat Joe Biden was reading his responses from a teleprompter during an April interview on 'The Late Late Show interview' – even after the show's producer debunked the claim.  </p>

<p>Trump retweeted speculation that Biden had been caught 'red handed' during a TV interview – when the presidential candidate held up a framed image of a photo with his sons Beau and Hunter Biden that showed a reflection from the camera filming him.</p>

<p>Amid charges about the reflection, the show's producer has revealed it was the script read by the show's host, comedian James Corden, and that the system the show uses allows for no other option. </p>

<p>Donald Trump allies put forward the claim that Joe Biden read from a teleprompter during an interview, an unproven assertion that the president retweeted Monday</p>

<p>'His handlers and the Fake News Media are doing everything possible to get him through the Election. Then he will resign, or whatever, and we are stuck with a super liberal wack job that NOBODY wanted!' Trump wrote, in comments attached to the tweet – just his latest effort to cast Biden as incapable of performing his responsibilities.</p>

<p>GOP strategist Andrew Surabian, who ran the 2016 Trump campaign's 'war room' and worked with Steve Bannon in the White House, put forward the claim on Twitter Saturday. </p>

<p>Trump allies spotted a glare on the glass when Biden held up photos of him with his children</p>

<p>CBS 'Late Late Show' executive producer Ben Winston refuted the claim, saying it was Corden's lines being reflected</p>

<p>GARAGE COMEDY: Corden has been doing shows from home, but the comedian who slings off one-liners reads a script during lead-ins for his show, his producer says</p>

<p>Trump retweeted former campaign aide Andrew Surabian who claimed Biden was 'caught redhanded'</p>

<p>Trump also retweeted GOP strategist Arthur Schwartz, who himself had retweeted a claim Biden was using a teleprompter during the interview</p>

<p>'On zoom they see all our screens including our prompter. It’s the only way it can be done,' wrote producer Ben Winston</p>

<p>Biden grew emotional as he spoke about his late son Beau (l) and his son Hunter (r)</p>

<p>'So here we have Biden caught redhanded using a teleprompter during a tv interview with James Corden. Now we know why his spokesman refused to answer <?php echo e('@'); ?>BretBaier's question about this the other day,' he wrote. 'Who wants to bet that the media is going to ignore/cover this up to protect Joe?'</p>

<p>The tweet included an image of the moment during the Corden interview posted by Republican National Committee Rapid Response Director Steve Guest, who wrote: 'That reflection... Joe Biden was using a teleprompter for an interview with James Corden.'</p>

<p>The show's executive producer Ben Winston on Saturday posted an image and tagged several people who have put forward the claim about Biden. </p>

<p>He wrote:  'so sorry to disappoint you. I am the exec producer of <?php echo e('@'); ?>latelateshow. That’s actually James’s prompter. Not <?php echo e('@'); ?>joebiden‘s. On zoom they see all our screens including our prompter. It’s the only way it can be done.'</p>

<p>He went on to explain: 'Biden didn’t pin his screen. James has two screens. One for guest picture and one for script which is off camera. You can hunt for a conspiracy theory as much as you like. Sadly you won’t find one here !'</p>

<p>He continued in a dialogue online with conservative commentator Mike Cernovich. 'Honestly - it’s the only feed we can send him. That’s the real 100% truth. It’s our prompter. If he pins JC camera it means he can’t see Reggie who also asks a question , &amp; the other cameras for the show. So the prompter screen has to be on there.'</p>

<p>Beyond the more technical holes in the argument, Biden does not appear to say anything remotely challenging during the interview, speaking about his children and grandchildren and offering reminiscences. Corden had asked him to share something special from his home, in an interview conducted during state coronavirus lockdowns.   </p>

<p>The picture that drew scrutiny is one of Biden, Hunter Biden, and Beau Biden when they were in college that the former vice president says hangs in his bedroom. </p>

<p>'I'm really lucky to have great kids,' Biden says as he grows emotional at the end of the interview. </p>

<p>'“Anyway, I wish everyone else good health and thank you for taking the time to be with me. And I want to thank all the people who have been so good to me when I had been through some tough times,' Biden concludes.</p>

<p>Biden campaign spokesman TJ Ducklo refused to engage when Fox News anchor Bret Baier pressed him on the claim in an interview last week. </p>

<p>“We are not going to — this is straight from the Trump campaign talking points. And what it does, Bret, is it’s trying to distract the American people from,' he said.</p>
