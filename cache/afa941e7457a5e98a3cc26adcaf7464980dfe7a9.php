<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Government officials have rushed to replace a New Zealand flag displayed above a bridge after a driver noticed a mistake with its design.</p>

<p>Motorists on Sydney's Anzac Bridge spotted the flag with a unique design pattern displayed on top of one of the two towers above the motorway.</p>

<p>Both the Australian and New Zealand flags are flown atop the bridge and both show the Southern Cross and Union Jack.</p>

<p>But in the version seen above the bridge, the New Zealand flag's Southern Cross pattern is wrong.</p>

<p>The final red star that normally appears at the bottom of the Southern Cross is seen below the Union Jack.</p>

<p>A New Zealand flag with a mistake on it (pictured) has been displayed above Sydney's Anzac Bridge</p>

<p>The wrong flag has been flying above the bridge for more than a month. </p>

<p>New Zealand Flag Association President John Moody was unimpressed.</p>

<p>'I think New Zealanders would feel a certain disrespect,' he told 7News.</p>

<p>Mr Moody was unsure as to why the wrong flag had been put up. </p>

<p>'It could be laziness, ignorance... it may have been somebody who thought somehow the New Zealand flag was similar to the Australian flag,' he said.</p>

<p>A Transport for NSW spokesperson said the wrong flag had been changed. </p>

<p>'Transport for NSW was made aware of an incorrect New Zealand flag flying on the ANZAC Bridge and replaced it overnight,' they said.</p>

<p>'The issue arose due to a manufacturing fault by the supplier.' </p>
