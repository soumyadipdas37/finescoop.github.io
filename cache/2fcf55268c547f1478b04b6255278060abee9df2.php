<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Marcos Alonso could link up with former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte for a second time after feeling Frank Lampard's wrath last weekend, according to The Times.</p>

<p>The Blues defender was savaged by his manager in front of the rest of the squad after returning to the team bus following his half-time substitution during their 3-3 draw away at West Brom.</p>

<p>And Alonso could now be on the move before the transfer window shuts next week, with Conte keen to work with him again at the San Siro.</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso could reunite with former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte at Inter Milan</p>

<p>Conte celebrates with Alonso following Chelsea's victory away at Everton in April, 2017</p>

<p>The Times claim that the Spaniard is interested in a switch to Italy after being frozen out for large chunks of last season and falling down the pecking order following the arrival of £50million Ben Chilwell earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Alonso enjoyed arguably the best season of his career under Conte, playing as a left wing back in his 3-4-3 formation as Chelsea won the Premier League title in 2016-17.</p>

<p>Conte has already reunited with Victor Moses at Inter, who he converted into a right wing back for his title-winning team at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Chelsea are keen to cash in on either Alonso or Emerson Palmieri this week after Lampard landed Chilwell as his new first choice left back.  </p>

<p>Inter have also shown an interest in the former Roma star, but it remains to be seen if they will be able to agree a deal for either defender before the window closes.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard was furious with Alonso last weekend after he returned to Chelsea's team bus</p>

<p>Inter have also shown an interest in Emerson Palmieri (right) - and Chelsea are willing to sell</p>

<p>Alonso was left out of Chelsea's squad for Tuesday night's Carabao Cup penalty shootout defeat by Tottenham following the incident with Lampard on Saturday.</p>

<p>The Athletic claim that Alonso attempted to watch the second half of the match at the Hawthorns on the team coach rather than with the Chelsea substitutes - an act that infuriated his manager.</p>

<p>An insider said: 'The players were saying they have never seen the manager like this.</p>

<p>'It kicked off after the game and he was going mad at Alonso. Some were talking about how they'd be surprised if he plays for Chelsea ever again.'</p>

<p>Alonso had endured a difficult first half and was at fault for two of West Brom's three first-half goals. Chelsea fought back after the break to draw 3-3. </p>
