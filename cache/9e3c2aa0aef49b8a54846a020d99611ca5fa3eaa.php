<p>'I have the best home movies': Kris Jenner has admitted her family's decision to axe KUWTK was 'kind of sudden' as she appeared on Wednesday's edition of The Ellen DeGeneres show</p>

<p>Matriarch Kris has starred on the iconic programme since its inception in 2007 alongside her former spouse Caitlyn Jenner and her children Kourtney, 41, Kim, 39, Khloe, 36, Rob, 33, Kendall, 24, and Kylie, 23.</p>

<p>Shedding light on how the reality stars settled on surprise choice, the entrepreneur told host Ellen, 62: 'It was kind of sudden.</p>

<p>'We were talking about signing with our network for another couple of years, but we all came to the decision as a group, it just all came to us after 20 seasons and 14 years. </p>

<p>'It's so weird to think that when we started the show, there was barely Twitter and no other social media sites, no grandchildren, people weren't married or divorced. It's amazing to think that I have the best home movies in the world.'</p>

<p>Admitting Khloe was 'pretty torn up' about their verdict, Kris added: 'The most emotional is Khloe, we all got emotional when we had to break it to the crew. We've been with the same crew since the start, they are now like extended family to us.</p>

<p>'Khloe was the saddest, she stayed with the crew for hours reminiscing about old times. This chapter has been so amazing, we're so blessed to have this experience.'</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the interview, the socialite broke her silence on rumours she could be set to switch lanes and join RHOBH.</p>

<p>'I would do it once in a while to be with my friend Kyle Richards': The socialite broke her silence on rumours she could be set to switch lanes and join RHOBH (pictured with Kyle in 2019)</p>

<p>She explained: 'I would do it once in a while to be with my friend Kyle Richards, but as far as me doing a show like that regularly, I just don't have enough time. They do not need a Kris Jenner on that show, they're doing just fine.' </p>

<p>Presenter Ellen made a comeback to screens earlier this month after allegations of mistreatment and misconduct behind the scenes at her shows emerged. </p>

<p>Throwing her support behind her longtime friend, Kris said: 'We've seen a storm or two in our day, we've been through a lot of crazy stuff, but the storm does past. </p>

<p>'Hopefully we all come away with a lesson. I just love you so much, such a dear and wonderful friend, I'm so proud of you. You do things and give things to people that people don't even give about.' </p>

<p>The season premiere for the show scored a 1.9 Nielsen household rating, the same number as last year, according to Variety.</p>

<p>The View was comfortably the winner on Monday night with a 2.7 rating. In the key demographic of those aged 25-54 however, The Ellen DeGeneres Show gained from a 0.9 from a 0.8 in 2019.  </p>
