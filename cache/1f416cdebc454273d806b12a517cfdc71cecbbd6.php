<p>President Donald Trump demanded that Reuters reporter Jeff Mason take off his mask to ask a question at a White House news conference on Monday</p>

<p>Jeff Mason of Reuters (pictured) had just begun speaking when Trump cut him off and said: 'You're going to have to take that off, please. You can take it off. How many feet are you away?'</p>

<p>Throughout the exchange Mason's voice was very easy to understand, despite his face covering to prevent the spread of coronavirus.   </p>

<p>But Trump - who has sparred with reporters on numerous occasions in the past, including about masks - was visibly irritated by Mason's refusal to take his off.  </p>

<p>At another point in the briefing when another reporter took of his mask to ask a question, Trump replied: 'You sound so clear.' </p>

<p>This isn't the first time Trump has ridiculed Mason specifically for wearing a mask.  </p>

<p>During a briefing back in May, the president asked Mason to remove his covering and then accused him of trying to be 'politically correct' but refusing.  </p>

<p>Most reporters in the White House press pool have insisted on wearing masks during briefings, even though the president himself rarely dons one. </p>

<p>Trump for months was reluctant to be photographed wearing a mask, and on several occasions refused to put one on in buildings that required them. </p>

<p>In July he finally got on board with the CDC's messaging about the importance of masks and urged all Americans to wear them in public places. </p>
