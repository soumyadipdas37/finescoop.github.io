<p>The advert first aired on Australian television in September 2000 and featured actress Deborah Kennedy playing an office boss.</p>

<p>In the ad, Kennedy asks her employee 'Jan' why an ad for their business had not been placed in the Yellow Pages. </p>

<p>The employee begins to run away from the office building before Kennedy sticks her head out of a partially opened window and screamed the famous line.   </p>

<p>Kennedy said the 30-second clip had become even more comedic thanks to a 'lucky accident' that wasn't part of the script, The Daily Telegraph reported. </p>

<p>The iconic Yellow Pages ad that coined the phrase 'Not Happy Jan' has celebrated its 20-year- anniversary </p>

<p>The advert first aired on Australian television in September 2000 and featured actress Deborah Kennedy (pictured) playing an office boss </p>

<p>The Australian actress explained the window was actually jammed.    </p>

<p>'It was a very old building in Surry Hills and it just happened that this window was this horrible thing that only opened a few inches. </p>

<p>'But it certainly added to the humour and the frustration of the moment,' Kennedy said.    </p>

<p>She also explained how the advertisement became a cultural saying for Australians. </p>

<p>'Like swearing at your kids without swearing. It just took on a life of its own … it was everywhere.'  </p>

<p>Kennedy said she was often wrongly credited for coining the line but it was actually created by art director Tony Greenwood</p>

<p>The ad itself was developed by agency Clemenger BBDO and was overseen by creative director Ant Shannon.</p>

<p>Kennedy (pictured in Sydney in 2018) revealed the jammed window was a 'lucky accident' that wasn't part of the script </p>

<p>Mr Shannon said Yellow Pages were known as a 'creative client' and their goal was to develop an 'emotional connection' between Australians and the directory. </p>

<p>He explained how Mr Greenwood, from England, proposed the line in his thick Yorkshire accent and the production team thought it was hilarious.   </p>

<p>Early audiences said the ad was only 'mildly amusing' and the team had 'no idea' the clip would become so famous.   </p>

<p>Mr Shannon also attributed the cult success of 'Not Happy Jan' to its release at the end of the golden age of TV advertising.</p>

<p>He said ads before the interned 'had to be talked about' and would be discussed within families and groups of friends. </p>

<p>The production crew had 'no idea' the ad (pictured) would become a cultural sensation </p>
