<p>Arsenal legend Nigel Winterburn has come to the defence of Alexandre Lacazette </p>

<p>Lacazette has received mixed reviews since he joined the Gunners back in 2017</p>

<p>He said: 'He's being touted around as somebody who could possibly be used as bait to try and bring in some money, but I've stated all along that Lacazette is a player I really like, I think he's the one centre-forward at Arsenal that really links up the play better than anyone else at the club. </p>

<p>'But then a lot of people feel his goalscoring record isn't good enough at the top level, though I think you have to look at the bigger picture.</p>

<p>'I would be disappointed if he was to leave this summer, but Arteta may be planning to adjust Arsenal's style of play and if they can secure Aubameyang's contract extension maybe he'll feel as though he has enough cover in that role which would allow him to let Lacazette go and recoup some money.</p>

<p>'I like his strength and power in key positions though, so personally I'd like to see him stay.' </p>

<p>Former full-back Winterburn believes Lacazette has much more to offer than just goals</p>

<p>'I think a lot of people have a big issue with age, but having played to nearly 40 myself I don't really see age as justification.</p>

<p>'I think it's all about performance and desire to be able to better yourself and I think it's quite clear with Willian that he's still got a lot to offer.</p>

<p>'I think, potentially, if he can maintain the level he had at Chelsea with Arsenal, we've got a very good player on our hands, someone who can play in several positions. What will be very interesting for me, will be how Arsenal line up and what positions will certain players be playing in, particularly if a few more signings are pulled off.</p>

<p>'That's the most intriguing thing for me as we approach the start of next season.'</p>
