<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the bizarre moment a rat was caught on camera fighting back against a cleaner who was trying to rescue it from a skate park with his broom.</p>

<p>Zay Shaeffer, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, filmed the unexpected encounter between his friend Joseph and the squeaking rodent.</p>

<p>The critter charges toward the fully-grown male, who is attempting to clean the area, with remarkable success as the man is sent tumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>Zay Shaeffer, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, filmed the unexpected encounter between his friend Joseph and the rodent</p>

<p>In the clip, Joseph can be seen wearing a green T-shirt, brown shorts and a bandana as he frantically waves a broom around.</p>

<p>The rat is hopping around energetically near his feet before it scuttles off toward the other side of the bowl.</p>

<p>Joseph chases after the rodent as it squeals with Zay urging his friend to take it easy.</p>

<p>But just a few seconds later the rat makes an unexpected turn and runs directly toward Joseph before getting caught up under his feet.</p>

<p>The cleaner is sent flying to the ground in a panic but quickly gets back up.</p>

<p>He kicks the animal aside before it launches a second attack which causes him to lose his balance and stumble once again. </p>

<p>Zay, from behind the camera, says: 'I told you, you don't want to get in there with that thing Joseph.' </p>

<p>The video then cuts off but Zay and Joseph said afterwards that they eventually cleared the rat from the bowl by using an abandoned BMX as a makeshift ladder for it to climb. </p>

<p>Speaking after the unusual interaction, Zay said: 'We were just working together one morning and picking up trash at the skatepark.</p>

<p>'When we ran across that rat stuck in the skate bowl.</p>

<p>'It chased me out first and then Joseph got in there for whatever reason.'   </p>
