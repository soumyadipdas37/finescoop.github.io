<p>All love: Big Sean revealed his hit song IDFWU wasn't a 'diss' to his late ex Naya Rivera, who he was engaged to from 2013 to 2014, in a new interview with Vulture out Tuesday (River and Sean pictured in 2013)</p>

<p>'I truly made the song and played it for her,' the GOOD Music rapper said. 'She knew about it, and she liked it.' </p>

<p>Fans have long speculated the song was about Rivera due to the lyrics and timing of the song. </p>

<p>The couple started dating in early 2013 and announced their engagement just six months later, in October. They went on to spit in April 2014, amid cheating rumors. Rivera married Ryan Dorsey in July of the same year, on the date she was scheduled to wed Sean. </p>

<p>'We had a breakup that was very public,' Sean said. 'And we were young and we forgave each other and moved on from that.' </p>

<p>She liked it: 'I truly made the song and played it for her,' the GOOD Music rapper said. 'She knew about it, and she liked it.' Fans have long speculated the song was about Rivera due to the lyrics and timing of the song (Sean pictured in January 2020)</p>

<p>In IDFWU he raps 'I heard you got a new man, I see you takin' a pic / Then you post it up, thinkin' that it's makin' me sick,' seeming to reference Rivera's quick new romance. </p>

<p>Though when asked if he now 'regrets' making the song he said 'That's a tough question to answer because I'm still processing a lot of that.'  </p>

<p>The song continues 'She choose him, that's her decision...I got a new chick that I gotta thank God for,' Sean announced he was dating Ariana Grande a month after IDFWU was released in October.</p>

<p>Sean admitted that he is still processing her death, after she went missing at Lake Piru after renting a boat with her young son Josey, and her body was recovered five days later.  </p>

<p>Relationship: The couple started dating in early 2013 and announced their engagement just six months later, in October. They went on to spit in April 2014, amid cheating rumors. Rivera married Ryan Dorsey in July of the same year, on the date she was scheduled to wed Sean (Sean and Rivera pictured in 2013)</p>

<p>'I don't feel comfortable talking about it because I want to respect her,' the I Know hitmaker said. 'She's made such an impact on people, and she's done so many great things in her life and her career that it was hurtful to even have that [song] be associated with her.'</p>

<p>Adding: 'If I would have known something this tragic would have happened, I would have never made the song.' </p>

<p>In her book, Sorry Not Sorry, Rivera heavily implied that Grande and Sean's relationship may have been more than friendly while the rapper and actress were together, though they seemed to have repaired their relationship after the split.</p>

<p>After fighting, Rivera said she went to Sean's house announced writing 'I walk in, go downstairs, and guess what little girl is sitting cross-legged on the couch listening to music?… It rhymes with "Smariana Schmande."'  </p>

<p>Respect: 'I don't feel comfortable talking about it because I want to respect her,' the I Know hitmaker said. 'She's made such an impact on people, and she's done so many great things in her life and her career that it was hurtful to even have that [song] be associated with her'</p>
