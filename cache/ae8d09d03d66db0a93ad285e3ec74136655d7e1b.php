<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian tech expert has revealed a simple step to follow to avoid losing thousands of dollars to slick cyber criminals.</p>

<p>Hacker Alex Hope said it was vital for all online users to use the two-factor authentication security process when typing in their personal login details. </p>

<p>'That way each person has their own email (address), password and then you will also be sent a six digit unique code (in a text message) before logging in,' he said on Sunrise.</p>

<p>'It makes it harder for hackers to (potentially) access your details.'</p>

<p>Two factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to protect against account hijacking. It also leaves users feeling at ease when they are using personal or business financial websites.</p>

<p>Tony Abbott (pictured above) was hacked by Alex Hope after the former PM posted a boarding pass on Instagram back in March</p>

<p>Hope also stressed the importance of not inadvertently uploading personal details on different forms of social media. </p>

<p>'I would try to avoid posting any information which could easily identify you,' he said.  'Never post things like your email, personal address or phone number.' </p>

<p>*Enable Two-Step Authentication</p>

<p>* Check a Site’s Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate</p>

<p>* Don’t Save Financial Information on Shopping Sites</p>

<p>*Be Careful Who You Trust</p>

<p>* Create Strong, Unique Passwords</p>

<p>In March this year, Hope attracted global headlines after successfully uncovering the details of former Prime Minister Tony Abbott from his Qantas boarding pass in just 45 minutes.</p>

<p>It followed the politician sharing a snap of his boarding pass on Instagram.   </p>

<p>Speaking on a blog post, Hope revealed he was able to access Mr Abbott's personal information by simply using the booking reference printed on the boarding pass. </p>

<p>'In seconds I had Tony Abbott's passport number, phone number and weird Qantas messages about him,' Hope said.</p>

<p>'Anyone who saw that Instagram post could also have them.' </p>

<p>Hope then got in contact with Mr Abbott's staff, Qantas and the Australian Signals Directorate, who all thanked him for bringing the issue to their attention.  </p>

<p>He also spoke to Abbott personally about his online 'detective work', which Hope labelled 'humanising.'</p>

<p>'When I’d collected myself from various corners of the room, he (Abbott) asked if there was a book about the basics of IT since he wanted to learn about it. </p>

<p>'It made me realise that even famous people are just people too.' he told SBS' The Feed.</p>

<p>Hackers can use personal details to access people's online banking accounts, or pose as them for internet transactions. </p>
