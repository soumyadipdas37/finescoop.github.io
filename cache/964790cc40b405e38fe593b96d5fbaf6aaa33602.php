<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A drunken mother-of-two has been captured on video falsely claiming she was raped and causing £4,000 worth of damage during a rampage at a takeaway.</p>

<p>Ann Marie Fowler, 33, was spared a prison sentence and told to pay £400 compensation after she trashed takeaway Kebabish in Falkirk, Scotland, during an outburst shortly before midnight on July 21.</p>

<p>Footage captured the moment Fowler threw food, flashed her breasts at horrified workers, smashed a glass cabinet and hit the owner in the head with a charity collection tin. </p>

<p>She also grabbed a worker by the t-shirt as he was on the phone to police, and shouted 'you raped me, you raped me' while pulling down her top and bra to expose her breasts.</p>

<p>Ann Marie Fowler, 33, was spared a prison sentence and told to pay £400 compensation after she trashed takeaway Kebabish in Falkirk during an outburst shortly before midnight on July 21. Pictured grabbing at one of the workers' t-shirts</p>

<p>Fowler - who was on her way back from visiting her son in hospital - admitted racially aggravated assault and a string of other offences when she appeared at Falkirk Sheriff Court.</p>

<p>Her defence lawyer said benefits claimant Fowler would struggle to pay the compensation handed down.</p>

<p>She was also spared a prison sentence - to the dismay of owner Zohaib Arshad who described the £400 compensation order as 'an injustice'. </p>

<p>Owner Zohaib Arshad, 33, said: 'People are saying "maybe she's laughing in the pub for what she did and what she got".</p>

<p>'These people are getting money from our taxes and we are the victims. In the Muslim community the accusation of rape is a huge thing.</p>

<p>'We never knew that woman, we had nothing to do with that lady. She's taking her clothes off and accusing me of rape - that video has saved me.</p>

<p>Footage captured the moment Fowler threw food, flashed her breasts at horrified workers, smashed a glass cabinet and hit the owner in the head with a charity collection tin</p>

<p>'If we didn't have that video they might have arrested me, if I had been accused of rape I might have been taken in for questioning.</p>

<p>'Some people take their own lives because of accusations like that. Being racist is a crime. She accused us of rape and there was vandalism and racism.</p>

<p>'Everything went into the bin. The compensation should be higher and she must be jailed.'</p>

<p>Insurance did not cover the damage, and the smashed glass cabinet had to be replaced by a perspex one.</p>

<p>Father-of-two Zohaib said: 'The damage was £4,000 and we had to pay to dispose of the old one.</p>

<p>The moment Fowler smashed a glass cabinet. Insurance did not cover the damage and the smashed glass screen had to be replaced by a perspex one</p>

<p>'People in our community are saying it is white supremacy from the judge. She called us so many times "black b******s", they ignored that.'</p>

<p>During her tirade, she grabbed one staff member's t-shirt and appeared to spit at the workers. </p>

<p>Procurator fiscal depute Rachel Wallace said: 'She became aggressive asking for the food. She went to collect it and immediately threw the entire container up into the air.</p>

<p>'The accused then punched the electronic point of sale system, causing it to break. She continued to shout "Where's my food?"</p>

<p>A staff member handed over the original food box which Fowler again lobbed into the air before falsely claiming staff had raped her.</p>

<p>Ms Wallace added: 'The accused then picked up a charity collection tin and struck the witness on the head.</p>

<p>Owner Zohaib Arshad, 33, said the £400 in compensation was not enough to cover the costs of the damage</p>

<p>'This caused him to sustain a minor lump to his head which didn't require any medical attention.</p>

<p>'The accused then began removing items of her upper clothing while again shouting "You raped me".</p>

<p>'One witness contacted police. The accused began pulling on the glass display case and managed to pull another glass case off the unit.'</p>

<p>Police arrived a short time later and found two bank cards Fowler had dropped as she fled the scene.</p>

<p>Fowler pleaded guilty to shouting, swearing, uttering offensive remarks and wilfully destroying property belonging to another by punching a till, throwing items of food and pulling a glass display case containing items of food from its stand, causing it to fall to the floor and smash, at Falkirk Sheriff Court.</p>

<p>Fowler flashed her breasts at the workers and accused one of them of raping her. The owner, a father-of-two, said the video showing what really happened 'saved' him</p>

<p>Fowler, of Kelty, also admitted breaching a court-imposed curfew order to remain at home from 7pm until 7am daily by attending the shop and committing a racially aggravated assault on a man.</p>

<p>Defence solicitor Allana Turley said her client had gone to a pub on July 21 after a hospital visit to see her son who had broken his back. She also said Fowler had shown 'genuine remorse and regret'.</p>

<p>The solicitor told Sheriff Keith O'Mahony her client was on benefits and would struggle to pay a hefty compensation fee, suggesting Fowler would instead benefit from supervision and counselling for alcohol abuse.</p>

<p>Sheriff O'Mahoney told Fowler she was on the 'borderline' of a custodial sentence and, as a direct alternative to imprisonment, placed her under supervision for two years, during which time she must undertake alcohol counselling and pay £400 in compensation. </p>
