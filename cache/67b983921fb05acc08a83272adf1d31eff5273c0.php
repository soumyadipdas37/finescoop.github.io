<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Trump has justified the killing of an antifa protestor in Portland who shot dead a far-right Patriot Prayer supporter describing it as 'retribution'.</p>

<p>Speaking on Fox News on Saturday night to Judge Jeanine Pirro, the president explained how he sent in U.S. Marshals to specifically target antifa supporter 48-year-old Michael Reinoehl.</p>

<p>His killing came days after Reinoehl had fatally shot Aaron 'Jay' Danielson, 39, on August 29, when Trump supporters ended up clashing with Black Lives Matter supporters in Portland.  </p>

<p>Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was shot multiple times and killed by US Marshals outside an apartment block in Washington state on September 3rd</p>

<p>Danielson was a member of Patriot Prayer, a group which has organized rallies in support of Donald Trump and far-right protests in predominantly liberal areas, which have been met with large numbers of counter-protesters. </p>

<p>Last week, police officers investigating Danielson's death ended up fatally shooting Reinoehl after finding him in Lacey, Washington, south of Seattle.</p>

<p>Portland police had secured a second-degree murder warrant for Reinoehl in connection with Daniel's death according to Fox News.</p>

<p>Reinoehl was shot multiple times and killed by US Marshals outside an apartment block in Washington state. </p>

<p>The officers swooped in on the self-proclaimed anti-fascist to arrest him after he was charged with the murder of right-wing activist Danielson. </p>

<p>'We sent in the U.S. Marshals for the killer [Reinoehl] who shot the young man [Danielson] on the street. Cold blooded killed him. He didn't like his hat or something,' the president explained.</p>

<p>'It wasn't a Trump hat. It was a religious hat. And he shot him cold blood. Two-and-a-half days went by and I put out when are you going to go get him? The U.S. Marshals went in to get him and they ended in a gunfight,' Trump revealed.</p>

<p>'This guy was a violent criminal and the U.S. Marshals killed him. That's the way it has to be. There has to be retribution when you have crime like this. There can't be guys standing up that wanna fight. You can't throw bricks at people with shields.'</p>

<p>At least four officers, including two Pierce County Sheriff's deputies, a Lakewood police officer and a state Department of Corrections officer, fired multiple rounds at the suspect during the incident.  </p>

<p>Reinoehl appeared to confess to Danielson's death in a video interview with Vice News just hours before his own death.</p>

<p>In the video, Reinoehl said he had acted in self-defense and said his actions were 'totally justified'.</p>

<p>'I had no choice. I mean, I, I had a choice. I could have sat there and watched them kill a friend of mine of color. But I wasn't going to do that,' he said.</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging interview on Fox News the president discussed the upcoming election and vowed to crush any 'riots' that occur among opposition should he be declared the winner on Election night. The president said he would 'put it down within minutes.' </p>

<p>'Let's say there are threats. They say that they are going to threaten riots if they lose on election night, assuming we get a winner on election night. What are you going to do?' the host asked him.</p>

<p>'We'll put them down very quickly if they do that. We have the right to do that. We have the power to do that if we want,' Trump responded.</p>

<p>'Look, it's called insurrection. We just send in, and we do it very easy. I mean, it's very easy. I'd rather not do that because there's no reason for it, but if we had to, we'd do that and put it down within minutes. Within minutes,' Trump explained. </p>

<p>Trump has repeatedly gone after 'rioters' and 'looters' who he said are rival Joe Biden supporters. </p>

<p>Trump's use of the term 'insurrection' recalls his administration's threat to use the Insurrection Act to use military forces put down disturbances.</p>

<p>Trump told Fox News on Saturday night 'that's the way it has to be' after Reinoehl was shot by Marshalls. He is suspected of killing of Patriot Prayer supporter Aaron Danielson, August 29 </p>

<p>During the interview Trump went on to state how he believed Joe Biden to be 'on drugs'</p>

<p>Regarding his opponent, Trump alleged without evidence that rival Joe Biden was on drugs telling Piro, 'that's what I hear.'</p>

<p>Trump made the charge after repeatedly attacking his Joe Biden's mental capacity and stamina.</p>

<p>'It is probably, possibly drugs involved. That's what I hear,' Trump said.  </p>

<p>'I mean there's possibly drugs. I don't know how you can go from being so bad where you can't even get out a sentence,' Trump continued. </p>

<p>'I mean you saw some of those debates with the large number of people on the stage. He was – I mean, I used to say how is it possible that he can even go forward.' </p>

<p>Biden managed to prevail over a crowded Democratic field. He stumbled in some debates but many critics wrote that he improved as the debates wore on. His rivals ended up endorsing him en masse after they were defeated. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump again lodged allegations against Joe Biden, without evidence, that: 'It is probably, possibly drugs involved'. Biden is pictured on Friday in Delaware</p>

<p>Saturday night's interview also looked at Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic with the president suggesting the county had 'rounded the corner' and that the development of a successful vaccine was drawing ever closer.  </p>

<p>'They [the Democrats] don't want it because they are afraid it will make me look good... We are really rounding the corner. And we have good things out there already -- I would say you can't use the word cure yet. But pretty close to a cure,' Trump explained.</p>

<p>'The vaccine itself, it will come come out in October. But whether it's October, November, December. It will come out soon. We have great companies, they are advanced and the results will be good,' Trump insisted.</p>

<p>'We are doing [better] numbers now as we are rounding I think the final turn. With or without, having the vaccine is great. It will happen soon. It could happen in October. But we are rounding the turn on the virus. They have to open up. It's only the Democrats who are  closed. In my opinion they are closed for political reasons.'</p>

<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said drugmakers involved in coronavirus vaccine trials should be ready to start distributing vaccines by November 1.</p>

<p>Three vaccines set for distribution in the U.S. from Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca are currently in the final stages of clinical trials.  </p>

<p>Dr Fauci says U.S. won't get back to normal until late 2021 when a successful vaccine for COVID-19 could be widely distributed</p>

<p>However, Trump's assessment of the progress that the country is making in fighting the virus is does not align with that of the government's top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, who said that he disagrees with the president and stressed that the current statistics are disturbing.</p>

<p>Fauci, the outspoken director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the United States was starting the flu season with a high baseline of around 40,000 new cases a day with deaths averaging around 1,000 a day.</p>

<p>During the interview, Trump admitted to playing down the severity of the virus since it emerged earlier this year.</p>

<p>'Do you want me to jump up and down and say is everyone going to die? I'm a cheerleader for the country. I took tremendous steps, everybody knew how I felt... Look at the great leaders of the world. Winston Churchill stood on the rooftops of houses in London making speeches. You want calmness, you don't want somebody jumping up and down saying this is terrible. We want strength and leadership and we don't want panic.' </p>

<p>Trump then attacked veteran journalism BobWoodward, to whom he gave 18 on-the-record interviews for his book. </p>

<p>Bob Woodward's book 'Rage,' his second on Trump's presidency, comes out on September 15 </p>

<p>Extracts from Woodward's forthcoming book showed the president was more candid about its dangers in private conversations than he was in his public statements. </p>

<p>He also kept to his earlier strategy of arguing he was trying not to cause panic even as he had admitted to Woodward he was trying to down play the dangers of COVID, which has infected more than 6.39 million Americans and killed more than 191,000.</p>

<p>Trump said over and over again he didn't want to be seen in public warning of death.</p>

<p>Trump hasn't denied the comments he made to Woodward - he has previously called stories he doesn't like 'fake news'.</p>

<p>The author taped all 18 of his interviews with the president, which were conducted from December through July. </p>
