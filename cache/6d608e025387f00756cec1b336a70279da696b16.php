<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Night clubs have opted to open their doors as early as 3pm while others have introduced drink deals from 10am in a bid to beat Boris Johnson's curfew. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister's decision to order pubs, bars and restaurants to close at 10pm came into force last night, leaving scores of venues across England missing out on vital early hours service.</p>

<p>Under the tough new measures, establishments must offer table service only and are forced to kick customers out of their premises before the cut-off point or risk a fine. </p>

<p>But venues across the country have reacted by simply opening earlier to make up for the lost hours, with revellers able to head to night clubs in the mid-afternoon.</p>

<p>Popworld bars in York and Liverpool will open from 4pm on Fridays and 3pm on Saturdays amid the latest restrictions, with the bar also offering 50 per cent off deals until 8pm.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Caribbean restaurant Turtle Bay is offering a 'bottomless brunch' with unlimited cocktails from 10am, with an extended happy hour in place until 8pm.</p>

<p>Announcing the updated hours on Twitter, it said: 'Guess we'll just have to start a little bit earlier then Boris...'  </p>

<p>Other establishments have also encouraged drinkers to start their night earlier, teasing drinks and dinner offers on social media. </p>

<p>Source Bar at the University of Central Lancashire, in Preston, said: 'Don't forget! New coronavirus restrictions mean we'll be closing at 10pm every evening.</p>

<p>'So head down early with your housemates to check out our dinner and drinks deals!' </p>

<p>The Drapers Arms in Hackney, London, also put out a call to drinkers.  </p>

<p>'Our booking system remains open until 9pm,' it said last night. 'Apart from anything else we remain a pub and you are still welcome to come and just have a drink.</p>

<p>'We've got a few bottles that would struggle to last 59 minutes. I also think if you walk in, sit down and order a steak and a glass we could get that done.' </p>

<p>Revellers who headed out to enjoy a few drinks were turfed out of pubs and restaurants across England last night as the country's first 10pm pub and restaurant curfew began.</p>

<p>Chairs and tables were left empty after customers enjoying drinks with friends on outside tables in Soho, central London, were told to 'get out to help out' by hospitality staff.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police officers including Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick enforced the new coronavirus restrictions, as bar and restaurant staff cleared tables and chairs off the streets before 10pm.</p>

<p>Others enjoyed a drink at pub beer gardens in London Bridge while for others the restrictions caused a few cancellations as revellers feared their meals would be cut short.</p>

<p>The strict measures were imposed by the Government this week amid Tory backbench fears that Mr Johnson was gearing up for a second national lockdown. </p>

<p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist, who is leading the Met's response to the pandemic, said: 'The vast majority of Londoners have stuck to the rules and responded positively to the unprecedented situation we are in. We thank them for that.</p>

<p>'Throughout the last few months we have continued to step in where necessary to protect the public, even as the rules relaxed, with officers working hard to tackle challenging incidents such as unlicensed music events throughout the summer – sometimes facing extreme hostility and even violence. In many cases we worked proactively and successfully ahead these events to prevent them from happening in the first place.</p>

<p>'However, it is clear that there is a renewed need for everyone to do everything they can to minimise the risk of transmission of what is a potentially deadly disease - that means everyone following the rules. Our officers will help people do that and will explain to the public what those regulations are, however, they will also be firm and take appropriate action against those that simply refuse to follow the law and who are deliberately placing communities at risk.</p>

<p>'We urge the public to continue to report serious breaches to us via the 101 telephone system or using our online reporting system. However, we should all bear in mind that there are a number of exemptions to the rules which may apply to any situation so an apparent breach may not be what it appears and not every call may generate an immediate police response.</p>

<p>'Additionally, demands on the Met from crime, non-Covid related anti-social behaviour and protests are returning to pre-Covid levels so we will continue to respond to these alongside the pandemic in order to keep Londoners safe.' </p>

<p>Just hours after the announcement was made by the Prime Minister on Tuesday, food establishments slowly recovering from months of lockdown were faced with a wave of cancellations from concerned customers.</p>

<p>George Madgwick, 30, who runs The Wicks Bistro, in Cosham, near Portsmouth, told MailOnline that he quickly had eight cancellations from worried diners who booked late-evening tables.</p>

<p>Mr Madgwick, who started up in February, said: 'People don't want to rush and are worried because it's not last orders at 10pm, it's everyone out the door at 10pm. It's taken away our ability to do three sittings in a night. </p>

<p>'Around 50 per cent of our business comes in at 7.30pm and we get around 20-25 per cent for 5pm tables, so the 8.45pm tables is about 20-25 per cent of our nightly business.</p>

<p>'We've already had eight cancellations since the announcement and in the last 24 hours we have had zero bookings after 8.30pm, when we would normally have three or four.'</p>

<p>Mr Madgwick said the cost to the business could be around £300-a-nigh, but added that the biggest impact of the curfew will be on his staff. He said: 'Instead of working until 11.30pm everything has to close at 10pm so it will be more like 10.15pm, which is an hour and a quarter less hours every day.'  </p>

<p>On Tuesday the Prime Minister set out a raft of measures designed to clampdown on the virus, which has so far claimed more than 40,000 lives and infected more than 400,000 people in the UK.</p>

<p>As well as the curfew, which Mr Johnson is adamant that premises must follow and kick out all of their customers by the cut off point, the hospitality sector will also be restricted to table service only as the Government outlawed drinkers making a trip to the bar.</p>

<p>All retail workers and customers in indoor hospitality settings will be required to wear masks - except when they are seated to eat or drink - while all workers who can work from home are now being encouraged to do so from tomorrow.</p>

<p>Fines for breaking the rule of six and for failing to wear a face covering are increasing to £200 for a first offence.</p>

<p>The police will now have the option of asking the military for support with soldiers potentially being drafted in to guard protected sites in order to allow officers more time to crackdown on rule-breakers.</p>

<p>Members of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the curfew would not be enough to slow the rate of infection.</p>

<p>But Mr Johnson insisted his approach was based on trying to 'balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods'.         </p>
