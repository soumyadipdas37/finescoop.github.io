<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert will be forced to choose between Irena Srbinovska and Bella Varelis on Thursday night.</p>

<p>But a dramatic teaser for the finale shows the 30-year-old confidently confessing his love for both women on their final dates together.</p>

<p>Bachelor fans have slammed Locky for telling both Bella and Irena he's falling in love with them and labelled him as 'immature'.</p>

<p>'He is emotionally immature!' The Bachelor fans have turned on Locky Gilbert (pictured) just hours before the finale after he told both women he loves them in a dramatic new teaser</p>

<p>'I don't agree with his telling them both he loves them pretty silly poor girls heading for heartbreak,' one person wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'To be honest - I would not want a man who was in love with another woman at the same time as me – and struggled to chose between us,' another person wrote.</p>

<p>Another agreed: 'It's not true soul love if you are in love with two women. True love is the one and only, Locky is the emotionally immature one, not the girls.'</p>

<p>'Locky is in love with the idea of being in love. Being in love with two people is not real love. He has no idea what being in love is. I couldn't be with someone who isn't solely in love with me,' one person said.</p>

<p>'He has no idea what being in love is!' Bachelor fans have slammed Locky for telling Bella and Irena he's falling in love with them and labelled him as 'immature'</p>

<p>'Telling them both he was in love is so cringeworthy. So now one leaves more hurt due to false hope. The other wins knowing he loves another woman. Sounds like a lose lose situation to me and utterly selfish thing to do,' another commented.</p>

<p>In the dramatic trailer for Thursday night's finale, Locky breaks down in tears as he's forced to make the heart-breaking decision to let one person go and pick his winner.</p>

<p>The decision is even more difficult given that the 30-year-old confidently tells both beauties that he's falling in love with them on their final dates together. </p>

<p>Locky tells the cameras: 'I thought I would come here and meet one person that I like and then end up together. But I found two!</p>

<p>'They are two of the most incredible women that I've ever met in my entire life.' </p>

<p>A short scene in the teaser also shows Locky telling a delighted Irena: 'I have fallen in love with you' - before he utters the same words to Bella on their own date. </p>
