<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two Icelandic women who spent the night with football stars Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden at the England team hotel insist they paid for their rooms themselves.</p>

<p>Model Nadia Sif Lindal Gunnarsdottir, 20, and her cousin Lara Clausen, 19, booked two rooms at the Saga Radisson Blu hotel, in Reykjavik, to meet the stars hours after their match with Iceland.</p>

<p>Nadia told MailOnline: ‘We got into the hotel because we had booked and paid for the rooms ourselves. It’s been said that the players paid for us or that we were smuggled into the Radisson by an inside man.</p>

<p>‘But we booked the rooms ourselves and had as much right as any paying guest to stay there.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile the hotel manager Ingibjörg Ólafsdóttir today denied that any employees received payment from the players.</p>

<p>‘It is not right,’ she said. ‘I say no more. But the English national team knows that this is not right.’</p>

<p>Nadia previously told MailOnline how she had been chatting with young Manchester United star Greenwood, 18, for a 'couple of days' before he and fellow England starlet Foden visited Iceland for a Nations League game. </p>

<p>Nadia brought friend and cousin Lara Clausen (left) to meet the two England stars. Nadia (right), a 19-year-old law student from Iceland, said the pair felt 'very, very, very bad' about the situation</p>

<p>The two girls (Nadia pictured right with her cousin and friend Lara left) pictured on the night they went to the England team's hotel to meet the young stars, who both made their debuts for the national team against Iceland on Saturday</p>

<p>They were among at least four local women who flirted with the players and discussed going to their hotel, though not all of the women did so. </p>

<p>The Three Lions pair, who both made their England debut in the game against Iceland on Saturday, sneaked Nadia and her cousin Lara Clausen, a 19-year-old law student, into the team hotel.</p>

<p>The beauty queen claimed the pair had never even heard of Foden, 20, before the trip – but that the four of them spent the evening getting to know each other and enjoyed a 'good night' together.  </p>

<p>When asked how close they came to the stars during the evening, Nadia declined to comment and would only say ‘they were perfect gentlemen’. </p>

<p>She told MailOnline: 'We met online. I was talking to Mason for a couple of days before they came to Iceland.' And she added: 'They did not book the rooms. We did, and paid for them ourselves.'</p>

<p>It comes after videos revealed how the England stars had engaged in suggestive chat with at least four Icelandic girls, discussing the idea of them joining the footballers in their hotel.</p>

<p>One of the girls, Anita Gunnarsdottir, admitted being filmed flirting with the players with a friend, but insisted that she had decided not to go to their hotel. 'I didn't meet them. I'm not one of the girls who went to the hotel,' she said.</p>

<p>The footage emerged hours after England manager Gareth Southgate confirmed the pair had been kicked out of the squad after they were filmed meeting with girls in the team hotel in Iceland - breaking strict coronavirus quarantine rules.</p>

<p>This is the moment England stars Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden engage in a flighty chat with Icelandic girls</p>

<p>The young stars, who made their debut for England against Iceland on Saturday, did not travel with their team-mates to Denmark on Monday after footage emerged of the pair in a hotel room with the girls.</p>

<p>Foden: 'Say that again, what was you saying?'</p>

<p>Girl: 'What's the plan?'</p>

<p>Foden: 'What's the plan?'</p>

<p>Girl: 'Mhmm'</p>

<p>Foden: '(To Mason) Mason what's the plan?'</p>

<p>Mason: 'Depends what you want'</p>

<p>Foden: 'He says depends what do you want?'</p>

<p>Girl: 'We can come to the hotel but I don't know how you're going to sneak us in'</p>

<p>Foden: 'What you coming to the hotel for?'</p>

<p>Mason: 'What do you think?'</p>

<p>Foden: What does she want?'</p>

<p>Girl: 'Yeah, what do you think bro?'</p>

<p>Girl:(Speaks In Icelandic to her friend)</p>

<p>Mason and Foden: Discussing. Hard to tell what they are saying.</p>

<p>Foden: 'Have you got a mate?'</p>

<p>Girl: What?</p>

<p>Foden: 'Your friend?'</p>

<p>Girl: Yeah</p>

<p>The pair will instead fly home separately from the rest of the England team, back to Manchester.  </p>

<p>On Monday, Nadia apologised for her part in the incident, saying she felt 'really really bad'. </p>

<p>She told MailOnline: 'I feel really sorry for them and I never wanted to put them in that position. But we didn't know any better, and we didn't know that they were quarantining, or else we wouldn't have gone to meet them.</p>

<p>'We didn't even know who Phil was. I asked Phil who he was. I'm not that much into football. I don't watch football at all.</p>

<p>'We didn't even know that Mason played for Man United.'</p>

<p>She added: 'We haven't spoken to them since. We don't want to interrupt them because they are of course going through a lot right now. They haven't contacted us.</p>

<p>'It was a good night that we had, of course. We were all the four of us spending time together and getting to know each other. They were really nice guys.'</p>

<p>Lara added: 'They were just young. We were all young and stupid and we all make mistakes. They treated us really well. They were such gentlemen. Really nice guys.'  </p>

<p>Reports of the hotel meeting came after Greenwood and Foden both made their debuts in England's 1-0 away win against Iceland in the Nations League on Saturday. </p>

<p>England manager Gareth Southgate earlier confirmed the pair will travel home separately from the rest of the team.</p>

<p>The national team arrived in Iceland having been given an exemption from the country's quarantine rules, which mean all foreign travellers have to quarantine for 14 days - regardless of how long their stay in the country is.</p>

<p>Instead, Gareth Southgate's men were banned from meeting anyone outside of their bubble and were only allowed to go to their training facilities and the match while in the country. </p>

<p>A Snapchat clip released by DV appears to show England youngsters Phil Foden (pictured) and Mason Greenwood in a hotel room with female company</p>

<p>The meeting took place at the Radisson Blu hotel in Reykjavik, Iceland, where the England team were staying. The FA say the incident did not take part in any of the hotel rooms which the team were staying in</p>

<p>The four star rated hotel costs around £100-a-night and is around a 15-minute-drive, or around 5km away from Iceland's national stadium</p>

<p>Phil Foden (left) and Mason Greenwood are both heading home after breaking quarantine rules, Gareth Southgate has confirmed </p>

<p>Foden and Greenwood (pictured with Gareth Southgate) made their senior debuts this week. Southgate said the pair would fly home separately from the rest of the squad</p>

<p>Foden, above with Man City boss Pep Guardiola, has a one-year-old son and a girlfriend who he has been in a long term relationship with</p>

<p>Iceland has strict rules on quarantines for incoming travellers.</p>

<p>As of August 19, all travellers from risk areas to Iceland that enter the country are obligated to go into a 14 day quarantine.</p>

<p>This is regardless of duration of the intended stay in Iceland or purpose of the visit. </p>

<p>It can be shortened by undergoing  testing for COVID-19 on arrival and again on day five of the quarantine.</p>

<p>But the England team struck up a deal with Icelandic authorities so the team could play their Nations League clash with Iceland on Saturday.</p>

<p>As part of the rules, the England team were told to isolate in the hotel, only leaving to go to training and matches.</p>

<p>The pair's conduct in bringing girls back has also contravened the FA's behavioural rules for players whilst on international duty.</p>

<p>In the short clip, Foden and Greenwood appear to be wearing their new England training wear and the players are now in hot water with management.</p>

<p>In an interview with DV, one of the girls in the Snapchat video allegedly filmed in the hotel room said: 'We had no idea about these [Covid-19] rules, they never said we could not take pictures.'</p>

<p>Another girl claimed to have notified the England stars that the pictures were in circulation with a Snapchat message, but 'they have not opened it'.</p>

<p>She also claimed to have been talking 'with one of the boys for a few days'.</p>

<p>She said: 'The only thing I can say is that I had been talking to one of them for a few days. I'm not going to say where.'</p>

<p>Foden has a two-year-old son and a long-term girlfriend, while United star Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend back in May. </p>

<p>Manchester City midfielder Foden started for Gareth Southgate's side against Iceland on Saturday night, making his senior international debut.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Greenwood, who starred for Manchester United at the end of the recent Premier League season, came off the bench to achieve the same accolade.</p>

<p>While the pair would have been looking ahead to England's next fixture against Denmark in Copenhagen on Tuesday night, they will now leave Iceland and return home. </p>

<p>United's Mason Greenwood broke up with his model girlfriend Harriet Robson back in May. The pair are pictured here together</p>

<p>City star Foden, who is thought of as a hot prospect for the future, regularly posts pictures with his young son, who turned one back in January</p>

<p>Greenwood, who is also a highly regarded youngster at his club Manchester United, is pictured in training on Sunday, will head back to Manchester United on Monday</p>

<p>Foden was all smiles on Sunday but is now leaving the camp under a dark cloud this week following the revelation of the quarantine breach</p>

<p>England's senior stars trained on Monday morning, but Foden and Greenwood were absent. The team are set to face Denmark in their next match</p>

<p>The likes of James Ward-Prowse (centre) and Jack Grealish (left) were in high spirits on Monday, ahead of the Denmark game</p>

<p>The pair were both absent from England training on Monday and it was then confirmed that they would leave the camp and travel home before the team's second and final match.</p>

<p>England boss Gareth Southgate faced the media for a press conference on Monday where he discussed the issue.</p>

<p>He said: 'Two of the boys have broken the Covid-19 guidelines, in terms of our secure bubble.</p>

<p>'We had to decide very quickly that they couldn't have any interaction with the rest of the team and wouldn't be able to train.</p>

<p>'Obviously they have been naive. We have dealt with it appropriately. I recognise their age but the whole world is dealing with this pandemic.</p>

<p>'Now they will have to travel back to England separately.'</p>

<p>He added: 'Nothing has happened in the areas we occupy in the hotel.'</p>

<p>It has been reported by news outlet DV that the girls did not go into the players' room, but instead two other rooms had been booked where the could meet the woman, who both reportedly from Iceland. </p>

<p>The news outlet reports that, at first, only one of the woman was going to meet Greenwood, before a friend of hers decided to go with her.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Greenwood's club, Manchester United, said they were 'disappointed'.</p>

<p>Greenwood (pictured left) is a rising star at Manchester United. The club have called his actions 'disappointing'. Foden (pictured right) is also highly rated by Manchester City. The club says the player's actions were 'totally inappropriate'</p>

<p>The spokesperson said: 'Manchester United are liaising with the Football Association and are disappointed with the actions of Mason Greenwood over this situation.'</p>

<p>A statement from City read: 'It is clear that Phil's actions were totally inappropriate.</p>

<p>'His behaviour not only directly contravenes strict guidelines related to Covid-19, but also falls well below the standard expected of a Manchester City player and England international.'</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the England national team tonight added: 'Whilst in Iceland, both Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood spent time outside of our private team area, which was a breach of our COVID-19 rules.</p>

<p>'While they did not leave the team hotel, it was an unacceptable breach of our protocol. They have both apologised for their serious lack of judgement.</p>

<p>'The FA will be launching a full investigation into the circumstances leading up to this breach.</p>

<p>'We have spoken to the Iceland FA to offer our apologies for this incident and to ensure them that we are taking the appropriate steps.</p>

<p>'We have also assured the Danish FA that all other players and staff members have been isolated within our group throughout this period.</p>

<p>'Our immediate priority now is preparing the team for the match against Denmark tomorrow.'</p>
