<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former Home and Away star accused of putting a policewoman in a headlock and punching her repeatedly has avoided a criminal trial and will be dealt with under the Mental Health Act. </p>

<p>Joel McIlroy allegedly punched a 29-year-old senior constable during a violent scuffle in Surry Hills, Sydney's inner-city, in October 2019 which resulted in the officer being taken to hospital.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old was originally charged with two counts of assaulting police, one of resisting police and one of wilfully obstructing an officer in the execution of their duty.</p>

<p>He was then additionally charged with assaulting an officer occasioning actual bodily harm, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of seven years in jail.  </p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Giles told Sydney's Downing Centre Local Court the Silver Logie nominee involved himself 'in an incident' which had 'absolutely nothing to do with him'.</p>

<p>Former Home and Away actor Joel Mcllroy is seen arriving at the Downing Centre District Court in Sydney on Wednesday</p>

<p> McIlroy appeared on Home and Away from 1994 to 2006, the year he was nominated for a Silver Logie as the most popular actor on Australian television. His character Flynn Saunders was married to Kate Ritchie's Sally Fletcher.  McIlroy and Ritchie are pictured together</p>

<p>Handing down her decision on Wednesday, Ms Giles said she really didn't want to grant the Section 32 application of the Mental Health Act but felt it more appropriate given his strong medical network and support.</p>

<p>'It is indeed a very serious incident of gratuitous, wanton, vengeful, probably even sexist violence by the defendant against the police when told by them to mind his own business and go away,' she said.</p>

<p>McIlroy was diagnosed with Huntington's disease in 2007, a rare degenerative brain condition.</p>

<p>Medical experts have given him about ten years left to live, five of which will be in care.</p>

<p>At the time of the alleged assault he was experiencing a significant decline in cognitive flexibility and had fallen into the severe range of depressive symptoms, the court heard.</p>

<p>On October 22 in 2019, McIlroy was wandering down Buckingham Street when he stumbled on two plain-clothed offices making an arrest over drug use.</p>

<p>After the former actor asked the quiet duo sitting in the gutter if they were 'OK', he asked the officers to identify themselves.</p>

<p>'How do I know you're police you're not in uniform?', he allegedly said, after seeing their badge and warrant cards, the court heard.</p>

<p>Told repeatedly to move on, he allegedly barged his shoulder into one constable before punching her head several times.</p>

<p>When the other female officer stepped in a scuffle ensued and he allegedly grabbed one officer around the neck and they all felll to the ground.</p>

<p>A concerned bystander, who allegedly witnessed McIlroy on top of one of the women and holding her around the neck, stepped in to assist.</p>

<p>McIlroy was eventually handcuffed but 'childishly' went deadweight and required four officers to lift him into their truck to be taken to Surry Hills police station. </p>

<p>Video of McIlroy's arrest allegedly showed him yelling during the struggle: 'I can't breathe' and 'get your hand off my face.'</p>

<p>'No one pretends the violence wasn't shameful or terrifying for both constables and the poor selfless community-minded gentleman who stepped in to assist the constables,' she said.</p>

<p>McIlroy, 47, allegedly punched a female senior constable multiple times as he intervened in the arrest of another man in Sydney's Surry Hills on October 22. He is pictured with fellow star Kate Ritchie, who played his wife in the long-running television series</p>

<p>Ms Giles said it was annoying the mental health application was made by his defence 11 months later, given McIlroy has suffered from Huntington's for over a decade.</p>

<p>McIlroy applied on Tuesday for five charges to be dealt with under Section 32 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. </p>

<p>'In a perfect world the police would not be assaulted and people would not have their brains die at 47,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Giles also pointed to the unusualness of the case, where McIlroy was said to be unfit for cross-examination in the witness box due to his cognitive degeneration.</p>

<p>'This is not a section 32 I wanted to grant, I tried to write the refusal decision most of yesterday,' she said.</p>

<p>But after reassurance from medical experts that treatment would preclude further offending, she deemed it appropriate to be dealt with under the act, rather than through the criminal law.</p>

<p>McIlroy appeared on Home and Away from 1994 to 2006, the year he was nominated for a Silver Logie as the most popular actor on Australian television.</p>

<p>His character Flynn Saunders was married to Kate Ritchie's Sally Fletcher. </p>

<p>McIlroy also appeared in television series Water Rats, All Saints, and Heartbreak High. </p>

<p>Huntington's disease is caused by the inheritance of an altered gene. </p>

<p>The death of brain cells in certain areas of the brain results in a gradual loss of cognitive, physical and emotional function. </p>

<p>Huntington's disease is a complex and severely debilitating disease, for which there is no cure.</p>

<p>The most common symptom is jerky movements of the arms and legs, known as 'chorea'. </p>

<p>Chorea usually starts as mild twitching and gradually increases over the years. </p>

<p>A person with Huntington's disease may also have difficulties with speech, swallowing and concentration.</p>

<p>Someone with Huntington's disease may live for 15 to 25 years after developing the first symptoms.</p>
