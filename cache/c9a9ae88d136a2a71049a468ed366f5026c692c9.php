<p>Davis, who won an Oscar for 2016's Fences, told the NY Times that Boseman had poured himself fully into the role.</p>

<p>'An actor of Chadwick's status usually comes on and it's their ego who comes on before them: This is what they want, this is what they're not going to do,' the actress, 55, explained.</p>

<p>'That was absolutely, 150 percent off the table with Chadwick. He could completely discard whatever ego he had, whatever vanity he had, and welcome Levee in.'</p>

<p>Director George C. Wolfe has previously described making the movie with Boseman as 'a glorious experience.' </p>

<p>'Everyday we all got to witness the ferocity of his talent and the gentleness of his heart. A truly blessed, loving, gifted and giving human being,' Wolfe declared.</p>

<p>Boseman had continued to pursue his acting career despite his diagnosis and had undergone treatment while starring as Marvel's Black Panther.</p>

<p>He also completed work on 21 Bridges, released in November 2019, and Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods, released in June, before his death on August 28. </p>

<p>Recently, his 21 Bridges co-star Sienna Miller revealed that Boseman, who also served as a producer on the movie, had stepped in when the studio refused to meet her salary demand for the project.</p>

<p>'This was a pretty big budget film, and I know that everybody understands about the pay disparity in Hollywood, but I asked for a number that the studio wouldn't get to,' Miller, 38, told Empire magazine. 'And because I was hesitant to go back to work and my daughter was starting school and it was an inconvenient time, I said: 'I'll do it if I'm compensated in the right way.''</p>

<p>She added: 'And Chadwick ended up donating some of his salary to get me to the number that I had asked for. He said that that was what I deserved to be paid.'  </p>

<p>Miller described the gesture as 'testament' to Boseman's character and said she couldn't imagine any other man in Hollywood 'behaving that graciously or respectfully'.  </p>

<p>Paid tribute: In an interview with Empire magazine, published Monday, Sienna Miller revealed her 21 Bridges co-star Chadwick Boseman had supplemented her pay from his own salary </p>

<p>Gracious star: Miller said: 'Chadwick ended up donating some of his salary to get me to the number that I had asked for. He said that that was what I deserved to be paid'</p>

<p>R.I.P.: Boseman had also completed work on Spike Lee's Da 5 Bloods before his untimely death. The movie was released on Netflix in June before his untimely death</p>
