<p>Jason John Nixon, 50, was handed an indefinite prison sentence in 2004 after killing two fellow inmates at the Brisbane Correctional Centre in the city's southwest.  </p>

<p>He also gained infamy for breaking out of the maximum security unit and attempting to murder one of the detectives who recaptured him, The Courier Mail reported.   </p>

<p>Convicted murderer Jason John Nixon (pictured), 50, faced Brisbane Magistrate's Court on Monday after throwing his own faeces at two prison guards last October </p>

<p>Nixon, who earned his nickname 'Waxy' because of his love of surfing, beat fellow inmate Bart Vosmaer to death with gym weights as part of a group murder in 1993.  </p>

<p>He broke out of the prison alongside 'Postcard Bandit' Brenden Abbott in 1997 and fired at shotgun at the detective who recaptured him at a luxury Sunshine Coast resort. </p>

<p>Nixon was hit with his indefinite jail term after brutally killing double murderer Mark Day in the prison exercise yard in 2003.  </p>

<p>Nixon has since faced court over a number of assaults on prison guards and appeared in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Monday. </p>

<p>He appeared via video link from jail and pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawfully assaulting prison guards last October.  </p>

<p>Police prosecutor Lauren Collins said Nixon had moved to the back of his cell before throwing faeces at the two correctional officers who delivered his lunch. </p>

<p>'At approximately 12.05pm on October 29, 2019 the victims were delivering lunches to the prisoners within the correctional centre,' Sergeant Collins said.</p>

<p>Nixon infamously murdered two fellow inmates and has also escaped from the Brisbane Correctional Centre (pictured) </p>

<p>'The defendant has taken his food box and then rushed back towards the open hatch and has thrown faeces at the victims hitting them on the chest and face area.' </p>

<p>Sergeant Collins also said Nixon had six pages of 'detestable criminal history' and similar offences. </p>

<p>The incidents included Nixon throwing urine at a jail nurse and leaving a 20cm gouge in a guard's arm after attacking him with a razor blade.</p>

<p>Magistrate Penelope Hay said Nixon's offending was serious and urged him to consider his eligibility for parole in 2034. </p>

<p>Nixon told Magistrate Hay he had 'nothing to say about it'. </p>

<p>'It's all over. Thanks for being optimistic though, Judge,' he said. </p>

<p>The 50-year-old was sentenced to two years imprisonment on top of his indefinite sentence.  </p>
