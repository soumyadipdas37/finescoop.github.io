<p>Evelyn and Justin appeared on season two of the hit TLC series, 90 Day Fiance.</p>

<p>The couple met during the World Games in Santiago de Cali, Colombia, when Justin ran into Evelyn standing in line for a hot dog.</p>

<p>'I saw a beautiful girl standing in line, so I used my Spanish to say "Hola," and she kind of laughed and smiled.</p>

<p>'Latin women are more passionate. There was an instant spark, for the next seven days I don't think she left my side one time. Three months later I ended up going back to Colombia to see if this romance was real.</p>
