<p>Tech multinational IBM has handed back $12million to its Australian employees after underpaying them for eight years</p>

<p>The company failed to apply more than 15 award entitlements and conditions. These included vehicle allowances, superannuation entitlements and annual leave loading.</p>

<p>A significant number of casuals at IBM's Ballarat contact centre were also paid the national minimum wage, instead of higher rates under the relevant award.</p>
