<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Duchess of Cornwall went back to school today in a bid to highlight child literacy.</p>

<p>Wearing a Fiona Clare dress and matching mask, Camilla, 73, was greeted by year three students at Ivydale Primary School on their third day back in class and was even treated to a cheeky joke.</p>

<p>Prince Charles' wife, who has been the patron of the National Literacy Trust since 2010 seemed delighted to travel to the school in order to open its new library and launch the Trust's virtual library at Ivydale. </p>

<p>Keeping her distance as to respect social distancing guidelines, and wearing a mask, she first met with school staff and teachers. </p>

<p>Back to school! The Duchess of Cornwall, 73, travelled to Nunhead in South London to open the Ivydale Primary School's library. She met with its pupils and staff </p>

<p>Camilla took an interest in what two of the pupils were working on during her visit of Ivydale </p>

<p>Beaming youngsters eagerly pointed out their favourite books lining the shelves of a new school library funded entirely by parents.</p>

<p>The Duchess also recorded a secret message which will feature on the National Literacy Trust’s Virtual School Library, when it is launched online on Monday.</p>

<p>Arriving at the school and met by headteacher Helen Ingham, she said: 'It is very nice to be out about.'</p>

<p>Wearing a navy and white silk print dress the Duchess spoke to children as they did their schoolwork outside and explained their drawings.</p>

<p>Camilla wore the silk dress with a pair of cream shoes with a sensible heel and a tote bag with bamboo handles </p>

<p>Inside the main hall, Chris Smith, of BBC Radio One Newsbeat, read a poem created by children based on his book The Hope-o-potamus.</p>

<p>The newsreader, who penned the poem and co-authored the Kid Normal series with Breakfast Show host Greg James, welcomed the duchess to the school.</p>

<p>And raised a smile from the Duchess after clips of jokes written and created by children from around the country were played on a giant screen in the main school hall.</p>

<p>Camilla watched quietly as Year 3 pupils talked with her about their favourite books during a literacy workshop today </p>

<p>Upon her arrival, the Duchess of Cornwall was wearing a mask, which she took off during the visit </p>

<p>One of the cheeky pupils, Toby, of Scarborough, got the biggest laugh joking: ‘Who goes to the toilet at a party? A party pooper.’</p>

<p>The joke project from children around the country had been inspired by the Incredible Joke Instant Joke Creating Machine by Susie Day.</p>

<p>Many of the children, aged seven and eight-years-old, have been off school during the pandemic.</p>

<p>They sat with the Duchess in the new school library designed and funded by parents and pointed out their favourite books.</p>

<p>Camilla said: 'I would like to welcome you all back. It must be nice to be back in school after so long.'</p>

<p>The Duchess also privately recorded a video message to launch the National Literacy Trust’s Virtual School Library which will be broadcast on 14th September.</p>

<p>The school unveiled a new library with mezzanine level built after three years of fundraising.</p>

<p>A playful gust of wind ruffled the Duchess' hair as she arrived at the school in Nunhead this afternoon</p>

<p>The Duchess of Cornwall met with year three pupils during her visit and attended a poetry reading at the school's library</p>

<p>Pupils were gathered in the school's great hall during the Duchess' visit, where funny clips were shown on a wide screen</p>

<p>Camilla took the time to speak to several of the year three pupils present in the school's playground </p>

<p>Parents were drafted in to help with the architecture, painting and decorating and even the soft furnishings and cataloguing books.</p>

<p>Books were donated by families and publishers, including Penguin Random House and HarperCollins, Rye Books, a local independent bookshop.</p>

<p>The National Literacy Trust says ten per cent of schools do not have a library and a quarter of all children did not have access to books of their own or library books during lockdown.</p>

<p>The trust will on Monday launch its Virtual School Library providing a weekly author or illustrator sharing a free ebook or audiobook.</p>

<p>Camilla was greeted by school headteacher Helen Ingham who introduced us to the members of staff present </p>

<p>Fiona Evans, director of Social Programmes at the National Literacy Trust, said: 'School libraries will play a vital role in supporting the literacy, learning and wellbeing of all children as they return to school after such a significant disruption to their education.</p>

<p>'Ivydale Primary School’s brand-new school library was the perfect setting for our Patron HRH The Duchess of Cornwall to launch our new Virtual School Library which will ensure that children have access to the magical world of stories all year round.'</p>

<p>Children’s author Chris Smith said: 'As children go back to school after such a difficult few months, we’ve got to do everything we can to help them take their next steps forward.</p>

<p>The Duchess sat down with pupils in their school's new library for some poetry reading this afternoon    </p>

<p>Camilla listened intently during the reading in the new library which was funded by pupils' parents</p>

<p>Pupils were encouraged to share their favourite books with the Duchess during her visit this afternoon</p>

<p>The headteacher welcomed The Duchess of Cornwall's visit and said she hoped the new library would 'inspire children at Ivydale Primary School to fall in love with reading for decades to come'  </p>

<p>'And stories can be a massive help with that process. A great story can be a comfort, an inspiration or an escape – and the place where these magical treasures can be found at school is that wonderful place called the library.</p>

<p>'It was fantastic to join Her Royal Highness today to launch not one but two brand-new school libraries. The first is a spectacular space, filled with books and displays that will inspire children at Ivydale Primary School to fall in love with reading for decades to come.</p>

<p>'The second is a new virtual school library from the National Literacy Trust which will bring the magic of stories to all primary school children across the UK at a time when they need them most.</p>

<p>'Greg and I can’t wait to be the first guest virtual school librarians – we’ve got some brilliant stories and fun-filled activities up our sleeves.'</p>

<p>Helen Ingham, headteacher at Ivydale Primary School, said: 'Our new school library is spectacular.</p>

<p>'We wanted to create a space that would inspire our pupils, staff and the wider community to fall in love with reading, and we’ve achieved that and so much more.</p>

<p>'All corners of the community came together in a three-year mission to fundraise for the school library and to give their time and expertise to help bring it to life.</p>

<p>'I am so grateful to our incredible parents and PTA, publishers including Penguin Random House, HarperCollins, Walker Books and Pan Macmillan, and local independent bookshops Rye Books and Tales on Moon Lane for making today possible.</p>

<p>'It was an absolute honour for Her Royal Highness to open our new school library. It has been a truly special day that our children will never forget.'</p>
