<p>Coronavirus has claimed the lives of one million people worldwide since the outbreak emerged in China late last year</p>

<p>The figure comes a day after the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned that then global coronavirus death toll could hit two million before an effective vaccine is widely used. </p>

<p>Six months after coronavirus was first detected at a Wuhan wet market in December 2016, the global death toll had claimed at least 500,000 lives. In half that time, the known death toll is now believed to have doubled.  </p>

<p>The true number of deaths and infections are likely to be significantly higher due to insufficient testing and reporting in many countries. </p>
