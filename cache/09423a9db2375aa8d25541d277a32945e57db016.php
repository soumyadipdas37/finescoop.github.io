<p>Though the Inamorata designer seemed to be carefree, the outing comes pretty fresh off the release of her bombshell essay titled Buying Myself Back.  </p>

<p>The Cut: Emily wrote an essay called Buying Myself Back where she detailed her journey starting out as a model and alleges sexual misconduct against photographer Jonathan Leder</p>

<p> Image: In her own words Emily talks about starting out in the modeling world and what it means to feel powerless over your own image </p>

<p>In the essay, Emily talks about not having control over her own image as a model as well as power struggles between artist and subject. </p>

<p>In detailing some of her personal experiences on the path to stardom, Emily notably reveals disturbing details surrounding a photoshoot in the Catskills with photographer Jonathan Leder in 2012. </p>

<p>At the time the young model was an unknown and was told by her agent that the shoot would be good for her image. </p>

<p>The model bought a train ticket and prepared for an overnight photoshoot at Leder's private home upstate before ending up in a situation she had not asked for. </p>

<p>Upon arrival, the model alleges that she was plied with copious amounts of red wine before a nude photoshoot, eventually losing consciousness to wake up with 'his fingers suddenly inside of [her]'. </p>

<p>Under fire: Jonathan Leder is now under fire after the release of Emily's essay. His publishing company has issued statements on his behalf calling the model 'vindictive' and claiming her allegations are false</p>

<p>Gone Girl: Leder chose to publish her polaroids in a book costing $80, some of which were 'the most revealing and vulgar' photos after Emily started to gain success after the movie Gone Girl</p>

<p>Years later after Emily had reached fame, Leder chose to publish her Polaroids in a book costing $80, some of which were 'the most revealing and vulgar' photos from their 2012 shoot. </p>

<p>The situation left Emily fearing for her career and feeling violated, as she watched her book of nudes sell out three times over. </p>

<p>The incident sparked legal dealings as Emily said she never once gave her consent for any images to be published, as the opposing sides battled it out in 2016.  </p>

<p>Lawyers for Leder and Imperial publishing maintained their innocence, saying:</p>

<p> 'We do not feel that we should be bullied by a celebrity though, and cease publication because she has decided that the photographs are no longer in her best interest.'</p>

<p>They added that they had 'every legal right to publish [their] books'.</p>

<p>Vindictive: Leder's team alleges that all claims were falsified in a desperate ploy; Emily pictured in March 2020</p>

<p>Emily revealed that even four years later she still contemplates selling a portrait of herself from Richard Prince - an image she also felt no ownership of - to use the money to sue Jonathan. </p>

<p>After her revealing essay, Leder and his publishing company have retorted back, calling the A-list celebrity 'vindictive'.</p>

<p>In their defending statement's Jonathan's team went on the record to say, 'Mr. Leder totally denies her outrageous allegations of being 'assaulted.' It is grotesque and sad that she is so vindictive to lie in such a way to the press routinely.'</p>

<p>Since then he has gone completely rogue, deactivating his social media amidst the unfolding scandal. </p>

<p>Owning herself: Emily revealed that even four years later she still contemplates selling a portrait of herself, to use the money to sue Jonathan for his wrongdoings</p>
