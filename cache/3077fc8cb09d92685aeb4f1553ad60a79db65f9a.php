<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brad Pitt took his new rumoured girlfriend, 27-year-old model Nicole Poturalski, to Chateau Miraval in the south of France this week.</p>

<p>The move seemed calculated as almost exactly six years ago, the 56-year-old actor wed his estranged wife Angelina Jolie there. Their wedding anniversary is August 23, 2014.</p>

<p>And on Wednesday a source told UsWeekly that the Oscar-winning Troy actor simply doesn't care if the Maleficent actress gets so angry that she retaliates.</p>

<p>Nice going: Brad Pitt took his new 'girlfriend' Nicole Poturalski to Chateau Miraval in the south of France recently</p>

<p>Painful: The chateau is where Brad and Angeline Jolie wed in 2014. In fact, it is very close to their wedding anniversary date which was August 23</p>

<p>'Taking Nicole to Miraval on their former wedding anniversary, Brad knows exactly what he is doing and the reaction it’s going to get from Angelina,' a source told the site.</p>

<p>'He just doesn’t care if Angelina is going to lash out. He expects she will.'</p>

<p>Brad and Angelina were married at the Chateau Miraval, located in the village of Correns, just over six years ago.</p>

<p>The intimate ceremony was only attended by a handful of guests and their six children: Maddox, 19, Pax, 16, Zahara, 15, Shiloh, 14, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 12.</p>

<p>The couple filed for divorce in 2016, and they're still engaged in an ongoing custody battle.</p>

<p>She may stroke back: On Wednesday a source told UsWeekly that the Oscar-winning Troy actor simply doesn't care if the Maleficent actress gets so angry that she retaliates; seen in London in 2019</p>

<p>According to E! News, Pitt and his lady friend landed in France in late August. Nicole is reportedly staying with Brad while he's at the vineyard over the weekend.</p>

<p>According to a local, Brad is visiting Miraval because he's 'participating in a campaign for his wine.'</p>

<p>The chateau, which he and Angelina purchased in 2011 for $60 million, is famous for its wines, especially its rosé. He also just launched a champagne.</p>

<p>The rumored couple were spotted exactly one week ago - August 26 - as they stepped off a private plane in the south of France, after flying from LAX in Los Angeles to the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, before transferring.</p>

<p>Pitt likes the bubbly: According to a local, Brad is visiting Miraval because he's 'participating in a campaign for his wine.' The chateau, which he and Angelina purchased in 2011 for $60 million, is famous for its wines, especially its rosé</p>

<p>'They were kissing and Brad was being super attentive to her,' a source told OK! magazine. 'He was in a semi public place but didn’t seem to mind people seeing him. She’s a real beauty and obviously a lot younger than him.'</p>

<p>The model's husband: The beauty reportedly has an open marriage with husband Roland Mary, seen  in 2015</p>

<p>Most recently, the Tomb Raider actress moved to have the judge overseeing her divorce trial removed due to business dealings he has with one of Brad's lawyers.</p>

<p>She's also reportedly considering moving with the children to the UK, which would make it considerably more difficult for her ex to spend time with the kids. </p>

<p>Although Brad's potential relationship with Nicole is only now drawing widespread attention, the two may have been together for as long as nine months.</p>

<p>They were first spotted together in November during a performance of Kanye West's opera Nebuchadnezzar at the Hollywood Bowl.</p>

<p>The bombshell, who has a son, has graced the cover of ELLE and is currently signed to Next Management in Los Angeles and A Management in Germany.</p>

<p>She's also married to Berlin-based restaurateur Roland Mary, with whom she's allegedly in an open relationship.</p>

<p>The timeline also raises the possibility that the multi-lingual model may have been leaving messages for the Tree Of Life star on her Instagram.</p>

<p>Her last post: The siren was in a mint green bikini as she posed on a beach saying she missed summer in this Wednesday post</p>

<p>Beachy babe: And before that, the runway veteran was seen in a pink Polo hat near the shore</p>

<p>'Missing my strolls with my Love,' she captioned a since-deleted post from February.</p>

<p>She followed it up with another post from March, which she captioned, 'Saturdays these days for me is self-reflection, reading books spending time with my better half.'</p>

<p>So far, the two have stayed quiet about a possible relationship.</p>

<p>In December, Brad shut down most rumors about his dating life during an interview with The New York Times.</p>

<p>'People always say they don't read about themselves. I never believe it,' he said. 'I don't go out of my way to avoid it; I just don't seek it out. I don't know how many women they've said I've been dating the last two or three years, and none of it's true.'</p>

<p>The Hollywood hunk previously shot down rumors that he was dating Arrested Development's Alia Shawkat.</p>
