<p>Explaining the impact Richarlison had on his negotiations with the club, Allan said: 'I talk a lot with Richarlison when we're together with the national team and, during the negotiations to come to Everton, he kept asking me "When are you coming? We need you here, come here."'</p>

<p>'To hear that from someone like Richarlison was really satisfying. It makes you feel that you're important, that you're wanted. That's something I appreciate and I'll do everything to help him on the pitch.' </p>
