<p>As thousands prepared to start the new term, the president of the National Union of Students said the Government was 'gambling' with students' lives.</p>

<p>In Manchester, it emerged that 1,700 students under lockdown are unable to even find out if they have Covid-19.</p>

<p>The undergraduates self-isolating for a fortnight at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) have been told they cannot leave the campus to visit the local testing centre, leading to fears the outbreak will spread.</p>

<p>The Manchester outbreak is just one of at least 36 at universities across Britain.</p>

<p>Labour education spokesman Kate Green last night called on ministers to stop students from returning to university for the start of the academic year – affecting 2.3 million in the UK. </p>

<p>She said they should either delay the start of term or 'pause' the return of students to university campuses where courses had not started. </p>

<p>Backing Miss Green, NUS president Larissa Kennedy told The Guardian the union was demanding 'a functional test-and-trace system in place on campuses and adequate funding to tackle the student mental health crisis'.</p>

<p>Pressure is mounting on universities to refund tuition fees as thousands of students face lockdowns, online-only courses and the prospect of Christmas confined to their halls.</p>

<p>Tory MPs said it was 'madness' that the country's universities were charging the same fees for 'second-rate' learning.</p>

<p>As students face the prospect of being confined to their halls of residence over Christmas because of Covid-19 outbreaks on campuses, 3,000 students have already been locked down in their rooms after cases at 36 universities, including Glasgow, Manchester Metropolitan and Edinburgh Napier.</p>

<p>Last night Robert Halfon, the Conservative chairman of the education select committee, said students must be compensated for the lack of face-to-face learning.</p>

<p>The Department for Education said students who wanted refunds should appeal to their universities. Mr Halfon told the Daily Mail: 'If we have 3,000 students in lockdown now, it could be 6,000 next week, so ministers need to come up with a plan on testing and tracing.</p>

<p>'And we need to ensure students are back by Christmas, because a lockdown over Christmas would cause anguish for them and their families.</p>

<p>'The Government needs to seriously consider a discount, because when you pay for a product you should expect to get that product, and if not, you should get some money returned.' </p>

<p>Tory MP George Freeman said yesterday it was 'madness' that students were locked in halls of residences by universities 'still happily taking their money'.</p>

<p>He said on Twitter: 'How do I think universities make up the losses from offering student discounts? Well, not from fleecing students! Maybe from vice-chancellors' £300,000 salaries?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>But outgoing University of Buckingham vice-chancellor Sir Anthony Seldon said: 'We must have a sense of perspective. Universities have gone to huge lengths to plan for this and many are coping.'</p>

<p>And the Department for Education rejected Labour's call, insisting it was 'working closely with universities to support them to keep staff and students as safe as possible'.</p>

<p>The 1,700 MMU students in lockdown yesterday complained of feeling abandoned – with some already plotting their escape.</p>

<p>After 127 positive tests for Covid-19 on Friday, the shocked students – many of them freshers living away from home for the first time – were ordered to self-isolate in their halls of residence for a fortnight. </p>

<p>Desperate undergraduates said supplies of food and toiletries were low and complained of students holding all-night parties likened to 'prison riots'.</p>

<p>Some tried to ease the boredom by putting up signs in their windows with slogans including 'send drink' and 'f*** Boris'.</p>

<p>As some students in lockdown likened the university to a prison by labelling it 'HMP MMU', with security guards blocking them from leaving, legal experts claimed their incarceration could amount to false imprisonment.</p>

<p>Adam Wagner, a human rights barrister at Doughty Street chambers in London, wrote on Twitter: 'False imprisonment is detention without lawful authority.' </p>

<p>Hours later, university vice-chancellor Professor Malcolm Press conceded it could only 'expect' students to follow the self-isolation rules – designed to avoid spreading the infection to their home towns.</p>

<p>While many students pledged to stick it out, others were preparing to flee the city.</p>

<p>Tilly Thompson, 19, said she felt like a 'caged animal' and was waiting for her mother to take her home to Wolverhampton.</p>

<p>Students claimed some of those under restrictions had been ignoring the rules and throwing parties. One boasted the quarantine would be 'a two-week p***-up', saying he had '200 cans of lager' and 'it's going to get messy'.</p>

<p>A student called Tom told BBC Radio 5 Live that people had been running past their flats shouting: 'Open your doors, we've got coronavirus, we want to give it to you.' He added: 'It was insane... parties going on everywhere, loud music... It was like a prison riot.'</p>

<p>Martyn Moss, of the University and College Union, said he had warned MMU chiefs that their plans for the 'mass return of students would inevitably see institutions become Covid incubators'.</p>

<p>He added: 'Universities should have spent the summer following the science and preparing properly for this inevitable crisis.'</p>
