<p>Beau: However, fans hoping for a hot new showbiz romance are set to be disappointed, as Jenny is engaged to a man, publicly known only as Martin </p>

<p>She divorced her ex-husband Toby Baxendale in 2009 after a three-year marriage. They share daughters Constance, 19, and Pollyanna, 11.</p>

<p>Last year, Jenny spoke with Kate Thornton, during an appearance on the White Wine Question Time podcast, about meeting Martin by chance in 2016.</p>

<p>She recalled: 'I was in Pret a Manger at Euston waiting to get the train back up to Manchester and this Adonis walks in, I thought, "Bloody hell, he’s alright".</p>

<p>'And I just put my head down because I was ogling him, and this shadow loomed over me and it was him asking if he could sit down.' </p>

<p>She added: 'He was chatting away and he said, "Do you want my number?" And I said "What for?" I mean, what girl says that to a fit bloke?</p>

<p>'He went, "Well, you obviously haven’t been dating very much because now, in this day and age, I don’t put any pressure on you; I’ll give you the option. I will give you the number, then you can walk away and then you can think about it." </p>

<p>'So I grabbed the number off him. I texted him saying: "I'm a mature woman, I don’t play games. My name’s Jenny. This is me. This is my number. Whatever." He rang that night, and asked if he could take me out to dinner.'</p>

<p>After rising to fame on '80s TV show No Limits, Jenny appeared on Wheel Of Fortune alongside both Nicky Campbell and John Leslie from 1995 until 2001.   </p>
