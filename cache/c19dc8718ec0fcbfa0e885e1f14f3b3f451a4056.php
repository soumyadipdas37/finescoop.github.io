<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lesley-Lee Hill (pictured) allegedly blew cash donated on a GoFundMe page intended for her son's funeral on the pokies, cigarettes and clothes. Lucius Baira-Hill, 13, died in a horror car crash in Townsville on June 7</p>

<p>The mother of a 13-year-old boy who was killed in a horror crash alongside three other teenagers has been accused of blowing money raised for his funeral on trips to the pokies, clothing and cigarettes.</p>

<p>Lesley-Lee Hill's son Lucius died instantly when the allegedly stolen Kia Sorento he was a passenger in clipped a roundabout, flipped over and hit a light pole on June 7.</p>

<p>Well-wishers raised $7,000 on a GoFundMe page to help Lucius' family cover the costs of his funeral, but Hill, 28, allegedly blew about half the money on her own expenses in less than two weeks.</p>

<p>Police allege Hill was sent $3,600 from Lucius' father - who had run the fundraising page - in the days after the teenager's burial on June 22, while the funeral costs were paid for by the boy's grandmother, The Townsville Bulletin reported. </p>

<p>Hill allegedly spent most of that amount on clothing, pokies and cigarettes. </p>

<p>Hill last month was interviewed by police and a community call-out led to more than 40 complaints from people who had given money to the fundraiser.</p>

<p>The mother is due to front Townsville Magistrates Court on Tuesday and police will push for her to be denied bail.</p>

<p>Townsville Police's Child Protection Unit officer-in-charge Detective Senior Sergeant Dave Miles said the alleged profiteering was difficult to fathom.   </p>

<p>'To have an individual [allegedly] seek to profit from their own child’s death is hard to put into words,' he said. </p>

<p>Hill was previously granted a bail variation after she was released from custody on one count of unlawful use of a motor vehicle.</p>

<p>Her bail was changed to allow her to leave home to attend counselling sessions without her mother.   </p>

<p>The 14-year-old alleged driver was charged with a string of offences, including dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death, two counts of unlawful use of a motor vehicle, burglary and possessing dangerous drugs.  </p>
