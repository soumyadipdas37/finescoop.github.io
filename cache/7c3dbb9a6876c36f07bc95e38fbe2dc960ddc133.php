<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For budding young James Bonds and children of all ages who want to emulate their hero in a baby Aston Martin, engineers have created a scaled down fully working replica of 007's most iconic car from the 1960s.</p>

<p>The electric two-thirds scale DB5 has been created by the Bicester-based Little Car Company in collaboration with the British motor brand.</p>

<p>It celebrates the original DB5 launched in 1963 but which gained worldwide fame and iconic status when a gadget-laden version first appeared on the big screen in the 1964 James Bond movie 'Goldfinger' with Sean Connery - the first in a string of 007 appearances up to and including the forthcoming 'No Time to Die' with Daniel Craig.</p>

<p>Two versions are available: the DB5 Junior costing from £42,000 and the more powerful DB5 Vantage Junior from £54,000.</p>

<p>For budding Bonds: Aston Martin and Bicester-based Little Car Company have created a scaled-down electric replica of the legendary 1960s DB5. But it isn't cheap...</p>

<p>Incredibly, it means the toddler-friendly ride-on costs more than ten times the £4,175 price tag of the original DB5 in the '60s - though mint examples today sell for millions. </p>

<p>And it's a snip compared to the limited edition of DB5 Goldfinger continuation cars built by Aston Martin – complete with 007 gadgets including replica machine guns - selling ow for £3,3million each.</p>

<p>A limited run of only 1,059 Junior vehicles are being built, exactly the same number as the full-size DB5 of the 1960s – and owners of original cars are being offered the first the opportunity to buy one, with a matching chassis number to their car.</p>

<p>The two-thirds scale electric junior car has been over the last 15 months and is is based on Aston Martin's own 3D scan of an original DB5 to ensure complete accuracy and authenticity.</p>

<p>At 3 metres long and 1.1 metres wide, the DB5 Junior is designed to accommodate an adult and a child side by side in supportive bucket seats so as 'to allow different generations to share the love of driving'.</p>

<p>The car is constructed from a lightweight but rigid aluminium honeycomb chassis and composite body which helps keep the total weight down to around 270kg. </p>

<p>Two versions are available: the DB5 Junior costing from £42,000 and the more powerful DB5 Vantage Junior from £54,000</p>

<p>THe standard DB5 Junior is powered by a battery driven 6.7bhp 5kW electric motor driving the rear wheels up to a top speed on the standard DB5 Junior of 30mph, with a range of between 10 and 20 miles depending on how it is driven</p>

<p>The more potent - and more expensive - DB5 Vantage Junior model has an uprated 13.4bhp 10kW electric motor. It will hit nearly 50mph with a range of between 20 and 40 miles, says the makers</p>

<p>It is powered by a battery driven 6.7bhp 5kW electric motor driving the rear wheels up to a top speed on the standard DB5 Junior of 30mph, with a range of between 10 and 20 miles depending on how it is driven. </p>

<p>However, in a special 'race' mode, that cap cam be lifted so that it can accelerate from rest to 37mph in just six seconds up to a top speed of 42mph.</p>

<p>The more potent DB5 Vantage Junior model, with a 13.4bhp 10kW electric motor will hit nearly 50mph with a range of between 20 and 40 miles.</p>

<p>A second battery can be added, and each pack can be swapped for a replacement in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The DB5 Junior comes in famous Silver Birch colour as standard, with a full black leather interior and carpet set, and a boot in the rear for storage.</p>

<p>It has working headlights, brake lights, indicators and a horn. Power is regulated by aluminium accelerator and brake pedals.</p>

<p>At 3 metres long and 1.1 metres wide, the DB5 Junior is designed to accommodate an adult and a child side by side in supportive bucket seats so as 'to allow different generations to share the love of driving'</p>

<p>Like the original, the dashboard is filled with functional Smiths instruments, which have been cleverly updated for the 21st century; the fuel gauge has been converted into a battery meter and the oil temperature monitors the motor temperature</p>

<p>Cars will also come with a range of optional accessories including flight cases, additional batteries, covers, toolkits and custom number plates</p>

<p>A perfect two-thirds scale steering wheel has a racing-style quick release to make entry and exit easier for the driver.</p>

<p>Like the original, the dashboard is filled with functional Smiths instruments, which have been cleverly updated for the 21st century; the fuel gauge has been converted into a battery meter and  the oil temperature monitors the motor temperature.</p>

<p>And the same Smiths clock as seen in the original 1960s car sits proudly in front of the passenger seat.</p>

<p>The Little Car Company said: 'Absolute authenticity was key throughout the development of the vehicle. For example, the DB5 Junior sports the same iconic Aston Martin 'wings', 'shield' and DB5 badges as the original 1963 model.'</p>

<p>Also like the original, the car sits on double wishbone suspension at the front.</p>

<p>The scaled-down replica has 10-inch wire wheels, each with ventilated disc brakes with regenerative braking to help conserve and generate electric power en route</p>

<p>The painstaking attention to detail means the car is a shrunken-down version of the original (but with an electric power source) with everything from the instruments to the mirrors replicating the 1960s icon</p>

<p>The car is constructed from a lightweight but rigid aluminium honeycomb chassis and composite body which helps keep the total weight down to around 270kg</p>

<p>It rides on 10-inch wire wheels and has four-wheel ventilated disc brakes with regenerative braking to help conserve and generate electric power en route.</p>

<p>There's also a rally-style hydraulic handbrake which the creators say 'while strictly not necessary, does add to the fun for the bigger kids amongst us'.</p>

<p>There are three main driving modes.</p>

<p>In this mode there's also the addition of a remote 'kill switch', so the car can be disabled at the touch of a button on a fob at a range of up to 30 metres. This will automatically shut the powertrain down so the vehicles come to a gentle halt if an 'enthusiastic novice' goes beyond that range.</p>
