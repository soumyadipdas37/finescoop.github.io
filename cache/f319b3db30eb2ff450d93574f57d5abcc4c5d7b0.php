<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rio Ferdinand believes Mason Greenwood is a 'superstar in the making' and described the teenage Manchester United forward as a 'textbook goalscorer.'</p>

<p>The 18-year-old burst onto the scene last season at Old Trafford, scoring 19 goals during his first campaign with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's senior squad.</p>

<p>It led to Greenwood receiving his first England cap in last weekend's UEFA Nations League over Iceland.</p>

<p>Rio Ferdinand believes Man United forward Mason Greenwood will be a 'future superstar'</p>

<p>Old Trafford legend Ferdinand said Greenwood's finishing ability are like from a 'textbook'</p>

<p>But he was then sent home in disgrace after breaching Covid-19 protocols by sneaking two girls into the England team hotel.</p>

<p>However, United legend Ferdinand is confident Greenwood will go on to accomplish plenty in the game.</p>

<p>He told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'There's no doubt in my mind that this kid is going to be here to stay. He's here for the longevity.</p>

<p>'He's a superstar in the making. I don't want to add too much pressure [on] to him but the kid, in terms of natural born goalscorers, is the way if you were writing a textbook.</p>

<p>'He plays it the right way. He excited me massively.'</p>

<p>Greenwood scored 19 goals in an impressive breakthrough season for United during 2019-20</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate handed Greenwood his senior international debut last weekend against Iceland but the 18-year-old was later sent home from the England squad</p>

<p>Greenwood has been forced to train away from the rest of the United team as a precaution until he returns negative coronavirus tests and he won't be involved in this weekend's friendly against Aston Villa.</p>

<p>United begin their Premier League season a week later than most of the other teams following their run to the Europa League semi-finals last month.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former England defender Ferdinand believes Jadon Sancho would be a superb addition to the United side.</p>

<p>Ferdinand believes United shouldn't give up in their pursuit of England star Jadon SanchoÂ </p>

<p>There have been suggestions in recent days that United's pursuit of the Borussia Dortmund man is still going.</p>

<p>'I think you have to look at it and think to yourself Jadon Sancho is someone who adds a lot of goals, a lot of assists, creativity,' said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>'He draws players out of position. You need two or three players to come deal with him, which now allows other people like [Marcus] Rashford, Greenwood and [Anthony] Martial more space and what that means in terms of goals and opportunities - who knows?</p>

<p>'I think he brings you good problems for the manager.'</p>
