<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has stressed that his team's unity will be a major factor in the title race despite the spending power of their rivals.</p>

<p>After ending their 30 year wait to win the league title, Liverpool have had a rather quiet transfer window so far, with their sole acquisition seeing left-back Kostas Tsimakas arrive from Olympiacos for £11.75million.   </p>

<p>Despite the financial uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Manchester City and Chelsea have both spent heavily in this transfer window.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has stressed that Liverpool don't need to spend big to enjoy major success</p>

<p>Manchester City signed centre-back Nathan Ake this summer for a fee of £40million</p>

<p>Chelsea have spent significantly, with £89million Kai Havertz amongst their many purchases</p>

<p>City signed defender Nathan Ake from Bournemouth for £40million, with winger Ferran Torres joining from Valencia for £20.75million.</p>

<p>Chelsea, meanwhile, have been heavily active in the transfer market, securing deals for Hakim Ziyech (£37m), Chilwell (£50m), Timo Werner (£53m), Kai Havertz (£89m) while also brinign in Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr on free transfers.</p>

<p>Klopp, however, stressed that success isn't based entirely on a club's actions in the transfer market and says that Liverpool can still be successful even if they don't have the same financial power as City and Chelsea.</p>

<p>Speaking to BBC 5 Live Sport, Klopp said: 'We live in a world at the moment with a lot of uncertainty.</p>

<p>'For some clubs it seems to be less important how uncertain the future is. Owned by countries, owned by oligarchs, that's the truth.</p>

<p>'We're a different kind of club. We got to the Champions League final two years ago, we won it last year and became Premier League champions last season by being the club we are, by being lead the way we are leaded.'</p>

<p>Klopp stressed that working together on the training ground can prove to be hugely beneficial</p>

<p>Kostas Tsimkas, who joined from Olympiacos for £11.75million, is Liverpool's only signing so far</p>

<p>Klopp added that, although Chelsea have brought in a host of new stars, they may find it difficult to get them to gel immediately. </p>

<p>He said: 'We cannot change it just overnight and say 'so now we want to behave like Chelsea, now we want to behave like them.'</p>

<p>'Now they've signed a lot of players. That can be an advantage, of course, but that means that they have to fit together pretty quickly as well, it's not only about bringing quality in.</p>

<p>'You cannot bring in the 11 best players in the world and just hope a week later they will play the best football they'll ever play.'</p>

<p>Liverpool also didn't spend significantly last summer but still proceeded to win the Premier League.</p>

<p>Klopp says that by creating a strong bond on the training ground Liverpool are setting themselves up to succeed. </p>

<p>He said: 'It's about working together on the training ground. That will probably be an advantage for us. We worked quite a while with each other, but I know people don't want to hear that!</p>

<p>'But we did it last year pretty much that way. For our reasons, club reasons, we always want to improve, always want to improve the squad, but there are different ways.'</p>
