<p>'A lot of people probably don't know this, but Naya had the most incredible impressions,' he shared to E! News this week.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old said of Naya's impersonations that she 'was always, always ready to give you one if you were in a bad mood.'</p>

<p>Pictured in 2012: Chris Colfer recently revealed the way his late friend and Glee co-star Naya Rivera would lift his spirits when they were low</p>

<p>He dished: 'Yeah, she had this one of Kim Kardashian on jury duty that would always, always make me belly laugh whenever I needed it - I needed one.' </p>

<p>Kim is of course now an aspiring lawyer herself and is famously a prison reform advocate, working to get multiple convicts released from jail.</p>

<p>Chris and Naya starred on their teen show respectively as a gay singer and lesbian cheerleader who both join the high school glee club.</p>

<p>Naya's body was recovered from Lake Piru in California in July, days after she went missing during a boating trip with her son Josey, five, who was found safe. </p>

<p>As seen on the show: Chris and Naya starred on their teen show respectively as a gay singer and lesbian cheerleader who both join the high school glee club</p>

<p>She took Josey boating on Lake Piru on July 8 and vanished - he was found asleep on the boat but she was gone, though her life jacket was on board. </p>

<p>Police declared her presumed dead a day after her disappearance, and a search ensued until her body was retrieved on July 13.</p>

<p>At that time the Ventura County Medical Examiner's Office found no sign of drugs or alcohol being involved in her accidental drowning.</p>

<p>An autopsy report released in September said that she raised her arm from the water and called: 'Help!' after managing to place Josey back into the boat.</p>

<p>What a lineup: Demi Lovato and Adam Lambert are seen performing on an episode of Glee with Naya, Chris and their co-star Lea Michele</p>

<p>The report also showed that she had recently had a sinus infection, had previous vertigo issues and had small amounts of prescribed amphetamines in her system.</p>

<p>However Naya's prescription medication and physical conditions were not listed in the autopsy report as factors in her death.</p>

<p>She shared her son with her ex-husband Ryan Dorsey, who has moved her younger sister Nickayla into his home as he attempts to father his child alone.</p>

<p>There she is: Chris shared that Naya did an impersonation 'of Kim Kardashian on jury duty that would always, always make me belly laugh whenever I needed it - I needed one'</p>

<p>Ryan got candid about the living situation on Instagram after DailyMail.com exclusively spotted him and Nickayla holding hands.</p>

<p>During the emotional video this week he revealed that Josey requested that Nickayla move in 'because she's now the closest thing he has to a mom.'</p>

<p>Ryan revealed that he has 'probably lost a little over 20lbs' and 'don't really get sleep' since Naya's tragic death at the age of just 33. </p>
