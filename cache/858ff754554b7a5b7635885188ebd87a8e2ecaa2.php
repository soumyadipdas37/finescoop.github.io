<p>Mikey hit the headlines last year when he started training with England's blind squad after amazing coaches with his incredible football skills. </p>

<p>John and his wife Mireille , 37, took Mikey for a routine eye check in 2016 where he was diagnosed with rod cone dystrophy. </p>

<p>As he lost his sight, Mikey's football team told him that he could no longer play for them because it was a risk to other players. </p>

<p>But not wanting to give up, his parents then took him to Tottenham's Centre of Excellence where he joined the visually impaired team.</p>

<p>John previously said: 'One day the coach called me and said: "Your son's got amazing abilities, I want to call the FA for them to send a scout down to see him".</p>

<p>'We were just happy to have found a place for him to play and within a week he was signed up.'</p>

<p>Mikey now trains once a month with other blind children and England football team at Brighton FC’s training centre, and receives a weekly one-to-one coaching session funded by the FA. </p>

<p>And the team GB and England blind football head coach has been 'counting down the days' until Mikey is old enough to play for the national team. </p>
