<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A simple traffic rule quiz asking how much space should be kept between a vehicle when overtaking a cyclist took an unexpected turn.</p>

<p>The question was shared to Facebook by the Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads on Monday giving drivers a chance to prove they know their road rules.  </p>

<p>The image shows an orange vehicle driving behind a cyclist in a 70km/h zone.</p>

<p>'Bike riding's a great way to get some fresh air and exercise while you're practicing safe social distancing. What's the minimum passing distance the orange car needs to give this bike rider?' the department asked.</p>

<p>They gave four possible answers: 0.5metres, 1m, 1.5m or 2m. </p>

<p>The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads asked drivers how much space should be between a vehicle and cyclist when attempting to overtake</p>

<p>But social media users responded by blasting cyclists and calling for them to be banned from roads. </p>

<p>'Cyclists are arrogant, full stop the end. They shouldn't be on the road,' one wrote.</p>

<p>Should cyclists be allowed to ride on roads with 70km/h speed limits?</p>

<p>Should cyclists be allowed to ride on roads with 70km/h speed limits?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>'I'll pass after I've hit the horn so that they veer off the road. 1.5m met. Easy. And one less rule breaking entitled cow on the road,' another angry driver commented.</p>

<p>'E. get off the bl**dy road its 70km/h not 15km/h,' someone else wrote.</p>

<p>'Why is the bicycle even on this road? They should be restricted to bike lanes or 60km/h roads. When cyclists generally start demonstrating road courtesy is when I'll change my attitude to them,' another commented.</p>

<p>Other social media users however responded to the departments simple question without engaging in the debate.   </p>

<p>'1.5m, but there should also be a law for the the cyclist to keep as far left as possible, that way it's safer for both,' someone wrote.</p>

<p>'1.5m is the absolute legal minimum,' another commented.</p>

<p>'C (1.5 metres) since the posted speed limit is over 60km/h,' someone else commented.</p>

<p>The department confirmed that the safest distance when overtaking a cyclist is 1.5m. </p>
