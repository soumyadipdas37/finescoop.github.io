<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The anti-Trump group Refuse Fascism staged a series of protests across the United States on Saturday, as America's chaotic and turbulent summer continued.</p>

<p>Over two dozen protests were scheduled, with large gatherings happening in Los Angeles and New York.</p>

<p>Holding aloft orange placards and banners reading 'Trump/Pence out now', they marched through cities across the U.S.</p>

<p>In New York City's Union Square, one protester hoisted a giant image of Trump as a devil on his shoulders.</p>

<p>The New York City march then wove through Manhattan, heading up towards Times Square. </p>

<p>In Washington DC, protesters took to the streets on skateboards, on bicycles and on foot, heading for Lafayette Square and the White House.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump spent Saturday playing golf at his course in Sterling, Virginia, and so was not home for their noisy demonstration.</p>

<p>The crowd held aloft the orange placards, and posed for photos in front of the White House.</p>

<p>Some had hand-made signs demanding the defunding of police, and an end to police brutality.</p>

<p>Outside Trump's golf course, meanwhile, rival pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators waved their flags.</p>

<p>Some brandished Biden-Harris banners, while others held flags in support of the president. </p>

<p>In Kentucky, armed supporters of the police and anti-racism protesters squared off near the famed Kentucky Derby horse race on Saturday, as dueling demonstrations over racial justice and policing continued to grind on across U.S. cities.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, a large group of protesters marched toward the Churchill Downs track chanting 'No Justice, No Derby' - a nod to an earlier call by activists for the historic race in Louisville, Kentucky, to be canceled. </p>

<p>The race was being held without spectators to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, some of the counter-protesters outside Churchill Downs, brandishing pistols and long guns, squared off with a group of Black Lives Matter protesters and got into shoving matches. </p>

<p>People on both sides screamed, faces inches apart. After about 45 minutes, police cleared the people from the park, but the protests outside Churchill Downs continued.</p>

<p>The counter-protesters included about 250 pro-police demonstrators called 'The Angry Vikings,' who were armed and dressed in tactical gear.</p>

<p>Demonstrations against racism and police brutality have swept the United States since May 25 when George Floyd, a Black man, died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a group of about 200 members of NFAC — a black militia group which has protested against police killings of black people — had gathered at a park just outside Churchill Downs and were inspecting their weapons, with the Derby preliminaries well underway inside. </p>

<p>Most of the NFAC militia members came from Georgia, according to a local reporter, Travis Ragsdale </p>

<p>NFAC, which stands for 'Not F***ing Around Coalition,' was in the city in July protesting injustice in the Breonna Taylor case.</p>

<p>Organizers said they would return if Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron didn't complete the investigation into Breonna Taylor's death. </p>

<p>Louisville has emerged as one flashpoint in a summer of unrest due to the death of Taylor, a black 26-year-old woman who was killed when the city's police burst into her apartment with a 'no-knock' arrest warrant in March.  </p>

<p>'When they start the race, ain't nobody going to be enjoying themselves,' NFAC leader John 'Grandmaster Jay' Johnson said. </p>

<p>'You see, they're looking at us right now. They really don't give a damn about no race. </p>

<p>'Louisville, y'all brought this on yourself.'</p>

<p>Johnson then led the group back to G.G. Moore Park, where the NFAC's march began, shortly before the running of the Derby. </p>

<p>As the NFAC did a 'weapons check' before the start of the march at G.G. Moore Park, WDRB reported that one of the leaders only wanted people with long weapons.</p>

<p>'If you're only carrying a pistol, you will not be allowed in this formation,' he reportedly said. </p>

<p>Kentucky has no restrictions on the open carrying of firearms by anyone over the age of 18</p>

<p>Hundreds of heavily-armed protesters descended on Louisville to demand justice for Breonna Taylor on Derby Day</p>
