<p>Caitlyn wore her long hair tied back into a ponytail, which was a propos given that earlier in the day she'd shared throwback video from KUWTK in which she and Kris faced off over a haircut.</p>

<p>In the video, posted to Caitlyn's new YouTube channel, Bruce, as she was then, is seen with Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian at a hair styling session.</p>

<p>Just a trim: When Kris arrives to see what's going on, she is less than impressed that her husband isn't getting a short back and sides</p>

<p>There then ensued great hilarity at the unfortunate Rob who suffered a lasting erection and had to seek medical help.</p>

<p>The father of Kendall and Kylie Jenner announced her gender transition back in 2015, the same year that her marriage to Kris formally ended.</p>

<p>She went on to star in the E! reality show I Am Cait which ran for two seasons. </p>
