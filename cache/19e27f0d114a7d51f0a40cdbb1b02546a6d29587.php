<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father who has been given months to live following a devastating pancreatic cancer diagnosis is desperately fundraising to provide a home for his wife and child after he dies.</p>

<p>James Roocroft, 43, from Brighton, works as a school caretaker where his home comes with his job - meaning wife Emma and two-year-old son Archie will no longer be able to live there when he's gone.</p>

<p>His friends have launched a GoFundMe page to help raise money towards the family's future - and it's raised £28,540 in a week.</p>

<p>Speaking about their heartbreaking situation, Emma said: 'I'm losing the person that I absolutely love, Archie and I are losing our home, and Archie's losing all his stability. </p>

<p>James Roocroft, 43, from Brighton, has been given months to live following a devastating pancreatic cancer diagnosis and is desperately fundraising to provide a home for his wife Emma and son Archie (pictured together) after he dies</p>

<p>'We always wanted to give him a little brother or sister, so I feel like I'm also losing that potential of another baby.' </p>

<p>Emma and James, who met at a Match.com singles night, have been together for five years.</p>

<p>Having led a fit and healthy lifestyle, in June this year James began feeling unwell and started to lose weight rapidly.</p>

<p>Weeks later test results revealed he had cancer in his pancreas, liver and lungs - later diagnosed as a stage four and terminal.  </p>

<p>James and Emma's friends have launched a GoFundMe page to help raise money towards the family's future - and it's raised £28,540 in a week. Pictured: James with Archie</p>

<p>Without chemotherapy, James has been told he has six weeks to live, but undergoing chemo could give him up to eight months if he's lucky.  </p>

<p>The family are currently self-isolating to protect James's immune system, while Emma cares for both James and Archie full time.</p>

<p>James and Emma had been planning a big wedding once Archie was old enough to understand the ceremony, but after receiving the heartbreaking diagnosis the couple decided to get married. </p>

<p>Concerned a registrar would be unable to marry them in between James' appointments and fearing he wouldn't be well enough to travel to the town hall, the couple managed to tie the knot at the Macmillan Horizon Centre earlier this month. </p>

<p>Concerned a registrar would be unable to marry them in between James' appointments and fearing he wouldn't be well enough to travel to the town hall, the couple managed to tie the knot at the Macmillan Horizon Centre earlier this month (pictured)</p>

<p>James says he can't get his head around the fact that he'll never be able to go back to work. He explained: 'Dyslexia has always been a battle, and I've had a lot of battles but have always been a grafter. </p>

<p>'I ran my own landscaping company for many years, then became a school caretaker and finally a site manager. This is just another battle. </p>

<p>'However, I always thought I'd be there for Emma and Archie, teaching him how to fix things himself and be a practical, helpful, diligent person. Instead all this will fall on Emma's shoulders.'</p>

<p>As the caretaker and site manager of a primary school, James' job provides a house for them onsite where he has lived for nine years and renovated and transformed it into a family home. </p>

<p>As the caretaker and site manager of a primary school, James' job provides a house for them onsite where he has lived for nine years and renovated and transformed it into a family home. He now worries Emma and Archie will be homeless when he passes away</p>

<p>He is now plagued with anxiety not only due to his own health but because once he dies, Emma and Archie will become homeless. </p>

<p>James' last wish before he passes is to ensure Emma and Archie will be all right financially, and able to stay in Brighton where their support network is, as they come to terms with their devastating loss. </p>

<p>Emma currently has a one-bedroom flat in Hove which she rents out on an interest-only buy-to-let mortgage, so her deposit is tied up.</p>

<p>She would like to move into the flat, which has a garden for Archie and is close to the beach, but would need to pay off a chunk of the mortgage to make it possible.</p>

<p>At the moment Emma won't be able to afford the monthly cost of a mortgage to live in her flat, even if she works full time, when childcare costs are factored in</p>

<p>Her current wages don't enable her to remortgage the flat or cover the cost of renting somewhere else – and due to owning this flat she isn't entitled to any state help. </p>

<p>The couple's friend Ben Vaudiaux Lowe, who set up the fundraiser, said: 'We are hoping to raise money for Emma and Archie, to make their future somewhat easier with fewer financial worries, to help them either find another home or to help them afford the cost of living in Emma's flat. </p>

<p>'They would appreciate any help you can offer, and any donations will not only make a huge difference to Emma and Archie's future, but will help give James peace of mind in his final weeks.'</p>

<p>Speaking about the kind donations made so far, James said: 'I can't explain how much of of a boost this is all giving me, thank you so much. It's making me feel strong for my next chemo.' </p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of the disease, and around 95 per cent of people who contract it die from it.  </p>

<p>Joan Crawford, Patrick Swayze and Luciano Pavarotti all died of pancreatic cancer.</p>

<p>It is the sixth most common cause of cancer death in the UK – around 10,000 people are diagnosed with pancreatic cancer each year in the UK, alongside about 55,000 in the US.</p>

<p>WHAT IS THE CAUSE?</p>

<p>It is caused by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells in the pancreas - a large gland in the digestive system.</p>

<p>WHO HAS THE HIGHEST RISK?</p>

<p>Most cases (90 per cent) are in people over the age of 55.</p>

<p>Around half of all new cases occur in people aged 75 or older.</p>

<p>One in 10 cases are attributed to genetics.</p>

<p>Other possible causes include age, smoking and other health conditions, including diabetes.</p>

<p>WHY IS IT SO LETHAL?</p>

<p>There is no screening method for pancreatic cancer. </p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer typically does not show symptoms in the early stages, when it would be more manageable. </p>

<p>Sufferers tend to start developing the tell-tale signs - jaundice and abdominal pain - around stage 3 or 4, when it has likely already spread to other organs.    </p>

<p>WHAT ARE THE TREATMENT OPTIONS? </p>

<p>The only effective treatment is removal of the pancreas. </p>

<p>This proves largely ineffective for those whose cancer has spread to other organs. </p>

<p>In those cases, palliative care is advised to ease their pain at the end of their life.  </p>
