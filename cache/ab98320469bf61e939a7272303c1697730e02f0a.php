<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry is being urged to get a Netflix musical about his mother pulled, days after he signed a multimillionaire-pound deal with the streaming service.</p>

<p>Netflix will screen the controversial musical, named 'Diana: A New Musical', which features a fictitious scene where the Queen labels her a 'tart'.</p>

<p>Other controversial lines include the Queen saying to Diana: 'In the old days we would have chopped off your head,' while another scene sees Diana in bed with James Hewitt.</p>

<p>Now a former bodyguard of the late princess is calling on her son to get the musical pulled from the streaming service.</p>

<p>The calls come after the prince and Meghan Markle signed a deal, believed to be worth up to £112million, with Netflix this week for their new yet-to-be-named production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming. </p>

<p>Ken Wharfe, 72, Diana's former bodyguard, The Sun: 'The Diana musical, soon to be premiered on Netflix, presents a huge dilemma to them both.</p>

<p>Netflix will screen the controversial musical, named 'Diana: A New Musical', which features a scene where the actor playing the Queen labels her a 'tart'. Pictured: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle who this week signed a deal with Netflix</p>

<p>'If the critics are to be believed, this musical story is not a joyous journey of love with a happy ending but an episodic account of untruths, scandal and sex.</p>

<p>'He now has the chance, irrespective of his lucrative deal with Netflix, to stand alone from his wife and make clear his abhorrence of such a musical and call Netflix to account.'</p>

<p>The musical began previews in March but never officially made its debut on Broadway due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>In an unconventional step, the musical is set to skip Broadway and go straight on to Netflix.</p>

<p>The musical features a number of controversial lines including one in which the Queen says to Diana: 'She's going out dressed up like a tart'.</p>

<p>In another line, Charles says to Diana: 'Another boy. It seems you ignored my request for a girl,' while the Queen also says: 'In the old days we would have chopped of your head.'</p>

<p>James Hewitt also remarks 'You'll like my horse,' when Diana asks for a riding lesson, while butler Paul Burrell calls a dress Diana wears as a 'f<strong>kety, f</strong>kety, f<strong>kety,  f</strong>ket, f**k you dress.'</p>

<p>The cast and crew are set to reunite in an empty theatre this month to perform the musical for cameras and put the finished product on the digital platform for broadcast next year, before the show welcomes a live audience again.</p>

<p>'We speak for the entire company when we say that we couldn't be more excited to finally be able to share our show with theatre lovers everywhere,' the show's producers said in a statement last month.</p>

<p>Diana is advertised as the tragic and yet inspiring story of a young woman learning to break free of the confines of the British royal family.</p>

<p>It has songs by Bon Jovi keyboardist David Bryan and a story by playwright Joe DiPietro. The pair also collaborated on the Tony-winning Memphis.</p>

<p>Diana stars Jeanna De Waal in the title role, and explores Diana's glamour and charity work and the slow public crumbling of her relationship with Prince Charles.</p>

<p>She died in a car crash in Paris in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi.</p>

<p>Her story is also featured in season four of The Crown and her sons - princes Harry and William - are a source of constant news.</p>

<p>But it also features topics including the breakdown of Diana's marriage to Prince Charles, with swathes of vulgar dialogue and scenes of fiction, reports The Sun.</p>

<p>Diana is also shown to self-harm after Charles moans about 'another boy' when Harry is born, the paper says.</p>
