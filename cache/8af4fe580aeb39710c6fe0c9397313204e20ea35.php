<p>The star returned to London last month after she had been isolating in her Cotswolds mansion with her daughter Lila, 17, alongside Kate's long-term partner Count Nikolai von Bismarck, 33, and her half-sister Lottie, 22. </p>

<p>The troupe were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown. </p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together. </p>

<p>'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.</p>

<p>'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.' </p>

<p>After putting her boozy benders behind her years ago, Kate recently said she now prefers to balance her life with yoga and enjoys watching Netflix before bed.</p>

<p>Two years ago, she told NBC's Megyn Kelly: 'I take care of myself now, I'm a good girl. I go to bed, I drink lots of water, not too much coffee, and I'm trying to cut down on cigarettes.'</p>

<p>In the mid-90s, the mother-of-one spent her days moving from the catwalk to the bar, with The Groucho Club, The Ivy and her friends' luxurious pads in NW1 all second homes.</p>

<p>After attending a week-long detox in Turkey back in June 2015, the runway sensation wound up being escorted off an easyJet flight home after her airport drinking session took a heavy turn.</p>

<p>Last month she told Elle: 'I hit the sack at 11pm-ish and watch Netflix before I go to sleep. I deal with stress by doing yoga. It helps me concentrate on the here and now.' </p>
