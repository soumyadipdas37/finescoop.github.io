<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A hero of the 9/11 New York terror attacks has died from coronavirus just 12 days before his brother also died from the disease.</p>

<p>The double tragedy saw Ralph and Nicholas Gismondi, originally from Queens, New York, die of the illness.</p>

<p>The pair were 'big family men,' according to CNN which added that they were so beloved that neighbours posted banners praising them when they died.</p>

<p>Ralph Gismondi, 68, had helped to rescue victims of the Al-Qaeda attacks on the World Trade Center.</p>

<p>Ralph Gismondi, 65, who died of coronavirus just 12 days before his brother Nicholas did</p>

<p>He held the rank of captain in the FDNY and he was one of the first from the department to respond to the 2001 terror attacks.</p>

<p>Upon retiring he worked as a flight attendant on JetBlue airlines, based at JFK Airport. He began to suffer from a cough, fever and shortness of breath on March 17.</p>

<p>Then two days later both he and his wife Ann, who he had known since they were teenagers, tested positive for the virus.</p>

<p>Ralph died of complications because of covid-19 on April 5.</p>

<p>Ann Gismondi told CNN: 'I could not have a funeral for him. I did not have, you know, that closure. It was just a freaking nightmare.' </p>

<p>Nicholas Gismondi, 65, did not learn of his brother's death until he himself was in hospital with the virus.</p>

<p>Nicholas, known to friends as Poppi, was a very good baseball player when he attended Monsignor McClancy High School.</p>

<p>He then went onto study accountancy and relocated to Westfield, New Jersey, 30 years ago. He became a pillar of the community and earned the nickname 'Mr Nick.'</p>

<p>Christopher, his son, told CNN that his dad was 'someone who always wanted to turn life's lemons into lemonade.'</p>

<p>Nicholas' wife, Mary Jane, added: 'Volunteerism and giving back to the community were very important to him.'</p>

<p>The couple began to suffer from coronavirus symptoms on March and they were then diagnosed in hospital.</p>

<p>Then just 18 days later, less than two weeks after his brother Ralph died of coronavirus, Nicholas too succumbed to it.</p>

<p>They are survived by their parents Nicholas, 96, and Josephine, 93, and a sister.</p>
