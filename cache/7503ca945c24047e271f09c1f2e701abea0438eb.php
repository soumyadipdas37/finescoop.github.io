<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster could reportedly return to Swansea City on loan following a successful spell with the Championship side last season.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old has been one of the most sought-after young stars in England after an impressive loan-spell at Steve Cooper's side has now led to Premier League interest. </p>

<p>Newcastle, Aston Villa and Crystal Palace have each made official approaches for Brewster, only to be informed the club and player are in no rush to make any decision just yet. </p>

<p>Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster could return to Swansea despite Premier League interest</p>

<p>Liverpool and Brewster are in no rush to make any decision on the striker's future just yet</p>

<p>However each of those clubs have set their sights elsewhere with Newcastle and Aston Villa both signing a striker in the last week. </p>

<p>Newcastle signed Callum Wilson from Bournemouth for £20m and Aston Villa completed a club-record £28m deal for Ollie Watkins from Brentford on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Crystal Palace meanwhile are on the verge of reaching a loan agreement with Chelsea over Michy Batshuayi.</p>

<p>And as reported by the Telegraph, this has brought Swansea City back into the picture, which could see Brewster again reunited with former Liverpool academy coach Cooper.</p>

<p>Swansea would be very keen on a deal after he impressed on-loan during the second-half of last season, where he scored 11 goals in 22 appearances. </p>

<p>Brighton are also interested in the 20-year-old but Brewster will have to decide how likely he is to force his way into the starting line-up if he makes a Premiership move.</p>

<p>Brewster impressed on loan at Steve Cooper's side last season where he scored 11 goals</p>

<p>Liverpool could be tempted by a £25m bid if it includes a buy-back clause to protect their asset, however a loan deal still looks most likely before the transfer window closes in October.</p>

<p>Returning to Swansea, where he would be a guaranteed starter, is a consideration to give him a full year's senior football, with Premier League interest likely to remain strong next year.</p>
