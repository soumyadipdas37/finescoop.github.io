<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Previously banned school formals will go ahead in New South Wales after outrage from students and parents.</p>

<p>But some activities such as dancing and group singing will be banned from going ahead at next term's end of school year celebrations, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Monday.</p>

<p>It comes after she announced on Friday that school formals and graduations will go ahead, as the state remained largely on top of the virus.</p>

<p>NSW recorded four new coronavirus cases on Monday.</p>

<p>Three cases were all healthcare workers while the other was a returned traveller. </p>

<p>Year 12 NSW students will be allowed to celebrate at formals in a COVID safe way (stock)</p>

<p>'I have every confidence that in Term 4 we would see formals, we would see graduations, but obviously in a COVID safe way,' Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Friday.</p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian explained that the larger schools would still be able to celebrate but on the basis of 'multiple events of the same occasion'. </p>

<p>This means that bigger schools would have to have to break up their formals into multiple events so as to limit numbers at each and reduce the risk of COVID infections.</p>

<p>'But I just want students who are doing the HSC to please not stress about that,' Ms Berejiklian continued.</p>

<p>'Please know our focus is to provide the best environment for you to have an uninterrupted exam period.' </p>

<p>The exciting announcement comes after NSW recorded a further eight cases of COVID-19 on Friday. </p>

<p>Seven cases were linked to known coronavirus clusters in Sydney and one was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine. Bunnings Padstow (pictured) has been put on alert after an infectious customer visited the store between 12pm and 2pm on August 27 </p>

<p>One new case was a returned traveller in hotel quarantine and the other seven locally acquired cases have been linked to a known source.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Health Officer Dr Jeremy McAnulty confirmed three of the new cases were linked to the growing cluster in Sydney's CBD.</p>

<p>Bunnings and Aldi have been also put on high alert after an infectious customer visited the stores in western Sydney.</p>

<p>Two new cases were household contacts linked to the Liverpool Hospital cluster and two were linked to St Paul's Catholic College in Greystanes.</p>

<p>Two previously announced cases were linked to the CBD outbreak, originating with the City Tattersalls gym, and brought the total number of cases in the cluster to 57.   </p>

<p>Fitness First in Randwick is now undergoing a deep clean, with all visitors on August 23 and September 1 asked to watch for symptoms and undergo urgent testing.</p>

<p>Regents Park Christian School, in western Sydney, is also closed, with anyone who attended after-school care on August 31 or September 1 considered a close contact.</p>

<p>A virus alert was sent out for Aldi in North Strathfield after a positive coronavirus case visited the store between 10am and 10.30am on September 1.</p>
