<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A student who was jailed and put in solitary confinement for hitchhiking across closed state borders has opened up her 'nightmare' ordeal.</p>

<p>Asher Faye Vander Sanden travelled from coronavirus-ravaged Victoria to Western Australia by road between July 30 and August 11. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old had been granted permission to enter the state, but police issued a warrant for her arrest when she failed to arrive by plane at Perth Airport as expected.</p>

<p>The construction was arrested by police at her boyfriend's home in Scarborough on August 11 after sneaking into the state and skipping hotel quarantine.   </p>

<p>Asher Faye Vander Sanden, 28, (pictured) was handed a six month jail sentence after pleading guilty to breaching the Emergency Management Act</p>

<p>She spent three weeks of her six-month jail sentence in Bandyup prison, near Perth, in what was the nation's most severe punishment for breaching coronavirus rules.</p>

<p>Vander Sanden told 9 News the sentence, which involved two weeks in solitude, was 'like I got kicked in the stomach'.</p>

<p>'I was gobsmacked, I was shocked … Just completely powerless,' she said. </p>

<p>'It was a nightmare. It was cold, it was boring. I read five books in five days, I walked around the cell for entertainment.' </p>

<p>Vander Sanden said the sentence, which involved two weeks in solitude, was 'like I got kicked in the stomach'</p>

<p>It was reported Vander Sanden wanted to dodge the mandatory $2,500 hotel quarantine fee, but she insisted she hitched a ride with a truckie because her flight back to WA was cancelled. </p>

<p>'I felt alone and I had to make my own way home, because everything I tried at that point failed,' she said.  </p>

<p>Vander Sanden was charged with one count of failing to comply with a direction of the Emergency Management Act.  </p>

<p>Her lawyer, John Hammond, told the Perth Magistrates Court the penalty was too severe.</p>

<p>He argued while she had a criminal record, it was related to a past 'meth habit' which was no longer an issue. </p>

<p>Vander Sanden's (pictured) lawyer, John Hammond, told the Perth Magistrates Court the penalty was too severe</p>

<p>During the sentencing on last month, magistrate Andrew Matthews told Vander Sanden her actions had the potential to undo 'what this government has done to prevent community spread'.</p>

<p>The woman agreed that she should be punished for her actions, and apologised to the community for putting them at risk. </p>

<p>'I understand why people are upset at me and I understand that I did take a huge risk at other people's expense, and I apologise. Deep down, I am very sorry,' she said. </p>

<p>On Tuesday, her sentence was overturned and she was ordered to complete 50 hours of community service.</p>
