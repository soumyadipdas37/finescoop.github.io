<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British man accused of murdering a sex worker in Thailand with a snooker cue has fled the country and is believed to be hiding in Northern Ireland.  </p>

<p>Neil Henry Elliott, 46, was arrested on April 30 after the unidentified sex worker was found dead at his home in Pattaya, Thailand.    </p>

<p>The pair are thought to have started arguing before the woman, known only as Onn, was allegedly battered with a snooker cue before being stabbed with a machete. </p>

<p>The following day Elliott was taken in handcuffs to a police crime reconstruction to revisit the area where he picked up the woman from a deserted strip of bars.  </p>

<p>It is unclear how he was able to leave the country and travel to Ireland.</p>

<p>The Gardai have now launched a search for the suspect as he is 'wanted in Thailand for the murder of a sex worker,' the Irish Independent reported. </p>

<p>Neil Henry Elliott, 46, was arrested on April 30 after the unidentified sex worker was found dead at his home in Pattaya, Thailand</p>

<p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland believe that Elliot is in County Cavan and is suspected of planning to flee the country from Dublin Airport.</p>

<p>Elliott, who is a motorbike fanatic, reportedly has links to Louth, Monaghan and Cavan.</p>

<p>Police in Pattaya were not available earlier today to answer requests for information about the case.</p>

<p>Police Colonel Chiddecha Songhong, the original investigating officer in the case from the Banglamung district station, has been transferred to a different region, according to police.</p>

<p>Elliott was arrested on suspicion of murder before being handcuffed and hauled into a police pick-up truck to be driven away to the station for questioning</p>

<p>Pictures from the property showed the broken snooker cue on the blood-covered ground and the machete on the covered snooker table </p>

<p>Elliott, from Fermanagh, Northern Ireland, allegedly admitted to police that he picked up the woman from the red-light street Soi Buakhao before they returned to his single-story home.</p>

<p>They then allegedly took Yaba - a powerful form of methamphetamine - and had sex.</p>

<p>Elliott later battered Onn, who was aged between 35 and 40, with a wooden snooker cue until the butt broke before slashing her with a 60cm-long machete on the wrists and neck, police claim.</p>

<p>He then allegedly left the building and crashed his motorcycle before paramedics who treated him alerted police. </p>

<p>They went to the home and found Onn's dead body in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Pictures from the property showed the broken snooker cue on the blood-covered ground and the machete on the covered snooker table. </p>

<p>A large Northern Ireland flag was hanging at the entrance to Elliott's single-storey property and police later confirmed Elliott was from the country.</p>

<p>Elliott was immediately arrested on suspicion of murder. He was handcuffed and hauled into a police pick-up truck before being driven away to the station for questioning.</p>

<p>Police said at the time that Elliott had admitted killing the sex worker. </p>

<p>He allegedly claimed he had acted in self-defence and instructed his lawyer to claim diminished responsibility due to the level of drugs in his system at the time of the killing.</p>
