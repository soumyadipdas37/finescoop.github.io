<p>'She had great empathy with people,' May added. 'She didn't mind shaking hands, cuddling, sitting on the beds of people who were ill.' </p>

<p>In April 1987, Princess Diana shook hands with a gay man who was dying of AIDS.</p>

<p>The People's Princess touched the unnamed man without wearing gloves, challenging the previously believed notion the disease could be passed via skin-to-skin contact.</p>

<p>She was quoted as saying: 'HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it'. </p>
