<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There is one thing these hotels all have in common - they have gone to great lengths to provide guests with a spectacular swimming pool.</p>

<p>Whether you're looking for somewhere to clock up the laps or the perfect spot to unwind, dive head first into our round-up of the UK's most enticing hotel pools.</p>

<p>The Scarlet, Cornwall</p>

<p>To infinity and beyond: The stunning pool at The Scarlet in Cornwall</p>

<p>Close to Newquay, The Scarlet’s 43ft pool, with floor-to-ceiling windows affording views across the Atlantic, is a stunner; a kind of indoor infinity pool. But this Cornish luxury spot outdoes itself with its own reed filtered cold water swimming pond high on the clifftops. It’s best to enjoy an invigorating dip late in the day, as the sun slips into the sea. If it gets a tad too chilly, there’s a hot tub for warming up afterwards. </p>

<p>Rooms from £210 a night (scarlethotel.co.uk).</p>

<p>Burley Manor, New Forest</p>

<p>Enticing: Burley Manor's seasonal outdoor pool makes it an exceptional hotel</p>

<p>In the heart of Hampshire’s beautiful New Forest, the Manor’s Grade II listed facade and 40 luxurious bedrooms are enough to entice anyone looking for a country escape. Its seasonal outdoor pool, however, makes it exceptional.</p>

<p>Open until September, it provides a frog’s eye view of the adjacent deer park and surrounding woodland, with birds singing while guests plough out a slow breaststroke. Grab a sun lounger, order a cocktail and enjoy a quintessentially English summer break.</p>

<p>Slip in for a quick dip and then stay submerged while working out stressful kinks. Ideal for anyone who’s been working at a makeshift desk for the past three months. Be sure to indulge in a spa treatment for maximum relaxation.</p>

<p>Surrounded by 470 acres of landscaped gardens and wild woodland in Leatherhead, Beaverbrook reopened this summer with just 35 rooms spread across its vast estate.

In the shadow of the main house, it’s perfect for those who love to get in an early morning stretch and complete a few laps before breakfast. </p>

<p>The vibe is more leisurely as the day passes, with the chance to take a seat poolside and read between dips.</p>

<p>Rectory Hotel, Cotswolds</p>

<p>This stunning Malmsbury bolthole, once home to a rector and his 14 children, is the ideal location for some post-lockdown R&amp;R. There’s no swimming in the ancient Baptism pool at the front, but there’s a lush outdoor pool, all the better at the height of summer when this part of England is at its bucolic best. It pays to swim before settling down to the hotel’s indulgent afternoon tea. There’s no comfortable way of taking a dip after all those scones.</p>

<p>South Lodge, West Sussex</p>

<p>South Lodge boasts an amazing 60ft outdoor pond, which is big enough for front-crawl practice and cooling plunges</p>

<p>While it’s tempting to dive into the indoor pool at this Horsham hotel, swimming here is all about the 60ft outdoor pond. Long enough for anyone who wants to practice their front crawl, it’s also ideal for a leisurely, cooling plunge after time spent in the on-site spa.</p>

<p>The poolside deck is the place to be for those who can handle the cold and prefer to take multiple swims. A dreamy way to pass a summer afternoon.</p>

<p>Rising above the shores of Newcastle Bay, the hotel’s pool brings the best of outdoor swimming inside. Its vast floor-to-ceiling windows give swimmers views out across the bay, with the moody Mountains of Mourne glowering high above. At 65ft it’s long enough for muscle-burning workouts, while the adjacent vitality pool, with submerged seating, is the place to relax afterwards, with Northern Ireland’s finest scenery on show.</p>

<p>B&amp;B from £230 a night (walwickhall.com).</p>

<p>St Moritz, Cornwall</p>

<p>For guests who don’t fancy braving the busy beach, the gorgeous pool at St Moritz, Cornwall, is the ideal alternative</p>

<p>A stone’s throw from Polzeath, St Moritz’s self-catering cottages make for a brilliant British escape this summer.
