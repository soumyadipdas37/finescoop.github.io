<p>Former air hostess Alexandra Dobre, 27, is thought to have worked for Ryanair and Wizz Air</p>

<p>Dobre had been based at London Luton Airport but was made redundant during lockdown</p>

<p>Staffordshire Police then stopped her grey Fiat Punto in Stoke-on-Trent on the night of August 7 this year and found six wraps of cocaine inside her purse. </p>

<p>Neil Ahuja, prosecuting, told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court: 'She was evasive with the officers about where she was living.'</p>

<p>Police searched a flat in Hanley and came across 81 small snap-seal bags of white powder concealed in a bedside table, which tested positive for cocaine.</p>

<p>Another six sealed bags of the class A substance were found. In total, the 19.4 grams had an estimated street value of between £1,740 and £2,610. </p>

<p>Detectives also seized £480 in cash, along with a mobile phone. Dobre pleaded guilty to possession of Class A drugs with intent to supply.</p>

<p>Paul Cliff, defending, said she moved to Britain from Romania three years ago, adding: 'She was a flight attendant for a number of years, with different airlines. </p>

<p>He added: She was well-paid, but lost her job in spring this year and lost her accommodation as a result of that. She was at a loose end over what to do next. </p>

<p>'She had friends in the North Staffordshire area, one of whom was a nail and beauty technician, and came up to Stoke-on-Trent.' </p>

<p>He added: 'Since her arrest, he has disappeared into the ether and she has not been able to contact him. She was plainly acting under direction.</p>

<p>'One of the terrible consequences of her offending is she will never work as a flight attendant again. It's something she loved. She is not by nature criminally minded. </p>

<p>'She's from a good family in Romania. She knows her family will be absolutely mortified that she has found herself involved in something of this nature.' </p>

<p>Sentencing her to 28 months in prison, Judge David Fletcher said she must have understood what she was doing was a crime.</p>

<p>He told her: 'It was a class A substance, the consumption of which causes misery. You were an important cog in that wheel of the supply of this particular drug.'</p>

<p>Dobre was described as an 'important cog in that wheel of the supply of this particular drug'</p>

<p>After the case, Sergeant Marc Proctor, of Stoke South Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: 'We welcome the sentence Dobre has been handed by the courts.</p>

<p>'Drugs can cause a huge amount of disruption to the community and we are committed to tackling this behaviour.</p>

<p>'We would urge everyone to report drug matters to us. Let's work together and deter this behaviour from continuing.' </p>

<p>Dobre has posted a number of glamorous photographs on her Instagram page including some of her posing next to planes in her uniform and sitting on the beach.</p>
