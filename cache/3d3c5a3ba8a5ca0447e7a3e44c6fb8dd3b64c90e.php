<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's fair to say disgraced former senator Sam Dastyari has made a few mistakes during his years as a politician and pundit.</p>

<p>And the 37-year-old, known as 'Shanghai Sam' for his involvement in a Chinese donations scandal which eventually led to his resignation in January 2018, made a rather awkward gaffe on the Today show on Tuesday.</p>

<p>During a hot topics segment with host Karl Stefanovic and journalist Anna Caldwell, Sam put his foot in it while discussing a viral news story about a cheating husband.  </p>

<p>Whoops! Sam Dastyari (left, with Karl Stefanovic and Anna Caldwell) made a rather awkward gaffe on the Today show on Tuesday</p>

<p>Karl began: 'How's this for a wife's revenge - forcing her cheating husband to parade around their neighbourhood dressed in pink as a brutal get-back. Sam?'</p>

<p>Sam replied: 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do.</p>

<p>'And I don't think you were either, Karl.'</p>

<p>Careful what you say! During a hot topics segment, Sam put his foot in it while discussing a viral news story about a cheating husband who was forced by his wife to wear prissy pink and cycle around his neighbourhood as a punishment</p>

<p>Perhaps realising what he had just suggested about himself and Karl on national TV, Sam laughed nervously and tried to find a way to wrap things up.</p>

<p>'I mean, look, it's not going to work, it's not going to end well if that's how you're going to try and make your relationship work, good luck to you.... by the way, I thought wearing pink was okay?' he said.</p>

<p>Karl sternly clarified: 'I guess if you're a cheater, Sam.'</p>

<p>He said what?! 'Well, look, firstly as someone who's gone through a divorce, I can safely say that's not something I was forced to do,' said Sam. 'And I don't think you were either, Karl'</p>

<p>'Well, look, I mean that's certainly not me but, er, but look I think...' Sam responded, before bursting into awkward laughter.</p>

<p>Karl, 46, brushed off Sam's gaffe, and later told him and Anna: 'I thought you guys would be much lighter on that one. You guys took it very seriously. Anyway, onwards and upwards!'</p>

<p>'Too many scars there, Karl. Too many scars!' Sam added, signing off.</p>

<p>Oh, dear! Perhaps realising what he had just suggested about himself and Karl on national TV, Sam laughed nervously and tried to find a way to wrap things up</p>

<p>Sam was only joking of course, and Daily Mail Australia is not suggesting that either he or Karl has been unfaithful in the past.</p>

<p>Former Labor senator Sam clarified in January last year that his split from his wife of eight years, Helen ­Barron, was 'very amicable'.</p>

<p>Karl has also made it clear that he did not meet his now-wife, Jasmine Yarbrough, until five months after he'd split from his first wife, Cassandra Thorburn, in mid-2016.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel Nine for comment. </p>

<p>The truth: Karl has made it clear that he did not meet his now-wife, Jasmine Yarbrough, until five months after he'd split from his first wife, Cassandra Thorburn, in mid-2016</p>
