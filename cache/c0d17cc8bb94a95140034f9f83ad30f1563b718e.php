<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Smart Bluetooth scales have changed the way we weigh ourselves. While traditional models are adequate for monitoring fluctuations in your weight, the new breed of bathroom scales gives us a far more thorough analysis of our health, sharing stats like body fat, bone density and water percentage. </p>

<p>If you want to get a more accurate and in-depth look at your body profile, it might be worth taking a look at the RENPHO Body Fat Scale. On Amazon, the Bluetooth scale has amassed a whopping 41,850 reviews and an impressive average reviewer rating of 4.6 out of 5. </p>

<p>Even better, the scale is currently on sale for just £29.99, down from its usual price of £35.99</p>

<p>The RENPHO Body Fat Scale has amassed close to 42,000 reviews on Amazon with shoppers raving about its easy setup and thorough analysis </p>

<p>Smart scales like the RENPHO are becoming increasingly popular thanks to their ability to provide more accurate and comprehensive readings. Bodyweight alone is not the be-all and end-all when it comes to health, with many factors contributing to what good health means.</p>

<p>The RENPHO Body Fat Scale can offer you an impressive insight in to the composition of your body. While most smart scales can share your weight, body fat and muscle mass, the RENPHO scales show 13 essential measurements including body fat percentage, BMI, BMR, bone mass and protein. Not bad for its modest price tag. </p>

<p>While we don't all need these stats, the body fat scale allows you and your family to share one scale, which is great if you want to get the whole family or your partner involved. </p>

<p>What's more, many of the reviews have commented on how the scales give you more incentive to lose weight (if that's your goal) as they give such a detailed reading. </p>

<p>One shopper wrote: 'Excellent - better than expected and fabulous to get so many stats about visceral fat and body fat ... a real incentive to not just lose weight but increase protein or water etc - have reduced visceral fat already in 2 weeks - highly recommended!' </p>

<p>Those looking to overhaul their health and fitness will appreciate how the Renpho app syncs with your favourite fitness apps like Samsung health, Apple health, Fitbit and Google Fit so you can keep track of your stats whilst on the move. </p>

<p>The RENPHO Scale allows you to gain insight in to 13 essential measurements, and connects with fitness apps to help you set goals, save historical data and track your progress</p>

<p>Another impressed shopper wrote: 'I've just started a lifestyle change which involves healthy eating and exercise, and this scale is the perfect tool to help. I can't fault in any way. I love this. It helps so much in my goals.'</p>

<p>While it's agreed that the RENPHO Body Fat Scale is a great tool for keeping you accountable to your health goals, it's worth noting that the scales won't be as accurate as consulting a doctor.  </p>

<p>That being said, for under £30, it's an affordable way to become more aware of your body composition and understand your stats better. </p>

<p>A third reviewer wrote: 'Perfect companion during my weight loss journey. Easy to use and store. The Bluetooth connectivity adds so much value because you can have all your measurements on your phone synced via iOS's health app. It helped me to know how my body reacts to certain foods on certain days.' </p>
