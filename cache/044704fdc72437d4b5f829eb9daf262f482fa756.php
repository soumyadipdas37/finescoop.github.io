<p>It was clear from the comments, her fans liked what they saw, including her Channel Nine co-stars.  </p>

<p>Her Today show co-host Karl Stefanovic wrote, 'Wow', while wife Jasmine added, 'Go you', as words of encouragement. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Brooke Boney and entertainment guru Richard Wilkins asked Allison to bring one in to work for them.  </p>

<p>Delicious: Allison was clearly proud of herself: 'First attempt at sausage rolls - not bad hey??'</p>

<p>Tizz: Karl Stefanovic wrote, 'Wow', while wife Jasmine added, 'Go you', as words of encouragement</p>

<p>It comes amid good new for Allison and her co-host Karl Stefanovic after they managed to beat competitor Sunrise in the ratings. </p>

<p>Through the first eight days of September, Today has had more east coast viewers than Sunrise. </p>

<p>On Monday, Today delivered its closest five-city metro result compared to Sunrise since Lisa Wilkinson was Karl's co-host in 2017.  </p>

<p>Before and after: Allison showed the sausage rolls before they went into the oven </p>

<p>The show trailed in overall viewership by just 8,000. Flashback to the same Monday in May, and that gap was a whopping 94,000 people. </p>

<p>It appears the light-hearted broadcast is appealing to viewers, with Karl and Ally breathing fresh air into the TV show. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Karl got into trouble for joking about Allison smelling like garlic.   </p>

<p>The pair were speaking to Dr Penny Adams about the COVID-19 pandemic disrupting sleep patterns. </p>

<p>Ratings win: On Monday, Today delivered its closest five-city metro result compared to Sunrise since Lisa Wilkinson was Karl's co-host in 2017</p>

<p>Karl noted that many people were trying herbal medicines to switch off at night - including his co-host.</p>

<p>'Ally has got a liking for garlic which is unfortunate for the entire crew here at Channel Nine,' the 46-year-old hilariously noted.  </p>

<p>'It's a bit woofy this morning!' Karl quipped, before re-iterating: 'It's so woofy, it's not funny!'</p>
