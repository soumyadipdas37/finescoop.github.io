<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lyon fans are optimistic Barcelona and AC Milan target Memphis Depay will stay at the club after he was handed a new shirt number.</p>

<p>The Dutch forward wore the No 10 shirt for the first time on Friday night as Lyon's poor start to the Ligue 1 season continued with a goalless draw at home to Nimes.</p>

<p>New arrival Tino Kadewere has been given Depay's old No 11 shirt.</p>

<p>Memphis Depay has changed his Lyon squad number from 11 to 10 in a move supporters have taken to mean he won't be leaving for Barcelona or AC Milan</p>

<p>The Dutch winger wore the No 10 shirt for the first time as Lyon were held goalless by Nimes</p>

<p>Lyon fans interpreted the switch as an indication Depay isn't on the move, the logic being that he wouldn't request a change of number if he was planning to leave.</p>

<p>The former Manchester United player, 26, has been linked with a move to Barcelona, where compatriot Ronald Koeman has taken over as manager.</p>

<p>But Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas claimed that his counterpart at Barcelona, Josep Maria Bartomeu, told him they can't afford Depay's £28million asking price.</p>

<p>Koeman has been told he must sell players to raise the funds to sign him.</p>

<p>Lyon value Depay at £28m, which is too expensive for Barcelona on their current budget</p>

<p>Depay wore the No 11 shirt for Lyon until Friday night's game with supporters interpreting the change as a sign he will stay at the club</p>

<p>Lyon fans reacted to the shirt number announcement with delight on Twitter</p>

<p>And Spanish newspaper Diario AS reported that Milan have consequently overtaken Barcelona in the race for Depay.</p>

<p>Stefano Pioli's side are interested in bringing Depay, who is in the last year of his deal, to the club in exchange for Lucas Paqueta.</p>

<p>Depay has no intent on extending his current deal which expires in July 2021, while Paqueta is currently under control until 2023.</p>

<p>However, the shirt number switch, which comes about with previous owner of the No 10 shirt Bertrand Traore on his way out, suggests Depay could see out the final year.</p>
