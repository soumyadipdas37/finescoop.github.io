<p>Milan model: Irina Shayk was again storming the stage as she led the brightly-coloured glamour at the Versace Spring/Summer 2021 show on Saturday morning</p>

<p>Irina was looking phenomenal as she walked in the first of her incredible gowns, an under-the-sea themed number with bold beaded adornments. </p>

<p>Adding to the aquatic was her dewy make-up and wet look tresses which tied in perfectly to make her and the other models look fresh from the ocean.</p>

<p>Her cleavage stole the show in her ensembles as cups in the corsets boosted her already perky assets to up the sex appeal even further.  </p>

<p>The sensational show and collection was described in Vogue, with bosses writing: 'The Nineties called, it wants its starfish back...</p>

<p>Wow! The Russian beauty, 34, looked breathtaking in a series of typically garish looks from the Italian fashion house, with corsets helping highlight her eye-popping cleavage and tiny waist while luxury was added with the lengths of silk on the runway</p>

<p>'Splashy coral, tropical fish prints, and a whole load of rhinestone asteroidea decorated bombshell gowns on the <?php echo e('@'); ?>Versace #SS21 catwalk...</p>

<p>'Reminiscent of the “Trésor de la Mer” prints that appeared in Gianni Versace's SS92 collection, the show was something of a rebirth for Donatella Versace, who wanted to "bring the DNA of Versace to a new reality"'  </p>

<p>When she's not on the runway, Irina shares 50/50 joint legal and physical custody of her daughter Lea, three, with her ex-partner Bradley Cooper, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>And while Shayk and Cooper officially ended their four-year romance in June 2019, the amicable exes were spotted embracing each other on September 8.</p>

<p>Starfish! She stood alongside Donatella Versace at the end of show </p>

<p>Cooper is on break from filming his role as Barbra Streisand's hairdresser-turned-movie producer Jon Peters in Paul Thomas Anderson's untitled seventies San Fernando Valley-set flick.</p>

<p>The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.</p>

<p>'There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she's back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March.</p>

<p>'He's been making an effort to take projects that aren't too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he's very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he'd carry her everywhere.'</p>

<p>Wow! The sensational show and collection was described in Vogue, with bosses writing: 'The Nineties called, it wants its starfish back'</p>
