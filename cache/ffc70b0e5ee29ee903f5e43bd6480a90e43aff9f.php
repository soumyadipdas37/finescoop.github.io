<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have reportedly fended off interest from Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund to seal the signing of Alejandro Garnacho. </p>

<p>The 16-year-old, who grew up idolising Juventus star and United legend Cristiano Ronaldo, rose through the Atletico Madrid youth ranks and has been tipped to have a very bright future.</p>

<p>And according to Spanish outlet Marca, United have won the race to sign the young striker on a five-year contract. </p>

<p>Alejandro Garnacho has opted for a move to Man United over Real Madrid and Dortmund</p>

<p>Garnacho decided for a move to Old Trafford despite offers from elsewhere, including Spanish giants Real Madrid.</p>

<p>However, Atletico's relationship with their city rivals was always going to make a move challenging.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dortmund - who are playing hardball with United in their pursuit of Jadon Sancho - also showed interest in the Atletico Under-19 star.</p>

<p>Atletico were desperate to keep Garnacho at the club as they wanted to see him progress in Madrid but United managed to acquire their target.</p>

<p>Garnacho grew up idolising Portugal star and former United legend Cristiano Ronaldo</p>

<p>Garnacho is the latest young star on his way to United this summer - with the club set to confirm the signings of defenders Marc Jurado and Alvaro Fernandez.</p>

<p>The Spanish teenagers will join the Old Trafford giants' youth set-up once final clearance has been received.</p>

<p>Jurado, 16, and Fernandez, 17, are joining from Barcelona and Real Madrid respectively.</p>

<p>The highly-talented striker will reportedly sign a five-year contract at Old Trafford</p>
