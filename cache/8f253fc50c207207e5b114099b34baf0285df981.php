<p>Although she favored a more reserved look for her nighttime outing, Kylie looked as glamorous as ever in a selfie she posted earlier in the day.</p>

<p>She showed off her famous pout while highlighting her voluminous lightened locks, which cascaded over her shoulders and down her chest.</p>

<p>The reality star showed off a bit of her cleavage in a gray plaid top while gazing longingly into the camera.</p>

<p>Blast from the past: Kylie wasn't as happy about a throwback photo from 2009 that Kim Kardashian posted featuring the two plus Kendall Jenner and Khloé Kardashian</p>

<p>Not feeling it: 'delete this immediately,' Kylie curtly commented on the photo</p>

<p>Kylie was looking at her best in the photo, but she wasn't happy about a throwback photo that her older sister Kim Kardashian, 39, shared on Friday.</p>

<p>The picture was from 2009, when Kylie would have been 11 or 12, and featured her off to the left side around a restaurant dining table with Kim and her other sisters Kendall Jenner, 24, and Khloé Kardashian, 36.</p>

<p>The picture was significantly altered and much lighter than the original, and Khloé's nose also seemed to have been reshaped in the editing.</p>

<p>But Kylie didn't seem to care for how she looked as a tween in the image. </p>

<p>'delete this immediately,' she commented on the photo. </p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>kyliejenner should I Diddy crop you out?' replied Kim, jokingly referencing a photo from the 2017 Met Gala in which Sean 'Diddy' Combs cropped her and Kendall out of a picture.</p>

<p>Kylie responded to Kim with 'absolutely.' </p>
