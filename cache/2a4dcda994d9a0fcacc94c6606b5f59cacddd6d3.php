<p>Brought evidence: Lisa Rinna was determined to prove that Denise Richards had an affair with Brandi Glanville during the third and final RHOBH reunion episode Wednesday on Bravo</p>

<p>'Wow. Wow. Wow,' moaned show newcomer Garcelle Beauvais, 53.</p>

<p>Denise maintained that she and Brandi were just 'acquaintances' and suggested that Brandi's screenshots of the text messages were different from her own.</p>

<p>'Hey, Rinna, you better be careful saying this, because yours will be shown, too,' she told her friend of 20 years.</p>

<p>'Are you threatening me?' Lisa asked.</p>

<p>Strong denial: Denise Richards has strongly denied having an affair with Brandi</p>

<p>Shocking moment: In a shocking moment, Lisa held up a thick stack of text messages between the women, saying, 'I have 'em right here if you guys wanna go through 'em'</p>

<p>'I'm telling you the truth,' Denise said. 'If you wanna play this game, we can do it.'</p>

<p>Reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, asked Denise if she would show her texts with Brandi for comparison's sake.</p>

<p>'Absolutely,' Denise affirmed. 'Is Rinna willing to let me show my text messages with her?'</p>

<p>Good question: Reunion host Andy Cohen, 52, asked Denise if she would show her texts with Brandi for comparison's sake</p>

<p>'It's not about me, and those are private,' Lisa whimpered, as Denise countered, 'It's not about me and Brandi… this is about me with all of you.'</p>

<p>She later softened a bit, wiping away a tear as she mourned a lost friendship. </p>

<p>Lisa, however, was not done, alluding to an old rumor that Denise had 'stolen' actress Heather Locklear's husband Richard Sambora, 61, and once invited a hooker to dinner.</p>

<p>Not done: Lisa, however, was not done, alluding to an old rumor that Denise had 'stolen' actress Heather Locklear's husband Richard Sambora, 61, and once invited a hooker to dinner</p>

<p>Andy had an important question, asking Lisa, 'If you were to do it over again, would you give Denise a heads-up about Brandi's accusation?'</p>

<p>'I wouldn't have had Denise not come on the show if I were to do it over again,' Lisa said, leading Dorit Kemsley, 44, to sigh, 'F***.'</p>

<p>As the show opened, the ladies were already sparring, with Denise angry at Teddi Mellencamp-Arroyave, 39, for asking her about Brandi in public.</p>

<p>Do over: 'I wouldn't have had Denise not come on the show if I were to do it over again,' Lisa told Andy</p>

<p>'Teddi, you are the daughter of a famous father,' Denise said. 'The fact that you would even bring that up in a group dinner, I think is really f<strong><em>ing s</em></strong>ty.'</p>

<p>When Lisa backed Teddi, Denise snapped, 'She said a lot about your family. Do you want me to throw that out there?'</p>

<p>Teddi asked Denise how she knew so much about Brandi if they weren't pals.</p>

<p>Sharp query: Teddi Mellencamp asked Denise how she knew so much about Brandi if they weren't pals</p>

<p>Denise clutched a drink and said, 'It was the first time I met her when I signed on to do the f***ing show through a mutual agent. She spilled—talked—diarrhea of the mouth. I never repeated it. That is the truth.'</p>

<p>The Starship Troopers actress explained that Brandi had called her 'out of the blue' and tagged along with her to Kyle Richards's black-and-white gala.</p>

<p>'Aaron was like, ''No f***ing way,'' which, I didn't even ask him…' she went on.</p>

<p>Tagged along: The Starship Troopers actress explained that Brandi had called her 'out of the blue' and tagged along with her to Kyle Richards's black-and-white gala</p>

<p>'He said ''No f***ing way,'' that he wouldn't even come, but you didn't even ask him?' Andy puzzled.</p>

<p>'No,' Denise said. 'He doesn't like Brandi. She's a trainwreck, and she's not stable, and she drinks a lot. The last time he saw her prior to Kyle's was when she asked to come do the podcast…'</p>

<p>Denise was referring to an event at which they were alleged to have hooked up, and said Aaron, 48, was there the whole time.</p>

<p>Together again: Dorit Kemsley, Sutton Stracke, Lisa, Kyle Richards, Denise, Teddi, Garcelle Beauvais and Erika Girardi gathered virtually for the season 10 reunion on Bravo</p>

<p>'I do not have an open marriage,' Denise declared. 'If I had an open marriage, I would say it.'</p>

<p>Kyle, 51, said Denise's behavior seemed dishonest, and Denise said she thought the whole discussion had been laid to rest during the cast's Rome trip, asking 'What happened after that?'</p>

<p>'You stopped showing up,' Kyle replied. 'You said. ''I'm not coming to the final party'',' you stood up Garcelle…'</p>

<p>Not honest: Kyle, 51, said Denise's behavior seemed dishonest, and Denise said she thought the whole discussion had been laid to rest during the cast's Rome trip</p>

<p>'I have to move on, or I'm gonna die,' Andy groaned.</p>

<p>New cast member Sutton Stracke spoke up. 'I didn't know Denise at all in 2018. But I did hear a rumor from one person that this was going on. So either Brandi is lying and she's been lying… or she has manipulated you and used you.'</p>

<p>Denise said she hadn't known Brandi in 2018, which Lisa said was untrue.</p>

<p>Old rumor: New cast member Sutton, bottom left, spoke up saying, 'I didn't know Denise at all in 2018. But I did hear a rumor from one person that this was going on. So either Brandi is lying and she's been lying… or she has manipulated you and used you'</p>

<p>'The whole f***ing thing is about you and Brandi,' Lisa spat. 'Why? Is she being muzzled? Did you send a cease-and-desist to Brandi to shut her up?'</p>

<p>Andy told Denise, 'Your lawyer threatened to file a cease-and-desist against production.'</p>

<p>'No, no, no,' Denise said. 'The cease-and-desist was against Brandi, to make her tell the truth to all of you.'</p>

<p>Legal notice: 'No, no, no,' Denise said. 'The cease-and-desist was against Brandi, to make her tell the truth to all of you'</p>

<p>Andy then asked Lisa to imagine a scenario in which Denise had just been trying to protect her marriage, wondering 'What then?'</p>

<p>'I would think that if we were such good friends, she would have come to me and said, ''Lisa, this happened, please help me'',' Lisa suggested.</p>

<p>Garcelle laughed. 'How can she come to you? All you do is attack her every time you see her!'</p>

<p>Main subject: The affair allegations and the fractured friendship between Denise and Lisa dominated the final reunion episode</p>

<p>Denise swore that she had told the truth, and no one believed her anyway.</p>

<p>Andy said Bravo had hoped Aaron would show up to the reunion, and Denise explained that it would have been a 'no-win situation' for him.</p>

<p>The two of them had been filming her soap opera together lately; she and Aaron shared love scenes to preserve others' safety during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>No win: Andy said Bravo had hoped Aaron would show up to the reunion, and Denise explained that it would have been a 'no-win situation' for him</p>

<p>Teddi said that when she re-watched season 10, she was often 'uncomfortable' with the way Aaron spoke to Denise.</p>

<p>At one challenging party, for example, Denise dragged Aaron away to keep him quiet and he said he was 'going to crush' her 'f***ing hand.'</p>

<p>Denise said Aaron claimed not to remember saying it, and added, 'I don't know why I would say that, because I'm afraid of you.'</p>

<p>Show veteran: Kyle has been on RHOBH since its premiere in October 2010, while Denise was one and done after season 10</p>

<p>Lisa wondered why Aaron was afraid, and Denise said he had been joking.</p>

<p>Andy asked Denise how Lisa had changed over the course of their friendship.</p>

<p>'I need to eat something before I answer this question,' Denise said.</p>

<p>Meal break: 'I need to eat something before I answer this question,' Denise said</p>

<p>She then got up and walked off as the other women goggled.</p>

<p>'We're almost done, Denise,' Andy pleaded. 'We're almost done.'</p>

<p>Seconds later, Denise returned, high heels in hand, clutching a script.</p>

<p>'I'm done,' she said. 'I have to go to work tomorrow. I have 48 pages….'</p>

<p>Over it: 'I'm done,' she said. 'I have to go to work tomorrow. I have 48 pages….'</p>

<p>Denise emphasized to Andy that she had enjoyed doing the show and getting to know the other women, but she didn't like how Lisa had 'turned' on her.</p>

<p>Lise then recalled Denise's insistence that the RHOBH cast stop speaking about sex around her kids, and called her a 'hypocrite.'</p>

<p>Lisa noted that Denise once invited a prostitute dating her ex, Charlie Sheen, to Thanksgiving dinner.</p>

<p> Called out: Lise then recalled Denise's insistence that the RHOBH cast stop speaking about sex around her kids, and called her a 'hypocrite.'</p>

<p>'Shame on me for asking her to come in for a square meal,' Denise shrugged.</p>

<p>Lisa argued again that Denise and Brandi couldn't just be 'acquaintances,' saying she couldn't 'reconcile' it with their texts.</p>

<p>'Remember those words,' Denise warned. 'You told me a lot of stuff about her.'</p>

<p>Relationship debate: Lisa argued again that Denise and Brandi couldn't just be 'acquaintances,' saying she couldn't 'reconcile' it with their texts</p>

<p>Lisa admitted she didn't like Brandi, but said she wanted to give her a chance.</p>

<p>She wondered why Denise hadn't called Brandi to talk right away, and Denise said there was no need for them to hash it out.</p>

<p>Denise and Lisa hadn't spoken or texted in six months, and Lisa bristled at the suggestion that she'd somehow been a bad friend.</p>

<p>'You know, I go back to when she was friends with Heather Locklear...' Lisa mused.</p>

<p>Not talking: The reunion revealed that Lisa and Denise have not talked in months</p>

<p>'She was friends with my ex-husband,' Denise seethed. 'Really?'</p>

<p>Andy was desperate to be clued in, and Lisa urged him to Google it.</p>

<p>As the Daily Mail revealed on Tuesday, actress Heather, 58, claimed Denise stole her husband away from her in 2006.</p>

<p>No clue: Andy was desperate to be clued in, and Lisa urged him to Google it.</p>

<p>Asked if she would have changed anything about the season, Lisa said no.</p>

<p>Andy lamented the state of Lisa and Denise's friendship, recounting how Lisa had once encouraged him to cast the former Wild Things star.</p>

<p>Denise wiped away tears, saying she'd come to the reunion hoping to resolve things with the cast, but 'some of the women don't want to do that.'</p>

<p>Rough time: Andy lamented the state of Lisa and Denise's friendship, recounting how Lisa had once encouraged him to cast the former Wild Things star</p>

<p>Elsewhere on the show, Andy took questions from callers.</p>

<p>One asked Lisa why she wouldn't let her daughter Amelia Gray, 19, be a go-go dancer, since she already parades 'half-nude on Instagram.'</p>

<p>'Well, gosh,' Lisa said. 'I guess there really isn't any difference, is there?'</p>

<p>'[She makes] a lot more money, that's the difference,' joked Erika Girardi, 49.</p>

<p>Caller questions: Elsewhere on the show, Andy took questions from callers.</p>

<p>Erika had just done a Broadway run as Roxie Hart in Chicago, which Andy said was attended by singer Janet Jackson, designer Marc Jacobs and other fans.</p>

<p>Because of the COVID-19 epidemic, the show shut down early, and Erika's husband, Tom Girardi, 81, never saw it.</p>

<p>Most of her castmates had, though, with Dorit flying from Mexico to get there.</p>

<p>Denise said she hadn't gone because she hadn't known about it in time, to which Andy said, 'I was told that it was at the time you were suing us.'</p>

<p>Fan favorite: Erika had just done a Broadway run as Roxie Hart in Chicago, which Andy said was attended by singer Janet Jackson, designer Marc Jacobs and other fans</p>

<p>'I wasn't suing anybody,' Denise insisted. 'I sent a cease-and-desist to Brandi, and we also sent something to Bravo to ask if they could remove the footage because she was not a cast member, and it wasn't true.'</p>

<p>Garcelle claimed she didn't go because she was 'deathly scared of small planes,' then confessed she'd had to work and watch her kids.</p>

<p>As the show ended, the cast raised a glass to each other in a toast.</p>

<p>'May the only pain in your life be champagne,' Dorit declared, shaking her Gucci glass full of Gucci ice cubes.</p>

<p>Final toast: 'May the only pain in your life be champagne,' Dorit declared during the final toast, shaking her Gucci glass full of Gucci ice cubes</p>
