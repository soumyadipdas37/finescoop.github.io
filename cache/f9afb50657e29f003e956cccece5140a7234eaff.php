<p>Two cases are from returned travellers currently staying in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>NSW Health said it was investigating how the staff member became infected.</p>

<p>New South Wales has reported three new COVID-19 cases overnight (pictured, two women wear face masks in Circular Quay)</p>

<p>The other case is a staff member at Concord Hospital, in Sydney's inner west</p>

<p>'The case cared for patients with COVID-19 and further investigation is underway to identify how the infection was acquired. </p>

<p>'Contact tracing is underway.'</p>

<p>Four people are currently being treated in intensive care units with two connected to respirators.  </p>

<p>NSW will soon welcome an extra 500 weekly returned travellers, but an agreement to reopen its Queensland border appears a way off amid state tensions.</p>

<p>Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been at loggerheads with Queensland counterpart Annastacia Palaszczuk over the border issue for months.</p>

<p>Queensland announced on Friday ACT residents will be able to fly into the Sunshine State from September 25, but those in NSW cannot as it's still considered a hotspot.</p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian said all border talks with Ms Palaszczuk had ceased again, but Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles denied any communication breakdown.</p>

<p>He said Queensland's chief health officer speaks with her NSW counterpart almost every day and he speaks with his counterpart most days too.</p>

<p>It came as NSW agreed to accept an additional 500 returned travellers each week into its hotel quarantine system.</p>

<p>The increase will start from September 27, and takes the state's intake to about 3000 a week.</p>

<p>It followed Ms Berejiklian's declaration she'd be happy to accept the extra travellers if Queensland and Western Australia doubled their intake.</p>

<p>Those states will scale up capacity by 500 returnees per week more slowly than NSW.</p>

<p>Ms Berejiklian has for months been urging the other states to lift their game and share the load.</p>

<p>NSW had six new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, with just one acquired locally and linked to a known cluster.</p>

<p>Five of the cases were returned overseas travellers in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>The locally acquired case is a household contact of another one who attended Liverpool Hospital and was in isolation while infectious.</p>

<p>There are now 21 cases linked to the Liverpool Hospital dialysis cluster. </p>

<p>More to come </p>
