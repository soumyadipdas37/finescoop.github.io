<p>The 56-year-old former NBA star, who spent 20 years as a power forward for some of the league's biggest teams, failed to wow the judges with his scattered cha cha this week.</p>

<p>He and partner Emma Slater, 31, earned just 15 points for their dance to the Luther Vandross song Never Too Much.</p>

<p>Early exit: Charles Oakley became the first contestant to be eliminated Tuesday on season 29 of Dancing With The Stars</p>

<p>That left him tied at the bottom of the DWTS leaderboard with Carole Baskin, 59, a star of the Netflix documentary Tiger King.</p>

<p>Carole survived after judges Carrie Ann Inaba and Derek Hough voted to save her. </p>

<p>The big cat rights activist tried to move up in the rankings this week, yet scored just 16 points for her Viennese waltz to Tom Jones' What's New Pussycat, an on-the-nose choice.</p>

<p>Carole was still happy with her score, and the judges' comments that she was 'shining' onstage, especially since she'd gone through such a tough year.</p>

<p>Bottom two: Carole Baskin finished in the bottom two, but was saved by the judges</p>

<p>She told partner Pasha Pashkov, 35, that all the 'negative attention' from the documentary hurt her family, and her daughter no longer read the news.</p>

<p>'I've seen what the media can do to you,' Carole said. 'And I hate that I try even harder to be strong in their presence. I keep it inside and wait until everybody's gone before I can break down. I don't know how to make it better.'</p>

<p>Carole hoped that being on DWTS would help her daughter look at her more positively, and cautioned her family she'd be crying on camera.</p>
