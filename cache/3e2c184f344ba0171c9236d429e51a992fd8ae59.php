<p>'He’s definitely a true Aussie battler,' Mr Bartlett's granddaughter Lauren Penrose told 7NEWS.</p>

<p>'Always surprises us and always beats the odds.' </p>

<p>The centenarian spent his 100 birthday on June 27 at St Vincent's private hospital, where he celebrated with nurses and enjoyed cake. </p>

<p>He finally left this week after spending 42 days in hospital, the Herald Sun reports. </p>

<p>Ms Penrose said her family will be forever grateful to the staff that cared for him. </p>

<p>'They may be someone’s grandfather, and they maybe 100 years old, but they’re part of someone’s family, and they’ve got loved ones and they really truly do matter,' she said.</p>

<p>Mr Bartlett's return home comes days after two other Melbourne seniors defeated the virus. </p>

<p>Vic Cornell, 95, and his partner Jean Schofield, 87, were released on Monday after successfully fighting off the illness following a ten-week stint in Healesville &amp; District Hospital. </p>
