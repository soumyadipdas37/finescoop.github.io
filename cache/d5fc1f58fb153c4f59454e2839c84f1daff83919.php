<p>But is still keen on a forward and Juventus want to bring Kean back to the club after the striker endured a difficult first season at Everton.</p>

<p>Everton have been offered the chance to sign Napoli forward Arkadiusz Milik this summer</p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti's priority is upgrading his defence as he is keen on signing a centre back</p>

<p>The 20-year-old signed for the Toffees last summer in a £25million deal but struggled to make an impact.</p>

<p>Italy international Kean has started just six Premier League matches and scored only two goals. </p>

<p>The low point was reached when interim manager Duncan Ferguson substituted him just 19 minutes after bringing him on against Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>But much depends on whether Moise Kean returns to Juventus who Everton bought him from</p>

<p>However, according to goal.com, former club Juventus want to offer Kean an escape route and get his career back on track. </p>

<p>They report that the Italian champions wish to sign Kean on loan without an obligation to buy.  </p>
