<p>That looks painful! The Bachelor's Kaitlyn Hoppe (left) sported a number of bruises on her legs while arriving at the Burleigh Pavilion beachfront bar on the Gold Coast on Sunday</p>

<p>A number of purple marks were visible on Kaitlyn's knees, shins and calves as she paraded her trim pins in a stunning floral mini dress.</p>

<p>The bruises didn't seem to bother her, however, as she beamed with happiness while chatting to a female pal.</p>

<p>At one stage, she was spotted texting someone on her phone, possibly arranging to meet up later in the evening. </p>

<p>Ouch! A number of purple marks were visible on Kaitlyn's knees, shins and calves</p>

<p>Glam gal: Kaitlyn paraded her trim pins in a stunning floral mini dress, and didn't seem to be bothered by the bruises on display</p>

<p>Kaitlyn looked every inch the reality TV debutante in her thigh-grazing frock, which she paired with strappy nude heels. </p>

<p>She styled her long blonde hair loosely, and opted for a glossy makeup look and lashings of dark mascara. </p>

<p>Last month, a heated argument between Kaitlyn and co-star Roxi Kenny stunned viewers of The Bachelor.</p>

<p>Oh, so stylish! Kaitlyn looked every inch the reality TV debutante in her thigh-grazing floral frock, which she paired with strappy nude heels</p>

<p>A jealous Roxi, 29, became furious after discovering that Kaitlyn had kissed leading man Locky Gilbert at the cocktail party.</p>

<p>At one stage, she said within earshot of Kaitlyn: 'I'm sorry but I think that's really rude to everyone else. You kissed someone at a cocktail party.' </p>

<p>'That's classless. She's Gold Coast trash,' she added.</p>

<p>Feud: Last month, a heated argument between Kaitlyn and Roxi Kenny stunned viewers of The Bachelor</p>

<p>'This little silly b<strong><em>h over here is saying she packed on with someone. It's disgusting. The b</em></strong>h is a sl*t!'</p>

<p>As things became heated later on, Roxi labelled Kaitlyn 'Malibu Barbie gone wrong', before screaming over and over again that she was 'trash'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kaitlyn repeatedly held her hand up in front of Roxi's face and told her to 'go cry', which only aggravated her further.</p>

<p>Heated: As things became heated later on, Roxi labelled Kaitlyn 'Malibu Barbie gone wrong', before screaming over and over again that she was 'trash'</p>

<p>Viewers had plenty to say about the dramatic confrontation, with many fans picking sides on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Both Roxi and Kaitlyn were out of line tonight but I'm team Malibu Barbie, what a crack up,' tweeted one viewer.</p>

<p>'Mmmm kind of on Roxi's side, Kaitlyn is being horrendous,' another added.  </p>

<p>Hot stuff: Kaitlyn is a real estate agent and an Instagram model. She once partied at the infamous Candyshop Mansion in 2018 wearing lacy lingerie</p>

<p>Another sarcastic fan wrote: 'I'm with Roxi... what was Kaitlyn thinking kissing the guy whose romantic attention she is trying to secure?'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one disgruntled viewer claimed the only losers in this situation were the fans who had been subjected to the argument.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Lucky girl! Kaitlyn was awarded a one-on-one date with Locky on episode two of the show after entering the series as an intruder</p>
