<p>Sophie currently lives in Wicklow with her boyfriend, Polish jazz musician Count Kaz Balinski-Jundzill.</p>

<p>The Celebrity Big Brother star has been practising yoga to keep fit and sane in lockdown — and suggests others do the same.  </p>

<p>What a babe! Sophie proved she's still got it earlier this month as she uploaded images of herself sunbathing during her scenic trip to the South of France</p>

<p>Sophie prioritises her health and wellness following her highly publicised battle with drink and drugs. </p>

<p>Yet speaking to The Daily Mail in 2015, the media personality dismissed all this as 'light years from where I am now.' </p>

<p>She explained: 'I was very unhappy [in my 20s]. I had no control over who I was or how I looked.</p>

<p>'I was a model but at some point modelling became only one part of what was required of us, and suddenly to be successful we had to be celebrities. </p>

<p>'It’s not something that came naturally. I was terrible at being famous.'  </p>
