<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the heart-warming moment a stray dog was caught on camera interrupting a street performance to comfort an actor pretending to be hurt.</p>

<p>Numan Ertuğrul Uzunsoy was lying on the floor and feigning injury during a theatrical scene in Turkey.</p>

<p>But it wasn't long before an inquisitive canine wandered on to the stage, curled up beside him and started licking his face - much to the delight of the audience.</p>

<p>In the clip, which was recorded earlier this month, Mr Uzunsoy can be seen in a striped shirt, black trousers and leather boots alongside the rest of his troupe.</p>

<p>Two of his fellow actors lower him down toward the ground as he fakes an injury and begins breathing heavily. </p>

<p>The stray dog, which appears to be a cross-breed, then appears at the top of the screen with his tail wagging before meandering across the impromptu stage toward Mr Uzunsoy.</p>

<p>It sits down beside the actor's head before nuzzling excitedly at his chin.</p>

<p>Mr Uzunsoy reaches toward it as another of the troupe attempts to usher the dog gently out of the way. </p>

<p>Members of the audience seem unfazed by the interruption and even begin to clap as the dog rolls on to its back and is petted by the cast of street performers.</p>

<p>He is eventually picked up and moved off stage so that the show can go on. </p>

<p>'The character I played was injured and in great pain. He'd fallen off a horse, and was breathing hard,' Mr Uzunsoy told The Dodo.</p>

<p>He said that he was unaware what was going on at first but soon realised he had made a four-legged friend.</p>

<p>The performer added: 'I was very happy when I felt the dog's kisses. I was very touched. He was like an angel who wanted to help me. </p>

<p>'It was a very emotional moment for me. I was not expecting it. My cast mates loved the dog, and the audience was very happy. Everyone cheered.' </p>

<p>Mr Uzunsoy said he now hopes that he will cross paths with the dog again in the future so he can help the stray find a home.</p>
