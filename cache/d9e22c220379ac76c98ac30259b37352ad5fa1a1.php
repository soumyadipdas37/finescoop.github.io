<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An obese paedophile who sexually abused several boys while teaching in Tasmania won't spend any time behind bars because of his poor health.</p>

<p>Peter John O'Neill, 61, was employed at three schools across the state from 1980-91 when he committed the abuse.</p>

<p>O'Neill befriended one of the boys, who was aged as young as 10, while working as his personal art tutor.</p>

<p>Peter John O'Neill, 61, was employed at three schools across the state from 1980-91 when he committed the abuse</p>

<p>Former students of Dominic College in Tasmania (pictured) posted to a Facebook group, with one saying, 'Nothing will give back what he took, but he must pay in some way'</p>

<p>While on an overnight trip during a wild storm, the boy told O'Neill he was feeling scared.</p>

<p>O'Neill gave the boy a back massage in bed and then sexually abused him.</p>

<p>O'Neill, who now lives in Canberra, previously pleaded guilty to six counts of indecent assault and one count of penetrative sexual abuse of a young person.</p>

<p>He weighs 140kg, is incontinent and suffers severe degeneration of the spine, spinal stenosis, chronic pain and sleep apnea.</p>

<p>He has a full-time carer and needs help to stand up, wash and other elements of basic hygiene.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Alan Blow said O'Neill deserved to be jailed but his only option was to deliver a wholly suspended sentence as there was 'no prospect' of him being brought to Tasmania.</p>

<p>O'Neill befriended one of the boys, who was aged as young as 10, while working as his personal art tutor</p>

<p>'Although I cannot impose the penalty he deserves, his life now is probably far more miserable than the lives of most prisoners,' Justice Blow told the Supreme Court in Hobart on Wednesday.</p>

<p>O'Neill is unable to travel on normal flights or any significant distance by car, while specialist medical transport by air would cost up to $40,000.</p>

<p>Justice Blow said O'Neill could not be locked up interstate and didn't have the money to pay a fine.</p>

<p>He said a home detention order was useless because O'Neill is unable to leave his house without assistance.</p>

<p>Justice Blow said O'Neill had impacted his victims' education irreversibly and many had experienced problems with anxiety, homelessness, holding down jobs, depression and drugs.</p>

<p>O'Neill was sick in bed when he coaxed one 15-year-old boy to hug him. He then abused him.</p>

<p>That victim didn't come forward until his 40s because he felt he was to blame.</p>

<p>Justice Blow sentenced O'Neill to five years' jail, wholly suspended.</p>
