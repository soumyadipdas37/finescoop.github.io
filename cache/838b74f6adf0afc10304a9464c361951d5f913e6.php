<p>Yazmin then took out a notebook and read aloud: 'Oh James, James, I'm sick of these wine games.  Lockie, you're looking a little bit stocky. Why are you always so cocky? </p>

<p>'You look good in pink, but your feet really stink.  You've got good chat but sometimes you're a t**t. </p>

<p>'I love your golden tan, you're a very handsome man. I love the way you look at me like a character from Glee. </p>

<p>'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids.'  </p>

<p>Yazmin and James are back on and were spotting sharing a steamy kiss as they filmed with their co-stars on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Yazmin dumped Lockie over claims he had cheated on her while they were on a romantic holiday together in Turkey, and has said she still doesn't trust him but wouldn't say 'no' if he popped the question.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, the brunette beauty said: 'We are trying to take things really slow but I know what I am like.</p>

<p>'I do love him and if he did propose to me I would say yes and marry him. I still don't trust him but I do trust him more this time, which is strange because he messed up. But I do believe he has changed.'</p>

<p>Yazmin read out: 'Oh James, James, I'm sick of these wine games. Lockie, you're looking a little bit stocky. Why are you always so cocky?'</p>

<p>Fun: Amber and Dan laughed as she read: 'You look good in pink, but your feet really stink. You've got good chat but sometimes you're a t**t' </p>

<p>Yazmin also revealed that the couple are now having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom after starting during lockdown, which is helping get their broken relationship back on track. </p>

<p>She added that her family and friends around her are still sceptical about the reunion but that she needs to 'prove everyone wrong'.</p>

<p>Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.</p>

<p>Yazmin read: 'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids' </p>

<p>They looked as loved up as ever, showing signs they were on the road to returning to a fully fledged romance, with a source saying 'sparks are flying' between them.</p>

<p>At the time a source told The Sun: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.</p>

<p>'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'</p>

<p>The Only Way Is Essex airs on ITVBe on Wednesday at 9pm. </p>

<p>Love: It comes after Yazmin revealed she would marry James if he proposed tomorrow</p>
