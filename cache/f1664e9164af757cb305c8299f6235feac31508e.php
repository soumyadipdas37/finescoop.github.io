<p>A cook and food author has revealed the six common mistakes home cooks make, and how to avoid them in your kitchen (stock image)</p>

<p>You should rest your meat for half the time it took to cook it in order to bring out the best flavours (stock image)</p>

<li>Not seasoning properly</li>
</ol>

<p>The first thing Helen said you need to be aware of is that you might not be seasoning your dishes properly. </p>

<p>'Food tastes amazing at restaurants because chefs season generously and at the correct stage,' Helen told Good Food.</p>

<p>She said while salt is the 'greatest flavour enhancer', all too often people wait until right at the end and so miss their chance to season their food from within. </p>

<p>Some foods that should always be seasoned include pasta, green vegetables and meat, and you should season them as you start cooking.</p>

<p>Doing this will amplify the flavours, 'soften your proteins' and boost any sweetness in your vegetables.</p>

<ol start="2">
<li>Not adding acid</li>
</ol>

<p>The second mistake home cooks make is not adding acid to their dishes.</p>

<p>'A little squeeze of lemon juice or a splash of vinegar will bring a dish to life and make the rest of the flavours "pop",' Helen said.</p>

<p>She added that not only are does acid brighten food, but it 'tenderises proteins' by helping to break down the collagen in slow-cooked meat. </p>

<p>Common forms of 'acid' you could add to your dishes include citrus juice, vinegar, wine, tomatoes and yoghurt. </p>

<p>Red or white wine vinegar works especially well in a salad dressing.</p>

<p>While we are all sometimes guilty of cooking in a rush, that doesn't mean you should quickly throw everything into your pan and over-crowd it (stock image)</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Over-crowding the pan</li>
</ol>

<p>While we are all sometimes guilty of cooking in a rush, that doesn't mean you should quickly throw everything into your pan and over-crowd it.</p>

<p>'Over-crowding the pan will steam your food, making it soggy and pale instead of crisp and caramelised,' Helen said. </p>

<p>Instead, you need to focus on even heat distribution and surface area to ensure both your meat and vegetables are cooked correctly.   </p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Not properly resting meat</li>
</ol>

<p>'Resting meat after cooking relaxes the muscle fibres and allows the juices to run back into the meat for a juicier and more flavoursome result,' Helen said. </p>

<p>The cook said the general rule of thumb is to rest something for half the time you spent cooking it.</p>

<p>It can be all too easy to burn garlic, when you take into consideration the fact that it only needs around 30 seconds in the pan to cook (stock image)</p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Burning your garlic </li>
</ol>

<p>It can be all too easy to burn garlic, when you take into consideration the fact that it only needs around 30 seconds in the pan to cook.</p>

<p>Helen explained that while onions, celery and carrots are all more dense and therefore need longer, the same cannot be said of garlic. </p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Not enough good quality fat  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, the chef said good quality fats are absolutely vital, whether you're cooking a soup, a cake or a one-pot braise.</p>

<p>Typically, Helen cooks with extra Virgin olive oil and coconut oil, but she also uses avocado oil, macadamia, peanut and roasted sesame oil to enhance a dish.</p>
