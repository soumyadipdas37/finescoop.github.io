<p>Painful: 'I've spoken to the people who kept their jobs. I know how difficult it would have been for those guys for them to reach out. It felt like the Hunger Games to be honest,' he said</p>

<p>Difficult: 'We had a criteria shown to us when it was presented to all the Mornings and Afternoons announcers... it was presented to us the criteria we fell short in,' he said</p>

<p>He added that in that time, he had prepared himself for the worst - saying that he was an 'anxious' person who always worked through the worst case scenario. </p>

<p>'I've made peace with what's happened because I've been preparing for it for so long,' he said.   </p>

<p>'I was one of a handful of good people who was made redundant from the radio station.</p>

<p>'I was preparing myself mentally… but nothing can prepare you to hear those words.' </p>

<p>He added: 'My hands have been randomly shaking for the past couple of days.</p>
