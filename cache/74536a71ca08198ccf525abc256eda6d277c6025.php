<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are preparing a last gasp bid to prise Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund this week.</p>

<p>Dortmund have been adamant in recent weeks that the £108million-rated England international will stay with them for the season amid concerns United do not have the resources available to test the Germans resolve in this window.</p>

<p>United have seen potential deals for Real Madrid's Gareth Bale and Aston Villa's Jack Grealish falter already this summer and the Old Trafford club are under increasing pressure from disgruntled supporters to bring in a quality forward before the window closes.</p>

<p>Manchester United are preparing a last-gasp bid to sign Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>They are expected to offer around £65m plus achievable add ons up to £90m for Sancho</p>

<p>The need for a better forward in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad will demand United's main focus</p>

<p>Indeed, while talks continue with Porto for left back Alex Telles, it is the need for a better forward that will demand their main focus this week.</p>

<p>They are expected to offer around £65m plus achievable add ons up to £90m for Sancho.</p>

<p>Should they fail to tempt Dortmund to sell they will revert to other options.</p>

<p>United are among clubs to have been linked with Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik and Bournemouth's Josh King while Ivan Perisic of Inter and Douglas Costa of Juventus have also been discussed.</p>

<p>Andreas Pereira's proposed departure to Lazio could free up some funds as would Chris Smalling's sale to Roma but United's asking prices have proved problematic as they look to streamline their squad and offload the likes of Sergio Romero, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones.</p>

<p>United have seen a potential deal for Real Madrid's Gareth Bale falter already this summer</p>

<p>Talks will continue between the Old Trafford outfit and Porto for left back Alex Telles</p>

<p>If Dortmund refuse to Sancho, United will revert to other options including Arkadiusz Milik</p>
