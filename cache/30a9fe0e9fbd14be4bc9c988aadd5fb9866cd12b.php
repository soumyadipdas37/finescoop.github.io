<p>Legs for days: Amanda Holden pulled off yet another showstopping look on Wednesday as she put on a very leggy display while arriving at Global studios to present her Heart FM show</p>

<p>Amanda oozed confidence as she strutted down the street in her eye-catching look, teaming her skirt with a white T-shirt and a stylish leather jacket.</p>

<p>The Britain's Got Talent host boosted her height with a simple pair of black heels, while she carried her essentials in a mustard yellow handbag.</p>

<p>Amanda wore her blonde locks in loose waves, while she shielded her eyes from the sun with tortoiseshell sunglasses. </p>

<p>The star flashed a huge smile as she made her way into the building as she prepared to once again reunite with pal Ashley Roberts. </p>

<p>Fashionista: The broadcaster, 49, flashed her slender pins in a leopard print mini skirt as she made a very fashionable entrance at the London studio</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Amanda confirmed that COVID-19 won't put a stop to Britain's Got Talent's return in 2021 - which will be the show's 15th season</p>

<p>She also pointed out that she turns 50 next year - and has laid out her ideas for a joint celebration.</p>

<p>Amanda said: 'I’m really excited because 2021 is happening in whatever format it’s going to be in,' she confirmed. 'That will be 15 years we’ve been going - and I’ve been there for all of them!</p>

<p>'So hopefully, there’ll be a party!'</p>

<p>Looking good: Amanda oozed confidence as she strutted down the street in her eye-catching look, teaming her skirt with a white T-shirt and a stylish leather jacket</p>

<p>Strutting her stuff: The Britain's Got Talent host boosted her height with a simple pair of black heels, while she carried her essentials in a mustard yellow handbag</p>

<p>She added: 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!'</p>

<p>Amanda and her co-judges - Simon Cowell, David Walliams and Alesha Dixon - returned to screens this weekend for the first time since the pandemic put a stop to production on the current series.</p>

<p>The show resumes over September and October after a lengthy wait, with social distancing now in place and no studio audience.</p>

<p>Work it: Amanda wore her blonde locks in loose waves, while she shielded her eyes from the sun with tortoiseshell sunglasses</p>

<p>The Kiss Me Kate actress said: 'Being a meter apart will be annoying because we’re a very emotive judging panel and we hug one another if an act has been particularly emotional and set one of us off crying.</p>

<p>'It’s going to feel very odd explaining to all our kids that they can’t come and hang out backstage.'</p>

<p>The semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October.</p>

<p>As usual, Ant and Dec will host, and Ashley Banjo will replace Simon at the judges’ desk, after the head judge broke his back in LA three weeks ago during a bike accident.</p>

<p>Comeback: Meanwhile, Amanda confirmed that COVID-19 won't put a stop to Britain's Got Talent's return in 2021 - which will be the show's 15th season</p>

<p>She added: 'I also turn 50 next year, so I’m expecting a joint birthday! In fact, as a present I think I should be able to press all the golden buzzers!' (pictured on BGT) </p>
