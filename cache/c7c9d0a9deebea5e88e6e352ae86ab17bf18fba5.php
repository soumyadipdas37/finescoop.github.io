<p>The film also sparked a 10-episode series spinoff Love, Victor, which premiered in June on Hulu, following the journey another closeted kid at Simon's alma mater.</p>

<p>Albertalli opened up about the criticism she faced for writing and profiting off queer stories as someone who seemingly didn't belong to the LGBTQIA community. </p>

<p>She wrote: 'I was frequently mentioned by name, held up again and again as the quintessential example of allocishet inauthenticity.</p>

<p>'I was a straight woman writing sh***y queer books for the straights, profiting off of communities I had no connection to.'</p>

<p>Page turner: She ultimately came to terms with her sexuality after writing her book Leah on the Offbeat, the Simon sequel about his friend Leah, as she discover's she's bisexual</p>

<p>She continued: 'Let me be perfectly clear: this isn’t how I wanted to come out. This doesn’t feel good or empowering, or even particularly safe. </p>

<p>'Honestly, I’m doing this because I’ve been scrutinized, subtweeted, mocked, lectured, and invalidated just about every single day for years, and I’m exhausted. </p>

<p>'And if you think I’m the only closeted or semi-closeted queer author feeling this pressure, you haven’t been paying attention.'</p>

<p>Albertalli also revealed that she never met a bi person until college: 'And even then, my understanding of bisexuality as a concept didn’t entirely track with how I see it now. </p>

<p>'For one thing, the idea of sexual fluidity wasn’t even on my radar. And there didn’t seem to be a word for girls who basically liked guys, but were sometimes (randomly!) fascinated by girls.'</p>

<p>But she ultimately came to terms with her sexuality after writing her book Leah on the Offbeat, the Simon sequel about his friend Leah, as she discover's she's bisexual.</p>

<p>The NYT bestselling author added: 'It was my first time writing a love story between two girls — actually, it was my first time writing from the perspective of a character who’s attracted to girls. I worried I wouldn’t be able to feel what I’d need to feel in order to write a convincing love story.</p>

<p>'Turns out, that wasn’t a problem — and maybe that should have been my lightbulb moment. But denial comes with its own kind of logic. I was just immersed in Leah’s perspective, I decided.'    </p>

<p>She concluded: 'Anyway, all of this is to say: I’m bi. Sorry it took me so long to get here. But then again, at least the little red coming out book I needed was already on my shelf (in about thirty different languages). I think I finally know why I wrote it.'</p>

<p>Albertalli has written seven YA books, including four in the Simon universe, and she's married to Brian Albertalli, with whom she shares two children.</p>
