<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wife of ex-Minister Hugo Swire has been accused by furious Tory activists in his former constituency of 'betraying' friends with her indiscretion-heavy memoir.</p>

<p>Sasha Swire's tell-all book – Diary Of An MP's Wife: Inside And Outside Power – lifts the lid on sex and political shenanigans in the party, describing David Cameron as 'drunken Dave' with a filthy mouth, Boris Johnson as 'calculating' and Theresa May as a 'glumbucket'.</p>

<p>Lady Swire, 57, sent her diaries to a publisher last year after her husband retired as East Devon MP.</p>

<p>Last night Maddy Chapman, a Conservative district councillor there for 12 years, said local party members were 'absolutely disgusted' at the way she had breached the confidence of friends.</p>

<p>Sasha Swire, pictured with husband Hugo, has been accused by furious Tory activists in his former constituency of 'betraying' friends with her indiscretion-heavy memoir</p>

<p>'She has shown herself for what she is,' said Mrs Chapman. 'She has absolutely no class whatsoever.</p>

<p>'This has not gone down at all well in the constituency. Everyone I speak to is less than impressed and some, including myself, are absolutely disgusted.</p>

<p>'Sasha Swire has never mixed within the local community, not even within our local party.</p>

<p>'I suspect a lot of people will be crossing the Swires off their Christmas card list.'</p>

<p>In Lady Swire's tell-all memoir, she reveals how David and Samantha Cameron drowned their sorrows following the Brexit vote.</p>

<p>She tells how, in the wake of the 2016 referendum, she visited the Camerons for a weekend at their Oxfordshire home. She claims that the then-Prime Minister asked her husband to bring 'two fat Cohibas [Cuban cigars] and plenty of booze' and was 'chomping on cigars' over 'endless bottles of wine'.</p>

<p>And she adds that Mrs Cameron had to muster up some Dutch courage before joining her husband for his resignation speech, feeling unable to do so 'without drinking a large negroni'.</p>

<p>She also says that Mr Cameron told her former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi had a two-way mirror in his bedroom.</p>

<p>'I sit next to Dave at dinner,' she writes. 'He gives us wonderful vignettes of the Sarkozys' fake marital displays and of being given a tour around Rome's equivalent of No 10 by Berlusconi.</p>

<p>'When they come to his bedroom he points at a Renaissance two-way mirror above the bed and with his characteristic grin says, 'Well, they didn't have porn channels in those days, did they?' '</p>

<p>Of Boris Johnson, she is withering, writing: 'It scares the s*** out of me that people don't see [Mr Johnson] as the calculating machine he really is,' and she describes Mr Johnson's fiancee Carrie Symonds as his 'hot young vixen'.</p>

<p>She has nicknames for many senior Tories. Former Prime Minister Theresa May is 'Old Ma May', George Osborne is 'Boy George' while Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is 'Raab C Brexit'.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron has admitted the diaries, due out next week, were 'kind of embarrassing'.</p>
