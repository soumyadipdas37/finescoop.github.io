<p>REVEALED: The truth about a rumour that The Bachelor's Juliette Herrera (pictured) 'left her dirty underwear' hanging above a co-star's bed has been revealed</p>

<p>Laura indicated that there may be some truth to the rumours, but explained that it may have been exaggerated. </p>

<p>'I did hear about the dirty undies but I think it was definitely taken out of context,'she said.</p>

<p>'We had queues for the washing machine so we all had our own bags and stuff so I think it was probably taken out of context.'</p>

<p>'I don't think that's true,' Areeba Emmanuel stated on Thursday, before adding: 'I don't know anything about it and I don't believe it's true'</p>

<p>The rumours originated on the So Dramatic podcast last week.</p>

<p>In an episode of the show, host Megan Pustetto claimed that Juliette had caused friction in the mansion by hanging her 'dirty underwear' over Rosemary's bed for a week.</p>

<p>Rosemary recently denied claims that she asked producers to leave The Bachelor mansion because Juliette was 'making her feel uncomfortable'.</p>

<p>'I did hear about the dirty undies but I think it was definitely taken out of context,' Laura Calleri told The Kyle and Jackie O Show</p>

<p>The 23-year-old has revealed she was 'heavily invested in her relationship' with Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert, and was sent home because she didn't receive a rose.</p>

<p>'No, I wasn't asking to leave the mansion. I was heavily invested and got those feels for Locky,' she said in a statement to Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'I was like "I've done a cool rap, this will take me to next week, he's the love of my life, every chat we have is really good",' she continued.</p>

<p>Rumours: In an episode of the So Dramatic podcast, it was claimed that Juliette had caused friction by hanging her 'dirty underwear' over Rosemary Sawtell's (pictured) bed for a week</p>

<p>She added: 'I guess now, looking back at the situation, maybe he knew he didn't have feelings for me and did me a kind service by not leading me on anymore.</p>

<p>'He knew that I'd never had a boyfriend or had much dating experience so I think he actually did a kind thing by letting me go at that point.'</p>

<p>Her statement comes after The Wash claimed Rosemary had a meltdown and told producers she wanted to leave the show before the rose ceremony was filmed.</p>

<p>Denied: Rosemary recently denied claims that she asked producers to leave The Bachelor mansion because Juliette was 'making her feel uncomfortable'</p>
