<p>Oscar Diez Rodellino, 18, from Cervera, Spain, had been diving on the Balearic island of Ibiza when he decided to send a bubble ring through the warm waters.</p>

<p>Mr Rodellino, who swims for Club Natació Cervera in Spain, watched in awe as the jellyfish collided with the pocket of air and was sent spinning uncontrollably. </p>

<p>Oscar Diez Rodellino, 18, from Cervera, Spain, watches in awe as a jellyfish collides with the bubble ring</p>

<p>The sea creature is sent swirling after swimming into the spinning underwater vortex</p>

<p>Bubble rings are a form of vortex that are formed when trapped air from the seabed, or more usually a diver's breath, is released in a ring shape at a depth of at least 1.5 metres. </p>

<p>The silver doughnut of swirling fluid is created when water pressure at the bottom of the bubble is greater than at the top.</p>

<p>The difference in pressures squeezes the bubble and forms a hole in the middle. </p>

<p>Water circles back down and around the air which creates the ring shape.</p>

<p>As the water passes through, the ring begins to circulate and forms a vortex in the water.  </p>

<p>During the clip, Mr Rodellino rises from the seabed and watches as the jellyfish swims into his bubble ring.</p>

<p>The sea creature is unable to escape from the underwater vortex and continues spinning before eventually breaking free.</p>

<p>Mr Rodellion said: 'It was really awesome. It was something incredible to see live.'</p>

<p>Bubble rings are a form of vortex that occur in water when trapped air from the seabed, or more usually a diver's breath, is released in a ring shape.</p>

<p>The swirling fluid travels through the water by spinning in the same way a smoke ring does.</p>

<p>In order for the bubble to occur, the water pressure at the bottom of the ring must be greater than that at the top - this squeezes the bubble until the bottom meets the top and creates a hole through the middle. </p>

<p>The water then circles back down and around the ring and creates a vortex underwater.  </p>

<p>As the ring rises with speed, smaller creatures like jellyfish can be sucked into the vortex and spin.</p>

<p>Jellyfish are also susceptible to being spun around in strong waves and currents, although it is believed the animals have strong navigation capabilities and a good sense of direction.</p>

<p>The jellyfish continues to spin after being sucked into the swirling vortex in the water</p>

<p>The creature eventually manages to break free from the pocket of air and continues to spin</p>
