<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>John Terry has admitted that the controversial guard of honour during his final Chelsea match was one of the best moments of his career. </p>

<p>The ex-Blues captain was substituted after just 26 minutes - the same figure as his squad number - during the final match of the 2016-17 Premier League season against Sunderland and his team-mates clapped him off the pitch in two lines. </p>

<p>Chelsea had already won the title by that point and had a FA Cup final against Arsenal a week later, but Terry's moment of glory received a mixed reception despite the good-feeling in the air.  </p>

<p>John Terry claimed his guard of honour in his last Chelsea game was a career highlight </p>

<p>Speaking to Kevin Pietersen on the Unacademy platform, Terry  said: 'It's one of the favourite moments of my career. I remember other players like Lamps didn't get the send-off they deserved so I was happy to go out how I wanted.</p>

<p>'(Antonio) Conte told me I could play the match but we came to an agreement that I would play for 26 minutes and that would allow Cahill to keep his rhythm ahead of the final the next weekend.' </p>

<p>Despite lifting the Premier League title at the end of the campaign, Terry played just nine times under then-head coach Conte that season, with defenders Cesar Azpilicueta, David Luiz and vice-captain Gary Cahill preferred to the ex-England skipper. </p>

<p>Terry waved goodbye to life at Stamford Bridge after the Blues won the 2016-17 top-flight title</p>

<p>Despite the lack of performances, Terry claimed he would not have wanted to end his Stamford Bridge career in any other way. </p>

<p>He added: 'I didn't play much that season because Antonio Conte came in and we were playing three at the back. </p>

<p>'I was coming to the end but we won the league which was fantastic for me. I wanted a proper send-off and Conte and Gary Cahill were excellent with me.'</p>

<p>While the Blues won 5-1 against Sunderland that day, Chelsea went on to lose the FA Cup final on the following weekend to Arsenal, with Terry was an unused substitute at Wembley that day. </p>

<p>The defender then left to join Aston Villa in the Championship, but suffered another Wembley heartbreak as his new side lost the play-off final to Fulham in May 2018. </p>

<p>That game was his last in professional football, with the ex-England man now the assistant coach to Dean Smith at Villa Park. </p>
