<p>Liverpool fan Khan joked that it was tough to be complimentary of a United player but praised the work Rashford has done.</p>

<p>In the letter, Khan wrote: 'As a child, I benefited from free school meals. Life would have been much harder for my family if we didn't have them and I know how important they are.</p>

<p>'Your campaign, as well as the tireless efforts of charities and campaigners, many of whom we work with here in London, meant hundreds of thousands of children received the vital support they desperately needed over the summer holiday.</p>

<p>'But our fight to end child poverty doesn't stop here. Every child should have the right to healthy, affordable and sustainable food no matter what their circumstances or where they live. </p>
