<p>The younger brother of Inter Milan's former Manchester United, Chelsea and Everton striker Romelu, is weighing up a move to England as his club Lazio are willing to sell the left-back for around £5million.</p>

<p>With a number of Premier League sides looking to strengthen in that area, Lukaku's name has been discussed around the division with Lazio even willing to consider a loan deal for the Belgium international.</p>

<p>Lazio left back Jordan Lukaku (right) is targeting a move to the Premier League this summer</p>

<p>The 26-year-old saw a move to Newcastle United fall through in January last year and a knee injury put his Lazio career on hold.</p>

<p>However, he battled back to fitness and used the lockdown period to strengthen his knee further. </p>

<p>Coach Simone Inzaghi used him in 11 of Lazio's last 12 fixtures as they mounted a serious challenge for the Serie A title and he has since been a regular in their pre-season build-up to underline his return to fitness.</p>

<p>An attacking full-back, Lukaku, who idolised USA sprinter Maurice Greene as a boy before football became his main focus, is aiming to make Belgium's squad for the European Championships. </p>

<p>Though he faces strong competition to make the squad, he believes a move to England could help give him the best platform to stake his claim.</p>
