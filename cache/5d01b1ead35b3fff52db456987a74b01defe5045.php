<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Travellers returning from Thailand and Singapore will no longer have to quarantine after they were added to the UK safe travel list tonight.</p>

<p>But Britons and holidaymakers arriving in Britain from Slovenia and the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe will face 14 days in isolation from 4am on Saturday. </p>

<p>The Department of Transport announced the changes tonight. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman said: 'People arriving in England from Slovenia and Guadeloupe from 4am Saturday September 19 will need to self-isolate for two weeks as the countries are removed from the travel exemptions list.</p>

<p>Data from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and Public Health England has indicated a significant change in both the level and pace of confirmed cases of coronavirus in both destinations, leading to Ministers removing these from the current list of Travel Corridors.</p>

<p>'Data from Slovenia shows that the weekly incidence (cases) per 100,000 has increased from 14.4 on September 9 to 29.1 on September 16. This equates to a 102 per cent increase. </p>

<p>'There has been a sharp increase in the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Guadeloupe over the past 4 weeks, with a 558 per cent increase in weekly incidence per 100,000 between August 25 and September 15.'</p>
