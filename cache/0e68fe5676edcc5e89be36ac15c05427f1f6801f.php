<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A father who left his son brain damaged after shaking him when he wouldn't stop crying failed to tell doctors what happened for two weeks.</p>

<p>The father-of-three, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, shook his six-month-old son twice on March 15 last year, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Southport District Court heard the infant's mother came home from work on the day of the incident to find the child floppy, lethargic and vomiting.</p>

<p>Hospital staff were unable to find anything wrong with the boy, even after puncturing his lumbar to rule out meningitis.</p>

<p>His mother took him back to hospital multiple times over the next two weeks because the youngster was 'off'.</p>

<p>An MRI taken on March 30 revealed that the boy's brain had been bleeding. </p>

<p>The father denied any wrongdoing during police interviews on April 8 and 9, but his partner continued to question him that night.</p>

<p>'He admitted to shaking the child twice after the child would not stop crying,' Crown prosecutor Michael Mitchell told the court.</p>

<p>'It is not suggested the offending was anything other than an act of frustration due to the child's crying.' </p>

<p>Police spoke to the father again and he admitted to shaking the child for about two seconds.</p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to assault occasioning bodily harm and was sentenced to two years in jail with immediate release on parole.</p>

<p>Defence barrister John McInnes said he was sorry for his actions, but added the man had been a drunk who was known to be violent.  </p>

<p>Judge Catherine Muir said the offence was 'serious violent offending committed by you against a vulnerable child'.</p>

<p>'A child who needs your protection not for your to lose control and shake him for crying.' </p>

<p>She accepted it was a one-off incident.</p>

<p>The couple have separated and the boy is in the care of his mother, who supervises their visits.</p>

<p>He allowed overnight visits with his older two children. </p>

<p>The man moved to Australia at the age of 18 and could face deportation. </p>
