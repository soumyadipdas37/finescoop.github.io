<p>Dana provided vital care to hundreds of animals harmed during the fires and spoke about how the Island's wildlife was affected, including the devastating impact on its koala population, and the work that is being done to reintroduce rescued animals back into the wild and restore their natural habitats. </p>

<p>Approximately 48 per cent of Kangaroo Island was affected by bushfires over the course of several weeks, leading to the loss of two lives and significant damage to residents' homes and livelihoods. </p>

<p>During the call, The Duke of Cambridge said: 'It's fantastic to hear about the community spirit in Australia as always, which is what Catherine and I see when we come down there.

<p>Captain Mike Swayne, who spent five weeks fighting the fires as a volunteer for the South Australian Country Fire Service, outlined during the call the difficulties faced by first responders on the ground, including the weather conditions and the speed at which the fires spread. </p>

<p>Prince William and Kate also heard about the work of a taskforce set up by the Australian Defence Force as part of the national response, providing support to local emergency services and affected communities in South Australia. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess praised the efforts of all those who had worked to tackle the spread of the fire and protect the island's residents in the most challenging of circumstances.</p>
