<p>Worried: Coronation Street and Emmerdale bosses are reportedly concerned their soaps will look dated compared to BBC rival EastEnders</p>

<p>The news comes amid claims Coronation Street and Emmerdale bosses are reportedly concerned their soaps will look dated compared to BBC rival EastEnders.</p>

<p>Sources have claimed producers are worried their new coronavirus-friendly filming methods do not hold up to their BBC rivals, who are using clever new techniques with the help of perspex screens, CGI and stand-ins.</p>

<p>So far Corrie and Emmerdale have used clever editing and filming angles to hide the use to social distancing during production, but have been forced to eliminate kissing and other intimate scenes.</p>

<p>Drama: Sources claimed producers are worried their coronavirus-friendly methods do not hold up to their BBC rivals, who are using techniques including perspex screens, CGI and stand-ins</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Everyone backstage is miffed because they think both Corrie and Emmerdale are going to look really dated now Enders is back.  </p>

<p>'So whereas Corrie and Enders bosses ruled out perspex screens early on — so there's no kissing or sex scenes and everyone is clearly two metres apart — they are now looking at copying the idea so they don't look low-rent compared to Enders. </p>

<p>'But ­obviously it's going to take a while before fans see the ­difference on screen, as they have already filmed so much.</p>

<p>The insider added that some crew members suggested the use of perspex screens during filming, but their ideas were 'pushed back.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Coronation Street and Emmerdale for comment at the time of publication.</p>

<p>Coronation Street and Emmerdale were the first soaps to resume filming following the COVID-19 crisis, and have introduced one-way systems and strict social distancing rules during filming.</p>

<p>Both shows were able to avoid going off-air during the pandemic, though did reduce their weekly episodes to just six per week. They will return to their usual schedules on Monday, September 14th. </p>

<p>Revolutionary: EastEnders finally returned to screens on Monday after a three-month break, and have introduced an array of new methods</p>

<p>Meanwhile EastEnders finally returned to screens on Monday after a three-month break, and have introduced an array of new methods to try and hide the use of social distancing.</p>

<p>Among them are the use of perspex screens between characters, which will also be used in kiss scenes before being edited out, along with CGI to create the illusion of two characters being in the same room.</p>

<p>Executive producer Jon Sen also told MailOnline that in some cases cast members' real-life partners are being used as stand-ins for intimate scenes. </p>
