<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry today praised Diversity's 'amazing' Black Lives Matter-inspired dance routine on Britain's Got Talent as he called for an end to 'structural racism' in Britain.</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging interview from the Sussexes' £11million California mansion, Prince Harry said he was 'surprised' by the thousands of complaints made to Ofcom after the controversial performance.</p>

<p>The Duke of Sussex also revealed his 'awakening' to issues faced by black people after meeting his wife Meghan Markle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Meghan called Black Lives Matter protests in the US after the death of George Floyd 'beautiful' — but claimed this only applied to 'peaceful protest' and admitted that many people found the demonstrations 'inflammatory'.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Evening Standard, Harry revealed he spoke to Diversity's leader Ashley Banjo after the troupe's routine sparked a massive backlash.</p>

<p>He said: 'We spoke to Ashley Banjo a few weeks ago, straight after the Britain's Got Talent situation. And that in itself, I am sure even me talking about it will be controversial, but the reality of it is he and his team of guys put on the most amazing display.</p>

<p>Prince Harry today praised Diversity's 'amazing' Black Lives Matter-inspired dance routine on Britain's Got Talent as he called for an end to 'structural racism' in Britain </p>

<p>In a wide-ranging interview from the Sussexes' £11million California mansion, Prince Harry said he was 'surprised' by the thousands of complaints made to Ofcom after the performance </p>

<p>'We had such a good chat with Ashley. He was really strong, he felt great about it, but at the same time he was concerned because of the reaction. It was a real surprise that there was what?</p>

<p>'1,100 complaints after the show and then three days of hype it became 20 or 25,000. I am very glad Ofcom made the decision that they did but that in itself kind of proves how much this conversation needs to continue.'</p>

<p>Diversity's BLM-inspired routine garnered nearly 25,000 complaints to broadcast regulator Ofcom as the performance became the second-most complained about television moment of the decade.</p>

<p>Ofcom will not investigate Diversity's controversial Black Lives Matter-inspired routine from Britain's Got Talent on September 5, despite viewer complaints soaring to 24,500.</p>

<p>The performance has now become the second-most complained about television moment of the decade, but a spokesperson for the government-approved regulatory body has confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken.  </p>

<p>The representative said: 'We carefully considered a large number of complaints about this artistic routine, an area where freedom of expression is particularly important. </p>

<p>'Diversity's performance referred to challenging and potentially controversial subjects, and in our view, its central message was a call for social cohesion and unity. </p>

<p>'Any depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation – but rather a message that the lives of black people matter.' </p>

<p>Troupe leader Ashley Banjo reacted to the news on Instagram as he shared the statement and penned: 'Creativity is always a leap of faith. All I did what was what felt right and I’d do it 100 times over... Sending love to everyone that stood by us'. </p>

<p>The decision was met with a mixed reaction from viewers, with some lauding the move and others claiming firmer action needed to be taken.  </p>

<p>However, a spokesman for the Government-approved body revealed that it will not take action against Diversity as it argued that the troupe's performance 'referred to challenging and potentially controversial subjects, and in our view, its central message was a call for social cohesion and unity'.</p>

<p>In an article written to coincide with the interview, the couple said: 'For as long as structural racism exists, there will be generations of young people of colour who do not start their lives with the same equality of opportunity as their white peers.</p>

<p>'And for as long as that continues, untapped potential will never get to be realised.'</p>

<p>The interview is the latest in a long series of political interventions by the couple, including last week when Harry weighed in on the US election by urging voters to 'reject hate speech'.</p>

<p>The comments — which broke royal protocol — were widely interpreted as a call to vote out Donald Trump, and prompted Buckingham Palace to immediately distance themselves from Harry by noting he was 'not working member of the Royal Family'.</p>

<p>Harry, 36, said he had become more aware of the issue of racism after marrying his wife, 39. </p>

<p>He said: 'Because I wasn't aware of so many of the issues and so many of the problems within the UK and also globally as well. I thought I did but I didn't.'</p>

<p>He added: 'You know, when you go in to a shop with your children and you only see white dolls, do you even think: 'That's weird, there is not a black doll there?'.'</p>

<p>The interview also saw the Duchess of Sussex comment on the sometimes violent Black Lives Matter protests in the US after the death of George Floyd. </p>

<p>She admitted the demonstrations could be 'inflammatory' but that - when peaceful - they were a 'beautiful thing'.   </p>

<p>Last week, the Duke and Duchess were accused of 'over-stepping the line' after a thinly-veiled swipe at Donald Trump as they urged Americans to get out and vote in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>In the couple's most high-profile intervention in the US presidential election, Harry urged voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' – all qualities critics associate with Mr Trump.</p>

<p>In a TV appearance to mark Time magazine's 100 most influential people roll call, Meghan – who has made no secret of her antipathy towards the president – described November's vote as the most important election of her lifetime.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harry complained that he had never been able to exercise his democratic right to vote because of the convention that, as a member of the British Royal Family, he should remain politically neutral. </p>

<p>Royal insiders voiced concern in Britain where the Queen and her family are expected to remain politically neutral at all times, with one saying that Harry and Meghan had 'crossed a line'. </p>

<p>Buckingham Palace also distanced itself from Harry's remarks by saying that 'the Duke is not a working member of the royal family' and describing his comments as 'made in a personal capacity'.   </p>

<p>Speaking in a Zoom interview with the Evening Standard from their new £11million home in Santa Barbara, California, the couple said they were 'doing well' after leaving the UK</p>
