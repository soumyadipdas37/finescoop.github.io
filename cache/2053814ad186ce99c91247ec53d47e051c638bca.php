<p>Perfect shape: Jessica Simpson's figure looks better than ever after losing 100lbs in 2019 after welcoming her third child. And on Thursday the former pop singer showed off her toned shape as she sat in a chair with a sleeveless white leotard on</p>

<p>'Tune in to <?php echo e('@'); ?>HSN tonight while my business boss/mom, <?php echo e('@'); ?>TinaSimpsonOfficial, and I go live from our <?php echo e('@'); ?>JessicaSimpsonStyle LA Showroom at 7-9pm EST/ 4-6pm PST,' she stated.</p>

<p>'We will be sharing some of our favorite new Fall styles including the first pair of flat boots that I have fallen in love with since high school.'</p>

<p>The star was on a small green velvet chair inside her walk-in closet.</p>

<p>Her blonde hair was worn down with a black hat on top as she had on a white top while looking to the side.</p>

<p>Her look is loved: She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales. Last week she showed off these Daisy Duke shorts with a crop top and heels</p>

<p>She can sure work a look well: And she was layered in gold jewelry as she posed by a van</p>

<p>A Brigitte Bardot appeal: Her hair was long and nearly white as she posed in the van</p>

<p>The focus of the shot was her lean legs that were also freshly tanned.</p>

<p>The Public Affair hitmaker was showing off her new shoes, which she said were the first flat boots she has loved since high school.</p>

<p>The boots had a lot going on as they seemed to have plaid material with several buckles.</p>

<p>She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales.</p>

<p>The star had on one of her tops as she was hugged by her husband Eric Johnson to celebrate his 41st birthday.</p>

<p>The successful designer who makes clothes, purses, sunglasses and shoes, among other things, had on skintight jeans and a hoodie.</p>

<p>'Oh how I love you!!! When I was in my mommy’s belly God formed me and placed you in my heart,' Jessica began her caption.</p>

<p>Look by Jess: She has been dutifully showing off her designs all month as she ramps up for fall sales. The star had on one of her tops as she was hugged by her husband Eric Johnson to celebrate his 41st birthday </p>

<p>Style statement: The successful designer who makes clothes, purses, sunglasses and shoes, among other things, had on skintight jeans and a hoodie</p>

<p>The 40-year-old took up with Eric in 2010 and married him in 2014, welcoming three children with him - Maxwell, eight, Ace, seven, and Birdie, one.</p>

<p>'It took me 29yrs to discover my soulmate and colliding with your heart was our spiritual destiny,' she wrote of the former NFL star.</p>

<p>'You are the human that all should aspire to be. A force of transformative inspiration to all that know and love you and are lucky enough to have you love them back.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I am so excited to see all that you have been working on so beautifully to be introduced into the world this year!'</p>

<p>Another bohemian beach look: In this set up she had on a striped suit with platform heels as she posed with her daughter Maxwell</p>

<p>Her second daughter: On the star's hip was her latest edition, daughter Birdie Mae</p>

<p>Jessica soldiered ahead with a plug for her husband's new brand Legendary Disciplines, which made the hoodie she was wearing in the Instagram picture.</p>

<p>Eric joined Instagram just to start an account for the brand and Jessica swung by Insta Stories to welcome 'the most social guy I know' to the platform. </p>

<p>'Everyone get ready to be enlightened by my legendary spiritual guru... <?php echo e('@'); ?>legendarydisciplines,' she wrote. 'Thank God ERIC JOHNSON was born this day 41yrs ago! Happy Birthday hubba hubba hubby of mine!!!'</p>

<p>Before Jessica married Eric, whose football position was tight end, she spent 2002 until 2006 married to her fellow singer Nick Lachey.</p>

<p>Nick has gone on to marry Vanessa Minnillo, whom he was infamously pap-snapped getting intimate with in a hot tub in Mexico while they were dating.</p>

<p>Jessica's younger sister and fellow pop act Ashlee Simpson is currently expecting her own third child, her second by her current husband Evan Ross.</p>

<p>Like his wife Evan comes from a showbiz family - his mother is legendary singer Diana Ross and his sister is actress Tracee Ellis Ross.</p>
