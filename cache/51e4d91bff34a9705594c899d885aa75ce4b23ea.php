<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It seems The View co-host Joy Behar missed the part of Netflix's docuseries Tiger King where it's claimed Carole Baskin may have murdered her former husband Don Lewis.</p>

<p>On Tuesday's episode of the ABC daytime show, Behar suggested that the network could have enjoyed a major coup by having Baskin's ex make a surprise appearance on Dancing With The Stars, on which she's a contestant.</p>

<p>Baskin, 59, the founder of Florida's Big Cat Rescue, gained national celebrity following the release of streaming hit Tiger King in which it's alleged she may have fed Lewis' body to tigers. </p>

<p>Joy Behar on Tuesday's episode of The voice suggested ABC could have struck ratings gold by having Tiger King star Carole Baskin's ex-husband make a surprise appearance on DWTS</p>

<p>Murky: It seems Behar missed the part in the hit Netflix docuseries where it's alleged Baskin was involved in Lewis' disappearance in 1997 and may have fed his body to tigers</p>

<p>While admitting she has 'no idea' what Tiger King is about, Behar shared, according to UsWeekly: 'What they told me this morning is that she's under suspicion and the husband is missing, so what would have been a really big coup for ABC was to have the husband on Dancing With the Stars.' </p>

<p>'Now that would have been good television. Bring him back!' the 77-year-old veteran TV personality added.</p>

<p>Her co-host Whoopi Goldberg then chimed in, pointing out an obvious flaw in Behar's thinking.</p>

<p>'He's no longer on the planet, Joy. He's no longer with us,' Goldberg, 64, told her.</p>

<p>Ahem: Behar's co-host Whoopi Goldberg pointed out an obvious flaw in Behar's thinking. 'He's no longer on the planet, Joy. He's no longer with us,' Goldberg told her</p>

<p>Milking the theme: Baskin, 59, made her debut on DWTS on Monday night, dancing a Paso Doble to 80s track Eye Of The Tiger with pro partner Pasha Pashkov</p>

<p>The discussion on The View was sparked by the decision by Lewis' family to run a commercial in Florida during Monday night's episode of DWTS in which they appealed for information regarding their loved one's disappearance in 1997. </p>

<p>Lewis was declared dead in 2002. </p>

<p>Baskin has denied having any involvement even though she was accused of murder by her big cat rival Joe Exotic. </p>

<p>Instead, she branded the Lewis family's TV ad as a 'huge publicity stunt' while appearing on Entertainment Tonight with partner Pasha Pashkov following the DWTS premiere. </p>

<p>Still seeking answers: Lewis' family is offering a $100,000 reward for information about his disappearance and ran a TV commercial in Florida during Monday's dancing With The Stars</p>

<p>Big cat drama: Lewis was legally declared dead in 2002 and in Tiger King, Baskin's rival Joe Exotic claimed she had been involved in his disappearance. Joe is serving a 22-year sentence for a murder-for-hire plot targeting Baskin</p>

<p>Lewis' daughters are offering a $100,000 reward for information about his disappearance a day before he was due to leave on a trip to Costa Rica in 1997. </p>

<p>In Tiger King, Joe Exotic, who is serving a 22-year sentence for a murder-for-hire plot targeting Baskin, claimed she may have fed Lewis' body to tigers. </p>

<p>For her high-profile turn on Dancing With The Stars, Baskin is paired with dance pro Pasha Pashkov but the pair didn't fare too well in the season premiere Monday.</p>

<p>They scored just 11 out of a possible 30 points for their Paso Doble danced to 80s track Eye of the Tiger. </p>

<p>Next week Dancing With The Stars will air its first elimination. In lieu of its regular Monday slot, the show will air Tuesday at 8 p.m. on ABC.  </p>

<p>Shrugged it off: : On Tuesday, Baskin was seen arriving for rehearsals at a studio in LA after dismissing the Lewis family as a 'huge publicity stunt</p>
