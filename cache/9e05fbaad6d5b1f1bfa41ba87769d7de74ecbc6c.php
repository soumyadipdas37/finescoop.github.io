<p>For the 3'10' contestant, the adulation was especially rewarding, because he'd struggled for so long.</p>

<p>'My entire life I felt rejected by society because of my size,' Alan said in a pre-taped video, adding that the love of his wife and children had helped him imagine a better future.</p>

<p>Alan's wife, Bethany Silva, showed up to surprise him before his performance, and watched backstage as he aced his death-defying act, with Ruelle's Live Like Legends playing.</p>

<p>The judges: Heidi, Howie and new judge Sofia Vergara evaluated the 10 finalists</p>

<p>'People really underestimated you,' Heidi told Alan afterward. 'People bullied you because of your size. And I really do hope that all of these people are watching right now.'</p>

<p>'It gets better and better, Alan,' added new judge Sofia Vergara, 48. 'This was so artistic, the water, the fire, you looked so amazing up there. And down here, too, you look great.'</p>

<p>Howie pointed out that the act seemed like 'the most dangerous one' Alan had done yet, as the acrobat had had to 'hold on for dear life,' while he was soaking wet.</p>

<p>Alan agreed and said, 'I just want to empower people and help people realize that they were born for greatness, no matter how they look, no matter what they go through.'</p>
