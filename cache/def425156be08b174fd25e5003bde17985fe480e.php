<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If John Cleese had his way Eddie Byrom might not even have been playing in the Bob Willis Trophy final, let alone propelling Somerset towards a position where they can dream about winning their ever-elusive maiden first-class title.</p>

<p>Lifelong Somerset fan Cleese reacted with fury on Twitter last week when he discovered Tom Banton was putting the Indian Premier League before what he described as ‘the biggest match’ in his beloved county’s history.</p>

<p>But if Kolkata’s Banton, or the injured James Hildreth, had been available to face Essex in this inaugural first-class cup final Byrom might have been carrying drinks rather than playing the innings of his life here yesterday.</p>

<p>Eddie Byrom made a classy century to put Somerset firmly in the driving seat at Lords</p>

<p>Nothing the 23-year-old Zimbabwean had previously done, at least in red-ball cricket, hinted at his domination of the Essex attack and the sheer quality of his 117 on another rain-affected day in this autumnal showpiece final.</p>

<p>Certainly not a first-class record that has seen his only other two centuries come against the might of Cardiff MCC University and the Bulawayo Metropolitan Tuskers.</p>

<p>And not a record that saw him average just 17 in this competition ahead of the final and remain without a championship half century since June 2018.</p>

<p>Sam Cook led the Essex fightback with a five-wicket haul after the introduction of the new ball</p>

<p>But from the moment Byrom launched a counter-attack with Somerset in trouble on the first day the left-hander has looked a class act and went on to a brilliant century on Thursday before Essex gave themselves hope with a second new ball burst.</p>

<p>‘I’m very proud,’ said Byrom, whose only other visit to Lord’s was to watch Somerset win last year’s Royal London Cup as a spectator. ‘I’ve been struggling for form and to do this in a massive game at such a special place makes it all the more satisfying.’</p>

<p>Somerset finally reached an above par 301 all out which would have been worse for Essex had Sam Cook not taken five wickets with his lively medium pace, the perennial bridesmaids of the County Championship losing their last five to that new ball for 35.</p>

<p>Sir Alastair Cook and Nick Browne were saved from facing three overs by the close because of bad light even though the best floodlights in the country shone down brightly on Lord's, but Somerset, with Byrom adding 127 for the sixth wicket with Craig Overton, are in the box seat with three days left and a better forecast over the weekend for St John’s Wood.</p>

<p>Essex will need Alastair Cook to make big runs on Friday if they are to dash Somerset's hopes</p>

<p>Byrom, who qualifies for England next year and has turned down approaches to play for Zimbabwe, put down an early marker by hitting Essex’s biggest threat in Simon Harmer for two fours in his first over of day two and by the time he stroked Cook for a classic on-driven boundary to reach three figures Essex heads were beginning to drop.</p>

<p>Overton proved almost as difficult to budge even though Essex had two loud shouts for lbw against him turned down by Rob Bailey – replays suggested the umpire was spot on both times - and displayed his batting ability to watching selector James Taylor with 66.</p>

<p>It leaves Essex, with the trophy going to the side who make the biggest first innings score should the final end in a draw, needing Sir Alastair to make big runs on Friday if they are again going to dash Somerset’s hopes, as they did in last year's Championship decider.</p>
