<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A second earthquake in the space of a week has hit Leighton Buzzard, according to the British Geological Survey (BGS).</p>

<p>The tremor in Bedfordshire, which hit at 11.20pm on Sunday night, was measured by the BGS at magnitude 2.1.</p>

<p>It is thought to have been an aftershock from the magnitude 3.5 quake that was felt on September 8.</p>

<p>A BGS spokesman said: 'The most recent event was over 100 times smaller than the event on September 8 in the same area.</p>

<p>'The occurrence of smaller events from other previous UK earthquakes is not unknown.</p>

<p>The latest Leighton Buzzard quake is thought to have been an aftershock from the magnitude 3.5 quake that was felt on September 8</p>

<p>'The small event that occurred in Bedfordshire last night could have occurred because all the stress in the rocks was not relieved by the event on September 8 in the same area or it caused a slight change to the stress regime in that location.</p>

<p>'There is constant ongoing research in the academic world on the issue of aftershock occurrence.'</p>

<p>Responding to the quake, Rich Wilkinson-Iles tweeted: 'What is going on??? Just woken by another earth quake in Leighton Buzzard!' </p>

<p>A second person said: 'Pretty sure we just had ANOTHER earthquake here in Leighton Buzzard. What the hell is going on?'</p>

<p>While a third wrote: 'Was that another #earthquake in #LeightonBuzzard?'</p>

<p>It comes just six days after a 3.5 magnitude quake rocked the town. </p>

<p>During the September 8 quake, residents described strong shaking and rattling walls, though police said no injuries were reported.</p>

<p>After Sunday's quake, the BGS tweeted: 'One report describes 'It felt slower and less intense than the previous tremor'.'</p>

<p>Small earthquakes are not uncommon in the UK but are rarely felt in the Bedfordshire area.</p>

<p>Footage taken inside a home in Leighton Buzzard showed the moment the earthquake struck on September 8.</p>

<p>Witness Dean Gray shared the footage of his terrified dogs to Twitter with the caption: 'Actually thought my house was falling down.'  </p>

<p>Some 610,000 people live in the affected areas according to the European-Mediterranean Seismological Centre. </p>

<p>It was felt at around 8.45am and had an epicentre 6.2 miles deep. </p>
