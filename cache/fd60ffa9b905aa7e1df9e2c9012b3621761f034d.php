<p>The 25-year-old fled the paperwork in Los Angeles on Friday, according to TMZ, but no specifics were given as to why.</p>

<p>The two split in May 2020 after he gave her the final rose but did not propose on the reality TV show two years prior.</p>

<p>A bad turn: Cassie Randolph has reportedly filed for a restraining order against her ex boyfriend Colton Underwood whom she fell for on The Bachelor</p>

<p>Just before the split, 28-year-old Underwood had told fans he had suffered from COVID-19 but has since said he recovered.</p>

<p>The former football player has also been linked to Pretty Little Liars actress Lucy Hale after they were photographed together.</p>

<p>In late August Cassie and Colton unfollowed each other on Instagram. Her family also followed suit.  </p>

<p>While Randolph's older sister, Michelle Randolph, was unfollowed, Underwood still continues to follow Michelle’s boyfriend, Gregg Sulkin, who he reportedly spent time with just two weeks ago.  </p>

<p>Hard to take: The 25-year-old fled the paperwork in Los Angeles on Friday, according to TMZ, but no specifics were given as to why; here Colton is seen on The Bachelor crying</p>

<p>And before that Underwood accused The Bachelor franchise of manipulating and taking advantage of his ex-girlfriend Cassie following their breakup.  </p>

<p>Cassie was fresh out of her split with Colton when she appeared on The Bachelor: The Greatest Season Ever in July, where host Chris Harrison asked her multiple times about their relationship. </p>

<p>Though Cassie declined to divulge much information, Colton was upset to see how Chris and The Bachelor franchise focused solely for their split, it has been claimed.</p>

<p>Over for months: The two split in May 2020 after he gave her the final rose but did not propose on the reality TV show two years prior. Seen in April 2019</p>

<p>'Cass stayed extremely professional and extremely quiet about our breakup,' Colton said during an interview with Reality Steve. 'What bugged me was the fact that that show took advantage of her.'</p>

<p>After the interview, Colton posted a message on Instagram about how he had hoped their breakup would remain private, leading fans to believe he was angry at Cassie for even appearing on the show.</p>

<p>But it turns out Colton's frustrations were primarily directed at the series. </p>

<p>'I get very defensive over people I love and I know Cass is a big girl and she can fight her own battles, but I just know her heart and she doesn't want to rock the boat and she loves people, even if they abuse her or even if they take advantage of her, which they did.'</p>

<p>According to Colton, producers told Cassie they were bringing her on to 'get to know her' and talk about what was going on in her life.</p>

<p>The former lovebirds, who found love on Season 23, first sparked breakup rumors after he returned to his hometown in Colorado after recovering from coronavirus at her family's home in Huntington Beach, California.</p>

<p>'Its been a crazy few months to say the least, Cass and I have been doing a lot of self-reflecting. Sometimes people are just meant to be friends - and that’s okay,' the former NFL player captioned a black and white snap of them from behind.</p>

<p>He added: 'We both have grown immensely and been through so much together - so this isn’t the end of our story, it’s the start of a whole new chapter for us.' </p>

<p>The Randolph shared a series of snaps from their relationship with a number of shots with her arms wrapped around Underwood. </p>

<p>'First off, I want to say this is one of the hardest things I have had to share as neither one of us is quite ready to talk about it yet,' she began in her lengthy post.</p>

<p>She continued: 'Colton and I have broken up, but have decided to remain a part of each others lives. With all that we have gone through, we have a special bond that will always be there.' </p>

<p>On-again, off-again:  In March, the pair previously revealed they spilt after filming and it was a 'very real and very emotional breakup'</p>

<p>'I love Colton very much and have an enormous amount of respect for him. We have both learned and grown so much these past couple years, and will always have each others back. Always,' she concluded.</p>

<p>Their split appears to be amicable, as the speech pathology student commented two red heart emojis on her ex's post.</p>

<p>In March, the pair previously revealed they split after filming and it was a 'very real and very emotional breakup.'</p>

<p>'To put it very frank, after the show, we realized we weren't communicating as well as we once did,' he wrote in his memoir The First Time</p>

<p>'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said</p>

<p>Underwood revealed their first breakup and rekindling in his book The First Time.</p>

<p>'To put it very frank, after the show, we realized we weren't communicating as well as we once did,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'Nobody was forcing us to talk about real things going on, so we let a lot of things build up.' </p>

<p>In the end, 'in a weird way, I kind of broke up with myself,' he added.</p>

<p>The pair mutually decided to have some space to figure things out.</p>

<p>Signs of separation: The Bachelor couple, who found love on Season 23, first sparked breakup rumors after he returned to his hometown in Colorado after recovering from coronavirus at her family's home in Huntington Beach, California</p>

<p>'I was like, I feel like we need to figure this out and in order to do that, we need space. She agreed. So it was a mutual thing,' he elaborated.</p>

<p>The split didn't last long, though - just a few days later, though, the pair were already longing for one another. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Colton said he could see them getting engaged by the end of 2020.</p>

<p>'If she were here, she'd nudge me for saying this, but I think an engagement is something we'd both like to see this year,' he said. </p>

<p>So in love: Colton met Cassie on his season of The Bachelor last year, where he dramatically jumped over a fence after she dumped him on the Fantasy Suite date night </p>
