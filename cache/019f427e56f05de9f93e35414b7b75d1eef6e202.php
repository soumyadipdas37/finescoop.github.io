<p>Open: Melanie C, 46, has spoken of how she 'struggled' with an eating disorder and depression after the pressures of her Spice Girls fame 'pushed her to the point of illness' on Sunday (pictured 2019) </p>

<p>Speaking to The Observer, she said: 'The lows of being famous were devastatingly hard.' </p>

<p>She continued: 'It pushed me to the point of illness. I was struggling with an eating disorder and suffering from depression. </p>

<p>'I had everything I'd ever dreamed of, and was desperately unhappy. It's often forgotten that people in the public eye are human.' </p>

<p>Fame: Mel, who was 20 when she responded to an advert to form a girl group in 1994, told how she had 'everything' she had 'ever dreamed of' but was 'desperately unhappy' (pictured 1996 L-R Mel C, Victoria Beckham, Mel B, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell)</p>

<p>The 1996 Wannabe hitmaker, mother to 11-year-old Scarlet who she shares with her ex Thomas Starr, described how she was 'ashamed' to accept help and 'could see not way out'. </p>

<p>However the songstress revealed how 'when the time came' she sought professional help and has urged others to get to the point when they are 'ready' to receive help.  </p>

<p>Melanie said she was 'struggling to get out of bed' and was 'very teary' at the depths of her depression before she sought help in 2000 during a trip to LA with her family. </p>

<p>Honest: The singer, who was dubbed Sporty Spice because of her athletic style, combated her depression through a mixture of therapies, acupuncture and medication (pictured February 2020)</p>

<p>Speaking to The Mirror, she said: 'I didn't have the will any longer to stay in this life. </p>

<p>'That is when I decided to go and see my GP... the first thing he wanted to address was my depression.</p>

<p>'It was a massive relief to me. I just thought I was going mad, it had a name, it was something you could be helped with... recover from.' </p>

<p>'I'm proud': Addressing the lyrics on her new single, 'When I look in the mirror, I finally like what I see', the mother-of-one [L] noted she had come a long way in her journey of self-acceptance</p>

<p>Mel has revealed that the lead track on her new solo album, Who I Am, was inspired by her battle with an eating disorder, which developed at the peak of her fame.</p>

<p>She told  Stellar Magazine: 'I started exercising obsessively, I stopped eating properly, and I began to become very, very ill.' </p>

<p>Melanie explained that she grew up as a 'confident and ambitious' child - but that all changed when her image was constantly scrutinised as part of the Spice Girls.  </p>

<p>She revealed that it was around the millennium when she began feeling 'low' and struggled to get out of bed, despite her jam-packed schedule.</p>

<p>Melanie continued: 'I was really worried for my sanity. I was binge-eating, as well. I went to my doctor, and he said to me, 'The first thing you need to address is your depression', and I never thought for one second that I could be depressed.' </p>

<p>When she realised she was suffering from depression, that's when Melanie's 'road to recovery began'.</p>

<p>Family: The 1996 Wannabe hitmaker is mother to 11-year-old Scarlet who she shares with her ex Thomas Starr</p>

<p>Addressing the lyrics on her new single, 'When I look in the mirror, I finally like what I see', the mother-of-one noted she had come a long way in her journey of self-acceptance.</p>

<p>'I've come to realise that I shouldn't regret anything. I should be proud because I survived that and that's what compels me to share it with people,' she said.</p>

<p>However Melanie revealed how a Spice Girls reunion is 'something' all five, including her along with Victoria Beckham, Geri Halliwell and Mel B,  would 'want to do'. </p>

<p>She told how the five met a Geri's house following the easing of lockdown restrictions and said how the group are 'closer' than they have been in a long time. </p>

<p>Melanie described the girl band as a 'huge dysfunctional family' who share a 'bond' that is unbreakable. </p>
