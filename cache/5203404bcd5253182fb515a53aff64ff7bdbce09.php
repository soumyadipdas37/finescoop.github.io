<p>The decadent treats, which were posted anonymously in an Australian Facebook group on Tuesday, can be made with a handful of simple supermarket ingredients like cream, sugar and cornflour, an oven and a piping bag.</p>

<p>Their unique flavour has been hailed as 'very impressive' by a string of home cooks, with many branding the creation an 'awesome' fusion of their favourite desserts.</p>

<p>Crème brûlée macarons, inspired by the iconic French dessert made from vanilla custard and caramelised sugar</p>

<p>How to make the crème brûlée filling</p>

<p>The custard filling must be refrigerated for two to three hours, so it's best to make that first.</p>

<p>This can be done by heating a quarter cup of milk and a half cup of cream in a small saucepan right until boiling point, and beating three egg yolks, a quarter cup of sugar and a generous tablespoon of cornflour in a bowl while it warms.</p>

<p>Once fully heated, the cream mixture should be poured into the egg mixture in a thin, steady stream, whisking constantly to prevent curdling.</p>

<p>Then returned to the stovetop on a medium heat and warmed for three to five minutes, again stirring constantly.</p>

<p>Crème brûlée is a dessert that consists of a rich vanilla custard base topped with a hardened layer of caramelised sugar, typically served slightly chilled in individual ramekins.</p>

<p>The earliest known recipe appears in French chef Francois Massialot's cookbook 'Cuisinier royal et bourgeois', which was published in 1691. </p>

<p>The title 'burnt cream' was used in the English translation, but the dish then vanished from the French culinary scene until the 1980s when it became a 'symbol of the decade's self-indulgence and the darling of the restaurant boom'.</p>

<p>The rebirth of crème brûlée has been credited to New York chef Sirio Maccioni who served it at his midtown Manhattan eatery Le Cirque during that decade.</p>

<p>Once the liquid has thickened into a soft custard, it should be strained through a fine sieve and mixed with vanilla paste for flavour.</p>

<p>You can tell that the custard is ready when it coats the back of a spoon without dripping off.</p>

<p>Leave it to cool at room temperature before spooning it into a piping bag fitted with a plain round nozzle and refrigerating for at least two hours.</p>

<p>The sweet nougat shells (pictured) are topped with caramelised sugar to mimic the hard coating typically found on crème brûlée</p>

<p>How to make the macaron shells</p>

<p>With the filling complete, the shells should be started by sifting one cup of almond flour and two cups of powdered sugar in a large bowl, mixing well until fully combined.</p>

<p>Three egg whites should be beaten in a separate bowl with one teaspoon of cream of tartar then added on top.</p>

<p>Once the egg turns white, it's time to slowly add the sugar, mixing vigorously until stiff peaks form in the mixture.</p>

<p>Flour and a quarter cup of sugar should then be tipped in and folded gently until the mixture gathers a dense, lava-like consistency.</p>

<p>Once this has been achieved, load the mixture into a piping bag and squeeze small discs onto a baking tray covered with grease-proof paper. </p>

<p>For the shells:</p>

<p>1 cup almond flour</p>

<p>2 cups powdered sugar</p>

<p>1/4 cup sugar</p>

<p>3 egg whites (large eggs room temperature)</p>

<p>1 tsp cream of tartar</p>

<p>For the custard filling:</p>

<p>1/2 cup double cream</p>

<p>1/4 cup milk</p>

<p>1/4 cup sugar</p>

<p>2 large egg yolks</p>

<p>1 1/2 tbsp cornflour</p>

<p>1-1 1/2 tsp vanilla paste or extract</p>

<p>These discs will rise and expand in the oven, creating the shells you need to sandwich the crème brûlée between.</p>

<p>Bake the discs at a searing 300 degrees Celsius for 10 minutes until cooked but barely brown, then cool on a wire tray before matching shells into pairs of similar size.</p>

<p>Finally, the custard filling should be spooned onto one side of the shell and topped with a dollop of caramel sauce which can be bought ready-made from all leading supermarkets.</p>

<p>The caramelised topping can be achieved by sprinkling sugar over one side of each pair of shells and burning it gently with a kitchen blow torch.</p>

<p>Photos of the macarons have drawn delighted responses since they were shared online, with comments including 'delicious', 'looks great' and 'very impressive'. </p>

<p>'Those are beautiful, I bet they taste amazing,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second described the sweets as her 'two favourite desserts combined'.</p>
