<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The public may be denied a thrilling climax to the Wag-atha Christie saga after rival WAGs Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy agreed to try to settle their feud.</p>

<p>The Mail on Sunday can reveal they will take part in a so-called ‘meaning hearing’ at which a judge will rule on precisely what Mrs Rooney meant when she wrote on social media that it had been Mrs Vardy’s Instagram account leaking stories to a red-top newspaper.</p>

<p>The final four words of Mrs Rooney’s dramatic post in October said: ‘It’s... Rebekah Vardy’s account.’ The two women – wives of footballers Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy – disagree on whether the words infer that Ms Vardy, who has denied leaking any information, was personally involved or not.</p>

<p>Coleen Rooney was dubbed 'Wag-atha Christie' after the series of tweets </p>

<p>The development means Mrs Rooney, 34, will not be required to file a response to legal papers submitted by Mrs Vardy in July – and reduces the chances of a potentially bitter court battle being played out in public.</p>

<p>‘The thought of their dirty laundry being aired in public is not something either of the women want, but equally neither would back down,’ said a source.</p>

<p>‘So they have both agreed, jointly, that this would be a sensible way forward.</p>

<p>‘Establishing exactly what the accusation means will mean that the circus that surrounds it won’t have to happen.’ The source added: ‘They both hope it can put an end to what has been quite a distraction for them both.’</p>

<p>Insiders believe the judge’s decision will lead to a settlement of the feud which has seen Mrs Rooney hire celebrity barrister David Sherborne and 38-year-old Ms Vardy allege that the accusations caused her physical and mental anguish, including ‘severe panic attacks and anxiety’.</p>

<p>The spokesmen for Mrs Rooney and Mrs Vardy did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
