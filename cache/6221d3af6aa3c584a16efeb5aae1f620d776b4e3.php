<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Edinson Cavani could be heading for a reunion with Uruguay team-mate Luis Suarez after Atletico Madrid stepped up their interest by meeting his representatives.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old is a free agent having left Paris Saint-Germain in the summer after spending seven years in the French capital.</p>

<p>Real Madrid and Benfica have been linked with the former Napoli star this summer, but he has yet to find a new club.</p>

<p>Atletico Madrid met with the representatives of Edinson Cavani over a possible move</p>

<p>And, according to L'Equipe, Atletico have now thrown their hat into the ring, with club chiefs dispatched to the French capital on Monday to meet the player's agents.</p>

<p>They are due to meet in a hotel, where discussions will focus on the possibility of a two-year deal in the Spanish capital. </p>

<p>Cavani had spent a large chunk of lockdown in his native Uruguay, but has now been preparing himself physically for a return to football.</p>

<p>Diego Simeone is already close to the signature of one Uruguayan in the form of Luis Suarez</p>

<p>If that is with Atletico, it could be alongside his compatriot Suarez, who appears on the cusp of signing for Diego Simeone's side.</p>

<p>The striker left the Barcelona training ground in tears on Wednesday morning after saying his goodbyes to team-mates after being forced out of the club. </p>

<p>And Simeone could be set to make it a trio of Uruguayans, with the Argentine boss also keen on bringing Lucas Torreira in from Arsenal. </p>

<p>Lucas Torreira is also on the radar of Atletico Madrid, having fallen out of favour at Arsenal</p>
