<p>As reported by Beanyman Sports, Arnautovic said: 'I underestimated it. I didn't train. I didn't look after my body. I was eating. I was drinking fizzy drinks - Sprite, Coca Cola, Fanta - all these sugar drinks that are not good for the body. </p>

<p>'Eating at wrong times. Not sleeping, because when I came to China it took me about three weeks until I could adapt to the time. I went to bed at 6, 7 o'clock in the morning. I woke up 3, 4 o'clock in the afternoon, went to training, stayed up again all night, eating at wrong times.'</p>
