<p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed that the company would be paying users who complete surveys or deactivate as part of its research in a tweet Thursday.</p>

<p>'Anyone who chooses to opt in – whether it's completing surveys or deactivating FB or IG for a period of time – will be compensated,' Liz Bourgeous, a Facebook spokesperson, wrote.</p>

<p>'This is fairly standard for this type of academic research.'</p>

<p>The note includes a statement that notes users who opt-in for the study will be asked to take a survey following the November 3 US presidential election.</p>

<p>The second portion of the note prompts users to select a pay rate, starting at $10 per week to $20 per week. Facebook shared a report August 31 revealing its plans conduct research ahead of the election with an outside team of experts</p>

<p>Facebook shared a report August 31 revealing its plans conduct research ahead of the election with an outside team of experts who will delve into how social media products may impact voting.</p>

<p>'To continue to amplify all that is good for democracy on social media, and mitigate against that which is not, we need more objective, dispassionate, empirically grounded research,' Facebook explained in a blog post.</p>

<p>'That's why today we are announcing a new research partnership to better understand the impact of Facebook and Instagram on key political attitudes and behaviors during the US 2020 elections.'</p>

<p>The post say that scientific samples of people in the US will be selected to participate in the study and will receive a notification in either Facebook or Instagram.</p>

<p>And the firm expects between 200,000 and 400,000 users will choose to be involved in the study that includes surveys and 'agreeing to see a different product experience.'</p>

<p>However, Facebook says 'none of the survey data collected for this research effort from consented research participants will be used for ads targeting.</p>

<p>Along with understanding the correlation between social media and democracy, the Mark Zuckerberg-owned platform aims to use their research 'to protect elections.'</p>

<p>'As a company, we've looked hard at what went wrong with Russian interference in 2016 and made some big changes,' reads the report.</p>

<p>'There are now three times as many people working on safety and security issues, more than 35,000 in total, and we work closely with government and law enforcement.'</p>

<p>'Facebook has helped fight interference in more than 200 elections since 2017 and reduced fake news on its platform by more than 50%, according to independent studies.'</p>
