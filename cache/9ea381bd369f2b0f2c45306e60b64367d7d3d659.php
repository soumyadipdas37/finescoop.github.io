<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Woolworths will roll out a new high-technology camera system to keep count of customers and ensure stores are COVID-safe during the Christmas rush.</p>

<p>The supermarket giant will set up small 3D cameras at the entrance and exit of stores to monitor how many shoppers are coming in and out.</p>

<p>To keep the privacy of shoppers, the cameras will only recognise them as blurred circular shapes known as 'blobs' which is a scientific term for 'binary large objects'.</p>

<p>The service will mean staff members won't have to manually count each shopper coming into the store and the system will alert workers when too many are inside. </p>

<p>Melbourne shoppers can expect to see the cameras rolled out in the coming weeks as Woolworths plans to have them installed across the country.</p>

<p>A Woolworths spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia the footage taken will only be stored for a limited amount of time.   </p>

<p>'The safety of our team and customers is our top priority and we're determined to ensure it's a COVIDsafe Christmas at Woolworths this year,' the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>'We've been doing manual store counts to regulate the number of customers in our stores for many months now.</p>

<p>'As we head into the busy Christmas season, we'll be trialling new technology at our store entry points to keep track of customer numbers.</p>

<p>'If the number of customers hits the store's limit, our team will be notified in an app and implement queuing, just as they do with manual counts now.'</p>

<p>Earlier in the year Woolworths rolled out the Q-Tracker system which enabled customers to see how busy a store was and even book in to go shopping at certain times.</p>

<p>The new technology will work alongside this system. </p>

<p>Bunnings Warehouse is also preparing to launch a service that involves workers counting customers via an app.</p>

<p>Staff will then be alerted by support offices if the number of shoppers is too high. </p>

<p>The service is expected to be rolled out in time for Christmas </p>

<p>The new system will work with the Q-Tracker system which enables shoppers to see how busy Woolworths stores are (pictured people line up outside Woolworths metro store in Melbourne)</p>
