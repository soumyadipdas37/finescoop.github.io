<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Premier Daniel Andrews has warned 'thousands' of Victorians would die if strict coronavirus restrictions were to be lifted.</p>

<p>Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne, and Stage Three in the rest of the state, are set to lift on September 13 at 11.59pm after weeks of enduring the miserable lockdown.</p>

<p>But speaking on Saturday, a day ahead of his announcement on easing restrictions, Mr Andrews said lockdown was unlikely to end.</p>

<p>'To open up with those numbers would, of course, see the total number of coronavirus infections explode,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>'It would see many, many hundreds, indeed thousands, of Victorians infected with this virus. </p>

<p>While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured) on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage Four restrictions</p>

<p>'So, as frustrating, as challenging as it is, we need to stay the course on this. </p>

<p>'That’s why tomorrow we will outline a road map to ease these important restrictions, to ease out of the second wave, once it’s appropriately and properly defeated. Truly defeated.'</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 76 new coronavirus cases and 11 deaths on Saturday, with the welcome infection numbers coming after a spike earlier in the week saw 113 new cases after days of double digit transmission.</p>

<p>Friday was Victoria's deadliest day of the pandemic so far, with 59 deaths announced - but 50 of those had occurred back in July and August in aged care homes.</p>

<p>The new deaths come as bombshell leaked documents reveal Melbourne's strict stage four lockdown could be extended (pictured, police roam Melbourne on Thursday) </p>

<p>Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown, with the rest of the state in Stage Three - regardless of how many coronavirus cases towns have - had come under increasing scrutiny as the numbers fall.</p>

<p>Bombshell leaked documents revealed on Thursday that Melbourne's strict Stage Four lockdown could be extended by another two weeks. </p>

<p>A top secret draft for Victoria’s recovery appeared to reveal the government's plan to extend the 8pm-5am curfew and keep restrictions on businesses for an additional two weeks.</p>

<p>While the Victorian government has claimed the leaked map is 'out of date', Mr Andrews on Thursday refused to rule out continuing Stage Four restrictions.</p>

<p>If COVID-19 infections were to spread out-of-control, Australia's health system could become overwhelmed, according to modelling by the Grattan Institute (pictured, their report)</p>

<p>‘Everything is on the table,’ he admitted. ‘It will be driven by the data and the science, how many cases there are, the types of cases there are.’ </p>

<p>According to the road map, residents will be given the luxury of two hours of exercise a day, which can be split into two sessions, from September 14 - the official date Stage Four comes to an end.</p>

<p>The decision will be announced on Sunday. </p>

<p>Single people and single parents would also be given the right to have a nominated visitor at their home.</p>

<p>According to the report, which was obtained by the Herald Sun, there are bigger changes coming from September 28, which includes the curfew being lifted and increased social gatherings. </p>

<p>But the Victorian Chamber of Commerce has denied there is a plan to extend Stage Four lockdown by two weeks - claiming it is out of date.</p>

<p>State of disaster: Increased police powers to enforce the lockdown. Cautions will no longer be issued, only $1,652 fines or court summons</p>

<p>Curfew: No one allowed outside 8pm to 5am except for work, medical, caregiving - no shopping or exercising</p>

<p>Distance limit: Shopping and exercise can only be done 5km from home </p>

<p>Exercise: All recreational activity is banned and you can only exercise, with one other person, for one hour a day</p>

<p>Partners: You can visit a boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't live with you, even if they live more than 5km away </p>

<p>Shopping: Only one person can go shopping per household per day</p>

<p>Cafes and restaurants stay open for takeaway, as do supermarkets, etc</p>

<p>Schools: All students learning from home unless they are vulnerable or parents are essential workers. Kindy and childcare closed</p>

<p>Funerals: No change to funeral limits, but only 10 mourners can leave Melbourne to regional Victoria for one</p>

<p>Weddings: Completely banned</p>

<p>Public transport: Slashed after 8pm and cancelled late at night </p>
