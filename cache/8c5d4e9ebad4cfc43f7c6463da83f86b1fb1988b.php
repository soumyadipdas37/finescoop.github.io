<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>AFL star Harley Bennell has been rushed to hospital following a night out on the Gold Coast - just hours after he announced his retirement in the wake of a COVID-19 breach.</p>

<p>The Melbourne Demons player was ordered to leave Queensland after breaking the club bubble to visit an 'unapproved premises' in Maroochydore on September 19.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old retired after the incident on Monday, while the Demons were fined $50,000.</p>

<p>Despite his orders from the AFL, Bennell remained on the Gold Coast with friends while the Demons have been trying to organise his flight home to Perth.</p>

<p>Bennell was reportedly taken to hospital on Monday night after police were called to the Aria building at Broadbeach following reports of a disturbance at about 8pm.</p>

<p>Sources told The Courier-Mail Bennell was heavily intoxicated after celebrating the end of his AFL career and officers decided to call an ambulance.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old (pictured in action for The Demons) breached the AFL's COVID-19 return to play safety protocols to visit an 'unapproved premises' in Maroochydore on September 19</p>

<p>Bennell's partner Amy Crellin and their child already left the state in the days after his coronavirus breach.</p>

<p>She is pregnant with the couple's second child.  </p>

<p>Bennell's mum Kayleen said she was worried about her son's mental state after he announced his retirement.</p>

<p>'Very disappointing... Knowing my son is still stuck in Queensland with no family support,' she wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I'm his mother and I'm very concerned for his well-being and mental state.' </p>

<p>Kayleen shared her worries to a Facebook group for The Demons, alongside screenshots of AFL fans slamming her son.</p>

<p>'You so called humans want to discuss how he upset you all,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'What gives you the right to still call him names?' </p>

<p>Earlier, Melbourne CEO Gary Pert said Bennell's actions were selfish and a 'clear breach' of the AFL's COVID-19 protocols.  </p>

<p>'He has made a very poor decision, which is incredibly disappointing,' Pert said.</p>

<p>'He has not only put himself, his teammates and the competition at risk, but he has failed to live up to the values of the Melbourne Football Club.'</p>

<p>Pert apologised for the midfielder's behaviour and said the club accepted the $50,000 fine. </p>

<p>Upon learning of a potential breach, the Demons immediately notified the AFL, which investigated the matter. </p>

<p>AFL General Counsel Andrew Dillon said the AFL's protocols are the competition's license to play and anyone breaching them will be held to account.</p>

<p>'Harley knew the rules and could have put his club and the competition at risk on the eve of a finals campaign,' Dillon said.</p>

<p>The midfielder and former No.2 draft pick took to social media to call time on his rollercoaster 88-game career, which began in 2011 at Gold Coast.</p>

<p>Posting a photo on Instagram of himself in a jumper at all three of his AFL clubs - the Suns, Fremantle and the Demons - Bennell said it had been the 'best 10 years of my life'.</p>

<p>'Thank you to everyone that was involved. It was an awesome ride,' Bennell wrote. </p>

<p>Bennell started his AFL career with the Gold Coast Suns (pictured) where he enjoyed a breakout season in 2012</p>

<p>Bennell appeared set to earn a new contract with the club before the indiscretion after playing five games in his first season at Melbourne.</p>

<p>Injuries kept him to just two games in a four-year stint at Fremantle and he departed the Dockers in July 2019.</p>

<p>Melbourne acknowledged Bennell's retirement, posting on social media: 'Wishing you all the best for the future, Harley'.</p>

<p>Bennell played his best football at the Suns, enjoying a breakout season in 2012 when he finished second in the club's best-and-fairest behind Gary Ablett Jnr.</p>

<p>Disciplinary issues saw him fall out-of-favour at Gold Coast and he was traded to Fremantle at the end of the 2015 season. </p>

<p>Bennell (pictured with girlfriend Amy Crellin) announced his retirement on Monday in the wake of his COVID breach</p>

<p>On August 24, Bennell's partner Amy announced the pair were expecting their second child.</p>

<p>'Baby Number two on the way,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Thanks to our hub fam for making it special.'</p>

<p>The couple are proud parents to daughter Carter-Ivy, who they often share happy snaps of on their Instagram profiles.  </p>
