<p>Season three of Selling Sunset saw Christine tie the knot with her partner at a downtown Los Angeles cathedral in December 2019, following a whirlwind romance.  </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Christine detailed the ins and outs of her daily routine on the show in an interview with Vogue magazine.</p>

<p>The Oppenheim Group employee told the publication: 'I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of makeup. How I look on [Selling Sunset] is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>'When it comes to the show, I don’t do my own hair. I do my own makeup because I love doing it. The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two and a half to three hours. My glam isn’t cheap, either — $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It’s expensive to look this cheap.</p>

<p>'When it comes to the show, I don’t do my own hair': The media personality is known for her Rapunzel-inspired tresses</p>

<p>'It’s important in a world where there’s this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia. People think that [things are] real, and they’re not.' </p>

<p>The blonde recently admitted she  has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on the Netflix hit. </p>

<p>The siren told The Sunday Times: 'People that don't know me say hurtful things. I'm just like, "Ugh, whatever." I don't know these people. </p>

<p>'But when I hear stuff from other people… That's upsetting. Sometimes, it hurts my feelings. Sometimes, it makes me cry.'</p>

<p>Although she's as vulnerable as the next person, Christine clarified she has no intention of toning down her villainous persona.</p>
