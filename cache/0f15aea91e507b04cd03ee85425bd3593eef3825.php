<p>The Walking Dogs! Actor Andrew Lincoln cut a casual figure as he took his two adorable pups for a stroll in Wiltshire on Sunday</p>

<p>Andrew appeared to be in good spirits as he made his way along the side of the road with a blue jumper slung over one shoulder.</p>

<p>He completed his countryside chic ensemble with a pair of sturdy walking shoes and co-ordinated his dog lead to his navy clothes. </p>

<p>The hunky star also sported a slightly more rugged appearance during the outing, with his grey beard well groomed and curly locks looking shorter than usual. </p>

<p>Matchy matchy: Andrew also opted for a blue dog lead, coordinating with his own navy attire</p>

<p>It comes after it was revealed that Andrew has still never watched an episode of The Walking Dead, despite becoming one of its biggest stars. </p>

<p>Andrew famously said in a 2017 interview: 'I’m choosing to ignore the whole thing. I don’t watch the show at all. I am allergic to my own face.'</p>

<p>And although the actor left the series as Rick Grimes towards the start of Season 9, according to Walking Dead chief content officer Scott Gimple, he has still not watched the show.</p>

<p>'No, he has not watched it,' Gimple said at a virtual Comic-Con panel for upcoming The Walking Dead: World Beyond spin-off series.</p>

<p>'I will say, one time I was doing a DVD commentary with him on an episode he wasn't in, 'The Grove.' Five minutes into it, I was like, "You're not watching this, are you?" He's like, "No, no I'm not,"' Gimple added.</p>

<p>Andrew also told Entertainment Weekly in 2013 that the 'original reason' he doesn't like watching is because 'I don't actually enjoy looking at myself.' </p>

<p>He added that watching his own work 'defeats the object of what I want to do as an actor, which is to try and be in the role and not be self-conscious.' </p>

<p>The actor added that 'the fun bit' is actually working on the show, adding: 'I love that. That's the exciting thing for me.' </p>

<p>Andrew's Rick Grimes, a former Georgia sheriff before the zombie invasion, has been the centerpiece of the show since it debuted in 2010.</p>

<p>The actor had originally planned on leaving the show after Season 8, though his exit didn't come until the fifth episode of Season 9, when Grimes was taken by a mysterious group.</p>

<p>It was revealed in a November 2018 episode of the after-show Talking Dead that Grimes will return in a trilogy of Walking Dead films.</p>
