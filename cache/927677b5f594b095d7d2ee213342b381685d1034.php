<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia's top grain exporter has been banned from sending barley to China after disputed claims pests were found in multiple shipments.</p>

<p>West Australian grain handler CBH vowed to fight the 'extremely disappointing' decision, which appears to be the latest trade strike fuelled by diplomatic tensions.</p>

<p>Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said the federal government wanted to get to the bottom of the situation.</p>

<p>'We do respect the fact that China - like any other country would, like we would - has got quarantine inspection arrangements,' he told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'We will be working with the company once we are aware of all the facts to make the appropriate representations.'</p>

<p>China's customs department confirmed the decision on Tuesday, saying quarantine pests were found in CBH barley exports multiple times.</p>

<p>But the grain cooperative insists there is no evidence to support the claim.</p>

<p>'CBH is therefore extremely disappointed the suspension has been put in place and will continue to work with the Australian government to challenge the suspension,' the exporter said.</p>

<p>Australian farmers were already effectively blocked from exporting barley to China, which imposed tariffs of 80.5 per cent on the commodity in June.</p>

<p>Senator Cormann said CBH had a great track record, but declined to speculate if diplomatic issues had sparked the ban.</p>

<p>'The truth is, Australia's grain products, Australia's barley products, are highly regarded all around the world,' he said.</p>

<p>'If there is less opportunity to export high-quality Australian grain into China there will be more opportunity to export grain into other markets around the world.'</p>

<p>China has also launched anti-dumping investigations into Australian wine and suspended beef imports from five Queensland abattoirs.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a constitutional power play last week, signalling the Commonwealth would gain veto power over state government agreements with foreign nations.</p>

<p>The beefed-up powers would allow the foreign minister to pulp Victoria's belt and road initiative agreement with Beijing.</p>

<p>China's deputy ambassador Wang Xining has revealed the depth of anger towards Australia over its push for an inquiry into the origins of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Grain traders have said while the CBH suspension will have limited impact, it signals a further deterioration in the Australia-China relationship.</p>
