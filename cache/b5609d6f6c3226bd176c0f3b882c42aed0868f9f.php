<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Canberra Raiders forward Sia Soliola has revealed the extreme measures he took to try and eat fast food in his recovery from a horrific facial injury.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old was part of a brutal head clash with St George Illawarra star Blake Lawrie in July, leaving him with seven facial fractures that needed 20 screws to fix.</p>

<p>The former Samoan and New Zealand international took to Instagram to post an x-ray of the damage after the clash, with the caption 'at least my teeth are in tact'. </p>

<p>He was told by doctors he could only eat soft foods in recovery, which lead to an experimental approach to his diet. </p>

<p>Sia Soliola posted this x-ray to Instagram after he suffered seven facial fractures after a head clash on the field in July</p>

<p>'I actually tried to blend KFC,' Soliola told NRL.com. </p>

<p>'It was all soft foods so everything had to be blended. I actually had the idea to blend KFC, pizza, a Big Mac or pretty much anything.'</p>

<p>Soliola was predicted to miss the rest of the season with the injury, but he has been named in the Raiders squad for a dramatic comeback this weekend.</p>

<p>The 208-game veteran set himself the goal of returning to the field in Round 19, where he will join his teammates against the New Zealand Warriors on Sunday.</p>

<p>'It was my full face but given the experience I had with previous fractures I was quite confident that I could maybe squeeze one or two games in so it is nice when you have a vision and it comes to fruition,' Soliola said.</p>

<p>His return gives the Raiders a welcome boost in their push to crack the top four and a guaranteed birth into the second week of the finals.</p>

<p>Soliola said the injury was not too invasive to his fitness and allowed him to keep training while in recovery, with only one disadvantage. </p>

<p>'The only downside was that I couldn't bite, for obvious reasons,' he said.</p>
