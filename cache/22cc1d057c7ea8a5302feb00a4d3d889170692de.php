<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A top university in Australia is preparing to slash hundreds of jobs from its already dwindling workforce due to COVID-19 financial strain.</p>

<p>The Australian National University in Canberra estimates it will cut an additional 215 staff in the next nine months, despite having made 250 voluntary redundancies.</p>

<p>The university confirmed on Wednesday cuts were being made due to financial strain, and lack of international student numbers, during the pandemic.</p>

<p>ANU said it planned to save $130million by 2023 and would seek further voluntary redundancies but slash paid positions if necessary. </p>

<p>The Australian National University in Canberra estimates it will cut an additional 215 staff in the next nine months, despite having made 250 voluntary redundancies.</p>

<p>'Our international student numbers are down to below 2017 levels and in our best guess scenario will likely fall further in 2021 (a 30 percent reduction from 2019), which is a significant strain on our budget,' the university stated in its recovery plan. </p>

<p>ANU's announcement comes 256 staff at the University of NSW are reported to lose their jobs due to similar cost pressures.</p>

<p>'The stark reality is: we need to save money, and this will mean spending a lot less, both on our non-salary expenditure, but also on salaries,' ANU vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt said in an open letter to staff.</p>

<p>'This is not a course of action we wanted to take, but it is our only viable option going forward if we want to remain a sustainable, stable university.</p>

<p>'The need for our university and its mission is clear, and we must make sure we can deliver on that mission, and not be a hollowed-out shell of our former selves.' </p>

<p>ANU is looking to limit the use of consultants and contractors, it said, as well as reduce travel plans and pursue flexible working arrangements.</p>

<p>The university added it was on track to meet its target of retaining $250million - or three months' operation expenses - by the end of 2020 to ensure it could pay its expenses, such as salaries and bills.</p>

<p>It was, however, facing a a deficit of $192million in 2021, as stated in its recovery plan, which will flow into 2022 and 2023 with a similar magnitude per annum. </p>

<p>'We must adapt to our new financial circumstances in 2021 to remain financially sustainable and avoid placing an unnecessary cost and debt burden on the University's future,' ANU said.</p>

<p>'In order to place ANU on a sustainable expenditure footing and to accommodate projected lower levels of revenue, an ongoing expenditure reduction of approximately $103 million per annum is required from 2021. '</p>
