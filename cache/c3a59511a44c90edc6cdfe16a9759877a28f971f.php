<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry should be stripped of his royal title because he is currently 'exploiting' it for his personal financial gain, a royal author has claimed. </p>

<p>Former MP Norman Baker, 63, author of What The Royal Family Don't Want You To Know, argued the Duke of Sussex, 36, should be made to live as a private individual, after a Tatler survey found two thirds of Britons think he and Meghan, 39, should be stripped of their HRH titles. </p>

<p>Mr Baker argued Harry should not be allowed to keep his HRH title because he is no longer representing the British royal family overseas and is cashing in on his pedigree.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drew criticism last week after they commented publicly on the US elections and urged people to register to vote. </p>

<p>Speaking on Good Morning Britain today, Mr Baker said: 'Harry clearly is exploiting the Buckingham palace connection, if he wants to run away and do Netflix documentaries, that's fine, do it as a private individual.</p>

<p>Royal experts have clashed over whether Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, pictured the Commonwealth Day Service, should have their titles removed</p>

<p>Former MP and author of What The Royal Family Don't Want You To Know Norman Baker, 63, (pictured) appeared on GMB this morning to discuss the issue </p>

<p>'HRH means he's representing Britain abroad, but he's not. He's divorced himself from the royal family in practical terms, but not titular terms.</p>

<p>He continued: 'If he keep his HRH title he is still eligible for public support from the taxpayer.</p>

<p>'For example, we're paying up to a million to pay for security personnel to wander around Frogmore cottage, we'll pay for his travel when he comes back to the UK.</p>

<p>He added: 'Harry clearly is exploiting the Buckingham palace connection, if he wants to run away and do Netflix documentaries, that's fine, do it as a private individual.' </p>

<p>However royal expert Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, argued it makes no difference whether Harry had a royal title or not because he is a 'prince by blood' and will capitalise on his royal connections with or without the official HRH title. </p>

<p>She said: 'The title was a gift of the queen on their wedding day, to one of her favourite grandchildren and to his future wife. </p>

<p>Royal commentator Ingrid Seward, 72, also appeared and argued that taking away their titles will achieve nothing as Harry is a 'prince by blood'</p>

<p>Norman, from Lewes in East Sussex, believes Harry is 'exploiting' his royal connections, and that he and Meghan weren't offered their 'huge deal' for their 'interesting views'</p>

<p>'It's really something it would be very churlish, I feel, to say they can't have anymore, everyone knows them as Harry and Megan. </p>

<p>'Yes I agree they're trading off their connections, but that's who they are, Harry is a prince of the blood and you can't take that away from him.' </p>

<p>Viewers were divided over the issue, with some believing they should not keep their title. </p>

<p>One raged: 'If they truly wanted to live in privacy as they say, then they wouldn't be preaching their cr*p constantly, however these attention seeking numpty's never really wanted anonymity " especially her" so leave them do it without the privilege of any royal title' </p>

<p>Another agreed: 'Well.... yeah? You can’t be a member of the royals, sworn to impartiality and make a damn political ad????' </p>

<p>However others disagreed, with one writing: 'It makes no difference if Harry has a title or not, the fact is he is Royal, people are interested in them.' </p>

<p>Another said: 'Don’t slate Harry and Meghan slate Netflix for leaching of them. Good luck them'. </p>

<p>Viewers were divided over the issue, with some believing they should not keep their title, while others felt it won't make much of a difference </p>
