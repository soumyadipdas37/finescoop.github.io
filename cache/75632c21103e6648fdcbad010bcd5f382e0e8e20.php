<p>The on-board footage was recorded by the drone's owner in his backyard in Haddonfield, New Jersey. </p>

<p>A red-tailed hawk was caught on camera launching a vicious attack on a drone which had flown too close to the bird's perch</p>

<p>In the clip, the drone begins sweeping up and down through a series of fir trees in the owner's back yard.</p>

<p>The operator on the ground then spots a large bird of prey perched among the branches and moves the drone in for a closer look. </p>

<p>The bird, which appears to be a red-tailed hawk, spots the device and begins eagerly eyeing it up.</p>

<p>It tilts its head from one side to the other repeatedly as the drone moves in even closer.</p>

<p>The drone continues to move in even closer before the bird suddenly launches itself off the branch towards the device with its wings outstretched</p>

<p>The device is sent hurtling through the fir trees as it plummets toward the ground before landing in the grass</p>

<p>The drone is sent hurtling toward the ground before landing in the grass. </p>

<p>Speaking after the incident, the drone's owner said: 'I was flying my drone in my backyard, when I noticed a large bird in a nearby tree watching intently. </p>

<p>'I flew over to find the bird with the drone to get a closer look, and the bird took off and knocked it out of the sky. </p>

<p>'After viewing the footage, it looks like the bird was a red-tailed hawk.'  </p>

<p>Red-tailed hawks are renowned for their predatory instincts with attacks frequently reported. </p>

<p>Last year, one family was left terrified when a hawk swooped down into their backyard in Las Vegas as it attacked their Yorkshire Terrier. </p>

<p>There have also been sighting of the birds scooping up rats, squirrels and bats - with 85 per cent of their diet being made up of rodents.  </p>
