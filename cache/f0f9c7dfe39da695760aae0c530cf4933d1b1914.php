<p>Out and about: Colton Underwood is pictured out in LA on Tuesday amid the continuing drama in his personal life</p>

<p>Earlier this month Colton's ex-girlfriend and former Bachelor costar Cassie Randolph was granted a restraining order against him.</p>

<p>Colton now has to stay at least 100 yards away from Cassie, 25, her home, her work and must not contact her and avoid all threatening behavior.</p>

<p>In her court filing Cassie attached photos of a tracking device she says Colton attached to the rear bumper of her car. She claims he admitted to attaching the device.</p>

<p>There will be a hearing in October where Colton will be able to tell his side of the story, TMZ reported.</p>

<p>The former couple started their romance on Underwood's 23rd season of The Bachelor, which aired in early 2019.</p>

<p>Chatting on the phone as he walked, the former pro footballer appeared to have just left a workout wearing shorts and sneakers</p>

<p>They announced their split in May of this year, though in her filing Randolph noted their split as occurring in April.</p>

<p>As well as planting the tracking device, she claims Colton turned up uninvited at her various residences among other allegations.</p>

<p>She went on to allege that he takes 'obsessive walks' to her apartment and lingered outside of her bedroom window at her parent's beach house at 2 A.M.</p>

<p>Along with physical behavior, Cassie also claimed that the former football player has been sending her harassing text messages accusing her of spending time with her ex-boyfriend, among other messages.</p>

<p>Fairytale is over: Earlier this month Colton's ex-girlfriend and former Bachelor costar Cassie Randolph was granted a restraining order against him. The former couple started their romance on Underwood's 23rd season of The Bachelor, which aired in early 2019</p>

<p>Restraining order: Colton now has to stay at least 100 yards away from Cassie, 25, her home, her work and must not contact her and avoid all threatening behavior</p>

<p>The former football player has called her 'selfish' and 'shady' in several of the messages seen by E! News from documents pertaining to the order.</p>

<p>In the paperwork, Cassie also alleged that Underwood sent anonymous text messages to her and himself to say he was also the victim of a stalker, though she claims he later confessed to that as well.</p>

<p>According to the filing, Colton 'used alias phone numbers to anonymously send harassing text messages at all hours of the day to Ms. Randolph and to her friends. Mr. Underwood also sent harassing text messages to himself pretending to also be a victim of the anonymous stalker… He later admitted to being the one sending the messages.' </p>

<p>In July, Cassie accused her ex of trying to 'monetize' their split by writing about it in the upcoming second edition of his book without her prior approval and though they agreed to remain silent on the reasons of the split. </p>

<p>Broken: The couple lived together when quarantine started in March but things quickly went downhill and they announced their split in May</p>
