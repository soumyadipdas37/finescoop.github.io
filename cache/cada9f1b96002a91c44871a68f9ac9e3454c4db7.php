<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 13-year-old autistic boy has been shot multiple times after his mother called the police for help when he was having a mental breakdown in Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Golda Barton called the police for a crisis intervention team (CIT) when her son Linden Cameron, who has Asperger's, started suffering severe separation anxiety over her going back to work.</p>

<p>Barton said that police told her the CIT would 'deescalate the situation using the most minimal force possible' at her home in the Glendale neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But she said that within less than five minutes of the police arriving she heard an officer shout at the boy 'get on the ground,' before several shots were fired.</p>

<p>Linden Cameron, from Glendale, Salt Lake City, Utah, was shot several times by police on Friday night after his mother called for assistance dealing with a psychiatric episode</p>

<p>Linden Cameron, who remains in hospital, suffered injuries to his shoulders, both ankles, intestines and bladder</p>

<p>Barton told KUTV: 'I said, he's unarmed, he doesn't have anything, he just gets mad and he starts yelling and screaming. He's a kid he's trying to get attention, he doesn't know how to regulate.'</p>

<p>She added: 'He's a small child. Why didn't you just tackle him? He's a baby. He has mental issues.'</p>

<p>She said the officers told her to wait outside while they want inside the property and then soon after she heard the gunshots.</p>

<p>Barton said she thought her son was dead because the officers didn't immediately say what had happened.</p>

<p>In addition, she claims she heard one of the officers say to the other: 'He's just a child, what are you doing?'</p>

<p>Linden Cameron, who remains in hospital, suffered injuries to his shoulders, both ankles, intestines and bladder.</p>

<p>Salt Lake City Police Department, who are investigating the circumstances, said that it was called to reports of a 'violent psych issue' and that the teenager was 'making threats to some folks with a weapon.'</p>

<p>There was no indication over whether a weapon had been found, but police said they were not certain there wasn't one.</p>

<p>Golda Barton said she called police when her autistic son suffered a mental breakdown because she was going back to work</p>

<p>Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall said in a statement Sunday: 'While the full details of this incident are yet to be released as an investigation takes place, I will say that I am thankful this young boy is alive and no one else was injured.</p>

<p>'No matter the circumstances, what happened on Friday night is a tragedy and I expect this investigation to be handled swiftly and transparently for the sake of everyone involved.'</p>

<p>Linden Cameron's father drove down from Iowa immediately after hearing the news, Barton said.</p>

<p>'He's an amazing father,' she told KUTV.</p>
