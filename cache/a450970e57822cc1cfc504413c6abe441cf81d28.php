<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Author and journalist Sarah Wilson has revealed the 'kindness of strangers' has saved her 'several times' during a candid discussion on suicide.  </p>

<p>The writer appeared on the ABC's Q&amp;A program on Monday night for a segment on 'The Age of Loneliness'.</p>

<p>A mother whose 41-year-old son took his own life in 2017 asked the panel for advice on how people can help someone they are worried about. </p>

<p>'He had numerous neighbours, friends and various organisations that he was in,' the she said.</p>

<p>'It appears he kept his worries to himself, not really opening up to anyone.'</p>

<p>Sarah Wilson (pictured) appeared on ABC's Q&amp;A on Monday night for a segment on 'The Age of Loneliness'</p>

<p>In response, Wilson said she had found strength in her darker times by talking to people a 'couple of times removed'. </p>

<p>'In terms of what to do if you feel you don’t know a direct connect, I can speak from experience that it's often been the kindness of strangers, or friends that are a couple of times removed that have saved me,' she said. </p>

<p>Host Hamish Macdonald asked the self-help author if it was easier to be approached by an acquaintance.</p>

<p>'I don't know it was easier,' she replied, 'They were [just] the ones brave enough.'</p>

<p>'And maybe it is easier when you're not intimately connected. But absolutely, I have appreciated it and I would say it saved me several times.</p>

<p>'And the one other thing I would say is when you're in that position, sometimes you do need to be told what you need to be asked.</p>

<p>Wilson said the 'kindness of strangers' had saved her several times during darker times</p>

<p>'And so I wouldn't be afraid of asking the question because quite often you’re in a space where you can’t make those judgements for yourself, so you feel very safe somebody has made that judgment for you.' </p>

<p>Wilson was joined on the panel by psychologist Hugh Mackay, Gotcha4Life founder Gus Worland, Michelle Lim of Ending Loneliness Together and Rosemary Kayess from the Disability Innovation Institute UNSW.</p>

<p>Discussions centred on the impacts of social media, how to access support and how to deal with loneliness. </p>

<p>Recent research by the Australian Psychological Society found one in four Australian adults are lonely, and are consequently 15.2 per cent more likely to be depressed.</p>

<p>A growing body of evidence indicates loneliness can also be detrimental to physical health, including increasing the risk of premature death.</p>

<p>Ms Kayess said critical care decisions made by the government when the coronavirus outbreak hit made her feel invaluable. </p>

<p>'It was such a visceral reaction that I had. It was so in my face that I was dispensable. My life wasn't valued. And I was dispensable,' she said. </p>

<p>'Now I had this illusion that I was ... doing a pretty good job with my life, working and I own my home, and I love my family, and I‘ve got friends and thought I was contributing, but when it came down to it, I was dispensable.</p>

<p>'I was not one of the real people. And, yeah, it hit me in the face.</p>

<p>'I was not alone. I think you speak to anybody with a disability, when that triage stuff was happening. And how do you think older people feel?</p>

<p>'Older people are really only ending up in aged care systems because of their impairments. And so, yeah, from the word go it‘s been reinforced to them.'</p>

<p>'They’re the collateral damage.'</p>
