<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Choosing clothes that are ethically produced has become a priority for many of us. </p>

<p>But what about the basics — bras and knickers that often need replacing sooner than other items?</p>

<p>After having three children, I've changed size more times than I can count, and I feel mindful of what happens to all the bras I ditch. </p>

<p>What's more, working from home has resulted in a sales surge for many lingerie brands.</p>

<p>Producing sustainable underwear is challenging, but a handful of brands have proved it is possible and CAMILLA RIDLEY_DAY has shared her top pics</p>

<p>However, producing sustainable underwear is challenging, hence why it's the last type of clothing to hop on the eco bandwagon. </p>

<p>A bra has up to 48 components, which can be hard to source, and the material needs good elasticity and has to stand up to repeat wear and washing.</p>

<p>But now a handful of brands have proved it is possible. Here, CAMILLA RIDLEY-DAY shares her top picks . . .</p>
