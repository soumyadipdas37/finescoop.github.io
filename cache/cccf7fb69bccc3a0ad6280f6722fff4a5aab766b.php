<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona midfielder Arturo Vidal has hit out at his own club for only having '13 professional players', so many youth products in the first team and relying too heavily on Lionel Messi.</p>

<p>The Catalan club are in crisis following a trophyless season, compounded by the shock 8-2 Champions League quarter-final defeat by Bayern Munich earlier this month. </p>

<p>New manager Ronald Koeman is planning an overhaul of the squad, which is likely to see experienced stars like Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Sergio Busquets make way for younger players, but Vidal claims that they need better players who are ready now rather than academy products.</p>

<p>Arturo Vidal has hit out at Barcelona for only having '13 professional players' in their squad</p>

<p>Speaking on YouTube, Vidal hinted that Barcelona have far too many young 'DNA' players </p>

<p>Vidal told Daniel Habif's YouTube channel: 'Barcelona have to change their way of thinking. Football has moved on a lot and the [whole] DNA [thing] is being left behind because other teams are improving in other aspects: football at the moment is more physical, more dependent on power and speed and the technical side is sometimes less important.</p>

<p>'The last three years are not what a team like Barcelona deserves. The best team in the world cannot have 13 professional players. You cannot always win with DNA.'</p>

<p>His rant has hit a nerve with the Barca faithful as Vidal is more  than hinting that the club is living in the past with its pretty passing football philosophy and its emphasis on the homegrown lightweight technical players. </p>

<p>Barca are famous for producing world-class talent at their La Masia academy with the likes of Messi, Gerard Pique and further back Xavi and Andres Iniesta graduating.</p>

<p>But Vidal appears angry that in the first team now there are not enough experienced pros he would trust beside him in the trenches.</p>

<p>The Chilean had sympathy for fellow South American Messi, who last week told Barca of his intention to leave. Manchester City is his most likely destination after almost 20 years in Catalonia.</p>

<p>'(Lionel) Messi is the best in the world, an extraterrestrial, but he needs help so that better results can be achieved,' Vidal added.</p>

<p>Messi believes he should be allowed to leave for free due to a contract clause but La Liga have said he is under the terms of his deal and his release clause stands at  £630m.</p>

<p>The Catalans lost the title to arch-rivals Real Madrid this summer, while they were also knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Athletic Bilbao earlier this year.  </p>

<p>The Chilean could leave Barcelona this summer and has been linked with a move to Inter Milan</p>

<p>Vidal, 33, is one of several players Koeman is showing the soor and has been linked with a move to Inter Milan. Rakitic, Samuel Umtiti and Suarez are also surplus to requirements with the Uruguay striker being told by the Dutch boss in a 60-second phonecall that his future lies elsewhere. Busquets and Jordi Alba could also be on the way out.</p>

<p>When asked whether Barcelona's players were 'transferable' this summer, Vidal said: 'I have never understood placing the players with that word. It is very ugly. </p>

<p>'If a player wants to leave or you want to sell him, find him a team but don't say so. It is to pass it on, and each person needs respect.'</p>

<p>Vidal (right) confirmed he would never join rivals Real Madrid due to the respect for Barca fans</p>

<p>Luis Suarez is set to leave Barcelona as new boss Ronald Koeman rings the changes</p>

<p>Vidal did confirm that he would not sign for Real Madrid as he has enjoyed a healthy relationship with the Barcelona faithful. </p>

<p>He added: 'I am in a situation of being thrown away to see if someone wants to receive me. </p>

<p>'I have earned the complete affection of the people of Barcelona, that is why I would not play for Real Madrid.'</p>

<p>Sergio Busquets is another long-serving Barcelona player who could be on his way out</p>
