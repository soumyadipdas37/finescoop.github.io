<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>MAC Cosmetics has a new face in the form of Grammy Award-winning singer and flamenco dancer Rosalia, who used her Spanish heritage to create a flame-red lipstick inspired by the traditional dance genre.  </p>

<p>The 26-year-old, who won the Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album earlier this year, was today named as the newest spokesmodel for the beauty brand's Viva Glam campaign - a charitable initiative founded in 1994.</p>

<p>Rosalia, who was born just outside of Barcelona, not only appears in a series of stunning campaign images for the brand, she also worked with MAC to create a special lipstick - the aptly named Viva Rosalia - which she says was inspired by her love of flamenco. </p>

<p>Star on the rise: Grammy Award-winning singer Rosalia has been revealed as the newest face of MAC Cosmetics' Viva Glam campaign  </p>

<p>Heritage: The 26-year-old stars in a stunning series of images for the brand - and she also teamed up with them on the launch of a new Viva Glam lipstick </p>

<p>'Red is my favorite color, it always reminds me of flamenco,' the singer - who began studying the dance genre when she was 16 - told Vogue. </p>

<p>She went on to explain that she found inspiration as a teenager from famous flamenco dancers like Lola Flores, an Andalusian performer who has been described as an 'icon' of local folklore - and who went on to appear in dozens of movies. </p>

<p>Rosalia revealed that she used to try and copy Lola's signature eyeliner look, explaining that she 'would draw a really, really long line around her eyes' to match the dancer's style.  </p>

<p>Much like her new Viva Glam lipstick - which will help to raise funds to aid people around the world who are living with HIV/AIDS - Rosalia's music is also heavily influenced by her Spanish heritage and her love of flamenco.</p>

<p>Her music has also always been closely tied to her passion for beauty as a form of expression, with the singer revealing that she would use her pre-performance glam sessions as a budding musician as a form of 'ritual' before going onstage.  </p>

<p>But Rosalia began playing with makeup years before she started performing at local bars and weddings at the age of 16, having first started experimenting with beauty as a child, using her mother's old beauty products to practice different looks on her sister Pilar.      </p>

<p>Her love of makeup was not the only factor that motivated Rosalia to team up with MAC's Viva Glam campaign however - she was also incredibly encouraged by the opportunity to help so many people around the world through the sale of her lipstick, particularly at a time when the pandemic has left hundreds of thousands in desperate need of aid. </p>

<p>'It’s an honor to be a part of this campaign and to be able to collaborate with MAC,' Rosalia told DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Vibrant: Named Viva Rosalia, the bold red shade was inspired by the singer's love of flamenco</p>

<p>Superstar: Rosalia, who was born just outside of Barcelona, has won five Latin Grammy Awards and earlier this year scooped a Grammy for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album</p>

<p>'The way [the brand] is using [its] platform, and how [it has] dedicated $10 million dollars to 250 organizations on the frontlines and serving communities affected by COIVD19; there is nothing more important than to help.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I feel very grateful and honored to be a part of a campaign that is helping the world we are living in. </p>

<p>'It is also my goal and very important to me to help MAC spread awareness about the health and rights for women and girls. My team is made up of women, and I feel like it’s very important that we always try to empower more women.' </p>

<p>MAC's latest Viva Glam contributions add to the impressive $500,000,000 that the campaign has raised since it first launched in 1994, and Rosalia's new campaign comes just weeks after the brand pledged to donate 100,000 lipsticks to healthcare workers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic.   </p>

<p>The beauty brand announced the new initiative - which was inspired by July 29's National Lipstick Day - last month, revealing at the time that it would send out products to 54 healthcare organizations throughout the US and Canada, including hospitals and LGBTQ community centers. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the brand explained that MAC wanted to thank frontline workers for 'their dedication and pioneering efforts for good' during these incredibly difficult times.  </p>

<p>'Lipsticks being donated are some of MAC’s most iconic shades: Lustre Lipstick in Lady Bug, Lustre Lipstick in Cockney, Lustre Lipstick in See Sheer, and Lustre Lipstick in Spice It Up,' the brand revealed.</p>

<p>And while a tube of lipstick might seem trivial to some, those on the frontlines are incredibly appreciative of the ongoing efforts to show gratitude towards those who have put themselves at greatest risk while helping others during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Giving back: Last month, MAC Cosmetics announced plans to donate 100,000 lipsticks to different healthcare organizations across North America  </p>

<p>As well as hospitals across a number of states, from New York to Chicago, MAC also sent its lipsticks to a host of other organizations, including the Los Angeles LGBT Center and God's Love We Deliver, a NYC-based charity that cooks and home-delivers medically tailored meals for people who are too sick to shop or cook for themselves. </p>

<p>'We are deeply honored to have the support from MAC Cosmetics as part of #NationalLipstickDay,' David Ludwigson, Vice President &amp; Chief Development Officer of God’s Love We Deliver, said. </p>

<p>'With the onset of COVID-19, God’s Love We Deliver has experienced a five-fold increase in demand for our medically tailored meals, and our staff and volunteers have truly risen to this challenge. </p>

<p>'We are extremely grateful to have the decades-long support from MAC Cosmetics, and we’re thrilled to gift these lipsticks as a thank you and as a special treat to our staff and volunteers for all of their tireless hard work.'</p>

<p>This latest initiative came just a few months after MAC pledged a whopping $10 million towards 250 organizations across the globe through its Viva Glam fund. </p>

<p>The money will be given to groups that have been at the forefront of the effort to stop the coronavirus pandemic - and to help 'support vulnerable communities' that have been so badly affected by COVID-19.   </p>

<p>As part of the ongoing initiative, MAC will donate 100 per cent of the selling price of its Viva Glam Lipstick to these organizations - while also calling on others to show their appreciation for healthcare workers through a new social media campaign, #MACKissofGratitude. </p>

<p>MAC makeup artists and employees the world over came together to take part in the movement, sharing a photo of themselves wearing their favorite lip color - while holding up their palm to show off a kiss mark.  </p>
