<p>Ines has been incredibly open about tweaking her appearance through cosmetic surgery.</p>

<p>Last year, she opened up about some of her procedures in an interview with Now to Love.</p>

<p>Back in May, Ines announced that she had launched a new YouTube channel to share lifestyle content with her fans. </p>
