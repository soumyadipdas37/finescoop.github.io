<p>'I would never have let anyone into my life like [the man in the tape, whom she was dating at the time]. I met the worst person I could meet and if I hadn't gone to Provo, I wouldn't have entertained the thought of letting him into my life. Provo affected my future relationships.'</p>

<p>'I feel so safe with him': The socialite has been dating entrepreneur Carter Reum for nine months</p>

<p>'From the moment I woke up until I went to bed, it was all day screaming in my face, yelling at me, continuous torture,' she previously told People.</p>

<p>The House of Wax actress continued: 'The staff would say terrible things. They were constantly making me feel bad about myself and bully me. I think it was their goal to break us down.</p>

<p>'And they were physically abusive, hitting and strangling us. They wanted to instill fear in the kids so we’d be too scared to disobey them.'</p>

<p>Hilton said she was subsequently placed in solitary confinement as punishment: 'They would use that as punishment, sometimes 20 hours a day.'</p>

<p>Reached for comment by People regarding Paris' accusations, the school said it went under new ownership after the heiress left the institution.</p>

<p>'We therefore cannot comment on the operations or patient experience prior to this time,' the school said.</p>
