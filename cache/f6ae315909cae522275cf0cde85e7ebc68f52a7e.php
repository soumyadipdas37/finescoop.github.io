<p>Inseparable: Katie Holmes cut a low-key figure as she enjoyed a relaxing stroll with her new chef boyfriend Emilio Vitolo Jr. in New York City on Wednesday </p>

<p>Adding some finishing touches, Katie opted for black flat ankle boots and a matching bucket bag.</p>

<p>The star left her brunette locks loose into a relaxed hairdo and appeared to go makeup-free during the stroll.</p>

<p>Katie took cautious measures amid the coronavirus crisis and wore a blue face mask in the city.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the 33-year-old chef opted for a pair of grey comfy-looking jogging bottoms and teamed it with a white T-shirt and matching shirt.</p>

<p>Comfort: The actress, 41, opted for a comfy look of black mom jeans and a white-and-red Gap hoodie while the 33-year-old chef wore a pair of grey comfy-looking jogging bottoms</p>

<p>Emilio finished his look with Converse trainers and a white flat cap as he joined Katie for a low-key stroll. </p>

<p>He serves as the chef at the popular Italian restaurant Emilio's Ballato in Manhattan, a family business owned by his father Emilio Vitolo Sr.</p>

<p>In its positive review of the eatery, New York Magazine noted the restaurant has a 'clubby' atmosphere, partly due to Emilio Sr., who decides which customers gets a table and in what order they'll be served from his regular table at the front.</p>

<p>Despite the insular style, plenty of celebrities have been drawn to the restaurant's classic Italian dishes, including former President Barack Obama and Hollywood stars Tom Hanks and Bradley Cooper. </p>

<p>Emilio and Katie were first linked on September 1, while on an apparent date at Mediterranean restaurant Antique Garage in Manhattan's SoHo neighbourhood.</p>

<p>But the romantic nature of their relationship was unveiled later that week, when they were spotted kissing passionately at Manhattan's Peasant Restaurant.</p>

<p>The relationship seems to be a drastic change from Katie's previous relationships, as she's been unabashedly open about her new beau.</p>

<p>In contrast, she began dating fellow actor Jamie Foxx, 52, in 2013, but the two kept their relationship private for years until going public at the Met Gala in May 2019, shortly before they broke up.</p>

<p>Moving on: Katie previously dated Jamie Foxx in 2013, following her 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, but they split in 2019 shortly after going public as a couple (pictured in May 2019)</p>

<p>The Dawson's Creek star can now often be seen hanging out with Emilio at his restaurant and packing on the PDA.   </p>

<p>Katie and Emilio's friendship has been growing since October 2019 after they were introduced by a mutual friend.  </p>

<p>Prior to coupling up with Jamie Foxx, Holmes was married to Hollywood icon Tom Cruise.</p>

<p>The couple began their whirlwind courtship in 2005 and were married in seven weeks. Katie filed for divorce in 2012, which was finalized after only ten days.</p>

<p>She and Cruise had welcomed their daughter Suri in 2006, who now spends her time with the actress, who has primary custody. </p>

<p>Former flame: Katie was famously married to Tom Cruise, 58, from 2006 until their dramatic divorce in 2012, and they share daughter Suri, 14, born in 2006 (pictured in 2011)</p>
