<p>While Nazlioglu, 39, and Eljaidi were cleared, removalist Ahmad Doudar, 40, was jailed on Thursday for disposing of the getaway car.</p>

<p>Doudar's role in the crime involved him picking up a hidden silver Aurion with a tow truck and intending to dispose of it, alongside others, the court heard.</p>

<p>Justice Robert Allan Hulme said on sentencing today: '(Mr Doudar) intended to assist in disposing of the vehicle in order to assist' in the murder. </p>

<p>In handing down his sentence Justice Robert Allan Hulme said Doudar's plea of guilty and the facts he had agreed to indicated he knew 'the brazen and brutal executioner.'</p>

<p>'The murder itself was horrifying. It was a dangerous and violent public execution. Mr Doudar knew this.'</p>

<p>The judge said murders like this 'do not happen by chance... they require the involvement of multiple people.'</p>

<p>Doudar's motive remains unknown. 'For all I know, Mr Doudar may have been motivated by one or more other purposes,' the judge said.</p>

<p>Hawi's wife, Carolina Gonzalez, sister Zeinab and parents Ahmad and Nahdi read statements at his sentencing hearing.</p>

<p>They gave 'very moving accounts of the loss and grief that has resulted from the taking of their loved one in the most horrendous of circumstances.'</p>
