<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea defender Ethan Ampadu is poised to join Sheffield United on loan. </p>

<p>The Wales international, 19, will become Chris Wilder's fourth signing of the week following Jayden Bogle and Max Lowe from Derby and West Brom winger Oliver Burke who will arrive in a swap with Callum Robinson.</p>

<p>Ampadu is at a crucial stage of his career where he needs to play more regular, competitive football and Wilder is willing to give him an opportunity at Bramall Lane. </p>

<p>Sheffield United are set to sign Chelsea defender Ethan Ampadu on loan for 2020-21</p>

<p>The 19-year-old defender impressed for Wales against Bulgaria in the Nations League </p>

<p>Chris Wilder wants to build another strong squad to improve on a stellar 2019-20 campaign</p>

<p>The versatile Ampadu was outstanding in central defence as Wales opened their Nations League campaign with a 1-0 win in Finland last Thursday.</p>

<p>But Ampadu, who also operates as a holding midfielder, has had to endure frustration at club level with limited game-time at Chelsea and Red Bull Leipzig, where he spent last season on loan.</p>

<p>Wales boss Ryan Giggs underlined he had spoken at length with Ampadu about his next move. </p>

<p>Ampadu is in need of first-team games, which he is unlikely to get amid Chelsea's revolution</p>

<p>He said: 'It's that balance over whether they're at a top club and surrounded by top players and improving every day, but ultimately you need minutes on the pitch. That's a decision for Ethan. I've talked to him a lot about that.</p>

<p>'I think last year was maybe a little bit different as he had injuries. You could see from the game he played against Tottenham in the Champions League he was outstanding.</p>

<p>'Nothing fazes him, he's a quality player, and he just needs to keep fit now.'</p>
