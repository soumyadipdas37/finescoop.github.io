<p>Bennett's victory meant he reclaimed the green jersey for the points classification</p>

<p>'Sorry - I don't mean to be a cry-baby,' he added, wiping away tears.</p>

<p>French health authorities and organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) have said that should two members of a team, riders or staff, test positive for coronavirus the whole outfit will be kicked out of the race.</p>

<p>The International Cycling Union (UCI) and the organisers said that one staff member each from French outfits Cofidis and AG2R-La Mondiale, Britain's Team Ineos-Grenadiers and Australia's Mitchelton-Scott contracted the virus.</p>

<p>On a route peppered with traffic islands and roundabouts, several crashes occurred, with France's Guillaume Martin, third overall, and one of the main contenders, Slovenian Tadej Pogacar, being involved in a pile-up 65km from the line.</p>

<p>They both made it back to the main bunch.</p>
