<p>Larynzo D. Johnson, 26, was charged with 14 counts of wanton endangerment and two counts of assault on a police officer</p>

<p>Some of the demonstrators chanted 'say her name, Breonna Taylor' and 'You can't stop the revolution.'</p>

<p>The stone Gothic-style church was built in the late 19th century and is known for its progressive ideology. A large Black Lives Matter banner hangs outside it. </p>

<p>Police withdrew after the clergy member advised them that the armed demonstrators had permission to be on church grounds. </p>

<p>Other video from Louisville shows roving bands of protesters out after curfew confronting a business owner whose small business was firebombed the previous night. Tonight, he stood guard outside with a long gun.</p>

<p>The exchange grew heated as the band of protesters berated the man, who responded: 'I don't care about white, black, green, purple, whatever the f*** it is.'</p>

<p>'I don't see color, I don't believe in color. I'm part Filipino,' the business owner added, video shows. </p>
