<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Phil Foden has now spoken out after being axed from the England senior squad for inviting girls into the team hotel in Iceland, along with Mason Greenwood.</p>

<p>The youth pair made arrangements with an Icelandic model and her friend to come to the official team hotel, which was under quarantine rules.</p>

<p>Foden and Greenwood have been ejected from the England squad as a result by manager Gareth Southgate, and now the Manchester City youngster has issued a statement via social media to apologise for his actions.</p>

<p>Phil Foden, pictured here on a snapchat taken by one of the young women invited to the England hotel, has apologised for his 'poor decision' after being axed from the senior squad </p>

<p>Foden took to social media on Monday evening to issue a full apology to everybody involved</p>

<p>Writing on Twitter on Monday evening, Foden said: 'Following the story which has emerged today regarding my actions in Iceland, I want to make a full apology.</p>

<p>'I apologise to Gareth Southgate, to my England team mate, to the staff, supporters, and also to my Club and family.</p>

<p>'I am a young player with a lot to learn, but I am aware of the huge responsibility I have in representing Manchester City and England at this level.</p>

<p>One of the women was videoed while on the phone to Foden and Greenwood, making plans</p>

<p>'On this occasion I made a poor decision and my behaviour didn't meet the standards expected of me.</p>

<p>'I breached COVID-19 protocols put in place to protect myself and my England colleagues. As a consequence I will now miss the opportunity to travel to Denmark with the squad, and that hurts.' </p>

<p>It is understood that Foden is now concerned about how this event will affect his England status long-term, along with his standing in the City senior team. </p>

<p>After the story came to light, footage soon emerged online via social media of the girls speaking on the phone with the England players, arranging to meet.</p>

<p>In the video the Icelandic girls, one of whom is 20-year-old model Nadia Sif Lindal Gunnarsdottir, ask how the stars are going to sneak them into the hotel.</p>

<p>At the other end of the line, Foden could be heard responding: 'What you coming to the hotel for?', before Greenwood appears to say to his team-mate in the background: 'what do you think?'</p>

<p>Later footage then shows the footballers with the model and her cousin and best friend Lara Clausen, a 19-year-old law student. </p>

<p>England U23 boss Aidy Boothroyd has also had his say on the matter, telling Sportsmail: ‘I’m surprised and disappointed. Young people can be naïve but without knowing all the facts it’d be difficult for me to go into any detail.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been banging on about stretching talent and that’s what I believe in. Good players need to be progressed. This incident isn’t anything to do with the playing side of things.'</p>

<p>Boothroyd went on to outline how conversations would now be had within the junior England ranks - which Foden and Greenwood had graduated from - in order to warn players against these kind of reckless actions. </p>

<p>‘We’ll be having a conversation about it with the leadership team (Ben Godfrey, Tom Davies, Eddie Nketiah) tonight and then with the rest of the lads as well.'</p>

<p>Icelandic police have now fined both Foden and Greenwood 250,000 Icelandic Krona (£1,300) for the rule breach during the coronavirus pandemic, which must be paid by the individuals themselves and not by the FA or their clubs.</p>
