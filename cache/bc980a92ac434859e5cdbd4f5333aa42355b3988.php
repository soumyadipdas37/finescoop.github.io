<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A London teenager who disappeared in a Malaysian jungle was not sexually assaulted before her death, an inquest has been told.</p>

<p>Nora Quoirin's naked body was discovered in a stream at the bottom of a rocky slope last summer and had been dead for four days before rescuers found her.</p>

<p>A sexual assault was today ruled out by a forensic expert, with a post-mortem ruling the 15-year-old had died from internal bleeding in her intestine, through stress and starvation, the Mirror reports.</p>

<p>Nora Quoirin (pictured) was not sexually assaulted prior to her death, an inquest has heard </p>

<p>Nora vanished from the Dusun rainforest resort, around 45 miles from Kuala Lumpur, where she had been staying with her parents and siblings on August 3 last year.</p>

<p>A huge rescue operation was launched involving more than 350 searchers, including volunteers, sniffer dogs and a shaman before she was found dead ten days later. </p>

<p>Noor Aidora Saedon, head of forensics, told the coroner today the schoolgirl had died four days before her body was discovered by hikers. </p>

<p>An autopsy took place less than an hour after her body was airlifted from the water, the inquest heard. </p>

<p>Last week, the court was told how the girl was approached by a stranger at Kuala Lumpur International Airport.</p>

<p>Father Sebastien had left Nora, who had learning difficulties, with her two younger siblings - aged 12 and eight - for less then five minutes while he went to meet his wife, Meabh, who was flying in separately, at the arrival gate.</p>

<p>A female police office told the inquest that as Sebastien walked away, despite only taking around 30 steps, the siblings were approached by an unknown male.</p>

<p>Police believe Nora simply wandered off and that there is no 'criminal element' involved.</p>

<p>Officers say she was able to leave the resort by herself by getting out of a window which had a faulty latch. </p>

<p>Parents Meabh and Sebastien (pictured calling for their daughter with a megaphone last year) demanded an inquest after arguing their daughter would not have wandered off</p>

<p>DNA analysis established no evidence of penetration prior to her death. </p>

<p>The expert told the court: 'The body may have been exposed to the elements, differing night-and-day temperatures, partially submerged in a flowing stream... these are conditions which are also taken into consideration when analysing samples and preparing the report.</p>

<p>'There was no foreign matter lifted or found on the outside of the body to indicate a foreign DNA.</p>

<p>'In short, we have done the analysis as thoroughly as I could and we could not find any foreign DNA on the body.'</p>

<p>The hearing continues.</p>
