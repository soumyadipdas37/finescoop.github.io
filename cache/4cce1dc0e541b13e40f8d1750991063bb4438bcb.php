<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A rematch between Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz is in the pipeline, revealed UFC president Dana White. </p>

<p>A medical stoppage due to nasty cuts around Diaz's eye forced a stoppage and led to Masvidal winning the BMF belt in their highly-anticipated first encounter. </p>

<p>'Gambred' has since gone on to lose in his title shot against Kamaru Usman on short notice, meaning now is an opportune time for himself and Diaz to run it back. </p>

<p>Jorge Masvidal (left) could rematch Nate Diaz (right) towards the end of this year </p>

<p>Diaz suffered cuts in the first fight and they were nasty enough to force a medical stoppage</p>

<p>Dana White told ESPN: ''It's being worked on. That fight is in the works.</p>

<p>'[Masvidal] wants to defend [the BMF belt] against Diaz. They were the first two to fight for it, so he wants to put it up versus Nate again.'</p>

<p>It is understood that the rematch is being targeted for UFC 256 on December 12 later this year.  </p>

<p>It was a memorable but frustrating first meeting between Masvidal and Diaz at UFC 244 in Madison Square Garden last November. </p>

<p>Masvidal was crowned the BMF champion and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson awarded the belt </p>

<p>Dana White confirmed that the UFC are currently working on setting up the rematch </p>

<p>Ringside doctors called a stop to the contest given the severity of Diaz's cuts despite the Stockton fighter's protestations. </p>

<p>Masivdal had been dominating the contest up until that point but many believed Diaz would enjoy his strongest rounds later on when his superb cardio comes to the fore. </p>

<p>Diaz, 35, has not stepped into the octagon since that defeat having fought twice in 2019, a victory against Anthony Pettis before the Masvidal TKO.  </p>
