<p>Haunted: The nine-episode supernatural series - set in 1987 England - centers on American governess Dani Clayton (Victoria Pedretti), who's hired to tutor and care for orphaned children Miles &amp; Flora Wingrave in a remote country house</p>

<p>After leaving and turning out the lights, one of the dolls lifted its head.</p>

<p>Later, 11-year-old Flora (Amelie Bea Smith) sings a lullaby as a blurred figure behind her gasps for breath with bones cracking like a contortionist.</p>

<p>Unbothered, little Flora hushes the ghost.</p>

<p>'Dolls, for children, are a way to play with representations of real people,' Flanagan explained to Vanity Fair last week. </p>

<p>'Dolls, for children, are a way to play with representations of real people': Unbothered, little Flora hushes the ghost</p>

<p>'I think for kids, it's about control. Kids have such little agency. Dolls provide that. But there's also a darker side to it. Ownership, claiming someone, ceasing to look at them as a human, and instead, looking at them as an object, as a doll.'</p>

<p>The Massachusetts-born 42-year-old cryptically added: 'The more attention a viewer focuses on Flora's dollhouse, the more they're likely to see what's happening and why.'</p>

<p>The teaser also reveals a female ghost rising from a pond in the ensemble drama loosely based on Henry James' 1898 horror novella, The Turn of the Screw.</p>

<p>E.T. alum Henry Thomas portrays the children's emotionally-distant uncle Henry Wingrave and there's also chef Owen (Rahul Kohli), groundskeeper Jamie (Amelia Eve), and housekeeper Mrs. Grose (T'Nia Miller) populating the estate.   </p>
