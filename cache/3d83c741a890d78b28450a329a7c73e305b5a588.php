<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Savers are being urged to grab a fixed-rate deal before they disappear.</p>

<p>One-year fixed savings rates have crept up above 1 per cent in recent weeks, with new banks leap-frogging each other to sit at the top of the best buy tables.</p>

<p>Competition has improved slightly because savers know they can earn 1.15 per cent with the Government's own saving arm.</p>

<p>One-year fixed savings rates have crept up above 1% in recent weeks, but those top rates could disappear quite quickly</p>

<p>However, experts advise savers to move quickly as these deals may not last if National Savings &amp; Investments (NS&amp;I) cuts its rates.</p>

<p>Savers piled £45 billion into easy-access accounts in just four months over lockdown, while the amount in fixed-rate bonds fell by £3.5 billion.</p>

<p>But demand for fixed bonds is now soaring again, according to Hargreaves Lansdown and the Savings Champion website.</p>

<p>Rates on fixed-rate bonds tumbled when the Bank of England base rate fell from 0.75 per cent to 0.1 per cent in March because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Yet with inflation now at 1 per cent, many will at least guard your savings from the eroding effects of the rising cost of living.</p>

<p>There are 77 fixed deals that match or beat inflation, compared to just three easy-access deals, according to Moneyfacts.</p>

<p>James Blower, founder of Savings Guru, says: 'If you are happy to tie your money up, get a fixed-rate bond now.</p>

<p>'But don't go for more than one year as the extra interest you earn for tying your money up for longer is not worth it.'</p>

<p>Often you earn just 0.1 per cent more if you tie your money up for two years rather than one year — worth just £10 on each £10,000.</p>

<p>NS&amp;I's easy access Direct Saver and Income Bonds pay 1 per cent and 1.15 per cent respectively.</p>

<p>It also has a range of fixed-rate bonds available to existing customers, with a one-year deal paying a near-top 1.1 per cent.</p>

<p>In July, NS&amp;I upped the amount it wants to bring in from savers to £35 billion from a previous £6 billion to help finance its Covid-19 expenditure and support savers.</p>

<p>At the start of the financial year from April to June, it attracted a huge £14.5 billion. That could rise to nearly £30 billion by the end of this month if it repeats the performance.</p>

<p>NS&amp;I will then have to choose between cutting its rates or raising its target figure.</p>

<p>The Government bank has to give savers two months' warning that their rate is falling. So if it's the former, the announcement could come in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Top rates do not last long because new banks are not looking to bring in vast sums.</p>

<p>Oaknorth's one-year bond at 1.21 per cent, Charter Savings Bank's 1.22 per cent, along with Secure Trust's 1.16 per cent, were on sale for just over a week.</p>

<p>Best rates on one-year fixed-rate bonds now include Paragon Bank and United Trust Bank at 1.2 per cent and Allica Bank at 1.16 per cent.</p>

<p>Don't bother with the big banks — they are paying as little as 0.2 per cent fixed for a year.</p>
