<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Some CEOs at cash-scrapped Australian companies are still raking in millions of dollars in bonuses despite laying off workers and claiming JobKeeper payments.</p>

<p>Labor Party assistant treasurer Dr Andrew Leigh says it's 'disgusting' that taxpayer money is being spent to top up the pay packets of executives during a time of economic crisis.</p>

<p>The $1500 per fortnight JobKeeper program was brought in during April to cushion the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>IDP Education CEO Andrew Barkla (right) was gifted a $683,000 bonus despite already earning over 400 times the average wage at $37million per year. Accent Group CEO Daniel Agostinelli (left) received $1.2million bonus</p>

<p>IDP Education - CEO Andrew Barkla - $683,000 bonus</p>

<p>Accent Group - CEO Daniel Agostinelli - $1.2 million bonus</p>

<p>Star Entertainment Group - CEO Matt Bekier - $800,000 share bonus</p>

<p>Nick Scali - Scali family - $2million in dividends</p>

<p>1300 Smiles - Managing Director Daryl Holmes - $2million in dividends</p>

<p>SeaLink Travel Group - CEO Clinton Feuerherdt - $504,000 in short-term bonuses</p>

<p>Qantas - CEO Alan Joyce - No bonus and a 65 percent reduction in salary to November</p>

<p>Australia Post - CEO Christine Holgate - No annual bonus</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Under the plan, companies with a downturn of 30 percent, or 50 percent for organisations with turnover of more than $1billion, can receive a government handout to pay their workers.</p>

<p>'Recessions hit the poor hardest which is why Australia followed many countries around the world in implementing a wage subsidy scheme,' Dr Leigh told a parliamentary hearing.</p>

<p>'But the scheme designed to reduce inequality is being misused by a small number of firms who are channeling it to executive bonuses.'</p>

<p>Australia's highest-earning CEO, Andrew Barkla, who heads up IDP Education, was gifted a $683,000 bonus despite already earning over 400 times the average wage at $37million per year.</p>

<p>The company claimed $4.4million in Jobkeeper subsidies. </p>

<p>Footwear giant Accent Group received $13 million for JobKeeper payments, but still gave CEO Daniel Agostinelli a $1.2 million bonus. </p>

<p>Qantas received $267million in JobKeepr payments. CEO Alan Joyce (pictured) and other senior executives took no pay in April, May and June</p>

<p>Matt Barkier, the CEO of Star Entertainment Group, elected to cut his earnings from $1.7million to $1.5million as the gaming juggernaut raked in $64 million from the government.</p>

<p>But although his pay dropped slightly, Mr Barkier was given an $800,000 share bonus, redeemable after 12 months.</p>

<p>At the peak of the coronavirus shutdown Star Entertainment Group stood down 90 per cent of their 9000-strong workforce.</p>

<p>According to the Courier Mail, Mr Bekier's equity bonus was given for achieving the company's 'strategic goals'.</p>

<p>Dr Leigh said there are a number of companies treating JobKeeper like 'DividendKeeper' by diverting money for workers into shareholder payouts.</p>

<p>'Furniture firm Nick Scali received $4million from Australian and New Zealand taxpayers. Its increased dividend will deliver $2million to the Scali family,' he said.</p>

<p>'1300 Smiles got $2 million in JobKeeper and paid out $3million to shareholders. Managing director Daryl Holmes owns two-thirds of the company, so will get about $2million - roughly what his company received in JobKeeper support.'</p>

<p>Dental firm 1300 Smiles got $2million in JobKeeper and paid out $3million to shareholders (managing director Daryl Homes right)</p>

<p>The Dental firm told Daily Mail Australia they 'strongly object' to the way the company has been characterised.</p>

<p>'The dividend in question relates to the company's financial performance to June 2020,' 1300 Smiles said.</p>

<p>'Despite the pandemic's impacts during March, April and May, during government imposed restrictions, the company delivered a strong financial performance and growth under Dr. Holmes' leadership.</p>

<p>'The company has financial obligations to its shareholders, which include many self-funded retirees and mum and dad shareholders who depend on dividend income.</p>

<p>North Stradbroke Island-focused tourism operator SeaLink Travel Group paid shareholders $18.9million in dividends after taking in $8.6million in JobKeeper payments.</p>

<p>SeaLink's CEO Clinton Feuerherdt received $504,000 in short-term bonuses.</p>

<p>With pressure mounting in the community over CEO salaries, Australia Post backtracked on their lavish remuneration plan.</p>

<p>Australia Post was going to hand out $7million to executives but then scrapped the move following yesterday's GDP figures which revealed Australia has now entered a recession for the first time in three decades with a quarterly decline of 7 percent.</p>

<p>'The Australia Post board determined that no short-term incentive payment would be made to the executive team for financial year 2020,' chairman Lucio Di Bartolomeo said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Australia Post CEO Christine Holgate appears before a Senate inquiry into changes at Australia Post at Parliament House in Canberra, Wednesday, July 8, 2020</p>

<p>Australia Post was going to hand out $7million to executives but then scrapped the move following yesterday's GDP figures which revealed Australia has now entered a recession for the first time in three decades with a quarterly decline of 7 percent.</p>

<p>'I have every confidence in the executive team and their commitment to excellent performance in the year ahead.'</p>

<p>Australia Post are not eligible for JobKeeper payments as a government business enterprise.</p>

<p>The national carrier Qantas has been one of the Australia's largest recipients of JobKeeper.</p>

<p>Qantas received $267million in payments along with another $190million in taxpayer money to repatriate Australians stuck in coronavirus hotspots.</p>

<p>The airline has sacked 6000 workers and stood down a further 20,000.</p>

<p>In response, CEO Alan Joyce and other senior executives took no pay in April, May and June and no annual bonuses will be paid.</p>

<p>At the moment 'executives are currently on reduced pay (65 per cent of $2.015million for the CEO and 85 per cent for other executives) until November 2020.'</p>
