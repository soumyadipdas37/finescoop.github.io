<p>Just last Sunday the former Vice President was pictured at the very same church where he attended Sunday mass and visited his loved ones' graves buried nearby. </p>

<p>His son Beau Biden, late wife Neilia and their daughter Naomi are buried there. </p>

<p>However, Biden was mocked by Francis Brennan, Trump's campaign director of strategic response, for not speaking to media during the emotional visit.</p>

<p>Brennan tweeted video of of Biden walking through the cemetery. </p>

<p>A reporter is heard saying: 'Mr. Vice President come talk to us!' and Biden responds with a wave before walking to his waiting SUV after church services.  </p>

<p>Grandchildren of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden, including Finnegan Biden, Hunter Biden, Natalie Biden, Naomi Biden and Maisy Biden, lead the Pledge of Allegiance during the first night of the Democratic National Convention</p>

<p>Brennan sarcastically captioned the video: 'Joe Biden just keeps meandering along.'</p>

<p>In reality Biden had waved and smiled at reporters gathered at the church but didn't stop for comments as he paid a visit to his loved ones' resting places.  </p>

<p>Brennan was heavily criticized on social media for the insensitive comment.  </p>

<p>Francis Brennan, Trump's campaign director of strategic response, mocked Joe Biden on Twitter on Sunday as he left church, walking through the cemetery where his loved ones are buried. He said that 'Joe Biden just keeps meandering along' when reporters asked to speak with him. Biden politely waved to reporters in the clip</p>
