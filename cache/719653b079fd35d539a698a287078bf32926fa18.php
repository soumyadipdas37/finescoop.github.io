<p>Justin recently debuted the wholesome music video for his new song Holy featuring Chance The Rapper, which references his whirlwind romance with Hailey.</p>

<p>'Running to the altar like a track star / Can't wait another second / 'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me / Feels so holy,' Bieber sang.</p>

<p>'They say we're too young and / The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin" / Wise men say fools rush in / But I don't know.'</p>
