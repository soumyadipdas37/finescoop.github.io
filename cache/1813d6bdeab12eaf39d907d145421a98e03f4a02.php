<p>Kenneth Branagh is shooting a semi-autobiographical film inspired by his early childhood growing up in Northern Ireland surrounded by a large extended family. And I can reveal that Judi Dench will portray his grandmother.</p>

<p>Jude Hill has been chosen to play the young boy based on Branagh during his early years in Belfast amid the tumult of the late-1960s. </p>

<p>The film is not a straightforward biography of Branagh’s childhood, so at present Hill’s character isn’t called Kenneth. It is an ensemble piece.</p>

<p>The movie, called Belfast (the actor was born in the north of the city), has started shooting, quietly, on locations in England; though there are plans for some scenes to be filmed in his home town.</p>

<p>Branagh has often spoken of the city that ‘shaped’ him, recalling how his parents, Frances and William, were related to half of Belfast ‘and I went to school with the other half’.</p>

<p>He visited his grandparents twice a week and, at the age of nine, felt the wrench when his dad, a joiner, and mum, who worked in a chip shop, moved to Reading, Berkshire, to escape The Troubles.</p>

<p>The award-winning director described the film, in the Belfast Telegraph, as a ‘very personal movie about a place and people I love’. </p>

<p>His Death On The Nile, in which he stars as Hercule Poirot — and also directs — is due for release this autumn.</p>
