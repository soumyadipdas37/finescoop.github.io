<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Atletico Madrid have rejected a £46million offer from Juventus for the former Chelsea striker, Alvaro Morata. </p>

<p>The offer was tabled by Juve coach Andrea Pirlo, who played alongside Morata during their 2014-15 spell in Turin. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old has been linked with a move away from Madrid after growing frustrated with Diego Simeone's decision to play Diego Costa ahead of him on several occasions at the end of last season. </p>

<p>Atletico Madrid have rejected a £46million offer from Juventus for striker Alvaro Morata</p>

<p>Morata – whose wife is also Italian – is interested in returning to Juventus, having had a highly successful two-year spell at the Bianconeri after he joined from Real Madrid for £15.8m in 2014.</p>

<p>The loan deal was worth £6.5m in January 2019 and had an obligation to buy for a further £51m in July 2020. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old has nothing but good memories from his time at the club, where he scored 27 goals in 93 appearances.</p>

<p>Morata wants to leave Atleti as Diego Simeone decided to play Diego Costa ahead of him</p>

<p>During a loan spell at Juventus, Morata scored 27 goals and helped win two Serie A titles</p>

<p>Morata even helped Juventus win two Serie A titles and progress into the Champions League final, where they suffered a 3-1 defeat to Barcelona in 2015. </p>

<p>Despite his good relationship with the Italian club, Atleti are reluctant to sell the forward after forking out £58m to purchase him from Chelsea. </p>

<p>As Morata's contract in Madrid runs until 2023, the club have told Juventus to either activate his £137 release clause or up their opening offer, according to Marca.   </p>

<p>Should Juventus eventually sign Morata permanently, it would mean that Pirlo would reunite with the Spaniard who was part of the team during the Italian's final year as a player at the club. </p>
