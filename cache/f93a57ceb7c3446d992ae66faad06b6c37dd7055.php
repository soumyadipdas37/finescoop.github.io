<p>But one follower corrected Paul, writing back: 'You'll also lose followers when you don't know that "yours" doesn't require an apostrophe'. </p>

<p>'Paul, I think you're lovely. people are only nasty when they're insanely jealous. it's a reflection on who they are,' another follower typed. </p>

<p>Throwing his hands up in the air with delight, the quiz player took advantage of the hottest day of the year as he picked up the hobby during the UK's coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>In June last year, the comedian revealed he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, vowing to 'fight with every breath I have'.</p>

<p>Expanding further in an impassioned blog post, the funnyman said he was initially 'in shock', but 'feels far more prepared for the new challenges ahead' now he has a treatment plan in place.</p>

<p>Displaying he trademark humour, the TV star also joked that a Dancing On Ice appearance is now 'out of the question', before thanking his family and fiancé for their support in the wake of his diagnosis. </p>

<p>Paul - who has has been a chaser on the popular quiz show since 2011 - admitted it has 'been a really, really tough two weeks' since he got the diagnosis but now he has a treatment plan in place he feels 'prepared for the new challenges ahead'.</p>

<p>The joy of his life: In the romance department, Paul tied the knot to his long-term partner Olly in front of 38 guests last winter </p>

<p>On the evening of Thursday May 30th, an experienced consultant neurologist calmly informed me that I had Parkinson’s disease. </p>

<p>It was a devastating denouement to a medical odyssey that began in September 2017 with a sudden-onset, frozen right shoulder, and took in an unexpected diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, a lifestyle transformation that enabled me to lose two stone, and a shoulder operation in January this year. </p>

<p>Nonetheless my reaction was not one of shock. I spent May this year in New Zealand simultaneously having the comedy month of my life, and worrying about why a right-sided limp was now getting worse. </p>

<p>Behind the facade of the cheerful, late night comedy festival drunk was a man deeply scared about facing the truth when back in the UK. It has been a really, really tough two weeks. </p>

<p>Cancelling my run at the Edinburgh Fringe, missing the World Quizzing Championships to have brain scans, performing club sets whilst emotionally bewildered, and of course working my way through my loved ones, delivering the bad news. </p>

<p>With the diagnosis now confirmed, and a treatment plan in place, I now feel far more prepared for the new challenges ahead. </p>

<p>I have an amazing family, no strangers to serious medical illness, I’m blessed to have a fiancé who is there for me, and I have a multitude of friends and colleagues whom I consider to be exceptional human beings. </p>

<p>I don’t consider myself unlucky, and whatever the next stage of my life holds for me, many others have it far worse. </p>

<p>In the time since my Parkinson’s started I have been ludicrously busy, and fully intend to keep Chasing, keep writing and performing comedy, keep quizzing and keep being hopeless at Tasks. </p>

<p>Dancing on Ice is, I suspect, out of the question. A lot of people have asked “What can I do to help ?” The answer is to treat me exactly the same as before. Much love, Paul</p>
