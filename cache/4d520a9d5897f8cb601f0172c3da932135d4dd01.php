<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A vile sex attacker who violently raped an 80-year-old woman in her own home has been locked up for eight years.</p>

<p>John Laming struck last Christmas Eve just 12 days after he had been freed from jail. The terrified victim yelled for help, but when no one heard, Laming taunted her: 'Some neighbours you have got.'</p>

<p>The 32-year-old then sat swigging a can of juice after the attack and claimed the OAP was 'strong like his granny'.</p>

<p>Laming fled, but was soon snared for the crime in Rutherglen, near Glasgow.</p>

<p>He was today sentenced having earlier pled guilty to a charge of assault and rape.</p>

<p>John LamingÂ was today sentenced having earlier pled guilty to a charge of assault and rape</p>

<p>Lady Stacey said she had decided against imposing an Order for Lifelong Restriction.</p>

<p>But, she told Laming: 'What you did was a terrible crime. You should be completely ashamed.</p>

<p>'It must have been extremely frightening for the woman involved. She was in her own home minding her own business.'</p>

<p>The former heating engineer will also be supervised for a further four years on his release.</p>

<p>The High Court in Glasgow heard how Laming already had a criminal past including a four year prison term for robbery in 2015.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Kath Harper said he was released from jail last December 12.</p>

<p>The victim was in bed when she was awoken by smashing glass around midnight on Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>She got up and was confronted by Laming, who lived in Rutherglen, but was not known to her.</p>

<p>The OAP ordered him out before bravely tackling him.</p>

<p>Laming fled from the scene, but was soon snared for the crime in Rutherglen, near Glasgow (pictured)</p>

<p>Miss Harper: 'She reached for a metal pole used to open her window. She tried to hit him with it.'</p>

<p>The woman also pressed her panic alarm, but it failed to work.</p>

<p>The prosecutor: 'She was also screaming. Laming said 'some neighbours you have got' when no one heard.'</p>

<p>The victim ended up on her bed with Laming leaning over her.</p>

<p>She pleaded: 'What are you doing this to an 80 year-old lady for?'</p>

<p>Laming branded her a 'w***e' before going on to rape her in the dining room.</p>

<p>After the attack, Laming helped the terrified woman onto a chair and told her to make a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Miss Harper: 'He said she was 'strong like his granny'. He asked if she had any alcohol.</p>

<p>'The woman told him she did not, but there was some juice.</p>

<p>'He took a can and told her she had a much nicer house than him.'</p>

<p>Laming left after clearing up broken glass - but returned to ask for his vape e-cigarette which he had dropped.</p>

<p>The victim called her daughter to say a man had 'kicked her door in'.</p>

<p>Police also arrived before the distressed pensioner was taken to hospital.</p>

<p>As she was being examined, she burst into tears and told a medic: 'I fought back.'</p>

<p>Her injuries included 'multiple' bruises on her neck and body.</p>

<p>Laming was snared near the house he shared with his mum late on Christmas Eve hiding in a garden.</p>

<p>His lawyer Ann Ogg said: 'He did not think he was capable of such behaviour.'</p>

<p>Laming was also placed on the sex offenders list.</p>
