<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rio Ferdinand has criticised Manchester United's lack of transfer activity so far this summer, insisting Chelsea's huge outlay shows there is no excuse for failing to bring in quality players.</p>

<p>United have so far only signed Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40million but have been left frustrated in their attempts to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. </p>

<p>Premier League rivals Chelsea, however, have spent more than £200m on six new signings, including Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen and Timo Werner from RB Leipzig to fire them into title contention.</p>

<p>Rio Ferdinand has criticised Manchester United's lack of transfer activity so far this summer</p>

<p>United have so far only signed Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40m in this window so far</p>

<p>Ed Woodward has so far failed to strengthen Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad sufficiently</p>

<p>Ferdinand believes Frank Lampard's huge outlay shows there are deals to be done this summer and his former club need to act quickly to strengthen their squad before the window slams shut on October 5. </p>

<p>'Frank (Lampard) has made signing players like it's the norm, like it's easy – water off a duck's back,' Ferdinand said during an appearance on the Five YouTube Channel.</p>

<p>'The difference in the way Chelsea have done their business compared to say my team Man United… there is no noise there's nothing going on, all you're seeing is bang – deal.</p>

<p>'Little bit of talk, bang-deal.</p>

<p>'That is what's frustrating for me and all the Man United fans.' </p>

<p>Ferdinand pointed out Sancho as the prime example of United's dithering in the transfer market.</p>

<p>Premier League rivals Chelsea have spent over £200m on six players, including Kai Havertz</p>

<p>United are still in the hunt to sign Jadon Sancho but Borussia Dortmund are playing hardball</p>

<p>United failed to meet an August deadline set by the England international's club Borussia Dortmund to get a deal done.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old remains United's No 1 target but they have been at loggerheads with Dortmund over their £108m valuation for the forward.</p>

<p>Ferdinand described their pursuit of Sancho as 'frustrating' and called for Ed Woodward and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to simply pay up in order to bolster their squad. </p>

<p>'Sancho was talked about months ago,' said Ferdinand.</p>

<p>'Still not done, it's so frustrating, I'm not saying deals are easy to be done but Chelsea are showing deals can be done if you put the money down and it's all done in the right way.' </p>

<p>United start their Premier League campaign at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday after being given an extended period of rest following their run in the Europa League. </p>
