<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>China has emerged as a potential opponent to the American takeover of British chip maker Arm.</p>

<p>The Global Times newspaper – seen as a mouthpiece for Beijing's Communist regime – said Nvidia's £30billion purchase of the firm from Softbank was 'disturbing' and urged regulators to treat it with caution.</p>

<p>It claimed that Arm could be 'politicised as a technology weapon' in the US-China trade war, leaving Chinese firms such as telecoms giant Huawei blocked from buying its chips.</p>

<p>Chip deal: The Global Times newspaper - seen as a mouthpiece for China's Communist regime - said Nvidia's purchase of Arm was 'disturbing' and urged regulators to treat it with caution</p>

<p>And Zhu Jing, the vice-chairman of Chinese industry body the Beijing Semiconductor Association, said: 'If Arm is acquired by a US company, everyone will be worried.'</p>

<p>The comments are significant because the deal needs approval from Chinese regulators, among others, before it can go ahead.</p>

<p>The American giant swooping on Arm previously laid off hundreds of staff at another British company.</p>

<p>Nvidia paid £283million for Bristol-based Icera, a top microchip firm making chips for smartphones and internet dongles, in 2011.</p>

<p>Four years later Nvidia shuttered the firm and laid off 500 staff, in a strategy overhaul to focus on areas such as gaming, automotive vehicles and cloud computing. It later blamed alleged anti-competitive practices from rival Qualcomm.</p>

<p>Nvidia's rivals, including Qualcomm, say its Arm takeover may put it in an overly dominant position itself.  </p>

<p>They come after British MPs, trade unionists and Arm's co-founders raised concerns about the takeover, with critics claiming it could threaten jobs and give US firm Nvidia a too-dominant position in the microchip industry.</p>

<p>Cambridge-based Arm's chip designs are used by 70 per cent of the world's population, powering everything from smartphones to computers and games consoles.</p>

<p>Nvidia insists Arm will remain in the UK, jobs will be protected and it will maintain its 'neutral' approach to selling technology around the world.</p>

<p>The Global Times said: 'If Arm falls into US hands, Chinese companies would be placed at a big disadvantage. </p>

<p>'Not just Huawei, all could be cut off from Arm-based chips.'</p>

<p>It said Huawei – already hit by US sanctions over links to Beijing – could be barred from buying Arm chips if the deal is done.</p>

<p> Huawei, a big Arm customer, did not comment.</p>
