<p>WHAT A STATEMENT ðŸ™ŒIsrael Adesanya ends the rivalry with Paulo Costa inside two rounds with a dominant display!It was THAT easy ðŸ˜³ #UFC253 pic.twitter.com/jxdchos1zf</p>

<p>Adesanya methodically attacked Costa's legs in the opening round, with 20 kicks landed in a bid to slow the devastatingly powerful Brazilian.Â </p>

<p>Costa, 29, attempted to goad the champion into making it an all-out brawl, but Adesanya remained composed, opting to pick his shots and bide his time before landing the knockout blow.Â </p>

<p>And it did not take long. The Nigerian-born New Zealander chose to pounce in the second round, with a big left hook knocking Costa to the canvas, with a flurry of ground and pound strikes enough to persuade refereeÂ Jason Herzog to stop the contest.</p>

<p>But it was as one-sided as it gets with Adesanya finishing his middleweight rival in the second</p>

<p>An animated Adesanya said he was looking to cement his legacy among the middleweights</p>

<p>The charismatic middleweight appeared to 'hump' Costa moments after Herzog waved off the contest, and started break-dancing just feet away from his rival while doctors were attending to him.Â </p>

<p>'You all must have forgot. I have to make you remember, we're the best,' Adesanya, who extended his undefeated record to 20 wins, exclaimed in his post-fight interview.Â </p>

<p>The 31-year-old set out plans to run through the middleweight division, and in doing so form a legacy to rival that of UFC icon Anderson Silva.Â </p>

<p>'Anderson Silva lived a great legacy and I want to do service to the middleweight division,' he added. 'Jared Cannonier, I love his energy, he's a beautiful man. I said, "You destroy Robert Whittaker, you're next."'Â </p>

<p>Meanwhile, 37-year-old Jan Blachowicz became the new light-heavyweight championÂ </p>

<p>The Pole knocked out Dominick Reyes to claim the belt that Jon Jones had vacated this year</p>

<p>Meanwhile in the co-main event, Poland's Jan Blachowicz won his first UFC title at 37 years old by defeating Dominick Reyes to claim Jon Jones's vacated light heavyweight championship.</p>

<p>Blachowicz primarily controlled the action in the first round before catching Reyes with a sudden left hook late in the second round.</p>

<p>The punch caused Reyes to stumble and Blachowicz immediately took advantage, pouncing on the American and quickly finishing him on the ground.Â </p>

<p>In the event's other results, Brandon Royval earned a second-round submission victory over Kai Kara-France, Ketlen Vieira claimed a decision win over Sijara Eubanks in the women's bantamweight division and Hakeem Duwodu eked out a decision victory against Zubhaira Tukhugov to improve his record to 12-1-1.</p>
