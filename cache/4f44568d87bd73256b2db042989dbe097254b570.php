<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dana White is open to the idea of a seismic heavyweight showdown between Jon Jones and Brock Lesnar. </p>

<p>Jones is moving up to heavyweight to take on champion Stipe Miocic but also recently called out Lesnar, a pay-per-view fan favourite and former WWE entertainer. </p>

<p>'Bones' wrote on Twitter: 'Brock I'll beatcho a** too', and White threw his weight behind the idea. </p>

<p>Jon Jones called out Brock Lesnar and Dana White is open to making the fight happen </p>

<p>Lesnar last fought in 2016 and his win was made a no contest after a failed drugs test</p>

<p>The UFC president said: 'If [Jones and Lesnar] both want to fight each other, I'm sure it's a fight the fans want to see and it would be a good introduction for Jones into the heavyweight division.</p>

<p>'So, yeah if they both wanted to do it, I would do it.' </p>

<p>Lesnar, 43, had his last MMA fight against Mark Hunt at UFC 200 in October 2016.</p>

<p>The former heavyweight champion's win was later overturned to a no-contest after he tested positive for performance enhancing drugs.</p>

<p>Despite his best years being behind him, fans would no doubt love to see Lesnar face the man many regard as the greatest of all time. </p>

<p>White thinks a meeting with Lesnar would be a great way for Jones to start at heavyweight</p>

<p>Lesnar, 43, brings in huge pay-per-view numbers and remains a big name in the sport </p>

<p>Jones has dominated the light-heavyweight division and after seeing Miocic beat long-time rival Daniel Cormier in their trilogy bout last month, is intent on moving up a weight class. </p>

<p>Jones only has one blotch on his otherwise perfect copybook but that was a disqualification for illegal elbows rather than legitimate defeat. </p>

<p>Lesnar meanwhile told White he'd retired from MMA back in 2019 but is understood to have always wanted the mega-fight with Jones so may yet reverse his decision. </p>

<p>Francis Ngannou is front-runner to take on Miocic next, which may create an opportunity for Jones to take on Lesnar in the interim. </p>
