<p>Her blonde hair was worn both down and pulled back as she added tinted round sunglasses that read Maison Del' Amour and dainty gold jewelry.</p>

<p>The screen star has been in Croatia, Dubrovnik.</p>

<p>This comes just after Quinn told The Sunday Times that she has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on Selling Sunset.</p>

<p>Guess girl: For her new images shared to social media, the star was seen on vacation in a red hot swimsuit by Guess</p>

<p>The siren said: 'People that don’t know me say hurtful things. I’m just like, "Ugh, whatever." I don’t know these people. </p>

<p>'But when I hear stuff from other people… That’s upsetting. Sometimes, it hurts my feelings. Sometimes, it makes me cry.'</p>

<p>Although she's as vulnerable as the next person, she clarified that she has no intention of toning down her villainous persona.</p>

<p>Bad feelings: This comes just after Quinn told The Sunday Times that she has shed a tear or two over 'hurtful' trolls reacting to her role on Selling Sunset; seen earlier this year</p>

<p>Quinn said: 'That’s what people love about me. But obviously there are different sides to me. On the show, it’s one note. But I’m a multifaceted villain.</p>

<p>She added: 'I don’t feel like [b****] is a bad word. I embrace it. It stands for someone who knows what they want and speaks their mind. So many people don’t. If I get labelled a b**** because I speak my mind, then yeah, I guess I’m a b****.”   </p>

<p>The Shark Night actress has also opened up about how the show has affected her depression and anxiety.</p>

<p>Wedding bells: Christine and Christian wed in December in downtown Los Angeles as her cast mates, friends and family looked on. She wore black</p>

<p>She said this week on the podcast Too Tired to Be Crazy: 'It’s something that I’ve always had, and I feel like people who are really creative especially struggle with this balance.'</p>

<p>Quinn also revealed that she's taken Lexapro to treat it at different points in her life, taking it daily after season one premiered on Netflix.</p>

<p>She added: 'I know I’ve always had it, but the show definitely intensified it. It was the show coming out and dealing with people that were so horrible to me that triggered it.'</p>

<p>The blonde beauty said of dealing with trolls: 'It’s just the fact that it is repetitive negativity. That is really something that I don’t want to be a part of. And it’s just annoying to have to delete it... that was just for me what was overwhelming.'     </p>

<p>Depression and anxiety: The actress has also talked about how the show has affected her depression and anxiety: 'I know I’ve always had it, but the show definitely intensified it'</p>
