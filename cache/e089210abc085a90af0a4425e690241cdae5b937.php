<p>Powerful: Tilda Swinton made a 'Wakanda forever' salute at the Venice Film Festival on Tuesday in memory of fellow Marvel star Chadwick Boseman following his death from cancer aged 43</p>

<p>He famously played T'Challa, king of the fictional African kingdom of Wakanda and the crime fighter known as Black Panther, in the first major studio superhero movie featuring a predominantly Black cast.</p>

<p>With $700 million in grosses, the Oscar-winning film remains the second-highest grossing superhero movie of all time.    </p>

<p>When he passed away at his home in LA, his family said in a statement: 'It is with immeasurable grief that we confirm the passing of Chadwick Boseman. </p>

<p>'Chadwick was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016, and battled with it these last 4 years as it progressed to stage IV.</p>

<p>'A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much.'</p>

<p>The family revealed several of Boseman's recent films, including Marshall, Da 5 Bloods, and August Wilson's Ma Rainey's Black Bottom, were filmed 'during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy.'</p>

<p>'It was the honor of his career to bring King T'Challa to life in Black Panther,' the statement said. 'The family thanks you for your love and prayers, and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time.'</p>

<p>Boseman is survived by his wife Taylor Simone Ledward and a parent and had no children, his publicist said. The actor had kept his diagnosis and much of his personal life under wraps.</p>

<p>Tilda and Chadwick are both part of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe).</p>

<p>Meanwhile. LeBron James was among the chorus of people who expressed their grief and sadness over the passing of Chadwick on Friday.</p>

<p>The basketball great offered yet another tribute to the actor before his LA Lakers hit the court on Saturday to face off against the Portland Trailer Blazers in game five of their playoff series.</p>

<p>During a moment of silence, as the entire Lakers team took a knee in a time of reflection, James crossed his arms in the 'Wakanda Forever' salute.</p>

<p>The empowering salute has been used by everyone from NBA players to tennis athletes and soccer stars since the blockbuster film hit theaters in February 2018. </p>
