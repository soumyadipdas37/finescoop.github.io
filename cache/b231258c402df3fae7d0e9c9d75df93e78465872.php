<p>She said on Heart FM: 'My real name is Kelly Parsons and they used to call me Smelly Parsnips because it rhymes.</p>

<p>'Imagine sending that email, saying "You know, I've met this Prince, so can you just stop calling me Smelly Parsnips."</p>

<p>Kelly revealed that she had to ask others to stop using the nickname once she began dating. </p>

<p>The 40-year-old is currently dating Jeremy Parisi after they began dating in 2015, and in July, Kelly claimed that sex gets better with age and said her longterm love, 35, Jeremy is a big fan of her curves.</p>

<p>Speaking on Vicky Pattison's The Secret To... podcast, she said: 'My boyfriend is 35 and he is Italian, so, you know, he likes a nice large curvy woman so that's always a good thing! I think your sex life gets better as you get older!</p>

<p>'You get confident! You are not so hung up on stuff. You know what you enjoy. You know what you like, so you are not as scared to tell them.</p>

<p>'When you're young you don't tell them. They are like 'is that nice?' or whatever and you're like 'yeah!' When you're older you are gonna make sure you get what you want!'</p>
