<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of the world's largest brothels has been forced to file for bankruptcy after it was unable to operate for months due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>It has been reported that the Pascha brothel, in Cologne, Germany, has used up all of its cash reserves paying for the up-keep of its 10-storey building and 60 staff.</p>

<p>The German daily Express has stated that this has left the brothel from which about 120 prostitutes ply their trade penniless.</p>

<p>One of the world's largest brothels, Pascha, in Germany, has been forced to close leaving many prostitutes without a base</p>

<p>Prostitutes offered a wide range of services from the Pascha brothel, in Germany</p>

<p>It has been estimated that Pascha attracted up to 1,000 customers a day to partake of its services.</p>

<p>The Covid-19 pandemic has stricken the brothel as prostitution was banned in North-Rhine Westphalia, where Cologne is, five months ago to help curb the spread of the disease.</p>

<p>Pascha opened in January 1972 under the name of Eros Center and it was classed as Europe's first high-rise brothel.</p>

<p>Around 120 prostitutes offer services from the rooms located at the Pascha brothel, in Cologne</p>

<p>A coalition party in Holland is calling for paid sex to be banned in a move which could leave the future of Amsterdam's famous red light district uncertain.</p>

<p>The Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) have revived the debate to make paying for sex a punishable offence after presenting a proposal to cabinet.</p>

<p>The proposal, submitted by CDA MP Anne Kuik, is being debated today in Tweede Kamer, the lower house of Dutch parliament, Dutch News reported.</p>

<p>MPs will also discuss an initiative from Christian youth movement Exxpose to curb prostitution, which has more than 50,000 signatures.</p>

<p>Kuik said she hopes to tackle female inequality by banning legal prostitution. </p>

<p>She claimed that 95 per cent of women who work in Amsterdam's red light district are from poorer Eastern European countries, according to the NL Times.</p>

<p>Kuik wants to see the Netherlands implement a legal model similar to Sweden, which criminalised paid sex back in 1999.</p>

<p>Under the Swedish Government's laws, the buyer is prosecuted but prostitutes are not.</p>

<p>Kuik argues that while it is impossible to eradicate prostitution, the Government should try to prevent it from happening.</p>

<p>She also claimed that the legalisation of prostitution has not stopped abuse on sex workers, which 'continues to exist'. </p>

<p>The CDA's coalition partners D66 and People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) are reportedly opposed to the ban, saying it will only drive prostitution underground.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that the chance of criminalising paid sex in the Netherlands is extremely low due to this opposition.</p>

<p>But the motion is expected to be supported by other government parties, including the SGP and ChristenUnie. </p>

<p>The city of Cologne wanted to get rid of the red light district in the city centre and so it granted permission to build on the outskirts of the city.</p>

<p>In 1995 the Eros Center changed its name to Pascha where it rents, for 180 Euros a day, 126 rooms on seven floors to prostitutes.</p>

<p>This includes meals, medical care and the 20 Euros of tax which the authorities collect per prostitute per day.</p>

<p>Pascha is open 24-hours a day and customers pay a five Euro entrance fee and then they negotiate prices for services with the girls.</p>

<p>The brothel also houses a regular hotel, several bars and a club-style brothel on the top floor.</p>

<p>The business has suffered problems in the past too.</p>

<p>A Thai prostitute was stabbed to death by a customer in June 2003.</p>

<p>She managed to press the alarm button in her room and security personnel caught the culprit.</p>

<p>Then in January 2006 another prostitute was attacked by a customer with a knife.</p>

<p>The woman who was working next door heard the commotion and alerted security who grabbed the knife man before the prostitute was injured.</p>

<p> Following a police raid in April 2005 by police it was reported that a gun and some cocaine was uncovered.</p>

<p>Police also arrested 23 people mainly due to suspected violation of immigration laws.</p>

<p>Reports also stated that four of the prostitutes were only aged between 14 and 15 years.</p>

<p>Pascha was not fined this time since the girls, who were from Africa, looked older and they carried fake documents.  </p>

<p>Then before the Fifa World Cup, in Germany, Muslims complained that the brothel insulted Islam.</p>

<p>Pascha had a large poster showing a half-naked woman and flags from all of the countries which qualified for the tournament on one side of the building.  </p>

<p>In response to threats of violence and protests the brothel owners blacked out the flags of Iran and Saudi Arabia on the poster.</p>

<p>American rapper 50 Cent gave a concert in Pascha's night club in December 2009.</p>

<p>Then on Mother's Day 2011 the brothel orgainsed a tour for women.</p>

<p>This was surprising as women are not normally allowed into the building. </p>

<p>Groups representing sex workers have that the closure of brothels will likely force prostitution underground.</p>

<p>This, it is feared, will put the women at greater risk of violence or exploitation. </p>
