<p>MINI VICTORIA SPONGE CAKES</p>

<p>Also known as a Victoria sandwich, the Queen’s actual tea-time sponge cake would have been sandwiched with only a thick layer of raspberry jam and topped with a sprinkle of sugar.</p>

<p>The addition of a layer of whipped cream or buttercream is a more recent innovation, but one that the Crawley family would likely have enjoyed.</p>

<p>Mini Victoria sponge cakes, a smaller take on the classic for a classy garden tea party with your chosen few </p>

<p>Makes 12 cakes</p>

<p>For the cake</p>

<p>For the filling</p>

<p>Place a 29 x 43cm baking tray in the oven and preheat it to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas 4.</p>

<p>Lightly butter the bottom and sides of 12 x 180ml straight-sided ramekins or a 12-hole mini sandwich tin.</p>

<p>In a small bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. Put the butter in a large bowl and use an electric mixer on a medium speed to beat it for 1 minute, until smooth.</p>

<p>Add the caster sugar, increase the speed to medium-high, and beat for 2-3 minutes, until fluffy and lighter in colour. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and adding the vanilla along with the final egg.</p>

<p>On a low speed, add the flour mixture and mix until just blended. Divide the mixture among the ramekins or mini sandwich tin holes and spread evenly. Transfer to the baking tray and bake for 17-19 minutes, until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</p>

<p>Transfer the baking tray to a wire rack and leave the cakes to cool for 15 minutes. Run a thinbladed knife around the inside of each ramekin to loosen the sides, then invert each onto a wire rack, lift the ramekins off and turn the cakes rightside up. Leave to cool.</p>

<p>Now prepare the filling. In a bowl, using an electric mixer, beat together the cream and icing sugar on a medium speed for 2-3 minutes, until stiff peaks form. Fit a piping bag with a small plain or star tip, spoon the whipped cream into the bag, and close securely.</p>

<p>Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 2 hours before serving.</p>

<p>Just before serving, using a serrated knife, cut the cakes in half horizontally. Arrange the bottom halves, cut side up, on a work surface. Divide the whipped cream among the cake bottoms, piping small dollops around the edge and then into the centre, covering the bottom completely.</p>

<p>Spoon 1tbsp of the jam over the cream on each cake bottom, gently spreading it to the edge. Arrange the cake tops, cut side down, on top of the jam.</p>

<p>Lightly dust with icing sugar and serve.</p>

<p>BAKEWELL TART </p>

<p>This almond-and-jam-filled tart is all but a national treasure – and it is possibly the ultimate tea-time treat.</p>

<p>Though this tart is named after the town in Derbyshire where it’s likely that it was first introduced, its exact origins are unknown. You can use different jams or fruits, and also coat it with a sugary glaze if you like. Though, if you did, Mrs Patmore would say it’s no longer a Bakewell Tart...</p>

<p>An almond topped bakewell tart fit for even Downton Abbey's chef Mrs Patmore</p>

<p>Serves 12</p>

<p>For the tart pastry</p>

<p>For the filling</p>

<p>Mix together the flour, sugar and salt. Using your fingertips, work the butter in until the mixture forms coarse crumbs. In a small bowl, whisk the yolk and water, then add to the flour mixture.</p>

<p>Stir with a fork until the mixture is well-combined and forms clumps – add 1tbsp of water or more if needed.</p>

<p>Turn the pastry out on to a large piece of cling film and use it to cover the pastry and shape it into a smooth disc.</p>

<p>Chill for at least 1 hour or overnight. Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a fluted 23cm tart tin with a removable bottom. Roll out the pastry to a 30cm round that is 5mm thick.</p>

<p>Roll the pastry around the rolling pin, centre it over the tin, and unroll, allowing the excess to overhang. Press the dough onto the bottom and sides, then trim the edges, allowing a 1cm overhang.</p>

<p>Roll the overhang back over onto itself and press firmly to reinforce the sides of the crust. Place the pastry-lined tin in the freezer for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas 4.</p>

<p>Line the chilled pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake until the edges of the case are light brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and remove the beans and parchment. Return to the oven and bake for 7-9 minutes until pale golden.</p>

<p>Transfer the tin to a wire rack. Leave the oven on. To make the filling, put the butter, sugar, almond extract (if using) and salt in a bowl.</p>

<p>Use an electric mixer on a medium speed to beat for 2-4 minutes, until fluffy and light. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.</p>

<p>On a medium-low speed, add the ground almonds and beat until just blended. Spread the jam evenly in the still-warm pastry case.</p>

<p>Drop the filling in small spoonfuls over the jam, then spread carefully and evenly. Scatter the almonds over the top, if using.</p>

<p> Bake the tart for 35 minutes, or until the filling is puffed and the centre springs back when lightly pressed. Leave to cool completely on a wire rack.</p>

<p>To serve, place the tart tin on a can or overturned bowl and carefully slide the outer ring down. Using a fish slice, loosen the pastry and slide the tart onto a serving plate. Slice to serve. </p>

<p>QUICK STRAWBERRY JAM</p>

<p>Fruit preserves, particularly berry jams, are a mainstay of the afternoon tea table, and inside cakes such as Victoria sponge (see recipe, left), so the Downton cooks would have often been busy making batches.</p>

<p>Jam in the Downton era would have been served with a special spoon – usually small, silver and ornately embellished. </p>

<p>Place a couple of saucers in the freezer for testing the jam later on. In a heavybased and non-reactive saucepan over a medium heat, combine the strawberries, sugar and lemon juice and bring to the boil, stirring constantly, until the sugar dissolves. </p>

<p>Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring occasionally, for 10 minutes, or until the strawberries are tender and the juices that have been released thicken.</p>

<p>To test if the jam is ready, remove a saucer from the freezer and drop a small spoonful of the jam into the middle and leave it to sit for 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Then gently nudge the spoonful – if it wrinkles, the jam is ready.</p>

<p>If it doesn’t, then cook for 1-2 minutes longer and test again on another chilled saucer from the freezer.</p>

<p>When it is ready, carefully ladle the jam into sterilised jam jars and leave it to cool completely. Cover with the jar lids and keep in the fridge for up to ten days. </p>

<p>BUTTERFLY CUPCAKES</p>

<p>A civilised winged mouthful that is an elegant take on the traditional American cupcake</p>

<p>A more refined cousin of the traditional American cupcake, these pretty petite fairy cakes are topped with a dollop of whipped cream, a spot of jam and a charming set of ‘wings’ fashioned from the domed cake tops – a perfect small and delicate bite for any tea-time tray that Lady Mary would have liked.</p>

<p>Makes 12 small cakes</p>

<p>For the cakes</p>

<p>For the topping</p>

<p>To make the cakes, preheat the oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas 4 and line a 12-hole bun tin with paper cases.</p>

<p>In a small bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter on a medium speed until smooth (about 1 minute). </p>

<p>Add the caster sugar, increase the speed to mediumhigh and beat for 2-3 minutes until fluffy and light in colour.</p>

<p>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and adding the vanilla with the final egg. On a low speed, add about half of the flour mixture and mix just until blended, then add the milk and again mix until blended. Add the remaining flour mixture and mix just until blended.</p>

<p>Divide the mixture among the prepared cases and spread evenly. Bake for 17-19 minutes. Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Lift the cakes from the tin and leave to cool completely.</p>

<p>To make the topping, beat together the cream and icing sugar in a bowl using a handheld mixer on a medium speed, for 2-3 minutes until stiff peaks form. Use immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 2 hours before serving.</p>

<p>Just before serving, using a serrated knife, cut off the domed tops from each cake, then cut these domes in half crossways to form the ‘wings’. Spoon (or pipe with a plain tip) some of the whipped cream onto the centre of each fairy cake.</p>

<p>Put a small dollop (about ¼tsp) of the jam onto the centre of the whipped cream. Gently push two ‘wings’, cut-side down and at a slight angle, into the cream, positioning them on either side of the jam. Lightly dust the top of each cake with icing sugar, if desired.   </p>

<p>TEA SANDWICHES: CUCUMBER </p>

<p>With lunch at noon and dinner at eight, afternoon tea proved the perfect answer to snacking politely.</p>

<p>Custom dictated that the sandwiches be made with two thin, crustless slices of bread with various fillings, approved by a hostess such as the Countess of Grantham. cucumber.  </p>

<p>Serves 4-6 </p>

<p>Put the cucumber slices into a sieve over a bowl, sprinkle lightly with salt, and leave to stand for 20 minutes. Then lay a few sheets of kitchen towel on a work surface, arrange the cucumber slices in a single layer on the paper and pat dry.</p>

<p>Lay the bread slices on a chopping board and spread with butter. Arrange the cucumber slices, overlapping them, on 4 of the bread slices and sprinkle with pepper. Top with the remaining bread slices.</p>

<p>Using a serrated knife, cut off the crusts from each sandwich, then cut the sandwiches into neat fingers. </p>

<p>Dainty finger sandwiches to accompany the sweet treats at your summer tea party</p>

<p>TEA SANDWICHES: DEVILLED EGG &amp; CRESS </p>

<p>Serves 4-6</p>

<p>Place the eggs in a heavy saucepan, cover with water to about 2.5-5cm above them, and bring to the boil over a high heat. Remove from the heat, cover and leave to stand for 15 minutes. Transfer the eggs to a bowl of cold water for 15 minutes to stop them cooking.</p>

<p>Peel the eggs and drop them into a clean bowl. Mash with a fork, then add the butter, mayonnaise, parsley, dill and lemon zest and mix well. Season with salt, pepper and paprika, to taste.</p>

<p>Lay the bread slices on a chopping board. Spread 4 of the slices with the egg mixture, dividing it evenly. Arrange the watercress leaves evenly on top. Top with the remaining 4 bread slices and press firmly.</p>

<p>Using a serrated knife, cut off the crusts from each sandwich then cut the sandwiches into neat fingers. </p>

<p>TEA SANDWICHES: SMOKED SALMON &amp; DILL </p>

<p>Serves 4-6</p>

<p>In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese and dill and mix with a fork. Season to taste with lemon juice, salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Lay the bread slices on a board and spread the cream cheese on all 8. Arrange the salmon in an even layer over 4 of the slices, then top with the remaining 4 slices, cream cheese-side down.</p>

<p>Cut off the crusts then cut into fingers. </p>

<p>LEMON DRIZZLE CAKE</p>

<p>Warne’s Model Cookery And Housekeeping Book, published in 1868, has one of the earliest recipes for lemon cake, which calls for just four ingredients: eggs, flour, sugar and grated lemon peel. This version is more elaborate yet just as traditional. Carson the butler would have approved. </p>

<p>Lemon Drizzle cake is a staple that most bakers have under their belt. Here an elaborate list of ingredients transforms the basic bake</p>

<p>Serves 8</p>

<p>For the cake</p>

<p>For the syrup</p>

<p>For the glaze</p>

<p>To make the cake, preheat the oven to 190°C/fan 170°C/gas 5.</p>

<p>Butter a 900g (2lb) loaf tin, then dust with flour, tapping out the excess. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl.</p>

<p>In another bowl, using an electric mixer, beat the butter, caster sugar and lemon zest on a medium-high speed for about 3 minutes until light and fluffy.</p>

<p>Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition. Add the milk and vanilla and beat until blended.</p>

<p>On a low speed, add the flour mixture and beat just until blended. Transfer the mixture to the tin and smooth the surface.</p>

<p>Bake for about 55 minutes until golden brown and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.</p>

<p>Leave to cool in the tin on a wire rack for a few minutes, then turn out onto the rack. Turn the cake on its side to cool while you make the syrup.</p>

<p>Place the lemon juice and caster sugar in a pan over a medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve, then simmer for 2 minutes until syrupy.</p>

<p>Remove from the heat. Using a skewer, pierce the sides and the bottom of the warm cake with holes about 2.5 cm deep.</p>

<p>Brush the cake with the syrup so it seeps into the holes. To make the glaze, mix the icing sugar and lemon juice until smooth.</p>

<p>When the cake is cool, turn it right-side up on a serving plate and drizzle the glaze over the top. Leave to stand for 15 minutes, until set, then serve. </p>
