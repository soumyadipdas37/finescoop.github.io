<p>Looking good! Jessica Simpson showed off her 100+ pound weight loss in a new campaign for her Jessica Simpson Collection clothing line, slipping right into a pair of tiny Daisy Dukes</p>

<p>It was hard to believe it's been a full 15 years since she made jaws drop playing Daisy Duke herself.</p>

<p>Her dark denim shorts hugged her hips, skimming high up her thighs to reveal maximum amounts of leg.</p>

<p>Up top, Jessica continued to sizzle in a yellow checkered top which put both her midriff and her cleavage front-and-center.</p>

<p>Never afraid of a bit of glitz, Jessica piled on jewelry, adding bracelets, earrings, necklaces and a couple of eye-catching rings. </p>

<p>Time flies: It was hard to believe it's been a full 15 years since she made jaws drop playing Daisy Duke herself, above</p>

<p>Then: Jessica previously revealed her peak weight was 240lbs, after gaining 100lbs during her pregnancy with daughter Birdie, seen above</p>

<p>Summer fun: The 40-year-old radiated confidence in the sassy Southern look, pairing her tiny shorts with a tie-up top that flashed a hint of her toned center</p>

<p>Jessica made herself comfortable on set, posing with a pea-green, vintage van and several surfboards.</p>

<p>She continued to stun in a second look, which was just as leggy as the first. This time, Simpson invited her girls Birdie and Maxwell, eight, along. It seemed like a girls day, as son Ace Knute, seven, wasn't present.</p>

<p>Pleased: Yesterday the wife of NFL alum Eric Johnson told People how 'shocked' she was last month when she discovered she fit into a pair of jeans she wore 14 years ago</p>

<p>Happy lady: 'I was in complete shock,' the mother of three told the magazine. 'It was a good 40th birthday present.' Seen in August on SiriusXM</p>

<p>'I was in complete shock,' she told the magazine. 'It was a good 40th birthday present.'</p>

<p>In July she shared an image of herself to Instagram in the jeans looking proud. </p>

<p>In the caption alongside the picture, Jessica wrote: 'I have kept these throwback True Religion jeans in my closet for 14 yrs (I’m not exaggerating!). I figured that since I’m in the final hours of my 30’s I’d give them another try, and hello 40, so nice to meet you.'  </p>

<p>Now, in September, Simpson is still marveling over the fit. </p>

<p>The past: In 2008 with Tony Romo leaving Nobu in Malibu after having dinner</p>

<p>More denim looks: Jessica went to Social nightclub with friends in 2006, left, and Simpson shops for shoes at the upscale French designer Christian Louboutin shop on Burton Way in Beverly Hills her dog in 2004, right</p>

<p>The actress added: 'I've tried to pull those things over my hips so many times. I just thought my hips, from having babies, would never go back, but the jeans went up.'</p>

<p>It's been quite the transformation for Jessica who was 240lbs when she was at her heaviest, after gaining 100 pounds while pregnant with Birdie, her youngest. </p>

<p>'I was very open about being well over 200 pounds, on the heavy side of 200 pounds,' the singer said. </p>

<p>'I’m open about my insecurities and my flaws, and if I can help inspire anybody to feel better about themselves, that’s why I’m here.'        </p>

<p>Now she wears jeans all the time: Seen here in August in another pair of jeans; she has said she was once 240lbs but has lost 100lbs</p>
