<p>'So disappointed though AB was a great judge and there was no need for his performance.'</p>

<p>Speaking after the performance Banjo told MailOnline: 'This performance is extremely special to me and the rest of Diversity. 2020 has been an incredible moment in history for both positive and negative reasons. </p>

<p>'We wanted to use the platform we've been given to make our voices heard, express how the events of this year have made us feel and think about how we might look back on them in the future... We call it hindsight 2020.' </p>

<p>Speaking out: Some viewers took to social media to argue that the performance was a political statement which was not for a family show</p>

<p>Elsewhere other viewers praised the group and BGT bosses for depicting the issue.  </p>

<p>Emotional: Some Britain's Got Talent fans were moved to tears on Saturday night as Diversity took to the stage with a performance inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement</p>

<p>Captivating: Led by Ashley Banjo the former champions delivered a stunning dance reminding viewers of the movement</p>

<p>Here we go: The dance group were dressed in riot gear as they performed a routine narrating the Black Lives Matter movement</p>

<p>Moving: The group began the performance by reciting a viral poem The Great Realisation by singer Tomfoolery</p>

<p>Following the death of Floyd earlier this year thousands across the globe took to the streets calling for the officers involved to be jailed for their crime.  </p>

<p>Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged in June with second-degree murder while officers Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao – were also charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. </p>

<p>During Saturday's show Ashley Banjo stepped in for Simon Cowell after he was forced to miss the semi-finals due to a back injury. </p>

<p>Cowell was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. </p>

<p>The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest. </p>

<p>Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a write-off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, 'Where there's a will, there's a way!' </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Stunning: Meanwhile other Britain's Got Talent fans hailed the performance as 'powerful' and 'amazing' </p>

<p>'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.'  </p>

<p>Cowell underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. </p>

<p>This year marks the first time in BGT history that the semi-finals have been pre-recorded, and has also seen changes to the way acts will advance to the final. </p>

<p>Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.</p>

<p>With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences' reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.  </p>

<p>The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain's Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance. </p>

<p>Powerful narrative: Dressed in riot gear the dancers told the story of police brutality in light of the Black Lives Matter movement</p>
