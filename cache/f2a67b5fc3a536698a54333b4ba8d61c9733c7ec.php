<p>The parrots - named Billy, Eric, Tyson, Jade, and Elsie - joined Lincolnshire Wildlife Centre's colony of 200 grey parrots in August.</p>

<p>However soon the birds started encouraging each other to swear. </p>

<p>Five foul-mouthed parrots (pictured) have been separated after learning to swear at a Lincolnshire zoo </p>

<p>Steve Nichols, CEO of the wildlife park, said: 'We saw it very quickly; we are quite used to parrots swearing but we've never had five at the same time.</p>

<p>'Most parrots clam up outside, but for some reason these five relish it.'</p>

<p>The parrots have since been distributed to different areas of the park so they do not 'set each other off'.</p>

<p>Mr Nichols explained that nobody had complained about the parrots, but they were separated for the sake of young visitors. </p>

<p>The parrots - named Billy, Eric, Tyson, Jade, and Elsie - joined Lincolnshire Wildlife Centre's colony of 200 grey parrots in August and soon started encouraging each other to swear</p>

<p>This was in the hopes that they would pick up natural calls from the other African grey parrots.</p>

<p>'People have come to us, they think it's highly amusing, we haven't had one complaint,' he said.</p>

<p>'When a parrot tells tells you to f*** off it amuses people very highly. It's brought a big smile to a really hard year.'</p>

<p>The park is also home to parrot Chico, who made headlines in September after learning to sing a range of pop songs, including Beyonce's If I Were A Boy.</p>
