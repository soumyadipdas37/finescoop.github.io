<p>The oversized but flattering piece from ZANZEA comes in a whopping 30 colours from classic black to autumnal shades such as rust red, mustard yellow and olive green. And it costs a very reasonable £16.99.</p>

<p>'It's light but well made- perfect for adding a little warmth, or for full-on double layering,' one reviewer wrote. 'It looks stylish and I've had great compliments on the beautiful colour (I went with the dark red.)</p>

<p>'The fabric is soft and relaxed knit- it drapes nicely, vs others I've tried that were stiff and scratchy. Overall I'm pleased with this top - I'm here looking at more colors!'</p>

<p>Another shopper commented: 'Lovely top. Soft. Extremely comfortable. I did buy a size up as many clothes bought online tend to come up way to tight, but this top was lovely and baggy.</p>

<p>Washed very well and tumble dried well too. I'm after another one now in a different colour.'</p>

<p>Effortless stylish the bestselling sweater can be dressed up or down for day-to-evening styling - just add your favourite skinnies and heels. And it's also easy to layer on top of a vest.</p>
