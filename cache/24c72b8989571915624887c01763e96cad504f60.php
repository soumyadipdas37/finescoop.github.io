<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Matt Hancock today batted away criticism that former Australian PM Tony Abbott could get a job as a UK trade envoy despite complaints about his attitude to women and gay people.</p>

<p>The Health Secretary struggled as he was challenged over Mr Abbott's expected appointment to a post-Brexit role.</p>

<p>In a bruising interview on Sky News, Mr Hancock was told by presenter Kay Burley that Mr Abbott - who denies being homophobic or sexist - had previously said he was 'threatened' by homosexuality and men were better to exercise power.</p>

<p>Mr Hancock, who was wearing an NHS badge with the LGBTQ rainbow flag, said he 'bowed to nobody in my support for everybody to love who they love'.</p>

<p>'As far as I understand it, the proposal is that Mr Abbott supports the UK on trade policy, which is an area which he has got a huge area of expertise,' he said.</p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel tweeted a photo of herself with Mr Abbott last night</p>

<p>'I bow to nobody in my support for everybody to love who they love, whoever that is.</p>

<p>'But we need to have the best experts in the world working in their field and as the former prime minister of Australia, he has a huge amount of experience.'</p>

<p>Pressed on whether he felt that way even if Mr Abbott was a homophobic misogynist, Mr Hancock said: 'I don't think that's true.'</p>

<p>Burley said she had read some of Mr Abbott's previous comments, adding: 'He is homophobe, and he is a misogynist.' </p>

<p>Mr Hancock said: 'He's also an expert in trade.'</p>

<p>Mr Abbott opposed same-sex marriage, and was accused of misogyny by fellow former Australian prime minister Julia Gillard. </p>

<p>He was embroiled in controversy earlier this week, when he suggested nature should be allowed to 'take its course' for more elderly victims of Covid-19. </p>

<p>Mr Abbott told an event in London that 'it's a bad time for anyone with the virus, but it is also a bad time for people that would rather not be dictated to by officials'. </p>

<p>He said the current pandemic had forced governments to ask the question 'how much is a life worth'.  </p>

<p>But he argued that while 'every death is sad' that has 'never stopped families sometimes electing to make relatives as comfortable as possible while nature takes its course'. </p>

<p>Mr Abbott railed against lockdown rules as he called for them to be eased and for people to make more of their own decisions about the risks posed by coronavirus. </p>

<p>He said 'surely it is time to relax the rules so that individuals can take more personal responsibility'. </p>
