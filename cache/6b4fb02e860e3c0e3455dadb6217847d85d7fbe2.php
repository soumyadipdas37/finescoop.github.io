<p>'The sailor was not located upon a search on board which resulted in a man overboard being called and the activation of the search and rescue,' Cmdr Rebecca Rebarich told ABC News. </p>

<p>Authorities said the sailor’s name is being held in accordance with US Navy policy.</p>

<p>Since early June the Nimitz has been operating outside the Persian Gulf after deploying from San Diego.</p>

<p>It was the first carrier amid the COVID-19 pandemic to implement precautions and procedures to prevent an outbreak of the virus, according to USNI.</p>

<p>In early April, the carrier's crew of nearly 5,000 sailors were quarantined at its homeport in Bremerton, Washington.</p>

<p>Around the same time, the USS Theodore Roosevelt was crippled by an outbreak that sickened more than 1,000 sailors and led to the controversial termination of the ship's commanding officer.</p>

<p>The Roosevelt was forced to pull into a port in Guam on March 27 amid a rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreak. </p>

<p>At the time, at least eight sailors had been infected, but over the weeks to come, the virus would spread to more than 1,150 crew members and kill one sailor.</p>

<p>The vessel remained stationed in Guam for 10 weeks as the ship was sanitized and sailors were taken off to be quarantined, treated or tested.</p>

<p>The USS Roosevelt finally returned to its homeport of San Diego in early July after six months at sea.</p>
