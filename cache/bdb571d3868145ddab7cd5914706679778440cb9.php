<p>She wrote alongside the snap: 'Nothing brings me more joy than loving on my boys all day long. To ensure I can protect my kids' future, I am taking a stand against climate change and making a pinky promise to 'vote like a madre.'</p>

<p>Union: The Blood Ties actress and beau Marco secretly tied the knot in London in June 2013 in front of just family and friends</p>

<p>Last year, the Avatar star explained how she and her husband Marco have been raising their children in a gender-neutral environment, shying away from making their sons only play with toys that are aimed at boys.</p>

<p>'We have a very gender-neutral environment where my husband participates in a lot of tasks that were normally given to women and vice versa,' she said in an interview with UsWeekly.</p>

<p>'I get to do a lot of male things, which is, I don't know, put the TV together, fix things that break. We're sort of a very gender-fluid household. I think it's important to raise boys in that environment, and girls as well.'</p>

<p>True love: The married couple looked like honeymooners as they gazed at one another while on the beach</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite lockdown, Zoe is still as busy and in-demand as ever, currently filming not one but two sequels of the hit sci-fi epic Avatar. </p>

<p>Even though the first film - Avatar 2 - won't hit cinemas until December 2021, Zoe has been hard at work reprising her role of Neytiri alongside cast members Sam Worthington, Kate Winslet and Cliff Curtis. </p>

<p>In May, the official Avatar account shared a snap of Zoe, Sam, Kate and Cliff on an underwater set, where they were filming performance capture work. </p>

<p>Group fun: The pair also appeared to be joined by another family member on their day out</p>

<p>Last days of summer: Zoe, Marco, and their pals, all appear to have been spending the last few weeks in Malibu together</p>

<p>Cute family: Zoe has been spending time at the ocean with their three children, five-year-old twin sons Bowie Ezio and Cy Aridio, and another son Zen, three (pictured above last week) </p>

<p>'From the set of the sequels: Zoe Saldana, Sam Worthington, Kate Winslet, and Cliff Curtis taking a break from underwater performance capture for a quick photo," the official Avatar movie account tweeted.</p>

<p>'Fun fact: Much of the performance capture took place in this 900,000 gallon tank, built specifically for the sequels.'</p>

<p>It's been a long ride for Zoe and the cast, as the production on the two movies shut down in March due to the coronavirus. </p>

<p>However, they were able to start back up in New Zealand, where the country as a whole has handled the pandemic a lot better than the US, thanks to female prime minister Jacinda Aldern. </p>

<p>Fine form: The star showed off her incredible beach body on the weekend trip out to Malibu</p>
