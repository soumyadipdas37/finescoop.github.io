<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England were held to draw in Denmark on Tuesday evening as Harry Kane saw an injury-time effort cleared off the line following an error by Kasper Schmeichel.</p>

<p>Denmark's Christian Eriksen missed some glorious chance for the hosts as neither side could find the breakthrough.</p>

<p>JORDAN PICKFORD - 6.5</p>

<p>Was rarely called upon despite England's defensive struggles but made a brilliant reaction save from Dolberg when first tested from close range. We didn't learn anything new.</p>

<p>JOE GOMEZ - 6</p>

<p>The most quiet of England's back three, which is to his credit. No repeat of the untidy challenges which so nearly cost England in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>CONOR COADY - 6.5</p>

<p>Looked assured on debut and trademark crossfield balls were useful in creating openings. But he was unable to prevent England's back three looking vulnerable.</p>

<p>ERIC DIER - 6</p>

<p>Used his superior passing range to find Alexander-Arnold with some searching passes but still looks brittle defensively. Eriksen left him for dead with one simple turn.</p>

<p>TRENT ALEXANDER-ARNOLD - 6</p>

<p>Looked a promising outlet early on but struggled to make an impact, particularly going forward. Forced to do more defensive work than Southgate would have liked.</p>

<p>DECLAN RICE - 5</p>

<p>Industrious and willing as ever in midfield but offered no penetration going forward. Neither he nor Phillips really got a hold on Eriksen in Denmark's midfield three, either.</p>

<p>KALVIN PHILLIPS – 5.5</p>

<p>Played in an unfamiliar role in an unfamiliar system on debut. Showed some nice touches but struggled to impose himself as England lacked rhythm.</p>

<p>KIERAN TRIPPIER - 6</p>

<p>Another playing out of position and another who was largely impotent. A willing worker going both ways but offered very little attacking thrust or invention.</p>

<p>JADON SANCHO - 5 </p>

<p>Briefly grew into life after switching wings during the first half. But it was a false dawn as the winger failed to lay a glove before being replaced.</p>

<p>HARRY KANE - 6.5</p>

<p>Still looked short of sharpness but hardly helped by England's insipid display. His threat rose as England improved and alert to almost snatch victory at the death. </p>

<p>RAHEEM STERLING - 6.5</p>

<p>Targeted by early dirty tricks and too often starved of service. But he always wants the ball and wants to make something happen in attack.</p>

<p>MASON MOUNT – 7</p>

<p>His introduction and a change of shape coincided with an improvement in England's display. Showed his versatility by dropping deeper late on.</p>

<p>JACK GREALISH – 6.5</p>

<p>Showed an immediate willingness to take his man on and create openings on his much-awaited debut. Not given long to make an impact.</p>

<p>MAITLAND-NILES - 6</p>

<p>Special moment making a late cameo to earn his first cap.</p>

<p>Subs not used: Henderson, Pope, Mings, Keane, Ward-Prowse, Abraham, Ings</p>

<p>MANAGER: GARETH SOUTHGATE – 5</p>

<p>Change of shape didn't work and too slow to turn to Grealish, who seemed to be the obvious antidote to England's struggles.</p>

<p>DENMARK (4-3-3): Schmeichel 5.5: Wass 7, Jorgensen 6.5, Christensen 6.5, Skov 6.5; Norgaard 6 (Hojbjerg 73, 6), Eriksen 7, Delaney 6; Poulsen 6, Dolberg 6.5 (Falk Jensen 76, 6), Braithwaite 6.5</p>

<p>Subs not used: Andersen, Vestergaard, Kjaer, Maehle Pedersen, Dalsgaard, Lossl, Christiansen, Bruun Larsen, Cornelius, Ronnow, Hojbjerg</p>

<p>MANAGER: Kasper Hjulmand – 6.5</p>

<p>REFEREE: Istvan Kovacs - 6</p>
