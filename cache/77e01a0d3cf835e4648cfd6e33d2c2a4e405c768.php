<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Home cooks have shared the simple tricks they swear by for keeping half-eaten sauce jars longer in the fridge than the recommended 'use within three days'.</p>

<p>Pre-made food products such as tomato pastes and pasta sauces come with a short shelf life like 'consume within three days' or 'use within three weeks of opening'.</p>

<p>However, one Australian woman asked fellow cooks on the best ways to store the rest of her pesto sauce as she only needed a small amount for her dish.</p>

<p>'I only want a little bit of this but says to use in three days. Can I put the lid back on and put in the freezer?' she wrote in a Facebook group.</p>

<p>Her social media post was quickly met with dozens of practical tips, including placing the jar upside in the fridge or topping the sauce with a dash of olive oil.</p>

<p>A woman asked fellow cooks on the best ways to store the rest of her pesto sauce as she only needed a small amount for her dish. The label states you must use within three days of opening</p>

<p>'Top it up with a bit of olive oil then it will last in the fridge for up to a month,' one suggested. </p>

<p>Another said: 'You can always top it with a little bit of vegetable oil, just enough to cover the pesto and put it back in the fridge. I do this also with tomato paste to keep it longer.'</p>

<p>Many suggested keeping the jar upside down in the fridge as this prevents the sauce from going off.</p>

<p>'Store the opened jar upside down, stops air getting in,' one woman said.</p>

<p>Another woman added: 'Tip it upside down and put it in the fridge. It lasts for ages that way,' while one said: 'If you turn the jar on its head, the content falls, creating an internal vacuum, making it last until it's gone.'</p>

<p>Others suggested portioning the sauce into ice cube trays or ziplock bags to freeze and simply pulling out the amount needed during cooking. </p>

<p>'I normally put it in ice cube trays to freeze... I have no issues,' one woman said, while another suggested: 'The glass jar might shatter in the freezer as the pesto freezes. Pour into an ice cube tray or small freezer container.'</p>

<p>One person said: 'Freeze flat in a snap lock bag so you can break off small pieces as you need them. For low waste option, freeze small portions in a container or jar and pull out cubes as needed.'</p>

<p>'I put in ice cube trays then put it in ziplock bags,' one added,' while another person said: 'Freeze in a snap lock bag, pressed flat and just cut bits off as you want them.'</p>

<p>Pre-made food products such as tomato pastes and pasta sauces come with shelf life limits like 'consume within three days' or 'use within three weeks of opening'</p>

<p>Others admitted they never follow the 'after opening' instructions printed on sauces.</p>

<p>'I always have [sauces] in the fridge for ages. Don't worry about it too much,' one woman said, while another added: 'I never take notice of this. It's on tomato paste jars too but who uses a whole jar in a few days.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one woman suggested creating your own pesto sauce at home.</p>

<p>'I stopped buying pesto ages ago. I now make my own and it's delicious, you can control the ingredients to suit your taste, and freeze it in ice cube trays... then I toss the cubes into hot cooked pasta,' she said.</p>

<p>She said her recipe includes a 'bunch' of basil, 'small bag' of pine nuts, sharp parmesan cheese grated, 'couple' of garlic cloves, olive oil, and salt and pepper.</p>

<p>'Toss it in a blender to puree and freeze in cubes. You will never go back to store bought after making your own,' she added.</p>

<p>Adam Liaw (pictured) previously revealed there are two distinct smells to avoid if you are sussing out foods that have just edged past its use-by or best-before dates</p>

<p>Once a food with a 'use by' date on it has been opened, you need to follow any 'after opening' instructions such as 'eat within three days of opening'. If a food can be frozen, its life can be extended beyond the 'use by' date.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, MasterChef Australia 2010 winner Adam Liaw encouraged people to ignore 'use-by' and 'best before' dates - and instead use your nose to check whether the product has gone off.</p>

<p>According to the Food Standards of Australia and New Zealand, most foods can be safely consumed after the best before dates but they may have lost some quality.</p>

<p>In an opinion piece for the Good Food, Liaw said there are two distinct smells to avoid if you are sussing out foods that have just edged past its use-by or best-before dates.</p>

<p>'The first is putrefaction - the sour, disgusting and quite unmistakable smell of something that has gone off. Avoid,' he said.</p>

<p>'The second is rancidity. Rancid, oxidised oils have a waxy smell and while they might not make you sick immediately, they can be unpleasant tasting.'</p>
