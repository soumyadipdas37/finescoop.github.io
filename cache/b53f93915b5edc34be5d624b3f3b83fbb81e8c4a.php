<p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disease of the brain, in which build-up of abnormal proteins causes nerve cells to die.</p>

<p>This disrupts the transmitters that carry messages, and causes the brain to shrink. </p>

<p>More than 5 million people suffer from the disease in the US, where it is the 6th leading cause of death, and more than 1 million Britons have it.</p>

<p>WHAT HAPPENS?</p>

<p>As brain cells die, the functions they provide are lost. </p>

<p>That includes memory, orientation and the ability to think and reason. </p>

<p>The progress of the disease is slow and gradual. </p>

<p>On average, patients live five to seven years after diagnosis, but some may live for ten to 15 years.</p>
