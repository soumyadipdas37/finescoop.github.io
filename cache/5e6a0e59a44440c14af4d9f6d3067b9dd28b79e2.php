<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>As if the sight of Frank Lampard once again pulling the strings at Chelsea wasn’t enough nostalgia for fans to swoon over, Roman Abramovich is once again opening his chequebook and brandishing zeros like they were going out of fashion. It feels just like old times at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The Russian billionaire owner may have been conspicuous by his absence in west London over the past two years, but his commitment to the club has never been clearer after sanctioning a mammoth spending spree this summer – one that is set to become the biggest splurge in a single window by any Premier League club.</p>

<p>Signings are already through the door, with the club acting swiftly to land two of Europe’s most sought-after signatures.</p>

<p>Roman Abramovich is once again permitting Chelsea to splash the cash this transfer window</p>

<p>Frank Lampard is set to have a raft of new signings at his disposal to launch a bid for the title</p>

<p>Timo Werner had been closely linked with Liverpool, and it was thought the chance to work with Jurgen Klopp gave the Reds the trump card in the chase for the Leipzig frontman. In the end, it was Chelsea who captured the striker for £53m.</p>

<p>That added to the capture of Hakim Ziyech from Ajax, a signing announced as far back as February, a good gauge on how hard the recruitment team were working behind the scenes as they secured the 27-year-old for £38m.  </p>

<p>England full-back Ben Chilwell made the £50m move from Leicester and the Blues smashed their own transfer record by landing Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen. A £90m deal is far from in keeping with the post-coronavirus window, where the value of players has been deflated on the whole.</p>

<p>Chelsea made a huge statement by beating Liverpool to the signing of striker Timo Werner </p>

<p>In Hakim Ziyech, the Blues acted quickly to land one of the hottest properties on the continent</p>

<p>And all this is even before you consider the money spent on wages when it comes to two free transfers. </p>

<p>Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr swapped Ligue 1 for London this summer, with the pair leaving Paris Saint-Germain and Nice respectively after their contracts ran out.</p>

<p>It is a huge statement of intent from Chelsea, breaking all manner of records in a time where all clubs were expected to tighten the purse-strings, but not a surprising one given the clubs unique position.</p>

<p>A number of factors have aided them in finding the resources to complete their £231m splurge – more than any other Premier League club have spent in a single window.</p>

<p>Chelsea completed a £50million deal for and England defender Ben Chilwell </p>

<p>German wonderkid Kai Havertz is the most expensive player Chelsea have ever bought </p>

<p>One matter that has helped the club has been the transfer ban, which has prevented them from signing players over the last two windows.</p>

<p>The lack of opportunity to improve the team has forced the Blues to focus on a long-term plan of attack, with targets being worked on for more than 12 months. The break has given them not only more cash with which to play, but more time to sweet-talk top targets into agreeing a switch.</p>

<p>They have also been aided by some big sales. The money received from Real Madrid for Eden Hazard, and the cash from Atletico Madrid for striker Alvaro Morata, has sat untouched due to the transfer embargo.</p>

<p>It sees a return to the early days of Abramovich's reign, when money appeared to be no object </p>

<p>Between the two sales, Chelsea received just shy of £190m, all of which can now be put towards replacing their once prized asset, and once record signing.</p>

<p>Also helping Chelsea is the current worldwide pandemic. Coronavirus has changed football’s landscape, and UEFA are all too aware.</p>

<p>As a result, they’ve announced a postponement to Financial Fair Play regulations for this season. Instead, the period from 2019-20 to 2020-21 will be calculated as one. With Chelsea having spent nothing last season due to their transfer embargo, this provides the perfect opportunity to spend big.</p>

<p>It is why they are able to throw £231m at new players – a number that will now sit at the top of tables when it comes to club spending.</p>

<p>Manchester City had held that record previously – their spending spree in the summer of 2017 laying down a marker for the Pep Guardiola era.</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola and Manchester City spent big to improve their defence back in 2017 </p>

<p>A huge £227.5m was spent by City’s Emirati owners for the likes of Benjamin Mendy, Kyle Walker and Ederson as the Spaniard looked to shore up his defence. They even spent £57m in the January on Aymeric Laporte, but that fee doesn't count towards their summer splurge.</p>

<p>They could even inadvertently trump Chelsea again this window - only time will tell what happens with their pursuit of Lionel Messi and whether they get a free agent or have to pay a release clause of £630m. </p>

<p>So it is unsurprising that City, along with Chelsea, dominate the list of top 10 splurges in Premier League history, with the pair responsible for six of the biggest outlays.</p>

<p>After winning the title, Antonio Conte was afforded nearly £200m to ensure his Chelsea side competed with Manchester City in 2017-18, with a sizeable chunk of that funded by the sales of Nemanja Matic, Nathan Ake and Juan Cuadrado.</p>

<p>However, the likes of Morata, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Danny Drinkwater all failed to justify their price tags as the Blues limped to a fifth-place finish.</p>

<p>Manchester United have been prone to the odd spree, too, with Louis van Gaal handed £157.7m worth of fresh faces in 2014, though again the biggest names failed to make their mark – Angel Di Maria revealing some years later that he never wanted his British-record £59.7m transfer to go through in the first place.</p>

<p>There are examples of big business working well. Liverpool went all in in 2018 to bolster their squad in a bid to finally end their wait for a Premier League title. The likes of Alisson, Fabinho and Naby Keita were all key to their success as they lifted the trophy last season.  </p>
