<p>The world champion, who is Britain's richest sportsman with a £230million fortune, is out of contract with Mercedes at the end of the season and is expected to sign an extension worth £40m a year.</p>

<p>However, Hamilton has been putting contract negotiations on hold to prevent himself from becoming distracted as he aims for another world title.</p>

<p>Mercedes will use the 'larger gaps' in the calendar to confirm contract with Lewis Hamilton</p>

<p>At Silverstone last month Hamilton said that signing a new contract would 'not be a big effort' and that he was both relaxed and excited about continuing his career with Mercedes. </p>

<p>Speaking at Mugello on Friday, Wolff offered an explanation in regards to the situation surrounding Hamilton.</p>

<p>They said: 'This is a work in progress, and I wouldn't want to commit to a specific date,' Wolff said.</p>

<p>'We get on very well, but then when it comes down to the detail, you just need enough time to do that.</p>

<p>'With one race after the other, we don't want to really be distracted by contract talks. In between the larger gaps, like next week, we're moving towards a satisfactory outcome.</p>

<p>'But I don't know when it will be announced.'</p>

<p>The World Champion is expected to sign an extension with Mercedes worth £40million a year </p>

<p>The F1 driver has been with Mercedes since 2013, winning six drivers' titles with the team</p>

<p>Hamilton has been a member of the Mercedes team since 2013 and won five of his six world championships with the team.</p>

<p>During that time, Hamilton has also picked up six consecutive drivers' titles.</p>

<p>Asked if a new deal between Mercedes and Hamilton simply a formality, Wolff said: 'We didn't look at the contract for the last three years, and never took it out of the drawer.</p>

<p>'Sometimes situations change, and the environment changes, and therefore this is a time where it's another stint, another part of the journey that we want to go together.</p>

<p>'We're just debating.' </p>

<p>Hamilton will be racing in this weekend’s Tuscan Grand Prix - which will be the ninth race to take place over the course of 11 weeks for F1.</p>

<p>However, it will hold just two grand prix’s in the next four weeks as Sochi and the Nurburgring will become standalone events.</p>
