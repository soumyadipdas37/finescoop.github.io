<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Three Labour MPs have quit Sir Keir Starmer's team after voting against a government bill designed to shield soldiers from prosecution.</p>

<p>Beth Winter, Nadia Whittome and Olivia Blake voted against the Overseas Operations bill's second reading despite being ordered to abstain.</p>

<p>The MPs, who had all previously criticised it, were reportedly told if they voted against they would be forced to resign their positions.</p>

<p>Ms Winter was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.</p>

<p>Ms Whittome was the same for the Shadow Health Secretary and Ms Blake was for Shadow Scotland and at Shadow Digital Culture Media and Sport.</p>

<p>They were among 19 Labour MPs to break ranks with the party and vote against the bill alongside Mr Corbyn, who had criticised it.</p>

<p>The former Labour leader, who oversaw one of its worst ever election defeats, made his views clear in a tweet before the vote.</p>

<p>He posted: 'I have grave concerns that, as it stands, the #OverseasOperationBill the House of Commons is discussing today defies and undermines international law.'</p>

<p>Other dissenters included his allies Richard Burgon and Rebecca Long-Bailey, who was booted from Sir Keir's front bench for tweeting praise for an 'antisemitic' article.</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn tabled an amendment saying the bill 'violates essential rule of law principles such as judicial and prosecutorial independence and the absolute and effective prohibition of torture'.</p>

<p>But a Defence source told the Mirror: 'Labour can't make their mind up as a party - either they can't stretch to support it or they are so against supporting our troops they break the whip. It's lose-lose.'</p>

<p>It comes after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace triggered a row last night by suggesting British troops had taken part in 'illegal wars'.</p>

<p>Defence Secretary Ben Wallace triggered a row last night after he appeared to question the legality of the Iraq invasion while standing at the Commons despatch box</p>

<p>Mr Wallace appeared to question the legality of the Iraq invasion while standing at the Commons despatch box.</p>

<p>In a heated exchange with his Labour counterpart, Mr Wallace said: 'What we should recognise is much of the mess we are having to come and clean up today is because of your [Labour's] illegal wars, your events in the past.'</p>

<p>Labour defence spokesman John Healey replied: 'That is not worthy of the office of the Secretary of State for Defence.</p>

<p>'This is too important for party politics. It should be beneath the Secretary of State to reduce this to party politics.'</p>

<p>The row came as MPs debated legislation the Government has said will mean service personnel will be protected from 'vexatious claims and endless investigations'.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace said that the Overseas Operations Bill would provide 'certainty' for troops.</p>

<p>The Bill seeks to limit false and historical allegations arising from overseas operations by introducing a statutory presumption against prosecution, making it exceptional for personnel to be prosecuted five years or more after an incident.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace (pictured with Housing, Communities and Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick) suggested British troops had taken part in 'illegal wars'</p>

<p>To override the presumption, the consent of the attorney general will be required.</p>

<p>The prosecutor must weigh up the 'adverse impact of overseas operations on service personnel' and, where there has been no compelling new evidence, the public interest in cases coming to a 'timely conclusion'.</p>

<p>But campaigners and some senior military figures have warned that the legislation will create a presumption against prosecution of torture and other serious crimes, except rape and sexual violence.</p>

<p>General Sir Nick Parker, former commander of land forces, last week said he was worried the focus on prosecutions 'risks us being seen as setting double standards'.</p>

<p>Mr Wallace, a former soldier who served in Northern Ireland, rejected claims the Bill could decriminalise torture and murder.</p>

<p>He said: 'We've been told that this Bill is controversial. Some have gone as far to have said it decriminalises torture or prevents veterans from receiving compensation. Both allegations are untrue.</p>

<p>'It is our intention should new or compelling evidence be brought forward to prosecute for those offences. It is not decriminalising torture, it is not decriminalising murder.'</p>

<p>Mr Wallace added: 'We want the ability if necessary to allow soldiers to focus on the danger and job in hand in operations, not on whether they will have a lawsuit slapped on them when they get home.'</p>

<p>Afghanistan and Iraq were the major military campaigns in which Tony Blair sent British troops into combat. The latter proved particularly controversial.</p>

<p>In 2010, Nick Clegg was forced to clarify the government's position on the Iraq war after he denounced the invasion as 'illegal'.</p>

<p>The then deputy prime minister made the remarks while standing in for David Cameron at Prime Minister's Questions.</p>

<p>Mr Clegg later stressed his opinion was a 'long-held' personal one and Downing Street said he was not speaking for the government.</p>

<p>The Tories backed the then Labour government's decision to commit troops to Iraq in 2003, with current key figures including Boris Johnson all supporting the war.</p>
