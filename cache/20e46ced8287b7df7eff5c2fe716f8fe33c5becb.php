<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>24 Hours in A&amp;E viewers were left feeling 'squeamish' after a man was rushed to hospital after severing three of his fingers on his left hand with an electric saw. </p>

<p>In last night's episode of the Channel 4 show, Steve, 57, from the UK, explained how he was cutting some wood on a chop saw when the wood slipped and his left hand went under the blade, detaching three of his fingers. </p>

<p>While all three fingers were found and put on ice, viewers found the graphic scene hard-to-watch as surgeons struggled to re-attach them.  </p>

<p>'I'm not squeamish about many things on #24hrsAE but those amputated fingers... Poor guy,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'I watch soooo many medical shows and I can stomach a lot, but that guy's severed fingers.'</p>

<p>Steve, 57, from  the UK, was rushed to hospital after he severed three of his fingers on a chain saw in last night's episode of Channel 4's 24 Hours in A&amp;E</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, one person penned: 'I watch soooo many medical shows and I can stomach a lot, but that guy's severed fingers' (pictured)</p>

<p>Steve's partner Debbie, who accompanied him in the ambulance, explained: 'I had been off work. I told him to finish off the spare room - he had some painting to finish off.'</p>

<p>'I work at a local primary school. I had a big meeting that morning and my mobile phone went. I looked at the other people in that room and said, "It's Steve - he never rings me.' </p>

<p>'I just went, "everything alright" and he said, "I've chopped my fingers off." It's what horror stories are made of.' </p>

<p>Speaking of the time-critical injury, the surgeon explained: 'Every minute that the amputated part does not have a blood supply, there will be less of a likelihood of being successfully able to reattach that part.' </p>

<p>Steve responded: 'It was a stupid accident.' </p>

<p>The doctor went on to say that the aim of surgery was to 'save as many digits' as they could - but added it wasn't a straight-forward process.</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, one person penned: 'I sit with my fingers interlocked watching 24 Hours in A&amp;E. My absolute nightmare losing my fingers' (pictured)</p>

<p>'The likelihood is this is going to be a 12 hour plus operation. There is such a large amount of possibility of the outcome. Its very hard to predict it at this stage and there is  possibility that the operation may fail.' </p>

<p>Keeping in good spirits, Steve joked: 'At least I get a rest!' </p>

<p>After spending 21 hours in surgery, doctors were able to reattach all of Steve's fingers, but still didn't know whether he'd regain the use of his right hand.</p>

<p>Six months later, Debbie explained: 'Unfortunately, the index finger didn't live, so they had to amputate. Every day is a new challenge. Every day we realise there's something that needs adapting or that he needs a bit of help with,' </p>

<p>Steve added: 'There's a lot of things that I'm not able to do, or do as well as I was able to do - even simple things like tying shoe laces, doing up buttons, belts - anything like that is a lot more difficult.</p>

<p>'I'm sure there are going to be things that are going to be impossible, but i'm the type of person who doesn't really want to find the impossible. I'd rather find a way of getting around it.' </p>

<p>And many were quick to take to Twitter following the stomach-churning episode.</p>

<p>'I sit with my fingers interlocked watching #24hrsAE my absolute worst nightmare losing my fingers, they are the money makers,' wrote one, while a second penned: </p>

<p>'Watching #24hrsAE ... the man who’s chopped his fingers off literally the same fingers that my brother did. I wonder if they will be able to reattach them? #Ouchies'</p>

<p>A third added: 'Holy f***, his hand after he amputated his fingers.'</p>
