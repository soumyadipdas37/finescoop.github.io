<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Weekly squirts of a nasal spray could provide protection against Covid-19, research has suggested. </p>

<p>Ferrets received two doses of a solution — which contains an artificial molecule designed to boost the immune system  — a day before they were exposed to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Results reveal it slashed the virus' replication in their noses and throats by 96 per cent, reducing the risk of infection and cutting the odds of transmission. </p>

<p>The artificial compound — named INNA-051 — is set to enter human trials within the next four months.</p>

<p>It was first developed to help protect against the common cold and flu, but is yet to be rubber-stamped because it has not been convincingly proven to work. </p>

<p>Previous research showed it 'accelerated' anti-viral responses in throat cells from healthy volunteers and those suffering from asthma, and provided 'prolonged protection' to mice from rhinoviruses, which cause runny noses in humans.</p>

<p>If approved, the treatment could offer added defences to those at elevated risk from Covid-19 including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions.</p>

<p>The treatment was first tested in ferrets, which showed that it boosted their immunity making them better able to protect themselves against coronavirus</p>

<p>Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences to treat Ebola, the deadly hemorrhagic fever that emerged in West Africa in 2014. </p>

<p>Ebola, like COVID-19, is caused by a virus, and scientists are now testing remdesivir to treat coronavirus patients, but it's too soon to know if the drug works or not.  </p>

<p>Remdesivir produced encouraging results earlier this year when it showed promise for both preventing and treating MERS - another coronavirus - in macaque monkeys. </p>

<p>The drug appears to help stop the replication of viruses like coronavirus and Ebola alike. </p>

<p>It's not entirely clear how the drug accomplishes this feat, but it seems to stop the genetic material of the virus, RNA, from being able to copy itself. </p>

<p>That, in turn, stops the virus from being able to proliferate further inside the patient's body.  </p>

<p>NIH researchers in charge of the macaque study recommended that it move ahead to human trials with the new coronavirus. </p>

<p>Scientists have listened, and human trials for remdesivir first began in Nebraska. </p>

<p>Most recently, researchers trialing the drug at the University of Chicago reported that most of the 125 COVID-19 patients they'd teated with the drug had been discharged from the hospital, according to Stat News. </p>

<p>Two patients died over the course of the trial. </p>

<p>A paper detailing the trial on INNA-051 has been published on the research website bioRxiv, although it is yet to be peer reviewed.</p>

<p>The spray has been developed by Australian company Ena Respiratory, which first started work on the avant-garde treatment before the pandemic struck.</p>

<p>It contains molecules designed to trigger TLR2 and TLR6 receptors on mucosal epithelial cells lining the throat and nose, attracting hordes of white blood cells to the area and boosting immunity. </p>

<p>The trial of the spray on the ferrets was led by Professor Miles Carroll, deputy director and head of research at Porton Down of Public Health England.</p>

<p>Dr Christophe Demaison, managing director of Melbourne-based Ena Respiratory said: 'We've been amazed with just how effective our treatment has been.</p>

<p>'By boosting the natural immune response of the ferrets with our treatment, we've seen a rapid eradication of the virus.'</p>

<p>He added: 'If humans respond in a similar way, the benefits of treatment are two-fold.</p>

<p>'Individuals exposed to the virus would most likely rapidly eliminate it, with the treatment ensuring that the disease does not progress beyond mild symptoms.</p>

<p>'This is particularly relevant to vulnerable members of the community.</p>

<p>'In addition, the rapidity of this response means that the infected individuals are unlikely to pass it on, meaning a swift halt to community transmission.'</p>

<p>The firm said if human trials prove successful and funding is secured, the therapy could be rapidly manufactured at scale.</p>

<p>Professor Roberto Solari a respiratory specialist adviser to Ena Respiratory and visiting professor at Imperial College London, said: 'This is a significant development as the world races to find a solution to halt Covid-19 transmission and infection of at-risk populations.</p>

<p>'Most exciting is the ability of INNA-051 to significantly reduce virus levels in the nose and throat, giving hope that this therapy could reduce Covid-19 transmission by infected people, especially those who may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic and thus unaware they are infectious.'</p>

<p>The company has previously secured as much as £6.4million ($8.25m) in funding, and is appealing for further financial support in the trials.</p>

<p>The treatment has been designed to bolster protection against all respiratory diseases, as opposed to only the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The trial was carried out on 24 female ferrets that received different doses of the spray, and were sedated during its administration.</p>

<p>It is a challenge trial, which means the animals are exposed to the infective agent after being treated with possibly protective medication to see whether it will work. </p>
