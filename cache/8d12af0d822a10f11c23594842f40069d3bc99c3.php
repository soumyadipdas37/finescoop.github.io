<p> Sheffield United have finalised the captures of Jayden Bogle (L) and Max Lowe (R) from Derby</p>

<p>He has now filled those gaps in his squad by securing Bogle, 20, who operates down the right and Lowe, 23, who plays down the left.</p>

<p>Both sat out of Derby’s Carabao Cup win against Barrow on Saturday ahead of their moves to the Blades.</p>

<p>Bogle and Lowe will join goalkeeper pair Wes Foderingham and Aaron Ramsdale as major additions to Chris Wilder’s squad this summer.</p>

<p>Winger Oliver Burke will also move to Bramall Lane from West Brom this week in a swap deal that will see Callum Robinson, who spent the second half of last season on loan at the Hawthorns, go the other way.</p>

<p>Sheffield United kick off their season against Wolves next Monday, with Wilder hopeful of bringing in up to five new faces before the transfer window closes on October 5.</p>

<p>Oliver Burke is also set for a move to the Blades this summer form West Bromwich Albion </p>
