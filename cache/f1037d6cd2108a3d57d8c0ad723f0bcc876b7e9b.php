<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A police officer who responded to a Florida adult recently for a report of a disturbance discovered a naked woman using a sex toy taken from a shelf on herself in a back room.</p>

<p>According to an arrest affidavit, the bizarre incident took place at 7.20pm on August 31 at the Lion's Den Adult Superstore on Okeechobee Road in Fort Pierce, as The Smoking Gun reported.</p>

<p>Someone at the store called 911, reporting that a woman wearing a purple shirt and no pants was causing a disturbance. </p>

<p>Theresa Stanley has been charged with indecent exposure of sexual organs and petit theft after police say she was caught using a sex toy on herself while nude inside an adult store</p>

<p>The responding officer was met by a store clerk who informed him that the woman, later identified as 36-year-old Theresa Stanley, had removed a pink sex toy from its packaging, stripped off all of her clothes and was masturbating in public, according to the report obtained by DailyMail.com.  </p>

<p>As the officer entered the adult store, he was told that Stanley had retired to a stock room with the sex toy in hand.</p>

<p>'As I opened the doors and entered the stock room I found the female...sitting in an office chair with her feet up on a table,' the officer wrote in the affidavit. 'She had in her hand a pink colored, penis shaped sex toy that she was using in a masturbatory manner.'</p>

<p>As soon as the officer walked in, Stanley 'stopped making use of the sex toy and dropped it on the ground,' according to the document.</p>

<p>A clerk at the Lion'd Den Adult Superstore in Fort Pierce said Stanley had removed the toy from its packaging on the shelf, stripped off her clothes and proceeded to pleasure herself</p>

<p>A store employee told the officer that Stanley had also opened and tried on a clothing item.</p>

<p>The total cost of the stolen sex toy and the unspecified garment was just under $46.</p>

<p>Stanley was arrested and booked into the St Lucie County Jail on charges of indecent exposure of sexual organs and petit theft, both misdemeanors.</p>

<p>She was arraigned on the charges this morning and remained jailed on $1,500 bond.</p>

<p>Stanley, of Port Salerno, has a lengthy record dating back to at least 2001, which includes multiple convictions for soliciting prostitution and possession of drug paraphernalia, and resisting an officer. Earlier this year, she was arrested on a charge of grand theft auto.</p>

<p>In that case, which is still pending, Stanley was accused of stealing a red 1995 Chevy Tahoe from a gas station in Marathon , Florida, on March 23.</p>
