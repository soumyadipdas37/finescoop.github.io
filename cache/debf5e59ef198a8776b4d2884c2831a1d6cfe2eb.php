<p>In a 'message to my people' Marshall explained that he had been pretending to be happy for the sake of social media and couldn't do it anymore.</p>

<p>'Ladarius Marshall is floating away, going away, fading away. I have hurt people, I have loved people, and I have given all I am to few people,' he wrote in the lengthy since- removed post, according to E! News.</p>

<p>'Some people are strong enough to make it in the end but my fight stops here. I have loved so much that when something falls away it takes a piece of me with it. What's left of me is nothing, I'm empty,' he continued.</p>

<p>'I love each and every single one of you guys. I hope that God shows you the way. Hurt people hurt people, and I'm tired of hurting people. It's ok I'll be smiling wherever I'm going. I have Given up this time.'</p>

<p>'Please, please, please just know that you are very loved and cared about,' Gabi wrote before the post was deleted. </p>

<p>She later confirmed that he was safe and sound in a post on her Instagram story. 'Just to share with you guys, Ladarius is safe and okay,' Gabi wrote.</p>

<p>La'Darius was one of the breakout stars of the Netflix docu-series Cheer. He was quite candid on the show about his struggles as a child, including being sexually abused as a child.</p>

<p>'You have to battle yourself and battle your inner demons … because they tell you it is socially unacceptable to talk about it and you're being a wuss if you do,' Marshall told The Cut. 'And I just don't see how that culture is even close to being healthy. That's like me going through my entire life and not telling my story.' </p>

<p>Adding: 'I never wanted to be perceived as a victim... I don't like the word... I know what I've been through, but look how far I made it.' </p>
