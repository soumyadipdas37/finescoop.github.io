<p>'If you are reading this and are friends with both David and I, please continue to be friends with BOTH David and I,' she said. 'We are adults and hope no one feels obligated to "pick a side" - there are no sides. </p>

<p>'My motivation for posting this is clarity, I want everyone I love on the same page so no one is blind-sided by the news.'</p>

<p>A source told The Sun that 'everyone is shocked they have split.'</p>

<p>The insider added, 'Rainy is obviously heartbroken but she is strong and she's surrounded by her daughters and grandchildren.'</p>

<p>Last summer, the estranged couple moved to Merced, California; speaking with the Merced Sun-Star, Rainy said they enjoyed the 'family and community-centric personality' of the city, where she set up shop with her business, Jane Bond Surety and Insurance.</p>

<p>'I knew the moment I drove through here it was home,' she said. 'It’s so peaceful, so genuine ... we absolutely love it here. I love how non-showy everybody is.</p>

<p>'In the Bay Area it’s different. It’s big hat, no cattle. Over here, people really don’t care if you drive a nice car. They care about family and a clean, healthy life.' </p>
