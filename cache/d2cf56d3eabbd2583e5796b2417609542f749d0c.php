<p>And now it's been revealed how Channel 10 filmed the final episode, after a COVID-19 outbreak on set threw the show into turmoil. </p>

<p>Host Osher Gunsberg revealed some of the 'tech wizardry' used during the finale to make it look seamless, considering it was filmed last week across two countries, two states and a hotel room. </p>

<p>REVEALED: How Channel 10 used 'tech wizardry' to film The Masked Singer Australia finale (pictured) across two countries, two states and a hotel room - after a COVID-19 outbreak on set threw the show into turmoil</p>

<p>Osher filmed the finale in Sydney with judge Jackie 'O' Henderson, while judges Dannii Minogue and Dave Hughes filmed the finale with the three singers in Melbourne.</p>

<p>New judge Urzila Carlson filmed the show from her hotel room while in quarantine in Auckland, New Zealand. </p>

<p>After a fan tweeted that they were 'super impressed' at the feat, Osher revealed some of the details. </p>

<p>'They pulled magic out of a hat': After a fan tweeted that they were 'super impressed' at the feat, Osher revealed some of the details</p>

<p>'Thank you - and our production / tech team literally pulled magic out of a hat to make it work. We really pushed every boundary to make it happen. Tech wizardry,' he said. </p>

<p>He also shared a video of himself and Jackie O in their makeshift set for the finale, both standing apart and in front of green screens. </p>

<p>'Two countries, two states, two stages and one hotel room - the team at Warner Bros and Channel 10 truly rallied to get this made, and it's an incredible piece of television,' Osher said. </p>

<p>⁠He added that Urzila had hotel security come to her room because she was making too much noise while filming. </p>

<p>'Best bit was during the very end of filming it got quite late in the night here in Australia, and because of the time difference it was even later in NZ - so at one point Urzila had hotel quarantine security banging on her door because she's screaming "TAKE IT OFF" into a webcam at two in the morning,' Osher said. </p>

<p>He also revealed that they used two 'flutter drops' of confetti during the finale to 'make it look legit;' one in Sydney and one in Melbourne. </p>

<p>Not only were fans seriously impressed, so to was Dannii Minogue. To audience members at home, it appeared as though the whole panel - and Osher - were in studio. </p>

<p>But at the start of the show, they made it clear that they were filming from different locations.</p>

<p>'I have to keep reminding myself that three of us were not even in the studio - this looks incredible,' Dannii tweeted during the finale. </p>

<p>What a feat! Not only were fans seriously impressed, so to was Dannii Minogue. To audience members at home, it appeared as though the whole panel - and Osher - were in studio</p>

<p>One fan hilariously remarked: 'This green screen magic is giving me trust issues.' </p>

<p>Network 10 executive producer Stephen Tate previously told Mediaweek that the finale was a 'technical feat.'</p>

<p>'What the finale became was a technical feat and it got the best out of our crews that I have ever seen,' he said. </p>

<p>He added: 'To produce a show out of two countries, two states, two studios…and a hotel room…is not something I have ever done before, nor would many of the crew have ever done anything like it before.'</p>

<p>Production at Docklands Studios had been suspended on August 22 after a COVID-19 outbreak on set, and the entire cast and crew went into self-isolation. </p>

<p>'Production on The Masked Singer has been immediately suspended as a result of several crew members receiving a positive test result for COVID-19,' a Channel 10 spokesperson said at the time.</p>

<p>'The health and safety of the community, and our staff and production partners is our number one priority.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile on the show on Monday, the Bushranger was crowned the winner of The Masked Singer Australia. </p>

<p>The celebrity inside the costume was revealed to be Neighbours star Bonnie Anderson, 25. </p>

<p>Continuing her winning streak, judge Dannii Minogue yet again guessed right, disagreeing with Dave Hughes who was long convinced it was Jessica Mauboy.  </p>

<p>Emerging from the costume, actress Bonnie said she was excited to return to singing after a stint on television.</p>

<p>'I haven't really been singing for a while, you know. Neighbours has kind of taken a lot of my time, so it has kind of sparked up a little bit of fire in me,' she said.</p>

<p>Bonnie added that she struggled to keep her identity hidden from friends and family.</p>

<p>Surprise! Meanwhile on the show on Monday, the Bushranger was crowned the winner of The Masked Singer Australia. The celebrity inside the costume was revealed to be Neighbours star Bonnie Anderson, 25</p>
