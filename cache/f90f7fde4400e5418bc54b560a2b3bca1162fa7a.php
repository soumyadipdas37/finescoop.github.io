<p>A man allegedly murdered his brother with a samurai sword at a Melbourne shopping centre because of bizarre delusions about pre-destiny and time travel.</p>

<p>Jonathan Dick had paranoid schizophrenia when he killed his sibling, David, with a knife and samurai sword in the Westfield Doncaster shopping centre car park in February 2017, a forensic psychiatrist says.</p>

<p>Similar delusions drove Dick to try to murder former classmate David Cammarata with a pick hammer outside the man's Keilor home in August 2018, Ranji Darjee told Victoria's Supreme Court on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Justice Lex Lasry was urged to find Dick not guilty of the charges by way of mental impairment.</p>

<p>The court was told the 42-year-old had delusions about aliens, September 11, and the Ku Klux Klan and Hells Angels.</p>

<p>Dick believed he was predestined to kill his brother and feared harm, perhaps even death, would befall himself and others if he didn't go ahead with it, Dr Darjee said.</p>

<p>The psychiatrist added Dick believed he would be transported to the future afterwards so he could avoid jail.</p>

<p>He also became convinced Mr Cammarata was part of a conspiracy to attack him when the pair were schoolboys, linked to groups including the Hells Angels.</p>

<p>Dick told Mr Cammarata 'you had this coming' when he tried to murder him, prosecutor Patrick Bourke told the court.</p>

<p>He said there was sufficient evidence to find Dick not guilty of murder and attempted murder by way of mental impairment.</p>

<p>Dick became one of Australia's most wanted fugitives after going on the run after his brother's murder.</p>

<p>He was chased down and arrested after Mr Cammarata spotted him lurking in a CBD car park in August last year.</p>

<p>He was doing better in prison because of medication, and his delusional memories had disappeared entirely, Dr Darjee said.</p>

<p>Justice Lasry is due to hand down his decision on Friday.</p>
