<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Late Australian cricket legend Dean Jones was about to risk it all in 1999, by putting up $10million to bring David Beckham and Manchester United to Australia.</p>

<p>Jones had a thriving event management company known for bringing huge acts Down Under - but the business of live events and sport is always a huge risk.</p>

<p>On the eve of the biggest deal of his life, his long-time friend Elton John saved the batsman from financial ruin, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>Late Australian cricket legend Dean Jones was about to risk it all in 1999, until he spoke with  his long-time friend Elton John</p>

<p>David Beckham and Victoria Adams (now Victoria Beckham) were among the most famous couples in the world in 1999 when this photo was taken</p>

<p>Jones was part of a three-man consortium that had just pulled off a major coup bringing the FIFA World XI to Australia to play the Socceroos.</p>

<p>They'd also got mega-band INXS back together after the death of singer Michael Hutchence to launch the Sydney Olympic Stadium ahead of the 2000 Games.</p>

<p>Although it was major windfall netting $15million, the process was far from smooth sailing.</p>

<p>Jones had to get a $5million loan against his family house and there were talks the band could pull out up until the morning of the show.</p>

<p>Any last-minute crisis could have ruined Jones and the stress of the huge business gamble was something he vowed to never go through again.</p>

<p>But with the David Beckham's Manchester United fresh off European football's Triple Crown, an opportunity presented itself.</p>

<p>The powers that be at the club wanted Jones to put up $10million for a tour of Australia.</p>

<p>He was about to sign but decided to give it a final thought. </p>

<p>That night he visited superstar singer-songwriter Elton John in his hotel room at the Crown Casino in Melbourne.  </p>

<p>'I told Elton what date they were playing (in July),' Jones recently said on a podcast hosted by Australian cricketer Shane Watson in June. </p>

<p>Jones said it was then he realised that the date clashed with the Beckhams' wedding, where Elton had been invited to play.  </p>

<p>'And I've gone, "ohhhh, so half the team is going to be with Beckham!"'</p>

<p>Jones knew with the likes of Beckham, Paul Scholes, Roy Keane, Gary Neville and more likely to be a no-show, the financial risk was huge.   </p>

<p>'I went back to them (United management) and said, "is that date right?" I said, "you've got nothing on?",' Jones said.</p>

<p>'They didn't care. Not worried about advertising these guys' names and they don't turn up.</p>

<p>'Rene Rivkin was also trying to bid for it and I gave it to him for $200k and he ended up taking the heat.' </p>

<p>He quickly bailed on the plan and credited his mate Elton with saving him from potential bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Following the shock news of Jones' death last week aged 59 in India, Elton took to social media to voice his heartfelt sorrow. </p>
