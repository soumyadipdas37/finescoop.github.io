<p>Cover stars: Padma Lakshmi took a moment on Tuesday to dish to Parents Magazine about her close relationship with daughter Krishna, 10, specifically about their diet</p>

<p>'There are a lot of things I'm not strict about, like bedtime, but I've always been pretty strict about what she eats,' Padma said in Parents' October issue, which she covers.  </p>

<p>'I believe you set a child's eating patterns by the time they're four or five, and the best way to get a child to eat healthily is to eat well yourself.'</p>

<p>Lakshmi went on to explain that she and her daughter do their best 'to keep our diet 50 percent fruits and vegetables, and Krishna knows that I'll look over her plate' before they chow down.</p>

<p>But Krishna, who grew up on the set of Top Chef, has become privy to her mom's watchful eye.</p>

<p>'Her favorite thing is to raid craft services when I'm not looking,' Padma said, laughing.</p>

<p>'I try to get the caterers to rearrange the food so that she can't reach the sugary cereals all the time.'</p>
