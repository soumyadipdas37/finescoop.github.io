<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>American Airlines has imposed an indefinite ban on a passenger after she handed a flight attendant an expletive-laden handwritten note calling her, among other things, 'a glorified maid' and a 'mask Nazi.'</p>

<p>The incident took place on September 3 and was purportedly sparked by a dispute over the airline's policy requiring all passengers to wear face coverings in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. </p>

<p>One traveler apparently took umbrage at being asked to cover her nose with her face mask and decided to make her feelings known to one of the flight attendants. </p>

<p>This screenshot shared on Twitter on September 3 shows a note that an angry passenger handed to an American Airlines flight attendant after she asked the woman to wear a face mask properly </p>

<p>When the flight reached its destination, which has not been revealed, and passengers were getting off the plane, the disgruntled traveler handed the flight attendant a note written on a folded paper bag marked 'WASTE.'</p>

<p>Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>hibiscuslacoix shared a screenshot of the profanity-filled derogatory screed later that same day, writing: 'today a passenger handed this to a flight attendant upon deplaning. the flight attendant had asked her to wear her mask over her nose.' </p>

<p>The note opened with the words: 'You mean s*** in life. You are nothing but a glorified maid who needs to jump down off her high horse and learn how to speak to ppl [sic]. Nobody cares about your stupid seat policies or your nose issues. We pay your salary and your attitude is unnecessary.'</p>

<p>The indignant passenger continued, further ratcheting up her rhetoric: 'The very fact that we have to listen &amp; kowtow to a nobody who does s*** except collect our trash and serve crappy food makes me absolutely ill. You are a mask nazi [sic] and a 4 eyed c*** and if it wasn’t for this job, you would be cleaning motel rooms for $2 tips and meth.'</p>

<p>The author of the vile missive directed at the unsuspecting American Airlines employee concluded by explaining her decision to write it on a bag intended for the disposal of refuse.</p>

<p>'I make sure to write it on a bag labeled as to what I think your life actually is... A WASTE,' she clarified. </p>

<p>American Airlines has banned the passenger who wrote the note and launched an investigation into the incident </p>

<p>The infuriated passenger did not use her name when signing the letter, instead writing, 'a person who hates your guts.'  </p>

<p>American Airlines has confirmed the incident involving the offensive note and said it is investigating. </p>

<p>Airline spokesman Curtis Blessing told McClatchy News in a statement that the passenger's ability to fly American has been suspended. </p>

<p>'Our flight attendants are professionals who play a critical role in ensuring the health and safety of our passengers, and we will not tolerate mistreatment of them,' he added.  </p>
