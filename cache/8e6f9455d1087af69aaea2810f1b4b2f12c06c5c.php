<p>Stories of sex demands, drug binges and embarrassing mishaps at 30,000 feet are all detailed by flight attendants on an online forum.</p>

<p>The collection of anecdotes 'will make any rabble-rousers think twice', a source told the Sun. </p>

<p>BA cabin crew have revealed some of the most shocking tales involving celebrities at 30,000 feet</p>

<p>A 'horny' reality star who wrapped her legs around a passenger is one of the salacious stories told</p>

<p>The accounts posted online are genuine due to the need for air stewards and stewardesses to verify their identification when joining the forum.</p>

<p>Among the stand-out stories are that of a singer who shouted for someone to perform a sex act on her after sinking to her knees during turbulence and another who threw a tantrum on the floor as she refused to board a bus from the plane to the terminal.</p>

<p>Drug and booze sessions resulted in another star constantly pressing the call bell while coming down from cocaine, and a TV favourite soiling himself after drinking too much.</p>

<p>That particular individual then had to be changed out of his clothes and put in a wheelchair to take him through to the terminal. </p>

<p>Furthermore, crew recalled the filmmaker who was so drunk he tried to open the cockpit door, thinking it was the toilet.</p>

<p>Staff also revealed their woe at some particularly rude A-list passengers, including a TV property show host who was criticised for trying to secretly upgrade her children while on the flight and a supermodel who was so difficult to deal with, they played rock, paper, scissors to determine who would serve them.</p>

<p>Another telly favourite, who often flew to Nice in France, workers said, basked in the attention of his fame but would refuse to speak back to anyone who acknowledged him, all while spreading himself across three seats in a row.</p>

<p>Other celebrities were accused of taking pictures of cabin crew eating their lunch and shaming them for eating rather than working, while another, who wore Mickey Mouse ears on a trip back from Florida, criticised flight attendants for not meeting their various demands quickly enough.</p>

<p>Drug and booze sessions resulted in another star constantly pressing the call bell while coming down from cocaine, and a TV favourite soiling himself after drinking too much</p>

<p>A former Prime Minister also featured in the tales, with staff claiming he personally blamed one individual for his TV system not working.</p>

<p>The steward is said to have quipped in response: 'So it's my fault your inflight entertainment is broken? It's your fault the whole country is broken — can we put things into perspective please.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere, one musician reportedly started sarcastically searching overhead lockers for prawns when told they weren't on the menu, while another spent ages in the toilet before finally emerging topless.</p>

<p>As well as tales of woe among a string of celebrities, who are not being named, there was praise for other stars such as Joanna Lumley, David Beckham and Jennifer Aniston, while the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were applauded for refusing to be upgraded to First Class before their wedding.</p>
