<p>And the 40-year-old comedian opened up about the diagnosis and her personal experience with the COVID-19 testing process in an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci on her YouTube channel.</p>

<p>'That was three months ago, I've been tested 12 times now because I've been working and everything,' said Haddish in the nearly 35-minute video uploaded on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Positive: Tiffany Haddish revealed that she previously tested positive for the coronavirus</p>

<p>She explained that her journey with the virus began when someone involved in a movie she was working on contracted it, unexpectedly. </p>

<p>'I was not in direct contact with them, but they sent all of us home, we stopped the movie. They suggested I go get tested.</p>

<p>'I got tested, got the results back two days later, they said I didn’t have the coronavirus,' said the Girls Trip star.</p>

<p>But Tiffany was forced to get tested again after learning that someone in her circle tested positive for COVID-19.    </p>

<p>The man with the answers: And the 40-year-old comedian opened up about the diagnosis and her personal experience with the COVID-19 testing process in an interview with Dr. Anthony Fauci on her YouTube channel</p>

<p>12 times: 'That was three months ago, I've been tested 12 times now because I've been working and everything,' said Haddish in the nearly 35-minute video uploaded on Tuesday</p>

<p>'Get the tests the second time. I'm not feeling any symptoms or anything, and it comes back like two days later, and they said I did have the coronavirus.'</p>

<p>Although she did not exhibit any of the virus' symptoms, Tiffany made the responsible decision to quarantine at her home.</p>

<p>After remaining in lockdown for the recommended time period, the actress reemerged and subjected herself to another round of coronavirus testing.</p>

<p>'Then I went and tested again, didn't have the virus, and then I got tested for antibodies, they said I had antibodies.</p>

<p>Origin story: She explained that her journey with the virus began when someone involved in a movie she was working on contracted it, unexpectedly</p>

<p>In the clear: 'I got tested, got the results back two days later, they said I didn’t have the coronavirus,' said the Girls Trip star</p>

<p>'Then I get tested again, no virus, and then I had them test me for antibodies again, and then they said I don't have any antibodies,' exclaimed Tiffany, before throwing her hands up. </p>

<p>'So I think I'm superhuman,' she added playfully.</p>

<p>Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained that her 'antibodies are gone because they probably had a very short half life.'</p>

<p>Uh oh: 'Get the tests the second time. I'm not feeling any symptoms or anything, and it comes back like two days later, and they said I did have the coronavirus'</p>

<p>'What I can tell you almost for sure, Tiffany, is that you have some residual immunity, probably T cells that are being able to protect you,' he added.</p>

<p>Although Haddish may have built up some immunity against the novel coronavirus, Fauci warned her that because the virus is so new, 'we don't know how long you're protected' from it.</p>

<p>'You should not assume, Tiffany, that you are completely protected.' </p>

<p>Be cautious: Although Haddish may have built up some immunity against the novel coronavirus, Fauci warned her that because the virus is so new, 'we don't know how long you're protected' from it</p>
