<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bond boost: Several banks are now paying 1.2 per cent fixed for one year</p>

<p>New banks have been leapfrogging each other to pay top rates on fixed-rate bonds.</p>

<p>There are now several which pay 1.2 per cent fixed for one year, compared with a very top rate of 1 per cent earlier in the summer. The best rate is currently 1.25 per cent on offer from Secure Trust Bank.</p>

<p>Today, OakNorth Bank is raising its one-year bond to 1.23 per cent while Aldermore Bank has reappeared among the top pays with a rate of 1.2 per cent.  It joins Allicia, Paragon and United Trust banks all of which pay 1.2 per cent.</p>

<p>Kent Reliance pays 1.17 per cent, making it the best deal in the high street for those who prefer to use a branch rather than open an account online.</p>

<p>These rates are far better than those offered by the big banks. HSBC and Barclays offer just 0.3 per cent on their one-year fixed-rate bonds.</p>

<p>You earn very little extra for tying your money up for longer with the top two-year rate at just 1.35 per cent from Secure Trust.</p>
