<p>Welcome! Scott Cam (pictured) tells them that they can invite their children and families on set - and the show will fund it all. Airfares would be covered, and a school house would be built for little ones to study with a tutor</p>

<p>But they have tough decisions to make, and Jimmy, 33, and Tam, 31, from Brisbane, wonder if bringing their daughter Frankie, four, to set is a good idea. </p>

<p>No option: For Daniel, 35 and Jade, 34, from South Australia, there was no decision to make - instead the farmers were left weeping when they realised they could not have their family with them despite the generous offer due to the family farm needing tending </p>
