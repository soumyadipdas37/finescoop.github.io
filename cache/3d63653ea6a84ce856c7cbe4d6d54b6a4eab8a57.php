<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ronald Koeman's decision to bring Philippe Coutinho back into the fold at Barcelona could. prove very lucrative to his former side Liverpool.</p>

<p>According to Spanish outlet Sport, the Reds are in line for a £5million windfall if the Brazilian plays a further 15 matches for the Catalan side this season.</p>

<p>It was one of a number of add-ons said to have been included by Liverpool in the £145m sale of Coutinho to Barcelona back in January 2018. </p>

<p>Ronald Koeman's (right) decision to bring Philippe Coutinho (left) back into the fold at Barcelona is reportedly set to be lucrative to the tune of £5million for his former side Liverpool</p>

<p>Reports in Spain detail that Jurgen Klopp's side are due £5m if Coutinho plays 15 more games</p>

<p>Under previous boss Quique Setien it appeared this clause would cease and expire with Coutinho having no future in the side. </p>

<p>But after helping Bayern Munich win the 2019-20 Champions League - which included a role in the 8-2 demolition of Barcelona which cost Setien his job - Koeman is keen to reintroduce Coutinho into the side as he looks to shake-up a squad that became disillusioned by the end of last season.</p>

<p>There had been Premier League interest in Coutinho and any switch would have made an appearance clause redundant for Liverpool.</p>

<p>Arsenal, Tottenham and Leicester all had an interest in the former Liverpool attacking midfielder.</p>

<p>Coutinho cut short his time away during the off-season to fight for his place at Barcelona</p>

<p>There were question marks under the last management but Koeman is ready to utilise him</p>

<p>But Koeman was swift in reaching the Brazilian, according to the player's agent Kia Joorabchian.</p>

<p>Speaking to talkSPORT, he explained: 'Koeman called him right after the Champions League victory with Bayern, the following day, and told him he's very much in his plans and would like him to return </p>

<p>'He was due to return on September 7 but actually he returned at the beginning of September because he didn't want to lose his momentum and fitness, and he's been training with Barcelona.</p>

<p>'All signs point to the fact Barcelona have changed quite dramatically, the way their philosophy of how they wanted to move forward from last year and the players they've brought in, like Coutinho, (Ousmane) Dembele and (Antoine) Griezmann, they're all going to be part of the squad this year.' </p>

<p>Coutinho, who could be used as a centra midfielder in Koeman's system, cut short his break to resume training in a bid to impress his new manager and ensure he forces his way back into the Barcelona side - something that will no doubt be encouraged by Liverpool with a windfall reportedly due in 15 games time.  </p>

<p>Coutinho spent last season on loan at Bayern Munich and won the Champions League </p>
