<p>Dishing: Rachael Leigh Cook took part in a new video interview on Thursday, in which she made another reference to her new man, so far known only as Kevin</p>

<p>The film follows a single man (played by Wayans) who sues a dating app company after being promised he'd find love, which prompted the pair of stars to share their opinion of online dating.</p>

<p>'I have a little bit, you know, it's interesting,' Cook, who split from husband of 15 years Daniel Gillies last year, said of meeting someone online. </p>

<p>'It's the best possible way to talk to a stranger. I like it!' </p>

<p>Love, not guaranteed: The film follows a single man who sues a dating app company after being promised he'd find love, which prompted the stars to share their opinion of online dating</p>

<p>However Cook, who shares two children with Gillies, was quick to follow up with the fact that she's no longer on the market.</p>

<p>'But I'm dating someone wonderful now, so I've stopped that,' she stated, referring to her new beau Kevin, to whom she's referred as a 'fancy' producer and swim teacher.</p>

<p>And it should be mentioned, Rachael did not meet Kevin online – she was reported set up through her dear friend, Jawbreaker star Judy Greer.  </p>

<p>But Cook did maintain that, 'as an actor,' meeting someone online is 'interesting'.</p>

<p>'It's pretty fun to see the way – just as an actor – I just think it's interesting to see how people present themselves,' she added during the chat. </p>

<p>'There's a character study moment.' </p>

<p>Damon, meanwhile, couldn't help but crack a joke.</p>

<p>'I online date mainly when my wife's asleep,' the Happy Endings actor kidded.</p>

<p>Damon couldn't help but crack a joke: 'I online date mainly when my wife's asleep'</p>

<p>But he did say he had friends with good online dating stories, as well as those with 'horror stories'.</p>

<p>Still, 'I know a couple who have been going strong for probably like three years now and they met online,' he added.</p>

<p>Rachael concurred, mentioning her 'friend [who] has been married for five years now to "SilverlakeRob" and we can't call him anything else.'</p>

<p>In an interview with Us Weekly last month, the actress opened up about the new man in her life.</p>

<p>'He's really great. I did good, if I do say so. Definitely hitting out of my league there,' the Minnesota native said.</p>

<p>'I met someone really nice, and I adore him. He's fantastic.'</p>

<p>Cook and Gillies, who announced their split over a year ago after about 15 years of marriage, share two children: daughter Charlotte, six, and son Theodore, five.</p>
