<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United were reportedly close to signing Thiago Alcantara in 2013, but new manager David Moyes opted to sign Marouane Fellaini instead. </p>

<p>Moyes took charge of United seven years ago, after Sir Alex Ferguson retired following 26 successful years at the club. </p>

<p>Ferguson, according to ESPN, had already set a deal in motion to sign Thiago - then at Barcelona - but Moyes reportedly pulled the plug because he did not know enough about the Spanish midfielder, instead buying Fellaini from former club Everton. </p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara could have joined Manchester United in 2013 but joined Bayern Munich</p>

<p>David Moyes instead decided to sign Everton midfielder Marouane Fellaini on deadline-day</p>

<p>Moyes, who signed a six-year contract, did not even last a season as he was sacked in April 2014.  </p>

<p>Thiago instead joined Bayern Munich and has since won seven Bundesliga titles and a few weeks' ago won the Champions League. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old only has a year left on his contract at Bayern and though United are again interested, Thiago is being heavily linked this summer with a move to Premier League champions Liverpool. </p>

<p>Thiago won the Champions League with Bayern but reportedly is set on a new challenge </p>

<p>Fellaini did have a somewhat successful career at Old Trafford, winning an FA Cup, League Cup and Europa League before departing for Shandong Luneng in 2019. </p>

<p>The Belgian was bought on deadline-day by Moyes in a summer window where he also missed out on former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas, as reported by The Sun. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thiago - who is currently on international duty - refused to comment on speculation linking him with a move away. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old Spanish international refused to speculate about his future on Saturday </p>

<p>'I have not told anyone that I'm leaving,' Thiago said on Saturday ahead of Spain's game against Ukraine on Sunday. </p>

<p>'Every year, they put me in a different club. For me my future is tomorrow's game (against Ukraine) and there is nothing more to say. </p>

<p>'I neither care nor am I interested. What interests me is tomorrow'  </p>
