<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A black female politician has been depicted as a slave in chains in a right-wing magazine, sparking a criminal racism inquiry. </p>

<p>Valeurs Actuelles (Current Values) faces prosecution for the seven-page illustrated feature on 40-year-old Danièle Obono.</p>

<p>Ms Obono, who is French-Gabonese, said she was sickened by the cartoon, and branded those responsible as ‘odious, stupid and cruel’.</p>

<p>The feature, titled Obono the African, gives a fictional account of Ms Obono returning to 18th century Africa. </p>

<p>It includes a cartoon where she is pictured with an iron collar around her neck. </p>

<p>Ms Obono, who is French-Gabonese, said she was sickened by the cartoon, and branded those responsible as ‘odious, stupid and cruel’</p>

<p>Following numerous other complaints – including from President Emmanuel Macron – Paris Prosecutor Rémy Heitz on Monday confirmed the opening of a preliminary inquiry for ‘racist insults’. </p>

<p>Ms Obono said the detailed strip cartoon was an example of institutional racism in France.</p>

<p>Describing those responsible as ‘racist s***’, she said: ‘I hurt for my republic, I hurt for my France.’</p>

<p>Ms Obono shared a grab of the cartoon on her Twitter account, Describing those responsible as ‘racist s***’, she said: ‘I hurt for my republic, I hurt for my France'</p>

<p>Ms Obono, who is a member of the France Unbowed party, claimed that the drawing was a political attack on those who fight against ‘the racism and stigmatisation that millions of our compatriots are subjected to’.  </p>

<p>Mr Macron telephoned her personally on Saturday to ‘express his clear condemnation of any form of racism,’ said a spokesman. </p>

<p>The row is a particularly incendiary given that President Macron granted Valeurs Actuelles an interview last year, despite its controversial reputation. </p>

<p>Valeurs Actuelles has defended the cartoon – saying it was part of a ‘summer fiction feature’ in which public figures ‘travel through time’.</p>

<p>Ms Obono said ‘I hurt for my republic, I hurt for my France', in response to the magazine's feature</p>

<p>A statement from the magazine rejected claims that it was racist, but added that it regretted hurting Ms Obono ‘personally’, adding that they ‘apologise to her’. </p>

<p>The row comes five years after millions around the world united under the ‘Je Suis Charlie’ slogan, which called for cartoonists to be given freedom to draw what they liked. </p>

<p>Twelve staff from the satirical Charlie Hebdo magazine were murdered by two Al-Qaeda gunman in Paris after mocking Muslims, and other faiths.   </p>

<p>SOS Racisme, one of France’s biggest anti-racism groups, said Valeurs Actuelles' strip cartoon was typical of the hate speech aimed at ethnic minorities in France. </p>

<p>Prime Minister Jean Castex tweeted: ‘This revolting publication must be unambiguously condemned. The fight against racism will always transcend our differences.’</p>

<p>Mr Macron telephoned her personally on Saturday to ‘express his clear condemnation of any form of racism,’ said a spokesman</p>

<p>Elisabeth Moreno, the junior minister for equality and the only black member of the current French government, said also offered her support to her left-wing parliamentary colleague.</p>

<p>‘I don’t share Danièle Obono’s ideas, but today I offer her all my support,’ said Ms Moreno.</p>

<p>And Richard Ferrand, the leader of the National Assembly, wrote on Twitter: ‘At her side in the fight against racism and for the respect due to all elected representatives of the Republic.’   </p>

<p>Gabon was called the Orunga Kingdom in the 18th Century – a time when tribal leaders regularly sold their own people for profit.</p>

<p>By the 1780s, the country was exporting around 5,000 slaves a year, while also buying humans for its own use in exchange for ivory.</p>

<p>It was not until 1853 that King Ombango-Rogombe of Orunga agreed to finally outlaw slavery for good.</p>

<p>Despite this, the Orungu continued to secretly sell members of their own community, including alleged witches, adulterers and swindlers - many of whom ended up on Portuguese slave ships.</p>

<p>Without the funds provided by the slave trade, the Orungu Kingdom began to fall apart in the late 19th Century, before parts were sold off to French colonisers.</p>

<p>In 1910, Gabon became one of four territories of French Equatorial Africa, before being granted independence exactly 60 years ago, in August 1960.</p>

<p>Previous comic strips in the Valeurs Actuelle summer feature focusing on public figures going back in time have included former Prime Minister Francois Fillon.</p>

<p>Mr Fillon, who was depicted during the French Revolution, was this year convicted of fraud alongside his British-born wife, Penelope Fillon.</p>

<p>President Macron has pledged to fight racism in France, but refuses to remove statues of historical figures associated with the slave trade, as Black Lives Matter activists have campaigned for.</p>
