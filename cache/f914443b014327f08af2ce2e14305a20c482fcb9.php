<p>Earlier this year, ITV producers had rationed shows filmed prior to the coronavirus pandemic as production came to a standstill in March, with the actors left unable to work during the height of the global crisis. </p>

<p>Sources claim thespians, such as Sophie Webster actress Brooke Vincent, 28, and Tina O’Brien (Sarah Platt), 37, have lost a fortune as they haven't been able to earn bonuses for appearing in more episodes and have been forced to live off their basic income. </p>

<p>It is understood that TV icons such as Bill Roache, 88, and Barbara Knox, 87, are the series' top earners as they are fully salaried, whereas the soap's younger actors are on contracts which link their salary to the number of appearances they make.</p>

<p>The Sun claims stars such as Tina, Brooke, Rob Mallard, 28, and Sair Khan, 32, are paid per episode. </p>

<p>An insider told the publication: 'Many of the younger stars have done very well out of this way of doing things for a long time — but now Covid has hammered them.</p>

<p>'When the number of shows per week was slashed because production was halted, they all lost out and are now pushing producers to agree to a new way of doing things.</p>

<p>'And some have told their agents they may consider walking if their income can’t be guaranteed. It has become very heated on both sides. Actors want to know their living is secured — and ITV don’t want to pay people for more than they have actually done. It’s very difficult.'</p>

<p>The source also alleged that executives will revisit each castmembers' contract when they expire, including long-running actress Samia Longchambon's agreement, 38.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted an ITV spokesperson and representatives for Brooke, Tina, Sair, Rob and Samia for further comment.</p>

<p>Bosses were recently forced to reschedule production after a member of the cast tested positive for Covid-19 after being on set earlier this month.</p>

<p>The long-running soap, which resumed filming in June, had to briefly shut down certain areas of the set for a deep clean, after the coronavirus positive actor had filmed scenes.</p>

<p>It has been reported that although certain areas were closed down it did not affect filming due to the soap's two-metre distancing rules.</p>

<p>MailOnline understood that filming was slightly rescheduled due to the actor's absence on set as they isolate at home. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the ITV soap said: 'We can confirm a member of the Coronation Street team has tested positive for coronavirus. The protocols we have in place for such an eventuality have been implemented and the individual is now self isolating at home. </p>

<p>'Although we do not believe anyone has been within 2m of the individual, as a precaution, the production team who were working with the individual have been notified.</p>

<p>'In keeping with health and safety guidance, we have also undertaken an intensive clean of touch points in the cohort area where the individual was working and areas of the building they visited. </p>

<p>The representative for the soap also confirmed filmed continued after the situation was contained following an extensive clean in the targeted area. </p>
