<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boxing legends Chris Eubank and David Haye teamed up yesterday to save a woman after she was hit by a car.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old former super-middleweight champ was joined by Haye, 39, after the victim was knocked down by a motor in London.</p>

<p>Eubank played down any suggestion he was a hero - insisting he had just been down his civic duty.</p>

<p>But he did not hesitate when a Mercedes, not connected to either fighter, injured the woman.</p>

<p>He said: 'My friend and I did our civic duty when I stopped my car to attend a lady who had been hit by another car.</p>

<p>'We promptly stopped to ensure she was safe and well.</p>

<p>'We both wish her a speedy recovery.'</p>

<p>Eubank can be seen crouching near to the injured lady as she tries to get back to her feet</p>

<p>The boxers waited until the woman was reached by ambulance crews they flagged down</p>

<p>Video posted publicly online shows him standing near the crash victim and helping her look for her mobile phone.</p>

<p>It was then as he tried to get emergency crews to stop he was joined by Haye at the scene on Victoria Embankment.</p>

<p>He told The Sun: 'I was the first to get there and I comforted her on the floor.</p>

<p>“David happened to be walking by at the same time and asked ‘can I help too’. We believe the girl is ok.”</p>

<p>Team-up: David Haye and Chris Eubank were both on the scene to help the injured woman</p>

<p>“Her mobile phone had been knocked out of her hand and had fallen under a car.</p>

<p>“I got on all fours and went under the car - I found it - I was frightened somebody may run it over.”</p>

<p>Haye added that he had been coming back from a meeting when he saw the crash and came over to try and help.</p>

<p>It is not clear whether the police were involved in the incident. </p>
