<p>'We haven't just lost a daughter, we've lost a best friend and a sister,' Mr Ireland said on the front lawn of their Adelaide home.</p>

<p>'We've lost our baby girl and we miss her beyond what any words can describe. Our hearts will forever remain broken.'</p>

<p>Her cousin Savannah Ireland explained the devastating impact Chelsea's death had on the entire family.</p>

<p>'I don't have many tears left now. There was such a loss here for me and so many other people,' she said in an Instagram video.</p>

<p>Consoled by Chelsea's older sister Maddie, 22, Mr and Mrs Ireland said they were comforted to know the impact their daughter had on those she knew.</p>

<p>'It brings comfort to know Chelsea's kind and caring heart and bright smile has left a lasting impression on people she met,' Mr Ireland said.</p>

<p>'Chelsea was compassionate, strong, selfless and fearless and continues to make us proud every day.'</p>

<p>Mrs Ireland spoke of her daughter's passion for the environment that led her to study mechanical engineering at Adelaide University.</p>

<p>'She was going to change the world with her recycling, reusing and saving the planet, and climate change. She had great plans,' she said.</p>

<p>'She had so many different sides to her — she was strong, fearless, passionate, determined, opinionated, but then she had such a beautiful, kind heart and gentle soul and really just saw the best in everybody.'</p>

<p>Mrs Ireland told of how when she was just 15 years old, Chelsea watched a YouTube video that inspired her to donate her waist-length brown locks to cancer patients.</p>

<p>The hair, along with a donation of $1,000, was given to the Royal Adelaide Hospital's wig recycling and loan service in 2015 and went on to be a wig for a cancer patient.</p>

<p>She went on to volunteer at Puddle Jumpers Incorporated, caring for vulnerable children and young people.</p>

<p>Lukasz (left) was with Chelsea (right) at her older sister Maddie's (centre) 21st birthday party a year ago as he became part of the Ireland family</p>

<p>Chelsea's father said they 'were an amazing couple, they were just best buddies, they had shared a love of music together'</p>

<p>Lukasz shared her passion, with the couple buying their families metal straws and reusable bread and fruit bags and planning to buy a Tesla when they were older.</p>

<p>Chelsea's father also grieved for Lukasz who 'brought smiles to our faces and laughter' to their home and was becoming part of their family.</p>

<p>'They were an amazing couple, they were just best buddies, they had shared a love of music together,' he said. </p>

<p>Savannah Ireland tearfully recalled how she woke up the morning after the shooting to her brother telling her Chelsea and Lukasz were both dead. </p>

<p>'Chelsea was the most beautiful thing on the planet, and she was going to make big things happen and create so much magic,' she said. </p>

<p>'She made people feel capable in their own skin. I just know she was going to do beautiful things, and that makes it really hard. </p>

<p>'Chelsea wanted to leave this world more beautiful than when she arrived in it. She was so unapologetically and authentically herself and that was something I always admired about her.'</p>

<p>Lukasz's father Paul Kłosowski, 46, (pictured) is charged with two counts of murder for allegedly killing his estranged son and his son's girlfriend</p>

<p>Lukasz was studying journalism at the University of South Australia while working at KFC, a job he and his friends made numerous jokes about. </p>

<p>He had barely seen his father since Kłosowski's relationship with his mother Magdalena broke down about 2005. </p>

<p>Photos of Lukasz about that time show him with his mother, and another clutching a decoration reading 'Sto Lat (Happy Birthday) Lukasz'. </p>

<p>Family friends said Magdalena limited contact between her ex-husband and her son, and later started dating a woman she is still in a relationship with.</p>

<p>Kłosowski and Lukasz only occasionally crossed paths until recent years when he tried to mend fences after marrying his wife Monica.</p>

<p>However, Kłosowski noted his son's absence from numerous family photos with his three stepchildren and called him 'stubborn'. </p>

<p>Lukasz and Chelsea travelled from their Adelaide home for a family visit at their rural property near Millicent. </p>

<p>Mount Gambier Magistrates' Court heard that two of Kłosowski's stepchildren, both aged under 14, were present for the family gathering and witnessed the shooting.</p>

<p>Kłosowski's social media profiles show he worked as a truck driver and was a Harley Davidson and gun enthusiast, with a .303 rifle seen in one photo.  </p>

<p>He appeared in court last week and did not apply for bail. He will face court again in December.</p>
