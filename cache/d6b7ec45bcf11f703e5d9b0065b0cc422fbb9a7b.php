<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you’re going to press Arsenal, then you need to be good at it, otherwise they can punish you. So West Ham need to be wary when they face the Gunners on Saturday night. </p>

<p>Three of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s most recent strikes are examples of how to go from goalkeeper to goal. They did it against Manchester City in the FA Cup. Then against Liverpool in the Community Shield. Then against Fulham in last weekend’s Premier League opener.</p>

<p>It’s proof of Mikel Arteta’s work on the training ground. No side in Europe stole the ball in the final third more than Liverpool in 2019-20. But Arsenal got around their press in the Community Shield — despite Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah and James Milner being in their box.</p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's goal against Liverpool in the Community Shield was well worked and has been a familiar sight in the past few weeks </p>

<p>Hector Bellerin's involvement is important and he looks for Bukayo Saka in possession </p>

<p>When the keeper gets the ball, Granit Xhaka and Mohamed Elneny are on the edge of his 18-yard box in front of him. David Luiz is to the left of his six-yard box and Rob Holding to the right. Kieran Tierney, the third centre back in Arsenal’s 3-4-3, is on the left wing offering another out-ball.</p>

<p>They then proceed to pass it out — confidently — knowing that these are all of their options.</p>

<p>The two midfielders don’t look to take the ball and turn into traffic. They’re there to bounce it back to the centre backs.</p>

<p>Elneny passes to Holding, who plays the ball on to Hector Bellerin. Bellerin’s ball over the opposition line finds Bukayo Saka, and when it’s switched to Aubameyang, with the exceptional form he’s in, you’re expecting the goal.</p>

<p>The moment the Arsenal striker shoots to score against Liverpool, you can see left wing back Ainsley Maitland-Niles underlapping and left-sided centre back Tierney overlapping. That is no mistake.</p>

<p>Ainsley Maitland-Niles makes an overlapping run to take defenders away from Aubameyang</p>

<p>It was the same against Fulham. Willian switches to Aubameyang, Maitland-Niles underlaps, Tierney overlaps, and the Premier League’s deadliest marksman finds the top corner.</p>

<p>They can act as decoy runs, or runs in which they receive the ball, but they make Arsenal so tricky to deal with down the left side. There are different rules on the right wing.</p>

<p>Holding doesn’t fly forward as often as Tierney does. On one of the occasions he did at Craven Cottage, however, it led to a goal.</p>

<p>Alexandre Lacazette couldn’t help laughing after Holding’s Dennis Bergkamp-esque juggling of the ball won a corner, but the subsequent cross saw Gabriel head in.</p>

<p>This is a well-drilled Arsenal side — as organised as I’ve seen them in recent times. Even when taking a throw-in on the right wing, there is a routine. Bellerin takes it, Elneny is parallel and Holding deep. Willian then drops deep enough so that his marker feels reluctant to follow and receives the ball.</p>

<p>This is the extent of organisation that has been instilled in these players by Arteta.</p>

<p>David Moyes has never won an away game at Arsenal.</p>

<p>In 19 attempts, he’s managed four draws and 15 defeats. In a bid to bag his first win, he may start Michail Antonio up front, just as he did against Newcastle at the London Stadium last week.</p>

<p>Moyes’ club managed 30 crosses in that 2-0 home defeat — the second most of any Premier League side — and Antonio was responsible for six of those, the most of any West Ham player.</p>

<p>Michail Antonio needs to be causing havoc in the box rather than crossing it in </p>

<p>Even if Tomas Soucek is breaking from midfield to get on the end of them, you do not want your striker to be the one crossing the ball. You want him in the box competing for the header.</p>

<p>Antonio, who ended last season with eight goals in seven games, is a mobile attacker but Moyes will want him to stay more central. The Scot is not a manager who panics, despite losing his opening match.</p>

<p>Moyes knew his team would have the majority of the ball against Newcastle, but that won’t happen at the Emirates tonight.</p>

<p>Arsenal let in 15 goals from set pieces last season, so that might be how West Ham try to hurt them, along with trying to get at the hosts on the counter.</p>

<p>ln the below pitch graphics show three counter-attack goals that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has scored recently for Arsenal. The stopwatches show the time it took from Arsenal’s first pass to Aubameyang scoring.</p>

<p>All three of the goals start with Arsenal pushed back in their own penalty area and in each of them the Gunners beat the opposition’s high press and escape danger by calmly passing it out from the back.</p>

<p>Then Arsenal break at speed and all three moves are finished by the brilliant Aubameyang (with the yellow ring around him in the graphics) doing what he does best — scoring goals.</p>

<p>One key reason behind Arsenal being able to do this is that their midfielders (whether it be Granit Xhaka, Dani Ceballos or Mohamed Elneny) drop deep to offer themselves as central options to the goalkeeper and at the same time the centre backs make sure that they are wide of the six-yard box.</p>
