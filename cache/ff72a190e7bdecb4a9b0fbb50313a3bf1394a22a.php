<p>Back in April, Laura revealed she would be moving back to Scotland permanently after lockdown is over, due to feeling lonely in the English capital. </p>

<p>Speaking to Vas J Morgan for his I AM ENOUGH podcast in August, Laura said she had made some big decisions during the lockdown period and told the former TOWIE star said: 'I have decided to move to Scotland because I want to buy a flat.</p>

<p>'I just moved here after Love Island and obviously it's been almost two years now.</p>

<p>'I have been renting my whole life, wasting all my money and I just think it is so expensive in London and I'm quite lonely here, I don't know that many people.</p>

<p>'I've always wanted to wait to meet a guy and buy a house and I think 'no I want to buy a flat myself'.</p>
