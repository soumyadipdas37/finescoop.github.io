<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rep. Ilhan Omar hit back at comments President Donald Trump made at his Tuesday night Pittsburgh rally, suggesting the U.S. wasn't her country, calling the MAGA gatherings 'cult-like.' </p>

<p> 'Firstly, this is my country and I am a member of the House that impeached you,' the Minnesota Democrat tweets. 'Secondly, I fled civil war when I was 8. An 8-year-old doesn't run a country even though you run our country like one.'  </p>

<p>At the rally Tuesday, Trump brought up the so-called 'squad' member and told the crowd, 'She's telling us how to run our country. How did you do where you came from?' </p>

<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar hit back at Trump tweeting, 'this is my country,' and she also suggested that he ran the U.S. like an 8-year-old, the age she fled the Somalian civil war </p>

<p>Rep. Ilhan Omar reacted to President Donald Trump's racist barbs by calling his rallies 'cult-like' and sharing a 'Mean Girls' GIF </p>

<p>Omar, who's an American citizen, was born in Somalia. </p>

<p>'How was your country doing?' Trump said. 'She's telling us how to run our country,' the president said again. </p>

<p>The Trump campaign has been targeting Minnesota as being flippable, with the president saying Omar was playing a part. </p>

<p> 'We're going to win the state of Minnesota because of her, they say,' Trump told the crowd. </p>

<p>Omar pushed back at the racist comments with a few insults of her own and a meme. </p>

<p>'These cult-like rallies leave me wondering one thing,' the freshman congresswoman tweeted. </p>

<p>Omar then included GIF of Regina George's character in 'Mean Girls' asking Lindsay Lohan's Cady Heron, 'Why are you so obsessed with me?' </p>

<p>During his hour and a half in Pittsburgh, Trump also mocked Omar's 'squad'-mate, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for her 'green new deal.' </p>

<p>'She's not a good student, but she's got a good line of crap,' Trump said </p>

<p>The president also laughed about reporters experiencing violence while covering this summer's protests.</p>

<p>Trump misremembered an incident involving MSNBC's Ali Velshi, who was hit by a rubber bullet, as opposed to 'hit with a canister of tear gas,' as the president recalled. 'Remember that beautiful sight?' he said of Velshi being hit. </p>

<p>The president also joyfully recounted a journalist being targeted by police. </p>

<p>'Sometimes they grab. They grab one guy. "I'm a reporter. I'm a reporter." Get out of here. They threw him aside like he was a little bag of popcorn,' Trump said. 'Honestly, when you watch the crap that we have all had to take so long. When you see it it is actually a beautiful sight.' </p>

<p>But Trump mostly targeted his political rival, Democrat Joe Biden, who he made fun of for wearing a mask, floated had plastic surgery and suggested was on drugs. </p>
