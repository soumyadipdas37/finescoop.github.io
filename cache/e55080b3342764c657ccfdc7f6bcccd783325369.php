<p>Honour: Halle Berry has joined the likes of Mariah Carey and Lewis Hamilton to honour Breonna Taylor, who was shot dead by Louisville Metro Police Department as they served a no-knock warrant at her home in March</p>

<p>The T-shirt is created by the Phenomenal Woman Action Campaign in partnership with the Breonna Taylor Foundation with all profits going to the latter.    </p>

<p>The three officers who fired their weapons that night have been at the centre of consistent public backlash, with protesters calling for them to be fired and charged with murder. </p>

<p>One of the officers, Brett Hankison, was fired for 'blindly' firing 10 shots into Taylor's apartment from outside. The other two, John Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, remain on the force on administrative assignment.</p>

<p>Posting a picture of her T-shirt from the front and back, Halle wrote alongside her photo: 'It has been 6 months since first-responder #BreonnaTaylor was murdered in her home, asleep in her bed. </p>

<p>On track: The Formula One World Champion also posted a snap wearing the T-shirt on the track at the Tuscan Grand Prix</p>

<p>While Lewis captioned his photo with: '#JusticeForBreonnaTaylor ✊'.</p>

<p>The Formula One World Champion also posted a snap wearing the T-shirt on the track at the Tuscan Grand Prix. </p>

<p>He penned: 'It's been 6 months since Breonna Taylor was murdered by policemen, in her own home. Still no justice has been served. We won't stay silent. #JusticeForBreonnaTaylor.'  </p>

<p>Although Lewis now faces an FIA investigation for wearing a 'political' T-shirt at Sunday's Tuscan Grand Prix.</p>

<p>He wore the T-shirt during the 'taking a knee' ceremony and on the podium as God Save the Queen played to celebrate his 90th career win. </p>

<p>Warrant: Breonna and her boyfriend Kenneth Walker had been sleeping in bed when the officers served the warrant at around 1am. </p>

<p>The Kentucky Attorney General is still investigating the killing, which has led to riots in America, so Lewis' intervention is seen by several senior F1 figures as being potentially 'political'. FIA statutes forbid political statements of any kind.</p>

<p>Lewis could be fined, with one official privately indicating to Sportsmail the Mercedes man had 'crossed a line'.</p>

<p>The FIA and the sport's owners Liberty Media have previously tried hard to work with him on his anti-racism fight.</p>

<p>On the night of Breonna's death, officers attended her apartment after securing a court-approved warrant as part of a drugs investigation that allowed officers to enter her home without any prior warning.</p>

<p>The suspect at the centre of the probe had apparently lived at the same address years earlier and continued to receive packages there.</p>

<p>Mr Walker, a licensed gun owner, had fired a shot in the direction of the doorway, thinking the couple were victims of a home invasion.</p>

<p>The shot struck Sergeant Mattingly in the leg before Officer Hankinson returned fire, discharging his weapon in the direction of Walker 10 times.</p>

<p>Mr Mattingly and Mr Cosgrove also opened fire. Ms Taylor was hit eight times and pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>'Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend,' a frantic Mr Walker told dispatchers in a 911 call.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the officers at their home, the suspect they were searching for had been taken into custody hours earlier in a separate location.</p>

<p>Breonna's death received national attention two months later, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minnesota police in May.</p>

<p>The three officers who fired their weapons that night have been at the centre of consistent public backlash ever since, with protesters calling for them to be fired and charged with murder.</p>

<p>Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black emergency medical technician, was fatally shot by Louisville Metro Police Department (LMPD) officers Jonathan Mattingly, Brett Hankison, and Myles Cosgrove on March 13, 2020.</p>

<p>Three plainclothes LMPD officers entered her apartment in Louisville, Kentucky, executing a no-knock search warrant (although, according to the police account and witnesses present at the scene, the officers nonetheless knocked before forcing entry).</p>

<p>Gunfire was exchanged between Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker and the officers. Walker said that he believed that the officers were intruders. The LMPD officers fired over twenty shots. Taylor was shot eight times and LMPD Sergeant Jonathan Mattingly was injured by gunfire. Another police officer and an LMPD lieutenant were on the scene when the warrant was executed.</p>

<p>The primary targets of the LMPD investigation were Jamarcus Glover and Adrian Walker, who were suspected of selling controlled substances from a drug house more than 10 miles away. According to a Taylor family attorney, Glover had dated Taylor two years before and continued to have a 'passive friendship'.</p>

<p>The search warrant included Taylor's residence because it was suspected that Glover received packages containing drugs at Taylor's apartment and because a car registered to Taylor had been seen parked on several occasions in front of Glover's house. No drugs were found in the apartment.</p>

<p>Kenneth Walker, who was licensed to carry a firearm, fired first, injuring a law enforcement officer, whereupon police returned fire into the apartment with more than 20 rounds.</p>

<p>A wrongful death lawsuit filed against the police by the Taylor family's attorney alleges that the officers, who entered Taylor's home 'without knocking and without announcing themselves as police officers', opened fire 'with a total disregard for the value of human life'. However, according to the police account, the officers did knock and announce themselves before forcing entry.</p>

<p>A New York Times investigation confirmed from interviews with Kenneth Walker and with Taylor's neighbours that the police had knocked loudly before breaking in, but most had not heard them announce themselves.</p>
