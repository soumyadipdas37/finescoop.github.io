<p>Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo is set to be awarded his coaching badges on Monday</p>

<p>Pirlo and Cristiano Ronaldo are preparing for the first Serie A match of the season v Sampdoria</p>

<p>Usually, any potential manager has to already have their coaching badges before taking over at a professional club but an exemption for Pirlo had been made as he had already started the course when Juventus offered him the managerial vacancy.</p>

<p>His predecessor Sarri was sacked after their shock Champions League last-16 exit to Lyon, despite guiding Juve to their ninth straight Serie A title.</p>

<p>Pirlo, who played for Juve for four years from 2011, has underlined his desire to bring in a striker in time for the curtain-raising match on Sunday.</p>

<p>Speaking after a 5-0 friendly win over Novara, Pirlo said: 'Yes, I need a striker as soon as possible, but the transfer market is long and closes on October 5.'</p>

<p>Juventus have been linked with Luis Suarez, Moise Kean and Edin Dzeko. </p>

<p>Pirlo is eager to sign a striker before he begins life as Juvenuts manager this weekend </p>
