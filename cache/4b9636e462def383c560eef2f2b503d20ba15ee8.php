<p>But there's one particular room in the St Ives home on Flinders Street that's turning heads.</p>

<p>The $5million dollar mansion also boasts one of the best man caves in Australia complete with it's own elevator to the rest of the house.</p>

<p>The $4.9million dollar mansion on Sydney's north shore boasts one of the best man caves in Australia (pictured) </p>

<p>The sitting room with fishing gear and indoor plants was set up in the home's six-car garage and even has its own elevator </p>

<p>David Walker, from Ray White Real Estate, says the buyer will likely be a luxury car owner who appreciates the large garage </p>

<p>The man cave was set up in the home's six-car garage after a lengthy battle with the local council.     </p>

<p>'It's very difficult in Ku-Ring-Gai to get that sort of garage space approved, so the over-sized garage and man cave is actually quite rare,' the man tasked with selling the prestigious home, David Walker, from Ray White Real Estate told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'It took the owner over 12 months to get it approved so it's unique to be able to buy such a great house with the garage space to boot.'</p>

<p>Mr Walker said whoever buys the luxurious home which goes under the hammer on Saturday September 19, is likely to be someone with a collection of high-end cars.  </p>

<p>Three-storey home on Flinders Street in St Ives goes up for auction on September 19 with large crowd expected to turn out </p>

<p>The guide price for the mansion which is only a stone's throw from Sydney's Northern Beaches is about $4.9million </p>

<p>After three weeks on display 142 groups have viewed the home. Pictured: The spectacular Italian-tiled pool </p>

<p>'The buyer will be someone who wants a place to escape to and is looking for a place to store their luxury cars,' he said.</p>

<p>Despite the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Walker said when it comes to these type of homes, there is still a 'strong amount of interest'.</p>

<p>The guide for the property is about $4.9million and so far, after just three weeks on show, 142 groups have viewed the home.  </p>

<p>'COVID hasn't really seemed to affect luxury house sales much at all,' he said. </p>

<p>'The people with this sort of money to spend are not worried about losing their jobs and if anything they're really taking the opportunity to capitalise on low interest rates.'</p>

<p>'So in this environment it is actually a good time to upgrade.' </p>

<p>For the lady of the house, there are also custom built-in wardrobes, stone top benches, a freestanding bath and an array of entertaining space both indoors and out.</p>
