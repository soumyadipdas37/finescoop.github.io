<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who casually watched a video on her phone while driving and laughed about it when caught out is facing a $533 fine after police tracked her down.</p>

<p>The Queenslander, 25, from Broadbeach, was filmed by a passenger of another vehicle watching her phone on the car's dashboard while perched up over the steering wheel.</p>

<p>She was travelling from Bermuda St at Burleigh Waters to Bundall - about 9km away - with the phone seemingly blocking her view of the car's speedometer.</p>

<p>Witness Jayden Barta, who filmed the incident, said he was 'appalled' by her behaviour.</p>

<p>The Queenslander, 25, from Broadbeach, was filmed by a passenger of another car watching her phone on the car's dashboard while perched up over the steering wheel (pictured)</p>

<p>She appeared to be distracted by her phone for more than 5km, he told Nine News.  </p>

<p>'When she looked at us she just laughed and kept going on - her eyes glued to the screen,' he said.</p>

<p>'You're not only putting yourself in that much danger, you're putting everyone else in danger.' </p>

<p>Police were able to track the woman down after Mr Barta passed his recording onto Crimestoppers.</p>

<p>Witness Jayden Barta (pictured), of the other vehicle, said he was 'appalled' by her behaviour</p>

<p>She was located within less than 24 hours and will face a $533 fine.</p>

<p>Drivers in Queensland travelling without due care and attention risk being fined this amount.</p>

<p>Queensland Police officer Geoff Sheldon told Nine News: 'Anything that takes your attention off the road has the capability of killing someone.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia reached out to Mr Barta for comment. </p>
