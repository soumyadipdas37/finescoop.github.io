<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the incredible moment a photographer came across a stag that appeared to be waiting on a platform for a train.</p>

<p>John McGowan, who runs Strictly Highland Photography, spotted the animal at Achnasheen Railway Station in Scotland on September 7.</p>

<p>In the video, the stag is seen wandering up the platform, as if waiting for the next train to arrive.</p>

<p>A stag wanders up the platform at Achnasheen Railway Station in Scotland on September 7, as if waiting for the next train</p>

<p>Seemingly having grown impatient, the stag then hops over a wire fence and starts trotting down the road.</p>

<p>The animal only stops to look back when John leaves the station and starts to follow it.</p>

<p>John was lucky to have come across the stag, having only stopped at the train station to use their facilities.</p>

<p>After seemingly growing tired of waiting, the stag decides to hope over a wire fence and make its journey on foot</p>

<p>The stag wanders down the road from the station before slowly looking back at photographer John McGowan who follows it for a time</p>

<p>The video was published onto the Strictly Highland Photography Facebook page later that day.</p>

<p>The caption alongside the video said: 'This morning, our commute took us to the Isle of Skye on assignment.</p>

<p>'We stopped off at Achnasheen Station to let the team make the most of the facilities.</p>

<p>'While there, I noticed that there was only one gentleman at the shelter waiting for the arrival of the train. I'm sure he didn't mind me filming him.'</p>
