<p>A woman has revealed how her clever husband invented a McDonald's Big Mac kebab (pictured) by using similar ingredients as the popular fast food burger</p>

<p>Posting to a popular Australian cookery group, the woman shared images along with the simple recipe to make the homemade kebab</p>

<p>The McDonald's Big Mac burgers have two 100 per cent Australian beef patties between three bread buns with the McDonald's sauce, cheese, lettuce, onions and pickles. </p>

<p>To make the unique but similar tasting kebab, the woman's husband mixed mince meat with sausage mince and barbecue seasoning for flavour.</p>

<p>He combined the meat to make a large, round loaf which was cooked in the oven for 40 minutes at 180 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>Once the meat was cooked it was wrapped in Lebanese bread with cheese, Heinz special burger sauce and lettuce. </p>

<p>Any type of minced meat can be used depending on personal taste, but beef or lamb is best in order to replicate the flavour of the Big Mac as close as possible. </p>
