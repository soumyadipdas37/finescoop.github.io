<p>A furious mother attacked a teacher who was allegedly caught on CCTV assaulting children at a nursery in Thailand</p>

<p>When they checked the CCTV again, the horrified parents saw the teacher banging the students' heads on their desks, twisting their ears until they cry, and locking them in the toilet.</p>

<p>A school meeting was held with the parents on September 24 and the teacher admitted manhandling the children.</p>

<p>However, the angry mob of parents attacked the teacher while the other staff tried to calm them down.</p>

<p>Regional police commander Ampon Buarabporn said a court summons has already been issued for the teacher.</p>

<p>'If any of the children are found to be mentally affected, investigators will issue more charges against the teacher.''</p>
