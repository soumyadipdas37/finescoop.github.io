<p>The Marquess of Worcester stands to inherit his father's estimated £315 million fortune, which includes the 52,000-acre estate in Gloucestershire.

<p>Bunter Beaufort, the father of the groom, married journalist Georgia Powell two years ago after divorcing his eco-crusader wife Tracy.</p>

<p>Family friend Taki, the indefatigable playboy, assures me that whatever the wedding may have lacked in numbers, it will have made up for in style.</p>

<p>'You never have a bad time at Badminton,' he tells me.</p>

<p>'It was fun under Bunter's father and it was certainly fun last year at the ball Bunter gave,' adds Taki, who has known Bobby since he was born</p>
