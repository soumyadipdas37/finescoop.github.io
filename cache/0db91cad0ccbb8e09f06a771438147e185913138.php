<p>It's back! Jeopardy! has unveiled its updated set and new procedures amid the coronavirus pandemic as the game show returns to TV screens on Monday</p>

<p>Fans of the longtime show can still expect to see Alex Trebek, 80, host this upcoming season amid his battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. </p>

<p>Johnny Gilbert, 96, who announces the contestants and introduces Trebek, will not be in the studio and will record the intros from his home.</p>

<p>Trebek said of the changes, 'We have done the same thing for our staff and crew. We’re trying to provide as safe an environment as possible as we produce these new programs for your enjoyment,'</p>

<p>Returning champion Zach Newkirk will eventually be returning but not for the first few weeks because of travel restrictions.</p>

<p>Jeopardy! G.O.A.T. Ken Jennings is returning in a consulting producer role.</p>

<p>Updated: A short promotional video for season 37 shows spaced out podiums to keep contestants six feet apart as part of a set of new protocols to keep everyone safe in the studio</p>

<p>Safety first: Producers and writers are seen wearing masks</p>

<p>Jennings, the record-setting contestant who won on 74 straight shows and took the Jeopardy! The Greatest of All Time title earlier this year told GMA on Monday: 'I kind of feel like I have a unique perspective on Jeopardy!. I’ve been a fan of the show for over 35 years now, it’s a huge part of my life growing up. And then for the last 15 years, seeing the show as a contestant,'</p>

<p>Jennings, 46, will be presenting video categories and working with writers on clues and will also be involved with casting which is now virtual.</p>

<p>The beloved quiz show made the exciting announcement about Jennings return earlier this month.</p>

<p>'Mic check, one, two. Can you hear us, <?php echo e('@'); ?>Ken Jennings?' its Twitter account shared with an accompanying promotional video.</p>

<p>New era: There will also be a skeleton staff and no studio audience for filming</p>

<p>Making it happen: All the equipment is cleaned thoroughly</p>

<p>Fans of the longtime show can still expect to see Alex Trebek, 80, host this upcoming season amid his battle with stage 4 pancreatic cancer</p>

<p>First look: A glimpse at the set was unveiled on Monday ahead of the premiere of season 37</p>

<p>In the January face-off, he walked away with a $1 million prize after defeating fellow champions James Holzhauer and Brad Rutter. He's won around $4.4 million in Jeopardy prizes. </p>

<p>Jeopardy! resumed filming last month after pandemic restrictions halted production in California, where cases skyrocketed during the summer and 12,800 new cases were recorded on July 21.</p>

<p>Trebek said last month that he's responding exceptionally well to treatment for pancreatic cancer and expects to mark his two-year survival next February.</p>

<p>The Twitter account for Jeopardy! revealed a promotional video and announced Ken Jennings' new role earlier this month</p>

<p>He was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in March 2019 and continued to update his fans on his health journey.</p>

<p>The famed host admitted that his journey hasn't been easy and he's battled with bouts of 'great depression' through the process.</p>

<p>He remained optimistic about reaching two years of recovery, though, with support from his wife and 'soulmate' Jean, in addition to the 'millions of prayers' sent from well-wishers around the world.</p>
