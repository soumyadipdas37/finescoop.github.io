<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>France recorded almost 10,000 new COVID-19 infections today, its highest ever single-day total, as hospitalisations also begin to rise. </p>

<p>Health authorities reported 9,843 new confirmed coronavirus cases, beating by almost 900 the previous record of 8,975, set six days earlier.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the month, new cases have gone up by 7,292 each day on average, a figure that blows away the previous record daily average of 3,003 seen in August.</p>

<p>After reaching a low of 4,530 on 28 August, the number of people hospitalised with COVID-19 is again trending upward, with an increase of 93 over the last 24 hours to 5,096, the highest total in more than a month.</p>

<p>The rise in infections has mainly affected young people who are less likely to develop complications from the virus.  </p>

<p>Doctors and nurses wearing protective gear take care of a patient suffering from the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at the resuscitation intensive care unit (ICU) of the Hopital Europeen hospital in Marseille, France today</p>

<p>There has so far been less strain on French hospitals, which were almost overwhelmed at the end of March. </p>

<p>The number of hospitalisations have now shot up for 12 days in a row. The number of patients in intensive care units stands at 615, a level unseen since the end of June.</p>

<p>Hospital figures are still very far from peaks reached in April but create renewed strain on the hospital system that might lead authorities to take action.</p>

<p>France's decision to put the country under one of Europe's strictest lockdowns between March 17 and May 11 was dictated by the need to keep the hospital system from being overwhelmed.</p>

<p>The number of people in France who have died from COVID-19 infections increased by 19, to 30,813. </p>

<p>Thursday's figure is lower than the 30+ figure reported in the previous two days but still above the seven-day moving average of 15.</p>

<p>France has the seventh-highest COVID-19 death toll in the world. </p>
