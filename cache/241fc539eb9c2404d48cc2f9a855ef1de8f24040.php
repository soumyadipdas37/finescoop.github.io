<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bryson DeChameau has been crowned the 2020 US Open champion, finally earning the chance to silence his doubters. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old distanced American debutant Matt Wolff by six points on Sunday, with Louis Oosthuizen eight shots back in third.  </p>

<p>There was plenty to ponder from New York as Sportsmail's Derek Lawrenson looks at the six things we learned from the tournament. </p>

<p>Bryson DeChameau was crowned US Open champion for 2020 on Sunday in New York </p>

<p>Only Patrick Reed could get barracked at an event where no fans were allowed. </p>

<p>That didn’t prevent some homeowners erecting platforms in back yards overlooking some of the holes — and they gave the controversial Reed both barrels. </p>

<p>If ever there was a player secretly thrilled at the absence of 40,000 bloodthirsty New Yorkers, it was him.</p>

<p>Even without crowds by the course Patrick Reed couldn't escape his controversial reputation</p>

<p>Even through the darkest days, when he couldn’t get out of bed owing to his back problems, the mantra was always the same — write off Tiger Woods at your peril. </p>

<p>Yet here goes. When it comes to the US Open, his days as a contender are done. </p>

<p>The only majors he can win now are the next two or three editions of the Masters and the 2022 Open at St Andrews.</p>

<p>A feisty reference on social media as to how few fairways Matt Wolff hit over the first 54 holes showed that Lee Westwood is still up for the fight. </p>

<p>Now 47, he would probably have been making a record-equalling 11th Ryder Cup appearance this week. </p>

<p>Maybe he will make it next year. And he’s a good each-way bet for the Masters in November.</p>

<p>Lee Westwood, the 47-year-old veteran, showed he still has his fighting spirit at Mamaroneck</p>

<p>A highly-respected coach was having a go at people having a go at Jordan Spieth last week — but who is putting the boot in with regard to the Texan? </p>

<p>I don’t know a single person in golf who is not willing him to find a way through his current mental maze and recapture his form.</p>

<p>After the sluggers Matt Wolff and Bryson DeChambeau did after three rounds what you are not supposed to be able to do at a US Open, and score well from the rough, the next step in the distance insight project promised by the game’s governing bodies should make interesting reading next March. </p>

<p>A prediction: there will be blood.</p>

<p>Bryson DeChambeau has continued to upset the traditionalists with his performances </p>

<p>It Is not often I disagree with Ewen Murray on Sky Sports but I’ll happily take issue with his preference for the birdie-fest on day one over the spills on day two.</p>

<p>If you see 20 scores under par at a US Open, it means the set-up is a betrayal of what the event is supposed to represent. </p>

<p>It makes it indistinguishable from a top PGA Tour event.</p>
