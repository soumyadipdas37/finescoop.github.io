<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two young brothers were forced to live alongside their mother's corpse inside their Texas home for a week after she died of a suspected heart attack and they were unable to call for help. </p>

<p>Police found the two boys, aged five and seven, fending for themselves inside their home in Talty, east of Dallas, on Sunday.</p>

<p>The boys' mother, 71-year-old Connie Taylor, was found dead inside the home. </p>

<p>Taylor had officially adopted the boys last month after initially being their foster mother.   </p>

<p>The brothers have not been identified.  </p>

<p>Police found the two boys, aged five and seven, fending for themselves inside their home in Talty, east of Dallas, on Monday after their mother Connie Taylor collapsed and died</p>

<p>The boys were only found after authorities were called out to the home to carry out a welfare check after they failed to show up at their nearby elementary school for a week. </p>

<p>Police said the boys opened the door for officers and told them their mother was 'passed out' on the floor and wouldn't wake up. </p>

<p>The boys said they had tried to use Taylor's cellphone to call for help but they didn't know the password to unlock it. </p>

<p>They also said they didn't know their neighbors and were too scared to go outside. </p>

<p>Police said the boys fended for themselves for a week by eating food from the pantry and refrigerator. </p>

<p>A neighbor told DFW CBS that the boys had gone into 'survival mode'.</p>

<p>Teachers in the Forney Independent School District (above) had become concerned when the boys hadn't shown up for class since September 21</p>

<p>'They thought mum was asleep and the police officers were going to be able to wake her up,' the neighbor said.  </p>

<p>Teachers in the Forney Independent School District had become concerned when the boys hadn't shown up for class since September 21. </p>

<p>The school said the teachers were used to communicating with Taylor and raised the alarm when they couldn't contact her. </p>

<p>'We are so thankful that our teachers are building relationships with families to know something wasn't right, and for our officers that check in our families,' the district said in a statement. </p>

<p>'Our hearts break with the family, and we are keeping them close in our thoughts and prayers.' </p>

<p>Authorities say Taylor died of natural causes and suspect she suffered a heart attack.  </p>

<p>The boys have been placed in the care of child protective services.  </p>
