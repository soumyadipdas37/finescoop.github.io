<p>The Target tree stands 1.5 metres tall and is made from multiple wooden sticks of varying lengths that turn in different directions to resemble the shape of a tree.</p>

<p>A skeleton-like staff holds the tree in upright on a circular wooden plank and a star is also placed on top. </p>

<p>The $89 Wooden Scandi Christmas tree from Target Australia (pictured) is being ridiculed for its 'ugly' design compared to artificial trees made with realistic leafy branches</p>

<p>The tree caught the attention of shoppers after a woman shared a photo to the Target Mums Australia Facebook group.</p>

<p>'Saw this in store recently. Does anyone have one? Considering purchasing one but wanted to know what anyone else has done with it,' the mum said online.</p>

<p>The post sparked a division between customers as many said the tree looked like a pile of 'sticks' and isn't worth the price. </p>

<p>'What an eyesore,' one woman said, another added: 'Worth $25, no more.'</p>

<p>'80 bucks?? Surely that's not right,' a third said.</p>

<p>'I remember collecting sticks as a kid and making these trees all over our farm,' another commented.</p>

<p>While some weren't impressed with the wooden design, others said they would pay hundreds for a similar style.</p>

<p>'I love this style! I have been quoted $800 for something similar and think $89 is a bargain!' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I would definitely pay $89 for it, I was thinking of getting one when I saw it in store the other day!' another said.</p>

<p>Another woman said she bought a similar tree from Adairs a few years ago, and admitted the style isn't for everyone.</p>

<p>It was decorated with ornaments to add some colour and sparkle to the wooden Christmas tree, which she said is made from recycled branches. </p>

<p>Target also sells a miniature table version of the tree for $25 which can be purchased in stores and online.</p>
