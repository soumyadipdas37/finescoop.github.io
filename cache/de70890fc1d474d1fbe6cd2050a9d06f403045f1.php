<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Charlton's ESI nightmare is finally over, with the Addicks confirming Thomas Sandgaard has acquired 100 per cent of the London club. </p>

<p>Lee Bowyer's side were relegated to League One last season amid chaos in the boardroom but Sandgaard is now looking to turn the tide - claiming he has already pumped in the money to secure Charlton's future. </p>

<p>Signing off an open letter published on the club's website as 'Proud Owner of CAFC' having passed the EFL's Owners and Directors test, the rock music fan was announced with shots of the Danish-born businessman playing the guitar. </p>

<p>Charlton can finally put their ownership struggles behind them after annoucing a new backer</p>

<p>The London club revealed Danish-born businessman and rock fanatic Thomas Sandgaard </p>

<p>Sandgaard's takeover is supported by Charlton fans and he has already pumped in funds </p>

<p>'While there was an injunction in place to prevent the acquisition of ESI, it did not prevent the acquisition of the club itself and so I am thrilled to announce that I have acquired the club from ESI,' Sandgaard said.  </p>

<p>'With the club about to run out of funds this month, it was important that I moved quickly to complete the acquisition and put funds in to the club to ensure its survival. </p>

<p>'The club will also be working quickly post-completion to recover any losses suffered as a result of the actions of the previous owners to the extent possible. </p>

<p>Charlton were relegated to League One under the East Street Investments ownership spell </p>

<p>'I am truly humbled by all the support from Charlton fans, honoured to officially become part of the Charlton family and be part of a team that will lead the club into a successful future. </p>

<p>'The Charlton community is one-of-a-kind. They welcomed and embraced this change of hands with more openness than many others would have given Charlton's history.'</p>

<p>Charlton fans' big day finally arrives less than a year after the nightmare reign of East Street Investments began, and after a consortium led by Paul Elliott launched a botched attempt at acquiring the club, failing the EFL's Owners and Directors test amid a long dispute. </p>

<p>'Today is the day! We did the impossible,' Sandgaard wrote in his open letter. </p>

<p>'We triumphed and we made it to this point because of you.</p>

<p>'Thank you for your passion, your perseverance and your patience. There is no club without you. We are Charlton Athletic Football Club.</p>

<p>'From early on, I felt that we were in this together. I am humbled by your support and honoured to officially become part of the Charlton family. The Charlton community is one of a kind. You welcomed and embraced this change of hands with more openness than many others would have given your history.</p>

<p>'Thank you for standing up for what you believe in. I will not let you down. Cheers to each of you. Cheers to Charlton! I assure you we are just getting started. We are London's club.'  </p>
