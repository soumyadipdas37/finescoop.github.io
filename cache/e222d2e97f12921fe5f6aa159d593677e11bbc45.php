<p>A drunk tradie who led police on a high-speed car chase claims he was forced to drive home because he ate a curry so spicy it made him poo his pants.</p>

<p>Jared Keith Hodgson, from Conder in south Canberra, told the ACT Magistrates Court on Tuesday that he was at a friend's place when he was served a spicy curry.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old panel beater said he does not usually eat chili and 'defecated myself at her house,' The Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>He also claimed he had three beers before dinner and two more as he ate the hot meal.</p>

<p>Court documents showed that Hodgson sped down both lanes of Ashley Drive in Gowrie in his Mitsubishi Lancer before he caught the attention of police.</p>

<p>Officers hit speeds of 130km/h during the chase and believe the tradesman drove faster.</p>

<p>After speeding through a roundabout Hodgson crashed into a gutter and jettisoned over a traffic island, leaving  a trail of skidmarks.</p>

<p>He then stopped for police on Ellerston Ave Isabella Plains.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old panel beater (pictured) told the court he does not usually eat chili and defecated himself at friend's house</p>

<p>Court documents said: 'The defendant’s eyes were bloodshot and glassy, he was unsteady on his feet, slurring his words, smelt strongly of intoxicated liquor and had defecated himself.'</p>

<p>When breathalyzed, Hodgson blew 0.145 - six times the legal limit. </p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to driving unregistered, unlicensed and uninsured, as well as mid-range drunk driving and negligent driving.</p>

<p>Magistrate Margaret Hunter said the decision to drink drive 'had nothing to do' with soiling himself.</p>

<p>She added: 'His behaviour in terms of his driving was clearly a result of his intoxication.' </p>

<p>He was convicted, fined $1,600 and banned from driving for three months.</p>
