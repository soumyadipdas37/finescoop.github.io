<p>Which teammate did you miss during lockdown?</p>

<p>Sam Vokes at Stoke. I played for years with Sam at Wolves, Burnley and Stoke, he’s my go-to guy when I need a chat or a bit of advice. We spoke a lot. I wanted to make sure he wasn’t training as much as me.</p>

<p>What got you through the lockdown weeks?</p>

<p>Home-schooling, looking after the three kids. Two girls and a boy: 14, nine and 16 months, a good range. The little one kept us on our toes.</p>

<p>Earliest footballing memory?</p>

<p>Italia 90, Ireland’s first World Cup and we made it to the quarter-finals. I was only four at the time, I don’t remember a lot about the games but I remember the street parties and everyone going wild and how mad the country was. One of the reasons I fell in love with football.</p>

<p>Ward was a Manchester United fan when he was younger and Ryan Giggs was his hero</p>

<p>Best goal scored? </p>

<p>Chelsea away for Burnley. A short free-kick clipped over the top and I took it on my chest and volleyed it in. We actually won the game and they were the champions, it was a great day all round.</p>

<p>Your 5-a-side team? </p>

<p>Ryan Giggs, my hero as a kid when I was a Man United fan, Paolo Maldini, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. I’ll go in goal.</p>

<p>Staycation or abroad in 2020? </p>

<p>Bit of both. Abroad to Spain and Gibraltar before the quarantine came in and then locally in Nottinghamshire.</p>

<p>Worst job? </p>

<p>Sunday morning paper round. Hated it, six in the morning, it was always hard.</p>

<p>What time go you get up on a day off? </p>

<p>Early, usually 7.15am to take the kids to school.</p>

<p>VAR yes or no? </p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>A wish for the season apart from promotion? </p>

<p>To stay fit and healthy.</p>

<p>If not Ipswich which club? </p>

<p>Burnley. Burnley and Wolves. I’d like to see Burnley have another good season.</p>

<p>One thing you would change from your career? </p>

<p>I’d like to eradicate some of the mistakes in games. Maybe a sending off or giving away a penalty. There’s probably too many to mention. Nothing more.</p>

<p>Something you can’t do? </p>

<p>I’m not very good at DIY.</p>
