<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Billy Brownless may have relished his short time in the jungle while competing on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! </p>

<p>But the AFL legend has admitted he almost didn't sign up for the show.  </p>

<p>Speaking to Sam Newman and Don Scott's You Cannot Be Serious podcast, Billy said he thought the show was for 'B-list celebrities' and 'd***heads', before finding himself in the South African Jungle. </p>

<p>'I used to watch those shows and think look at those d***heads on telly': AFL star Billy Brownless, 53, has revealed he nearly turned down the offer to appear on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! this year </p>

<p>'I used to watch those shows and think look at those d***heads on telly,' Billy, 53, confessed. </p>

<p>'My management rang me and said, 'Bill, they want you to go into the jungle. It might be good for you. You might get off the p**s for a while... lose some weight. And the money is quite good',' he explained.   </p>

<p>Initially turning down the offer, the Geelong Cats great explained: 'I said, 'Bull****, I can't watch those shows, those B grade celebrities walking around and all that!''  </p>

<p>Changing his tune: Speaking to Sam Newman and Don Scott's You Cannot Be Serious podcast this week, Billy admitted he previously thought the show was for 'B-list celebrities' and 'd***heads' </p>

<p>'They called back and said, 'Have a think about it, it might be good for you,' Billy recalled.'</p>

<p>The former athlete said he's glad he went on the show because of the friendships he forged with his co-stars, especially Dale Thomas and Rhonda Burchmore. </p>

<p>I'm A Celebrity also helped the father-of-three shed a whopping 11kg, according to his daughter Ruby. </p>

<p>Thankful: The former athlete said he's glad he went on the show because of the friendships he forged with his co-stars, especially Dale Thomas (right) and Rhonda Burchmore.</p>

<p>In January, the 22-year-old told the Herald Sun that the whole family was 'really proud' of his decision to join the show, adding: 'He lost a lot of weight and it was just a good experience to put everything into perspective.' </p>

<p>Billy wasn't afraid to wear his heart on his sleeve during his stint in the jungle. </p>

<p>It was there he spoke about his ex-wife, Nicky, and how she left him after an affair with his friend Garry Lyon because she 'fell out of love'.</p>

<p>'He lost a lot of weight': I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! also helped the father-of-three shed a whopping 11kg, according to his daughter Ruby. (Pictured: Left in Jan 2019, Right in Jan 2020)</p>

<p>In a conversation with Rhonda Burchmore, he said the pair were estranged, before he spoke candidly about the split which shocked the nation in 2015.</p>

<p>'It was public, very public. Front pages and all that,' he said.</p>

<p>'We had separated which surprised a few. Well she left me, really. She just fell out of love which happens, you know?' </p>

<p>Emotional: During his time in the jungle, Billy candidly spoke about his ex-wife, Nicky, and how she left him after an affair with his friend Garry Lyon because she 'fell out of love'.</p>

<p>Rhonda asked how long they were together for, to which he replied '18 years'.</p>

<p>He continued: 'I didn't expect it. You think she'll come back and all that, but she didn't. So that was a good kick in the guts.'</p>

<p>Lyon and Garry had been friends for 15 years and worked together on the popular AFL Footy Show between 2009 and 2015.  </p>

<p>Tough: In February 2016 news broke that Lyon (second right), who had separated from wife Melissa (right) in 2014, had been having an affair with Nicky (second left with Billy in 2012)</p>
