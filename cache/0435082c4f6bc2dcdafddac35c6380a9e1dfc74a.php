<p>Students recently uploaded a video to TikTok as part of a viral trend showing off the school's facilities</p>

<p>Sydney Church of England Grammar School, also known as the Shore School, sits in Sydney's North Shore</p>

<p>The video also showed the school's gym, which includes treadmills, stationary cycling bikes and weight-lifting facilities. </p>

<p>The $33,000-a-year school sits on a eight-hectare block and features classrooms, lecture theatres and a 500-seat auditorium, according to the school's website.</p>

<p>There are cricket nets, as well as tennis and basketball courts, two squash courts and a 25-metre swimming pool and diving facilities. </p>

<p>There are also boarding facilities and a chapel on campus as well. </p>

<p>There are other incredible facilities at the $33,000-per-year school that weren't included in the video</p>

<p>The Shore School's student's video went viral, with other school children from across the country making similar clips to compare facilities. </p>

<p>However, administration were not impressed with the video posted on TikTok.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the school told the Daily Telegraph the students involved were told to remove the clip as it breached the school's social media policy.</p>

<p>Students are allowed to use mobile phones on campus, and footage shot inside of the school is also banned from appearing online.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the school told the Daily Telegraph the students involved were told to remove the clip as it breached the school's social media policy</p>

<p>Those involved were told not to do it again. </p>

<p>David Shoebridge, NSW Greens MLC, called the footage 'deeply offensive'. </p>

<p>'Students can see how unfair and unbalanced school funding is,' Mr Shoebridge said.</p>

<p>'It's just extraordinary how most politicians can't.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Shore School for comment. </p>
