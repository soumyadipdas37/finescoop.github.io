<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United reportedly want to bring in up to three more signings before the transfer window shuts.</p>

<p>The Red Devils have long been chasing Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho who remains their priority signing.</p>

<p>Manchester Evening News (MEN) have reported that the club want three more signings before October 5, but are open to potentially signing a left-back, a centre-back and a centre-forward.</p>

<p>England star Jadon Sancho is still a key target for Manchester United to secure this summer </p>

<p>Bournemouth youngster David Brooks is seen as a possible alternative signing to Sancho</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are still keen on signing Sancho despite missing a deadline to secure the English winger, who the Germans value at £108m. </p>

<p>It has previously been reported that discussions between the two parties are ongoing, albeit slowly, and United will not negotiate a fee with until a deal has been reached with the 20-year-old's representatives.</p>

<p>They are said to be looking at a number of alternatives though if they can't get their man. </p>

<p>The MEN state that David Brooks of Bournemouth has been 'under consideration by United' for more than a year, but deemed him too expensive last season with the Championship side then valuing him at £50m.</p>

<p>United could also pursue Douglas Costa from Juventus on a one-year loan deal as a stop-gap until next summer.</p>

<p>A left back is not a priority signing for them but the MEN say that United have been impressed by Vitaliy Mykolenko of Dynamo Kiev.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old is regular for the Ukrainian side and also broken into the national team.</p>

<p>United are also monitoring Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguillon who impressed on-loan at Sevilla against the Red Devils in the Europa League last season.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek remains Manchester United's only signing so far this transfer window</p>

<p>Up front Manchester United will have to look for a striker, especially with Odion Ighalo set to return to China in January.</p>

<p>And at centre-back United will look to get rid of Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Marcus Rojo and try and get a replacement.</p>

<p>United have been linked with Dayot Upamecano, though the 21-year-old Frenchman just signed a new deal this summer. </p>

<p>Manchester United have made just the one signing so far this summer, with Donny van de Beek arriving from Ajax for £40m.   </p>

<p>Solskjaer will hope for a few more signings to help his side close the gap to Liverpool and Manchester City at the top of the table. </p>
