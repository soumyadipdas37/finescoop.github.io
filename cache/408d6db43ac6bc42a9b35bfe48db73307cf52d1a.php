<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police investigating the disappearance of Colorado mom Suzanne Morphew demanded security footage from businesses in the area close to the hotel used by her husband on the day she vanished, DailyMail.com can disclose.</p>

<p>Investigators asked every business near the Holiday Inn Express in Broomfield, Colorado, to turn over video shot between Thursday May 7 and Sunday May 10 – the day Suzanne was reported missing by neighbor Jeanne Ritter, 70.</p>

<p>Suzanne’s husband Barry, 52, was checked into the hotel on the day she vanished and had traveled there for a landscaping job nearby.</p>

<p>DailyMail.com previously revealed that he left his room stinking of chlorine and littered with wet towels and discarded mail.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, colleague Jeff Puckett, 47, told how he had been taken aback by the strong chemical smell when he took the room over after being ordered to the area for work by Barry.</p>

<p>The hotel has confirmed that they do not use chlorine to clean guest rooms and that the hotel pool was closed at the time of Morphew’s visit.</p>

<p>Police investigating the disappearance of Colorado mom Suzanne Morphew demanded security footage from businesses in the area close to the hotel used by her husband Barry on the day she vanished, DailyMail.com can disclose. The Colorado mother-of-two disappeared on Mother's Day, May 10</p>

<p>Barry, 52, was checked into the Holiday Inn Express in Broomfield, Colorado, on the day she vanished and had traveled there for a landscaping job nearby. DailyMail.com previously revealed that he left his room stinking of chlorine and littered with wet towels and discarded mail. Investigators asked every business near the hotel to turn over video </p>

<p>Puckett also told how he and co-worker Morgan Gentile had been left without tools to complete the job they had been told was urgent – despite Barry claiming in an interview with a local news channel that it had been planned long before.</p>

<p>In an interview last week, Gentile, who has now relocated to South Dakota, confirmed the room stank of chlorine and added: 'I'm scared of Barry. I don't want to see him again, ever again.'</p>

<p>The new revelations come from a worker at one of the Broomfield businesses who told of the police sweep in a Facebook post last month.</p>

<p>It was made shortly after DailyMail.com’s exclusive interview with Puckett and read: ‘Now I know why the CBI agent was at a business I happen to work at, asking for all our camera footage from Thursday before Mother’s Day all the way through to Mother’s Day.’</p>

<p>The worker, whose identity is known to DailyMail.com, added: ‘They got all of the camera footage from all of the businesses off that stretch off of the 36 [freeway] in Broomfield. Now it all makes sense.’</p>

<p>Police have also taken security footage from the Holiday Inn Express itself, according to a manager at the property who spoke to DailyMail.com in August.</p>

<p>Suzanne, a 49-year-old mother-of-two, has now been missing for more than four months, despite intensive police searches and hundreds of tips.</p>

<p>Last month, Barry (pictured grilling out in July) claimed to have given 30 hours of interviews to police and accused them of botching the initial investigation. A day later, Suzanne’s brother Andy Moorman, 58, accused him of refusing to take a polygraph test and said he doesn’t feel that Barry is ‘fully cooperating’ with the investigation </p>

<p>Her disappearance was reported after her daughters Mallory and Macy were unable to get hold of her on Mother’s Day.</p>

<p>The initial search spanned the area around her $1.5m home in Maysville, close to Salida, Colorado, and her abandoned bike was found on a nearby bridge on the same day.</p>

<p>Two days later, a personal item – thought to be her bike helmet – was found, while police divers were photographed searching a local dam by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Barry offered a $100,000 reward for her safe return and filmed an emotional video pleading for her to come home.</p>

<p>But less than three days after Suzanne vanished, attention turned to the family property – with CBI investigators seen carrying evidence bags into the house in photos taken by DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>A work site close to the Arkansas River in Salida was also searched, with investigators saying Barry had been working there in the week preceding Suzanne’s disappearance.</p>

<p>Gentile said she was with him at the work site on May 9 but was dismissed early and left at 11am despite having been expecting to be there all day.</p>

<p>Speaking to Fox 21, she said: ‘He was acting really weird about the beach area. I was like: "Barry what's up?" He seemed stressed. He definitely seemed weird on Saturday.</p>

<p>'He said that he had to go make the wife happy – do some hiking or biking. And I found out, like, later that day that he was in town all day.'</p>

<p>Last month, Barry claimed to have given 30 hours of interviews to police and accused them of botching the initial investigation.</p>

<p>A day later, Suzanne’s brother Andy Moorman, 58, accused him of refusing to take a polygraph test and said he doesn’t feel that Barry is ‘fully cooperating’ with the investigation</p>

<p>Moorman also revealed he had been told that the family home smelled strongly of chemicals when investigators searched it.</p>

<p>Barry has since spoken to Fox 21 and strongly denied any wrongdoing, while also claiming Puckett and Gentile are drug addicts and saying ‘the FBI lie’ when asked about the chemical smell in his home.</p>

<p>He added: 'I am innocent. 100 percent innocent. The social media and the news media has made it seem like I'm a bad guy.'</p>

<p>The police investigation into Suzanne’s disappearance remains open, while Moorman is fundraising for a fresh search of the area around her home later this month.</p>

<p>He has said he plans to take a team of volunteers to conduct an inch-by-inch search of the area in which she vanished</p>
