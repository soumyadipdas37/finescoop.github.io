<p>A team of carpenters used an 800-year-old technique to painstakingly rebuild Notre Dame Cathedral by raising a three-ton oak truss in front of the landmark on September 19 </p>

<p>Medieval techniques were used by the carpenters to build the triangular frames in the central part of the church according to AP. </p>

<p>It comes after a decision to replicate the cathedral in it's original form. </p>

<p>General Jean-Louis Georgelin, head of the reconstruction, said it was the 'right choice' to build the carpentry identically. </p>

<p>The spire was also toppled in the blaze, and there were debates on whether the new spire should be futuristic or made of fireproof cement. </p>

<p>A decision was made in July to respect the original design and material of the cathedral.  </p>

<p>A total of 25 trusses are to be installed in the cathedral nave, with President Emmanuel Macron wanting it reopened in time for the Paris Olympic Games in 2024.</p>

<p>The wooden structures are a replica of those consumed in the devastating fire in April 2019 and decisions were made to replicate the cathedral in it's original form</p>

<p>With rope cables and a rustic pulley system, the carpenters slowly pulled the truss they built in July from the ground where it was laid out.   </p>

<p>Once the truss replica was raised on high, a carpenter shinnied up the wooden beams to tie an oak branch to the top of the triangular structure.</p>

<p>This is a symbol of prosperity and a salute to the workers, a tradition still honoured in numerous European countries. </p>
