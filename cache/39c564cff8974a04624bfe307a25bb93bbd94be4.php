<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians have sparked a heated debate on social media over what they typically call the end of a loaf of bread - and the answers are very different.</p>

<p>Mother-of-three Kate Freebairn, the founder of The Pantry Mama, asked her followers what term they used to describe the first and last slices of the bread.</p>

<p>'What do you call the end piece of bread? And do you eat it?' she wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>The post provoked much discussion among Australians, with a majority of people labelling the end pieces as the 'crust'.</p>

<p>However, many had their own suggestions for its name, including 'heel', 'end piece', 'doorstep', 'butt', 'topper', 'bunty', 'knobby', 'bird food', 'cuppy' and 'my husband's'.</p>

<p>'My hubby and I argue about this. I call it "the crust" or the "end of the bread" and hubby grew up in a Dutch family and he calls it "the cuppy",' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second woman agreed, saying she also describes them as crusts in her household.</p>

<p>'Not fussed about commercial loaves but we keep the crusts on good bread to keep the ends fresh. Once we reach the end of the loaf my husband and I have an unwritten pact to share the crusts,' she said.</p>

<p>A third woman said: 'We call it the crust. We only eat it if we're low on bread.'</p>

<p>Another popular answer for the end slices was the 'heel', which is a common term used in the UK and the US.</p>

<p>'The heel. And yes [I do eat it], but only if I put butter on it and throw it under the broiler until it gets a little brown,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second woman said: 'The heel or the best first slice.'</p>

<p>Others suggested unique terms to describe the end pieces of the bread, such as the 'topper', 'butt', 'knobby', 'the nub', 'petiche', 'bunty' or 'knob'.</p>

<p>'We call it the bum bit - the fight to eat it first is real between my partner and my daughter,' one woman said.</p>

<p>Many said eating the end pieces depended on the 'type of bread' while others suggested it'll only be consumed if it's a fresh loaf from the bakery or home baked (stock image)</p>

<p>When do you eat the end pieces of the bread?</p>

<p>A second woman said: 'Depends on the bread type... if it's a loaf then crust but a French stick, it's the elbow... If you eat it, your mother-in-law will like you more (I grew up with that saying).'</p>

<p>A third suggested: 'The Nickelback because nobody likes it but me.'</p>

<p>Another woman said her family calls it 'Kontje', which is Dutch for 'bum'.</p>

<p>'My kids eat them. Actually they fight over them,' she added.</p>

<p>Many said eating the end pieces depended on the 'type of bread' while others suggested it'll only be consumed if it's a fresh loaf from the bakery or home baked.</p>

<p>'In my opinion, it's one of the most coveted slabs of home baked hot bread -but only when straight out of the oven and smothered with butter,' one woman said.</p>

<p>This follows a similar debate that erupted on Twitter at the end of 2018 when Nigella Lawson weighed in on topic, calling it an 'elbow on a baguette'.</p>
