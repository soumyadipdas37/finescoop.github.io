<p>Labour-run Hammersmith and Fulham council told staff 'any part of a private dwelling used solely for work purposes will be required to be smoke-free'. </p>

<p>The smoking ban has been criticised by campaigners as as a 'moral crusade' that is 'waging war on choice and personal freedom'.  </p>

<p>When approached for comment, The London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham declined to comment. </p>

<p>However, a council source told The Telegraph that the smoking ban for home workers, while currently in force, was being replaced and that no staff member had been disciplined for a breach of policy. </p>

<p>It comes as a new report called 'Smokefree Ideology - How local authorities are waging war on choice and personal freedom', revealed the strict policies councils have in place for staff.</p>

<p>From a survey of 147 of councils, with an explicit policy on cigarette breaks, the report revealed that just 10 councils allowed workers to take smoke breaks.</p>

<p>The figures show that 50 councils have banned smoking or vaping breaks entirely - even if staff were clocked out or walking between work appointments. </p>

<p>The report is funded by pro-smoking lobby group, Forest, and will be published tomorrow by freedom campaigners, the Manifesto Club. </p>

<p>Author of the report, Josie Appleton, said the restrictions on smoking weren't about smoking risks but rather 'a moral crusade' against smoking as a 'shameful' activity. </p>

<p>She added that councils should focus on providing public services, rather than 'interfering in the lifestyle choices of their employees'.</p>

<p>However, the Chairman of the Local Government Association's Community Well-being Board, Councillor Ian Hudspeth, defended the councils' smoking policies telling the Telegraph that they were being 'responsible employers'. </p>
