<p>And it seems things are going from strength to strength for Zac Efron, 32, and rumoured new girlfriend, Vanessa Valladares.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the pair were spotted enjoying brunch at a beachside cafe in Lennox Head, which is close to Byron Bay. </p>

<p>Something to tell us? On Saturday, Zac Efron and rumoured new girlfriend Vanessa Valladares stepped out for brunch in Lennox Head after their ski holiday</p>

<p>Flashing the pins: Vanessa meanwhile, showed off her trim pins in a leather-look miniskirt and a white printed T-shirt</p>

<p>She teamed the look with maroon sandals, a gold necklace and dark sunglasses.</p>

<p>The pair looked relaxed on the outing, sitting by an open window as they waited for their meals. </p>

<p>At one point, Zac kept occupied on his phone. </p>

<p>The pair have just got back from a ski holiday in Thredbo.  </p>

<p>In photos obtained by The Herald Sun, the pair were spotted leaving a plane in Ballina together following the trip.</p>

<p>The Hollywood actor, 32, reportedly met Vanessa in July when she was working as a waitress.</p>

<p>She's rumoured to have quit her job now and is said to be staying with Zac at Belongil Beach. </p>

<p>Last month, Daily Mail Australia revealed that Zac had cancelled a scheduled flight back to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>'He was only planning to fly home if he had to,' a source revealed. 'He didn't really want to go back to America.'  </p>

<p>Zac had purchased the plane ticket several months ago in case his application for a visa extension was denied by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

<p>But it seems his request to have his tourist visa extended from three months to 12 months was granted, hence why he cancelled his trip home.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia understands Zac received a last-minute refund for his ticket.</p>

<p>It comes just days after The Daily Telegraph reported that Zac had 'inspected and put in an offer' on a home in Byron Bay. </p>

<p>However, he was apparently outbid at the last minute by a rival buyer.</p>

<p>Zac was apparently disappointed because he had 'fallen in love' with Byron Bay.</p>

<p>While he is staying in Australia for the time being, the Baywatch star will have to return to America eventually due to his filming commitments.</p>

<p>He is scheduled to star in the Disney+ remake of Three Men and a Baby, based on the classic 1987 comedy starring Steve Guttenberg, Tom Selleck and Ted Danson.</p>
