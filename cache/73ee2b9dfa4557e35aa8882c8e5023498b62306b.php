<p>Lauren also discussed her absence from the recent TOWIE 10th anniversary show. </p>

<p>She said: 'I wasn't available that day and it was more about people currently on the show. I have a lot of love for it but I've been there and done that. I put out a social media shout-out and will always support it...</p>

<p>'It's where I started. It was strange and weird as there weren't any other reality shows. I left the show 7/8 years ago and I'm still very current. I've experienced such great things that I wouldn't have had without it.' </p>

<p>At Christmas, I had everyone at my house and I felt like I was having a heart attack the day after. I collapsed, couldn't breathe, my heart was racing and I called an ambulance. They did checks, took me to anxiety and told me I had an anxiety attack...</p>

<p>'It feels awful. I first had a panic attack on aeroplane, it's been about for about eight years. I just need to recognise what it is and that I'm not going to die.'</p>
