<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Viewers of The Singapore Grip slammed the new ITV drama last night as they deemed the acting 'dire' and said the script left the series 'dead in the water'.     </p>

<p>The second episode of the programme, which aired last night, saw audiences at home panning the acting in the WWII drama, with some saying the 'awful' script had left the actors with 'nothing to work with.'</p>

<p>Based on the 1978 novel by JG Farrell, which drew on real events, The Singapore Grip is initially the story of rich Brits living lives of excess in the Crown colony in the early 1940s.</p>

<p>But the invasion of the island by Japan in 1942, one of the key events of the Second World War, throws their lives into turmoil. </p>

<p>Yet many of those watching at home were hugely critical of the programme last night, with one commenting: 'This series is dead in the water. It’s not awful, just irredeemably mediocre. </p>

<p>Viewers of The Singapore Grip slammed the new ITV drama last night as they deemed the acting 'dire' and said the script left the series 'dead in the water'</p>

<p>'The script gives the actors nothing to work with. What a pity, as the book is excellent.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'I'm able to analyse post colonial critique, but this fails on every level. It's not satire, it's insulting to everyone from everywhere, and the acting is just woeful.'</p>

<p>One added: 'Just started watching episode 2.. the acting is dire, the plot lines are flimsy, and if the Japanese burst in a beheaded them all..... no one would notice..</p>

<p>'Stayed to the end... Will never get the time back. Awful dross.'</p>

<p>Many of those watching at home questioned the acting in the ITV drama, which is adapted from JG Farrell’s 1978 satirical novel mocking British colonial attitudes</p>

<p>They questioned: 'How much was spent on this drivel?'</p>

<p>'Is this supposed to be a comedy because the acting and script are very OTT?!' a fourth wrote. 'Not sure what to make of it. #singaporegrip' </p>

<p>Viewers slammed the acting in the drama as they questioned whether it was satirical or not, with one calling the series 'dead in the water'</p>

<p>In the second episode of the drama, much of the focus is on the team running military operations. </p>

<p>They dismissed the threat of the Japanese before being left cowering under the table when the threat materialised. </p>

<p>Meanwhile rubber merchant Walter Blackett, David Morrissey, struggled to deal with his son Monty, played by Luke Newberry, who treated  the servants with contempt and scoffed at the suggestion of expolitation of Indian labourers. </p>

<p>In another scene, Matthew, played by Luke Treadaway, fell head over heels for the Chinese woman Vera Chiang, played by Elizabeth Tan. </p>

<p>It follows in the footsteps of Downton Abbey and The Durrells as ITV's new six-part period drama - but The Singapore Grip  has so far failed to win over viewers. Pictured, the Blackett family and guests appearing shocked by their evening entertainment</p>

<p>The criticism comes after the first episode was panned by viewers, which left audiences at home 'switching off' and complaining about the 'bizarre' storyline - after shifting timelines from before and during the Second World War's Battle of Singapore.</p>

<p>After the premiere, one viewer commented: 'I've already given up on The Singapore Grip. Couldn't get into it, despite a strong cast. Need another Downton Abbey or The Durrells for the perfect Sunday night viewing to get me watching.'</p>

<p>'I can't be alone in not having a clue about what's happening? It's bizarre,' a third unimpressed Twitter user wrote.</p>
