<p>Marvin recently admitted he loves the fact that Rochelle earns more money than him during an appearance on Loose Women.</p>

<p>Taking part in a Soccer Aid for Unicef special on the show, dubbed Loose Women &amp; Men, Marvin said: 'I'm buzzing that Roch earns more money than me. We're lucky with what we do, we've had a busy few weeks.</p>

<p>'Growing up, both my mum and dad did the same amount of hours, so I've grown up with my mum and dad earning equally. </p>

<p>'It's nice for the girls seeing their mum doing so well and working so hard for what she wants, it's no problem at all.' </p>

<p>Rochelle recently told how she became emotional after eldest daughter Alaia started at a new school following the extended break during lockdown.</p>

<p>The TV presenter and singer, broke down in tears as she told her followers how she was feeling on Instagram. </p>

<p>She said: 'A lot of change for us at the minute as a family - new house, new area but, the most change for my Alaia starting a brand new school after lockdown. </p>

<p>'I’m so proud of how brave she is and so ready for a new adventure, so odd for me to not being able to go in and make sure she’s okay but I guess that’s the new "normal" for you.</p>

<p>'I held it together and as soon as the door shut I lost it. Being a parent is never easy...please tell me it’s not just me? She’s totally fine by the way and SO excited. I think I got more upset because Marv is away too'.</p>
