<p>Fearne said that with her family holed up at home in lockdown she's also argued with her son Rex, seven, and daughter Honey, four, but insisted their family is stronger than ever. </p>

<p>Jesse also has Arthur and daughter Lola, 15, from his previous marriage to Tilly Wood.  </p>

<p>Speaking on her Happy Place podcast according to The Sun, Fearne admitted she and Jesse had several rows in front of their children during lockdown. </p>

<p>She said: 'I've also shouted at my kids like I think most parents have, especially during lockdown.</p>

<p>'We have no school, full-time work for me, no help here ­whatsoever — like most families, you're just stuck within four walls trying to survive.' </p>

<p>Fearne added: 'It has been mad. We've all had a shout at each other, the kids have shouted at me, we've shouted at them. But I constantly endeavour to go, ''Fearne, don't act like a child, get yourself together''.'</p>

<p>In previous years Fearne has been incredibly open about some of the more difficult patches in her six-year marriage to Jesse, and last year admitted that they were left 'clinging' onto their relationship after a 'two hour screaming match.'   </p>
