<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Proud new dad Rory McIlroy said it had already been the best week of his life. ‘Now let’s see if we can sprinkle a little icing on the cake,’ he added.</p>

<p>The Northern Irishman’s wife Erica gave birth to their daughter Poppy Kennedy on Monday, and McIlroy admitted it had been a wrench leaving them for a flight to Atlanta on Thursday for his defence of the FedEx Cup, beginning today, and its mammoth $15million (£11.3m) bonus.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is just as well that McIlroy has his own plane these days, as he confessed: ‘I was supposed to fly at 8am but in the end I didn’t leave the house until then. It was really hard to leave but at the end of the day, life doesn’t stop. </p>

<p>Rory McIlroy (above) became a new father just before flying to Atlanta for the FedEx Cup</p>

<p>McIlroy shared news of his new daughter, Poppy Kennedy, who was born on Monday</p>

<p>‘I know Erica is surrounded by her family and my mum and dad are just around the corner, so she’s got all the help she needs.’</p>

<p>The life-changing event has left McIlroy in reflective mood. ‘If I can’t be content now, I don’t think I’ll ever be,’ he said. </p>

<p>‘Everything that has happened to me on and off the golf course has already been beyond my wildest dreams. I’m just so grateful, I have to pinch myself and ask: why me, why am I so lucky?’</p>

<p>The Irishman now returns to the golf course without a top-ten finish in his last eight events</p>

<p>He will certainly need some Irish luck if he is to complete his first week as a father with another victory at East Lake, one of his favourite venues on tour. </p>

<p>A handicap system is employed at the FedEx finale, the Tour Championship, to reflect the first two play-off events. Dustin Johnson, having won one and finished second in the other, will start at 10-under par with a two-shot advantage over Spaniard Jon Rahm, who beat the American in a play-off on Sunday.</p>

<p>Without a top-10 finish in his last eight events, McIlroy will start seven in arrears, a daunting margin given but by no means insurmountable. In 2017, Justin Rose made up a six-shot deficit on Johnson in one round to win the HSBC Champions in China. Last year, McIlroy began five shots behind Justin Thomas but still won.</p>

<p>‘I know my form after lockdown hasn’t been good but, with everything ok at home, maybe things will now just fall into place,’ said Rory.</p>

<p>England’s Andy Sullivan bemoaned the brutal conditions at Valderrama as only five players broke par on the opening day of the Andalucia Masters. </p>

<p>Sullivan, four shots off the lead after a two-over 73, said: ‘It’s tough to hit fairways and greens here in the flat calm so when there’s a 20mph gusting wind it is just havoc out here.’</p>
