<p>The NSW Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) on Thursday awarded a 0.3 per cent pay increase to public servants, instead to their usual 2.5 per cent. </p>

<p>Premier Gladys Berejiklian had attempted to freeze pay rises back in May due to COVID-19 to help save the state $3billion. </p>

<p>The IRC's decision was declared a 'kick in the guts' for frontline workers such as nurses, firefighters and police officers who helped with COVID-19 and bushfires.</p>

<p>'The commission proposes to make awards and variations to avoid such a reduction, by awarding increases of 0.3 per cent,' the IRC said in its published decision.</p>

<p>'We recognise that it will do little to alleviate the concerns of those witnesses and any like-minded co-workers who see the employers' position in these proceedings as failing to recognise, let alone reward, their efforts.'</p>

<p>Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey said the IRC's decision was 'unacceptable' and unions would be seeking legal action.  </p>

<p>'Today is a kick in the guts for every public sector worker that got us through not only bushfires but COVID,' he said.  </p>

<p>Public Service Association general secretary Stewart Little said the outcome affects workers who have stopped the pandemic from overwhelming hospitals, schools, prisons and the community.</p>

<p>'We see this decision as absolutely diabolical,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>Firefighters were not happy with the decision after they had been seeking their annual 2.5 per cent annual pay rise (Pictured: RFS crews battling fires in Kangaroo Valley on January 5)</p>

<p>NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association general secretary Brett Holmes said it's a 'disgraceful' outcome for nurses who have been putting their lives and their families at risk amid COVID-19.</p>

<p>NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos described the ruling as 'nothing short of an insult'.</p>

<p>NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay said she was 'bitterly disappointed' by the decision.</p>

<p>'I am thinking of 400,000 public sector employees who have been ripped off,' she told reporters.</p>
