<p>Over on the Today show, Paris elaborated on her achievements in business.</p>

<p>The former socialite also explained that her YouTube documentary, This Is Paris, was initially intended to be about her life now as a businesswoman.</p>

<p>However, she revealed that she became close friends with the documentary's director Alexandra Dean and began speaking about the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah.</p>

<p>'There are families that have approached me who have pulled their children out of that school that I was at because they saw the trailer to my film,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's exciting that this is making a difference and going to help save children's lives.' </p>

<p>Revealing: This Is Paris was initially intended to be about her life now as a businesswoman. However, she speaks about the physical and mental abuse she faced as a teenager at a boarding school in Utah</p>

<p>Paris' wealthy parents, Kathy and Richard, sent her to many boarding schools following a rebellious phase after living at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City.</p>

<p>Paris spent 11 months at Provo Canyon School, the last in a series of institutions which focuses on behavioural and mental development.</p>

<p>Between 2011 and 2014, police responded to 56 calls for assault at Provo and 25 for sexual offences.</p>

<p>In a statement to People, the boarding school said: 'Originally opened in 1971, Provo Canyon School was sold by its previous ownership in August 2000. </p>

<p>Abuse: Elsewhere in the documentary, the heiress opened up about enduring 'multiple abusive relationships' in her life. Paris says she was abused by five of her exes, who were all sweet and kind to her in the beginning of their relationship before making a dramatic change</p>

<p>'We therefore cannot comment on the operations or patient experience prior to this time.' MailOnline has contacted Provo Canyon School for further comment.</p>
