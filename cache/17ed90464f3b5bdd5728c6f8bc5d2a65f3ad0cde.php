<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A YouTuber who rakes in £100,000 a year through his online channel has been unveiled as Blue Peter's new presenter.</p>

<p>Adam Beales - who has nearly three million viewers already on his Adam B feed - has been brought in by the BBC in a bid to freshen up the children's TV show.</p>

<p>Beales, 20, who bought his parents their £165,000 house, will be officially unveiled on Thursday alongside the current line-up of Lindsey Russell, Richie Driss, Mwaka Mudenda and Henry the dog.</p>

<p>He recently revealed fans' parents had been 'creeping him out' after publishing his address online and planning to visit him.</p>

<p>And Companies House public documents already show his star power, with his most recent accounts showing his YouTube firm's current assets rose £113,080 in just one year. </p>

<p>Londonderry-born Beales follows in the footsteps of fellow Northern Irish presenters the late Caron Keating and, more recently, Zoe Salmon.</p>

<p>He said: "I'm super excited to become Blue Peter Presenter number 40. I am humbled and ecstatic to be part of such a legendary production.</p>

<p>Adam Beales, 20, is the new Blue Peter presenter and has a history in broadcast from YouTube</p>

<p>"It's kind of weird - in a super exciting way - that the show I once watched when I was younger, is now the show I will be presenting along with the talented Lindsey, Richie, Mwaksy and of course, Henry.</p>

<p>"I can't wait to get stuck in, even with the challenges they throw at me, though I am hoping none of them involve cheese - I hate cheese!"</p>

<p>Beales is a regular face on CBBC's The Dog Ate My Homework, hosted by Love Island narrator Iain Stirling.</p>

<p>He was head boy at school and was considering Oxford or Cambridge universities before his YouTube channel took off, which now has nearly three million subscribers.</p>

<p>Beales had publicly posted he was worried about people finding out where he lived</p>

<p>His mother, father and younger brother, 11-year-old Callum, often feature in his videos, which include pranks, challenges, DIY crafts and life hacks.</p>

<p>One of his more memorable ones just last week appeared to be a hint at his new job, when he dyed his pet dog blue. </p>

<p>And in June this year he expressed concern about people turning up to his house unannounced.</p>

<p>He wrote on his Twitter page: 'I’ve seen a Facebook thread going around with parents discussing where I live, what number house I live in, planning to go visit the house, when and where they’ve seen me outside the house.</p>

<p>'If you come across anything like this online, please report it. It creeps me out.'</p>

<p>Mwaksy Mudenda was the most recent new presenter and had been unveiled in May this year</p>

<p>Konnie Huq, Gethin Jones, Andy Akinwolere and Zoe Salmon were presented during its heyday</p>

<p>Beales' first Blue Peter challenge will see him winched down a cliff face to complete a training exercise with the Buxton Mountain Rescue Team.</p>

<p>Show editor, Ellen Evans, said: "Adam really impressed us during his auditions, he's a natural in front of the camera but he's also very funny, incredibly warm, brilliant with kids and also perhaps a little bit mischievous which the Blue Peter audience will absolutely love."</p>

<p>Head of BBC Children's in house productions, Helen Bullough, said: "Throughout lockdown Blue Peter fans have been telling us how much they've enjoyed and appreciated the show's unstinting commitment to engaging, inspiring and entertaining them and we can't wait for presenter Number 40 to join us and get stuck in!</p>

<p>"Adam is playful, thoughtful and already popular with our audience, who I'm sure will give him the biggest ever Blue Peter welcome."</p>

<p>Beales will make his Blue Peter debut on CBBC and BBC iPlayer at 5.30pm on Thursday.</p>
