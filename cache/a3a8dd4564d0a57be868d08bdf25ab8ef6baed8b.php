<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gabriel Jesus is the latest Manchester City star struck down by injury, leaving teenager Liam Delap their only recognised striker.</p>

<p>Brazil announced on Friday that Jesus had been withdrawn from next month's World Cup qualifiers after suffering a problem during Monday's win at Wolves.</p>

<p>Guardiola's injury problems have deepened, with the manager claiming he has just 13 senior professionals available for Sunday's home clash with Leicester City.</p>

<p>It has been revealed that Gabriel Jesus suffered an injury in Manchester City's win at Wolves</p>

<p>Delap, 17, is in contention to make a Premier League debut after scoring on his professional bow during Thursday night's 2-1 Carabao Cup third round victory over Bournemouth. Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne have been used as false nines in previous campaigns.</p>

<p>City have been without Sergio Aguero, Bernardo Silva, Joao Cancelo, Aleks Zinchenko and Nicolas Otamendi, while Ilkay Gundogan remains in self-isolation after testing positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>Aymeric Laporte is back training but may not be risked tomorrow. John Stones and Fernandinho were also absent on Thursday night and it is unclear who Guardiola can call upon.</p>

<p>It leaves Pep Guardiola with a conundrum as injury crisis worsens ahead of Leicester match</p>

<p>'We have just 13 players available,' Guardiola said. 'But at this club, excuses don't exist. We have to win the games. We need the academy, not just for the training sessions.</p>

<p>'With the problems we have up front, of course Liam will stay with us. We'll see if we need him or use him.' Young academy products Taylor Harwood-Bellis, Cole Palmer, Tommy Doyle and Felix Nmecha also have a chance of being named in the squad.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sportsmail understands City are on the verge of signing young Rangers striker Adedire Mebude - partly as a consequence of Delap's rapid rise to prominence.</p>

<p>17-year-old Liam Delap (left) is currently City's only fit and available striker</p>

<p>Delap trained with Guardiola's squad during Project Restart and the club had planned to play the striker up at Under-23 level this season, leaving a slot in their Under 18 team.</p>

<p>That, coupled with Charlie McNeill's departure for rivals Manchester United, has seen City move for 16-year-old Mebude, who is expected to sign for a fee in the region of £200,000.</p>
