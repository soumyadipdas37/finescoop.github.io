<p>Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is making plans to improve several areas of his squad this week, with Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek set to join Ajax in a £40million transfer. </p>

<p>And the Red Devils boss is looking to improve his centre-back options to find the perfect partner for United captain Harry Maguire.</p>

<p>And according to ESPN, Solskjaer is confident in securing a deal for Upamecano before the transfer deadline on October 5. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old Frenchman recently signed a new contract at the Bundesliga club, who reached the Champions League semi-finals before being knocked out by Paris Saint-Germain. </p>

<p>Upamecano used to have a £53million release clause in his previous contract, but the new deal has reportedly seen that figure drop to £37m - though it can only be activated after the 2020-21 season. </p>

<p>The French defender has played 112 times for Leipzig since arriving from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2017. </p>

<p>Out of those displays, 37 came last season and Upamecano impressed as Julian Nagelsmann's side reached the last four of the competition. </p>

<p>In terms of centre-back options, Manchester United currently have Eric Bailly and Victor Lindelof fighting for first-team spots alongside Maguire, while Marcos Rojo and Chris Smalling were loaned out during the 2019-20 season.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Phil Jones only played eight times in all competitions under Solskjaer last year and the 28-year-old has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford.</p>

<p>The arrival of Upamecano would be a blow for Victor Lindelof (left) and Eric Bailly (right)</p>

<p>Manchester United are also looking to improve their attack line, with Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho high up on their transfer target list.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old England international was the subject of an approach by the Premier League club earlier this summer, but United missed Dortmund's August 10 deadline to finalise an agreement.</p>

<p>Despite this setback, the Red Devils reportedly believe they can still manufacture a deal for Sancho by the end of the transfer window in October. </p>
