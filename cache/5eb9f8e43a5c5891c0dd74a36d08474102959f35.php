<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday night to claim that 'a plane full of thugs' boarded a flight intent on causing chaos at the Republican National Convention.</p>

<p>The president spoke to Laura Ingraham for an interview on Monday which, at times, even made her raise her eyebrows.</p>

<p>Trump said that someone was on a flight to Washington DC, ahead of his Thursday speech, and saw the crowd of 'thugs'.</p>

<p>'This person was coming to the Republican National Convention and there were like seven people in the plane [with] this person, and then a lot of people were on the plane to do big damage,' Trump insisted. </p>

<p>'This is all happening.' </p>

<p>Donald Trump appeared on Fox News on Monday evening and spoke of a 'plane of thugs'</p>

<p>The president told Laura Ingraham that he could not publicly disclose details of the flights</p>

<p>Trump said that his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, was having his 'strings' pulled by 'people in the dark shadows, people you have never heard of.'</p>

<p>Ingraham replied: 'What does that mean? That sounds like conspiracy theory.'</p>

<p>He replies: 'We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city, this weekend.</p>

<p>'And in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.</p>

<p>'They're on a plane.'</p>

<p>When asked for details, he replied: 'I'll tell you some time. It's under investigation right now.'   </p>

<p>The president said 'very stupid rich people' were fomenting violence. </p>

<p>'The money is coming from some very stupid rich people [who] have no idea that if their thing ever succeeded, which it won't, they will be thrown to the wolves like you've never seen before,' he said. </p>

<p>His reference to 'this weekend' was perplexing, given the RNC finished on Thursday. </p>

<p>This weekend saw lethal violence in Portland, Oregon, as a member of a self-professed militia was shot and killed on Saturday night by a man who calls himself an anti-fascist.</p>

<p>The confrontations were sparked by a pro-Trump caravan of vehicles which set off in a procession through the city - the scene of protest every night since George Floyd was killed on May 25.</p>

<p>When the caravan veered from its intended route and entered the downtown area, violent clashes ensued.</p>

<p>The weekend also saw further protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, after Jacob Blake was shot in the back by a white police officer a week ago.</p>

<p>The gunman and the victim in Portland were both local people, with no need to board a plane.</p>

<p>Aaron Danielson, a supporter of the conservative group Patriot Prayer, was from Portland.</p>

<p>The man accused of his murder, Michael Forest Reinoehl, 48, was from Clackamas, just outside Portland. </p>

<p>Trump said: 'Portland has been burning for many years, for decades.'</p>

<p>He said the city was 'a disgrace'.</p>
