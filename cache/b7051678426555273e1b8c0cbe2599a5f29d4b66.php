<p>Stopped: Big Brother star Soobong Hwang (pictured) was stopped by police on Tuesday after accidentally crossing into the Victorian border</p>

<p>He continued: 'I went straight into Victorian border. And I said, "Oh no, I'm not supposed to be here!"' And I turn around. Caught by police.</p>

<p>'And he said, "If you go any further, you're not even coming back, so sorry man, you've got to go back to Adelaide." </p>

<p>'It's my silly mistake. I should've turned an hour ago.'</p>

<p>Soobong has happily been living in a van for the past three years.</p>

<p>Since his departure from Big Brother in June, the 48-year-old delivery truck driver returned to the comforts of his four-wheel home.</p>

<p>The father-of-three has been happily living in the parking lot of his local gym, where he trains every day.</p>

<p>In a video shared to Instagram after the incident, the 48-year-old said: 'I messed up.'</p>

<p>'I usually live in front of the gym,' the fitness fanatic told Daily Mail from his mobile home in South Australia in June. </p>

<p>'Once the gyms reopened [after coronavirus lockdowns lifted] I got back down to the gym. So, I'm living in front of the gym now.'</p>

<p>It's believed Soobong uses the shower and bathroom amenities at the gym, where he trains daily for one-and-a-half hours.</p>

<p>Soobong arrived at the Big Brother compound in a metal cage suspended by a crane, alongside three other latecomers, Shane Vincent, Hannah Campbell and Danni Keogh.</p>

<p>Despite his obvious physical advantages when it comes to the challenges, the others saw him as a threat and decided it was best to send him home sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>He was the third housemate to be evicted from the series, with 12 votes. </p>

<p>Before his entrance, a video package showed inside Soobong's cramped van, which featured a bed and portable camping stove.</p>

<p>'I've been living in my van, all by myself, for the last three years. And I love it! I've got everything I need within my reach,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is ultimate freedom,' he added. </p>
