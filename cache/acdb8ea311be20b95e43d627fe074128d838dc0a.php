<p>Rock solid: Gavin Rossdale, 54, showed off his ripped physique while playing tennis at some courts in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles on Thursday</p>

<p>With the sun glaring down on another warm Southern California day, Rossdale worked up a hearty sweat dressed only in camouflage shorts and red Nike sneakers.</p>

<p>He wore several leather strands around his neck, which was tied off to form a necklace, and a white headband that was used to keep his brown locks out of his face.</p>

<p>By going shirtless and being covered in sweat, the Everything Zen star's array of arm tattoos glistened under the bright sunlight. </p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Rossdale took to Instagram and shared a photo of himself posing on some rocks on a beach in scenic Malibu. </p>

<p>'i found my love on the beach -i found my love in the sand,' he wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>With the Pacific Ocean water crashing into the shore, the ex-husband of Gwen Stefani wore a pair of military green pants with a black sleeveless t-shirt and his hair slicked back off his face.  </p>

<p>Rossdale's band Bush would have been out on the road on tour in support of their eight studio album if it hadn't been for the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Rockers are back: Bush released their eighth studio album, The Kingdom, in July 2020</p>

<p>The Kingdom was slated for release in May but it was pushed back to July in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>Bush found immediate success, especially in the US, with the release of their debut album Sixteen Stone in 1994, during the grunge music heyday. It went 6X platinum behind such hits as Machinehead, Glycerine, Comedown and the aforementioned Everything's Zen.</p>

<p>Rossdale and Stefani shares three sons: Kingston, 14, Zuma, 12, and Apollo, six.</p>

<p>The former couple were married for about 13 years when the No Doubt frontwoman filed for divorce in August 2015.  </p>
