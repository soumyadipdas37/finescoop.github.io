<p>Mr Andrews was responding to allegations of police officers covering their name tags during anti-lockdown protests when he revealed he was stopped by cops in Melbourne on Saturday.  </p>

<p>'My vehicle was stopped on the way to the office this morning and the officer was clearly identifiable,' he told reporters. </p>

<p>'And I thanked him for the work that he and his colleagues were doing.'</p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured) was responding to allegations of police officers covering their name tags during anti-lockdown protests when he revealed he too was stopped by cops in Melbourne on Saturday</p>

<p>The Victorian Premier said he 'certainly hadn't heard or seen reports' of police officers covering their name tags and badges.  </p>

<p>Police have checkpoints around Melbourne to ensure that people are not travelling outside of a 5km radius of their homes, which is a Stage Four lockdown restriction. </p>

<p>People are allowed to travel outside of their radius for permitted work, which was the case with Mr Andrews. </p>

<p>More than 1,000 anti-lockdown protesters descended on Melbourne and clashed with police for a 'Freedom Day' rally on Saturday, which resulted in 15 arrests. </p>

<p>Police officers were out in force in Melbourne on Saturday to combat anti-lockdown protests. The Victorian Premier said he 'certainly hadn't heard or seen reports' of police officers covering their name tags and badges </p>

<p>One protester was arrested for assaulting a police officer, 14 were arrested for breaching COVID-19 restrictions and another 150 were fined on the spot.    </p>

<p>Mr Andrews said there was a 'very visible, very significant police presence in the city' in response to the protests. </p>

<p>'Some people have forecast that they intend to - in a selfish, dangerous and unlawful way - protest and put this strategy at risk. Police, I think, are taking very appropriate steps to deal with that,' he said. </p>

<p>The protests kicked off at the Shrine of Remembrance but coronavirus-deniers have later took to the streets, stopping traffic near Albert Park.     </p>
