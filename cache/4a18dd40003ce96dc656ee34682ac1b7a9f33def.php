<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A curious seal pup climbed aboard a sea kayak to pose for a photograph near the Sunderland coast in adorable snapshots.</p>

<p>Denise Walter was kayaking with her husband in Roker Harbour when the animal jumped up onto her boat earlier this week.</p>

<p>The pair were on a wildlife tour with Adventure Sunderland and had just seen a pod of dolphins leaping in and out of the water nearby. </p>

<p>After coming back into the harbour, Mrs Walter got the surprise of her life when the seal pup decided to hitch a ride on her kayak.</p>

<p>She said: 'We became interested in kayaking when we did it with our sons in Norway last year so when we found out about the wildlife tour at Adventure Sunderland, we keen to get involved.</p>

<p>'As we went across the harbour, a pod of dolphins were jumping in and out of the water, it was a great sight and then we continued out of the harbour.</p>

<p>'Just as we were returning, I suddenly felt a tap at the back of my kayak so I turned round to see a seal pup climbing on.'</p>

<p>Ms Walter's husband Adam, 66, added: 'It was such a unique experience as seals tend to be shy and stay away from people.</p>

<p>'The weather was lovely and hot and the sea was just so calm, nothing like I've seen before which I think added to be the experience.'    </p>

<p>Manager at Adventure Sunderland, Mike, who captured the images, had checked over the pup to make sure it didn't appear injured. </p>

<p>Once it was decided that it was in good health, the group attempted to return it back to the water- something which the pup seemed to 'enjoy'.</p>

<p>Mrs Walter said: 'Mike checked it over to ensure that it wasn't hurt and when we realised that it wasn't, we started to rock the kayak to encourage it back into the sea.</p>

<p>'Well it seemed to really enjoy it, before trying to swap kayaks from mine to Mike's. It was such a wonderful experience for me and I think the little pup enjoyed the ride.' </p>
