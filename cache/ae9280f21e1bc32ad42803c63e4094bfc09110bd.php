<p>In the post, she penned: 'Teachers, ur class convos are broadcasted in everyone's homes. The # of times the teacher has said 'your mom and dad' to my kid's class is infuriating.'</p>

<p>'But a BRAVE kid just said...'But I only told my grandma at lunch time because my sister and I live with our grandma'. </p>

<p>'Then of course my kid jumped in right away &amp; said: 'I don't have a dad &amp; it's ok because my mom said there are different kinds of families.</p>

<p>'Even though I would want a dad but she's gay. Gay means she only dates women.' LOL. Now my business is out there.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'But teacher apologized and said she'll start saying "parent or the adult helping you at home." I have faith in this generation.'</p>

<p>The post quickly garnered over 83, 000 likes and hundreds of comments from people praising her post. </p>
