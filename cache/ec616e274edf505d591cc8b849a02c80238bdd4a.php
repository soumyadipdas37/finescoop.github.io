<p>Prince Charles, pictured above in January this year, has been accused of taking draconian measures to preserve the appearance of his new estate in Cornwall</p>

<p>They are also prevented from slamming doors, and must even stick to rules about where they can place their house numbers.</p>

<p>The rules have been created to ‘protect the character’ of Nansledan, where neo-traditional properties costing up to £500,000, and built from local slate, echo 1930s architecture.</p>

<p>On Twitter, urban planner Peter Kelly said the code at ‘Prince Charles’s latest toy town… is pretty terrifying’.</p>

<p>Sources said the rules were set by the Duchy of Cornwall, not by the Prince himself.</p>
