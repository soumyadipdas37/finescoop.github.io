<p>Looking good! Victoria Beckham, 46, shared snaps of her daughter Harpers's perfectly styled hair on her Instagram page, after working her locks into neat French braids</p>

<p>The mother-of-four also share a before image of Harper's wild waves, before she tamed them into chic plaits.</p>

<p>Victoria, like most designers, opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week as the coronavirus pandemic uproots fashion weeks around the globe.</p>

<p>She shared Instagram snaps of husband David, 45, alongside sons Romeo, 18, Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper in face masks ahead of Monday afternoon's presentation.</p>

<p>Victoria captioned her snaps: 'My favourite (and only) guests this season! love you all so much <?php echo e('@'); ?>davidbeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>romeobeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>cruzbeckham #HarperSeven xx we missed you <?php echo e('@'); ?>brooklynbeckham <?php echo e('@'); ?>nicolannepeltz.'</p>

<p>The designer showed off her latest collection with the help of four models, while there was just a handful of fashion editors in attendance for a preview at Victoria Miro art gallery in East London on Sunday.</p>

<p>Guests at Sunday's preview all wore monogrammed face masks that were provided at the entrance of the gallery and social distancing was enforced.</p>

<p>Happy: Victoria was supported by husband David and their family on Monday as she prepared to unveil her digital presentation for London Fashion Week</p>

<p>The presentation was streamed on Victoria's website on Monday afternoon, meaning one of LFW's most anticipated shows was accessible to all.</p>

<p>Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons as well as eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz on Instagram.</p>

<p>Speaking to Grazia, Victoria explained that she spent a lot of time over lockdown wondering how she was going to present the collection.</p>

<p>She at first thought she would show the collection with a small presentation to just editors, before making a last minute decision to go digital and open up the LFW event to everyone.</p>

<p>'There is obviously more pressure on digital content — the video that we're going to be shooting today, the pictures that we take. … </p>

<p>'I think that the challenge this season has been less about the clothes and more about everything else. I always welcome change and challenge,' Victoria said.</p>

<p>Sweet: The designer shared snaps of husband David, sons Romeo, 18, and Cruz, 15, and daughter Harper, nine, donning their face masks ahead of the digital presentation</p>
