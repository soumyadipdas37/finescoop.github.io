<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a 'tabless' battery at the firm's live-streamed 'Battery Day' that had attendees sitting in their own Tesla watching the billionaire speak on a stage. </p>

<p>Musk shared the firm is currently producing the cell, dubbed 4680, at its pilot Fremont gigafactory -making it Tesla's first in-house battery.</p>

<p>Eliminating the tabs allows for continual motion through the system, which provides six times the power and enables a 16 percent range increase to vehicles. </p>

<p>Musk also revealed the firm plans to make 20 million electric vehicles a year, along with an affordable model for $25,000 that is also fully autonomous. </p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced a 'tabless' battery at the firm's live-streamed 'Battery Day' that showed attendees sitting in their own Tesla watching the billionaire speak on a stage</p>

<p>Musk called it the 'Tesla drive-in movie theater,' when he took the stage overlooking a parking lot of Tesla vehicles with attendees sitting inside to adhere to social distancing recommendations.</p>

<p>He joked, 'It's a little hard to read the room with everyone being in cars,' even as he was received by a chorus of honking horns.   </p>

<p>Musk also revealed his plans for Tesla to produce its own battery cells, which the firm has begun at its pilot Gigawatt facility in Fremont, California.</p>

<p>The factory pulled inspiration from facilities that work with filling bottles and making paper to design a way to keep continual motion through the assembly line.</p>

<p>The battery will power upcoming Tesla electric vehicles, including the heavy-duty Semi truck, the roadster and the futuristic Cybertruck - all of which were on display at the event. </p>

<p>The tabless battery, called 4860, is said to make the firm's electronic vehicles five times more energy dense, six times more powerful and increase the range by 16 percent</p>

<p>The battery is enclosed in a white tin, cylinder with blue trimming that have eliminated that traditional battery tabs inside.</p>

<p>The new cell manufacturing system is 'close to working' at the pilot plant level, Musk said. </p>

<p>Tesla will produce the new battery cells initially on a new assembly line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, with planned output reaching 10 gigawatt-hours a year by the end of 2021. </p>

<p>Tesla and partner Panasonic Corp now have production capacity of around 35 gWh at the Nevada battery 'gigafactory.' </p>

<p>Tesla will produce the new battery cells initially on a new assembly line near its vehicle plant in Fremont, California, with planned output reaching 10 gigawatt-hours a year by the end of 2021</p>

<p>Musk also note the firm aims to rapidly ramp up battery production over the next years, to 3 terawatt-hours a year, or 3,000 gigawatt-hours, roughly 85 times greater than the capacity of the Nevada plant.  </p>

<p>Musk's 'Cybertruck', which looks like an armored vehicle with a futuristic angular body in gunmetal grey, will go into production in 2021.</p>

<p>The pickup, which Musk said will cost $39,900 (£31,000) and up, will have an estimated battery range of up to 500 miles.  </p>

<p>Tesla boasts that the car's nearly impenetrable monochrome exoskeleton provides passengers maximum protection, together with ultra-strong glass that absorbs and redirects impact force. </p>

<p>The $200,000 Roadster sports car – an updated version of Tesla's first production vehicle from 2008 – can travel 620 miles on a single charge, a new record for an electric vehicle.</p>

<p>Its maximum speed is over 250 mph, which would make it the fastest car in general production.    </p>

<p>The Semi, meanwhile, which was unveiled in 2017, is a long silver cargo truck that can reach 60 miles per hour with an 80,000-pound load. </p>

<p>It has Tesla's semi-autonomous driving system, designed to keep a vehicle in its lane without drifting, and can transition from one freeway to another with no human intervention.  </p>

<p>Prior to the event, many had speculated the Musk was set to unveil the firm's highly-anticipated 'million-mile battery' that was said to clock up over a million miles over the course of their lifespan – rather than powering a car for a single million-mile-journey without recharging.</p>

<p>The battery will power upcoming Tesla electric vehicles, including the heavy-duty Semi truck, the roadster (pictured) and the futuristic Cybertruck - all of which were on display at the event. </p>

<p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk is taking on the heavy pickup truck market with the Cybertruck electric vehicle</p>

<p>Musk said in a tweet that the battery improvements to be unveiled will not be in high-volume production until 2022.</p>

<p>'Important note about Tesla Battery Day unveil tomorrow,' said Musk in a tweet early on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'This affects long-term production, especially Semi, Cybertruck &amp; Roadster, but what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022.'</p>

<p>In a tweet earlier this month, Musk said 'many exciting things will be unveiled on Battery Day'.</p>

<p>Tesla's 'Gigafactory' is located on Electric Avenue in Sparks, Nevada.</p>

<p>The factory's name stems from 'giga,' a unit of measurement that represents billions.</p>

<p>One gigawatt hour is the equivalent of generating one billion watts for one hour — one million times that of one kilowatt hour.</p>

<p>Tesla says the factory will be producing 35 gigawatt hours of batteries by 2018.</p>

<p>The current structure has a footprint of 1.9 million square feet, which houses 4.9 million square feet of operational space across several floors</p>

<p>It's currently about 30 percent finished - and once complete, it will be the biggest building in the world </p>

<p>That's the equivalent to the entire world's production in 2014.</p>

<p>New York City uses around 52 gigawatt hours of energy per year. </p>

<p>Once completed in 2020, the factory is set to become one of the biggest buildings in the world, with a final size of 10 million square feet.</p>

<p>Already, the current structure has a footprint of 1.9 million square feet, which houses 4.9 million square feet of operational space across several floors. </p>

<p>'Once complete, we expect the Gigafactory to be the biggest building in the world,' Tesla said.</p>
