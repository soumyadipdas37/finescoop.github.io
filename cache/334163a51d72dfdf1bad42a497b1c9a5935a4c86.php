<p>The mother-of-seven updated her 1.3million fans on Facebook on Tuesday, saying that doctors in Perth imagine it will be a 'very long road ahead' towards recovery, as Denim could be seen in a neck and arm brace. </p>

<p>'He did a real number on himself with the back broken in four places, seven ribs broken, two punctured lungs, a fractured shoulder and broken foot, then infections to fight... it's just a miracle he's here,' Constance, 36, wrote.</p>

<p>Denim was riding his motorbike with a friend in Perth on August 16 when he came off his bike and had to be airlifted to hospital. </p>

<p>Blogger Constance Hall has shared a photo of her husband Denim (pictured) in a trauma ward after a horror motorbike crash left him with seven broken ribs, punctured lungs and multiple infections</p>

<p>In happier times: Constance was initially worried that the 'fairly good knock' to the head Denim received when he fell would leave him incapable of speaking, but he 'literally cannot shut up'</p>

<p>'That along with the pain medication messes with his short term and long term memory quite a bit. Some days it breaks me and others he literally has me and the nurses in hysterics all day,' she said.</p>

<p>Denim, who has two children from a previous marriage, was moved from the ICU to a trauma ward earlier this week, and is hoping to be in  a long term rehabilitation centre soon. </p>

<p>According to Constance her husband has been regaling nurses with stories of his youth, but she has been assured this is all temporary. </p>

<p>'I have heard some of the most spiritually profound things about the other dimensions he's visited when he came out of his coma,' she said </p>

<p>'I have heard some of the most spiritually profound things about the other dimensions he's visited when he came out of his coma,' she said.</p>

<p>Constance has been splitting her time between the Perth hospital and Margaret River, where the couple live with their seven children, and relying on help from family and friends to watch their brood when she's away.  </p>

<p>Now - after two weeks of barely leaving Denim's side - she's ready to go back to working on her Queen The Label line. </p>

<p>'It is my passion and I feel a little deflated without it. I need to be strong and happy for Denz with something else to focus on,' she said.</p>

<p>Now - after two weeks of barely leaving Denim's side - she's ready to go back to working on her Queen The Label line </p>

<p>Their brood consists of Constance's four children Billie-Violet, Arlo Love, twins Rumi and Snow from her previous marriage, and Denim's two sons Zeyke and Sunny</p>

<p>She is preparing to release elastic belts on Thursday, which Denim was heavily involved in styling during the photoshoot stage, and feels it will 'honour' her husband.</p>

<p>Many of her followers have been calling on Constance to create a GoFundMe page so they can contribute to Denim's medical costs, but she directed them to instead buy from her online store. </p>

<p>'Charity in my position makes me really uncomfortable. Selling you rad products that we have put a hell of a lot of time and thought into and I know you will love makes me feel great,' she said.   </p>

<p>In previous posts Constance said her husband's accident was a wake up call on what matters most in their lives. </p>

<p>'The thought of losing him has made me realise how much needs to change in our home lives so we can start putting each other first again,' she said. </p>

<p>'It just sucks that I needed something this horrible to make me realise I had stopped appreciating everything he does for us all.'  </p>

<p>It comes after Constance initially asked to be 'left alone' immediately following the motorcycle crash.</p>

<p>'On Sunday afternoon Denz went for a motorbike ride with his mate. He had a serious accident and was flown to a hospital in Perth,' she said on August 18. </p>

<p>'For the children, his parents and Denz's sake the media just needs to leave us alone.</p>

<p>'At this point nobody knows anything. There is absolutely no way of telling what is going to happen. He is stable now and the most loved man in the world.' </p>

<p> Constance split from her former husband of six years Bill Mahon in April 2017 and was engaged to Denim two months later</p>
