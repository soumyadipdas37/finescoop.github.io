<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Tory London mayoral candidate wants to offer firms sponsorship deals to raise money for TfL meaning tube stations could be renamed.</p>

<p>Shaun Bailey plans to give companies the chance to bid to rename stations as part of a new advertising campaign inspired by the Dubai Metro.</p>

<p>The Conservative London mayoral candidate put forward the plans for a £100 million a year sponsorship deal according to The Telegraph.  </p>

<p>Shaun Bailey plans to give companies the chance to bid to rename stations as part of a new advertising campaign</p>

<p>Under these plans Knightsbridge Station could be renamed after Harrods, and Oxford Circus would be sponsored by brands with flagship stores nearby.      </p>

<p>Mr Bailey believes the initiative will raise up to half a billion pounds over five years for Transport for London (TfL).</p>

<p>He says it has been left with 'record levels of debt' by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.</p>

<p>Mr Bailey said that 'Dubai's entire Metro is barely the size of the District Line' (pictured, a commuter passing the Burj Khalifa, Dubai) </p>

<p>This has worked in major cities across the globe including Dubai, Madrid and New York. </p>

<p>Mr Bailey believes the size of the London Underground could generate higher revenues than in Dubai which has raised more than £300 million. </p>

<p>There have only been branding of 21 stations across the network with 10-year sponsorship deals with firms including Emirates and First Gulf Bank.  </p>

<p>Mr Bailey believes the size of the London Underground could generate higher revenues than in Dubai which has raised more than £300 million</p>

<p>Mr Bailey said: 'We need to fix the service that Londoners love. That's why I'll invite businesses to sponsor station names and Tube lines.</p>

<p>'Dubai makes £419 million through sponsorship. And Dubai's entire Metro is barely the size of the District Line.' </p>
