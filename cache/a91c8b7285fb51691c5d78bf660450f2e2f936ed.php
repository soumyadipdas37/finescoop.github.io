<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Washing your nose and mouth with an iodine solution could prevent you from being infected with the novel coronavirus, a new study suggests.</p>

<p>In a laboratory, researchers poured solutions of the antiseptic povidone-iodine (PVP-I) at three different concentrations on a sample of the virus.</p>

<p>They found that even a concentration of just 0.5 percent completely inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in as little as 15 seconds.</p>

<p>The team, from the University of Connecticut School of Medicine, says the rinses could prevent person-to-person spread of the virus and prevent a severe cases by decreasing the amount of virus that travels to the lungs.  </p>

<p>A new study from the University of Connecticut found that, after 15 seconds, a solution of iodine completely inactivated a sample of coronavirus, even at the lowest concentration (file image)</p>

<p>It is well-known that the nose contains high levels of the receptor ACE-2, which the virus uses to enter and infect human cells.</p>

<p>Therefore, several clinical trials have focused on nasal irrigations and washes as a way to curb the pandemic, which has killed nearly 200,000 Americans. </p>

<p>Previous research has found that PVP-I has been effective at inactivating pathogens related to the new virus including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.</p>

<p>For the study, published in JAMA Otolaryngology–Head &amp; Neck Surgery, the team tested samples of the virus against solutions in which PVP-I was the sole active ingredient.</p>

<p>The solution was diluted at three different concentrations, 0.5 percent, 1.25 percent, and 2.5 percent.</p>

<p>PVP-I concentrations were then compared with a 70 percent ethanol solution and watched for reactions after 15 seconds and 30 seconds.</p>

<p>All three iodine antiseptics, even the one at the lowest concentration, completely inactivated the virus within 15 seconds of contact.</p>

<p>However,  the ethanol control was not able to completely kill SARS-CoV-2 over the same time period.</p>

<p>This study demonstrates that a contact time of 15 seconds is sufficient for viral inactivation,' the authors wrote.</p>

<p>'Widespread use of PVP-I nasal antiseptic in patients prior to intranasal procedures could significantly decrease risk of virus transmission via droplet and aerosol spread.'</p>

<p>They add that clinicians could instruct patients to rinse their noses with PVP-I before appointments or procedures to avoid spread in waiting rooms or other common areas.</p>

<p>What's more, researchers say this could lower the risk of someone contracting a severe case of COVID-19 by decreasing the viral load that travels to the lungs. </p>

<p>'Povidone-iodine nasal irrigation may be beneficial for the population at large as an adjunct to mask usage as a means of virus mitigation,' the authors wrote.</p>

<p>However, don't try this at home. The teams says this nasal wash is best done under clinical supervision. </p>
