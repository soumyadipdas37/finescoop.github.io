<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United are monitoring Valencia star Uros Racic but have not made an offer for the midfielder, according to reports in Spain.</p>

<p>The Sun claim United are weighing up a £28million (€30m) move for the Serbian and are hopeful that fee will be sufficient due to the Valencia's financial problems.</p>

<p>But Valencia-based journalist Hector Gomez reports that while United's interest in Racic is very real, his camp have denied any bid for the 22-year-old - who has a £92million release clause in his contract at the Spanish outfit - being placed.</p>

<p>Manchester United are monitoring Valencia star Uros Racic (right) but have not bid for him</p>

<p>'Racic's camp confirm interest from Manchester United for the player but NOT the €30m offer. Let's see if there really is a final offer or if it only remains as interest,' Gomez tweeted.</p>

<p>A box-to-box midfielder, the 22-year-old central midfielder is known for adding defensive power and a tireless work ethic to the team.</p>

<p>The Sun also report he is equally adept with his feet and is not opposed to the idea of shooting with either foot, and idolises current United star Paul Pogba. </p>

<p>The Serbian starlet made his first senior appearance for Valencia off the bench in their 4-2 La Liga win against Levante on Sunday.</p>

<p>But he has generally failed to settle in Valencia after joining the La Liga outfit from Red Star Belgrade in the summer of 2018.</p>

<p>He has been out on loan spells since arriving at the Mestalla, last season turning out for both Famalicao in Portugal and Spanish outfit Tenerife.</p>

<p>United are also interested in signing Real Madrid outcast Gareth Bale on loan this summer</p>

<p>But should he arrive at United he will provide further competition to compatriot Nemanja Matic in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s crowded midfield.</p>

<p>As revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, United are also eyeing a dramatic swoop for Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale.</p>

<p>The Red Devils' hopes of landing first-choice target Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund appear to be fading, leading them to turn to Madrid outcast Bale who could arrive on a season-long loan. </p>
