<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former first lady Michelle Obama urged Americans not to be turned off of politics by Tuesday night's trainwreck of a presidential debate, arguing that would be playing into President Donald Trump's hands. </p>

<p>'But we can’t let him win by tuning out altogether,' she wrote Wednesday evening on Instagram. 'We've got to vote for Joe [Biden] in numbers that cannot be denied.'   </p>

<p>As Obama was making her plea, Biden was being greeted by hundreds of supporters in Greensburg, Pennsylvania - the county seat of Westmoreland County, which Biden and President Barack Obama lost to Republican presidential nominees in both 2008 and 2012. </p>

<p>Michelle Obama urged people not to be turned off after Tuesday night's nasty presidential debate imploring Americans to 'vote for Joe [Biden] in numbers that can't be denied'</p>

<p>Michelle Obama posted the plea to her Instagram account, explaining that she believed President Donald Trump wants American to be tuned out </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Democratic nominee Joe Biden was greeting some of the largest crowd he's seen since the coronavirus crisis hit in March </p>

<p>Taking an Amtrak train through Ohio and Pennsylvania Wednesday, Joe Biden greeted hundreds of supporters in Greensburg, Pennsylvania in the early evening </p>

<p>Greensburg is the county seat of Westmoreland County where voters twice picked the Republican nominee over the Obama-Biden ticket in 2008 and 2012 </p>

<p>Unlike Hillary Clinton, who didn't spend much time campaigning outside of Pittsburgh, Biden made a number of stops Wednesday on his train tour through Ohio and Pennsylvania in towns that don't scream Democratic.  </p>

<p>In both Alliance, Ohio and Greensburg, Pennsylvania Biden was greeted by the largest crowds the candidate has seen since the coronavirus crisis hit in March. </p>

<p>In Greensburg, supporters chanted 'We want Joe! We want Joe!' as the former vice president tossed his hands up as he came to say hello. </p>

<p>Most in the crowd looked to be wearing masks, a departure from Trump's supporters. </p>

<p>One supporter who talked to the pool, 77-year-old Harriet Ellenberger, said the nasty presidential debate inspired her to come out and see Biden. </p>

<p>'After last night's episode on TV I was so depressed that I thought I should really come out and show him support,' Ellenberger said.  </p>

<p>Another crowd was waiting for Biden in nearby Latrobe - also in Westmoreland County - where the ex-veep will also make a stop. </p>

<p>In 2008, Obama and Biden lost Westmoreland County to Sen. John McCain and Gov. Sarah Parlin 41 per cent to 58 per cent. </p>

<p>It's become more Republican since. </p>

<p>Romney pulled 61.3 per cent of the vote in 2012, compared to Obama and Biden's 37.6 per cent. </p>

<p>In 2016 Trump trounced the Democratic ticket 64.1 per cent to 32.7 per cent.   </p>

<p>Biden's last stop on his train tour will be in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, a formerly blue city and the largest in Cambria County.  </p>

<p>In 2008, Obama and Biden won the county by two points - 50 per cent to 48 per cent. </p>

<p>It's dramatically become more GOP-friendly.  </p>

<p>There was a 10-point swing in 2012, with Obama-Biden earning 40.2 per cent to Romney's 58 per cent. </p>

<p>And then nearly another 10-point swing in 2016 when Trump was atop the ticket: 29.6 per cent for Clinton-Kaine and 67.3 per cent for Trump-Pence. </p>

<p>Polling in Pennsylvania has Biden ahead, however recent Trump rallies in both Latrobe and Pittsburgh have brought out crowds that numbered in the thousands.    </p>
