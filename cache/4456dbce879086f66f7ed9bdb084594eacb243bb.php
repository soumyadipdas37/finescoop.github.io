<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Government has decided to keep Portugal and Greece on the quarantine-free list, despite days of speculation over soaring cases sparking holidaymakers to make a scramble home tonight. </p>

<p>Following a week of speculation, the Transport Minister tweeted today: 'We continue to keep the Travel Corridor list under constant review &amp; won't hesitate to remove countries if needed. </p>

<p>'However, there are no English additions or removals today. </p>

<p>'Nonetheless, holidaymakers are reminded - 14-day quarantine countries can &amp; do change at very short notice.'</p>

<p>There has been widespread speculation this week that Portugal could be added to the UK's quarantine list - but today Grant Shapps has announced there will be no changes </p>

<p>Sources told MailOnline that although Portugal was above the 'trigger' threshold for cases per 100,000 people over a seven-day period, that appeared to be because they were carrying out more tests.</p>

<p>'The rate of positives per test has actually gone down,' one senior source said. </p>

<p>More to follow. </p>

<p>The rate of coronavirus cases per 100,000 of population in Greece over the past seven days is just 14 - well short of the government's quarantine threshold of 20</p>
