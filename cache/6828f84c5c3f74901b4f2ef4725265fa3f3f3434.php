<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The transfer window is well underway, with deals coming thick and fast as clubs look to bolster their squads ahead of the new season – which is just over a week away.</p>

<p>Clubs have until October 5 to wrap up their business but complications caused by the ongoing pandemic mean they'll be keen to get their signings in sooner in time for pre-season training.</p>

<p>Though Lionel Messi has announced he will stay at the Nou Camp there are still a few loose ends to tie up.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail's TOBY MILES will provide live updates from Premier League and European clubs as they continue to negotiate and complete signings during the summer transfer window.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Barcelona are 'ramping up their pursuit' of Lyon attacker Memphis Depay as a replacement for Luis Suarez.</p>

<p>With the Uraguayan set to leave the Nou Camp, Ronald Koeman is very keen on bringing a new striker into the club.</p>

<p>Barcelona are reportedly considering a move for ex-player Thiago Alcantara this summer, but new boss Ronald Koeman prefers a pursuit of Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum. </p>

<p>Bayern Munich playmaker Thiago, who is currently on international duty with Spain, has just a year left on his contract and has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League, with Liverpool and Manchester United interested. </p>

<p>Juventus could turn back the clock as Andrea Pirlo is reportedly interested in bringing Alvaro Morata back to the club.</p>

<p>The new Juventus boss is very keen on signing a striker during the summer transfer window and has been heavily linked with Barcelona star Luis Suarez. </p>

<p>Christian Eriksen has sensationally been placed on the transfer list by Inter Milan just a matter of months after his move to Italy. For an offer of around £35million, the Serie A giants would be willing to allow the playmaker to leave.</p>

<p>The preferred 3-5-2 formation of Antonio Conte has often forced Eriksen to settle for a spot on the sidelines, and the enigmatic Italian coach is certain he can lead the club back to glory should they grant him his wishes this summer.</p>

<p>Newcastle United’s £20mIllion offer for Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson has been accepted, Sportsmail understands. </p>

<p>Aston Villa - who offered £21m on Saturday - have withdrawn their interest as Newcastle is the player’s preferred club.</p>

<p>Jamie Carragher says that if Manchester United don't sign Jadon Sancho this summer they risk losing him to Liverpool next year.</p>

<p>And the former Champions League winner with Liverpool says that signing Sancho is crucial if United wish to close the gap on Liverpool and Manchester City and move closer to challenging for the title.</p>

<p>Liverpool have reportedly informed Barcelona that they want £15million for midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum.</p>

<p>Recently-appointed Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman, who managed Wijnaldum when in charge of the Dutch national team, is eager to work with the 29-year-old again.</p>

<p>Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi will reportedly be offered a new contract at Stamford Bridge this summer, before heading out on loan with a number of Premier League clubs interested in the Belgian. </p>

<p>Batshuayi was handed chances in the first-team last season under Frank Lampard, but after Timo Werner joined during this window, the 26-year-old is now further down the pecking order up front and is effectively fourth-choice behind Werner, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud. </p>

<p>Good morning and welcome to another day of summer transfer business.</p>

<p>With plenty more deals in the works, we'll bring you all the latest updates and rumours here.</p>
