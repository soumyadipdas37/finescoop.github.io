<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Bromwich Albion have opened talks with Watford over their interest in striker Troy Deeney.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed the Baggies interest in the Hornets captain last week and negotiations are now underway.</p>

<p>Watford chief executive Scott Duxbury and WBA sporting director Luke Dowling are at the forefront of talks between both clubs.</p>

<p>West Bromwich Albion have entered talks with Watford over talismanic striker Troy Deeney</p>

<p>The striker was part of the Hornets side that was relegated from the Premier League last term</p>

<p>Dowling has close links at Vicarage Road having left the club he held the role as sporting director in 2017.</p>

<p>The Baggies chiefs knows Deeney, 32, from his three year spell at Watford and is keen to tie up a deal.</p>

<p>Deeney, given his experience and standing as a proven top-flight goalscorer, is attracting interest from a number of Premier League teams with Tottenham among the clubs monitoring his situation.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old's sale could be used to raise funds for Watford, with Tottenham also keen</p>

<p>But WBA appear to be leading the chase to sign the centre-forward.Â </p>

<p>Watford are open to selling the striker as they look to balance the books following their relegation last season.</p>

<p>Indeed, Deeney is one of a clutch of players who is not required to take a pay reduction following their relegation which increases the likelihood of the club listening to offers for the talismanic skipper.</p>
