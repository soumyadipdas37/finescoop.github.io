<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham have stolen a march on their Premier League rivals Fulham by making an opening bid for Napoli's £14m-rated centre back Nikola Maksimovic, according to reports.</p>

<p>West Ham are desperate to bolster their defence before the end of the transfer window, especially given their opening two results of the campaign, and the 28-year-old is top of their wish-list.</p>

<p>Sky Sport Italia report that the Hammers have now made an offer for Maksimovic, whose current contract runs out next summer with him failing to agree terms on an extension with the Serie A club.</p>

<p>The centre back (right) could leave Napoli and both West Ham and Fulham are interested</p>

<p>The two parties are currently said to be in negotiations, with Napoli keen to secure between £14m and £19m for their player.</p>

<p>It is understood Fulham are also keeping a keen eye on developments as they continue their search for a centre back after a deal with Sassuolo for Marlon collapsed.</p>

<p>Napoli are expected to be willing to sell a centre back in the window, and look likely to keep Kalidou Koulibaly despite huge interest from the likes of Manchester City. If he does stay, then Maksimovic is likely to be the man to depart.</p>

<p>Kalidou Koulibaly staying at Napoli could make way for Maksimovic to move to pastures new</p>

<p>David Moyes is desperate to add some defensive strength after two early league defeats</p>

<p>West Ham's need for more defensive firepower comes after they were beaten 2-0 by Newcastle and 2-1 by Arsenal in their opening two Premier League matches.</p>

<p>The Hammers did then go on to provide perhaps the shock of the season so far to smash four without reply past Wolves on Sunday night.  </p>

<p>David Moyes' side travel to Everton in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday night, before a Premier League trip to Leicester on Sunday lunchtime. </p>
