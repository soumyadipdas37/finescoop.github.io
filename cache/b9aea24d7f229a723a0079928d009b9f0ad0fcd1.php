<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sheffield United are closing in on a £10million deal for Derby duo Jayden Bogle and Max Lowe.</p>

<p>Right-back Bogle, 20, and left-back Lowe, 23, were not in the squad as Derby beat Barrow on penalties in the first round of the Carabao Cup on Saturday.</p>

<p>Derby boss Phillip Cocu said Bogle had a minor injury but did not refute the idea they might be on their way out of Pride Park to generate funds to sign attacking players.</p>

<p>Jayden Bogle missed Derby's Carbao Cup shootout win over Barrow due to a minor injury</p>

<p>But he is set to join Sheffield United along with Max Lowe (above) in a £10million switch</p>

<p>'If they leave I am expecting we will have the funds to strengthen,' said Cocu.</p>

<p>The Blades were in pre-season action Friday, playing out a 2-2 draw against Preston North End at Bramall Lane.</p>

<p>Chris Wilder's side will be among the last sides getting their Premier League campaign underway from next weekend when they host Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday night.</p>
