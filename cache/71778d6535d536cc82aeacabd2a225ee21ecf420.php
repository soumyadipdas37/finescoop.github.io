<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crew members on the International Space Station still haven't found the source of an air leak that was first detected a year ago.  </p>

<p>NASA officials first detected air leaking from the space station, which floats in low Earth orbit at an altitude of 254 miles, in September 2019. </p>

<p>Despite getting more severe in the past year, the leak is allegedly too small to present an immediate danger to the lives of the on board crew. </p>

<p>But the recent surge in air loss, which suggests the hole is getting bigger, means NASA can't put off finding the source any longer. </p>

<p>Most of the station's modules have already been ruled out as the location of the offending hole or gap, according to a NASA official. </p>

<p>Staff on the ground should be forming conclusions on the source of the leak in the coming days, which should help the three astronauts on board seal it off. </p>

<p>The ISS has been under constant occupation by astronauts since November 2000 but due to structural fatigue needs to be decommissioned by 2030</p>

<p>NASA spokesman Daniel Huot told Business Insider that the search is 'taking longer than expected'. </p>

<p>'The leak rate is still stable and well below the design specifications for the station and presents no concern for crew or vehicle safety,' he said.  </p>

<p>On August 20, NASA confirmed that the three ISS astronauts – NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy and Roscosmos cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner – would be spending a weekend in the Russian section of the ISS as part of a plan of action. </p>

<p>While in the Zvezda service module of the Russian section, the crew members closed all hatches on the station, allowing Earth-based officials to monitor air pressure levels and find the source of the leak.  </p>

<p>Commander Chris Cassidy and his crewmates Ivan Vagner and Anatoly Ivanishin stayed in the Zvezda service module for a weekend late August </p>

<p>At the time, NASA and Roscosmos said the situation represented no immediate danger to the crew or to the space station but that it was important to find the source. </p>

<p>Technical teams are still reviewing data collected by the crew during their weekend in Zvezda and have already ruled out most of the station's modules, Huot said.</p>

<p>They will complete their review 'in the coming days', he was quoted as saying by Business Insider. </p>

<p>However, there's a possibility it still can't be pinpointed, which will require a fresh course of action. </p>

<p>Generally, tiny amounts of air leak from a space vessel over time, requiring routine repressurisation from nitrogen tanks delivered on cargo resupply missions. </p>

<p>The station’s atmosphere is maintained at pressure comfortable for the crew members.  </p>

<p>But if the leak were to become more sizeable, these resupply missions may not be able to replace air quickly enough.  </p>

<p>NASA and its international partners first saw indications of a slight increase above the standard cabin air leak rate back in September 2019. </p>

<p>'Because of routine station operations like spacewalks and spacecraft arrivals and departures, it took time to gather enough data to characterise those measurements,' NASA admitted last month. </p>

<p>'That rate has slightly increased, so the teams are working a plan to isolate, identify, and potentially repair the source.' </p>

<p>This isn't the first leak on the ISS – two years ago, the space station's crew discovered a 2-millimetre (0.08 inches) hole on the outer wall of the Soyuz capsule on the orbiting laboratory, which they had to plug with epoxy and gauze. </p>

<p>August 2018 saw astronauts rush to fix a hole (pictured) which had appeared in the outer wall of the Soyuz capsule on the orbiting laboratory. Its origins are still a mystery </p>

<p>Russian media reports that Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Roscosmos, knew the hole's source, but wouldn't disclose it to NASA. </p>

<p>'We know exactly what happened, but we will not tell you anything,' Rogozin said in September 2019, as quoted by Russian news agency Ria Novosti.  </p>

<p>The exact cause of the breach was thought to be a botched repair job by an engineer who drilled through the side of the spacecraft.</p>

<p>However, some made allegations of subterfuge and deliberate sabotage.   </p>

<p>The International Space Station (ISS) is a $100 billion (£80 billion) science and engineering laboratory that orbits 250 miles (400 km) above Earth.</p>

<p>It has been permanently staffed by rotating crews of astronauts and cosmonauts since November 2000. </p>

<p>Research conducted aboard the ISS often requires one or more of the unusual conditions present in low Earth orbit, such as low-gravity or oxygen.</p>

<p>ISS studies have investigated human research, space medicine, life sciences, physical sciences, astronomy and meteorology.</p>

<p>The US space agency, Nasa, spends about $3 billion (£2.4 billion) a year on the space station program, a level of funding that is endorsed by the Trump administration and Congress.</p>

<p>A U.S. House of Representatives committee that oversees Nasa has begun looking at whether to extend the program beyond 2024.</p>

<p>Alternatively the money could be used to speed up planned human space initiatives to the moon and Mars.</p>
