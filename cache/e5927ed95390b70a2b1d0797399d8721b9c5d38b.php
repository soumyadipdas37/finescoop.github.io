<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A burglar penned a handwritten note from behind bars threatening to make his victim's 'baby girl' disappear if the father didn't retract the statement he made to police. </p>

<p>Jordan Constable, 36, also offered to pay the victim $10,000 in exchange for positive statements while he was on remand at Fulham Correctional Centre in Victoria's south-east.</p>

<p>The threatening letter was sent to the victim's Hallam home, in Melbourne's south-east, in March 2019 when the 36-year-old was in custody for the crime. </p>

<p>'I see how much you adore and love your baby girl … it would be hard as (a) father knowing you could prevent your daughter disappearing but did nothing, or the wrong move instead of following orders and making a healthy 10k of which will help your retirement,' the letter read.</p>

<p>'Don't f**k this up – for your baby girl's sake.'</p>

<p>Last month Constable pleaded guilty to attempting to pervert the course of justice at the Victorian County Court, NCA Newswire reported.</p>

<p>On Thursday he was spared jail time and was instead sentenced to a three-year community corrections order. </p>

<p>The letter arrived at the victim's house about two months after Constable robbed it, and the victim immediately reported it to police.</p>

<p>Constable, a father of five, was then sentenced to 217 days jail and an 18-month community corrections order for the burglary in September 2019.</p>

<p>'I really don't care exactly what is said just retract all negative statements against Jordan all items returned as his possessions, make a positive statement … you are covered by insurance so make sure you get IT DONE!!,' Constable wrote in the letter.</p>

<p>Constable told the victim to tell police he was 'emotional' on the day he gave the 'negative' statement and to instead make up a story that 'Jordan is a close friend of the family'.</p>

<p>While the letter had been signed 'Mr K', analysis from another letter matched Constable's handwriting. </p>

<p>He wrote the threatening letter while on remand at Fulham Correctional Centre (pictured)</p>

<p>The victim and his wife said they had been 'devastated' by the crime and the danger their daughter - who was pregnant at the time - was in.</p>

<p>The victim's wife told the court that Constable had 'invaded every inch' of their life.</p>

<p>She asked her daughter to move interstate with her husband out of fear for her safety.</p>

<p>Judge Michael McInerney issued a warning to Constable, saying if he breaches his community corrections order he will be sent 'straight to jail'.</p>

<p>Prosecutors pushed for Constable to be jailed for the letter but his defence lawyer said it was 'spontaneous' as he was recovering from a drug addiction.</p>

<p>Constable will have to undergo drug tests and offender behaviour therapy while completing 200 hours of community work as part of the order.</p>

<p>He was also ordered to pay $3,000.  </p>
