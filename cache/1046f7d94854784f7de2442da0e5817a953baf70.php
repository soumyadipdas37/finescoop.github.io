<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A fisherman who cast a line in a croc-infested waterway has been filmed moments away from becoming a saltwater predator's catch of the day.</p>

<p>Footage of the close encounter at Cahills Crossing in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park shows the angler quickly reeling in a fish as a crocodile approaches the bridge he was casting from.</p>

<p>The large animal can be seen swimming toward the man's catch in the murky water nearby before turning to face him as he reels it in.</p>

<p>As soon as the man has the fish in hand, he turns to walk away but does a double take and scurries back to pick an item off the ground. </p>

<p>The shocking moment, which was shared on social media on August 27, was watched by two others in the background.</p>

<p>A woman behind the camera can be heard nervously laughing at situation as she predicts the man's actions.</p>

<p>'He's going to get it out before he gets to him,' she says.  </p>

<p>The horrifying encounter was filmed just days before a 4.4 metre, 250kg saltwater male crocodile was trapped in the Flora River Nature Park - about 120 kilometres south-west of Katherine and about three hours from Kakadu National Park.  </p>

<p>It was the largest croc caught in the Flora River by local rangers in about five years.</p>

<p>The August 27 encounter was filmed just days before a 4.4 metre, 250kg male saltwater croc (pictured) was trapped in the Flora River Nature Park - about 120 kilometres south-west of Katherine and about three hours from Kakadu National Park</p>

<p>The catch followed a 3.3 metre male saltwater croc (pictured) being caught in the Katherine River - 55 kilometres downstream of Katherine - last week</p>

<p>Cahills Crossing has had a string of other near-death experiences with locals and tourists getting up close and personal with huge packs of crocs. </p>

<p>Last month a tourist was spotted sitting on the edge of the croc-infected riverbank, trying to lure in one of the predators by slapping the water with a stick for a selfie. </p>

<p>Campbell and Cheryl Brodie, who were horrified to see the man so close to the animals while visiting from South Australia, said they spotted at least a dozen crocs lurking in the water and were bracing themselves for the man to be taken.  </p>

<p>'I decided to take the photo of him squatting there so we could ID him to the cops,' Mr Brodie told the NT News. </p>

<p>'We counted 11 crocs in the area in front of the viewing platform and a couple on the lower side.' </p>

<p>At one stage the selfie taker was within five metres of a crocodile and was even splashing the water with his hand to draw them in.</p>

<p>The couple repeatedly told him to stay back but he ignored their warnings.</p>

<p>The Cahills Crossing encounter also followed a tourist being filmed sitting on the edge of the croc-infected riverbank (pictured), trying to lure in one of the predators by slapping the water with a stick for a selfie </p>

<p>Cahills Crossing is notorious for having large numbers of crocodiles as tourists race to get through unscathed</p>

<p>Despite the string of danger signs surrounding the crossing, the man told the couple he simply wanted to get a closer look.</p>

<p>'He showed no fear or concern for his own safety,' Mr Brodie said, adding the man luckily survived.</p>

<p>Rachelle Wastle and her husband Peter were driving through the crossing in early August when they were blocked by a dozen crocodiles.</p>

<p>Terrifying video footage shows the couple's car submerged into water as they attempted to cross to the other side of the river. </p>

<p>Mrs Wastle told Daily Mail Australia she and her husband had been taking advantage of the Northern Territory's long weekend and had been camping in Cobourg Peninsula.</p>

<p>The couple were returning to their home in Darwin.</p>

<p>'We were fine with the crocodiles, we are used to them now,' she said.</p>

<p>'We had been camping in an area where you walk along the beach and a crocodile would appear two metres in front of you.'</p>

<p>The crocodiles eventually began to move out of the way of the vehicle in chase of food.</p>

<p>Crocodiles are a common occurrence at the crossing and one 40-year-old man, Kerry McLoughlin was tragically taken and decapitated by one in 1987. </p>

<p>Visitors continue to flock to the area.</p>

<p>A group of saltwater crocodiles are seen swimming at Cahills Crossing in the Northern Territory</p>

<p>Video footage captured the terrifying moment a couple were stuck in the middle of Cahills Crossing (pictured), a popular spot in Kakadu National Park, notorious for saltwater crocodiles</p>

<p>In 2019, shocking footage emerged of a croc stealing a fisherwoman's catch of the day at a popular spot known for being infected with saltwater predators.</p>

<p>The footage of the woman quickly retreating backwards at Cahills Crossing in the Northern Territory's Kakadu National Park made headlines around the country.</p>

<p>She dashed out of frame before another man appeared to attempt to scoop up the large fish but failed when he was scared off by the oncoming croc.</p>

<p>The saltwater giant was seen launching itself from the water onto the bridge and quickly moving toward the fish.</p>

<p>It then turned its head to the left and smacks its teeth down on the woman's catch before gobbling it up in eight bites.</p>

<p>Standing proudly for a brief moment, it slowly retreated to the murky water.  </p>

<p>The infamous Cahills Crossing is only a few metres wide, but it's one of Australia's most dangerous bodies of water.</p>

<p>Along with varying tides, the water flow is strong enough to overturn vehicles, and it serves as a feeding ground for saltwater crocodiles.</p>

<p>Dozens of divers try to venture across the submerged crossing, but end up being washed in to croc-infested waters.</p>

<p>Many have lost their lives, including fisherman, children, photographers, and backpackers.</p>

<p>Crocodile expert Grahame Webb said for every crocodile you can see, there are 10 you can't.</p>

<p>The most famous fatality at the Crossing was in 1897 when 40-year-old Kerry McLoughlin was decapitated by a crocodile on a fishing trip.</p>

<p>Rangers counted 120 crocodiles in the six-kilometre stretch around Cahills Crossing.</p>

<p>There have been five fatalities in the area so far.</p>
