<p>Wolves are set to sign young Liverpool defender Ki-Jana Hoever for a fee in excess of £10m</p>

<p>Hoever - who joined the Reds from Ajax in 2018 - signed a new long-term contract last summer and it was thought he could head out on loan this season.</p>

<p>However, he is now set to join Wolves on a permanent deal after terms were agreed between the clubs.</p>

<p>Wolves sold right wing-back Matt Doherty to Spurs this summer and Hoever is seen as an option on the right and in the centre of the defence.</p>
