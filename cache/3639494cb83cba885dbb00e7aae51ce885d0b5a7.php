<p>The video begins with water seen creeping under double doors in the basement of the hospital. One of the doors bursts open and the floodwater comes surging in, knocking out a desk chair in the corridor and sending it hurtling along the floor</p>

<p>The water continues to gush in before the door is completely ripped off by the force of nature and the second door blasts violently open. The water soon reaches the level of the handrail</p>

<p>One of the doors bursts open and the floodwater comes surging in, knocking out a desk chair in the corridor and sending it hurtling along the floor.  </p>

<p>The water continues to gush in before the door is completely ripped off by the force of nature and the second door blasts violently open. </p>

<p>The waves wipe out the chair completely and rapidly flow inside the hospital, soon reaching the level of the handrail on the wall. </p>

<p>Video taken from another camera shows water seeping underneath another set of double doors.</p>

<p>The doors suddenly buckle under the water and burst open with the waves rapidly surging into the room. </p>

<p>Hospital staff said the encounter was like the scene out of a movie and told how they had to run for safety from the torrent of water flooding in the basement.  </p>

<p>'It was something like a movie, it was like we were running away from water when it burst open all the doors in the basement,' Michael Ware told Boston 25 News at the time. </p>

<p>'Kitchen appliances everything in the basement is currently floating even if it's heavy, it doesn't matter it's floating. Fridge, a vending machine, the wall broke.' </p>

<p>The hospital was forced to evacuate more than 100 patients from the facility as the water continued on its path into the ICU and electrical issues and loss of power was reported throughout the building. </p>

<p>No one was injured in the incident.   </p>

<p>The extreme weather event came as storms surged through the southeast region of the state late June, sparking a flash flood emergency in the Norwood area.  </p>

<p>Outside the hospital, emergency crews worked to rescue drivers stranded in their cars in the floodwaters while hundreds of homes were also left without power due to the storms. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for Norwood Hospital told DailyMail.com in a statement the 'unprecedented flooding' caused 'significant damage to the hospital'.  </p>

<p>'Water entered the building from all six sides, including through the roof and up from the floor,' they said.</p>

<p>It isn't clear when the hospital will be welcoming patients again but the spokesperson said officials were 'working day and night' to get it back up and running. </p>

<p>'Patients safety is our top priority. We are working day and night to assess the damage and formulate a plan and timeline for next steps,' the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>'Based on the extent of the flooding, we need to check every piece of equipment, every outlet, every inch of drywall for damage in order to be 100 percent sure that there is no risk to our patients now our in the future.'</p>
