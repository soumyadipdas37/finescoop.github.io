<p>Handsome couple Shelby and Sam have had a turbulent relationship, which was well documented on TOWIE. </p>

<p>The duo began sleeping with each other on a 'friends with benefits' basis but things soon turned sour when Sam decided to pursue a romance with TOWIE newbie Demi Sims while on a group trip to Thailand last year.</p>

<p>During a heated row, the fiery star called the brunette a 's**g' but months later, the pair decided to give things another go.</p>

<p>However, they were met with opposition when Shelby's close friend Clelia Theodorou told her she had felt deserted because the influencer was spending all her time with the hunk.</p>

<p>The former BFF's had several bitter rows, with Clelia, 25, accusing her of not being there for her when she was at her lowest point after splitting from her boyfriend, who is Sam's pal.  </p>

<p>Shelby and Sam decided to step back from TOWIE in order to focus on their romance later that year, and have been going strong ever since. </p>
