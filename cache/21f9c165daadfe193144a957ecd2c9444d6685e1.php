<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When England’s women take on West Indies tomorrow in Derby, it will be more than six months since their dream of contesting the T20 World Cup final in front of a full house at the MCG was scuppered by the weather.</p>

<p>This will be their first game since that miserable afternoon in Sydney, when a washed-out semi-final – and the lack of a reserve day – allowed India to go through instead because of a superior record in the group stage. </p>

<p>And according to England’s coach Lisa Keightley, there is still ‘fire in the belly’ as they embark on a five-match T20 series organised at late notice following the Covid-related withdrawals of India and South Africa.</p>

<p>England are set to embark on a five-match T20 series organised at very late notice</p>

<p>‘I was devastated for the players,’ Keightley tells the Mail on Sunday. ‘We were looking forward to the MCG filling up and a really big day. Going into the semi-final, we were confident we could win. But the forecast didn’t look good. </p>

<p>'The players were flat and gutted. Hopefully moving forward they’ll have a reserve day for the semi-finals.’</p>

<p>England ought to see off West Indies, who are four places below them in sixth in the T20 rankings. But, as so often, it is Australia – the one team ranked above England – who remain the yardstick.</p>

<p>‘I think we can beat Australia on any given day,’ says the New South Wales-born Keightley, who during a one-day international in 1998 became the first woman to score a hundred at Lord’s. </p>

<p>But she acknowledges the Australians’ extra investment in the women’s game has allowed them to pull clear, even if the ECB have recently taken steps of their own.</p>

<p>‘The 50-over domestic tournament in Australia and their Women’s Big Bash League really are the best in the world at the moment. To see the ECB investing in the Hundred and the regional competition [the 50-over Rachael Heyho Flint Trophy] will allow more players to come through.’</p>

<p>England's Women's T20 semi-final was abandoned due to heavy rain in Sydney back in March</p>

<p>Keightley says her team have a 'fire in their belly' ahead of their first game since Sydney</p>

<p>There is a sense that English women’s cricket hasn’t quite capitalised on their 50-over World Cup triumph at Lord’s in 2017, when Anya Shrubsole’s six-wicket haul sealed a nerve-jangler against India. But Keightley believes the likes of all-rounder Nat Sciver can do for the game here what Ellyse Perry has done in Australia.</p>

<p>‘A lot of female athletes in Australia look up to Ellyse as a role model,’ she says. ‘Yes, of course England would love to have that player. But we have some fantastic performers. Heather Knight was great at the T20 World Cup, and Katherine Brunt has done so well over a number of years.</p>

<p>‘But Nat Sciver has the potential to be one of the best all-round cricketers in the world and match Ellyse Perry. She’s an excellent athlete and a powerful batter, and she’s improving with the ball. Cricket Australia have marketed their women’s team brilliantly. We can get the attention too.’   </p>
