<p>'I don't remember why we chose these numbers exactly. All I know was 40 years ago we each wrote down numbers and selected a ticket to play. We've been playing ever since,' he said.</p>

<p>The man revealed he spent ten minutes double checking he hadn't made a mistake when he saw the win.           </p>

<p>'I checked the ticket a number of times before checking the website a number of times,' he said.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to make sure it was confirmed and re-confirmed before I told them.</p>

<p>'Once I realised it was true, I had the honour and pleasure of telling my brothers we were division one winners.'</p>

<p>He said it was a great feeling to call his two other brothers and let them know about the winnings.</p>
