<p>Organisers say the event will be legal and only available for people who live within 5km of the Tan.</p>

<p>'Come together, get healthy and talk about getting our freedoms back,' the event says.  </p>

<p>On Friday, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Luke Cornelius unleashed on anybody thinking about attending the march and warned police would be out in full force. </p>

<p>'I feel a bit like a dog returning to eat his own vomit,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am incredibly frustrated. If people were less selfish and a bit more grown up, we wouldn't have to keep doing this.</p>

<p>'Don't take us for fools. We'll have no hesitation in issuing fines.' </p>

<p>Mr Cornelius said as well as the $1,652 fines, people could be charged in court and forced to pay up to $20,000. </p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews also pleaded with people not to take part.</p>

<p>'All you're potentially doing is spreading the virus,' he said on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr Pecora was granted bail on Friday with conditions disallowing him from using social media or contacting other organisers.</p>

<p>Under Stage Four restrictions Melburnians can only leave their homes for exercise if they stay within five kilometres of their house and only for one hour.</p>

<p>They can exercise with one other person.</p>

<p>It comes a week after last Saturday's 'Freedom Day' protests that erupted at the city's Shrine of Remembrance with police tackling demonstrators to the ground and dragging them away in handcuffs.</p>

<p>Thousands turned up to the protest - many without masks - but they were no match for the wall of police officers. </p>

<p>Police arrested 17 people and issued 160 fines to those at last week's protest. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Andrews has announced regional Victoria is on track to ease coronavirus restrictions in a matter of days as cases across the state continue to plummet. </p>

<p>Victoria marked its ninth day in a row of double digit figures on Saturday with just 37 new coronavirus cases - its lowest daily increase since June 26. </p>

<p>Mr Andrews said there are only 58 active coronavirus infections in regional Victoria and no new cases since Friday's update.</p>

<p>He remains hopeful the Stage Three restrictions will be eased by the middle of next week, allowing regional Victoria to be 'essentially open'.   </p>

<p>'Regional Victoria remains on track to be open to take not one but two steps,' Mr Andrews said on Saturday. </p>

<p>'It is very good news for regional Victoria and I hope every single person in metro Melbourne is looking to the numbers in regional Victoria and seeing what can be delivered.</p>

<p>'Regional Victoria is so close, just a few days and they will potentially be able to take not just a single step but two of those steps and be essentially open.'   </p>
