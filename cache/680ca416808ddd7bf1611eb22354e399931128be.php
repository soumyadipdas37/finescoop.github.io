<p>Speaking to Stellar Magazine, the 43-year-old says that turned down the role multiple times as he was not sure that it was 'best for his family'. </p>

<p>'I totally appreciate that the job itself is a spectacular one. But make no mistake, it's not one I was chasing for family reasons. I just wasn't. </p>

<p>Work hard: According to The Daily Telegraph , Alan Jones achieved an audience share of 17.9 percent audience share in his last ratings survey. The paper alleges that Nine management is hoping Ben can can achieve a minimum of 12 percent in his first survey, which is due out soon</p>

<p>'I was concerned about the impact it would have on the family setup. And I suppose I just thought it would be easier not to. I think I said no about six times,' he admitted. </p>

<p>Ben was ultimately swayed by the realisation that his new schedule would allow him to pick up his  son, Freddy, five, from school, and the endorsement of Jodie, 37.</p>

<p>He explained: 'I lean on her heavily. And I gave her a deadline and said, 'Listen, if you change your mind and say no, I will never hold it against you.''</p>

<p>Jodie told Stellar: 'I knew he had to take it, but I probably had a bit of a knot in my stomach trying to process it'.  </p>

<p>Ben recently took his older children, son Freddy, five, and daughter Pearl, three, out of school due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
