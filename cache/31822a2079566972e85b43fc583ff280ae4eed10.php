<p>Tom is also dad to Forrest, 21 months, whom he welcomed in 2018 with his wife Charlotte Riley. </p>

<p>According to reports, the couple have cherry picked the name Forrest because Charlotte has always loved the movie Forrest Gump starring Tom Hanks as the lead role.  </p>

<p>Haircut: Tom headed to the barbers to get a fresh trim </p>

<p>Having mastered a series of roles from the Kray twin brothers in Legend to The Dark Knight Rises' villain Bane, the star is no doubt one of Hollywood's finest actors.   </p>

<p>However, the Venom star stressed there is no job that is 'harder' or 'more important' than being a father to his children.</p>

<p>He previously told The Metro: 'There is no harder and more important job on the planet than parenting.</p>

<p>'You’ve got the military, police, doctors, service personnel — massive respect, huge consequences — but parenting? It’s beyond a job, isn’t it.' </p>

<p>Sweet: Tom is also dad to Forrest, 21 months, whom he welcomed in 2018 with his wife Charlotte Riley (pictured together in 2018)</p>
