<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>China has released the first set of 'selfies' taken by Tianwen-1, the Chinese spacecraft currently travelling towards the Red Planet as part of the country's first Mars exploration.</p>

<p>Images show the probe, consisting of a golden orbiter and a silver lander, dazzling in the darkness of the universe more than two months after leaving Earth.</p>

<p>The photos were captured by a 680-gram camera installed on the outer wall of Tianwen-1 after the probe released the tiny device into space.</p>

<p>China has released the first set of 'selfies' taken by Tianwen-1, the Chinese spacecraft currently travelling towards the Red Planet as part of the country's first Mars exploration</p>

<p>The probe, a golden orbiter and a silver lander, is seen dazzling in the darkness of the universe, a sign that China's most ambitious space mission yet appears to be on track</p>

<p>Tianwen-1, named after a 2,000-year-old Chinese poem that ponders on stars and planets, consists of an orbiter, a lander and a rover and weighs 530 pounds (240kg).</p>

<p>It was blasted into space aboard a Long March-5 on July 23, marking China's first Mars mission as the country seeks to race Russia and the US to become a major space power.</p>

<p>The unmanned space probe is due to arrive on the Red Planet next February after a seven-month, 34-million-mile voyage.</p>

<p>As of Wednesday, it is more than 24million kilometres (15million miles) from Earth en route to the red planet, the National Space Administration said in a post.</p>

<p>The images released by the Chinese authorities on Thursday were the first set of 'selfies' taken by the unmanned space probe.</p>

<p>After receiving commands from Earth, the on-board camera was released by Tianwen-1 into space and took one picture every second with its two wide-angle lenses installed on each side of the device.</p>

<p>The images were then sent back to Tianwen-1 via Wi-Fi and then dispatched to Earth.</p>

<p>An animation produced by Chinese state media Xinhua demonstrates how the camera is released into space by the unmanned space probe before taking the first 'selfies'</p>

<p>China's largest carrier rocket, the Long March 5, blasted off with the Tianwen-1 probe on July 23 from Wenchang Space Launch Centre on the southern island of Hainan</p>

<p>The officials shared the photos on October 1, which marks the start of China's Golden Week, an eight-day holiday celebrating the Chinese National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>

<p>The launch of Tianwen-1 came three days after the UAE launched its own Mars orbiter and a week before NASA's scheduled launch of the Perseverance rover.</p>

<p>The countries took advantage of a period when Earth and Mars are favourably aligned for a short journey.</p>

<p>After watching the US and the Soviet Union lead the way during the Cold War, China has poured billions of dollars into its military-led space programme.</p>

<p>This is not China's first attempt at Mars – in 2011, a Chinese orbiter accompanying a Russian mission was lost when the spacecraft failed to get out of Earth's orbit after launching from Kazakhstan, eventually burning up in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>This is an illustration of what the Tianwen-1 rover could look like when it lands on Mars. The unmanned space probe developed by China is set to reach the Red Planet next February</p>

<p>China's most ambitious space mission includes a Mars orbiter, that will carry the lander and rover until release, a lander, that will parachute down the the surface carrying the rover, and a rover that will study the planet's soil and atmosphere for signs of life after they land</p>

<p>This is not China's first attempt at Mars – in 2011, a Chinese orbiter accompanying a Russian mission was lost when the spacecraft failed to get out of Earth's orbit after launching</p>

<p>But this time, China is going it alone and is fast-tracking by launching an orbiter and rover on the same mission instead of stringing them out.</p>

<p>China's secretive space programme has developed rapidly in recent decades.</p>

<p>Yang Liwei became the first Chinese astronaut in 2003, and last year Chang'e-4 became the first spacecraft from any country to land on the far side of the moon.</p>

<p>Landing on Mars is notoriously difficult, and only the US has successfully landed a spacecraft on Martian soil, doing it eight times since 1976.</p>

<p>China has made huge strides in the past decade and has laid the groundwork to assemble a space station by 2022 and gain a permanent foothold in Earth orbit.</p>

<p>The country has already sent two rovers to the Moon that are operational. With the second, the Yutu-2 rover, China became the first country to make a successful soft landing on the far side of the lunar surface.</p>

<p>The Moon missions gave China experience in operating spacecraft beyond Earth orbit, although Mars is another story.</p>
