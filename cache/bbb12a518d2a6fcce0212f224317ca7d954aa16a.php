<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jason Bateman ensured his youngest daughter claimed her own share of the spotlight as the virtual Emmy Awards got underway in Los Angeles on Sunday night. </p>

<p>The celebrated actor was joined by eight-year old Maple - one of two children with wife Amanda Anka - while attending the annual event from home.</p>

<p>Sitting alongside her father, the youngster looked delighted to be involved as the event launched remotely for the first time in its history. </p>

<p>Getting involved: Jason Bateman ensured his youngest daughter claimed her own share of the spotlight as the virtual Emmy Awards got underway in Los Angeles on Sunday night</p>

<p>Bateman was appearing at the event having been nominated for Lead Actor for his starring role in Ozark.  </p>

<p>However the actor missed out on the night, with the prize going to Succession star Jeremy Strong.  </p>

<p>The actor previously bore the brunt of an inadvertent gaffe being incorrectly named as the winner of the Guest Actor Award instead of its intended recipient, This Is Us star Ron Cephas Jones.</p>

<p>In good company: The celebrated actor was joined by eight-year old Maple - one of two children with wife Amanda Anka - while attending the annual event from home</p>

<p>The error occurred during Saturday's online creative arts Emmys, precursor to Sunday's main ceremony and the culmination of a week of events honoring technical and other achievements.</p>

<p>Saturday's show on FXX, however, was the only one of the creative arts presentations to be televised, making the error more glaring. In a voice-over announcement, Bateman was declared the winner for his guest appearance on HBO's The Outsider, while the screen displayed Jones' name. </p>

<p>The confusion wasn't addressed until after a commercial break, with an on-screen message that read, 'Our apologies, an incorrect winner has been announced. We're fixing it now,' followed by the repeated display of Jones' name but without an announcement.</p>

<p>Awkward:  The actor previously bore the brunt of an inadvertent gaffe being incorrectly named as the winner of the Guest Actor Award instead of its intended recipient, This Is Us star Ron Cephas Jones</p>

<p>Mix up: The error occurred during Saturday's online creative arts Emmys, precursor to Sunday's main ceremony and the culmination of a week of events honoring technical and other achievements</p>

<p>There was no immediate explanation for the mistake.</p>

<p>Jones was good-natured about the mistake when he fielded questions virtually afterward, focused instead on his second Emmy for 'This Is Us' and especially on his daughter, actor-singer Jasmine Cephas Jones.</p>

<p>He expressed delight when learning that the pair made Emmy history as the first father and daughter to win in the same year. Her short-form series acting trophy came earlier this week for Quibi´s '#FreeRayshawn.'</p>

<p>'My heart just explodes when I think about her and watch her and the success that she´s had,' he said.</p>
