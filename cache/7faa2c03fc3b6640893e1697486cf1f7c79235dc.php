<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo cannot make it much clearer for the board - he is frantically trying to sign a striker before the transfer window closes.</p>

<p>'I need the striker as soon as possible,' he told Sky Sport Italia after a friendly win against Novara on Sunday. 'But the market is long. There will be time to be able to work until October 4.' </p>

<p>As the latest Serie A season approaches and with the club under a new leader who holds legendary status at the club, there is pressure to perform and hit the ground running for Pirlo, with his toughest task coming before the season has even begun in finding a strike partner for Cristiano Ronaldo. </p>

<p>Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo's faces a mad dash to sign a striker before the window closes</p>

<p>Pirlo is looking to find a strike partner for Cristiano Ronaldo and is linked with some big names</p>

<p>The club's only other natural No 9 Gonzalo Higuain was released on Thursday, with latest reports suggesting he is on the brink of a move to David Beckham's Inter Miami to join forces with former team-mate Blaise Matuidi in the MLS.  </p>

<p>Whilst Ronaldo appears to not be slowing down with age, Pirlo finds himself light with attacking options as Paulo Dybala, Douglas Costa and Federico Bernardeschi are all more natural sitting behind the striker or out wide.</p>

<p>Some of Europe's elite frontmen are on the radar and, with that in mind, Sportsmail looks at which striker would suit a move to Juventus the best. </p>

<p>Luis Suarez</p>

<p>The Barcelona forward has become one of the big names to be thrown aside by new manager Ronald Koeman. </p>

<p>The Uruguayan is now on the hunt for a move to another top club after Koeman told the striker he was not part of his plans moving forward in a brutal 60-second phone call.</p>

<p>If Suarez can get a deal over the line, with reports suggesting that personal terms appear to be the final hurdle, then he would fit well in the 3-5-2 system that many Italian outlets believe Pirlo will implement going forward. </p>

<p>Luis Suarez is on his way out of Barcelona and would work very well up front with Ronaldo</p>

<p>He is a natural finisher, lacking somewhat in the pace department these days, contrary to his Liverpool days, but he has gained experience that has seen him develop into a more calculated striker. </p>

<p>With pacey and skilful players all around him, Suarez could act as a focal point for the attack as he is effective with his back to goal as well as anywhere inside or around the box.</p>

<p>With Ronaldo, it would work. The pair have slightly different attributes and strengths that would compliment each other rather than be a hindrance to their games. He has a proven track record of goalscoring and winning trophies with Barcelona and would be a fantastic addition to Juventus. </p>

<p>Alvaro Morata</p>

<p>The Spanish striker has cut a frustrated figure of late in the Atletico Madrid camp having played second fiddle to Diego Costa last season. </p>

<p>Pirlo recently tabled a bid for Morata, who he played alongside during their 2014-15 spell in Turin, but the LaLiga side rejected the offer, according to Marca.</p>

<p>It is reported that Morata - whose wife is Italian - is interested in a move back to Juventus and has obviously caught the eye of the new boss, who does seem to be focusing in on a traditional No 9 type, rather than a pacey, tricky forward. He definitely fits that bill.</p>

<p>Alvaro Morata has cut a frustrated figure at Atletico and would be a good signing for Juventus</p>

<p>Morata has many similar traits to Suarez and in a system alongside Ronaldo, it would offer a nice balance to their attack. </p>

<p>He has an instinct for knowing where the goal is and is a threat in the air. Crossing a ball into the box for either Ronaldo or Morata to get on the end of would cause all sorts of problems for defences given both of their aerial prowess.</p>

<p>However, the downside is that Morata is just simply not as good as Suarez. He has played inconsistently over the last few seasons following his torrid time at Chelsea, and it would be more of a gamble that he would perform to the levels that Suarez would be capable of - especially in the short term.</p>

<p>Moise Kean </p>

<p>The Moise Kean conundrum continues to be a strange one. When Everton signed the Italian striker, it appeared that they had sealed a fantastic capture for a real talent on the European scene. However, he has really struggled to get to grips with life in the Premier League.</p>

<p>After one season at Goodison Park, Kean has already been linked with a move back to Juventus after joining the Toffees on a five-year deal. He is said to be very interested in returning to Juve, and a deal could be made at the end of the window, according to Tuttosport.</p>

<p>Moise Kean has endured a torrid time so far at Everton but is said to be interested in a return</p>

<p>The 20-year-old's return would offer a slightly different perspective for Pirlo, as Kean made a name for himself in the Juventus shirt. </p>

<p>He is still a raw talent, but is not the same style of forward as Morata and Suarez. He tries to get in behind defences and when confident, has a trick or two in his bag. But, he could be a frustrating partner for Ronaldo.</p>

<p>It is highly unlikely he would make the starting XI consistently should he return, and would not be viewed as a strong enough addition should he be the only forward Juventus sign. A move for Kean is more of a nod to the future. </p>

<p>Olivier Giroud</p>

<p>The Chelsea striker has been a target for Juventus, as they turned their focus to the Frenchman after they reportedly hit a stumbling block in their pursuit of Suarez. </p>

<p>No formal offer has been made by the club and any potential move is quite far away, with no talks being held as of yet for the Frenchman.</p>

<p>With the Blues summer spending spree, Giroud has seen himself fall down the pecking order at Chelsea with the arrival of Timo Werner. Also, academy graduate Tammy Abraham will be favoured over Giroud due to the number of years he has on. him in terms of age. </p>

<p>Juventus have shown some interest in Olivier Giroud but he looks likely to stay at Chelsea </p>

<p>If the Old Lady were to accelerate their interest and sign the striker, he would make a strong addition to Pirlo's ranks. </p>

<p>He is a very physical striker, an attribute needed to survive in the attritional and abrasive Serie A, and is a very intelligent striker. He dedicates much of his efforts on the pitch to creating space or teeing up others, whilst also being able to score clinical, or the more elaborate goal. </p>

<p>For Ronaldo, Giroud would be a great strike partner as he would bring the best out of him by doing the dirty work in order to make the Portuguese's life easier. Yet again, however, he doesn't quite possess the star quality of Suarez that will not just strike fear into Serie A opponents but their Champions League opponents too - the trophy they are craving more than most having gone without since 1996.</p>
