<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Saracens suffered late Heineken Champions Cup heartbreak as Racing 92 claimed a dramatic 19-15 semi-final win in Paris.</p>

<p>Alex Goode had kicked five penalties as Saracens overturned a 9-6 interval deficit and boost hopes of a fourth Heineken Champions Cup title in five years.</p>

<p>But the champions were undone in the 76th minute when leading 15-12, Virimi Vakatawa charged clear and wing Juan Imhoff accepted Finn Russell's pass to score the game's only try which Maxime Machenaud converted.</p>

<p>Racing 92 have reached the Champions Cup final after a late comeback against Saracens</p>

<p>It marks the end of the Saracens era, with the holders crashing out at the semi-final stage </p>

<p>Juan Imhoff'S try in the 76th minute was the difference in the end, bursting to the try line </p>

<p>Teddy Iribaren (three) and Machenaud had earlier kicked penalties for Racing - losing finalists in 2016 and 2018 - as the 1,000 fans allowed in at the Paris La Defense Arena savoured a famous home victory.</p>

<p>Saracens kept the same side that floored Leinster in the quarter-final, with Goode continuing at fly-half in the place of the suspended Owen Farrell.</p>

<p>Russell and Simon Zebo were part of a dangerous Racing back division whose efficiency was reflected by the fact the French club had managed the most clean breaks in the competition this season.</p>

<p>Racing lost flanker Fabien Sanconnie to a third-minute head injury and the subsequent delay appeared to effect both sides, who struggled for fluency during a scrappy opening.</p>

<p>Imhoff buried Saracens, turning the scores around after being down 15-12 in the dying minutes</p>

<p>Iribaren broke the deadlock with an 11th-minute penalty before Saracens centre Duncan Taylor was forced off with a shoulder injury and replaced by Dominic Morris.</p>

<p>The Vunipolas, Mako and Billy, combined neatly in Saracens' best passage of play and Racing were punished by referee Nigel Owens for not using ruck possession quickly enough.</p>

<p>Goode levelled the scores from in front of the posts and Saracens were beginning to win the battle for field position.</p>

<p>A second Goode penalty gave the visitors the lead on the half-hour mark, but Iribaren immediately replied to tie the scores at 6-6.</p>

<p>Camille Chat's careless knock-on allowed Saracens a prime attacking opportunity, but indiscipline at scrum-time let Racing off the hook and Teddy Thomas' break down the left set up one final first-half chance.</p>

<p>The match was kept close throughout but Racing 92 will be the ones progressing to the final </p>

<p>Racing won a line-out penalty and Iribaren's kick was classed as good, even though there was some confusion whether it had actually flown inside the post.</p>

<p>Parity was soon restored at the start of the second half as Antonie Claasen knocked on deliberately and Goode stroked over his third penalty.</p>

<p>Goode quickly added a fourth goal for a 12-9 lead as an effective kick-and-chase game began to turn the screw on Racing.</p>

<p>Morris forced another turnover with a crunching hit on Zebo and Goode's fifth penalty provided some breathing space as the lead stretched to six points for the first time.</p>

<p>Elliot Daly holds off a charge of Racing 92 players as Saracens build a narrow lead in Paris</p>

<p>Alex Lewington might have put the issue beyond doubt on a breakaway, but he chose to gather rather than hack on and was held up by backtracking Racing defenders.</p>

<p>Saracens mainstay Brad Barritt was forced off inside the final quarter and his departure galvanised Racing, with Machenaud cutting the gap to three points.</p>

<p>Vakatawa was at the forefront of a thrilling home attack and, although Racing were denied on that occasion, the centre ran clear again and Saracens' grip on the Champions Cup was loosened.</p>
