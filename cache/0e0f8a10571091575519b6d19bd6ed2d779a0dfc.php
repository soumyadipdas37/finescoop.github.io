<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British man questioned over the alleged hacking of Pippa Middleton's iCloud account has been sentenced to five years in jail in the US in an unrelated case.</p>

<p>Nathan Francis Wyatt, who was part of a hacking group called The Dark Overlord, was sentenced for helping the group steal information from several companies in the US, including in Missouri, Illinois and Georgia.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old pleaded guilty in federal court in St Louis to conspiring to commit aggravated identity theft and computer fraud. He was also ordered to pay $1.5 million dollars (£1.17m) in restitution.</p>

<p>In 2016, Wyatt was arrested by UK police investigating the hacking of the Duchess of Cambridge's sister, Pippa Middletmaon.</p>

<p>There were reports that pictures of her sister Kate and her children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, were among thousands of images taken.</p>

<p>The father-of-three was released with no further action in relation to that case in September, 2017.</p>

<p>In St Louis, federal prosecutors said The Dark Overlord stole medical records, client files and personal information from the companies, then demanded between $75,000 and $300,000 dollars (£58,000-£234,000) worth of Bitcoin to return the information.</p>

<p>In 2016, Wyatt was arrested by UK police investigating the hacking of the Duchess of Cambridge's sister, Pippa Middleton (pictured)</p>

<p>None of the companies paid the ransom but the conspiracy did cost them because of the intrusion and release of data, federal prosecutor Laura Kathleen Bernstein said.</p>

<p>Wyatt set up a phone account and accounts on Twitter and PayPal that were used to communicate and receive money, she said.</p>

<p>Wyatt apologised during the hearing, held via Zoom, saying he was on medication for mental problems that led him to make bad decisions, The St Louis Post-Dispatch reported.</p>

<p>'I can promise you that I'm out of that world,' he said, voice breaking. 'I don't want to see another computer for the rest of my life.'</p>

<p>The 39-year-old pleaded guilty in federal court in St Louis to conspiring to commit aggravated identity theft and computer fraud</p>

<p>His lawyer, Brocca Morrison, noted Wyatt did not orchestrate the hacks and is the only hacker who has been identified.</p>

<p>Ms Bernstein said Wyatt's actions helped the other hackers remain anonymous and that his phone account was used to send threatening text messages to relatives of victims.</p>

<p>Wyatt was indicted in 2017, but he was not extradited to the US until last year after British lawyers fought to keep him there.</p>

<p>He had served 14 months in a British prison after pleading guilty to 22 charges after he was accused of demanding money from the owner of a hacked computer and using stolen credit cards.</p>
