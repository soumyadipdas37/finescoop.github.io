<p>The two clubs held talks with Arsenal manager Arteta initially prepared to let Holding leave</p>

<p>Their arrivals at the Emirates took Arteta’s pool of natural centre backs to eight plus Kieran Tierney who can also be deployed at the heart of the defence.</p>

<p>However, Holding has taken his chance to impress Arteta who is now weighing up keeping the 24 year-old as part of his squad for the season.</p>

<p>Holding stepped in at the end of last season following Shkodran Mustafi’s hamstring injury to help Arsenal win the FA Cup with a 2-1 win over Chelsea.</p>

<p>Newcastle wanted to borrow Holding and add him to their influx of new faces this summer</p>

<p>He also contributed to another Wembley win when he lined up alongside Luiz and Tierney as Arsenal beat Liverpool on penalties to win the Community Shield last month.</p>

<p>Newcastle’s move for Holding has now been temporarily shelved as they wait to see if Arsenal have a further change of heart.</p>
