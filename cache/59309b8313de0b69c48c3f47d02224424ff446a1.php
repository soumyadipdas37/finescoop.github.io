<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have pushed the boat out with their new zebra-themed third kit which has generated scathing reviews from supporters on social media - despite none other than David Beckham modelling the fresh gear. </p>

<p>First-team players Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and Scott McTominay also model the kit, which club manufacturers adidas say is 'inspired by striped jerseys from the club's history.'</p>

<p>However, following Chelsea's bold take on their third-choice kit on Monday, fans on social media have responded in a similarly mixed manner to the zebra-stripes which cover the shirt, shorts and socks, with one commenting: 'People will use it to cross the road!'</p>

<p>Adidas have emphasised that the 'visually distinctive design... provides a fresh update to tradition, while delivering a vibrant new print.' </p>

<p>United first wore a striped kit over 100 years ago and also wore similar designs in the 1970s and 1980s. </p>

<p>The collar of the new jersey features a '110 years of stripes' sign off, signifying the history of the club's jerseys. </p>

<p>However, fans on social media were not impressed, with one saying: 'Imagine having a zebra crossing for our third kit.'  </p>

<p>Generally, supporters did not seem to take it well, with one claiming it is the 'worst third kit ever in the history of football.' </p>

<p>Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>Topps1765 said: 'Wouldn't put my name on that embarrassment of a third kit, not even if I got it for free' and another tweeted: 'Who the hell signed off the third kit? It's horrendous!' </p>

<p>Yet adidas insist the kit 'demonstrates a continued ambition to push the boundaries of shirt design.' </p>

<p>The kit manufacturers state that they 're-drew, hacked and re-imagined combined elements from various jerseys throughout the club's long history to create a bold new pattern.</p>

<p>'Utilising United’s iconic club colours of red, white and black the kit is an original story with a modern update.' </p>

<p>The kit is available today exclusively at adidas.com/football, adidas stores, and official club stores. Wider release with select retailers will be available from 15th September 2020.</p>
