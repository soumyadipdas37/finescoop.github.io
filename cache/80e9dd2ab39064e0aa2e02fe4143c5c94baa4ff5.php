<p>The news that the former One Direction star, 27, and his partner Maya, 20, had become betrothed broke last week and during an appearance on Good Morning America. </p>

<p>Engaged: Liam Payne has spoken about his engagement for the first time saying that he and his new fiancée Maya Henry are blissfully "happy" </p>

<p>After being congratulated on his news, he said: 'We’re just really happy. I mean, in the last week, I’ve just had a birthday, my son has gone to school for the first time today, so it seems like a lot of firsts for me, really, actually, which is great.'</p>

<p>Liam shares three-year-old son Bear with his former partner Cheryl, whom he split from in July 2018.</p>

<p>It was confirmed that the For You hitmaker had popped the question to Maya in August after the brunette beauty was spotted wearing a diamond ring on her left hand after having dinner with Liam at Novikov Restaurant &amp; Bar in London.</p>

<p>The couple were first spotted together back in August 2018, but didn't make their romance Instagram office until September 2019.</p>

<p>Liam has previously described Maya - who he initially met when she was a fan of One Direction - as his "best friend".</p>

<p>He said: 'I've found someone who's genuinely my best friend. She's just so relaxed about everything and someone who's completely got your back with everything is just the wildest thing. </p>

<p>'I don't think I've ever really experienced that before in someone so it's quite a wonder to watch actually.'</p>

<p>The singer has also insisted that Maya had helped him cope with his fame and had given him the confidence to be himself in public and simply relax and not worry about any attention he might receive.</p>

<p>He said: 'The difference is with [Maya], she’s so relaxed that it helps me relax in a situation, rather than being somewhere and talk about who is watching and what’s going on.</p>

<p>'People are going to watch whatever. What am I supposed to do? I can’t do anything about it now. It’s too late for that.' </p>
