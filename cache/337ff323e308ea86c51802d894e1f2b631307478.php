<p>The 26-year-old told MailOnline she's 'relieved' after having the liposuction done earlier this month, following years of feeling 'self-conscious' about her legs.</p>

<p>Shaughna, who rose to fame on winter Love Island in January, said she's been offered countless 'gifted' procedures since being on the series but paid for her recent surgery out of her own pocket.</p>

<p>'It's a relief': Love Island star Shaughna Phillips underwent surgery to have fat removed from her calves, after being diagnosed with a condition when she came out the villa </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, she said: 'I was diagnosed with a condition when I came out the villa, purely through me doing some research.</p>

<p>'The condition is called lipoedema – it can happen to any part of your body but for me it was my calves. It's fat cells that double and reproduce but exercise doesn't break them down, which is the worst thing in the world.</p>

<p>'They're not quite sure what causes it but mine is definitely hereditary on my dad's side, so my aunt and my Nan definitely suffered with it.</p>

<p>'Just having a name for it made me feel such relief. It's been such a self-conscious thing for me since I was 14.</p>

<p>'Self-conscious': The 26-year-old told MailOnline she's 'relieved' after having the liposuction done earlier this month, following years of feeling 'self-conscious' about her legs </p>

<p>'I am bandaged up and sore': The 26-year-old told MailOnline she's 'relieved' after having the liposuction done earlier this month, following years of feeling 'self-conscious' about her legs </p>

<p>'I found a surgeon that carried out liposuction on my calves, so I am recovering at home now.</p>

<p>'I am bandaged up and a little bit sore but I'm trying to keep walking and be active.'</p>

<p>Lipoedema is a chronic condition typically affecting the legs and thighs.</p>

<p>The build up of fat is not caused through obesity, and diet and exercise have little impact on the condition.</p>

<p>Research suggests it is caused by hormonal changes such as those coming at pregnancy or puberty. </p>

<p>It is typically treated through liposuction. </p>

<p>Shaughna aims to be transparent with her 1.5million Instagram followers and has not held back in sharing the reality of going under the knife.</p>

<p>Since having the liposuction done, Shaughna has posted a number of images, which highlight the downsides of recovery, including soreness, swelling and bleeding.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I really hate that women get judged for having plastic surgery, especially influencers.</p>

<p>'I paid for all of my surgery; I haven't done any ad or collaboration. Anything I put up now is the wholehearted truth – I didn't want to sugarcoat anything for anyone that might be thinking about getting surgery.</p>

<p>'I've been offered gifted surgery since I came out the villa and you kind of think – I'm in the position now where I can pay for it.</p>

<p>'I don't want to advertise surgery to women that could get themselves in debt for something I got for free.</p>

<p>'It is completely different to changing your hair colour. It sounds a bit over the top but surgery can be life or death.' </p>

<p>Harsh reality: The Love Island star aims to be transparent with her 1.5million Instagram followers and has not held back in sharing the reality of going under the knife </p>

<p>Shaughna admits she's regularly accused by fans of having more procedures done to her face</p>

<p>But the reality star is adamant that aside from her recent treatment on her legs – and lip fillers, which she's been having done since 2016, that she's all natural.</p>

<p>She said: 'I saw a story saying how much work I've had done in the first two weeks since leaving the villa and genuinely, I hadn't washed my hair or shaved my legs. When I was able to fit all this surgery in, I don't know.</p>

<p>'I did see a lot of comments about how much work I had – I felt like saying, if I had this work, I would be the first person to scream it from the rooftops. I have never denied a single procedure.</p>

<p>'I have been having my lips done since 2016. No one has ever paid for it for me. I don't want young girls who are 16 or 17 wanting things done from looking at me. The girl that does my lips has been doing them since 2016.'</p>

<p>'I have never denied a procedure': Shaughna admits she's regularly accused of having more procedures done to her face, but says other than her calves and lip fillers, she's all natural</p>

<p>The Love Island star has sworn off dating after still being 'scarred' from her time in the villa, that saw her get dumped by Callum Jones during the big Casa Amor twist.</p>

<p>She said: 'To be completely honest, I haven't really wanted to date.</p>

<p>'With the journey I had on Love Island, I just wanted a breather. I wanted a break from all of that. I'm really happy being on my own at the moment.</p>

<p>'I haven't watched Casa Amor back because I'm still scarred!' </p>

<p>But her tribulations when it comes to dating will help Shaughna with her newest challenge, as she joins TOWIE's Pete Wicks in giving fans advice with their romantic dilemmas as part of Mike's Hard Seltzer's dating hotline. </p>

<p>New challenge: Shaughna joins TOWIE's Pete Wicks in giving fans advice with their romantic dilemmas as part of Mike's Hard Seltzer's dating hotline </p>

<p>She said: 'It's almost like a big group therapy session.</p>

<p>'Pete and I are both really good at giving advice, it's just taking it that we struggle with. We do tend to agree when we are giving out advice.</p>

<p>'I met Pete about two years ago at a mixer for Celebs Go Dating, he was one of the guys I were talking to there so I've come full circle.'</p>

<p>Shaughna was speaking on behalf of Mike's Hard Seltzer, who has launched a dating advice hotline to help Brits stop overthinking their love life. Mike's Love Advice Hotline will be open to the public via WhatsApp on 25th September from 3-6pm, and Pete Wicks and Shaughna Phillips will be on hand to answer any questions </p>
