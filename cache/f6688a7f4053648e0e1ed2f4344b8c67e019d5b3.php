<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United and Porto's valuations of defender Alex Telles differ by £6million, according to reports.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands the Brazilian left-back is expected to be the next new player through the door at Old Trafford ahead of Monday's deadline.</p>

<p>But The Telegraph are reporting that the two clubs have yet to agree a fee, with the Portuguese side demanding £18m for the 27-year-old's signature.</p>

<p>However, the report adds that figure is substantially more than United are willing to pay for a player who can talk to foreign suitors come January and the next transfer window.</p>

<p>The same outlet claims United value Telles at about £12m and are hoping Telles' determination to move to the club will encourage United's Portuguese counterparts to lower the fee they are currently holding out for.</p>

<p>However, for the moment it appears that negotiations are not proving straightforward in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's bid to strengthen his defence ahead of the transfer window slamming shut on October 5.</p>

<p>The same can be said for United's pursuit of Jadon Sancho, with the Premier League side denying reports that they have made a £91.2m offer for the Borussia Dortmund star – £73m plus £18.2m in add-ons – which has been rejected.</p>

<p>But negotiations are proving to be tougher than expected for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's club</p>

<p>Porto are demanding £18m for Telles, but United are unwilling to pay more than £12m for him</p>

<p>Sancho remains United's No 1 target but Sportsmail understands they have been worried about losing face and the backlash from fans if a formal bid is turned down.</p>

<p>They are believed to have held discussions with intermediaries on Tuesday and are still refusing to meet Dortmund's demand for £108m.</p>

<p>United must now decide whether to pursue their interest with less than a week left of the window or call a halt to the long-running saga and look at other options.</p>

<p>Should they opt for the latter, Sportsmail understands United could move for Barcelona's Ousmane Dembele, with club sources confirming the 23-year-old Frenchman has been discussed, although any move is likely to be on loan.</p>

<p>United are finding it tough on the Jadon Sancho saga too and have denied making a £91m bid</p>

<p>Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele is an option if they fail to land Sancho this summer</p>
