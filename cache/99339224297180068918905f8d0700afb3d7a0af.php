<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A host of Australian swimwear designers, including Cotton On, have released crinkle-patterned bikinis and one pieces that rival a popular designer brand beloved by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Kim Kardashian.</p>

<p>Hunza G, a swimwear connoisseur in London, is well known in the fashion industry and on Instagram for its sell-out $255 Domino suit featuring two rings that attach the bodice to the straps.</p>

<p>'Our Domino swim is a firm classic, and like all Hunza G swims, provides enough support and shape for most. There are small tortoiseshell details to lift this style, achieving a smart wearable look,' the website read.</p>

<p>Australian stockists like Beach Luxe, Girls with Gems and It's Now Cool are constantly selling out of the summer swim, so other brands Down Under have created the look for less - so no one misses out (Cotton On left and Hunza G right)</p>

<p>In Cotton On Body's recent drop of swimwear it launched the $34.99 Ring Front Scoop One Piece in a powder blue and black shade that has the same ring detail as Hunza G's Domino.</p>

<p>An honest review on the website read: 'I love the fabric and style of this swimsuit. The colour is beautiful and the pattern is subtle but really pretty. I got the size small however the straps were a little bit long, so I recommend going down a size'. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Bond-Eye Swim sells neon shades in its Bound range that look remarkably similar to the $245 Xandra and $254 Jean Bikini created by Hunza G, but for just $160 a pair. </p>

<p>The colours - which range from a watermelon pink to lime green - feature the same crinkle pattern as the designer threads.</p>

<p>Both brands have the same 'one size fits all' policy because of their stretchy fabric, which would fit an Australian size six to 12 or 14.</p>

<p>Australian favourite TJ Swim has recently launched a range of crinkle patterned bikinis and one pieces to rival the Hunza G favourites, also at the cheaper price of $129.99.</p>

<p>They sold out of the Jasmine one piece after the launch and have promised customers a restock, proving that the look will be hugely popular in the southern hemisphere this summer.</p>

<p>'I am obsessed with this suit. It flatters your womanly curves so well,' one customer wrote on Instagram. </p>
