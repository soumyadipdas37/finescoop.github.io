<p>'The original date was May 7, and we were told we'd have to have 20 people max, which wasn't enough for the bridal parties alone, much less staff, family and guests,' Beckham told the outlet. </p>

<p>He added: 'We made the decision to postpone the wedding to a date we believed for sure would be free and clear of COVID. As we've all learned, it's still not over so we had to cut down the vast majority of the guests that we already invited.'</p>

<p>Then, a 'week or so before the wedding' they discovered they could invite 'most' of their guests again.  </p>

<p>'I went there a lot,' Beckham told People. 'One day I saw her, didn't know her, wanted to know her, and walked up to introduce myself. I had never done that in my life. We talked ... I was awkward, but I got her name and she got mine. Next time, we talked a little more and the rest is history.' </p>

<p>As the sparks continue to fly years later, he gushed 'there's no one in the world I'd rather have on my team when the going gets tough.'</p>

<p>'It also goes without saying she's one of the most virtuous, beautiful, brilliant people I've ever met and will ever meet in my life,' he said.  </p>

<p>Here comes the bride: The venue was in Brentwood, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville</p>

<p>Cheers! Bridesmaids wore black gowns, as they stood by the bride in her sparkly white wedding dress </p>

<p>All in the details: Olive branches, white roses and other minimal decorations provided a stunning backdrop for the pair's nuptials </p>
