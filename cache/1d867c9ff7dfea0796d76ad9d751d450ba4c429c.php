<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Artists, nail technicians and photographers have taken to social media to share some of the most outrageous interactions they have had with potential clients.</p>

<p>People from across the world shared the painfully awkward exchanges with customers asking for a lot more than a seller was willing to give, with Bored Panda gathering together some of the most toe-curling into  an online gallery.</p>

<p>In one instance, a nail technician was told she 'isn't even good' after she told a woman who asked for two of her nails covered in crystals that she would not reduce her prices for her. </p>

<p>Another photographer was left flabbergasted when someone approached them to pay to take photographs at a school Christmas party. </p>

<p>One artist was stunned by the way an influencer spoke to them after asking a pencil drawing for free. It was one of dozens of examples shared by business owners on Bored Panda</p>

<p>A company was sorely mistaken when they assumed an artist would paint their logo onto the wall in their office for free, claiming they thought they 'did it for the art' as opposed to for payment</p>

<p>Someone claiming to be going to model Heidi Klum's Halloween party thought they would get their money's worth by putting a call out on Facebook to see if anyone would do their makeup for free to 'add to their portfolio'</p>

<p>After exchanging pleasantries, this friendship soon took a nose dive when the artist said they would not create some graphics for someone for free</p>
