<p>Candid: Jags and Habiba kissed after he opened up about his mum Suki's lies, admitting it's left him torn between his family</p>

<p>Speaking to MailOnline at the soap's virtual launch, Jon explained that like many other soaps they've used clever camera methods to hide the two metre distance between cast members.  </p>

<p>But he also revealed that they've used perspex screens between stars to continue filming passionate kiss scenes, and have even used some of the cast's real-life partners as body doubles.</p>

<p>He said: 'When we came back we had to devise methods where we could cheat the distance, it's very odd shooting like this, never before in TV history have we made drama in this way, certainly we were forced to work with this 2 metre rule.'</p>

<p>EastEnders continues on Tuesday, September 8 at 7:30pm on BBC One. </p>
