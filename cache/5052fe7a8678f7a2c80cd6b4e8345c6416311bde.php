<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disturbing footage has showed Canberra Raiders centre Curtis Scott writhing on the ground in severe pain after being pepper sprayed and tasered by police.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old had been charged with seven offences - two of assaulting a police officer and one of resisting arrest - after officers found him asleep under a tree following Australia Day celebrations on January 27.</p>

<p>All but two charges though have been dropped as confronting body cam footage emerged showing Scott crying out in agony from the heavy-handed policing.</p>

<p>The vision played in court on Thursday showed Scott being told by an officer 'it's not that bad' after he was pepper-sprayed in the face, 7News reported. </p>

<p>Scott's lawyer argued the decision to taser the NRL star was disproportionate considering his client had only raised his voice and was following the police order not to resist arrest.  </p>

<p>The rugby league player can be heard in the footage saying repeatedly he had 'done nothing wrong'.</p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Giles said the vision was so difficult to watch the footage she did not want to see it a third time and criticised police for claiming they acted appropriately in handcuffing an unconscious man.</p>

<p>Magistrate Giles said that argument was 'a very long and frightening bow'. </p>

<p>Scott's lawyer Sam Macedone said Scott had feared he may have jeopardised his future in the NRL following the arrest and had lost a Nike sponsorship deal. </p>

<p>More to come </p>
