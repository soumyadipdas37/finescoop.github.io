<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Members of the honours committee are considering whether to eliminate the word 'Empire' from the OBE and MBE awards. </p>

<p>It comes after the Black Lives Matter movement brought the titles' links to slavery to the forefront. </p>

<p>The Order of the British Empire recognises contributions to the UK across the arts and sciences, charity, public service and the military.</p>

<p>It is split into a number of different ranks - the most senior of which makes people a knight or a dame.</p>

<p>A senior member of the Commons honours committee said the recent protests had reignited debate about the Empire's association with brutality and slavery.</p>

<p>'This has been a live issue for some time but there has been heightened discussion about it among members of the committee since the protests,' a source told The Times newspaper.</p>

<p>'Some members favour the removal of the word "empire" from the existing honours, but others would but others would prefer the introduction of a new medal that better reflects a more diverse 21st-century Britain.'</p>

<p>'Benjamin Zephaniah OBE – no way, Mr Blair, no way Mrs Queen. I am profoundly anti-empire.' </p>

<p>Celebrities who have shunned the offer of being made an OBE or MBE include Danny Boyle, Jon Snow and Stephen Hawking.</p>
