<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool 'have agreed a £1.8million deal for Brazilian goalkeeper Marcelo Pitaluga' as the Premier League champions make their second signing of the summer.</p>

<p>The Anfield club's scouts have reportedly been monitoring the 17-year-old Fluminense stopper for several months and have made a breakthrough in negotiations.</p>

<p>Brazilian news outlet Globo Esporte say Liverpool had their original offer rejected but returned with a second bid of £930,000 for Pitaluga plus a further £930,000 if he achieves various performance-related add-ons.</p>

<p>The teenager (left) is highly rated and is said to have been scouted for the last several months</p>

<p>Fluminense were reluctant to sell Pitaluga but Liverpool's offer has apparently too good to refuse.</p>

<p>Globo Esporte say Pitaluga will sign a three-year contract with the option for a further two years.</p>

<p>The deal was pushed through more easily than usual with South American imports because the Brazilian holds a German passport. This means the 17-year-old doesn't have to wait until his next birthday to move to Europe.</p>

<p>The financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was another factor in the Brazilian club's need to sell the youngster after president Mario Bittencourt spoke about the need to raise funds through player sales.</p>

<p>Reports in Brazil detail that he would sign a three-year contract with Liverpool this summer</p>

<p>Pitaluga was also fourth in the club's goalkeeper pecking order though Liverpool will obviously see him as one for the future.</p>

<p>He posted an Instagram snap alongside Reds keeper Alisson Becker back in February and has previously visited England with Brazil's youth sides.</p>

<p>Liverpool have been quiet in the transfer market ahead of the new season, with the Greek international defender Kostas Tsimikas coming in for £12million. </p>

<p>They begin their Premier League title defence against Leeds United on Saturday. </p>
