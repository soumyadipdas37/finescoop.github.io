<p>'It's weird when your children go away to college,' Reese previously told host Ellen DeGeneres during a segment on her talk show. </p>

<p>'It's hard. I never imagined how it felt for my mom. I might have gone into [Ava's] empty room, laid down on her bed and cried when she went to college.'</p>

<p>While Ava hits the books, Reese's son Deacon is currently pursuing a career in music.</p>

<p>Family matters: Reese is now married to talent agent Jim Toth, and the couple share son Tennessee together </p>

<p>'I just say if you're not embarrassing your children, you're not spending enough time with them,' she recently told guest host Kerry Washington on Jimmy Kimmel Live.</p>

<p>'That's basically my role. It's our job, as parents, to really ramp up the embarrassment.'</p>
