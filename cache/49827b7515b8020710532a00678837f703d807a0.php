<p>Antonio Conte won the Premier League with Kante, who is open to a move, at Chelsea and the Inter Milan boss believes the World Cup winner is the final piece of the jigsaw for his squad.</p>

<p>But according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter must sell some players to meet Chelsea's £46million asking price.</p>

<p>Inter Milan are desperate to sign Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante this summer, reports say</p>

<p>Chelsea have already rejected offers from Inter for Kante involving Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic.</p>

<p>The Italians want Kante, 28, to anchor their midfield this season and have made the Frenchman their primary target.</p>

<p>Chelsea, however, would rather sell Jorginho ahead of Kante and have no interest in either Eriksen or Brozovic.</p>

<p>Inter have a limited budget and will have to be creative in their offers as they look to streamline a vast squad.</p>

<p>Antonio Conte won the Premier League with Kante, who is open to a move, at Chelsea</p>

<p>Former Tottenham midfielder Eriksen has failed to have the desired impact since his £18m move last January and Inter are willing to offload him even though the Dane insisted this week he was happy in Italy.</p>

<p>Chelsea are well stocked in midfield themselves though would like to add a younger holding player with West Ham's Declan Rice and Lille's Boubakary Soumare among those fancied by Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>Jorginho, 28, is considered more expendable and, after their outlay this summer, Lampard recognises the club have to consider ways of balancing the books.</p>

<p>Inter Milan's approach for Kante included a swap deal with former Spurs star Christian Eriksen</p>
