<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victorian police snatched a sign reading 'free Melbourne' from two friends out for a walk, saying protesting was banned during lockdown. </p>

<p>Officers demanded the pair throw the sign away despite complying with all the lockdown rules.</p>

<p>Both men were wearing gloves and masks, walking in the allowed group of two, and said they were within 5km of their homes this weekend.</p>

<p>However, the female police officer told them the sign was in itself illegal and they would be breaking the law if they didn't bin it. </p>

<p>'You don't need to exercise with that sign, because that to me is indicating that you're about to protest and that's illegal,' she said in the video.</p>

<p>'So I'm going to ask you to throw the sign away.'</p>

<p>Both men were wearing gloves and masks, walking in the allowed group of two, and said they were within 5km of their homes this weekend</p>

<p>The pair questioned whether it was really illegal for them to simply hold a sign while going for their walk.</p>

<p>'Yes, because obviously it's a sign of protest and it's illegal,' the officer replied.</p>

<p>The pair argued it wasn't illegal to protest, only to gather which they were not doing as there was only two of them.</p>

<p>'I'm not going to argue the point, you either put [the sign] in the bin or I will,' the policewoman insisted.</p>

<p>'At this point in time you don't have the right to protest... not in this current health pandemic.'</p>

<p>Another video showed police letting the men leave without a fine once they had confiscated the sign. </p>

<p>A friend of the pair posted the footage on social media. </p>

<p>'They were not even "protesting" - halfway through their permitted exercise they decided to scribble it on a piece of cardboard, almost facetiously,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'There are no photos because the police officers forcibly removed the sign from their hands and threw it in the bin.'</p>

<p>The female police officer (right) told them the sign was in itself illegal and they would be breaking the law if they didn't bin it</p>

<p>Melburnians are allowed to exercise in groups of two within 5km of their homes for two hours a day. The 9pm curfew was lifted on Monday.</p>

<p>Protest organisers have been charged with incitement, but they were allegedly advocating for mass demonstrations. </p>

<p>Victoria Police were contacted for comment.</p>
