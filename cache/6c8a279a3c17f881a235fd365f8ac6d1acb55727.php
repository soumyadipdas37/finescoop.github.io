<p>Back in black: Bella Hadid left little to the imagination Sunday in a sexy sheer black ensemble, as she presented the inaugural Tricon Award to Lady Gaga during the MTV Video Music Awards on Sunday</p>

<p>The 23-year-old donned a see-through off-the-shoulder long-sleeve top, layered with an almost-as-sheer black bra.</p>

<p>She complemented the top with some high-waisted black slacks and a pair of black strappy stilettos with jeweled details.</p>

<p>Hadid put on a sleek black cat-eye with a flawless glam look, framed by gold hoop earrings and black flat-ironed wisps, dangling from a '90s chic updo. </p>

<p>She previously took to Instagram with an impromptu photo shoot, posing in her stunning ensemble.  </p>

<p>The brunette beauty filmed her brief segment in front of a green screen, as this year's awards show took precautions against COVID-19, ditching the usual live audience format.</p>

<p>The 2020 VMAs were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.</p>

<p>This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines. </p>

<p>MTV explained its plans for the show to '[span] all five boroughs' of New York, to 'pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.'</p>

<p>Hadid's appearance came after her ex The Weeknd (whose real name is Abel Tesfaye), 30, opened the show with a performance of Blinding Lights from Hudson Yards in Manhattan.</p>

<p>The Starboy artist reunited with Hadid last week in New York City, where they filmed their appearances from a studio.</p>

<p>A source told DailyMail.com that the exes appeared to be 'on good terms': 'They played it cool and crossed paths with each other, same place, same time.' </p>

<p>Hadid and Tesfaye were first romantically linked back in early 2015, before taking another break from their on-again, off-again relationship last August. </p>
