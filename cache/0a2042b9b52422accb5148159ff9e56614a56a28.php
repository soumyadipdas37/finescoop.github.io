<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police are investigating if a five-year-old Sydney boy was beaten by his mother's boyfriend over two hellish months resulting in the worst injuries a doctor has ever seen. </p>

<p>The pre-schooler was rushed to hospital on Friday evening after police allegedly found the boy bruised from 'head to toe', suffering brain damage and splinters throughout his body. </p>

<p>The alleged abuse was exposed after a neighbour rang police, worried about terrifying screams coming from the Cabramatta home that night.</p>

<p>But court documents obtained exclusively by Daily Mail Australia reveal detectives are probing whether the boy was abused in the two months earlier, since the couple moved into their red-brick home. </p>

<p>The 20-year-old man accused of beating the five-year-old 'within an inch of his life' appeared calm during a brief appearance in front of a magistrate on Tuesday</p>

<p>A toy scooter, bike and Thomas the Tank Engine rolling tray were heaped out the front of the Cabramatta home this week along with a carton of soft drink and an old mattress</p>

<p>Piles of water bottles, Red Bull and coconut drink were piled up in the home's front yard this week</p>

<p>A police charge sheet tendered in court said the man is accused of 'intentionally wounding' the child between 'the 1st day of July 2020 and the 28th day of August 2020.'</p>

<p>A senior source with knowledge of the police investigation said the boy's injuries will be investigated bruise-by-bruise to see if he was beaten 'just on the Friday night or earlier', in the previous nine weeks. </p>

<p>The source said it all hinges on evidence from doctors. </p>

<p>'These types of investigations rely heavily on medical evidence and that's quite time consuming,' the senior source said. </p>

<p>The boy was rushed to hospital last week and placed on life support. He remained in a critical but stable condition on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The boy's accused attacker appeared in front of a magistrate via video link from Silverwater's Metropolitan Remand Centre on Tuesday, dressed in prison greens.</p>

<p>The accused appeared calm, his hair hanging over his eyes, and simply told the magistrate 'that's correct' when asked if he wanted to get himself a private lawyer.</p>

<p>Magistrate David Degnan told him his case 'will be ultimately dealt with in a higher jurisdiction' than the local court. </p>

<p>Children's shoes, a discarded lunch box and a carton of soft drink were left on the front porch of the mother's red brick home where the crime is alleged to have occurred</p>

<p>The shocking alleged abuse the boy suffered sparked a rare disclosure of a child's horrific injuries by a surgeon at Westmead Children's Hospital.</p>

<p>Westmead Children's Hospital surgeon Dr Adam Fowler tweeted that the boy's injuries made him 'physically sob whilst examining'</p>

<p>Dr Adam Fowler tweeted on Saturday: 'One admission overnight. The worst case of suspected child beating I've ever seen in my professional career.</p>

<p>'One that made me physically sob whilst examining. </p>

<p>'I can't even right now.' </p>

<p>Dr Fowler has since deleted his tweets. </p>

<p>The accused man did not apply for bail on Tuesday and bail was formally refused. He will face court again in eight weeks' time.</p>

<p>The boy's mother is due to face court next week. She has been charged with 'not providing for a child causing danger of a serious injury'. </p>

<p>A court was previously told police had 'very disturbing' images of the boy's alleged injuries, with a magistrate revealing the alleged beating had begun as 'smacking' for disciplinary reasons.</p>

<p>Outside the 'house of horrors': Neighbour Visal Pom (above), who lives out the back, said the secretive mother kept the blinds completely closed no matter the time of day </p>

<p>Strangers come and go, CCTV cameras ring the red brick rental home and without fail, the blinds are always pulled down. </p>

<p>This is the Sydney 'house of horrors' where a boy, five, was allegedly beaten within an inch of his life with a metal pole and wooden stick by his mother's new lover.</p>

<p>The Cabramatta pre-schooler was rushed to hospital on Friday night suffering injuries a devastated doctor candidly described as the 'worst' he's ever seen. </p>

<p>As the child fights for life, neighbours shed light on the boy's intensely private arrested mother, 31, and her boyfriend, 20 - who moved in just weeks ago.</p>

<p>'The blind is always closed, always closed, never see them open at all,' said Mother-of-three Visal Pom, who lives with her family in a small home at the back. </p>

<p>'Only the first time they moved in (did they have the blinds open) as it was the first new home for them. But after that, always closed.</p>

<p>The home where the mother, her son and boyfriend lived was ringed by closed circuit television cameras but neighbours said it was unclear whether they used them</p>

<p>Another neighbour, Kosen Kim, reported seeing different men visiting the house of the apparently unemployed couple each day. </p>

<p>A heartbroken Ms Kim, who said she wished she could have done more, said: 'All different people come ... the men always change. </p>

<p>'Every day I see different (people), not the same person'. </p>

<p>Neighbours said the only child - the son of another man - seemed happy while lolling about the yard with his toys about twice a week.  </p>

<p>A bike, scooter and Thomas the Tank Engine tray sat idly this week in the front yard this week, alongside piles of rubbish, plastic bags, an old mattress and a discarded pillow.</p>

<p>A Thomas the Tank Engine toy and cardboard box filled with junk sit idly out the front of the 'house of horrors' where Friday night's tragic events allegedly occurred</p>

<p>Police gather outside the home the night after the alleged 'smacking' incident escalated into a suspected case of child abuse</p>

<p>Only a couple of neighbours heard the commotion on Friday night, which led one to call the police about 9.50pm.</p>

<p>Another neighbour said the screaming prompted him to turn up the volume of a movie he was watching - thinking it was just another set of locals having their usual row.  </p>

<p>A New South Wales Police Force spokeswoman said the boy was in a critical but stable condition on Tuesday.</p>
