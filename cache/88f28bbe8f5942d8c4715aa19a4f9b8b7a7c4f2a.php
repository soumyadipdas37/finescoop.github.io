<p>Ferandinho has been confirmed as the new Manchester City club captain by Pep Guardiola</p>

<p>The City boss revealed the decision was made collectively by players and the backroom staff</p>

<p>The midfielder was often the on-pitch captain last season as Silva saw less playing time and Guardiola has no doubt of his ability to step into the role full-time.</p>

<p>'He will be good, as he always has done since I met him,' said the Man City manager. </p>

<p>'Sometimes I have captains, it doesn't matter with the armband, being the first captain, he is always a guy who leads in the bad moments.' </p>

<p>'We decided in the locker room - the players, the backroom staff - we decided that Fernandinho is captain and I am more than delighted with that.' </p>

<p>Fernandinho, who joined the club from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, was one of three 'assistant' captains last season along with Kevin De Bruyne and Sergio Aguero. </p>

<p>The Brazilian takes over the armband from David Silva who left the club in the summer</p>

<p>The usually deep-lying midfielder played much of last season as a defender after City's trouble with injuries.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether he will revert to his usual midfield position this season as Guardiola continues his search for a new central defender.</p>

<p>The north-west club open their 2020-21 campaign against Wolves on Monday night.</p>
