<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>iOS 14 displays a small orange dot in the corner of an iPhone's display to let users know that their microphone or camera is activated. </p>

<p>The new version of Apple's operating system, released this week, acts as a prompt for users that at least one of their apps is currently listening or watching in. </p>

<p>The small but noticeable dot appears at the top right of the iPhone or iPad's display, just above the signal bars. </p>

<p>This is not much to worry about when users are enjoying a video call over apps like Zoom and Facebook Messenger, which need camera and audio to work.</p>

<p>However, the dots will be crucial indicators that other apps are listening in when they shouldn't be. </p>

<p>The orange dot, circled in red by MailOnline, appears at the top of your screen whenever an app is using your microphone or camera</p>

<p>The helpful dot is part of Apple's increasing focus on privacy as part of the new iOS.  </p>

<p>'Privacy is a fundamental human right and at the core of everything we do, Apple says on its website. </p>

<p>'That’s why with iOS 14, we’re giving you more control over the data you share and more transparency into how it’s used. </p>

<p>'An indicator appears at the top of your screen whenever an app is using your microphone or camera.'</p>

<p>iPhone users can also go to their phone's Control Center to seen if an app has used the microphone or camera recently. </p>

<p>Users can deny apps access to their camera and microphone if they're constant offenders – or delete the apps altogether. </p>

<p>For iPadOS 14 – the new operating system for Apple tablets – the tiny dot is orange when the microphone is in use and green when the camera is in use. </p>

<p>After months of anticipation, Apple released its new iOS 14 Wednesday, September 16 - although there was no sign of the new iPhone 12 as expected</p>

<p>Another privacy-focused update that comes with iOS 14 is the ability to share only an approximate location with apps, rather than an exact location.</p>

<p>This suits iPhone users who are wary about revealing to certain apps exactly where they live, for example.</p>

<p>To enable this, users need to go to Settings, Privacy and Location Services and then select the app from the list. </p>

<p>Toggling on Precise Location to green will let the app know exactly where the user is, while turning it off will let apps only determine an approximate location. </p>

<p>iOS 14 was released on September 16, following Apple's ‘Time Flies’ event, which also unveiled the new Apple Watch Series 6, iPad Air and the 8th Generation iPad.</p>

<p>The software is available on iPhone 6s and above, giving users access to a redesigned home screen, widget gallery and App clips, along with a new Siri interface.</p>

<p>The firm is also launching its iPadOS 14 that updates Apple Pencil, allowing it to convert handwriting to typed lettering and recognizes Chinese characters in addition to the standard English alphabet.</p>

<p>Many Apple fans were disappointed that the company did not reveal the upcoming iPhone 12 this week as expected. </p>

<p>Apple CFO Luca Maestri has already confirmed that the iPhone 12 would come out a few weeks later than usual. Things </p>

<p>The company has already confirmed that new iPhones won't be available until next month, fuelling speculation it will hold another event in a few weeks. </p>

<p>Respected leaker Jon Prosser revealed schematics of a drastically reduced camera 'notch' on the front, expected for the iPhone 12</p>

<p>A pair of leaked schematics suggest that Apple's upcoming iPhone 12 will fall just short of eliminating a camera 'notch' on the phone's display.</p>

<p>The pictures, posted on Twitter by frequent phone leaker Jon Prosser, show what appear to be official Apple schematics for its next flagship iPhone - specifically a drastically reduced 'notch' that stores the device's front-facing camera components.</p>

<p>According to the schematics the microphone will be moved to the top of the device's display in order to compress the size of the camera notch.</p>

<p>Citing ‘people familiar with the plans,’ the report notes that Apple is set to release four new smartphones this year, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>The devices will come in three different sizes - one will be 5.4 inches, two at 6.1 inches and another model is 6.7 inches, according to the WSJ. </p>

<p>Some, if not all, of the new handsets will support 5G. </p>

<p>Apple’s iPhone 12 could also be completely wireless, meaning users will not receive a free pair of earbuds and be forced to purchase the firm’s $159 AirPods.</p>

<p>The news was revealed by well-known Apple product predictor Ming-Chi Kuo, who believes the tech giant may offer promotions or discounts on the AirPods this holiday season.</p>

<p>Kuo also noted that Apple is not expected to release new models of AirPods or AirPods Pro until 2021, 9to5Mac reports. </p>
