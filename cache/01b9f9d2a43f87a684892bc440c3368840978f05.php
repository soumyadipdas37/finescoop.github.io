<p>Revealing how far along she is, the 2017 Love Island star captioned the post: 'Lovely lunch for my younger sister's 27th birthday #36weeks'.   </p>

<p>Not long now: Camilla revealed in the caption just how far along she is</p>

<p>Excited: The happy couple revealed they are expecting a baby over Instagram back in May. Camilla later revealed there's been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but she's 'very happy'</p>

<p>Camilla's post comes after she admitted talking to Andi Peters on Lorraine that there have been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but that she's 'very happy'.</p>

<p>The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.</p>

<p>She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust.</p>

<p>'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. </p>

<p>'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.</p>

<p>'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'</p>

<p>Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World</p>

<p>The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.</p>
