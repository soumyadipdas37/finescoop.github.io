<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They've already released five albums and are preparing to drop their latest Confetti in November.</p>

<p>And now it has been reported that Little Mix earned an impressive £10m in 2019 alone after leaving their X Factor mentor Simon Cowell's music label in 2018.</p>

<p>The latest accounts from their firm Eternal Dance Media Limited show the singers made £6m in 2019 – a £2 million increase from a year earlier, reports The Mirror.</p>

<p>Superstars: Little Mix earned an impressive £10m in 2019 alone after leaving their X Factor mentor Simon Cowell's music label in 2018, according to paperwork</p>

<p>While paperwork for Eternal Magic Touring Limited is also said to show the four stars paid themselves a dividend of £4.6million in 2019.</p>

<p>When considering the two figures together, the band managed to rake in more than £10million for the year.</p>

<p>Little Mix, who were formed on the X Factor in 2011, switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018 amid claims of a feud.  </p>

<p>At the time, Simon insisted he 'never fell out' with the group and that tensions between himself and Little Mix's management, Modest Management, led to an 'embarrassing row' over a songwriting credit for their new track Woman Like Me. </p>

<p>Former mentor: Little Mix were formed on the X Factor in 2011 but switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018</p>

<p>The music mogul even branded the girls 'the hardest working bunch' he has ever worked with.</p>

<p>The new figures come after it was reported that the band had earned a staggering £28.5million since winning The X Factor back in 2011. </p>

<p>The group- Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, Jesy Nelson and Perrie Edwards- made a £938,827 in profit last year, despite not releasing a record, The Sun reports. </p>

<p>In the accounts from their firm Eternal Dance, the near £1million boost brings the net worth of their company to £4,870,417. </p>

<p>The healthy sum comes as the band have just released their new album Confetti, which should add to their growing money pot.  </p>

<p>Feud? At the time there were claims of a feud however Simon has previously insisted he 'never fell out' with the group</p>

<p>And with the launch of their BBC show Little Mix: The Search in the hunt to find the perfect band to tour with them, the quartets' finances should be on the up. </p>

<p>Back in July it was reported that Jesy, Jade and Perrie banked a whopping £700,000 in the past year, after the millions they raked in for their tour. </p>

<p>The girls- minus Leigh-Anne- all set up private companies registered in their first and second names. </p>

<p>The Sun reports Companies House show Jade, 27, was the top earner, with her firm banking £312,959 in accounts dated 31 March 2020.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Perrie, 27, made a profit of £179,508 after deductions were made for bills of her £239,945 she banked for her company Perrie Louise. </p>

<p>Jesy, 29, made a £91,209 profit after banking £144,623. </p>

<p>Candid: It comes after Jade admitted that Little Mix were 'scared of p***ing anyone off' at the start of their career and that they did 'what we were told' (pictured in 2017)</p>

<p>Collectively, the firms, set up in 2018, brought in £700,000 over the past year but £200,000 of that had to be used to pay bills.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jade admitted that Little Mix were 'scared of p***ing anyone off' at the start of their career and that they did 'what we were told'.</p>

<p>The Holiday hitmaker candidly discussed the group's journey in a new interview with Radio Times. </p>

<p>'At the beginning we were so scared of p***ing anyone off and damaging our career, so we did what we were told,' she said. </p>

<p>'We didn't even realise we had a choice, it was pitched as not having one, so you sign what you are told to and you go along with it. As the years went on, we started to realise we didn't like that.'  </p>

<p>Claims: The singer also claimed that the music industry is 'very much dominated by older men' (pictured in 2019) </p>
