<p>Christian Diamant was not given unpaid work by a judge who said he had 'no desire to upset his business'.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old, who owns the White Horse Inn in Bridge, near Canterbury, Kent, admitted three charges of having indecent pictures and videos of children on his iPhone.</p>

<p>Christian Diamant (pictured) a former footman to the Queen found with a stash of child sex images was spared community service so he could continue to run the White Horse Inn in Bridge, near Canterbury, Kent</p>

<p>He was found to have 28 indecent pictures and three videos of children when arrested by police in January.</p>

<p>Diamant served as a footman to the Queen at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle and was also an under-butler for the Queen, serving at state visits and the wedding of Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, in 1999.</p>

<p>But when Diamant appeared for sentencing at Canterbury Crown Court the judge was told he did not have a sexual interest in children and sentenced him to a community rehabilitation order.</p>

<p>The court heard the pub owner admitted having an addiction to chatting with gay men on Grindr and sometimes having video calls and chats online to discuss and watch child sex abuse.</p>

<p>Of the indecent content, the videos and one still picture were of the worst category of abuse, police said.</p>

<p>But his defence solicitor stressed Diamant 'did not have a sexual interest in children' and never shared the content with others.</p>

<p>Diamant was made the subject of a two-year community rehabilitation order with a condition that he attends a sex offenders programme.</p>

<p>He was also made subject of a Sexual Harm Prevention Order which includes restrictions on his use of the internet for the next five years.</p>

<p>Diamant has been allowed to continue to run his pub the White Horse Inn in Bridge, (pictured) near Canterbury, Kent, because the judge said he had 'no desire to upset his business'</p>

<p>The judge, Recorder Stuart Trimmer QC, said Diamant's offending was something he 'slipped into', but that he shows desire to get back on track.</p>

<p>He said: 'You have shown you are deeply ashamed and desperate to address the causes of your offending.</p>

<p>'You've demonstrated steps to address the offending and accepted what you have done. This sentence is to ensure you escape this and do not fall again.'</p>

<p>Recorder Trimmer said he had 'no desire' to order Diamant carry out unpaid work as it would upset his current business at the White Horse.</p>

<p>He took over the White Horse last year, describing himself as a 'fun, flamboyant' pub owner.</p>

<p>When approached for comment after his conviction, he said: 'The judge made his judgement and was sympathetic to me trying to move forward and to protect jobs.'</p>
