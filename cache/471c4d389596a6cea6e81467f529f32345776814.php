<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dancing On Ice pro Hamish Gaman prompted fears that he could miss the forthcoming series of the ITV show after nursing an injury in London on Thursday. </p>

<p>The accomplished pair skater, 37, wore his left arm in a sling as he ventured out in the capital, weeks before rehearsals for the show's thirteenth series are scheduled to begin. </p>

<p>The injury comes as Dancing On Ice bosses prepare to unveil 12 new celebrities for its 2021 edition, which will launch in January.  </p>

<p>Concern: Dancing On Ice pro Hamish Gaman prompted fears that he could miss the forthcoming series of the ITV show after nursing an injury in London on Thursday</p>

<p>Making his way onto the street, Hamish looked relaxed in a  blue T-shirt and matching jeans while using his one free hand to check his phone. </p>

<p>In accordance with current safety guidelines the skater sensibly ensure his face was covered, although he forfeited the conventional mask in favour of a smart paisley bandana. </p>

<p>Should he return to Dancing On Ice, Hamish will no doubt be hoping for better luck after his last partnership with model Caprice Bourret abruptly fell apart mid-way through the show. </p>

<p>Painful: The accomplished pair skater, 37, wore his left arm in a sling as he ventured out in the capital, weeks before rehearsals for the show's thirteenth series are scheduled to begin</p>

<p>Casual: Making his way onto the street, Hamish looked relaxed in a blue T-shirt and matching jeans while using his one free hand to check his phone</p>

<p>Don't mind me: In accordance with current safety guidelines the skater sensibly ensure his face was covered, although he forfeited the conventional mask in favour of a smart paisley bandana</p>

<p>Caprice was reportedly left too scared to speak during Dancing on Ice training after Hamish enforced a 'three strikes and you're out rule' if she didn't do exactly what he said – making her feel like mistakes weren't allowed.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two quit the show to 'recover and look after herself and her family' – days after she was assigned a new professional partner to perform with.</p>

<p>Confirming reports, a spokeswoman for Caprice told MailOnline: 'It's true that Caprice is no longer participating in Dancing On Ice. It's been a hard few months and she's had to keep silent for contractual reasons.</p>

<p>Controversy: Should he return to Dancing On Ice, Hamish will no doubt be hoping for better luck after his last partnership with model Caprice Bourret abruptly fell apart mid-way through the show</p>

<p>'Her mental wellbeing has been affected over the last two months and recent stories leaked to the press are not only salacious but extremely hurtful.</p>

<p>'Now she's taking some time to recover and look after herself and her family.'</p>

<p>Hamish eventually returned to the show for group routines after declaring he was having the worst time of his life, as the aftermath of the feud with Caprice escalated before she eventually quit the series.</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, he wrote: 'Hi everyone. I’m excited to be returning to <?php echo e('@'); ?>dancingonice tonight. Thank you to everyone who reached out to me when I was really struggling.</p>

<p>'It just goes to show how powerful a few kind words can be. When I felt like I was under attack, you were there for me, and I’m so grateful for your support and kindness.'</p>
