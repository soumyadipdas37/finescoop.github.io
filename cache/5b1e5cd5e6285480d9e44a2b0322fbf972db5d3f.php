<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Surfing prodigy, Nate Clark, from Devon has been wowing crowds with his ability to surf standing up - at the age of just four.</p>

<p>The young boy has been riding on his dad Lee's board since he was two but started surfing on his own a year ago.</p>

<p>Nate has proved such a natural out on the water, he can already 'hang ten' - a tricky surfing maneuver where the surfer curls their toes over the edge of the board - and ride waves with the best of them.</p>

<p>Nate Clark, age four, from Westward Ho!, a seaside village in Devon, can already stand up on the surfboard and ride the waves with ease</p>

<p>He honed his skills during lockdown with regular trips into the sea at his local beach.</p>

<p>And his parents Katie and Lee Clark say all eyes are on him while he surfs with on-lookers staggered by the skills that defy his tiny frame and tender age.</p>

<p>Katie, 39, of Westward Ho!, a seaside village in Devon, said: 'We have always taken him in the sea and he was always familiar with it, but when he was about two he would go on his dad's board.</p>

<p>'Nate's sister Gracie then got a surfboard and he took inspiration from her. He basically nicked her board and started himself. </p>

<p>'He has got really good this year. During lockdown he practiced a lot.</p>

<p>'He is a natural and has taken to it really well. You can see by his face he absolutely loves it.</p>

<p>The surfing prodigy has been riding on his dad Lee's board since he was two but started surfing on his own a year ago and is a natural in the water</p>

<p>Nate needs help from his dad Lee to paddle out because of the size of the surfboard, but when he spots a wave he can take it on himself</p>

<p>'He takes every opportunity to go into the water. He is a little way off being able to do tricks, but he can surf a wave standing up and balance on the board.</p>

<p>'We are so proud of him and just happy to see him doing something he loves.</p>

<p>'People are amazed when they see him. He looks so tiny on the board and all eyes are on him when he is surfing.'</p>

<p>Katie says he needs help from his dad to paddle out due to the size of the board, but he then spots a wave and goes for it.</p>

<p>She says Nate tells his dad: 'I want to go for that bad boy.'</p>

<p>His mum Katie, 39, and dad Lee, 37, also a surfer, say they are so proud of him and just happy to see their son doing something he loves. Pictured: Lee and Katie Clark with son Nate</p>

<p>Katie said he was just enjoying it as a hobby for now, but if he continues to progress they will look at entering him in competitions.</p>

<p>She added: 'There are local competitions set up for younger children so if he sticks to it we'll start by entering him for that. </p>

<p>'He thinks it is great and just says 'I love surfing' all the time.</p>

<p>'We are only five mins from the beach so he is in a perfect place to hone his talents.'</p>

<p>Katie said her husband Lee Clark, 37, a carpenter, has been a surfer for around 15 years and their daughter Gracie, ten, also enjoys it.</p>
