<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A personal trainer and registered pharmacist has shared her favourite low calorie sweet foods, and revealed she has such a 'sweet tooth' that she eats dessert after lunch and dinner every day.</p>

<p>Holly Louise, from the Gold Coast, said she loves something sweet after her meals, but also likes to stay in shape and so needs to pick treats that aren't too high in calories but also satisfy her cravings.</p>

<p>'To make the dieting process easier, it's best to include more low calorie, high volume foods in your diet to help with controlling hunger levels and satisfying your cravings,' Holly said on her Instagram profile.</p>

<p>'Here are just a few of my fave low calorie sweet foods that I incorporate into my diet on a daily basis.</p>

<p>She added: 'The more enjoyable and sustainable your diet is, the easier it will be and better your results will be.' </p>

<p>Holly said she has such a sweet tooth that she eats dessert after lunch and dinner every day (some of her favourite low-calorie treats pictured)</p>

<p>Holly explained she regularly fills her supermarket trolley with Cadbury Milk Chocolate Cake Bars (93 calories per bar) and Chocolate Fudge Brownies by Fibre One, which have just 90 calories in a single brownie (left and right)</p>

<p>Holly (pictured) follows a macronutrient approach to dieting, whereby she eats whatever she wants, provided it fits her macros</p>

<p>When it comes to what she buys in the supermarket, Holly explained she regularly fills her supermarket trolley with Cadbury Milk Chocolate Cake Bars (93 calories per bar) and Chocolate Fudge Brownies by Fibre One, which have just 90 calories in a single brownie. </p>

<p>She also loves to buy Aunt Betty's Creamy Rice pudding in the Apple and Cinnamon flavour.</p>

<p>These cost just $3, and have 121 calories, meaning you'll feel satiated without having to eat anything to reach for biscuits and lollies.</p>

<p>The personal trainer and pharmacist (pictured) said she eats healthily 80 per cent of the time, and a little of what she loves 20 per cent of the time</p>

<p>Holly invests in healthy ice cream by Twisted, which has 75 calories per mini tub, features no added sugar (left); She is also a fan of the celebrity-endorsed Avalanche hot chocolate, which is 99 per cent sugar-free (right)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Breakfast: Oatmeal with protein powder, grated zucchini, berries and shredded coconut and a coffee.</p></li>
<li><p>Lunch: Rice cakes with avocado, tuna slices in olive oil and a piece of fruit.</p></li>
<li><p>Afternoon tea: Smoothie with protein powder, frozen fruit and unsweetened almond milk or a Body Science protein bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Dinner: Chicken/beef, rice (black, brown or white), vegetables and a delicious sauce.</p></li>
<li><p>Dessert: Popcorn with a Skinny Cow ice cream sundae.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Holly invests in healthy ice cream by Twisted, which has 75 calories per mini tub, features no added sugar and includes probiotics to ensure you are as healthy on the inside as you are on the outside.</p>

<p>She is also a fan of the celebrity-endorsed Avalanche hot chocolate, which is 99 per cent sugar-free and boasts a host of fans including Sydney eyebrow guru Kristin Fisher.</p>

<p>The hot chocolate is a huge hit with shoppers because it contains the natural sweetener stevia and erythritol - which contains six per cent of the calories of sugar, but 70 per cent of the sweetness. </p>

<p>Finally, the pharmacist buys sugar-free maple syrup to drizzle over her protein pancakes before the gym, and Coles ice cream wafers.</p>

<p>While they sound fattening, these have just 63 calories per wafer.</p>

<p>Holly said she occasionally eats jelly and drinks Diet Rite cordial with no added sugar.</p>

<p>The Sara Lee Berry Bliss Cheesecake is another favourite food in her household, as a single slice has just 140 calories, while YoPro's high protein yoghurts offer the perfect way for her to stay fuelled for a workout.</p>

<p>A typical day on Holly's plate features something like oatmeal with protein powder, grated zucchini, berries and shredded coconut for breakfast, before something with protein and veg for lunch (pictured)</p>

<p>Holly previously told FEMAIL that she follows the macronutrient approach to dieting, whereby she is allowed to eat as she wants, provided it meets her daily requirements for protein, fat and carbohydrates.</p>

<p>'The focus is on reaching these targets as the driver of your results, with food selection left up to you,' Holly told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'With this being said, at least 80 per cent of the foods you eat on a daily basis should be composed of nutritious whole foods, while 20 per cent can be used for more processed foods.' </p>

<p>A typical day on Holly's plate features something like oatmeal with protein powder, grated zucchini, berries and shredded coconut for breakfast.</p>

<p>She typically lunches on rice cakes with avocado, tuna slices in olive oil and a piece of fruit, while her lunchtime dessert could be a smoothie with protein powder, frozen fruit and unsweetened almond milk. </p>

<p>Dinner is usually chicken or beef, rice (black, brown or white), vegetables and a 'delicious sauce'.</p>

<p>The pharmacist's dinnertime dessert is often one of her favourite low calorie treats, or popcorn and a Skinny Cow ice cream sundae. </p>
