<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenage girl has won an award for her design for a new type of remote controlled skateboard dubbed the 'Electrodeck' that can reach speeds of 10mph.</p>

<p>The skateboard is an innovative way to make skaters go faster and do more tricks without ever having to take their feet off the board, competition organisers claim.</p>

<p>Charlotte Geary, from Bournemouth, presented her invention to judges including cycling champion Mark Cavendish as part of the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET)'s Sports of the Future competition. </p>

<p>The teenager's design kick-flipped her into first place and now her idea has been turned into a prototype that she has been able to ride as part of the prize. </p>

<p>Sport of the Future competition ran during lockdown and challenged children to come up with a new sport or an invention that makes an existing sport even better.</p>

<p>Other designs included robots you can play football with, a gun that fires chicken nuggets at athletes to keep them sustained and a ball that returns to you. </p>

<p>Charlotte Geary, aged 13 from Bournemouth, unveils a prototype of her winning invention the Electrodeck, which is an electric skateboard that allows skaters to accelerate and turn without having to take their feet off the board</p>

<p>Charlotte's original design for the electrodeck won her first prize in the competition and led to her idea being turned into a working prototype</p>

<p>Miss Geary won the overall prize for her board with a 400W hub motor that is operated by a bluetooth remote that lets the rider change speed and direction. </p>

<p>'The Electrodeck brings together emerging technology and striking design to create an exciting addition to the sports of the future,' an IET spokesperson said. </p>

<p>Some entries were inspired by social distancing restrictions, including the 'Squennis Ball' that automatically returns to you so you can play without a partner. </p>

<p>Another design submitted by children included social distancing trainers that light up if you're within 6f of someone else.</p>

<p>The competition was open for children aged between five and 13 and is the latest in a line of 'future inventor' style competitions organised by the IET.</p>

<p>'Some people have a misconception about what engineering is. Our research has highlighted that 54 per cent of children don’t know anything about careers in engineering,' a spokesperson for the IET said. </p>

<p>'But the reality is that some of their favourite things involve a serious amount of engineering – they just don’t know it!'</p>

<p>The judging panel included Cavendish, IET President Peter Bonfield and IET Young Woman Engineer of the Year Ying Wan Loh.</p>

<p>They awarded second place to nine-year-old Isabella Watson-Gandy from London with 'Boing Boots' that would give her an extra spring in her step to play basketball with her older brother. </p>

<p>Among the entries submitted for the competition was a chicken nugget gun that can shoot nuggets at sumo wrestlers</p>

<p>One future engineer proposed a ball that can bounce back at you so you can play alone</p>

<p>Another invention was a hovering torso that could be used for fencing as a target so that 'you don't make dents in your walls'</p>

<p>The third spot went to nine-year-old Brunner Hahn, also from London, who designed a door that could be converted into a table tennis set.</p>

<p>Miss Geary said: 'The Sports of the Future competition seemed like a massive opportunity to put an invention I had been coming up with for a while into action. </p>

<p>'The whole idea behind it is a motor-powered, multi-directional skateboard. I named this the Electrodeck,' she said.</p>

<p>'When I found out I actually won, I was speechless. Hundreds of people enter these kinds of competitions all the time and so you never expect to be the one who actually wins!'</p>

<p>Judge and IET President Peter Bonfield said there was a brilliant response from young people to the competition - something he found 'uplifting'.</p>

<p>'The levels of creativity, ingenuity, skill and passion were so impressive – I'd like to thank all those who entered for making our judges' jobs very challenging! </p>

<p>'Most of all, I hope it's encouraged those who have taken part to realise imagining the impossible is not only fun, but it can lead to inventions that will make the world a better and more exciting place in the future.'</p>

<p>Other competitions organised by the IET for children included work with the Beano comic called 'Engineer a Better World' that challenged six to 16-year olds to re-design something they couldn't live without if they moved to another planet.</p>

<p>The winner, Elin, 10, had the opportunity to launch her clarinet to the edge of the atmosphere and then see it land safely.</p>
