<p>Ms Abu-Eid, a 31-year-old mother-of-three from Sydney's inner-west, has built an Instagram following of 88,000 since she started to share her simple recipes in 2019</p>

<p>Among the most popular is what she calls her 'lazy cake' made from cream, chocolate and biscuits of your choice.</p>

<p>Ms Abu-Eid used a mix of Lotus and Arnott's chocolate and coffee flavours in her cake, but encouraged followers to get creative when choosing their own.</p>

<p>Perfect for busy mums strapped for time, the cake can be prepared in less than 10 minutes and keeps for days if stored in an airtight container, because it doesn't contain eggs or other ingredients that spoil easily.</p>

<p>To follow the recipe, the recipe, which is so simple it's virtually impossible to mess up, home cooks will need 600ml of thickened cream, 700g of milk chocolate and three packets of biscuits.</p>

<p>Perfect for busy mums strapped for time, the biscuit cake (pictured) can be prepared in under 10 minutes without turning on the oven</p>

<p>Outlining her method in an Instagram post Sunday, Ms Abu-Eid said she starts by mixing the cream with the chocolate in a saucepan set over a medium heat until the chocolate has melted.</p>

<p>Next, she said she breaks the biscuits into bite-sized pieces and stirs them into the chocolate, mixing well to ensure they're coated evenly.</p>

<p>Once the biscuits have been thoroughly covered, Ms Abu-Eid said she lines a tray with cling wrap and pours the mixture on top.</p>

<p>It should be frozen until firm, for a few hours or ideally overnight, then flipped onto a plate and served with fresh strawberries. </p>
