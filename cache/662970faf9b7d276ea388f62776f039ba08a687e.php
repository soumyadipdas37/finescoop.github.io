<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The family of AFL star Shane Tuck have donated his brain for concussion research to 'help other people' after the former Richmond player took his own life. </p>

<p>Shane, who is the son of Hawthorn great Michael Tuck, was just 38 years old when his life was abruptly cut short on July 20. </p>

<p>His younger brother Travis, 32, said he is 'very proud' that his parents decided to donate his older brother's brain to the Australian Sports Brain Bank in Sydney. </p>

<p>'We will see what comes of that (research). We don't have the answers still, but we're hoping that might bring us a few more answers,' Travis told The Herald Sun.   </p>

<p>'We hope it can help other people.' </p>

<p>Shane Tuck (pictured with his wife Katherine) was just 38 years old when he took his own life on July 20. Now, Tuck's family have donated his brain for concussion research in hopes it will 'help other people'</p>

<p>Travis said concussions and self-worth issues following his brother's AFL retirement 'may have contributed to Shane's struggles'. </p>

<p>'And Shane getting involved with boxing, there might be a few concussions over time with football and boxing,' he said. </p>

<p>Shane Tuck played 173 games and kicked 74 goals for the Richmond Tigers between 2004 and 2013.  </p>

<p>After retiring from AFL in 2013, Tuck went on to become a professional boxer, fighting in five matches from November 2015 to August 2017. </p>

<p>Concussion research on Shane's brain could prove invaluable and save lives in the AFL, given the recent groundbreaking analysis of the late Danny Frawley's brain. </p>

<p>Shane Tuck played his final game for the Tigers in 2013 (right) and began boxing (right) in 2015. His brother said concussions and self-worth issues following his AFL retirement 'may have contributed to Shane's struggles'</p>

<p>Analysis of Frawley's brain revealed he had suffered from a neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated head knocks and concussions at the time of his death.</p>

<p>The disease, known as Stage II chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), can cause depression and suicidal thoughts and is only detectable after death.   </p>

<p>Frawley's wife of 30 years, Anita said she was grateful for the Australian Sports Brain Bank, which is shining a light on the disease. </p>

<p>She hopes a greater understanding of CTE will prevent other families from suffering in the same way. </p>

<p>Brain analysis of the late Danny Frawley (pictured second right with his family) lead to him becoming the second AFL player to be diagnosed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)</p>

<p>Tuck's sister Renee and father Michael speak at his funeral. The Tuck family are looking for 'more answers' now that they have donated the Shane's brain to the Australian Sports Brain Bank</p>

<p>Frawley is the second AFL player to be diagnosed with CTE, after legendary ruckman Graham 'Polly' Farmer was confirmed to have Stage III CTE in February.</p>

<p>The Tuck family are also looking for 'more answers' now that they have donated Shane's brain to the Australian Sports Brain Bank. </p>

<p>Shane Tuck is survived by his wife Kat and children Will and Ava. </p>
