<p>'I would say that my neuroses around that have really amped up because of the small child and my mother,' she told the publication. 'I guess it’s not even neuroses at this point, it’s just what everybody is doing. It’s common.' </p>

<p>'I like to push him around in the stroller, and a lot of people walk by shouting without masks on. Like, just put it on! Is it that hard?' she said.  </p>
