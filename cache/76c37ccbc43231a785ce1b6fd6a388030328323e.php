<p>'Why yes! See you back on screen OCTOBER 11 <?php echo e('@'); ?>channel10au with a host of the most inspiring mini MasterChefs! I can't wait for you to meet them.' </p>

<p>Contestants for this year's season include Ruby, Etka, Laura, Porsha, Tiffany, Ben, Salvo, Filo, Georgia, Dev, Phenix, Carter and Vienna, with all aged between nine and 14.</p>

<p>It also includes the son of former MasterChef Australia winner Sashi Cheliah, 11-year-old Ryan.</p>

<p>They're back! Judges Jock Zonfrillo, Melissa Leong and Andy Allen (pictured) will return to screens nationwide on the junior series of the hit cooking show</p>

<p>The young boy was a familiar face on the hit cooking show in 2018, standing alongside his father during a family reunion.</p>

<p>Despite this, Sashi is adamant the young, aspiring cook was not recognised by producers until the first stage of the casting process on Junior MasterChef Australia.</p>

<p>'I put in an application and then they called for an audition. So it's only after the audition that they realised Ryan is my son,' Sashi said, as reported by HuffPost Australia last week.</p>

<p>Celebration: Former MasterChef Australia winner Sashi Cheliah's son Ryan will also be competing on this year's Junior MasterChef. Pictured, Ryan hugging Sashi on MasterChef</p>

<p>But Ryan is keen to make a name for himself in the culinary world, instead of being simply known as 'Sashi's son'. </p>

<p>'People are going to know me for me, Ryan, instead of, "Oh that's Sashi's son",' the young cook told HuffPost Australia. </p>

<p>'My favourite thing to cook is a fish curry. Even though it may be a bit complicated, it's full of flavour and I really like eating it.'</p>

<p>Aspiring chefs: Contestants aged between nine and 14 years for this year's season include Ruby (pictured), Etka, Laura, Porsha, Tiffany, Ben, Salvo, Filo, Georgia, Dev, Phenix, Carter, Vienna and Ryan</p>

<p>Professional baker Reece Hignell, who competed on the latest season of MasterChef Australia, offered a few words of advice to the upcoming contestants on Monday.</p>

<p>'Okay, so all of those people in MasterChef Junior, if you are baking, I just want to say that the blast chiller is your best friend,' Reece, 30, said in a video uploaded to Instagram.</p>

<p>'Like if you need to cool a cake, if you need to chill an ice cream, parfait, a mousse... chuck anything into that blast chiller and get it nice and cold.'</p>
