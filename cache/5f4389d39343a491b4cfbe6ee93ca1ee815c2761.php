<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The biggest names in television are being honored for their work at the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards in Los Angeles despite COVID-19.</p>

<p>But host Jimmy Kimmel made sure that those working on the front lines of the pandemic received some well deserved time in the spotlight during Sunday evening's show. </p>

<p>'You know, we're not just celebrating ourselves tonight. We're also shining a light on doctors, nurses, teachers, farmers, truckers -- people who do so much to keep this country going,' said Kimmel as he spoke to directly to colleagues and viewers.</p>

<p>'Tonight, we invited some of them, our essential workers, to be part of the show and hand out awards to those who are much less essential than they are.'</p>

<p>Sharing the spotlight: Host Jimmy Kimmel made sure that those working on the front lines of the pandemic received some well deserved time in the spotlight during Sunday evening's 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards</p>

<p>Kimmel then handed off the virtual microphone to the first of many essential workers that graced the screen during the show.</p>

<p>Cindy, a U.S. History teacher, reflected on the monumental nature of the pandemic and how it has affected the lives of not just her own students, but students across the nation. </p>

<p>'I'm teaching history and living through history, and when the pandemic started, I thought, "Hey, I'll see my kids in a week or two." And then those weeks turned into months,' she began, reflecting on the lengthiness of lockdown.</p>

<p>She took a moment to communicate directly to her student who are currently adjusting to learning at home.</p>

<p>'I can't wait to come back to work just to see their faces. So to my former and current students, I love you. I miss you. And to the nominees for outstanding supporting actors in a comedy series, I love y'all, too. Good luck.' </p>

<p>Living through history: Cindy, a U.S. History teacher, reflected on the monumental nature of the pandemic and how it has affected the lives of not just her own students, but students across the nation</p>

<p>UPS Delivery Driver Tim Lloyd of Alabama was next to present the award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series.</p>

<p>But, before unveiling the category's winner, Lloyd took a moment to reflect on his duties and the kindness he has received from customers throughout the pandemic.   </p>

<p>'The love that I've received from my customers has been awesome. Especially the one that had a mask made for me. It was hanging on the door when I made a delivery, and it almost made me cry,' recalled Lloyd, while donning his work uniform.</p>

<p>Lloyd noted how much pride he feels towards his position and the power that comes with effectively serving the community during a time of need.</p>

<p>Never stopping: UPS Delivery Driver Tim Lloyd of Alabama was next to present the award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series</p>

<p>Outstanding Actress: And Lloyd had the honor of presenting Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy with her first-ever Emmy award on Sunday night for her unforgettable performance as Alexis Rose</p>

<p>'I pull up, and they say, we're just checking on you. They've been awesome. I love bringing smiles to people's faces. Much like the nominees for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series.'</p>

<p>And Lloyd had the honor of presenting Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy with her first-ever Emmy award on Sunday night for her unforgettable performance as Alexis Rose.</p>

<p>Montana shepherd and rancher Caroline Nelson gave viewers at home a look at her life spent cultivating the food that ends up on the plates of millions of Americans.</p>

<p>She also stressed how the pandemic has added to the workload and pressures felt by farmers who have continued to do their part in providing for communities across the nation.</p>

<p>'I've always known farmers and ranchers are tough, but it's never been more evident than in the pandemic. If everybody knew the farmer that raised their food, the world would be a little bit of a happier place.</p>

<p>Farm life: Montana shepherd and rancher Caroline Nelson gave viewers at home a look at her life spent cultivating the food that ends up on the plates of millions of Americans</p>

<p>Duran, also known as Jacinda Lady Truck’n on social media, explained to viewers at home that she is 'a third generation lady truck driver' and that 'especially during this pandemic, the community depends on us to continue bringing the needs.'</p>

<p>She encouraged citizens to voice their appreciate to the truck drivers they see that have remained committed to their essential services. </p>

<p>'So let us truck drivers out here know that we're appreciated. A pat on the back, or a thumbs-up goes a long ways. We've continued going during the pandemic and keep going after,' concluded Duran.</p>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic put the United States at a standstill in March with the majority of the country entering lockdown in an attempt to deter its spread.</p>

<p>Wearing face masks, maintaining proper social-distancing, and wielding hand sanitizer are just some of the precautions citizens were forced to adopt. </p>

<p>Hollywood completely shutdown in late March, which forced active projects to hit pause and swept many impending projects to the infinite wayside.</p>

<p>Sunday evening's Emmy Award ceremony, prior to the pandemic, was set for its usual format, a live audience at the Microsoft Theatre in Downtown Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Empty: In order to adhere to COVID-19 precautions, Jimmy Kimmel was forced to perform his hosting duties for an empty audience at the Staples Center</p>

<p>But, due to the aggressive and looming nature of the pandemic, it was decided that the 2020 award show would be moved to a mostly virtual format.</p>

<p>In a statement published in July, ABC and the Television Academy said that they intended on delivering 'a live show that is both celebratory and safe.' </p>

<p>So, in order to adhere to COVID-19 precautions, Jimmy Kimmel was forced to perform his hosting duties for an empty audience at the Staples Center. </p>

<p>Most nominees virtually attended the annual award show via webcam, while some, such as Jennifer Aniston and Zendaya, appeared at the iconic venue alongside Kimmel. </p>

<p>Presenters in full hazmat gear, personally delivered awards to winners' homes.</p>
