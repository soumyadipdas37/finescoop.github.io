<p>They are no longer on talking terms, with an insider recently telling E! News: 'They have been off and on for two months.</p>

<p>'Sofia really pushed to make things work between them after they initially broke up, but Scott officially called it off recently and they are no longer speaking. Friends attributed their 15-year age difference becoming an issue.</p>

<p>'He's in a very much different place in his life, really focused on a more quiet lifestyle, his kids and his investment businesses. And Sofia, at 21 years, really still trying to figure what she wants to do which drove them apart over time.'</p>
