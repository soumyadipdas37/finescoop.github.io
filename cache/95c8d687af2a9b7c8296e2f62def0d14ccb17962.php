<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wests Tigers legend Benji Marshall turned down an offer to bring his family on the field for his final game in a swipe to the club after learning through the media he would not be re-signed. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old chose to walk his honorary lap alone to mark his sendoff at Bankwest Stadium, in western Sydney, on Saturday night.</p>

<p>His wife Zoe and son Fox were nowhere to be seen while outgoing teammate Chris Lawrence accompanied Marshall with his daughter Emme and wife Kathrynn.</p>

<p>The NRL had successfully applied for an exemption for the two players to have their families on the field following the Wests Tigers v Eels showdown.</p>

<p> The 35-year-old's decision not to bring his family out was a bitter swipe to the club that ruthlessly decided to drop him for 2021</p>

<p>But Marshall refused the invitation following the team's decision to let him go, according to The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>Marshall had been hoping to play for another year with the Tigers, and only found out he would not be re-signed for 2021 after reading a report.</p>

<p>The decision to drop Marshall shocked faithful fans of the club, with over 10,000 people signing an online petition calling for him to be re-signed.</p>

<p>'This isn't the way to treat a club legend!!!' the campaign read.</p>

<p>'Benji deserves to play as a tiger for his final season in 2021'. </p>

<p>Marshall is just one of eight players to leave Wests Tigers by the end of the year. </p>

<p>Matt Eisenhuth, Dylan Smith, Robert Jennings and Oliver Clark will also not be re-signed.</p>

<p>None of the players have been picked up by other clubs so far, including Marshall.</p>

<p>Tigers coach Michael Maguire said he was hopeful the 35-year-old would return in a different capacity.</p>

<p>'I would like to think when things get sorted out he is around the club,' Maguire said.</p>

<p>'I see him in the future potentially in coaching positions in different opportunities in the club.</p>

<p>'He loves the club, he loves the Wests Tigers.</p>

<p>'You are always making big decisions as a club with list management. You have to move forward.</p>

<p>'But moving forward off the field I want Benji Marshall to be part of the club.' </p>

<p>Marshall is the second most capped player in Wests Tigers and has played 253 games for the club.</p>

<p>He made his debut in 2003 and quickly cemented himself as a star player.  </p>

<p>Marshall carried the team to victory during its maiden Premiership in 2005 and was made an inaugural life member in 2013.</p>

<p>He briefly left the team in 2014 and headed to New Zealand to play Super Rugby for Auckland's Blues.</p>

<p>Wests Tigers welcomed him back to the club in 2018. </p>
