<p>Luxury fashion house has been handed £573,000 to make personal protective equipment for healthcare workers</p>

<p>Two months later, Burberry was handed a £573,000 contract to make gowns and protective equipment.</p>

<p>The contract was not advertised to other potential suppliers, according to Government records published yesterday. </p>

<p>EU rules allow the Government to circumvent the usual processes if only one supplier is capable of delivering on the contract, or if unforeseen events mean speed is vital.</p>

<p>During the early days of the pandemic several luxury fashion brands turned their production lines over to make desperately needed PPE.</p>
