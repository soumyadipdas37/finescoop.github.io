<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian shopper has created an incredible one-off dress using 11 tea towels from Kmart, inspiring others to take up sewing as a hobby.</p>

<p>Selika Harris, 37, started sewing quilts in her spare time a decade ago but lost interest after two years. Three years ago she was poised to pick up a needle and thread again, this time to piece together garments.</p>

<p>'I saw some people on the Australian sewing advice and inspiration Facebook page used this tea towel to make bucket hats so I was thinking I could make a dress from it as it's so pretty,' the shopper from Croydon in Victoria told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>The tea towel, which costs $1.50, features a peach-coloured backdrop with cockatoos perched on branches.</p>

<p>An Australian shopper has created an incredible one-off dress using 11 tea towels from Kmart, inspiring others to take up sewing as a hobby</p>

<p>'I went to Kmart to get something else and I grabbed seven tea towels as well before ordering more later,' she said.</p>

<p>She had the vision for the dress in her head so it didn't take long to piece together the material, sew in a zipper and post the finished product to social media. </p>

<p>'I pretty much sewed two big pieces of three tea towels for the gathered skirt, back and front pieces. Then I sewed two pieces each for the bodice back and front, plus sleeves,' she said. </p>

<p>This is the first time she has crafted something made out of 'odd materials', usually just using regular store-bought fabric to make dresses, jumpers and skirts. </p>

<p>And her fellow Australian Kmart shoppers adored the final outcome.</p>

<p>'Looks fabulous! Makes me want to do a refresher on the sewing machine and get cracking on some great creations - super inspired,' said one woman.</p>

<p>'Now that is a clever hack! Great job, love your creativity,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I am in love. That is incredible! You should take orders. I'll take one please'.</p>

<p>Some people had even tried to make other pieces out of the same tea towel.</p>

<p>'I used a couple of the exact same tea towel to make some face masks and got the rest of one turned into a shoulder bag and a coin purse,' one lady said.</p>

<p>'I thought making a floor cushion was a good idea but this is way better!' Said another.</p>
