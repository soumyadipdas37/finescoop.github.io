<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Weeknd called for justice for prominent Black victims of police violence on Sunday at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old singer took to the stage twice during the evening to accept awards, including the prestigious Video of the Year moonperson for Blinding Lights.</p>

<p>He kept his acceptance speeches to a minimum while calling for 'justice' for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor. </p>

<p>Justice: The Weeknd, 30, called for 'justice' for Jacob Blake and Breonna Taylor on Sunday while accepting two awards at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards</p>

<p>'Thank you, VMAs and MTV,' he began during his first win of the evening for Best R&amp;B for Blinding Lights.'I want to thank Lamar Taylor and Anton Tammi for the video.'</p>

<p>He continued the short speech by mentioning two Black people injured or killed by police in the past year.  </p>

<p>'It's hard for me to celebrate right now and enjoy this moment. So I'm just going to say justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor. Thank you.'</p>

<p>When the Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye)came on stage toward the end of the distanced ceremony he repeated his speech almost word for word and with a similar cadence, raising the possibility that the pre-taped speeches were recorded back-to-back. </p>

<p>Short and sweet: 'It's hard for me to celebrate right now and enjoy this moment,' he said. 'So I'm just going to say justice for Jacob Blake and justice for Breonna Taylor. Thank you'</p>

<p>The Can't Feel My Face singer was made-up to look as if he'd been beaten up, and his face was coated with blood smears and fake lacerations. </p>

<p>In the winning video for Blinding Lights, he's seen being being beat up by club bouncers. </p>

<p>The look was all the more disturbing when paired with an invocation of Black people who had been gunned down by police.</p>

<p>Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police officers while he was outside of an apartment building in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23.</p>

<p>Though he survived his injuries, Blake is currently paralyzed and was initially shackled to his bed by police, though he was later freed of his restraints. </p>

<p>Shooting: Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on August 23. He's currently paralyzed, and his injuries have inspired protests in Kenosha and elsewhere; protests seen on Saturday in Kenosha</p>

<p>Counterprotest: A group of Blue Lives Matter protesters supported police officers in counter protests on Sunday. On Tuesday, 17-year-old Blue Lives Matter supporter Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two protestors and injured a third</p>

<p>It was later reported that he had been tased twice by officers, and the allegation that he had a knife in his car at the time was selectively released later by police.</p>

<p>The shooting kicked off days of ongoing unrest in Kenosha and around the country.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse drove from his home in Antioch, Illinois, to Kenosha, where he was accused of shooting and killing to protestors with an assault rifle, as well as injuring a third.</p>

<p>Since then, he has been charged with first-degree intentional homicide.</p>

<p>Gunned down: Breonna Taylor, a Black EMT, was shot eight times by police in her Louisville, Kentucky, home after the executed an illegal no-knock warrant; Taylor pictured on the left</p>

<p>Taylor was shot and killed in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, by police on March 13.</p>

<p>The Black EMT who was shot eight times by officers when they entered her home using an illegal no-knock warrant.</p>

<p>The police were searching for a suspect who didn't even live with Taylor and who was already in police custody at the time of the raid that killed her.</p>

<p>Though her death didn't initially inspire protests, the uprising following the police killing of George Floyd created renewed interest in her killing.</p>

<p>Seeing red: The Weeknd was dressed in a scarlet blazer with peak over a black shirt and matching tie and black trousers</p>

<p>On theme: The look, including the injury makeup, was part of his character for his album After Hours, and he's worn the look during multiple appearances and performances</p>

<p>He finished the ensemble with black and white loafers and wore thick black leather gloves.</p>
