<p>Spilling the tea! The Bachelor's Steph Harper (pictured) has revealed some surprising new details about the ongoing feud between Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska</p>

<p>'I do think Bella was justified [in calling out Irena]. She had a reaction to something, and yes, she might have gone a bit OTT, but in the mansion, who doesn't? I know I had my moments there,' she continued.</p>

<p>'I've had contact with the girls off the record and I'm aware a lot of stuff was said about Bella that wasn't very nice, so I understand where she's coming from.'</p>

<p>Steph doubled down on her claims in a separate interview with Pedestrian. </p>

<p>'As we were leaving the mansion – we were on our way home – Irena had a bit to say to me about Bella,' Steph explained.</p>

<p>'There's a lot of stuff that you don't see between Bella and Irena - so much happened,' Steph told Now To Love. (Pictured: Bella)</p>

<p>While she didn't elaborate on what was said, she did reveal that they 'weren’t very nice things'. </p>

<p>'then I actually got a chance to chat to Bella when we got back into the mansion and I figured out that Irena had said a lot of things to both of us about the other person and it was all just lies.'</p>

<p>During Wednesday's episode of The Bachelor, Bella accused Irena of 'manipulating her way through the show'.</p>

<p>'As we were leaving the mansion – we were on our way home – Irena had a bit to say to me about Bella,' Steph explained. (Pictured: Irena) </p>

<p>'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.</p>

<p>'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women.</p>

<p>Bachelor fans flocked to Twitter to slam the brunette's behaviour and labelled her a 'hypocrite'.</p>

<p>'If anyone's manipulating Locky now it's you Bella,' one person wrote, while another added: 'You used to be my favourite!'</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10</p>
