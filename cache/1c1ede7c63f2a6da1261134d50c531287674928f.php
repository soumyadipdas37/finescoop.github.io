<p>Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna told MailOnline: 'Things are turning more unsettled and cloudy now.</p>

<p>'We're seeing showery rain across the south-east at the moment, which will clear but by lunchtime another band of rain will sweep in.</p>

<p>'They'll be plenty of bright weather in Scotland and Northern Ireland and it will be low to mid-teens in the north and west.</p>

<p>'Conditions will turn quite cold overnight, with air temperatures dropping down to freezing in parts of Scotland.'</p>

<p>Things are unlikely to improve until Saturday, the forecaster explained.</p>

<p>'Tomorrow is looking like a very unsettled day with squally showers and thunder in places,' he said.</p>

<p>'The highest temperatures will be around 13C to 15C, which is about 10 degrees down from what there's been recently.</p>

<p>'Then on Friday the showery weather will push towards the east but temperatures will continue struggling in the mid-teens.</p>

<p>'The weekend looks much more promising with bright weather around but it will stay chilly.' </p>
