<p>Sean said of the series: 'Getting to be involved in a Jimmy McGovern drama again is a real privilege and it will be great to be reunited with Stephen. </p>

<p>'Mark Hebden is another of Jimmy’s complex and superbly-written characters and I am looking forward to bringing him to life on screen.'</p>

<p>Stephen added: 'It is an absolute honour to be working with Jimmy again, I’m feeling blessed. I’m excited to be working with Lewis as I have heard so many incredible things about him as a director, I can’t wait to get stuck in. Of course, I am made up to be back on set with Sean.'</p>

<p>Stephen, who is also known for his role as John Corbett in Line of Duty, previously admitted he suffered from 'imposter syndrome for a long time' due to his working class background.</p>

<p>The star confessed he previously thought he 'didn't deserve' to be successful in the acting industry, but expressed his gratitude towards his parents for making his career 'possible' in a new interview for Rankin's Hunger Magazine.</p>

<p>He said: 'I suffered a lot with that imposter syndrome for a long time, that working-class mentality of "I don’t deserve to here".'</p>

<p>Thanking his relatives for supporting his path, the Boardwalk Empire actor added: 'If it wasn’t for my mum and dad, and if it wasn’t being able to get a grant to go to college, it would never have been possible for me.</p>

<p>'My fear is how many people lose out on those opportunities because they’re not given the opportunity to at least have a go at it, which is very sad.'</p>
