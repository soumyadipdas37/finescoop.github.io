<p>The common dolphin has been enchanting people on jet ski tours off Weymouth, Dorset, in recent weeks.</p>

<p>I'm having some dol-fun: Danny the dolphin leaps from the English Channel off Weymouth</p>

<p>There's some fin in the air tonight: Danny's aerobatic display amazes watching jet-skiiers</p>

<p>He has been given the name Danny and even has his own Facebook fan page with over 4,000 members.</p>

<p>Dan Bell, an instructor at Jurassic Jetski Tours, said: 'Danny knew we were out in the water.</p>

<p>'We got some amazing shots. He certainly isn't camera shy around us.'</p>

<p>Danny is said to enjoy the sensation of the jet of water from the high-speed crafts on his belly.</p>
