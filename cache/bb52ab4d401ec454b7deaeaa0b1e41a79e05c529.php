<p>Romance: Kerry Katona, 40, looked on cloud nine as she showed off her engagement ring on a stroll with her fiancé Ryan Mahoney, 31</p>

<p>The former Atomic Kitten star wrapped up for the day in a white coat while she styled her blonde locks into an updo. </p>

<p>Kerry also carried a brown handbag with her as she gazed lovingly at Ryan, who proposed to her in Spain just before her 40th birthday.</p>

<p>Health and nutrition expert Ryan also opted for a laid back look, donning a black T-shirt along with a pair of grey tracksuit bottoms.  </p>

<p>Kerry previously uploaded a video of Ryan getting down on one knee to pop the question - a plan her children and pals were already aware of.</p>

<p>Smooch: The TV personality enjoyed a leisurely walk with her beau on Wednesday and they shared a passionate kiss as they continue to celebrate their recent engagement</p>

<p>Overwhelmed with emotion, the star joked about her three previous marriages before local police ordered the group to turn down the music at their 'loud' celebration.</p>

<p>'Are you mad? Are you sure? You know my track record right? I can't believe it', the mother-of-five said in reference to her tumultuous romance history.</p>

<p>Kerry married Westlife's Brian McFadden, 40, in 2002, but he filed for divorce in 2004 and embarked on a seven-year relationship with Australian singer Delta Goodrem shortly after.</p>

<p>The former couple's divorce was finalised in 2006, before the mother-of-five went on to tie the knot to taxi driver Mark Croft, 49, on Valentine's Day in 2007.</p>

<p>Outfit: Kerry cut a casual figure for the outing, donning a blue hoodie with matching tracksuit bottoms and a pair of multicoloured trainers</p>

<p>They split just two years later, and Kerry was married to George Kay from 2014 until 2017, who sadly died from an overdose last year aged 39.</p>

<p>She raises children Molly, 18, and Lilly-Sue, 17, with Brian, while she shares Heidi, 13, and Max, 12, with second spouse Mark and had Dylan-Jorge, six, with former sports star George.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Kerry and Ryan shared more details of their romantic Spanish engagement. </p>

<p>Appearing on Loose Women, the television personality, who has been married three times, gave her first TV interview since their shock announcement.</p>

<p>'I can still pull 'em!' Kerry previously shared the moment her boyfriend of two years Ryan proposed in Spain ahead of her 40th birthday</p>

<p>Speaking about telling her brood before getting down on one knee, Ryan explained: 'I thought it was the right thing to do.</p>

<p>'Everyone was excited, everyone was on board. It was lovely in that respect. I went to pick the ring with DJ and Heidi. I think Max was asleep at the time.'</p>

<p>Kerry said she couldn't believe DJ didn't tell her. 'For a six year old, she did really well. Crafty that one, I'll watch out for her!' she laughed.</p>

<p>Carol McGiffin then asked Ryan what he would have done if the kids had said no and Ryan revealed: 'If it was the youngest three, I would have brainwashed them with a McDonald's, the older two, harder work.</p>

<p>Wedding bells: Earlier this month, Kerry and Ryan shared more details of their romantic Spanish engagement as they appeared on Loose Women</p>

<p>'But yeah, I don't know really. I get along so well with them all so I kind of knew it was going to work… I'm really happy about it.'</p>

<p>Discussing why this marriage will be different, Kerry said: 'Before, it's always been about a wedding, I don't want a wedding, I want a marriage. Ryan's my partner, my life partner. I feel like this is how it should have been the first time and second… and third time around!</p>

<p>'The past is the past. Just because I've been married and divorced and I've got five kids with three dads, doesn't mean I don't deserve to be happy… I'm really happy and I'm in love.' </p>

<p>Sweet: The fitness guru proposed to Kerry last month during a holiday in Spain, with the blessing of her five children - Molly, 18, Lilly, 17, Heidi, 13, Max, 12, and DJ, six</p>

<p>In an interview with New Magazine, the couple hinted they could well tie the knot in a Las Vegas wedding.</p>

<p>Showing his apparent aversion to lavish nuptials, Ryan said: 'To me, weddings have always been overrated. I've never been a fan of the big, white wedding.</p>

<p>'I always knew if I was going to do it, I'd want to hop on a plane and do it in Vegas in a chilled-out way.'</p>

<p>Exciting: For Kerry, this will be her fourth marriage. She was previously married to Brian McFadden, 40, Mark Croft, 49, and late ex-husband George Kay</p>
