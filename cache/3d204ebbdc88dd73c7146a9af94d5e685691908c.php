<p>At the start of June, the former Big Brother winner admitted that she was still in love with her ex, after he moved back into her home during the COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

<p>But the Bristolian has now told new! magazine of Terry: 'He's moved out now. I'm choosing to do it on my own for a little bit at the moment. My sisters help, I'm very lucky. I want to put all my efforts into being a mum.'</p>

<p>The bubbly TV personality also went on to share her ambitions for her sole offspring, saying: 'I want Reg to grow into something amazing, like a space engineer, something like that. I want him to excel.'</p>

<p>Josie and Terry initially went their separate ways just four months after Reggie was born, with the star admitting that the pair 'never got on'.</p>

<p>However, her words were far more glowing in June, when she made appearance on ITV's Loose Women ahead of Terry moving out. </p>

<p>Casual: Carrying a black bag, Josie kept her look casual for the day as she also sported a pair of matching trainers</p>

<p>She said of her complicated relationship with her ex: 'He is one of those people you can't live with you can't live without. Terry is asthmatic, so we waited for three weeks. I couldn't take Reggie to the supermarket anymore so he moved in.'</p>

<p>On how they were coping with residing under the same roof, the reality star said: 'We have never got on so well.'</p>

<p>When asked whether she believed there was a chance they could rekindle their romance, she replied: 'We still stay in separate rooms but yeah, I love him to bits.</p>

<p>'When there is a pandemic you realise the little things are so trivial. The big things are important. What we used to argue about seems so trivial, so unimportant.'</p>

<p>'Who knows, I hope so,' the media personality said on whether the pair would continue to live with each other once the restrictions were lifted.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I really hope so. Seeing him and Reggie together is golden. It is so lovely. To see a man and his son is so special.</p>

<p>Reunited: In July, Josie revealed that her former partner Terry has moved out of her home once again, after he reentered the lives of her and their 23-month-old son Reggie</p>

<p>'They are obsessed with each-other. I have been shut up! I was the golden girl, now I am shut out.'</p>

<p>Josie and Terry, who has never been photographed out in public with the star, decided to call it quits last January after a series of arguments.</p>

<p>She said last month: 'We had a great big falling out because he's got OCD and I had too many shoes in the hallway. But now when people are struggling to breath, you just think "what a stupid thing to argue about!"'</p>

<p>At the time, Josie admitted that while they were getting on well, she wasn't sure about wanting to reignite a romance with her ex - but she didn't rule it out.</p>

<p> Breakup: Josie and Terry decided to call it quits last January after a series of arguments but the TV presenter now feels that many of them were petty</p>

<p>She said: 'We're still in separate rooms and taking things one step at a time... I need him to realise where it all went wrong and where we've got to put things right.'</p>

<p>Josie added that she is not the 'innocent one', insisting that both of them have things they need to work on.</p>

<p>She admitted that she initially felt unsupported by Terry when their son was born, saying he was not good with Reggie when he was a baby.</p>

<p>The star joked she had since felt left out by the father and son's growing bond, saying Reggie now prefers his father to her.</p>

<p>She said: 'He's moved out now. I'm choosing to do it on my own for a little bit at the moment. My sisters help, I'm very lucky. I want to put all my efforts into being a mum'</p>
