<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new government-funded sex-ed toolkit is encouraging schools to get children as young as 13 to discuss explicit sexual acts based on the roll of a dice - but this has led to concerns that girls may be sexualised at a young age.</p>

<p>The resource includes a game where children roll a dice featuring body parts such as 'penis' and 'hand and fingers' twice and are then encouraged to discuss the potential sexual acts carried out between them, The Times reports.   </p>

<p>The toolkit, produced by the LGBT+ charity the Proud Trust, itself tells teachers to hold their nerve because some of the combinations 'might seem impossible' for children to talk about.</p>

<p>Tanya Carter, a spokeswoman for Safe Schools Alliance, told The Times: 'This 'resource' clearly breaches safeguarding. The tampon tax should be used to educate girls on their rights — not prematurely sexualise them.'</p>

<p>The Proud Trust's Sexuality aGender v2 toolkit (pictured) was launched with funding from the Tampon Tax Fund through the Office for Civil Society. It features a dice game that encourages children as young as 13 to talk about intimate sexual acts</p>

<p>The Proud Trust describe themselves as a 'life saving and life enhancing organisation that helps LGBT+ young people empower themselves'.</p>

<p>They do this by offering training and resources to educate people about gender, sexuality and LGBT+ issues.</p>

<p>They are based at the LGBT+ Centre for Manchester and help organise national and local youth network groups. </p>

<p>The Trust say their name is intended to reflect their aspiration that every young person can be proud of their identity, without fear or shame. </p>

<p>She said that when teaching relationship and sexual education (RSE), teachers also need to remember that some children will have been victims of sexual abuse and may find the lessons traumatising.</p>

<p>The sex-ed toolkit was launched with funding from the Tampon Tax Fund through the Office for Civil Society. </p>

<p>The Proud Trust was awarded £99,960 in 2017 for their Sexualty aGender project and this latest 'v2' toolkit has been developed using some of these funds. </p>

<p>The MP for Thurrock, Jackie Doyle-Price said that she fully supports the introduction of RSE into schools and 'firmly' believes that it would empower girls to take greater control over their bodies.</p>

<p>However, on the subject of the Proud Trust toolkit she said: 'It is with horror that I see materials being produced which do the exact opposite. Schools should be teaching about mutual respect and consent and safe sex.' </p>

<p>Tory peer Baroness Nicholson of Winterbourne has even written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson about similar courses, saying that it is unsafe to abdicate responsibility for RSE to teachers who then abdicate it to outside groups. </p>

<p>The toolkit itself tells teachers to hold their nerve because some of the combinations 'might seem impossible' for children to talk about (stock image)</p>

<p>The Proud Trust describe themselves as a 'life saving and life enhancing organisation that helps LGBT+ young people empower themselves'. </p>

<p>On their website, the toolkit is outlined as 'a fun, interactive, engaging and inclusive sexual health toolkit, for use in secondary schools, colleges and other youth settings.'</p>

<p>The trust says that the four-lesson plan inside the kit helps meet statutory requirements to deliver LGBT+ inclusive RSE and that it helps meet the needs of all students.</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached The Proud Trust for comment. </p>

<p>The purpose of the Tampon Tax Fund is to allocate the funds generated from the VAT on sanitary products to front line projects that directly improve the lives of disadvantaged women and girls. </p>

<p>The generated funds have been re-distributed by the Government to women's charities since 2015.</p>

<p>The Office for Civil Society, which is part of the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) runs and manages the fund.</p>

<p>However, following from on from Brexit, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced earlier this year that the Tampon Tax will be abolished by January 2021.</p>

<p>The removal of tax on sanitary products could save women almost £40 each in their lifetime.</p>
