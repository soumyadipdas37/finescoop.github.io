<p>Heartbreaking: On Saturday, Jimmy Barnes , 64, (pictured) recalled the devastating time he came face-to-face with a man who had taken his own life in a parking lot - a moment which went on to haunt him throughout his life</p>

<p>'I remember I was downstairs for an hour sitting with him, waiting for an ambulance to come. I didn't want to leave him alone in this pool of blood,' the Cold Chisel singer said.</p>

<p>'I just sat there with him thinking 'How could you do this? Why did you do this?' It was a bit of me talking to myself in a way.'</p>

<p>Moments before, Jimmy said he had stood on his own balcony wrestling with his own troubled thoughts about suicide.</p>

<p>Honest: Jimmy made the heartbreaking revelation in his new book, titled Killing Time</p>

<p>And it wasn't the first time, he admits.  </p>

<p>Jimmy added that following the death of AC/DC's Bon Scott in  1980, he had found himself contemplating his life as he drank a bottle of vodka on the edge of ocean cliff The Gap in Sydney. </p>

<p>'I had to move away because it started to be enticing, you know, thinking of a way out,' he added.</p>

<p>In 2017, Jimmy made the admission that he attempted suicide in his hotel room in 2012 in his book, Working Class Man. </p>

<p>He wrote that he woke up in his large hotel suite - where he was staying with wife Jane - not remembering that he tried to take his own life.</p>

<p>Jimmy said that he attempted suicide after drinking his hotel minibar dry.</p>

<p>'Tied around the clothes rail is the dressing gown cord, just where I must have left it,' Jimmy wrote in the book.</p>

<p>'The rail, the cord and me with the cord around my neck waiting to die. But I didn't. It's not that easy to die, apparently,' he wrote.</p>

<p>In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, the former Cold Chisel star said telling his wife Jane about the incident made him turn his life around for good.</p>

<p>He and Jane have been married since 1981.</p>

<p>Jimmy believes his suicide attempt was a 'subconscious thing' and came after years of battling demons from his childhood to his addictions.</p>

<p>The Scottish-born star said he soon found a therapist to help him.</p>
