<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A war has broken out in a Cornish seaside town as locals clash with 'scruffy' street traders who do hair braids and henna tattoos. </p>

<p>The hair and ink artists have been plying their trade near the harbour of Padstow in Cornwall for decades to capture tourism income.</p>

<p>But locals in the upmarket resort - known as Padstein for the influence of celebrity chef Rick Stein - are demanding they are booted out as they are not in keeping with the surroundings.</p>

<p>The spat has spiralled to include local Conservative MP Scott Mann, who has raised the issue in parliament.</p>

<p>Hair and ink artists (pictured: Cher Ricard and Natasha Rowley) have been plying their trade near the harbour of Padstow in Cornwall for decades to capture tourism income</p>

<p>A war has broken out amongst the Cornish locals and the traders, who say a 'vigilante hate group' has launched a targeted campaign against them</p>

<p>Since lockdown was lifted, several of the hair braiders claim they are now being harassed and verbally abused on a regular basis.</p>

<p>They have even labelled a section of the local community a 'vigilante hate group' for what they described as a sustained and targeted campaign.</p>

<p>The divide has now reached an all-time high and has even led to calls from MP Mr Mann for the traders to be removed.</p>

<p>He described them this week as 'so-called businesses' but several of the traders have responded calling for a truce and a better understanding of what they do.</p>

<p>During the recent staycation boom, they also claim they have been more popular than ever with tourists.</p>

<p>Tourists have flocked to seaside towns like Padstow, where celebrity chef Rick Stein runs The Seafood restaurant, Rick Stein's Seafood Bar and Fishmongers, and Rick Stein's Café.</p>

<p>Healso runs a fish and chip shop in the town. </p>

<p>The upmarket Cornish town of Padstow (pictured) is known as 'Padstein' for the influence of celebrity chef Rick Stein who runs a restaurant in the area</p>

<p>And despite claiming to bring further money and footfall into the town, the traders claim a 'hateful' closed facebook group has been plotting ways to remove them altogether.</p>

<p>Natasha Rowley, 47, said they have consistently proved they had done nothing wrong.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've been doing this for 23 years and 11 years in Padstow and we have always had some animosity from a few locals.  </p>

<p>'They think we are not legitimate traders and not very educated. In the past there has been a bit of moaning and this and that.</p>

<p>Natasha Rowley, 47, pictured while working at Padstow harbour, said the traders have faced abuse despite 'consistently proving they had done nothing wrong'</p>

<p>Some traders said they believe the battle with the locals is founded on a fear that they are not insured or registered with HMRC</p>

<p>'But with Covid things have really turned nasty. They don't understand we are insured the same way as hairdressers. </p>

<p>'They have been coming up and down the street shouting and swearing.</p>

<p>'One lady was given such a horrible amount of abuse first thing in the morning she was reduced to tears. </p>

<p>'This is nothing more than bullying and harassment. It has really affected some of us.</p>

<p>The spat has escalated to involve local MP Scott Mann (pictured), the Conservative MP for north Cornwall</p>

<p>'It is by no means everyone, but there is a small percentage of Padstow that operate like this. </p>

<p>'They have an issue with us and seem to have some influence within the town council that creates problems.</p>

<p>'There could be some snobbery, but I think it is more that they are just not educated.'</p>

<p>Another hair braider Cher Ricard, also 47, said: 'They are totally uneducated and just don't think we are legitimate. </p>

<p>'They wrongly think we are not insured or registered with HMRC but we are here in all weathers, 60-70 hours a week, providing a valuable service.</p>

<p>'They seem to think we are stealing money from them.</p>

<p>'People say they are worried about chain stores, but we create a vibrancy and a holiday memory for visitors that they keep coming back to.</p>

<p>'We have been used to people saying nasty things on social media but we haven't suffered this level of verbal abuse until this year. It was after coronavirus it really accelerated.</p>

<p>'The MP has even tried to take the issue to parliament and get us shut down.</p>

<p>'Every year we receive so much vitriol from a Padstow residents vigilante hate group.</p>

<p>The traders claimed they bring 'a vibrancy' to the popular Cornish holiday spot (pictured above) and a 'holiday memory' for visitors that they keep coming back to</p>

<p>'The few shops and residents that show us any kindness get pressured so badly they end up forced to refuse us the simple use of a toilet for example.</p>

<p>'We have ignored the threats and petty school room attitudes for ten years but with Covid things have turned really nasty and need to stop.'</p>

<p>Natasha added: 'We have put up with this for years but we just want it to end.</p>

<p>'The tourists love us but we know there is a nasty element in Padstow that has a problem with us. </p>

<p>'Some of these are influential people and the hardest thing is seeing our friends being bullied and harassed.</p>

<p>The Cornish town is nicknamed 'Padstein' after famous chef Rick Stein (pictured) who has a fish restaurant in the town</p>

<p>'We should be part of people's holiday but they are just spreading hate. They are always shouting aggressively at us and being nasty. </p>

<p>'It is constant and they will probably not stop until we go. But we are not going anywhere.</p>

<p>'It is the behavior of nasty school bullies.</p>

<p>'The tourists don't see us as an eyesore. They see us as colourful and vibrant. </p>

<p>'But coronavirus has seen some locals vent their frustrations a lot more and things have got a bit out of hand.'</p>

<p>'People come to Padstow because of what we do. It is a place most know for a celebrity chef, but is also a place known for hair braiding.</p>

<p>'But the locals like to swear at us. We have been called an eyesore and accused of not paying tax or using card machines.</p>

<p>'They just don't think we contribute to society in a positive way but they just see what they want to see. </p>

<p>'All we ask is for a truce and for them to take a step back and really see what we do.'</p>

<p>Scott Mann MP confirmed he had raised the issue of the street traders in parliament and said he was still working to try to find a way to move them on.</p>

<p>He said: 'We have been working with all the stakeholders in Padstow on this issue. It can never be right that these so-called "businesses" can trade from the quay without paying rates whilst disrupting businesses working in a legitimate way.</p>

<p>Cher Ricard who runs Cher's Funky Faces at the Padstow harbour offers a hair braiding service</p>

<p>'Whilst local solutions are being worked on to remove them from working around the quay, there needs to be a change in the licensing laws to ensure henna tattooists and hair braiders are classified as street traders and treated like others.</p>

<p>'Any commercial enterprise whether it is a street trader or fixed premises should be subject to the same rules, regulations and taxation.'  </p>

<p>Cornwall Council said: 'Due to the fact hair braiders have no fixed base of work, they are not governed by street trading laws and therefore do not need to obtain a formal consent from Cornwall Council.</p>

<p>'The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE) has enforcing powers on this type of work and police could use enforcement powers if operators were causing an obstruction.' </p>
