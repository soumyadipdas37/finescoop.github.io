<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sadiq Khan's own council has scrapped his £33million green traffic scheme over concerns it is causing 'chaos', blocking emergency vehicles and generating 'excessive levels of pollution'. </p>

<p>Wandsworth Council obtained funding from Transport for London (TfL) to launch trials of Low Traffic Neighbourhoods last month, but announced today it has suspended the project. </p>

<p>A statement from the Wandsworth Conservatives claimed the scheme, which prohibited vehicles from using certain roads, is 'not wanted' and the 'adverse effects' are now clear.  </p>

<p>The group issued a comment yesterday confirming it had decided to 'urgently review' the Low Traffic Neighbourhoods in Tooting which 'were imposed upon the Council by TfL.'</p>

<p>'Traffic calming measures have to work for residents. And if they don't the Council stands ready to change them,' they added.</p>

<p>Today, the group claimed the trials were harmed by TfL's changes to a major road through Tooting.</p>

<p>TfL, chaired by Mr Khan, has implemented cycle lane segregation and banned turns at several junctions on the A24 as part of a £33million scheme to promote alternative forms of travel in London as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown.   </p>

<p>Sadiq Khan's own council has scrapped his £33million green traffic scheme over concerns it is causing 'chaos', blocking emergency vehicles and generating 'excessive levels of pollution'.  Pictured: Cyclists on the A24 (Tooting High Street) earlier today</p>

<p>The trial measures, introduced across four neighbourhoods of Tooting - Beechcroft, Tooting Commons, Graveney and Fishponds - were implemented on August 17 to make the area more bike and pedestrian friendly while deterring rat run traffic</p>

<p>The trial measures, introduced across four neighbourhoods of Tooting - Beechcroft, Tooting Commons, Graveney and Fishponds - were put in place on August 17.     </p>

<p>'The Mayor's A24 changes are causing traffic chaos across Tooting - causing excessive amounts of pollution,' the Wandsworth Conservatives said.</p>

<p>John Locker, the council's cabinet member for strategic planning and transportation, added: 'It is clear that the LTNs are not delivering the benefits we want to see.</p>

<p>'In fact it looks like the combination of changes in areas like Tooting, where TfL are making changes to the main high road, are unfortunately having the opposite effect.</p>

<p>'That is why we have taken the difficult decision to pause and rethink about how we can achieve our objective of delivering healthier, safer streets.'</p>

<p>But Alice Ridley, of Campaign for Better Transport, insisted Low Traffic Neighbourhoods 'make streets safer' and benefit people's health and environment.  </p>

<p>'Councils should not allow a vocal minority to stop them from improving local transport and protecting their residents,' she said. </p>

<p>'The misery of air pollution and rat-running on residential streets needs to become a thing of the past.' </p>

<p>TfL's administration of investment in LTNs follows a Government scheme to promote cycling and walking amid concerns that the coronavirus pandemic could led to an increase in road congestion.  </p>

<p>AA president Edmund King has written to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warning that many of the projects which were introduced across the country without consultation are 'regrettably adding to congestion and poorer air quality rather than improving them'.</p>

<p>The changes surrounding the A24 are part of a £33million scheme to promote alternative forms of travel in an attempt to get London moving again as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Pictured: Traffic on Tooting High Street next to an empty pop-up cycle lane</p>

<p>He added: 'Unfortunately, the lack of consultation is leading to growing levels of dissatisfaction and frustration across many road users, including some emergency services.'</p>

<p>Mr King called on the Cabinet minister to consider reintroducing 'some form of streamlined consultation' to ensure 'councils spend the money wisely'. </p>

<p>It comes amid reports that pop-up cycle lanes that were set up as part of the wider £225million plan to get Britain moving are lying empty while traffic is squeezing on to narrowed streets.</p>

<p>MailOnline visited some of the key cycle lanes across the country at the height of the rush hour to gauge how busy they are, only to find them chronically under-used with cyclists criticising them as well as motorists.</p>

<p>Sadiq Khan (pictured), who was born in Tooting, remains a resident of the area</p>

<p>Our research in London shows that on the Euston Road just 7 cyclists used the designated lane over a 15-minute period.</p>

<p>Meanwhile 420 cars fought their way through traffic while in Park Lane, Mayfair, just 21 cyclists used the lane as 400 cars battled past.</p>

<p>In Liverpool, on busy arterial route West Derby Road, just 2 cyclists used a pop-up cycle lane during a 15-minute period in rush hour, compared with 300 cars.</p>

<p>Motorists voiced their fury at the delay to their journeys as they sat stationary next to the vacant bike lanes, whilst cyclists complained that the idling, gridlocked traffic was making air pollution worse.</p>

<p>MailOnline's findings came as new research released yesterday shows congestion levels in London are now higher than they were before Britain went into lockdown in March – and have risen by 25 per cent in just a week.</p>

<p>The new cycle lanes form part of Transport for London's government funded Street Space scheme, which is designed to encourage people to walk or cycle to work and school as an alternative to public transport following the easing of lockdown.</p>

<p>In Manchester, where a similar scheme was set up, a pop-up lane lasted just 48 hours before it was removed by the council after outrage from drivers.</p>

<p>In the capital, the busy Euston road - one of the main arterial routes cutting through the middle of London - has been reduced to a single lane to accommodate the cycle lane, resulting in gridlock misery. </p>

<p>Richie Clea, who drives around London fixing gas pipelines and was stuck in traffic along Euston Road told MailOnline: 'Driving in London is getting worse. There are too many cycle lanes that nobody is using.</p>

<p>'Since the end of the lockdown my journey times have trebled. It's a nightmare.' </p>

<p>Traffic was busy on Park Lane in London, while the cycle lane remained relatively empty when this photograph was taken on September 9</p>

<p>Similarly, the pop-up cycle lane on West Derby Road, in Liverpool, was empty yesterday while cars queued up bumper-to-bumper in traffic</p>

<p>7.30-7.45am: 100 bikes</p>

<p>Traffic completely gridlocked</p>

<p>Cyclist Graham Robinson added: 'The cycling lanes schemes has not been properly thought out. </p>

<p>'It's led to more traffic congestion and the air quality is getting worse. </p>

<p>'It's quite common to be cycling along and get hit by a big cloud of car or bus smoke. </p>

<p>'Cycling in London is not for the faint hearted.'</p>

<p>George Peach, who cycles almost 12 miles each day to his job in advertising said: 'They need to improve the roads not narrow them. </p>

<p>'Traffic fumes are getting worse and where there are no cycle lanes, you're fighting motorists for space. </p>

<p>'This scheme is meant to get us healthy, but my worry is that you could be causing more damage because there's more pollution.'</p>

<p>During a 15-minute period at Park Lane, another of London's major roads, 400 cars were counted compared with only 22 cyclists.</p>

<p>Builder Norman Adams said the designated cycle lanes being introduced by Transport for London had 'ruined London'.</p>

<p>He fumed: 'What is the point? London mayor Sadiq Khan keeps banging on about air quality, but how does that stack up when cars are sat for ages with engines idling. </p>

<p>'He just hates motorists and wants to make them pay.'</p>

<p>What is supposed to be one of the major cycling lane intersections at the junction of York Way and Goods Way, close to Kings Cross Station, 40 bicycles were counted over 15 minutes but that was dwarfed by 360 cars and vans that went past at the same time.</p>

<p>Further out from central London, things were not much better with traffic piling up alongside empty cycle lanes with some cyclists opting not to use them at all. </p>

<p>In Hammersmith, West London, MailOnline counted 18 cyclists with more than half not even using the lane, opting for the road while two others hogged the pavement. </p>

<p>At the same time, 280 cars were jostling for space along a busy main road.</p>

<p>Just past rush hour in Ealing, West London, 45 cars were counted going past in a quarter of an hour but only three cyclists using the dedicated lane and one on the road. </p>

<p>Ironically, the local council has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of Street Space funding and recently received almost £440,000 for cycling provisions. </p>

<p>The only location to buck the trend was Tooting in South London, where 100 bicycles were counted in the bike lane. </p>

<p>MailOnline's findings came as new research shows congestion levels in London are now higher than they were before Britain went into lockdown in March – and have risen by 25% in just a week. Pictured: A pop-up cycle lane on Totting High Street</p>

<p>Similar schemes are being undertaken across the country, including in Liverpool where there is a pop-up cycle lane on West Derby Road</p>

<p>The road is a major arterial route to and from the city centre and is always busy with traffic, particularly around rush hours</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the number of cars going past could not be calculated because they were all stuck in horrific gridlocked traffic.</p>

<p>Across the country, councils have started receiving funding from a total £225 million pot of money to spend on cycling, to get people fit and out of their cars as part of the war on coronavirus.</p>

<p>The outcome however is that it is not just drivers in London who have been suffering.</p>

<p>A pop-up cycle lane was scrapped in Greater Manchester within 48 hours after huge uproar from motorists over long queues. </p>

<p>By Stewart Whittingham for MailOnline</p>

<p>8.30-8.45am Tuebrook, Liverpool - Cyclists – 2 / Cars - 300</p>

<p>Frustrated drivers had to queue bumper-to-bumper during rush hour in Liverpool as a pop-up cycle lane lay empty next to them. </p>

<p>The two lanes of the A5049 in Tuebrook leading into the city had been reduced to one for cars with the inside lane cordoned off for cyclists.</p>

<p>During the height of rush-hour at 8.30am, Mailonline saw just two cyclists using it over a 15 minute time period – compared to nearly 300 cars crawling through Rocky Lane leading to West Derby Road. </p>

<p>During the height of rush-hour at 8.30am, Mailonline saw just two cyclists using it over a 15 minute time period – compared to nearly 300 cars crawling through Rocky Lane leading to West Derby Road</p>

<p>The traffic was travelling at around 10mph but got clogged for a few minutes as they had to wait at traffic lights. </p>

<p>The roads surrounding it were also chock-a-block with cars with many exasperated drivers honking their horns. Van driver Mark Roberts, 45, said: 'This is madness - no-one's using the cycle lanes and the roads are blocked. 'This is stopping people getting to work. 'I've been stuck in a queue for half an hour before. It needs sorting.' </p>

<p>Local resident Peter Williams, 54, said: 'It's chaos with everyone stuck in traffic. 'It seems so over the top to give half the road to cyclist when there's just a handful using it. 'I hate driving along it now.' Even cyclists expressed surprise at the measures. University technician Tony Lanigan, 62, was riding three miles from his home to work.</p>

<p>He said: 'Sometimes I'm the only one on it. I do feel a bit embarrassed with the drivers not moving. </p>

<p>'I mean it's great for me, but it does seem a bit over the top to give us a full lane.'</p>

<p>A pop-up cycle lane was scrapped in Greater Manchester within 48 hours after huge uproar from motorists over long queues.</p>

<p>The lane was removed in June by Trafford Council on the A56 between Sale and Altrincham after drivers complained of being stuck in a queue for an hour to travel just two miles.</p>

<p>Bollards had been put down to give cyclists one lane of the road.</p>

<p>Businessman Mike Jones, 32, said: 'It was bonkers. Once I only saw one cyclist. 'People just weren't moving. 'Everyone was getting angry and frustrated.' Trafford Council bowed to public anger and removed it in late June.</p>

<p>The lane was removed in June by Trafford Council on the A56 between Sale and Altrincham after drivers complained of being stuck in a queue for an hour to travel just two miles</p>

<p>Councillor Nathan Evans said: 'We certainly need safe cycle routes but at a time when we need maximum opportunity for access to work and limited use of public transport, simply halving the main route into Manchester, without proper consideration or any consultation with local residents, is the wrong decision.'</p>

<p>Council leader Andrew Western said: 'We had followed government advice to re-designate road space for walking and cycling and the scheme initially progressed with minimal disruption to traffic. </p>

<p>'This changed so we and acted accordingly.' </p>

<p>There is still a cycle lane on the rest of the A56 north going into the city centre.</p>

<p>In London, a Tfl spokesman defended the Street Space scheme as a way of providing a healthy alternative to using public transport.</p>

<p>'We need to urgently reconsider use of Street Space to provide safe and appealing spaces to walk and cycle as an alternative to car use in the context of reduced capacity on the public transport network.</p>

<p>'Suppressing motorised traffic while allowing essential journeys to take place is key to ensuring we manage our road and public transport networks to maximise our ability to keep people moving safely.'   </p>

<p>It comes as congestion data from yesterday showed how traffic levels soared past pre-Covid Britain figures.</p>

<p>Journeys were blighted by roadworks, full buses, bridge closures and new cycle schemes as the capital struggled to readjust to the surge in travellers. </p>

<p>There has been growing fury over the number of trains on the tracks and lack of social distancing on public transport.</p>

<p>Congestion levels for London showed vehicles on the road rocket from 47 per cent last week to 72 per cent at 8am yesterday - up by 25 percentage points.  </p>

<p>The figures, from TomTom's traffic index, also suggested drivers soared past last year's pre-Covid average of 65 per cent.</p>

<p>But commuters were hit with delays as the capital was blighted by 25 roadworks inside the M25.</p>

<p>The A1, from north London into the city centre, faced lane restrictions and phased closures due to the Tottenham Hale regeneration scheme. </p>

<p>People travelling over the Thames faced further chaos as London Bridge remains closed to cars, Vauxhall Bridge (pictured) is shut until November and Hammersmith Bridge is fenced off indefinitely</p>

<p>Fuming residents whose street was blocked off so it could be turned into a Covid-safe bike path have been left stunned after signs they put up in protest were removed  by 'jobsworth' council officials - who feared they could injure cyclists.</p>

<p>The wooden signs were put up by disgruntled locals in Poole, Dorset, after their entire street was blocked off by large planters to encourage pedestrians and cyclists to use it - while remaining socially distanced.</p>

<p>But frustrated residents on Churchfield Road say they are now forced to take a 'massive detour' in order to park outside their own homes.</p>

<p>Mrs Hewitt, 61, has accused Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch (BCP) Council of 'making up excuses'.</p>

<p>She said: 'It's absolutely ridiculous. They have put the bollards in place yet it is my signs that were of mortal danger to cyclists.</p>

<p>BCP Council was awarded around £1.4million from the government for its active travel scheme.</p>

<p>Those living in the wealthy west also saw congestion around Knightsbridge near Hyde Park because of temporary traffic signals on the A4.</p>

<p>People travelling over the Thames faced further chaos as London Bridge remains closed to cars, Vauxhall Bridge is shut until November and Hammersmith Bridge is fenced off indefinitely.</p>

<p>For those taking public transport, there were reports of buses skipping stops as they already had their 30-person Covid capacity.</p>

<p>But Transport for London figures show numbers were back up on the Tube, with 760,000 journeys made by 10am.</p>

<p>It is up 16 per cent on the same day last week, but still represents just 33 per cent of the demand on the same day last year.</p>

<p>London's new 'Covid friendly' cycle lanes also appeared to to have come at the worst possible time as works led to further traffic.</p>

<p>Yesterday footage emerged of a fire engine stuck in a road block caused by construction on the so-called Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTN) in Ferndale.</p>

<p>The video shows the blue-lit emergency vehicle wedged between a wooden planter and a parked white car in Ferndale, south London.</p>

<p>As firefighters ditch the vehicle and make the short walk to the nearby incident, one angry resident can be heard raging against the scheme, saying: 'You are trying to say this is good for us?'</p>

<p>The video comes as residents across Britain continue to slam the implementation of so-called Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTN) - which have been used by councils to wage war on motorists under the government's controversial Active Travel project.</p>

<p>The scheme, which has been introduced to allow for social distancing amid on footpaths and cycle during the coronavirus pandemic, has caused controversy as many believe it is being implemented to 'punish' motorists. </p>

<p>Angry residents in several London boroughs are said to be planning protests this weekend against LTN schemes in their areas. </p>

<p>The video shows the blue-lit emergency vehicle appearing to be wedged between a wooden planter and a parked white vehicle in Ferndale, south London</p>

<p>The Low Traffic Neighbour (LTN) area for the Ferndale area, covered by Lambeth Council, covers the area around Lambeth Hospital </p>

<p>Abi Babalola, 40, says her 10 minute school run now takes more than 30 minutes due to her having to weave her way around the streets of Ferndale</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one resident, who lives in the area where the video of the fire engine getting stuck was filmed, hit out the LTN area in Ferndale.</p>

<p>Abi Babalola, 40, says her 10 minute school run now takes more than 30 minutes due to her having to weave her way around the streets of Brixton - even passing near to her home 'a number of times' in the process.</p>

<p>The stay-at-home mother-of-three, who has lived in the area for 30 years, claims councils are using Covid-19 as an excuse to clamp down on motorists, who she says are being 'discriminated against.'</p>

<p>She said: 'It's ridiculous. I have to pass my house numerous times and go round the back just to access the road I live on.</p>

<p>'I dread to think if the emergency services have to get to me or someone down my road.</p>

<p>'I've lived here for 30 years and we have never had a problem. This is causing a problem for lots of people.</p>

<p>'They are pushing people on to already busy roads. It's like a car park in rush hour.</p>

<p>The Government is spending £225 million on active travel measures across the country, most notably in London, Oxford, Manchester, Birmingham and York.</p>

<p>A major initiative launched by the Department for Transport in May set aside £225m for 'emergency active travel schemes for local authorities due to the pandemic'.</p>

<p>The department says the money will enable local authorities to produce 'new cycling and walking facilities' and its altered road and parking schemes will promote recovery.</p>

<p>However, Emergency Active Travel Fund money comes with a string attached. Councils must satisfy officials 'they have swift and meaningful plans to reallocate road space to cyclists and pedestrians (both groups rather than one or the other), including on strategic corridors.</p>

<p>Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council has closed the road to cars as part of the active travel scheme to encourage people to walk and cycle.</p>

<p>BCP Council was awarded around £1.4million from the government for the project.</p>

<p>'And not everyone can walk or cycle. I have three children and I do a big weekly shop. I can't carry that home.'</p>

<p>The London Fire Bridge (LFB) said the incident involving the stuck fire engine in Ferndale happened when firefighters were attending a person locked out of their home six doors down from where the fire engine was pictured. </p>

<p>A spokesperson said: 'There was no delay to our attendance and there was no damage to the fire engine or the parked cars.'</p>

<p>The spokesperson added the the brigade 'supports the LTN in order to assist the recovery from the pandemic and to promote active travel,' and that it is consulted by councils on any proposed road changes.</p>

<p>Lambeth Council meanwhile says the position of the planter, which was placed as part of the trial LTN scheme, was changed the day after the incident.</p>

<p>Cllr Claire Holland, Deputy Leader added: 'It is important to ensure those who do not have access to a car - around 60 per cent of Lambeth residents – aren't forced to walk or cycle on dangerous roads or forced to use public transport whilst the risk of transmission remains high.</p>

<p>'These projects aim to redress this balance, making it safer for everyone to walk and cycle, so that those without a car have genuine transport options whilst leaving our road clear for those that absolutely have to use them.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, commuters in the capital slammed the city's transport system, with some branding it 'an absolute joke' and called for Mayor Sadiq Khan to 'get a grip' of it.</p>

<p>One man tweeted: '<?php echo e('@'); ?>SadiqKhan get a grip of London. Life is becoming unbearable - traffic caused by roadworks &amp; bridges closed/heavily restricted.</p>

<p>'We try to go about daily lives as best as we can under current situation, I drive electric but might as well be in a big fat Range Rover.'</p>

<p>Another wrote 'London traffic is an absolute joke', while a woman added 'London traffic', with three angry emojis.</p>

<p>A male user posted: 'Nephew is a current London Police Officer, with him on Monday he told me they often have to abandon the vehicle when on emergency calls, as it's quicker to run, because of the traffic caused by the current street closures (which he and his colleagues call utter madness).' </p>

<p>One woman wrote: 'London traffic is madness.' A man added: 'Whoever is on control of the traffic light timing at London Wall/Moorgate, eastbound vehicles need more than 5 secs on green!! Q's back to Museum of London.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile traffic remained steady in other cities, with Manchester, Birmingham and Liverpool seeing meagre rises. </p>

<p>Manchester, which has some areas in local lockdown due to a spike in coronavirus cases, had congestion levels at 39 per cent - two percentage points up on last week.</p>

<p>Birmingham, which is teetering on the edge of having new restrictions brought in, also saw just a five per cent rise on last week's data.  </p>

<p>Liverpool followed the trend and saw a small increase in people on its roads at rush hour, with traffic up by five percentage points on the previous week. </p>

<p>Katie Taylor, Brixton, London</p>

<p>'I live on Shakespeare Road and have been on the wrong end of a newly imposed LTN implemented by the Lambeth council. </p>

<p>'We received less that one week's notice of the changes (as did Network Rail and many other local businesses which have now been detrimentally impacted by the scheme). </p>

<p>'The scheme continues to be extremely polarising and is causing HUGE levels of upset to many residents who are concerned about a wide ranging number of issues: Disability access, access for care workers, concern for local businesses, increased pollution on neighbouring road, impact on house prices on those who have been cut off from their own neighbourhoods, delivery services, Uber trips, additional journey times for work journeys, safety (Roads are now dead!) There are huge fractures emerging and a growing sense of hostility between different groups.</p>

<p>'We are now working on local movements like 'One Railton' and 'One Oval' to try to push our local councils to listen, but so far they are refusing to engage with us in a meaningful way.'</p>

<p>Samantha Cooray, Oval, London </p>

<p>'I live in the Oval and we were the first to be subjected to 'LTNs' in Lambeth in June with no notification or consultation (under 'Emergency Covid legislation).</p>

<p>'We are right on the congestion charge boundary too with 5 schools along the boundary roads.</p>

<p>Samantha Cooray says Clapham Road, Brixton Road and South Lambeth Road are all affected. Pictured left: Congestion on Landsdown Way. Pictured right: Traffic on Harleyford Road, Oval</p>

<p>'Self-employed, disabled, those with elderly relatives, local businesses all affected - all so a few wealthy residents can have their private (B road - Fentiman) on enclave. </p>

<p>'Clapham Road, Brixton Road and South Lambeth Road all connect Guy's and St Thomas', King's and George's hospitals and ambulances, the fire bridage and police are frequently stuck in displaced traffic.</p>

<p>'Those of us 'outside' the LTN are now breathing in lots more pollution, with no more people cycling in reality.'</p>

<p>Morgan Douglas, Bowes Park, London</p>

<p>'Enfield council have decide with pressure from cyclist lobby groups to close off access to the Bowes area so that we can only access our homes via the most congested roads in the UK - the A406 north circular.</p>

<p>'The scheme's masters openly admit that traffic on the main roads surrounding the are will increase.</p>

<p>These roads are the locations for our primary school, which already has some of the worst pollution measurements and even has its own measuring facility.</p>

<p>'We are on the border of TFL controlled roads, two councils and three voting wards and so no one really has any say so a proper area wide solution can not be sort as all the groups cants seem to sit down and find a solution.</p>

<p>'Many smaller roads are now taking the brunt off this ill-thought-out plan with stationary traffic.</p>

<p>'Today an ambulance was parked up at one of these barriers and the police chased someone up to the barrier for them to whizz through and leave the police banging their wheel in frustration.'</p>

<p>Sarah Johnson, Paulsgrove, Portsmouth </p>

<p>'After reading your story about the road closure in Poole it hit a nerve with what we are experiencing here in Paulsgrove, Portsmouth.</p>

<p>'The road in question is called Portsdown Road and is shared with both Fareham and Portsmouth City Council's but apparently is under Hampshire county council in regard to highways. </p>

<p>Sarah Johnson, who lives in Paulsgrove, Portsmouth, said Hampshire County Council is closing off Paulsgrove Road in Portsmouth</p>

<p>She says that residents were only give two days notice that the road would be closed under a new scheme to encourage more people to cycle and walk</p>

<p>'It has been decided by Hampshire to block Portsdown Road to cars as it will stop the spread of Covid-19 to pedestrians.</p>

<p>'They only told the residents on the Fareham side two days before the closure and ignored the Portsmouth residents completely, not even informing Portsmouth City Council.</p>

<p>'This road has a railway bridge over it and there is no pavement when walking under it.</p>

<p>However it is not exactly heaving with people I use the road regularly and barely see anyone else.'</p>

<p>Mike Turton, Liverpool</p>

<p>'My commute to work at the largest of the city's hospitals has had to change a number of times since I started work there in 2016. </p>

<p>'Work to widen the dual carriageway on Derby Road has been ongoing for over four years and is not even halfway completed, the Dock Road has been reduced by half to incorporate a large cycle lane and work has commenced on the main road into Liverpool city centre and is expected to last a couple of years.</p>

<p>'These were all main commuter routes in Liverpool which has forced the traffic onto inner roads.</p>

<p>'The local council In its wisdom has now reduced the large dual carriageway on Stanley Road, Bootle, down to one lane to allow for cycle lanes.</p>

<p>'Pre-Covid this route was nose to tail in both lanes for the rush hour traffic and this has now been reduced down to one lane which incorporates a right turn, all to accommodate cyclists. </p>

<p>'These are not areas where you would cycle for a gentle bit of exercise, they are commercial areas and major commuting routes.</p>

<p>'The pavements, particularly Stanley Road are wide enough to accommodate a car and are virtually empty as this is not a residential area, the cycle lane is also empty, as is the one on the dock road and the one or two cyclists we do see are still riding on the roads.</p>

<p>'For the small number of cyclists commuting to work through these areas could the council not have created a cycle lane with the wide pavement area? If these measures are inconveniencing motorists in this way, how on Earth are the emergency services supposed to get through?'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a local councillor named Steve Radford, who represents the Liberal party, has started a campaign to  'Scrap the West Derby Road Congestion Scheme'.</p>

<p>Cllr Steve Radford says a pop-up cycle lane scheme in West Derby Road in Liverpool is causing major traffic problems on the arterial route </p>

<p>Cllr Radford said: 'The West Derby Road is one of the major arterial roads into the city and, unlike others, does not have a rail link as an alternative to motor traffic</p>

<p>'We have sent in over 500 residents' and traders' statements against the pop-up cycle lane scheme. The online petition has exceeded 2,000 signatures.  </p>

<p>'Every day we have our local ambulance station and police cars blocked in, including on the feeder Road Lower Breck Road blocked and Millbank tailback.'  </p>

<p>Leanne Bell, Lee Green, London</p>

<p>'I am a Greenwich council resident, however across the road is Lewisham Council.</p>

<p>'Lewisham council have closed off so many road in the local area. The impact on the traffic now outside my home which is a main road (A20) is becoming unbearable.</p>

<p>'I live in a flat with no garden or outside space of my own.</p>

<p>'There is also a bus stop and traffic camera directly opposite my home which bring much more of the noise and traffic fumes into my living room.</p>

<p>'It seems so unfair that I live in a very small flat and the large homes with gardens opposite now also have the roads to do as they please!'</p>

<p>MANCHESTER: The city, which has some areas in local lockdown due to a spike in coronavirus cases, had congestion levels at 39 per cent - two percentage points up on last week</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM: The second city, which is teetering on the edge of having new restrictions brought in, also saw just a five per cent rise on last week's data</p>

<p>LIVERPOOL: The city saw a small increase in people on its roads at rush hour, with traffic up by five percentage points on the previous week</p>

<p>Plans for a train service between Blackpool and London have been scrapped because of Covid-19.</p>

<p>Rail chiefs at Grand Central said the proposed route was no longer viable due to economic uncertainty and changed travel patterns.</p>

<p>The firm's managing director, Richard McClean, said: 'So much effort has been put into these exciting plans to launch services between London and Blackpool that it is heartbreaking to have to abandon them at this point but the pandemic and its effect on our expansion plans have just proved too big an obstacle.</p>

<p>'Despite months of work to adjust our costs and monitor travel behaviour for signs of change it became more obvious to us that to invest in what is essentially a start-up enterprise in this climate was simply not feasible and therefore we reluctantly reached the very tough decision to cease the project permanently.'</p>

<p>The proposed expansion of Grand Central's services would have linked communities in Blackpool, Preston, Nuneaton and Milton Keynes directly to London Euston.</p>

<p>Offices had been set up in the Lancashire resort as part of the project with extra staff taken on, including drivers. </p>

<p>But smaller cities such as Nottingham and Sheffield saw congestion levels fall, suggesting fewer cars were on the road yesterday.</p>

<p>Both cities had a three per cent decline in traffic levels compared to last week's TomTom data. </p>

<p>It comes as new figures show demand for rail services has fallen despite people being encouraged to return to the workplace.</p>

<p>The estimated number of train journeys across Britain on Monday was 33 per cent of pre-coronavirus pandemic levels, Department for Transport (DfT) data shows. </p>

<p>This is the same figure recorded on three days last week and six percentage points lower than Monday August 24.</p>

<p>Timetables were ramped up to around 90 per cent of normal levels this week, with operators insisting their carriages are 'safe to travel in' and telling commuters they can 'travel with confidence'.</p>

<p>In late August, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps claimed it was safe for more people to go back to the workplace as there are 'limitations' to homeworking.</p>

<p>Speaking to LBC, he said: 'Our central message is pretty straightforward. We're saying to people 'it is now safe to return to work'.'</p>

<p>The DfT's data shows that other forms of public transport have seen an increase in demand.</p>

<p>On Monday, bus use outside London was at 54 per cent of pre-pandemic levels, compared with 49 per cent on the first working day of last week.</p>

<p>Over the same period, bus use within the capital rose from 54 per cent to 58 per cent, while London Underground use increased from 33 per cent to 34 per cent.</p>

<p>This suggests a higher proportion of workers with shorter commutes, conducted by bus or Tube, are returning to workplaces than rail commuters. </p>
