<p>Upset: James Corden provoked the rage of One Direction fans as he REFUSED to kidnap the group and make them reunite before sharing unseen Carpool Karaoke footage on Wednesday</p>

<p>One fan wrote: 'If James Corden doesn’t give us any content we will be cancelling the late late show.'</p>

<p>While another shared a picture of Louis looking emotional, and wrote: 'James Corden is once again proof, all men do is lie.'</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the show's producer Ben Winston teased the potential for them to share unseen footage of the group at a McDonald's Drive-Thru before deleting the tweet</p>

<p>Raging: Fans were notably unhappy with the turn of events, as they claimed they would 'cancel' the Late, Late Show if James and Ben didn't deliver on their promise</p>

<p>Heading out onto the show, James began his monologue by addressing the fact so many fans had requested that he kidnap One Direction.</p>

<p>He admitted: 'I make a point not to read the comments about myself of the show on social media, it's a little thing I call self care but after the past few months there is a trend online that I have frankly been unable to ignore.</p>

<p>'As you can see I've had thousands of comments on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, insisting that I kidnap One Direction, it's all my feed is. </p>

<p>'You know they've appeared willingly on the show, right? And I'm not going to brag but I do have their phone numbers. </p>

<p>Unprecedented: Heading out onto the show, James began his monologue by addressing the fact so many fans had requested that he kidnap One Direction</p>

<p>Joking around: James said, 'I just want to say this the more people ask me to kidnap the boys the less likely I am to do it, you're ruining the element of surprise'</p>

<p>Teasing fans, he continued: 'But maybe you're right, maybe it's easier to determine their respective locations, leave my family, fly to different countries all over the world during a pandemic, kidnap them and force them to sing Night Changes in my car.'</p>

<p>James then went on: 'Now I've asked our digital team in the show to look into it and on average the show has been getting over 300 YouTube comments per week about me kidnapping One Direction.</p>

<p>'I just want to say this the more people ask me to kidnap the boys the less likely I am to do it, you're ruining the element of surprise and surprise is a major factor when kidnapping someone. </p>

<p>'In the history of kidnapping I don't think any of them have originated from a fan account relentlessly suggesting that a crime take place, and it is a crime.'</p>

<p>Not happening: 'In the history of kidnapping I don't think any of them have originated from a fan account relentlessly suggesting that a crime take place, and it is a crime,' James added</p>

<p>Cut out: Keeping true to his word, James then shared a slew of unseen footage from when the band visited the show and during their Carpool Karaoke segment</p>

<p>After reading a number of amusing fan responses, he added: 'Nothing would give me more pleasure than getting One Direction back together.</p>

<p>'I love those boys with all of my heart but honestly I cannot commit a crime, i'm honoured you want me to be the person to bring them back together.'</p>

<p>Keeping true to his word, James then shared a slew of unseen footage from when the band visited the show and during their Carpool Karaoke segment.</p>

<p>In the cut scene, the group order an array of food from a McDonalds Drive-Thru, with Louis even giving back his chocolate milkshake after realising he didn't want it.</p>

<p>Snacking: In the cut scene, the group order an array of food from a McDonalds Drive-Thru</p>

<p>Order up! Louise asked for a sausage and egg sandwhich with hash browns and a milkshake</p>

<p>The group and James even did some synchronised dancing while in matching outfit for one rendition, while the presenter joked that the group would have to 'hold it in' if they wanted to go to the toilet.</p>

<p>In another segment, Harry, Liam, Louis, and Niall took part in a dodgeball match and had an amusing time on court while James acted as their coach. </p>

<p>Taking his job very seriously, James stripped down to a bath towel and pretended to join each member to the shower to help scrub their back after the match.</p>

<p>While one cut scene saw Louis pretend to be James' cat in a recreation of a classic Bond flick You Only Live Twice, but the singer ruined it when he quoted Blofeld by saying 'well, well, well', despite acting as the cat. </p>

<p>Helping out: James was seen giving the fast food to the group according to their orders</p>

<p>Not to his taste: Louis then gave back his chocolate milkshake after realising he didn't want it</p>

<p>Despite sharing the footage of the band together, some fans were unhappy with James for refusing to kidnap them and took to Twitter to share their displeasure.</p>

<p>Another added: 'JAMES SINCE YOU DON'T WANT TO KIDNAP THE BOYS HOW ABOUT YOU TRICK THEM INTO COMING ONTO THE SHOW FOR THE SAME NIGHT!! (sic).' </p>

<p>While one claimed: 'james corden telling us that he can't kidnap the boys is like our parents telling us the toothfairy isn't real.' </p>

<p>Do it: Despite sharing the footage of the band together, some fans were unhappy with James for refusing to kidnap them and took to Twitter to share their displeasure</p>
