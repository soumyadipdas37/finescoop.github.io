<p>James, who recently starred in the BBC drama The Trial Of Christine Keeler, has been hotly-tipped as the latest actor to play James Bond.</p>

<p>The Sun claimed bookmaker Ladbrokes has suspended betting on the star being the next man to portray the fictional secret agent.</p>

<p>Amid frenzied speculation about who will be the next to play Bond, with stars including Richard Madden and Idris Elba being linked with the role, a source told the publication both sides were trying 'to get a deal signed off'.</p>

<p>The insider said: 'Numerous meetings and secret squirrel script readings were had at the back end of last year.</p>

<p>Low profile: The star tried to keep a low profile and at one stage he was spotted wearing a grey baseball cap with black sunglasses</p>

<p>Keeping safe: James also made sure he remained cautious amid the global Covid-19 crisis and was wearing a face mask upon arrival</p>

<p>'Producers wanted a Brit and James ticks all the boxes - tall, strapping, physically fit and, of course, looks great in a dinner jacket.</p>

<p>'Everyone is hoping to get the deal confirmed and signed off, with an announcement in the summer.'</p>

<p>The hunt for a new Bond began in 2016 when Daniel, 51, admitted he was 'over it' after being cast in the role since Casino Royale in 2006.</p>

<p>'I'd rather break this glass and slash my wrists,' he told Time Out when asked whether he would do another Bond film.</p>

<p>'No, not at the moment. Not at all. That's fine. I'm over it at the moment. We're done. All I want to do is move on.' </p>

<p>The latest film in the Bond franchise - No Time To Die - stars Daniel in his final outing as the spy and is set to be released later this year after coronavirus delayed the April premiere.</p>

<p>James, meanwhile plays the titular character Gareth Jones in his drama film Mr. Jones, which was released on February 7.</p>

<p>The movie tells the true story of a Welsh journalist who travelled to the Soviet Union in 1933 and uncovers some unpleasant truths about an international conspiracy.</p>

<p>James also starred in Little Women, alongside the likes of Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Timothée Chalamet, Laura Dern, and Meryl Streep earlier this year.</p>
