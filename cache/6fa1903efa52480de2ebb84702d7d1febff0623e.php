<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton produced the fastest lap in history to take pole position for the Italian Grand Prix â€“ as Ferrari endured another humbling on their own Monza track.</p>

<p>It was the Britonâ€™s 94th pole and makes him favourite to extend his 47-point championship lead in Sundayâ€™s race at the Cathedral of Speed.</p>

<p>He buzzed around the 11 corners of the 3.54-mile track at an average speed of 164.267mph, beating the previous best of 163.785mph set by Kimi Raikkonen in a Ferrari two years ago.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton produced the fastest lap in history to take pole position for the Italian GP</p>

<p>The Brit just pipped team-mate Valtteri Bottas in a thrilling qualifying session at Monza</p>

<p>Hamiltonâ€™s team-mate Valtteri Bottas was second best by seven-hundredths of a second which shows that the change to the qualifying mode settings introduced here have done nothing significant to temper the pace of the all-conquering Mercedes. Carlos Sainz of McLaren will start third â€“ a fabulous turnaround after the teamâ€™s setbacks of recent years.</p>

<p>Sergio Perez, of Racing Points, was fourth fastest and Verstappen fifth. McLarenâ€™s Briton Lando Norris was sixth quickest.</p>

<p>But what woe at Ferrari. Coming on the back of an appalling performance in Belgium last week, Sebastian Vettel got caught in traffic at the end of Q1 and qualified a lowly 17th.</p>

<p>Carlos Sainz produced a great qualifying session to put his McLaren on third for the race</p>

<p>â€˜What a mess,â€™ said the German. â€˜Why did the Alfas have to overtake everybody.â€™ Actually, the pertinent questions and answers really lay closer to Ferrariâ€™s door.</p>

<p>Charles Leclerc at least made it into Q2 but there was hardly much respite from the agony as he soon tumbled out, in 13th place. Thank heavens there are no fans here.</p>

<p>â€˜The best I can do, the best I can do,â€™ bemoaned Leclerc, resigned to his fate. Two-tenths of a second off 10th place fairly represented the Scuderiaâ€™s true speed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, it was a day to forget for Ferrari with both cars failing to make Q3 on Saturday</p>

<p>It was the first time since 1984 that neither Ferrari has started their home race in the top 10. Oh dear.</p>

<p>Britainâ€™s George Russell, of Williams, was also held up in the traffic as several congested drivers competed for the tow. He qualified second last and turned the air blue. â€˜F*** me boys, what are we playing at? We need to be the ones capitalising on these f*** ups, not being the ones f****** up.â€™</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>And Hamilton has snatched pole away from Bottas!Â </p>

<p>The Finn went sub-1:20 again but Hamilton pulled it out of the bag once again, posting an incredible 1:18.887, only 0.069 seconds quicker than his team-mate.Â </p>

<p>Carlos Sainz has had a flyer out there, too, putting himself 3rd for Sunday's race, with Perez starting in 4th.</p>

<p>Max Verstappen, though, can only manage 5thÂ </p>

<p>Here's your top ten for tomorrow's race:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hamilton</p></li>
<li><p>Bottas</p></li>
<li><p>Sainz</p></li>
<li><p>Perez</p></li>
<li><p>VerstappenÂ </p></li>
<li><p>Norris</p></li>
<li><p>Ricciardo</p></li>
<li><p>Stroll</p></li>
<li><p>Albon</p></li>
<li><p>Gasly</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Hamilton and Bottas are having one final go at a hot lap now. Neither driver managed to better Bottas' lap record in Q2 but can the Finn close the gap on his team-mate?Â </p>

<p>Mercedes have decided to spring a surprise on the rest of the pack and have made an early exit from the pits, getting a jump on the other teams who must now go out despite not being fully ready.Â </p>

<p>Top ten with five minutes to go:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hamilton</p></li>
<li><p>Bottas</p></li>
<li><p>Perez</p></li>
<li><p>Verstappen</p></li>
<li><p>Sainz</p></li>
<li><p>Norris</p></li>
<li><p>Ricciardo</p></li>
<li><p>Gasly</p></li>
<li><p>Stroll</p></li>
<li><p>Albon</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The cars are returning to the garage and preparing to go back out for an optimal lap.</p>

<p>Perez will be very happy about putting his Racing Point behind the two Mercedes, although he is a huge six-tenths behind the team - underlining just how special that car is.</p>

<p>Bottas is being wary not to give Hamilton a toe now, with Hamilton due to return the favour on the second flying lap.Â </p>

<p>Bottas posts a 1:19.121 and Hamilton is quicker! By less than a tenth of a second, Hamilton has provisional pole with eight minutes to go.Â </p>

<p>Perez is in provisional third, with Verstappen behind in fourth while the McLarens occupy the third row.Â </p>

<p>Alex Albon's time has been deleted for exceeding track limits.</p>

<p>The third and final qualifying session is now underway. The ten drivers out on the track have 12 minutes to clinch pole for tomorrow's race.</p>

<p>It is surely a matter of who out of Hamilton and Bottas will start at the front of the grid, though.Â </p>

<p>Vettel frustrated talking to Sky Sports earlier.</p>

<p>'There was no point to start overtaking each other. The moment you start overtaking, you can cause trouble and thatâ€™s what it was.'</p>

<p>Coming up... final laps of Q2!#ItalianGP ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ #F1 pic.twitter.com/DGNO5aVjN7</p>

<p>Blimey, these Mercedes are incredible. Valtteri Bottas has set a new track record with 1:18.952, Hamilton can't better that.</p>

<p>But the major story here is that Charles Leclerc has failed to make it to Q3, ending a nightmare qualifying session for Ferrari at their home track.</p>

<p>'Best I can do,' Leclerc concedes over the team radio.</p>

<p>So at this stage we say goodbye to: Daniil Kvyat, Esteban Ocon, Charles Leclerc, Kimi Rakkonen and Kevin Magnussen.Â </p>

<p>Ricciardo has a go at a final lap but goes very wide and kicks up dust after hitting the gravel, that's no good for the Australian.Â </p>

<p>'This is going to get messy,' says Lando Norris.</p>

<p>The cars have piled out onto the track. The Mercedes are at the head of the pack again, not bothered about the shenanigans behind them.Â </p>

<p>Under three minutes left of Q2.</p>

<p>While a host of drivers have struggled to stay within the track limits today, the Mercedes car is a different beast and is gripping to the track beautifully.Â </p>

<p>It feels as though you're watching a different competition altogether with Bottas and Hamilton bettering each other while the rest compete for a slipstream.Â </p>

<p>Half a second separates Perez in third and Ocon in 12th. Five minutes to go.</p>

<p>All the drivers have crossed the line and as it stands, Kvyat, Ocon, Leclerc, Magnussen and Raikkonen are in danger of missing out on Q3.Â </p>

<p>Top ten as it stands:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Hamilton</p></li>
<li><p>Bottas</p></li>
<li><p>Perez</p></li>
<li><p>Sainz</p></li>
<li><p>Verstappen</p></li>
<li><p>Gasly</p></li>
<li><p>Stroll</p></li>
<li><p>Norris</p></li>
<li><p>Ricciardo</p></li>
<li><p>Albon</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Bottas is on his way on a flying lap, with Hamilton following behind while Verstappen is looking to get a slipstream from the six-time world champion.</p>

<p>The Finn sets a time of 1:19.417, better than Hamilton's time in Q1.Â </p>

<p>But Hamilton is on a different level, crossing the line with 1:19.092, over three tenths quicker than his team-mate.Â </p>

<p>Q2 is now under way! Expect more of the madness we saw just now, as the drivers look to gain the upper hand with the all-important toe.</p>

<p>The Mercedes are out and don't seem too bothered about the farcical queuing we've just seen, looking to set a fast pace nice and early on the softs.</p>

<p>A reminder that the slowest five drivers will miss out on Q3.</p>

<p>That was <em>seriously</em> close out there... and it's only Q1! ðŸ‘€#ItalianGP ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ #F1 pic.twitter.com/MB2szOZUc1</p>

<p>That was absolute bedlam out there. With very few winners from that kerfuffle. The headline news is that Sebastian Vettel has not bettered his time and will not make it to Q2.Â </p>

<p>'What a mess,' Vettel says on the team radio. 'Why did the Alphas have to overtake everybody?'</p>

<p>Hamilton ends Q1 the fastest driver, with Bottas following behind in second.</p>

<p>So at this stage we say goodbye to: Romain Grosjean, Sebastian Vettel, Antonio Giovinazzi, George Russell and Nicholas Latifi.Â </p>

<p>It's pretty messy as we approach the starting line now, with the drivers jostling for a good toe. This feels like a race, not qualifying! Six cars are bunched up and Raikkonen is hampered by Esteban Ocon as the two cars come very close together.Â </p>

<p>It's madness out there.</p>

<p>The drivers had returned to the pits and most have come back out for a final crack at a fast lap.Â </p>

<p>Vettel has dropped into the bottom five and is in need of a big lap to make it to Q2.Â </p>

<p>Turn 11 appearing to cause problems for drivers in exceeding track limits, Albon has just had his lap time deleted for that. Hamilton is a huge half a second clear of Sergio Perez in third.</p>

<p>So much for that party mode ban, eh</p>

<p>Several lap times have been deleted for passing the white line on the final corner, including Charles Leclerc, Lance Stroll and Pierre Gasly#ItalianGP ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ #F1 pic.twitter.com/I2hKGmTWat</p>

<p>Less than eight minutes to go and as it stands, we will be saying goodbye to Kimi Raikkonen, Nicholas Latifi, Kevin Magnussen, Charles Leclerc and Pierre Gasly.</p>

<p>The latter two don't have a time yet as their first attempts were wiped off for exceeding track limits.</p>

<p>Bottas momentarily goes top with 1:19.786, sub 1:20 is very impressive indeed.</p>

<p>But here comes Hamilton who puts his Mercedes top with a time of 1:19.539.</p>

<p>The midfield is already packed with the drivers trying to get that all important toe as they approach the hot lap.Â </p>

<p>The two Mercedes are out having a crack at a fast lap.</p>

<p>And Magnussen is first to post a time, with Kimi Raikkonen following closely behind.Â </p>

<p>The Haas driver posts a 1:21.6 while the Finn is a tenth slower. Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have both crossed the line and go first and second, with the German close to two tenths slower than Leclerc's 1:20.970.</p>

<p>However, the latter's time has been deleted for exceeding track limits.Â </p>

<p>A host of cars have emerged on the Monza track, led by the Haas duo of Kevin Magnussen and Romain Grosjean.Â </p>

<p>Qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix is under way! The drivers have 18 minutes to complete their fastest lap, with the five slowest drivers eliminated from Q2.Â </p>

<p>Not long now until qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix gets underway in Monza.</p>

<p>After yesterday's two practice sessions, it appeared that a Mercedes one-two would be a formality today, but this morning's final practice session makes for an intriguing afternoon's action ahead of us.</p>

<p>So, can Lewis Hamilton secure his 94th career pole today? Expect mayhem to ensue this afternoon!</p>

<p>NoÂ fans at Monza might just suit Mattia Binotto. The Ferrari team principal is under such pressure that he wondered whether to resign.</p>

<p>Usually, spectators crowd the bottleneck at the end of the paddock, pushing their autograph books into the palms of the Ferrari drivers as they climb into their road cars on the way to the teamâ€™s Hotel de la Ville retreat down the road.</p>

<p>According to Formula One, there is a 0% chance of rain during today's qualifying session.</p>

<p>Eight drivers are due to see the race stewards as a result of a number of separate incidents in which drivers looked to catch a slipstream off their rivals to set a quick lap in FP3.Â </p>

<p>On Friday we saw a really messy situation in Formula 3 with a huge queue of cars looking to get a tow for a hot lap - which can improve times by as much as 0.7 seconds.</p>

<p>It's going to be interesting to see how it pans out from 2pm, with race stewards surely looking to keep on top of a situation that could quickly become farcical, as was the case last year.Â </p>

<p>The Mercedes may have dominated over the two practice sessions on Friday but it was McLaren who enjoyed a strong FP3 this morning, with Carlos Sainz and Lando Norris placing in the top three, behind Valtteri Bottas.</p>

<p>Hamilton was down in 5th, four-tenths behind his Mercedes team-mate.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome to Sportsmailâ€™s live coverage of Formula One qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>Last weekend it was a case of another race, another win for Lewis Hamilton. The Brit dominated from start to finish as he comfortably won the Belgian Grand Prix in Spa.</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s qualifying session will see the removal of â€˜party modeâ€™ for the first time, meaning teams must use a single engine mode only for the duration of the session. If Hamiltonâ€™s display in practice on Friday is anything to go by, it should have little effect on the six-time world champion.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for live updates from all three qualifying sessions in Monza, with the action due to get underway at 2pm.</p>
