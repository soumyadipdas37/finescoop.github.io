<p>Woolworths will drop prices on more than 140 items in-store and online from Wednesday, September 30, while Coles has already reduced 190 of its best-sellers.</p>

<p>Jars of cranberry sauce are down to $2.50 in both stores, but Coles is $5 cheaper for tiger prawns while Woolworths narrowly comes out on top for mince pies.</p>

<p>Battle of the supermarkets: Coles and Woolworths have discounted hundreds of items in the run up to Christmas, including festive favourites like cranberry sauce, prawns and mince pies</p>

<p>Dozens of festive favourites have been discounted, with six-packs of own-brand mince pies down from $2 to $1.80 at Coles and $1.70 to $1.50 at Woolworths. </p>

<p>Lunchtime seafood is cheaper than ever, with kilos of black tiger prawns down from $28 to $22 at Coles and $30 to $27 at Woolworths.</p>

<p>The cost of cranberry sauce has also been cut, with jars marked down from $2.65 to $2.50 in both supermarkets.</p>

<p>Coles Chief Executive of Commercial and Express Greg Davis said the company recognises the growing need for affordable products as Australia's unemployment figure hovers around 920,000 or 6.8 percent.</p>

<p>'We're committed to lowering the cost of Christmas, as we know it's more important than ever,' he said.</p>
