<p>Marni Jackson said she's had problems with extreme bloating since she was just 12 years old, when she was so young she didn't really know what was wrong with her.</p>

<p>'I knew a little bit about bloating because my mum had always struggled with it to some extent, but mine was so much worse,' Marni told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Even when I ate small meals or snacks, my stomach would end up bulging and uncomfortable and I would have these terrible cramps.</p>

<p>A 21-year-old childcare instructor from Perth who has struggled with 'crippling' bloating since the age of 12 has banished it in four days with the help of one $44 supplement (pictured now)</p>

<p>BEFORE: Marni Jackson said she has had problems with extreme bloating since she was just 12 years old, when she was so young she didn't really know what was wrong with her</p>

<p>AFTER: She stumbled upon the JSHealth Detox and Debloat vitamins online and after just four days, she noticed a huge improvement</p>

<p>'All of this led to me having an unhealthy relationship with food, as I was either trying not to eat or binge eating because I was so hungry.'</p>

<p>Marni said she has tried all sorts of solutions in the past, from supplements to cutting out foods from her diet.</p>

<p>'About a year ago, I switched from Hi-Lo Light milk to soy milk, which did decrease the bloating for a while,' she said.</p>

<p>'But it still flared up unannounced whenever I ate something I wasn't used to. </p>

<p>'I have found out now that my main triggers are lactose and dairy, so I try to avoid them all of the time.'</p>

<p>Marni (pictured) said she has tried all sorts of solutions in the past, from supplements to cutting out foods from her diet, and she has realised that lactose triggers it</p>

<p>Marni stumbled upon the JSHealth Detox and Debloat capsules when browsing the internet for a solution.</p>

<p>She recently invested in the $44 capsules in an attempt to stave off her abdominal bloating and support liver detoxification.</p>

<p>Within four days, the 21-year-old said she started to see 'results'.</p>

<p>'And by day 12, my bloating has completely disappeared ad I feel so much better,' Marni said.</p>

<p>'It's not just the physical side where I've seen results, but also mentally, I feel so much happier and am no longer starving myself from not eating enough food.' </p>

<p>The tablets (pictured) include ingredients such as milk thistle, turmeric and fennel </p>

<p>* Milk Thistle: This ingredient is traditionally used in western herbal medicine to maintain and support natural liver cleansing and detoxification processes. </p>

<ul>
<li>Turmeric: This is proven to maintain and support liver health, and acts as a hepatoprotectant to protect the liver. Turmeric is also a strong antioxidant, which can reduce free radicals formed in the body. </li>
</ul>

<p>* Fennel: Fennel is traditionally used in western herbal medicine to relieve digestive discomfort and decrease, reduce, and relieve abdominal bloating and distention.</p>

<p>Another said they have been a 'lifesaver' for her bloating.</p>

<p>'My weight has always been pretty stable but I have found after meals I feel bloated and uncomfortable,' she wrote. </p>
