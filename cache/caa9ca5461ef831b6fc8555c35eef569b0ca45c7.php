<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Michy Batshuayi is set for a loan return to Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Chelsea striker Batshuayi, 26, is expected to sign a one-year extension to his current contract at Stamford Bridge and then re-join Palace for the season.</p>

<p>Batshuayi’s existing Chelsea deal expires next summer and the additional 12 months will ensure he does not become a free agent once his loan expires.</p>

<p>Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi looks set to return to Crystal Palace on loan next season</p>

<p>Batshuayi spent half-a-season on loan at Crystal Palace, where he scored seven goals in total</p>

<p>Batshuayi joined Chelsea for £33m from Marseille in 2016 but has struggled for regular game time and been pushed further down the pecking order this summer following the Blues’ spending spree.</p>

<p>The £53m signing of Timo Werner, in addition to forwards Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud already in the squad, means Batshuayi is effectively fourth-choice in Frank Lampard's options up top.  </p>

<p>While on Chelsea’s books Batshuayi has spent time on loan at Valencia, Borussia Dortmund and Palace and his spell at Selhurst Park was especially successful, with Batshuayi scoring seven times in just 13 games in the second half of the 2018-19 season.</p>

<p>Palace are now confident of re-signing Batshuayi ,who has also been linked with the likes of West Brom, Newcastle, Leeds and clubs in Germany.</p>

<p>He signed amid much promise in the summer of 2016 from Marseille, yet was a bit-part player from the off under Antonio Conte. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old is now down the pecking order in manager Frank Lampard's options up front</p>

<p>The Belgian striker has failed to cement a regular starting spot since signing four years ago</p>

<p>That being said, he scored the goal which clinched the 2016-17 Premier League title at West Brom.</p>

<p>Yet the following season, Batshuayi moved on loan to Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, where he effectively replaced Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who had just joined Arsenal. </p>

<p>Loan spells at Valencia and Palace followed, before a second chance by Lampard was not capitalised on last season. </p>
