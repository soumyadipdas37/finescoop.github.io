<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who claims she can communicate with animals has baffled This Morning viewers, after saying a horse predicted her friend would meet her soulmate.  </p>

<p>Beth Lee-Crowther, from the West Midlands, appeared on the show today alongside her pal Caroline McKain, her partner and her horse Fred - who Beth claims told her about the new relationship, while they were communicating telepathically. </p>

<p>The psychic medium said that she's been able to communicate with animals from a young age, and was able to speak with Fred 'on a deeper level', to ask for details about who pal Caroline would end up with. </p>

<p>But despite Fred and Beth's predictions about her new boyfriend coming true, viewers weren't convinced by the animal whisperer. </p>

<p>Beth Lee-Crowther (pictured left) , from the West Midlands, claims she can communicate with animals and says a horse predicted her friend Caroline McKain (pictured right with her new partner) would meet her soulmate</p>

<p>'I've always been able to communicate with animals,' said Beth. 'But it wasn't until I got a bit older, I realised people weren't having the same experiences as me, hearing them - and I also get pictures from them telepathically as well.' </p>

<p>When asked whether her ability was a shock to her, she said: 'It wasn't a shock because I was young, it was normal. </p>

<p>'It wasn't until I got a bit older I realised I wasn't the same as other people.' </p>

<p>Beth believes that all animals are also psychic, and that the horse told her Caroline would meet her soulmate 'quickly' and would 'get on really well' despite their differences. </p>

<p>Despite Fred and Beth's predictions about her new boyfriend coming true, viewers weren't convinced by the animal whisperer</p>

<p>'I believe all animals are psychic,' she said, 'Caroline was wanting to meet a new partner. </p>

<p>'What I got from Fred was her soulmate would come [into her life] quite quickly, they would be different, but would get on really well.' </p>

<p>But viewers didn't seem impressed, with one writing: '#thismorning <?php echo e('@'); ?>hollywills and <?php echo e('@'); ?>Schofe look like it is taking all of their strength to contain themselves while listening to the #horsewhisperer.'</p>

<p>'Neigh, I don’t believe this,' wrote another. </p>

<p>A third teased: 'What a coincidence. My dog told me that the features editor on #ThisMorning had run out of ideas.' </p>

<p>The Psychic Medium says that she's been able to communicate with animals from a young age and can be sent pictures 'telepathically' by animals </p>

<p>Beth and Fred predicted that Caroline's new partner would be 'tall with dark hair' and 'be on the water a lot', with a large scar on one of his legs, all of which came true </p>

<p>Beth and Fred predicted that Caroline's new partner would be 'tall with dark hair' and 'be on the water a lot', with a large scar on one of his legs. </p>

<p>'Caroline was curious, said Beth, so I was able to communicate [with Fred] on a deeper level and he told me he [her new boyfriend]  would be tall with dark hair, with a big scar on his leg.' </p>

<p>Caroline went on: 'She even told me he would be in water a lot and he's a skipper by profession. </p>

<p>'We were on the third meeting and we got chatting about accidents and he said "No [he'd had none]" and I thought, "Oh he's not the one" and later he said that at 18 he'd had an operation on his leg!' </p>

<p>Beth told hosts Holly Willoughby and Philip Schofield (both pictured)  predictions started when Caroline was looking for help with her animal's behaviour, and was able to tap into 'how he felt in general'</p>

<p>The predictions started when Caroline was looking for help with her animal's behaviour, and was able to tap into 'how he felt in general'.   </p>

<p>'In the beginning she was looking for help with her horse Fred,' said Beth. 'And as an animal communicator, I was able to tune in and talk about behaviour issues and how they feel in general. </p>

<p>'What I started to notice when I started communicating with animals is they were giving me information for their owners that was coming true.' </p>
