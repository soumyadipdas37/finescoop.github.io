<p>Happy couple: Jeff Brazier insists his marriage to wife Kate Dwyer is stronger than ever as the couple celebrate their second wedding anniversary following a turbulent 12-months</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Had such a lovely time celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary yesterday that I forgot to do the Instagram post!</p>

<p>'We did all the things we loved, Par 3 golf, <?php echo e('@'); ?>fredanddougs, <?php echo e('@'); ?>davidlloyduk to train &amp; sit and read in the spa &amp; then one of our favourite restaurants to finish up.'</p>

<p>He added: 'The key for us reaching 2 years in style? (<?php echo e('@'); ?>katebrazierpr and I are stronger now than we’ve ever been).</p>

<p>It must be love: The presenter, 41, paid tribute to Kate on social media as they stepped out for a romantic meal in east London to celebrate the special day</p>

<p>'Own our flaws, share them, take responsibility for improving them, invest time into finding things we love to do together &amp; acknowledge that the way you communicate with one another is massive but especially so when one of us is ‘triggered’</p>

<p>'Also recognise that what you brought into the relationship could be the undoing of it unless you’re brave enough to embrace the vulnerability.</p>

<p>'So if like us, you’re in a relationship that’s strong enough to support the growth you’re both going through, you’re always in with a shout.</p>

<p>'Proud of how far we’ve come <?php echo e('@'); ?>katebrazierpr and thank you for a lovely day yesterday.'</p>

<p>The couple, who met in Portugal, married on September 15th 2018 but experienced some problems late last year, with Jeff pictured not wearing his wedding ring.</p>

<p>Jeff, a father to sons Bobby and Freddie from his relationship with the late Jade Goody, later revealed the couple were back on track, telling HELLO! magazine they 'paused and reset' their marriage.</p>

<p>Jeff explained: 'Now we are a million times better because we took the time to invest in ourselves.</p>

<p>'I am so proud that the two of us have got to the point where things are more straightforward and more simple and easier than they have ever been between us.</p>

<p>'We are stronger for the two months that we've spent together with time to just focus on one another. Kate and I have had an opportunity to press pause and reset.'</p>

<p>PR director Kate added: 'For us, day to day, we have realised how much we love each other's company. Marriage isn't always easy and our struggles were often because we didn't see each other. Now we are stronger than ever.' </p>

<p>In 2019 Jeff spoke about concerns he had with his marriage, telling MailOnline:  'Being married makes you feel more settled, but life doesn't feel much different because Kate has a wonderful career in PR where she works very hard and long hours...</p>

<p>'So it's still just me and the boys at home a fair bit. I'm not sure whether we'll have children.</p>

<p>'I'm just as happy if we do or don't, and I'm content to be patient and let Kate figure all that out.'</p>

<p>A representative confirmed the pair were still working on their marriage, following a report from The Sun which claimed they had unfollowed each other on Instagram.</p>

<p>Jeff's spokesperson said: 'There is categorically no split between Jeff and Kate. We're slightly bewildered how the story has come about.</p>

<p>'However, they have had some difficulties but they are doing their utmost to work through them together and will continue to do so in private.'</p>
