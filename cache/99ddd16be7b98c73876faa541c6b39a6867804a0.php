<p>'This is very cool and about time. I've seen that Barbie are doing this as well,' said one commenter.</p>

<p>'Nice to see a little diversity but I would love to see dolls that are African, Asian ect. There no diversity in race,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'Absolutely LOVE this! My mum was blind and I still have some of her mobility aids, I actually want the doll to go with it on the display now'.</p>

<p>Each doll is $6 each and comes in its own outfit, which can be mixed and matched between them</p>

<p>Another said: 'As someone who uses a wheelchair, I think this is fantastic!'</p>

<p>'Breaking the stereotypes... beauty is always associated with physical appearance so hats off to the designer of these dolls,' one woman said. </p>

<p>The Our Generation dolls at Target offer a similar range of inclusive characters and accessories, but these toys start from $32.</p>
