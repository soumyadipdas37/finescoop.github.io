<p>Shoppers have awarded the Homecube Portable Sound Machine a near-perfect score of 4.7 out of 5 calling it 'an absolute lifesaver' and 'a godsend'</p>

<p>Whether it's the street outside or your mind that's noisy, a white noise or sleep machine can offer welcome 'anti-noise'. </p>

<p>The little gadget works by filling the silence with a steady background noise which reduces the shock of abrupt sounds, calming the mind and relaxing you ready for sleep. </p>

<p>Reading the customers' reviews section is a great way to tell if the device is suited to you. With 85 per cent of shoppers giving the Homecube Portable Sound Machine a full five-star rating, this device deserves a spot on your nightstand if you struggle with sleep.</p>

<p>Suitable for babies and adults alike, the Homecube Portable Sound Machine is equipped with an impressive array of features that have been given the thumbs up from shoppers.</p>

<p>The oddly soothing machine offers seven white noise, seven fan sounds, and 15 relaxing natural sounds including rain, ocean wave, and campfire sounds so you can personalise your own sleep therapy. Not bad for its small price tag.  </p>

<p>It also includes a noise-reduction timer, which can be programmed in 30, 60 and 90-minute increments, gradually lowering the volume as you drift off. </p>

<p>One shopper raved: 'Relaxes you into sleep. If you or your child struggle to get to sleep, then this is really worth having. It's so relaxing and has a sound for most people. I've had insomnia since childhood, my autistic mind doesn't like sleep as much as my body needs it. This helps me to switch off by being absorbed by the sounds.'  </p>

<p>A second shopper wrote: 'This little machine has been a Godsend, I can adjust it to the sounds I like, and it more or less blocks the loud noises and enables me to sleep better. I do like the rain, waves and bird noises which are very clear and realistic.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, writing: 'Love this little machine. It's so compact, easy to use and has loads of different noises. I was using my phone with waves, but its very bright and a real faff in the middle of the night. </p>

<p>'This machine is one button press, it remembers the last noise you programmed and you can use it without the light. It charges very quickly and the charge lasts for several nights.'</p>

<p>Small and unobtrusive, it will sit discreetly on your bedside and thanks to the rechargeable battery pack, it's perfect for bringing with you on your travels. Alternatively, you can also charge it through the wall socket. </p>

<p>The Homecube Portable Sound Machine is also loved by new parents, with one shopper calling it the 'Baby whisperer'.  </p>

<p>'Absolutely amazing! It's a must need for me with a baby...I struggled with him waking up for every small noise, but this was amazing. I just keep the white noise on for him, and it lets him stay asleep for a long time.'  </p>
