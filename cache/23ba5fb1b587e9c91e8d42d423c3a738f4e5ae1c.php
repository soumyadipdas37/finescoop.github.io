<p>Everton expect to confirm the signing of James Rodriguez from Real Madrid </p>

<p>Rodriguez, who joined Real Madrid in 2014 from Monaco, has struggled to convince at the Bernabeu, having been sent out on loan for two seasons to Bayern Munich in 2017. </p>

<p>Despite being handed chances to impress by Zinedine Zidane, it is now clear his future remains away from the LaLiga champions, and Goodison Park could prove his next destination. </p>

<p>It follows the news earlier this week that the Toffees had been handed the chance to sign the 29-year-old, who has just one year left on his current deal at the Bernabeu. </p>

<p>According to Marca, Carlo Ancelotti has played a key role in convincing the Colombian</p>

<p>Rodriguez has played under current Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti at both Bayern Munich and Real Madrid, with a strong working relationship previously appearing to hold a great deal of weight for the Colombian.  </p>

<p>Talks are ongoing with Watford over Abdoulaye Doucoure. </p>

<p>Everton are set to complete a deal for Allan, says Napoli chairman Aurelio De Laurentiis</p>
