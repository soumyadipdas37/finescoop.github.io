<p>RACE YOU THERE</p>

<p>Bargain beauty-hunters already know that Wilko, celebrating 90 years on the High Street this month, is the go-to place for affordable skincare and cosmetics. Its latest launch is a new, 100 per cent vegan make-up range called (bafflingly) the Body Collection. With prices starting at £1.50 for a double-ended Brow Definer Pencil and £2.50 for a Lip Crush Liquid Lipstick (right), you’ll find all you need to give your make-up bag an autumn makeover. </p>

<p>ANJELICA’S SCENT SUCCESS </p>

<p>Anjelica Huston (pictured) is set to join singer Florence Welch, actress and model Jodie Turner‑Smith and designer Susie Cave in a campaign for Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum </p>

<p>Anjelica Huston is one of four new faces of Gucci Bloom Eau de Parfum (£54, theperfumeshop.com). The fragrance captures the scent of a flower garden, with its notes of tuberose, jasmine and South Indian Rangoon creeper. The 69-year-old actress will make her Bloom debut with the other new faces (singer Florence Welch, actress and model Jodie Turner‑Smith and designer Susie Cave) in an advertising campaign shot in Umbria, Italy. </p>

<p>THIS WORKS</p>

<p> We love anything that works in seconds to produce glowing skin. Like an instant recharge, the new Erborian Red Pepper Pulp Radiance Booster Gel Cream does just that. The fast-absorbing gel, which contains vitamins and minerals, is a natural brightening-booster.</p>

<p>IS EXFOLIATING AGEING MY SKIN? </p>

<p>Yes, it might well be. Exfoliating is an important step for brightening skin, but overdoing it can have a drying effect.</p>

<p>Cosmetic doctor Lauren Hamilton, who is the founder of the Victor &amp; Garth Skin Clinic, says: ‘If you fall into the trap of over-exfoliating, you can weaken your skin’s barrier function, which will leave you susceptible to harsh elemental effects, from sun damage to air pollution, as well as irritation.’ </p>

<p>The new Dermalogica Hydro Masque Exfoliant is a five-minute at-home treatment that contains bamboo for gentle exfoliation. It can be used up to twice a week to boost hydration for a healthy, glowing complexion.</p>

<p>SHAMELESS INDULGENCE</p>

<p>If you are looking for a new favourite fragrance for the autumn, the latest from Giorgio Armani, My Way, might be the one. Not only is the white flowers-infused fragrance gently feminine, it is consciously kind to the planet.</p>

<p>In keeping with Armani Beauty’s new eco- credentials — the brand has committed to achieving carbon neutrality for all products by 2025 — the perfume is made with recycled and recyclable materials (such as a bottle refill system), plus sustainably-sourced ingredients. Notes of vanilla, tuberose and orange blossom combine to produce a fresh, floral scent, while the sleek, glass bottle has all the elegance and glamour you expect from Armani.</p>
