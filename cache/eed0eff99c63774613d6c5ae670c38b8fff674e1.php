<p>Matthew Denice was riding his motorbike when he was hit by a truck and became trapped under the wheel arch</p>

<p>A motorcyclist was killed after being dragged for over a quarter of a mile trapped under the truck of a suspected drink driver.</p>

<p>Horrified witnesses banged on the driver's window in an attempt to get him to stop.</p>

<p>Others chased the vehicle along the road screaming at its driver Nicholas Guaman to stop.</p>

<p>Police said the 23 year old victim Matthew Denice was still alive when he became trapped in the wheel arch of Guaman's truck.</p>

<p>But he died from massive injuries from being dragged along the road.</p>

<p>Guaman, a 34 year old illegal immigrant from Ecuador, showed no emotion when he was told the motorcyclist he hit was dead.</p>

<p>He failed a roadside breath test after being stopped by police.</p>

<p>The horrific accident took place as allegedly Guaman jumped a red light in Milford, Massachusetts.</p>

<p>He hit Denice but failed to stop.</p>

<p>Families grilling outside and sitting on their porches heard the crash and about a half dozen people chased the pick-up truck on foot and banged on the door trying to get the driver to stop," said Milford Police Sgt. Mike Pighetti.</p>

<p>The victim's body was dragged for over quarter of a mile before Guaman ran off the road and the body dropped from the wheel arch.</p>

<p>Witnesses said Guaman, who had his six year old son in the Ford pick up truck, then backed up over the body.</p>

<p>Guaman attempted to flee from the scene was but arrested by police.</p>

<p>Denice was alive when Guaman dragged him with his truck, said Worcester County District Attorney spokesman Paul Jarvey.</p>

<p>He had recently graduated from Framingham State University with a computer degree and hoped to work in law enforcement</p>

<p>His mother Maureen Maloney said he son had his whole life ahead of him.</p>

<p>Asked if she was angry, she said: "I can't have anger. I'm just so broken-hearted to not have my son."</p>

<p>Denice's stepfather, Michael Maloney, called the incident a "murder" and said Denice was a "great all-American kid."</p>

<p>The family said they want Guaman to be prosecuted in the US and receive a lengthy sentence, rather than simply being deported.</p>

<p>Milford Police Chief Thomas O'Loughlin said Guaman told police he was in the country illegally. Homeland Security is investigating and has issued a detainer warrant, which would become activated when the court process is completed.</p>

<p>He could face up to 15 years in jail if he is found guilty of the vehicular homicide charge.</p>

<p>Guaman has been charged with negligent vehicular homicide while driving under the influence of liquor, leaving the scene of an accident involving personal injury and death, possession of an open container of alcohol in a vehicle, failure to stop for police, unlicensed driving, failure to yield at a stop sign, resisting arrest and wanton or reckless conduct creating risk to a child, according to court documents.</p>
