<p>His boy: Jeff Brazier paid tribute to son Freddie on Instagram on Monday as he turned 16 and praises his 'sense of adventure, energy and enthusiasm and sensitivity around others'</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Had such a lovely time celebrating our 2nd wedding anniversary yesterday that I forgot to do the Instagram post! </p>

<p>'We did all the things we loved, Par 3 golf, <?php echo e('@'); ?>fredanddougs, <?php echo e('@'); ?>davidlloyduk to train &amp; sit and read in the spa &amp; then one of our favourite restaurants to finish up.'</p>

<p>He added: 'The key for us reaching 2 years in style? (<?php echo e('@'); ?>katebrazierpr and I are stronger now than we’ve ever been).</p>

<p>'Own our flaws, share them, take responsibility for improving them, invest time into finding things we love to do together &amp; acknowledge that the way you communicate with one another is massive but especially so when one of us is ‘triggered’</p>

<p>'Also recognise that what you brought into the relationship could be the undoing of it unless you’re brave enough to embrace the vulnerability.</p>

<p>'So if like us, you’re in a relationship that’s strong enough to support the growth you’re both going through, you’re always in with a shout.</p>

<p>'Proud of how far we’ve come <?php echo e('@'); ?>katebrazierpr and thank you for a lovely day yesterday.'</p>
