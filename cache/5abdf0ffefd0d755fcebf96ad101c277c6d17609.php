<p>Piedmont Police Chief Freddie Norton said the alleged incident took place in Piedmont High School's locker room in November.</p>

<p>The victim was dressing in the room after his junior high school's football season ended, his mom Vanessa Hicks told AL.com.</p>

<p>The Piedmont High School football team were also in the locker room at the time, when Ingram allegedly assaulted the victim with a key.  </p>

<p>Ingram, who was 18 at the time, no longer attends and plays football for Piedmont High. </p>

<p>The other two suspects have not been identified as they are underage.  </p>

<p>Hicks told AL.com her son started his freshman year at Piedmont High School this year and had to be taken out of school due to the trauma over the November attack.</p>

<p>'He should be enjoying his high school years but he can't because we had to pull him for school,' she said.</p>

<p>'I thought he was safe under the supervision of the school. Unfortunately, he wasn't. </p>

<p>'I will continue seeking justice and being his voice.'  </p>

<p>Ingram was booked into the Calhoun County Detention Center Monday on charges of third-degree assault.</p>

<p>Bryson Gregg Ingram, 19, of Piedmont, was arrested and charged with third-degree assault Monday over the incident that took place back in November at Piedmont High School (above)</p>

<p>He was later released after posting $3,000 bond. </p>

<p>The two other suspects were also charged with third-degree assault. </p>

<p>Calhoun County District Attorney Brian McVeigh said the suspects could face additional charges including sex offenses over the incident.  </p>

<p>DailyMail.com reached out to Piedmont High School Principal Adam Clemons for comment.</p>

<p>Clemons directed the request to the school district which did not immediately return DailyMail.com's call.  </p>

<p>It is not clear if the alleged assault marks one of the latest in a string of violent and dangerous hazing pranks taking place at schools and colleges across America. </p>

<p>In June, the former president of the now-defunct Sigma Pi fraternity at Ohio University pleaded guilty to drug and hazing charges following the November 2018 death of freshman Colin Wiant.</p>

<p>Wiant died of asphyxiation after ingesting nitrous oxide after he told a friend he was going to be hazed by fraternity members.</p>

<p>Ingram and two of his teammates are accused of forcing a key into the anal region of a junior high school student when the three older boys played for Piedmont High's football team (pictured an image of the football team)</p>

<p>It is alleged members of Sigma Pi forced him to ingest nitrous oxide from canisters while doing 'whippets' - huffing nitrous oxide from canisters, like whipped cream cans.</p>

<p>It also claimed the teen was beaten with a belt, pelted with eggs, deprived of sleep, forced to drink a gallon of alcohol in an hour, and forced to consume a toxic cocktail of cocaine, marijuana, Adderall and Xanax as part of his first year initiation.</p>

<p>In May, a federal appeals court said the parents of a Louisiana State University freshman who died after he was forced to chug hard liquor during an initiation ritual dubbed 'Bible Study', can pursue a lawsuit against the school. </p>

<p>Maxwell Gruver died from alcohol poisoning in 2017 after he participated in a fatal hazing ritual during a Phi Delta Theta fraternity party where he was allegedly told to chug 190-proof liquor if they gave wrong answers to questions about the fraternity or could not recite the Greek alphabet.</p>
