<p>The images have been shared online showing the consequences of flushing items, including nappies and sanitary products, down the toilet.</p>

<p>When these items combine with fats, oils and greases in the sewers, they create 'fatbergs', which cause blockages and pollution.    </p>

<p>Disgusting photos reveal giant 'fatbergs' blocking Suffolk sewers caused by flushing wet wipes and cotton buds down the toilet</p>

<p>The photos, published on Twitter by Anglican Water earlier this week were taken at Fornham Water Recycling Centre in Suffolk.</p>

<p>They show a skip full of waste extracted from the sewers which has been causing blockages, which is said to cost £19million a year to unclog. </p>

<p>Anglian Water is running a Keep It Clear campaign to educate people about the consequences of flushing items down the toilet. </p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'We clear 40,000 blockages across our network every single year and that equates to one blockage roughly every five minutes. </p>

<p>'Of these blockages, 85% are completely avoidable but cost us a whopping £19million a year to keep our sewers free of them. </p>

<p>'This money could ultimately be better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p>'Not only that, but blockages can lead to sewer flooding in people's homes and pollution in the wider environment.</p>

<p>'This is why people should only flush the three P's down their toilet 'pee, poo and (toilet) paper.' </p>

<p>Since the Keep It Clear campaign began, sewer blockages have dropped by an average of 52%.</p>
