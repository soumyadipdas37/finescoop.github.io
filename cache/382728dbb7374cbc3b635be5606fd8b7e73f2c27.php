<p>Myra-Rose Craig, 18, from Somerset, mounted a solitary protest on an ice floe at the edge of the Arctic Ocean yesterday to highlight climate change.</p>

<p>She was participating in Fridays for Future, a global campaign inspired by Miss Thunberg, the 17-year-old Swedish activist.</p>

<p>As she floated on the icy waters, Miss Craig held up a sign for Miss Thunberg’s Youth Strike for Climate movement.</p>

<p>Myra-Rose Craig, 18, from Somerset, mounted a solitary protest on an ice floe at the edge of the Arctic Ocean yesterday to highlight climate change</p>

<p>The British environmentalist, from the Chew Valley, south of Bristol, said she spent weeks travelling by road and boat to the Arctic edge north of the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard. </p>

<p>Her journey was part of a Greenpeace expedition to ‘bear witness to the sea ice minimum, the lowest level of ice at the end of each summer’.</p>

<p>Calling on ‘leaders and decision makers’ to ‘do something’ about climate change, she said: ‘Just floating in the middle of a sea of slush has really just reminded me how delicate the Arctic is.’</p>

<p>In a Twitter post, she wrote: ‘Time is running out. The Arctic is melting and could be gone by the time I’m in my 30s.’</p>

<p>Miss Craig, whose mother’s family are Bangladeshi, founded the Black2Nature charity that encourages inner-city children from black and ethnic minority backgrounds to explore the natural world. </p>

<p>Ice in the Arctic Ocean melted to its second-lowest level on record this summer, triggered by global warming along with natural forces.</p>

<p>The extent of ice-covered ocean at the North Pole, extending further south to Alaska, Canada, Greenland and Russia, reached its summertime low of 1.4million square miles lat week before starting to grow again.</p>

<p>In the 1980s, the ice cover was about 1million square miles bigger than current summer levels.</p>

<p>Miss Craig’s protest marked a day of global action held each Friday by children and youth activists to draw attention to climate change. Pictured: A child holds a sign with a drawing at a rally in support of the climate strike in Lisbon, Portugal</p>

<p>Pupils and students around the world have been striking on Fridays for nearly two years, a form of action pioneered by Miss Thunberg, who led a socially distanced protest in Sweden yesterday that was limited to 50 by lockdown laws.</p>

<p>Demonstrations were planned in at least 150 countries yesterday, although many were online.</p>

<p>In February, Miss Craig shared a platform with Miss Thunberg at a rally in Bristol.</p>

<p>The same month, Miss Craig, who attended Chew Valley secondary school, received an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Bristol. </p>

<p>She is believed to be the youngest Briton to receive such an award. A keen birdwatcher known as ‘Birdgirl’ online, she has campaigned for years to improve diversity in conservation work.</p>

<p>She became interested in nature because her parents are bird enthusiasts, but noticed there were few from ethnic minorities on birdwatching trips.</p>

<p>In 2015, Miss Craig set up a nature camp for 20 teenagers, which led to Black2Nature.</p>
