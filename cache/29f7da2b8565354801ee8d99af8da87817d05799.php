<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>P&amp;O Cruises has extended the suspension of sailings until early next year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The UK's largest cruise line said the decision was taken due to 'evolving restrictions on travel'.</p>

<p>The firm had previously cancelled sailings until November 12.</p>

<p>President Paul Ludlow said: 'With evolving restrictions on travel from the UK, unfortunately it is necessary to cancel these itineraries.</p>

<p>'These further cancellations vary according to ship as well as complexity and length of itineraries, advice and guidance regarding ports of call and current air availability for fly/cruises.</p>

<p>'We are continuing to monitor the overall situation closely and will certainly reintroduce cruises should the opportunity arise and it is feasible to do so.'</p>
