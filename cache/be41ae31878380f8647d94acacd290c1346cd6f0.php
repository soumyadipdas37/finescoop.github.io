<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She is part of the world's new generation of young supermodels.</p>

<p>But Kendall Jenner is keeping things au naturel on her Instagram page. </p>

<p>While many of her Kardashian sisters are known for using filters on their selfies, Kendall, 24, posted a paired down no-make up snap on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Au naturel: Kendall Jenner posts no makeup selfie as she poses in the mirror while brushing her teeth on Tuesday</p>

<p>Posing in the mirror while brushing her teeth, the daughter of Caitlyn Jenner promoted her brand Moon Oral Care, which makes products that are cruelty-free and vegan. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Moon released a range of popping candy breath mints, said to contain a 'a proprietary Elixir blend that features coconut and peppermint oil to support a fresh, healthy smile.'  </p>

<p>The idea behind the popping candy mints is that they are perfect for people on the go - with the brand suggesting that customers 'give a pack to a friend and create an orchestra of crackling, popping freshness'.  </p>

<p>Natural beauty: Kendall went for the natural look on Tuesday as she posted a snap without any filters or with makeup on </p>

<p>Described as 'ASMR-ready', the sugar-free, vegan breath mints are intended to provide all of the same freshness that you might get from more traditional mints or gum - but with an added dose of fun. </p>

<p>'The mints bring back the fun back to freshening your breath with a whole-mouth freshness that pops in the mouth with a popping breath mint,' a spokesperson for Moon explained. </p>

<p>Compared to her family, Kendall has been keeping a relatively low-profile lately, aside from her recent beach outing with rumored new beau Devin Booker. </p>

<p>The supermodel and Phoenix Suns player, 23, were caught putting on a very amorous display together just last month. </p>

<p>Kendall and Devin were first spotted together in April and have been fueling gossip ever since. Last month they appeared to go on a trip to Sedona, Arizona together, only intensifying rumors.</p>

<p>While Jenner's always shown a liking for basketball players - previously dating the 76ers' Ben Simmons and Pistons pro Blake Griffin - Booker's relationship history makes him an interesting choice.</p>

<p>Devin previously dated her sister Kylie's ex bestie Jordyn Woods, who was booted from the Kardashian/Jenner inner circle after smooching Khloe Kardashian's babydaddy Tristan Thompson, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers.</p>
