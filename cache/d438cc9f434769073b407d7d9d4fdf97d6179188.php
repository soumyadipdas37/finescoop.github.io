<p>Barcelona will reportedly have to pay £12million if they are to cancel striker Luis Suarez's deal</p>

<p>Suarez scored 21 goals in 36 games for Barcelona last season but at the age of 33 is very much in the latter stages of his career. He earns around £400,000-a-week.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan has less than a year remaining on his current contract at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Koeman is attempting to reshape Barcelona's squad off the back of a season without a trophy which led to the dismissal of his predecessor Quique Setien.</p>

<p>Barcelona's 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League prompted the club's desire for a significant overhaul.</p>

<p>In addition to the Suarez situation, Barcelona are still attempting to address Lionel Messi's future, with the Argentina star eager to leave the club.  </p>
