<p>Difficult: Katie reminded fans that they could donate to support life-saving research into IPF, which causes progressive and irreversible scarring of the lungs</p>

<p>She wrote: 'There are no words to express the love that my brother, sister <?php echo e('@'); ?>sophie_pricey and I have for our mum. As you know, this is something that's very close to my heart because my mum suffers from this condition. </p>

<p>'This week is IPF week. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a lung condition that scars your lungs and reduces the efficiency of your breathing. </p>

<p>'Approximately 6500 people are diagnosed with IPF every year. The <?php echo e('@'); ?>britishlungfoundation is asking for your support to help fund vital research and offer those with IPF hope for the future. See my latest story post for the link.'</p>

<p>Reunited: In recent months Amy has been shielding from her family to protect herself during the COVID-19 pandemic, after being diagnosed with IPF in 2017 (pictured in 2019)</p>

<p>In recent months Amy has been shielding from her family to protect herself during the COVID-19 pandemic, with Katie only able to see her mum through the window.</p>

<p>The pair were finally reunited in June after 10 weeks apart, though the star was unable to hug her mum as per social distancing rules.</p>

<p>After being diagnosed with IPF, Amy revealed she'd made the decision to move to Spain for the colder winter months in a bid to improve her declining health.</p>

<p>She said in April 2019: 'Late January I was suffering so much with the cold weather. I went to Spain and some friends found me a tiny little apartment by the sea.</p>

<p>'The warmer weather makes me feel much better. If I go walking in the U.K. I do 2,000 steps whereas in Spain I can do 10,000 steps and I don't cough.'</p>

<p>Katie also spoke at the time about how she first reacted to her mum's diagnosis, saying: 'The first time we appeared on the show I was crying. I couldn't cope and when you hear "terminal" you think she's not gone long left.'</p>

<p>Speaking about how IPF, a rare condition that causes progressive and irreversible scarring of the lungs, has progressed, Amy said: 'I’m not too bad. I went for tests this week with the transplant team, they keep an eye on me, my lung function tests have dropped a little bit but that’s to be expected with what I have got because it is a progressive illness.</p>

<p>'But they do all the tests on the other organs in your body to prepare you for when they think you need a transplant - I’m not yet [on the transplant list] - and what they do is that they look at everything to make sure you can cope with it - your heart, liver and your kidneys and all that - and they are still 100 percent, they are fine.</p>

<p>'So at the moment they go, "You are too healthy, go and enjoy yourself. And come back in six months."'</p>

<p>Sad: In her reality series My Crazy Life, Katie shared a glimpse of her socially distanced visit to her mum, with the pair only able to see each other through a window</p>

<p>Katie has also said when the family first discovered Amy's diagnosis, she tried to offer her mum a lung.</p>

<p>'She wouldn't ever let me because I have kids but it's not that easy. There's not that many on the transplant list, they have to wait until you're nearly dead,' she said.</p>

<p>Amy told the panel she was hoping to go on a research drug because it 'wouldn't make her condition any worse.'</p>
