<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With international leisure travel pretty much verboten this year, I was keen to rediscover what the UK has to offer its own in terms of luxury hospitality.</p>

<p>Let’s face it, our country is no longer held up for its customer service, so I was unsure anywhere that wasn’t a heavily-financed London establishment on our sceptred isle would be able to keep up with foreign competition.</p>

<p>Enter The 25, which snagged the 2020 Visit England B&amp;B of the Year award and has been voted the world’s best B&amp;B two years running by Tripadvisor in its annual Travellers’ Choice Awards (this year and last).</p>

<p>The 25 has been voted the world’s best B&amp;B two years running by Tripadvisor in its annual Travellers’ Choice Awards - and has a clean sweep of five-star reviews</p>

<p>Run by Andy and Julian Banner-Price, The 25 is now a six-bedroom establishment (reduced from 10 bedrooms when they took it over five years ago) with each room or suite decorated differently and distinctly </p>

<p>William writes of The 25's decor: 'I can’t pretend it was to my taste, or anywhere near it.' Pictured is the Torre Suite</p>

<p>The thing is, the label ‘world’s best’ always raises a suspicious eyebrow.</p>

<p>For the cynical, it’s a moniker that primes the recipient for a fall…</p>

<p>The bed and breakfast sits on a fairly nondescript avenue in... Torquay.</p>

<p>Conventionally, very little about Torquay says ‘world’s best’ unless you want a prime choice of littoral tattoo parlours, beer-battered coach parties and coffee shops that close too early.</p>

<p>The Broadsands Room comes with an ensuite that features a stunning claw-foot bathtub</p>

<p>William's room was the Shoalstone Suite, which has 'glittered feature walls' and 'a catalogue of amenities'</p>

<p>My drive to the world’s best B&amp;B was made very comfortable thanks to Virtuo, which is regenerating the rental car industry. I collected a thoroughly sanitised Mercedes A-Class from a nearby contact-free collection point to my house. No paper-work, no-hassle, and competitively priced. </p>

<p>A Virtuo Mercedes A-Class</p>

<p>But, according to a staggering 771 - and counting - ‘excellent’ reviews on Tripadvisor, I was in for a reality check.</p>

<p>Run by Andy and Julian Banner-Price, The 25 is now a six-bedroom establishment (reduced from 10 bedrooms when they took it over five years ago) with each room or suite decorated differently and distinctly.</p>

<p>I can’t pretend it was to my taste, or anywhere near it. </p>

<p>Though I’m sure the chaps would probably think my own soft furnishing preferences and choice of wall art a tad dull. </p>

<p>They’re certainly worlds removed from glittered feature walls and an un-dressed mannequin lamp that gave me a body-confidence issue by checkout.</p>

<p>Come sunset my room was ablaze with neon blue hues which, coupled with the complimentary Elemis toiletries in the bathroom, made me feel like I was on a BA night flight bound for Tokyo.</p>

<p>Alas, when I woke, I was still in Torquay.</p>

<p>Once I looked beyond the décor and surface decoration it was quite obvious these hoteliers have gone not just the extra mile but an extra 26 miles to give a service most five-star London hotels fail to offer.</p>

<p>The attention to detail was pathologically perfect.</p>

<p>The tiling in the bathroom is a love-letter to geometry - everything lines up in each spotless nook and sterilised cranny. </p>

<p>The bedding is pressed to within an inch of its life and the towels fluffier than Joan Collins’s best party wig.</p>

<p>'The attention to detail was pathologically perfect,' enthuses William. 'The bedding is pressed to within an inch of its life.' Pictured is the Shoalstone Suite</p>

<p>'An un-dressed mannequin lamp [pictured] gave me a body-confidence issue by checkout,' says William</p>

<p>Each room has a catalogue of amenities such as iPads, Amazon Alexas, smart TVs with Netflix, hair straighteners, blackout curtains, high-speed Wi-Fi (I got a 72MB download speed), air conditioning, Dyson fans, heated mist-free bathroom mirrors, to name only some.</p>

<p>My own suite – the Shoalstone - had a choice of three televisions, including one in the shower.</p>

<p>I can’t forget to mention the daily carousel of delicious homemade treats. My visit began with the immediate offering of Andy’s fudge.</p>

<p>'The tiling in the bathroom is a love-letter to geometry,' writes William of his Shoalstone ensuite (pictured). 'Everything lines up in each spotless nook and sterilised cranny'</p>

<p>In-room amenities include iPads, Amazon Alexas, smart TVs with Netflix, hair straighteners, blackout curtains, high-speed Wi-Fi and heated mist-free bathroom mirrors. Pictured is the Shoalstone Suite</p>

<p>'Come sunset my room was ablaze with neon blue hues, which made me feel like I was on a BA night flight'</p>

<p>Breakfast is served downstairs in a room decorated more in-line with a conventional Torquay guest house, although oddly I did start to miss busts of sunglass-wearing zebras and hidden strip lighting.</p>

<p>Ordering from the à la carte menu (the buffet’s rightly off due to the ol’ corona) I chose two poached eggs on toast, and coffee - deceptively simple and so often served incorrectly.</p>

<p>The Colombian filter coffee (my favourite - Americanos are worse than dishwater) came in a silver pot with just enough for three cups.</p>

<p>The crustless toast had gone to the same Swiss finishing school as the bathroom tiling - each slice and egg a perfect, happy twin of its partner. Poirot, the crime hero created by Torquay’s most famous writer, would have greatly approved.</p>

<p>The 25's breakfasts are geometrically eye-catching, as the image on the left reveals. On the right - The 25's Viennese Whirls</p>

<p>William is hugely impressed with the breakfast, which is served 'downstairs in a room decorated more in-line with a conventional Torquay guest house'</p>

<p>You would think the B&amp;B employed an army of staff to maintain the immaculate housekeeping and be across renovations and touch-ups. But, no - everything is done by the gentlemen themselves, with no help at all.</p>

<p>They cook, they clean, they iron, they paint, they design, they build. They’re the two-man answer to the boys from Queer Eye with an added spritz of Alex Polizzi.</p>

<p>As I bid farewell to Andy and Julian I was presented with a goodie bag of snacks and sustenance to keep me going on my journey east. The only other hotel I’ve had anything similar to this was at a boutique hotel in St Tropez. A final, thoughtful, parting touch from the gentlemen, who plan to run online courses next year to share their winning philosophy and techniques.</p>

<p>There is no army of staff keeping The 25 spick and span - Andy and Julian do everything themselves</p>

<p>The Goodrington Room has 'a luscious teal and mulberry colour scheme, over-sized lamps and a seating area', says The 25's website</p>

<p>In the Oddicombe Room 'a giant orange gerbera makes a bold statement as a contemporary feature wall in this quiet rear-facing room', say Andy and Julian</p>

<p>Back in London I couldn’t help but feel pleasantly surprised I’d been converted to the charms of the famous B&amp;B.</p>

<p>Perhaps the clues were there before I arrived - with two weeks to go until my stay I was sent a list of recommended restaurants in the area and was told they would take care of a reservation if I’d like to pick an establishment and time. How many other B&amp;Bs offer such an efficient concierge service?</p>

<p>Isn’t it rather wonderful to think that, despite the grim experiences we have all repeatedly had with British hospitality, there is a shining, sequinned beacon of perfection, modestly soaring above the competition?</p>

<p>It’s just a shame it’s in Torquay.</p>
