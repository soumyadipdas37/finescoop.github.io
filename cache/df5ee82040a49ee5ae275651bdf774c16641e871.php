<p>Heartwarming: Sharing the photo on his Instagram account, Sean celebrated the fact that they were all together with their grandfather after several years of estrangement </p>

<p>'The entire West Coast is burning, but if the O’Neals can reconcile, truly anything is possible #Reconciliation #Forgiveness #Wholeness #Love #FAMILY.'</p>

<p>At 10, Tatum became the youngest person to win a competitive Academy Award for her performance, alongside her father, in the 1973 comedy-drama Paper Moon. </p>

<p>Tatum and Ryan, who have both had battles with substance abuse, have had a famously volatile relationship that resulted in a falling out that lasted nearly 25 years.</p>

<p>They began to restore their broken relationship in 2011, which was captured, in part, in the short-lived Oprah Winfrey Network series Ryan and Tatum: The O'Neals.</p>

<p>The way they were: Actor Ryan and Tatum are pictured with the actress' children back in 2003</p>

<p>However, the volatility of their relationship appeared to have bubbled to the surface once again, as Tatum revealed in 2018 that she wanted to reconcile with her father.</p>

<p>She said on Megyn Kelly Today, she said: 'I want to say to my dad, if you're watching this, I love you. I've always loved you and forgiveness is the best policy.'</p>

<p>The veteran actress continued: 'I don't want to hold on to anger and resentments. I want to have a free, happy and guilt-free life.</p>

<p>'My dad did a lot of good for me and I have to just respect his life and his process. Maybe someday he and I will have a moment where we [reconcile].'</p>

<p>Milestone: At 10, Tatum became the youngest person to win a competitive Academy Award for her performance, alongside her father, in the 1973 comedy-drama Paper Moon</p>

<p>One of Tatum and Ryan's most bizarre encounters occurred in 2009, when they both attended the funeral for his former partner Farrah Fawcett.</p>

<p>Ryan admitted to flirting with his daughter - whose mother is Joanna Moore - at the service without realising who she was.</p>

<p>He explained: 'I had just put the casket in the hearse and was watching it drive away, when a beautiful blond woman comes up and embraces me.</p>

<p>'I said to her, "You have a drink on you? You have a car?" She said, "Daddy, it's me - Tatum!"'</p>

<p>Sad: Despite a phenomenal start to her career, Tatum endured many years of substance abuse</p>

<p>The A Bridge Too Far actor admitted that the surreal incident epitomised their complex relationship.</p>

<p>Ryan - who was estranged from his daughter for decades - said: 'That's our relationship in a nutshell. You make of it what you will.'</p>

<p>In her 2004 autobiography, A Paper Life, Tatum alleged that she was molested by her father’s drug dealer when she was aged just 12.</p>

<p>Among the bombshell claims in her tome were allegations that she endured physical and emotional abuse at the hands of her father, blaming his own drug use.</p>

<p>However, her famous dad denied the allegations, saying in a statement: 'It is a sad day when malicious lies are told in order to become a "bestseller".' </p>

<p>Reaching out: In February, Tatum sent her father, Ryan, an emotional Valentine's Day message</p>

<p>However, things have evidently been far more harmonious between the pair, as Tatum sent her dad a  Valentine's Day message amid his health woes.</p>

<p>The actress shared an adorable photo of herself and her father both laughing hysterically while sitting next to each other on the front stoop of a home. </p>

<p>'I found a picture of us in better times,' she began in her lengthy and emotional caption.</p>

<p>'I want to tell you that I am me because of you, and I mean all my good qualities,' the former child star continued.</p>

<p>'The way I have taught my children the joy of irony and how to love. The ability to laugh ourselves. Love of movies.' </p>

<p>Family support: Tatum was at her father's side when he received treatment for his heart condition days earlier in Los Angeles</p>

<p>And then in a reference to their two-decade estrangement, she added: 'I wish things could be different that I could have made choices you could be more proud of. I have to live with myself and take pride in the woman I am today for better or worse.'</p>

<p>She ended heartfelt message by confessing that all she wanted was 'for you to feel my love for you and know there is no preexisting reasons except that I love you.!! Just know that! Baby Mozart at your feet. Love your daughter.'</p>

<p>The Valentine's wishes came two days after Tatum posted a now-deleted picture of her dad looking gaunt as he received treatment for his heart while Tatum looked on. </p>

<p>'With my legendary dad !! Trying to get his heart fixed up!!,' Tatum wrote, along with two broken heart emojis and two sparkling heart emojis.</p>

<p>Tatum shares her three children with ex-husband John McEnroe, who she divorced in 1994, six years after their tied the knot. </p>
