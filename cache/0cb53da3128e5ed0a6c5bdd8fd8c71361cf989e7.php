<p>Residents from the ACT will be allowed to enter Queensland via air from 1am on September 25, the premier announced on Friday.  </p>

<p>'I have spoken with Chief Minister Andrew Barr to confirm the ACT will be removed as a hotspot,' Ms Palaszczuk said.  </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk said Canberrans will only be allowed into the Sunshine State if they haven't visited a declared hotspot in the past 14 days.</p>

<p>On Friday, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced residents from the ACT will be allowed to travel to Queensland from 1am on September 25</p>

<p>'We'll work with ACT authorities to make sure appropriate checks are in place at Canberra Airport for people flying into Queensland,' Ms Palaszczuk said. </p>

<p>'This is another step towards ensuring Queensland's economy rebounds, not the virus.'  </p>

<p>Health Minister Steven Miles encouraged ACT residents to choose Queensland for their next holiday. </p>

<p>'Queensland is good to go,' he said. </p>

<p>'This is time to coincide with the school holidays in the ACT. A great chance to come and visit friends and relatives, go to the reef, go to one of our wonderful tourism hotspots.</p>

<p>'This is great news for the ACT and recognition for the fact that they have been sometime without any cases.' </p>

<p>Residents from the ACT will be allowed to enter Queensland via air from 1am on September 25, the premier announced on Friday</p>

<p>No coronavirus cases were recorded in the Sunshine State overnight and it has been eight days since it had a case of community transmission. </p>

<p>The easing of border controls comes after Sarah Caisip, a 26-year-old Canberra nurse, was denied a permit from the Queensland government to enter the state to see her dying father. </p>

<p>Health officials stopped Ms Caisip from leaving her Brisbane hotel quarantine last week to grieve with her 11-year-old sister Isobel Prendergast and her mother Myrna Prendergast. </p>

<p>She was only allowed to view her father's body 20 minutes after the funeral dressed in personal protective equipment.  </p>

<p>Thursday marked ten weeks since the ACT recorded a new coronavirus infection.</p>

<p>New South Wales and Victoria remain COVID-19 hotspots in the eyes of the Queensland government. </p>
