<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Young parents found dead at their home in Ohio in a suspected murder-suicide were sending adoring messages to each-other just weeks before the fatal shooting. </p>

<p>Zachary Starr, 29, and wife Mikki, 27, who had two children, were found dead at their family home in the town of Lima on September 16.</p>

<p>Police say they were called by relatives who noticed 'alarming' posts on Zachary's social media, and believe he shot Mikki before turning the weapon on himself. </p>

<p>But publicly-available posts on the couple's Facebook accounts paint a very different picture - as the pair showered each other with compliments and loving messages as recently as seven weeks before being found dead.</p>

<p>Zachary and Mikki Starr, 29 and 27 (pictured with their two children), were found shot dead at their home in Lima, Ohio, last week in what police believe was a murder suicide </p>

<p>Just weeks prior to the shooting, the couple were posting adoring messages to each-other online, including these comments underneath Mikki's profile picture</p>

<p>Zachary told his wife that he was 'grateful for our little tribe' just three months before police suspect he shot both of them dead</p>

<p>One such exchange was visible underneath Mikki's profile picture, which she changed on July 26 to show a picture of the two arm-in-arm in front of a lake.</p>

<p>'Damn, you are so beautiful baby!!!!' Zach wrote alongside a flurry of love-heart emojis, beating Mikki's best friend to get the first comment.</p>

<p>'I love you so much!' she replied, before he responded: 'I love you so much babe!' </p>

<p>The couple also 'liked' each-other's responses with a love heart.</p>

<p>A month before those posts, on June 21, Zach had uploaded an image to his page of Mikki and their son playing on swings in a yard while he stood nearby.</p>

<p>Mikki responded by posting 'I love you' along with love-hearts, to which he responded: 'I love you beautiful and I’m so grateful for our little tribe!!!!'</p>

<p>Again, the couple had 'liked' each-other's posts with additional hearts.</p>

<p>Police are still investigating the deaths, and have yet given a motive for the shooting, or disclosed contents of the 'alarming' social media posts.</p>

<p>However, detectives have said that a preliminary investigation has concluded the deaths were the result of murder-suicide. </p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Jason Garlock, who is leading the investigation, said: 'We had information from family members that there were some social media messages that gave us the indication that's what we're probably looking at right now.'</p>

<p>A year ago, Zachary had updated his Facebook page with a post gushing about his 'beautiful wife', before the couple exchanged loving messages in the comments section</p>

<p>Further social media posts revealed that Mikki went to high school in the small town of Elida, six miles outside of Lima, and had then attended Rhodes State College, on the other side of town.</p>

<p>She graduated from there in 2019 and went to work as an endoscopy technician at Mercy Health-St. Rita's Medical Center, also in Lima. </p>

<p>Zachary's Facebook page claims the two met in 2012, when they would have been aged 21 and 19, and married on June 24, 2017.</p>

<p>They have a son - Ryker, aged seven - and a daughter - Ryah, aged just 18 months.  </p>

<p>The couple were also expecting a second son, Greyson, though suffered a stillbirth in July 2016.  </p>

<p>Tributes have been paid to Mikki on the Facebook page of her cousin - Tracey Anne Davis.</p>

<p>Ms Davis wrote 'This is heartbreaking I cannot believe this.</p>

<p>'My heart is breaking. This is my cousin Mikki Starr and I am asking for everyone to keep my family in your prayers TIA my poor auntie.'</p>

<p>Police officers outside the couple's home on West Ford Avenue, Lima, after the shooting</p>

<p>Officers were called to the home (pictured) by family members who noticed 'alarming' posts on Zachary's social media pages</p>

<p>Jessica Lynn Davis added 'So sorry my thoughts and prayers are with you and your family during this difficult time.</p>

<p>While Jennifer Neal said 'Such a tragedy. Praying for you and your family.'</p>

<p>Mikki's death is the seventh homicide from a shooting or a stabbing investigated this year in Lima.</p>

<p>There was ten murders in the city in the whole of last year, which was a ten year high.</p>

<p>Both bodies were sent to the Lucas County Coroner's Office for autopsies.</p>

<p>Mikki's funeral is on Wednesday from 1pm at Chiles-Laman Funeral &amp; Cremation Services, Shawnee Chapel. The burial will follow at Pike Run Cemetery.  </p>
