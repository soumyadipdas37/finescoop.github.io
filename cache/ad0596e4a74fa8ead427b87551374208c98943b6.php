<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A white woman has landed herself in hot water with indigenous advocates after buying a didgeridoo for her partner for Father's Day. </p>

<p>Social media influencer Sarah Stevenson, known by her one million followers as Sarah's Day, gave her partner Kurt Tilse the wind instrument as a gift from their one-year-old son Fox on Sunday.</p>

<p>The father shared a photo on Instagram of him playing the didgeridoo, also known as the Yadaki by some Aboriginal communities, for his son at their Sydney home.</p>

<p>'Thanks mate, such a great Fathers Day gift! What a special gift rich with so much culture,' Tilse wrote.</p>

<p>'I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the Dharawal speaking people who are the Traditional Custodians of the Sutherland Shire.' </p>

<p>Social media influencer Sarah Stevenson (pictured) has copped backlash after buying her partner a yadaki, another term for didgeridoo, for her partner for father's day</p>

<p>But the post caught the attention of Indigenous advocates and followers who accused the couple of cultural appropriation, decrying the gift as 'inappropriate and disrespectful'. </p>

<p>'I wish this was a picture of you reading an Indigenous children’s book to your son. So many ways to appreciate First Nation’s culture that isn’t appropriation,' one woman wrote. </p>

<p>Another added:'So disappointing.'  </p>

<p>Sharing the image on their Instagram page, educational Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander group <?php echo e('@'); ?>blakbusiness slammed the pair for purchasing the Yadaki from a non-Indigenous seller. </p>

<p>'Non-Indigenous people owning or profiting from our culture is very problematic as it reflects a history of carpet-bagging and takes economic opportunities away from our mob,' the post read.</p>

<p>The group also shared images of comments they wrote addressing their concerns on the photo, that they claim were later deleted. </p>

<p>'Turning off comments is silencing Aboriginal voices and perspectives,' they wrote to the couple. </p>

<p>The fitness blogger's partner Kurt Tilse uploaded an image (pictured) of himself playing the Aboriginal instrument for his one-year-old son Fox to Instagram on Sunday</p>

<p>It is not the first time the fitness blogger has come under fire. </p>

<p>In May, the Youtuber was blasted with complaints, including death threats, for cultural appropriation after she appeared in a promotional video for her new active wear range with colourful split braids. </p>

<p>She promptly issued an apology video saying she was unaware the hairstyle had cultural links to the black community and would not have used it had she known.  </p>

<p>Other photos shared by <?php echo e('@'); ?>blakbusiness on Monday showed messages the group had sent her following the first incident offering to educate her on cultural appropriation, that Stevenson never returned. </p>

<p>Tilse responded by defending the purchase in his Instagram story, writing his intentions had been misinterpreted.</p>

<p>'I only want to glorify the rich culture that is attached to this country and the land,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'I am proud to be Australian and want to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land.' </p>

<p>Instagram page <?php echo e('@'); ?>blakbusiness shared a comment the group wrote on the photo, claiming several of their comments had been deleted</p>

<p>Cultural appropriation is the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society. </p>

<p>The Instagram star also copped criticism last November during an attempt to raise money for bushfire victims.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old announced she would donate $1 from every product she sold, sparking outrage from scores of her more than 2million fans who thought the small percentage was a 'cop out'.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sarah Stevenson and <?php echo e('@'); ?>blakbusiness for comment.  </p>
