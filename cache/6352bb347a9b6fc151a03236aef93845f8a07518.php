<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Three police officers showed up at a young mother's house to interrogate her about a Facebook post telling Melburnians to go for their daily walk.</p>

<p>Megan Kira, 27, called on everyone to go for their hour of exercise allowed under Stage Four lockdown at 5pm every day in their local park.</p>

<p>The mother-of-four's post on Facebook and Instagram positioned the walk as a protest against coronavirus restrictions amid demonstrations in Dadnenong.</p>

<p>'Dandenong took the first step. Now it's time we all follow in their footsteps,' her post began, followed by eight issues to protest about.</p>

<p>Megan Kira's post on Facebook and Instagram positioned the walk as a protest against coronavirus restrictions amid demonstrations in Dadnenong</p>

<p>Just hours later, three officers showed up at her door in Clyde North - not far from Dandenong - asking what her intentions were.</p>

<p>Refusing to come to the door and instead talking through a window, Ms Kira asked how the officers tracked her down as she was 'not in the system'.</p>

<p>'I have no driver's license, no passport... so how did you find me?' she said.</p>

<p>The officers explained that since she had previous contact with police, her details were registered in their database.</p>

<p>'We're here about a Facebook post you put up earlier today about asking people to meet up at the park across the road,' the lead officer said.</p>

<p>Just hours later, three officers showed up at her door asking what her intentions were, concerned she was inciting people to illegally gather in groups</p>

<p>Ms Kira claimed she was only going for a walk with her young son, not a group, and just wanted to let people know they can go for a walk</p>

<p>Ms Kira replied: 'I said go to your local park which is actually allowed, and to go for an hour, which is allowed. I didn't say to meet people, I said go for a walk.'</p>

<p>Police explained they were monitoring social media due to the Dandenong protests, and asked what her intentions were.</p>

<p>Ms Kira claimed she was only going for a walk with her young son, not a group, and just wanted to let people know they can go for a walk.</p>

<p>'If your intention was to go for a walk, no problem,' the policeman replied.</p>

<p>'But if it can be shown that your intention was to promote to have a group of people attend a park in contravention of the lockdown orders, you can actually be charged with an offence called incitement.'</p>

<p>Police have vowed to quash protests against the Stage Four lockdown, which still has at least 11 days to go, and have arrested several organisers.</p>

<p>Melburnians can only exercise for one hour a day with one other person up to 5km from their home, and anyone encouraging people to break these rules can be charged with incitement. </p>

<p>Ms Kira's social media is littered with anti-lockdown and coronavirus conspiracy theory posts, including calling the virus a 'plandemic' and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews 'Hitler'</p>

<p>A day later, her friend Rosana Felise was arrested as the pair went for a walk around the neighbourhood with Ms Kira in a Guy Fawkes mask</p>

<p>Ms Kira later went for her 5pm walk, while wearing a mask, as police cars patrolled the area looking for anyone breaching lockdown.</p>

<p>'You can't even put up a post encouraging people to go for a walk to the playground without cops showing up at your door,' she said as she walked.</p>

<p>A day later, her friend Rosana Felise was arrested as the pair went for a walk around the neighbourhood with Ms Kira in a Guy Fawkes mask.</p>

<p>Ms Felise was not wearing a mask so police approached and asked for her details. When she refused and claimed she didn't need to, she was arrested.</p>

<p>Ms Kira's social media is littered with anti-lockdown and coronavirus conspiracy theory posts, including calling the virus a 'plandemic' and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews 'Hitler'.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews is due to finally release a plan on Sunday to get Victoria out of lockdown, after three consecutive days of less than 70 new cases.</p>
