<p>'I always thought, "This might not work," I just became really laid back about the whole thing. I just felt numb to the whole thing.' </p>

<p>She had to change her way of thinking following the devastating disappointment of her first miscarriage as she recalled: 'You start thinking about baby names and looking at clothes and things, and then it was just sort of gone… at seven weeks.  </p>

<p>'It was such a massive shock as quite naively I thought, "I'm going to have a baby"... It's so hard, what do you say to people?</p>

<p>'I don't want them to feel uncomfortable about it. Although I felt so heartbroken, I just thought "I'll brush that under the rug"…</p>

<p>'It's hard because, are you supposed to grieve for something that's the size of a grain of rice? People believe different things, but for me it was a baby from the minute it was conceived.'</p>
