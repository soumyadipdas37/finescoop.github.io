<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Samsung is working on several new camera modes that may be included in future phones according to code uncovered by XDA-Developers. </p>

<p>Researchers analyzing code inside Samsung devices say they uncovered evidence of several nascent modes like 'Director's View' which lets users cycle between different lenses on their phones and also allows them to 'lock on' to a subjects that they're recording, keeping them in focus.</p>

<p>XDA suggests that the feature will also operate similarly to the iPhone 11's Filmic Pro which lets users record out of two different phone cameras at the same time.</p>

<p> New camera modes would take phones like Samsung's Galaxy Note 10 (pictured above) to a new level and parrot some feature included in Apple's flagship, the iPhone 11 Pro</p>

<p>The idea is that - with multiple iPhone's - once can feasibly use the feature to record professional-grade multi-cam video.</p>

<p>XDA also found evidence for a 'Night Hyperlapse' mode which, although there wasn't much additional information, suggests that users would be able to use its existing 'Hyperlapse' feature to take time-lapse videos in low-light settings.</p>

<p>Night Hyperlapse may also be complemented by a 'Single Take Photo' mode that allows users to pan their cameras from side to side while the camera takes multiple pictures and short videos.</p>

<p>Once compiled, XDA says users will be able to view the assortment of videos and photos they just took.</p>

<p>Lastly, XDA says it uncovered evidence of a feature called 'Custom Filter' that lets users 'select a picture you like the look of from your Gallery, then save it as a filter.'</p>

<p>While it's unclear exactly how this particular mode would function, details uncovered by XDA suggest that it will be able to mimic the features of another photo and apply them to other pictures.</p>

<p>For instance, if one likes the color, saturation, brightness, and contrast of a previously taken picture, they could use 'Custom Filter' to apply those same settings to an image taken after the fact.</p>

<p>According to XDA, it's not totally clear whether the features will actually find their way into phones, despite the existence of code that would allow Samsung to activate the feature.</p>
