<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alisson Becker and Thiago Alcantara are both injury doubts for Liverpool ahead of their Premier League clash with Arsenal on Monday evening. </p>

<p>The Reds pair have been unable to train with the rest of the squad in recent days, and manager Jurgen Klopp is reportedly awaiting an update on their availability. </p>

<p>Liverpool's back-up keeper Adrian is ready to fill in for Alisson, should the Brazilian fail to recover in time to feature at Anfield, but Klopp is prepared to give his No1 time before selecting his first XI. </p>

<p>Alisson Becker could miss Liverpool's home clash with Arsenal due to an unspecified issue</p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara is also likely to miss out at Anfield after he did not feature in training</p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara joined Liverpool from Bayern Munich this summer in a £20m deal, and the Spaniard has been ruled out of Liverpool's third league game of the season due to an unspecified issue, according to The Sunday Times. </p>

<p>The midfielder made his Liverpool debut last week when the reigning champions recorded a 2-0 away victory over Chelsea thanks to Sadio Mane's brace. </p>

<p> Jordan Henderson and Joel Matip have already been ruled out of Monday's game due to more significant injuries, but Joe Gomez is available after making his return at Stamford Bridge.</p>
