<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho had doubts over Tanguy Ndombele's attitude but says he has full belief in him now after the Frenchman rescued Spurs from an embarrassing night in the Europa League.</p>

<p>Ndombele scored the winner as Spurs needed two goals in the final 10 minutes to beat Bulgarian side Lokomotiv Plovdiv 2-1 in the second round of qualifying.</p>

<p>The Frenchman netted with five minutes left after Harry Kane's penalty had cancelled out Georgi Mindev's opener as Plovdiv threatened to leave Mourinho's men red-faced.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has praised Tanguy Ndombele after he bailed out Spurs in the Europa League</p>

<p>The Spurs boss admits he had some doubts, but now has full belief in the record signing</p>

<p>Mourinho and Ndombele have not had the best of relationships since the manager came to the club in November as he became increasingly frustrated with the club-record signing's fitness and attitude, speaking out publicly against him in the media.</p>

<p>But things look to be back on the right track now, with Mourinho saying he is confident Ndombele can perform for Spurs.</p>

<p>'Tanguy is in a process of evolution,' Mourinho said. 'Last season he wasn't. Last season he was stuck in a situation where I couldn't see evolution.</p>

<p>'In this moment he's training very, very well. He's recovering from his injury, he's recovering physically and today he gave us what we needed in this last 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The Lokomotiv Plovdiv players celebrate after surprisingly going ahead against Tottenham</p>

<p>'In this moment, I believe in Tanguy. I never doubted his quality. Never. I doubted in some moments his motivation and commitment and professional attitude.</p>

<p>'In this moment I believe in him.</p>

<p>'Today we made this decision together to not start the game because he also feels that he needs a bit more but in this moment I think that Tanguy can do well for us.'</p>

<p>Ndombele offered more than just the winning goal, though, as he looked to be incisive and direct with his passing - a trait Spurs had been missing in the opening hour.</p>

<p>They did miss some chances to go ahead in the first half but were staring at an embarrassing defeat when Mindev scored from a corner.</p>

<p>Spurs were handed a lifeline in the 79th minute when Dinis Costa deliberately handled Ben Davies' header on the line and was dismissed, with Birsent Karagaren also sent off after receiving a yellow card for digging a hole in the penalty spot with his foot.</p>

<p>Two red cards and a Harry Kane penalty later, Tottenham Hotspur were back in the match</p>

<p>Ndombele then converted Lucas Moura's cross to seal the comeback.</p>

<p>'Of course when they scored it was a moment to dream and a moment for us to fear for our future in the competition,' Mourinho said.</p>

<p>'We knew that if we scored a goal in the first half it would be a totally different game.</p>

<p>'Great emotion, good for the players to feel the dramatic situation of 10-15 minutes to go and losing 1-0 and then the last feeling of course is to win and go to the next round and the happiness of that.</p>

<p>'They made life difficult, especially with their attitude. It was a big game for them and they showed that. They gave everything, absolutely everything.'</p>
