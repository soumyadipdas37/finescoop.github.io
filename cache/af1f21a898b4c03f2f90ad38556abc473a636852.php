<p>Back together! This Morning hosts Holly Willoughby, 39, and Phillip Schofield, 58, appeared 'side by side' on Monday after clever camera tweaks brought them 'virtually together'</p>

<p>In a sweet virtual reunion the pair even high-fived despite sitting two metres apart on opposite ends of the desk.  </p>

<p>Holly looked radiant in a cream printed midi dress and wore her blonde glossy tresses in loose waves over her shoulders. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Phillip opted for a light blue shirt and appeared delighted to be virtually sat next to his co-host again. </p>

<p>Reality: Holly looked radiant in a cream printed midi dress and wore her blonde glossy tresses in loose waves over her shoulders</p>

<p>Opening the show, Phillip said: 'Finally after six long months Holly and I are sitting together side by side.  </p>

<p>'Ah sort of, however, our very clever team,' Holly said. </p>

<p>However Phillip cheekily added how the TV duo should have not said anything for a 'couple of seconds' to stir up reaction on social media.  </p>

<p>Social distancing: Phillip cheekily added how the TV duo should have not said anything for a 'couple of seconds' to stir up reaction on social media</p>

<p>He said: 'We should leave it for just a couple of seconds so Twitter can get really angry. We will give you just enough time to complain on Twitter. </p>

<p>Looking at her co-host in the camera reflection, Holly said: 'Ah there you are - there you are! Little high five!</p>

<p>She added: 'Our very clever team have worked their magic and managed to get rid of that two metre gap, look this is where we really are, to bring us virtually together isn't that nice?' </p>

<p>Anniversary: The TV presenters also celebrated 11 years of hosting This Morning together after Holly joined in 2009 replacing Fern Britton when the show re-launched</p>

<p>It comes as fans congratulated the pair on Twitter and thanked them for the past 11 years. </p>

<p>One wrote: 'Congratulations on your 11th anniversary you made us laugh and cry and here's to 11 more years.'</p>

<p>Another penned: 'Eleven years ago Holly started on This Morning. Thank you so much for the laughs and the tears over the years!! It's incredible having you on the show and it wouldn't be the same without you.' </p>

<p>A third added: 'Happy 11 year anniversary. Here's to 11 years more. Thanks for all the laughs.' </p>

<p>Support: Fans congratulated the pair on Twitter and thanked them for the past 11 years</p>

<p>In May Holly admitted that after she took a break from This Morning for half-term, she was dubious about returning to the studios amid the COVID-19 pandemic.  </p>

<p>The presenter was speaking about the Fear Of Going Out - or FOGO - specifically after the UK started to ease some civilians back to their workplaces.</p>

<p>She said: 'It's the fear of the unknown, and not knowing what your workplace will be like. When we were off for a week on half-term, the longer you are away the more anxious you are about coming back in.'  </p>

<p>Beginnings: Holly and Phillip hosting This Morning in November 2009 shortly after the show re-launched </p>
