<p>But now the reality TV star, who confirmed his split from Angie in July, claims he was almost chosen as The Bachelor months before meeting his ex. </p>

<p>Carlin, 32, claims he went through all the auditioning and vetting processes to become Channel 10's suitor, but scientist Matt Agnew secured the coveted role.</p>

<p>Carlin Steritt (pictured) was almost The Bachelor before being 'fast-tracked' to appear on Angie Kent's Bachelorette season in 2019</p>

<p>In a YouTube interview for Big Brother star Sophie Budack's talk show 'Beyond The White Room', Carlin disclosed his history with the show's application process.</p>

<p>Carlin said when Warner Bros. put out a callout to find the 2019 Bachelor, the owner and boss of the F45 gym he worked at nominated him.</p>

<p>'He did it behind my back. I didn't ask him to do it,' he told Sophie over video chat.</p>

<p>What could have been: Carlin said when Warner Bros put out a large callout to find the 2019 Bachelor, the boss of the F45 gym he worked at nominated him. Matt Agnew (pictured) was later chosen as the suitor</p>

<p>'I met with a lot of the casting directors and producers': Carlin (left) said he progressed in his audition for The Bachelor, but was unsuccessful. Pictured with Big Brother's Sophie Budack</p>

<p>'I got an audition for The Bachelor and from that process - and I didn't get The Bachelor - but I met with a lot of the casting directors and producers. They sort of got to know who I was.</p>

<p>'So when The Bachelorette came to be they pretty much gave me a call and said "hey, did you want to just apply for this?" and I said "sure!"' he added.</p>

<p>Carlin said after he did the group interview, his application was 'just all fast tracked from there'.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Channel 10 for comment. </p>

<p>'When The Bachelorette came to be they pretty much gave me a call': Carlin said he was offered the opportunity to audition for Angie's season and was 'fast-tracked' for the show</p>

<p>Carlin never addressed his past application process on the show, likely due to how Angie reacted to another contestant's similar confession.</p>

<p>During a group date dinner party, the final four men were asked if they had applied for previous seasons of the dating franchise.</p>

<p>Runner-up Timm Hanly said he hasn't, Jackson Garlick confessed he had applied for Georgia Love's season in 2016, and Ryan Anderson admitted he had originally auditioned for Ali Oetjen's season the year prior.</p>

<p>The response irked Angie, as he had previously lied by telling her he would never have signed up for the show if it had been anyone else.  </p>

<p>Angie fumed at the time, exclaiming: 'So I've got Ali's sloppy seconds?!' </p>

<p>Carlin's answer was not aired at the time. </p>

<p>Secret's out: Carlin never addressed his past application process on the show, likely due to how Angie reacted to Ryan Anderson's similar confession at a group date dinner party</p>

<p>Carlin and Angie announced their break-up on July 1, after weeks of speculation they had quietly called it quits.   </p>

<p>The 32-year-old personal trainer told the How to Life podcast this month that his  relationship with Angie began to fall apart after he discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly.  </p>

<p>Carlin didn't blame Angie for his insecurity, however, and told the podcast hosts he was 'getting therapy' to address his problems.    </p>

<p>Angie also broke her silence on her split from Carlin this month, saying their relationship fizzled out after they left the reality TV 'bubble'.</p>

<p>The former Gogglebox star, 30, told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday that their real-life romance was underwhelming compared to the intense sexual chemistry they shared during filming last year.</p>

<p>Done: Carlin and Angie announced their break-up on July 1, after weeks of speculation they had quietly called it quits</p>
