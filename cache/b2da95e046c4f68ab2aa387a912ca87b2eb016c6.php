<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Western Australia has slightly relaxed its tough border rules.</p>

<p>From Monday 5 October travellers from Victoria with permission to enter will be allowed to quarantine at an 'appropriate premise' such as a home instead of a hotel for 14 days.</p>

<p>However, the list of reasons for entering from Victoria remains extremely limited. </p>

<p>Also from 5 October, more people from NSW will be able to enter WA as the exemption list is expanded.</p>

<p>The change means NSW residents will be subject to the same rules as residents from all other jurisdictions except Victoria.</p>

<p>Anyone entering WA has to undertake 14 days of quarantine with a Covid test on the 11th day.  </p>

<p>'We expect this change will allow for more exempt travel to occur from New South Wales, similar to our original hard border arrangement in place from April 5,' Premier Mark McGowan said. </p>

<p>'This is a positive step forward for our nation. We can make these adjustments to our border controls because of the positive results we have recently seen over east.' </p>

<p>Mr McGowan, who faces an election on 31 March, said WA's hard border will remain in place until community transmission is under control in all states. </p>

<p>'Right now Europe and Britain are experiencing a second wave which is worse than the first,' he said. </p>

<p>'Western Australia is the envy of the world. Our health and our economy is in the best possible position considering what is happening around us. That is why a cautious approach is necessary. </p>

<p>'As always, like everything, we will continue to monitor the situation over east. But until we have confidence that community spread is under control, the border will stay in place.</p>

<p>'I have been clear and consistent about this. We look to our friends in Victoria and we hope that as they come out of lockdown, we continue to see community spread get under control. So then as a nation we can continue on the same positive path out of Covid-19.' </p>
