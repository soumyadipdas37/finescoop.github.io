<p>Posting to Instagram Stories, the Survivor hunk made a sly reference to the infamous moment on The Bachelor when Bella claimed Irena was faking her passion for hiking just to get close to Locky.</p>

<p>'She does hike! I'm seeing it with my own eyes!' grinned Locky after placing a kiss on his ladylove's lips. </p>
