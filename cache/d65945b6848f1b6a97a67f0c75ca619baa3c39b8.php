<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A rare purebred alpine dingo named Sooty with a unique sable black coat has been discovered in rural Victoria. </p>

<p>Sooty was just six to eight weeks old when a farmer and son discovered him huddled in the middle of dirt track in Jamieson, 190km north-east of Melbourne, in June.</p>

<p>They mistook him for a koala but eventually realised he was actually a male dingo and had likely been left to fend for himself after his mother was culled. </p>

<p>Deciding to name him Sooty because of his dark coat and in honour of the bushfires, they eventually handed him over to the Australian Dingo Foundation. </p>

<p>Experts initially believed Sooty was part-domestic dog because of his dark coat before a surprising genetic test revealed he was all dingo.    </p>

<p>Sooty the dingo (pictured) was just six to eight weeks old when a farmer and son discovered the him huddled in the middle of dirt track in Jamieson, 190 kilometres north-east of Melbourne, in June</p>

<p>UNSW dingo genetics researcher Dr Kylie Cairns tested Sooty's DNA and confirmed that he was a purebred alpine dingo. </p>

<p>'Sooty shows no evidence of domestic dog ancestry and he is a further reminder that wild Dingoes do persist in Victoria,' she said.  </p>

<p>Australian Dingo Foundation founder Lyn Watson said she is 'incredibly overjoyed' that Sooty was discovered a year after another alpine dingo was found. </p>

<p>'For 10 years Victorians have been mislead to believe that Alpine Dingoes have virtually disappeared from the Victorian landscape,' she said. </p>

<p>'So to have another wild Alpine Dingo cub, testing as pure, randomly found just a year after Wandi Dingo, is an absolute miracle.' </p>

<p>The dingo was named Sooty because of his sable black coat and in honour of the bushfires. Because of his colour, researchers initially thought he was part-domestic dog but a DNA test revealed he was actually a pure alpine dingo</p>

<p>Ms Watson said Sooty was 'found in a zone where Dingoes are actively baited, trapped and shot'.  </p>

<p>'It is likely that Sooty was orphaned and left to starve as a result of his parents being culled,' she said.       </p>

<p>Dingoes are considered a threatened species in Australia and are divided into three main ecotypes depending on their environment; desert, tropical and alpine. </p>

<p>Of the three types, alpine dingoes are the most vulnerable since they live in eastern seaboard areas, which is also where 80 per cent of the Australian population lives.   </p>

<p>Unlike their tropical and desert counterparts, alpine dingoes grow a second thicker coat of fur during the autumn to stay warm in high altitudes during the winter. </p>

<p>They are mostly ginger in colour, while in forested areas the fur can be a darker tan to black, like Sooty.  </p>

<p>The exact number of wild alpine dingoes is unknown but there are an estimated 10,000 to 50,000 dingoes, including desert and tropical ecotypes, in all of Australia.</p>

<p>Sooty will be now be part of a conservation breeding program to save alpine dingoes from extinction. </p>

<p>The Australian Dingo Foundation separately breeds alpine, desert and tropical dingoes to ensure that each ecotype is kept pure. </p>

<p>Sooty's discovery comes after another alpine dingo Wandi was discovered in a backyard after likely being dropped by an eagle in August last year.  </p>

<p>Sooty and Sassafras are both alpine dingoes, one of three dingo 'ecotypes' in Australia. They can be darker in colour and grow a second coat of fur to stay warm in high altitudes unlike their tropical and desert counterparts </p>
