<p>Three drowning fishermen were pulled to safety when their boat capsized as they were fishing for lobster near Roker Pier in Sunderland on Saturday</p>

<p>Several members of the public raised the alarm when they saw the men, who were trying to haul a lobster line back on board, hanging on to their upturned boat.</p>

<p>The Coastguard requested RNLI lifeboats be launched and crews from Tynemouth and Sunderland were called out.</p>

<p>Within 10 minutes, the RNLI volunteers had arrived at the scene where they grabbed the drowning fishermen and pulled them to safety. </p>

<p>The men were taken back to Sunderland Marina where paramedics checked them over and one man was taken to hospital.</p>

<p>A RNLI spokesperson said they have released the footage of the dramatic rescue to warn the public of the dangers of not wearing a life jacket.   </p>

<p>The dramatic lifeboat rescue was captured on video by RNLI volunteers who responded to the alert within minutes</p>

<p>RNLI volunteer helmsman Paul Nicholson said: 'We understand the boat capsized after becoming snagged on floating line from a lobster pot.</p>

<p>'Thankfully, our volunteers were able to respond extremely quickly to this incident and prevent a tragic accident which could have very easily ended up with three lives being lost.</p>

<p>'Hopefully, the dramatic photographs and video of this incident will act as a reminder to those who go out to sea about why it is important to wear your life jacket and not leave it in a locker on the boat.'</p>
