<p>Christine has made no secret of the fact that she has had cosmetic surgery, and is passionate that people should be honest about any procedures they've undergone.</p>

<p>The blonde bombshell told Vogue recently: 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia.  </p>

<p>'People think that [things are] real, and it's not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up.</p>

<p>'How I look on Selling Sunset is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>'The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two-and-a-half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either – $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap.'  </p>
