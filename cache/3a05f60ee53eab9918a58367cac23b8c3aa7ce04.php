<p>Violet Knox, two, was with another child outside the cottage in Beck Row, Suffolk on February 23 when her grandfather Andrew Peck lost sight of them both.</p>

<p>Mr Peck, who had been cutting wood outside the property, realised his granddaughter was missing when he noticed the other child was alone.      </p>

<p>The family searched the garden and Violet was found lying face down in the 20-inch-deep pond by her grandmother Angela Peck, Suffolk Coroner's Court was told.</p>

<p>Her mother Katie Knox, 30, who is trained in first aid, desperately tried to revive her daughter by doing chest compressions.</p>

<p>Violet Knox, two, was with another child outside the cottage in Beck Row, Suffolk on February 23 when her grandfather Andrew Peck lost sight of them both</p>

<p>Paramedics, an air ambulance crew and doctors continued resuscitation attempts for two hours before she was pronounced dead at the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds.   </p>

<p>A postmortem by consultant pathologist Xenia Tyler revealed that Violet had died 'rapidly' from a reflex cardiac arrest caused by sudden immersion in cold water, known as dry drowning. </p>

<p>In a statement, Mr Peck, 50, told how mother-of-four Mrs Knox and Violet had returned to his home with other family members after a pub lunch on February 23.</p>

<p>He said: 'Violet came outside with me and helped me put the wood away. I was cutting it and she was stacking it.'</p>

<p>Mr Peck added his granddaughter and the other child then began playing with a broken tent and jumping on a trampoline.</p>

<p>Her mother Katie Knox, 30, who is trained in first aid, desperately tried to revive her daughter by doing chest compressions</p>

<p>A short while later, he noticed the other child was alone, and went inside to check on Violet thinking she might be in the bath.</p>

<p>'The others said Violet wasn't in from the garden yet,' Mr Peck said.</p>

<p>'They worried, thinking she had gone out of the driveway gate but the pin was down in the hole [holding it shut].'</p>

<p>Mr Peck said he then heard his wife Angela Peck scream 'she's here' and saw Violet face down in the pond.</p>

<p>The inquest heard Violet was afraid of water and did not usually go near it, but the area may have been slippery due to recent rain. </p>

<p>Mrs Peck said in a statement: 'I saw Violet's dress floating in the pond and I thought, "What is her dress doing there?"</p>

<p>'As I got closer, I could see her head slightly underwater and screamed for help.' </p>

<p>Mrs Peck added that Violet and other children had always been told to stay away from the pond.</p>

<p>She said: 'She had never been interested in the ducks and geese around the garden although she loved our puppy.'</p>

<p>A postmortem revealed that Violet had died 'rapidly' from a reflex cardiac arrest caused by sudden immersion in cold water, known as dry drowning. Pictured: Suffolk Coroner's Court</p>

<p>Mrs Knox's sister Amy Peck, 26, said in her statement: 'Violet never normally went near the pond, but I remember it was very slippery due to recent rain.' </p>

<p>Consultant paediatrician Ian Evans said that Katie Knox and her husband Thomas were 'distraught' at the hospital as attempts continued to try and resuscitate Violet.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Claire Baldwin of Suffolk Police described Violet's death as 'a tragic and devastating accident'.</p>

<p>Mrs Knox said: 'Violet was a beautiful, loving little girl who loved to dance to any music, even stopping to dance outside shops if she heard tracks.</p>

<p>'She loved Peppa Pig and Shaun the Sheep, and loved running up and down with her dolls' pram. She had a smile and a wave for everybody.'</p>

<p>Suffolk coroner Nigel Parsley recorded a conclusion of accidental death. He added: 'This is a particularly tragic case.'</p>

<p>Mrs Peck said after the hearing: 'The NHS went above and beyond, and so did the air ambulance crew. I really want to praise them.' </p>
