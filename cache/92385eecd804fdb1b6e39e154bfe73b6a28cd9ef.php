<p>The former reality star praised the procedure and called her Double Bay-based surgeon, Dr Anoop Rastogi, 'amazing'. </p>

<p>Posing in a skimpy pink bikini, the 29-year-old boasted: 'As you guys can probably tell, I'm quite happy with my fat transfer!'</p>

<p>She explained to fans that the enhancement surgery achieved 'natural' looking breasts, taking her from a small C cup to a large D cup. </p>

<p>'This isn't an implant, these aren't silicone, this is all of my breast,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's just the extra bit of fat I have on the side of my thighs that I wasn't happy with, injected into my boobs,' she added.</p>

<p>Wet and wild! She then posted multiple videos of herself sunbathing in the skimpy bikini and seductively exiting a pool</p>

<p>Careful! In one clip, the blonde beauty almost suffered a wardrobe malfunction as she bounced around in the bikini </p>

<p>The blonde bombshell revealed that she spent two weeks in bed recovering and had no complications, but noted that different people will have different recovery times.</p>

<p>Jessika said: 'I would suggest this to anyone, I would suggest it over implants any day.'</p>

<p>She also revealed that she would only consider getting implants after having children.</p>

<p>Jessika's fat transfer 'boob job' isn't the only cosmetic procedure she's undergone.</p>

<p>She told New Idea last year that she's had over $50,000 worth of surgery since appearing on Married At First Sight in 2019.</p>

<p>In addition to the $16,000 fat transfer and breast augmentation, she has also had cheek and lip fillers and veneers.</p>

<p>'Throughout the show I was criticised for my fake lips and my fake this or that, so the last thing I needed to do was go and get fake boobs,' she said, explaining her decision to have a fat transfer instead of traditional silicone implants.</p>
