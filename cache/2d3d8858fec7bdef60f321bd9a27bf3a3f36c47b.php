<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When it comes to fashion, we are all inspired by what we see; whether it be a well-dressed celebrity, a blow-your-mind catwalk presentation or even a super stylish every-day passerby.</p>

<p>As fashion editors, we're moved by all of the above, and then some. We're exposed to under-the-radar labels; we get a first-hand look at collections months before they hit stores; we're tapped into brands with chic-yet-cheap offerings and we shop - a lot.</p>

<p>To share our knowledge, FEMAIL brings you Style Swoon, a weekly series of the latest, greatest and on the verge. We hope this Friday series will serve as a buying guide and point of inspiration for the clotheshorses and fashion fanatics alike.</p>

<p>'When I launched Baby Phat in 1999, I had to fight for a seat at the table in both the high-fashion and streetwear worlds,' said the supermodel.</p>

<p>'I did that by staying true to myself and bringing up an entire generation who embraced diversity, body-positivity and body-confidence all while being unapologetically glam and sexy. </p>

<p>'Buying back the brand has given me the opportunity to tell that story all over again to a new generation--a generation I raised. Launching into beauty, feels like the most relevant way to tell that story in today’s landscape.'</p>

<p>To bring Baby Phat Beauty to the masses, Kimora and her daughters  teamed up and the Beauty and Wellness Incubator, HatchBeauty Brands.</p>

<p>'We felt that casualwear deserved to be as exciting as anything else you wear. Because while we always aspire to capture bits of happiness within our collections, this year has meant figuring out the things that make you most happy in your own company. </p>

<p>'We were determined to make clothes that did just that.'</p>

<p>With inspiration from California skate culture, 80’s rainbow-like home workout videos, and the colors of the LA sky changing from day to night, the 12-piece Casual Collection was born. </p>

<p>Comprised of soft cottons, pastel french terry, rainbow embroidery, glittering nylons and neon stitching and dyed in their most beloved signature hues (like hot pink!), all you need is a pair of roller skates to complete the epic look!</p>

<p>One of a kind: 'In a year where we’ve all had to find comfort in our own solitude, we wanted to create a collection that would imbue some joie de vivre into the everyday,' said the brand</p>
