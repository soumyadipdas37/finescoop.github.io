<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain have moved ahead of Manchester City in the race to sign Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, according to reports.</p>

<p>The French champions are keen to make the 29-year-old centre-back their key defensive signing of the summer in a deal worth £75million, The Telegraph has said.</p>

<p>Senegal captain Koulibaly has impressed with his commanding performances for Napoli, whose coach, Gennaro Gattuso, has admitted he could leave.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain are believed to have made Kalidou Koulibaly their main defensive target</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky Sport, Gattuso said: 'I have no doubts he is one of the strongest champions in the world in his role.</p>

<p>'He has always given me great availability and always trains well. I would be sorry to lose him, both for the man and for the player.</p>

<p>"But you know that numbers are important for clubs and at this moment something needs to be done for numbers. But I'd be happy to keep him."</p>

<p>City boss Pep Guardiola has turned his attention to French Under 21 international Jules Kounde, who has a £68.25million buyout clause at the Liga side.</p>

<p>Man City have had a bid rejected for Sevilla star Jules Kounde and could miss out on Koulibaly</p>

<p>Sevilla sporting director Monchi revealed that the UEFA Super Cup hopefuls have rejected a recent bid for the 21-year-old from City.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of the clash with Bayern Munich in Budapest, Monchi said: 'I doubt that Kounde has an agreement with Man City because he has a contract with us.</p>

<p>'It's true, in the last days we received an offer from a club to sign Kounde. He heard about it and we rejected it.</p>

<p>'If they make another offer, we will listen to them again and we will answer. But only we can choose when we will answer them.</p>

<p>'I know Kounde pretty well and I'm sure he is focused on how he will defend against [Robert] Lewandowski, [Leroy] Sane, [Serge] Gnabry or [Thomas] Muller.'</p>

<p>City boss Pep Guardiola has brought in Nathan Ake for £41million and is planning more recruits</p>
