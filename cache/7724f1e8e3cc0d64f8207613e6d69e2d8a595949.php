<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Israel Adesanya dispatched of Paulo Costa in style at UFC 253 but he wasn't happy with everything that unfolded on Saturday night. </p>

<p>The middleweight champion defended his title with a second round TKO and went on to dedicate a portion his post-fight interview to addressing a problem he sees in the sport today.</p>

<p>That was the issue of fighters missing weight, Adesanya clearly unhappy that two fighters had done so on the card. </p>

<p>One of those was Ludovit Klein, who weighed five pounds over for his featherweight victory against Shane Young, who is a teammate of Adesanya at City Kickboxing in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Zubaira Tukhugov missed weight by the same margin for his fight and both men were docked 30 per cent of their pay but Adesanya believes that amount isn't enough. </p>

<p>'I told Dana, 30% is not enough. F*** that,' the 31-year-old said to Jon Anik in the octagon following his win. 'Some of these guys are gangsters they're making money outside the UFC. 30 per cent ain't shit to them. </p>

<p>'So don't give up that to not make the weight and have 90 minutes to keep on making the weight. And they're just 'Ah, f*** it'. They just drink their waters and whatnot.'</p>

<p>'30 per cent is not enough. Make it 90 per cent and that way I guarantee you they will spend every second in that 90 minutes trying to make the weight and not just bi**h out.</p>
