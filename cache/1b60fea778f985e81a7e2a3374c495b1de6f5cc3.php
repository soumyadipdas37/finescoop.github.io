<p>A skirmish with Novakovic prior to a DJ gig last year at the Tomorrowland festival in Belgium 'was definitely a moment' she wanted cut from the special, This Is Paris director Alexandra Dean told TooFab Monday. 'It was truly crazy and electrifying to see, let alone film.'</p>

<p>'You could see [Novakovic] really pushes her to the edge and Paris really puts down a boundary for the first time.</p>

<p>Clash: Paris Hilton, 39, wanted a vicious fight with her ex-boyfriend Aleks Novakovic removed from her YouTube Originals doc This Is Paris</p>

<p>In the exchange, which took place at EDM festival Tomorrowland, the socialite, 39, and Novakovic butted heads just prior to Hilton's set.</p>

<p>After Novakovic griped to the Stars Are Blind singer that she'd repeatedly left him by himself at the event, she lost her patience after he carelessly dropped a computer of her's that was essential to her performance.</p>

<p>'You can't just drop a computer before a set!' she said. 'The computer could break. Will someone who's not gonna drop it, take it?' </p>

<p>Hilton was especially upset with the timing of her beau's outburst, asking others to keep him at a distance as she mentally readied herself for the set in front of 80,000 festival attendees.</p>

<p>Angered: After Novakovic griped to the Stars Are Blind singer that she'd repeatedly left him by himself at the event, she lost her patience after he carelessly dropped a computer of her's that was essential to her performance</p>

<p>'Can you tell him to chill the f*** out?' she said. 'This is f<strong><em>ed up. I'm playing Tomorrowland. He needs to chill the f</em></strong> out. I'm sick of this s***. I'm playing in six minutes.'</p>

<p>Hilton said that Novakovic was 'so insecure,' eventually removing his access bracelet from his wrist and having venue security throw him out of the area.</p>

<p>The director Dean said of the fight, 'I think everyone feels what I feel watching it, which is, yeah, finally, put down a boundary, be yourself. Respect your own boundaries, you know?</p>

<p>Bad timing: The fight came before Paris played the Tomorrowland festival last summer in Belgium </p>

<p>'She clearly isn't doing that for any cameras, she's really struggling and she's letting that struggle unfold on camera. That was when we had been filming for a really long time and the cameras had become invisible.' </p>

<p>Dean credited Hilton for not pushing the issue on including the footage.</p>

<p>‘She could have cried, she could have kicked her feet, she could have said no Tomorrowland. There was definitely a moment where she wanted to do that and she didn't. I have huge respect for her after that.'</p>
