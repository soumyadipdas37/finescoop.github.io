<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds are plotting a second bid to lure lightning-heeled Wales winger Daniel James from Manchester United, according to reports.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old was set to sign for Marcelo Bielsa's side in January 2019 before his switch from Championship Swansea collapsed on transfer deadline day.  </p>

<p>He joined United for £18million in June last year but barely featured at the end of last season, starting just one of the club's final 10 fixtures.</p>

<p>Manchester United wideman Daniel James is being courted by Leeds after falling out of favour </p>

<p>James was replaced by Mason Greenwood at the interval as United slumped to a 3-1 defeat against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday.</p>

<p>Long-term admirer Bielsa believes he could capture James for around £12million plus add-ons, The Sun has reported. </p>

<p>Leeds could also consider a loan move for the out-of-favour youngster, who would add scintillating pace to an attack that has provided seven goals in their opening two Premier League games.</p>

<p>James made a dazzling start to his career at the club but has barely featured in recent months </p>

<p>James scored three times in the opening four games of last season, netting within minutes of coming on for his debut in the 4-0 opening day win over Chelsea.</p>

<p>He also provided seven assists but has not scored a Premier League goal for more than a year.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old helped Wales to qualify for Euro 2020 and has been supported by Ryan Giggs </p>
