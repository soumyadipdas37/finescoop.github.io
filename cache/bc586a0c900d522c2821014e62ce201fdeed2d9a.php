<p>Yes girl! Kate gave herself an all-over body workout with ball slams before further toning her arms by pulling on weighted equipment</p>

<p>In the clip, the couple Zoomed their nearest and dearest as they asked them to guess whether it was a girl or a boy.</p>

<p>Harry then went to a goal post, which had a huge inflatable ball hanging off it, and kicked a football at it which exploded and released blue air. The footballer met Kate while they were at school.</p>

<p>He proposed in July 2017 when the childhood sweethearts were away on holiday in Barbados. </p>

<p>Hot and sweaty: Kate was put through her paces in the gym</p>

<p>At the time, the England captain joked to his partner he would not cry on his wedding day and that he would only shed tears if England won a trophy. </p>

<p>He said: 'I always wind my missus up that I'd cry if we won a trophy with England. And she said if you don't cry when I walk down the aisle then she won't go through with it!</p>

<p>'I'm not a crier, I'm not someone who cries a lot. My missus has probably never seen me cry. So we'll have to see what comes first.'   </p>

<p>They're expecting! In July, footballer Harry, 26, shared an intimate look at their virtual gender reveal where he kicked an inflatable football filled with blue smoke</p>
