<p>Restaurant and Catering Australia is pushing Dan Andrews' government to bail out the struggling industry with the $650million plan. </p>

<p>Similar schemes have been rolled out in the UK, where 40 million meals were offered at half price, and Tasmania, on Monday. </p>

<p>Melbourne has been under Stage Four lockdown since August 2, the state's second round of restrictions since March. </p>

<p>Wes Lambert, CEO, of Restaurant and Catering Australia told radio station 3AW it is the fastest way to get businesses back on their feet.  </p>

<p>'It's time for Dan to pay for his plan,' he told listeners.</p>

<p>'Until we get bums back on seats in Victoria, into restaurants, there will be no recovery.' </p>

<p>Mr Lambert has suggested a meal voucher of up to $100 be distributed to every Victorian household after the curfew is lifted. </p>

<p>The Tasmanian government launched 'Make Yourself At Home' on Monday which saw $7.5million dollars worth of vouchers snapped up in 40 minutes. </p>

<p>The $100 accommodation and $50 experience vouchers are designed to encourage people to travel and eat out again.  </p>

<p>Diners in the UK were offered half-price meals from Monday to Wednesday in August as part of 'Eat out to help out'. </p>

<p>'Nearly 40 million meals were subsided by the UK government to bring the restaurant industry in the UK out of the brink,' he told listeners.   </p>

<p>He said it can be hard for state and federal governments to implement a new scheme quickly - so the industry would follow either Tasmania or the UK if necessary.  </p>

<p>'This is the fastest and best way to help the hospitality industry get back on its feet and to get consumers back and dining,' Mr Lambert said.</p>
