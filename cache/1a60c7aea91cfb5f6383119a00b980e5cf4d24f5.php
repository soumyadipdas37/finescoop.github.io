<p>Revealing the title of the new song, 'Better' in a tweet to his 29.4million followers, Zayn gave a sneak-peek at the racy video which offered a glimpse of the star shirtless. </p>

<p>Zayn has been teasing his return to music for a number of weeks, posting an Instagram snap at the beginning of September with the caption 'Got some stuff to show ya soon!'</p>

<p>Thrilling: Excitement has been building for Zayn's new release after the ex One Direction star posted a 14 second clip of the music video earlier this week</p>

<p>Zayn's 2018 album Icarus Falls received good reviews but peaked at just 61 on the US Billboard 200 and 77 on the UK Albums Chart. </p>

<p>The singer has been open about his struggles with anxiety which has led to him rarely performing live during his solo career.</p>

<p>During a 2017 interview with Vogue, the star admitted: 'I always feel like I'm trying to work through whatever certain issues are around certain subjects.' </p>

<p>The news Gigi and Zayn were expecting first emerged in April after a 'family source' spilled the beans about the IMG beauty and her on/off boyfriend of five years. </p>

<p>Baby girl: Shortly after Zayn's post Gigi uploaded her own touching message, sharing: 'Our girl joined us earth-side this weekend and she’s already changed our world. So in love'</p>

<p>Parental pride! 'Our baby girl is here, healthy &amp; beautiful' the Pillowtalk singer wrote along with a black and white photo of his heavily tattooed hand holding on to his pride and joy </p>

<p>Shortly after she confirmed the news herself. </p>

<p>Gigi said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. </p>

<p>'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.' </p>

<p>Gigi hinted that her child was on the way at the end of August when she shared a stunning photo of herself at 33-weeks.</p>
