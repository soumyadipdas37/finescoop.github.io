<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>He recently signed on to executive produce a gritty drama reboot of his series The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air.</p>

<p>But Will Smith only had eyes for the original series on Sunday when he shared a photo of himself and his old pal DJ Jazzy Jeff in front of the Bel Air mansion that was featured weekly on the TV show that made him a household name.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old actor was celebrating a partnership with the luxurious mansion's owners to rent off a wing of the home on Airbnb for an astoundingly cheap $30 per night to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>Nostalgia: Will Smith, 51, shared a selfie of himself and DJ Jazzy Jeff on Sunday as they stood in front of the Fresh Prince Of Bel Air mansion. The actor has partnered with Airbnb to put it on the market for five nights</p>

<p>Will's Instagram selfie showed himself beaming in a green white and black tie-dye jacket over a white shirt, while Jeff wore gray–blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up and gestured toward the mansion.</p>

<p>'YOOOO!! Y’all think we should rent out the <?php echo e('@'); ?>freshprince house?? We’re making it happen with the squad at <?php echo e('@'); ?>airbnb!!' he wrote, adding, '#FreshPrince30th.'</p>

<p>Although the mansion was advertised as being in the tony neighborhood of Bel Air, the real-life location is located in the similarly upscale LA neighborhood Brentwood.</p>

<p>The mansion was used on the series for exterior shooting, but the interiors were all filmed on a stage. </p>

<p>New digs: 'YOOOO!! Y’all think we should rent out the <?php echo e('@'); ?>freshprince house?? We’re making it happen with the squad at <?php echo e('@'); ?>airbnb!!' he wrote, adding, '#FreshPrince30th'</p>

<p>Helping out: Will doesn't own the mansion, but he's partnering with the owners to put a wing of the home on Airbnb for five nights in October at only $30 per night to mark the show's 30th anniversary</p>

<p>Decked out: Although Will and his costar didn't film inside the actual mansion, it has since been decorated as if his character live there</p>

<p>Big break: Will starred on the NBC comedy series for six seasons from 1990 to 1996; pictured with the cast of The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air</p>

<p>Will is partnering with the Airbnb and the mansion's owners to open up a portion of the home for a limited number of nights.</p>

<p>Though he doesn't own the home, he's listed as the host on Airbnb.</p>

<p>'Ready for the freshest staycation ever?' he wrote. 'If this place looks familiar that’s because it’s just as fly as it was when I first rolled up the driveway. I’m back. And this time, I’m handing you the keys so you’ll have my wing of the mansion all to yourself — but my sneaker collection is off limits, aight?'  </p>

<p>Although Will and his costar didn't film inside the actual mansion, it has since been decorated as if his character live there, with an opulent bedroom film with graffiti art, memorabilia and a hat and sneaker collection display.</p>

<p>Despite all the expensive decorations, Will's Airbnb ad says guests can lace up 'a fresh pair of Jordans before shooting some b-ball in the bedroom.'</p>

<p>Classic taste: Will's room is decorated with graffiti art and features memorabilia from the show</p>

<p>Special treat: One corner of the bedroom includes part of Will's hat and sneaker collection</p>

<p>Risky business: Despite all the expensive decorations, Will's Airbnb ad says guests can lace up 'a fresh pair of Jordans before shooting some b-ball in the bedroom'</p>

<p>They can also imitate DJ Jazzy Jeff by spinning on turntables, or simply try out a 'fly look' from a closet stocked with clothing inspired by Will's TV character.</p>

<p>Guests will be able to enjoy some highbrow culture with the elegant grand piano or try something more lowbrow with with a foosball table, as Will's character watches from the sidelines via a portrait on the wall.</p>

<p>Though guests have free range of the kitchen, they'll also be served regular meals in the elegant wood-paneled dining room and served on silver trays.</p>

<p>Although the air quality is currently poor due to wildfires raging near Los Angeles, guests will have the opportunity to lounge under the sun by the pool. </p>

<p>According to TMZ, Jeff will welcome guests virtually to the pool area if they want to relax outdoors. </p>

<p>Treat yourself: Guests will be able to enjoy some highbrow culture with the grand piano or try something more lowbrow with with a foosball table</p>

<p>Life of luxury: Though guests have free range of the kitchen, they'll also be served regular meals in the elegant wood-paneled dining room and served on silver trays</p>

<p>Lounging: Although the air quality is currently poor due to wildfires raging near Los Angeles, guests will have the opportunity to lounge under the sun by the pool</p>

<p>Ideal space: The long pool is equipped with plenty of comfortable lounge chairs for a whole family or a group of friends</p>

<p>Bookings for the mansion won't begin until September 29, and the home is only available on October 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14, so it will likely sell out almost immediately.</p>

<p>The home's owners are limiting stays to only a single night, and only LA County residents will be allowed to rent out the mansion.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, any group with multiple people will also have to prove that they're currently living together so as not to increase the possibility of infection. </p>

<p>The listing also tries to ease potential renters' worries by clarifying that the wing of the mansion will be cleaned according to CDC recommendations between stays.</p>

<p>Potential renters can know that they're also doing a good deed by renting out the home, as Airbnb will make a one-time donation to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Philadelphia, where Will famously hails from.</p>

<p>Extremely limited: Only five dates are being offered, so it will likely sell out immediately. Guests must live in LA County and need to prove they've been living together for coronavirus safety purposes; still from Fresh Prince</p>

<p>Reunited: Smith shared a shot of himself and Janet Hubert, who played Aunt Viv until she was replaced by Reed amid bad blood with Smith, suggesting they had buried the hatchet</p>

<p>Will recently sparked interest in a Fresh Prince reunion when he shared a screenshot of a chat with Janet Hubert, who played the original Aunt Vivian in the first three seasons.</p>

<p>She was later replaced for the last three seasons, and subsequently blamed her firing on Smith while vowing to never do a reunion for the show, but the two seem to have buried the hatchet since then.</p>

<p>The Gemini Man star also posted a photo of the entire cast on Thursday, minus Uncle Phil's James Avery, who died in 2013.</p>

<p>Time flies: Will posed with the cast of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in a group shot from the show's reunion to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the show originally airing</p>
