<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Chicago radio host has been fired after he remarked that an ESPN sideline reporter's outfit belonged at a porn awards show. </p>

<p>Dan McNeil of Chicago's 670 The Score ridiculed the ensemble Maria Taylor donned for Monday Night Football in a tweet during last night's face-off between the Giants and the Steelers.  </p>

<p>'NFL sideline reporter or a host for the AVN [Adult Video News] annual awards presentation?' McNeil wrote alongside a screengrab of Taylor. </p>

<p>He deleted the post after about 30 minutes, but not before it sparked outrage from several critics, including Taylor herself. </p>

<p>'Well Danny Dearest if you would like to continue making sexist comments about me…please bring your misogyny with you to the NBA Countdown doubleheader I’ll be hosting tomorrow night,' the reporter, who had just finished covering the first NFL game of her career, snapped back.</p>

<p>'Hey ladies remember you can wear whatever you feel confident in!' she added. </p>

<p>Entercom Chicago, which runs McNeil's show, issued a statement on Tuesday afternoon confirming that the host had been fired. </p>

<p>'NFL sideline reporter or a host for the AVN (Adult Video News) annual awards presentation?' McNeil wrote alongside a screengrab of Taylor. He deleted the post (pictured) after about 30 minutes, but not before it sparked outrage</p>

<p>Taylor called out McNeil's 'sexist comments' in her own tweet (pictured) late Monday night</p>

<p>'Dan McNeil is no longer an employee at The Score,' Entercom's Regional President Rachel Williamson said. </p>

<p>'For each one of us our words have power. For our brands and on-air personalities that is amplified and brings increased responsibility in how we chose [sic] to use our voices. </p>

<p>'Last night's tweet, and its degrading and humiliating tone to a fellow female broadcaster, was unacceptable. </p>

<p>'We have the best teams in Chicago, and we must hold ourselves to high expectations to continue to be leaders in our organization, our industry and our community. </p>

<p>'We apologize to all who were offended by Dan's words, especially Maria.' </p>

<p>Monday night marked Taylor's first time covering a primetime NFL game. She is seen interviewing Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin at Met Life stadium in New Jersey</p>

<p>Before tonight's #MNF matchup between the <?php echo e('@'); ?>Steelers and the <?php echo e('@'); ?>Giants, I caught up with <?php echo e('@'); ?>CoachTomlin to talk about how it feels to kick off the 2020 season and what he expects to see out of Ben Roethlisberger. pic.twitter.com/LfviAG33LF</p>

<p>McNeil (left and right) had been in Chicago sports radio for more than 30 years and co-hosted the McNeil &amp; Parkins Show every weekday from 2-6pm prior to his firing on Tuesday</p>

<p>Several of Taylor's ESPN colleagues chimed in to defend her on Twitter, including veteran sports journalist Jemelle Hill.  </p>

<p>'Just another example of what women have to go through in this business,' Hill wrote.</p>

<p>'Huge accomplishment for Maria to be part of the MNF team tonight and here comes an asshole trying to undermine a big moment in her career.' </p>

<p>Reporter Elle Duncan added: 'Imagine just crushing your first MNF gig and having a senior age man comment on your outfit as his biggest takeaway.'  </p>

<p>McNeil has not yet apologized or spoken publicly about his firing but did reply to one fan who slammed him on Twitter on Monday night.  </p>

<p>'Just wondering why you deleted your tweet you misogynistic f**k face,' the fan wrote. </p>

<p>McNeil replied: 'That's a big word for you.'</p>

<p>Several of Taylor's ESPN colleagues chimed in to defend her on Twitter, including veteran sports journalist Jemelle Hill</p>

<p>ESPN's Elle Duncan also mocked McNeil's comment</p>

<p>McNeil had been in Chicago sports radio for more than 30 years and co-hosted the  McNeil &amp; Parkins Show every weekday from 2-6pm.  </p>

<p>Last month another 670 The Score host, Bruce Levine, came under fire for posting a vulgar meme about Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton on Twitter.  </p>

<p>He deleted the tweet soon after and issued an apology, and was back on the air the next week.  </p>
