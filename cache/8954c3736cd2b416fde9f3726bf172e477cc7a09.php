<p>Gorgeous: Joan Smalls, 32, showed off her enviable physique and glamorous curls as she posed in a tiny white bikini during a yacht day in Croatia, on Wednesday</p>

<p>The model captioned the photographs with two lion emojis, as she showed off her wild side. </p>

<p>One shot which she uploaded to her Stories, allowed Joan to fully display her endless pins in all their glory. </p>

<p>Her glamorous getaway comes just weeks after she appeared to have confirmed she is dating Henry Junior Chalhoub - a year after the pair were presumed to be 'just friends'.  </p>

<p>Last August, they were snapped on a luxury yacht looking incredibly cosy, but it was said their relationship was platonic.</p>

<p>But at the end of July, they stepped out in Portofino, Italy holding hands and enjoying a romantic stroll, seemingly clarifying their romantic status. </p>

<p>Joan had been dating Modellounge founder Bernard Smith since 2011 - however they have not been pictured together since earlier in 2019. </p>

<p>Sensational: Joan struck a range of sultry poses, with her long brunette tresses falling down past her shoulders as she fully display her endless pins in all their glory</p>

<p>They briefly split at the start of their relationship, but Bernard was able to win back her heart and the pair had been together since. </p>

<p>Seen in Miami together in January 2019, things looked to be going strong between Joan and Bernard - with her posing for beach snaps while he played photographer.</p>

<p>They were seen cuddling up on a sun-lounger people-watching together, looking very at ease, but it appears that somewhere in early 2019, the couple called it quits. </p>

<p>MailOnline approached Joan Smalls' representatives for comment at the time.    </p>
