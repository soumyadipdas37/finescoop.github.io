<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chris Hemsworth and his wife of ten years Elsa Pataky have listed their Malibu home for $4.9million.</p>

<p>The Avengers: Endgame actor, 37, and his Fast Five star spouse, 44, purchased the secluded Point Dume house for $3.45million in early 2016.</p>

<p>The move comes as Hemsworth continues to develop his second sprawling Byron Bay property in the Hollywood A-lister's native Australia. </p>

<p>Packing up: Chris Hemsworth and his wife of ten years Elsa Pataky have listed their Malibu home for $4.9million</p>

<p>The four bedroom, four bathroom Malibu house spans over 4600 square feet and sits on approximately 1.25 hillside acres.</p>

<p>It features a fireplace, dining terrace with built-in grill, a library, sunken courtyard garden and expansive views of the surrounding mountain ranges. </p>

<p>The Australian actor and his Spanish bride previously owned an even larger home in the same area - a 6000 square foot house purchased from Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan in 2013 for $4.8million.</p>

<p>The couple subsequently sold the property in 2016 for $7million, well above the $6.5million asking price. </p>

<p>The sellers: The Avengers: Endgame actor, 37, and his Fast Five star spouse, 44, purchased the secluded Point Dume house for $3.45million in early 2016. The couple seen here in 2019</p>

<p>Vistas: The four bedroom, four bathroom Malibu house spans over 4600 square feet and sits on approximately 1.25 hillside acres</p>

<p>Room with a view: It features a fireplace, dining terrace with built-in grill, a library, sunken courtyard garden and expansive views of the surrounding mountain ranges</p>

<p>Downsizing: The Australian actor and his Spanish bride previously owned an even larger home in the same area - a 6000 square foot house purchased from Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan in 2013 for $4.8million</p>

<p>Hemsworth finished building his $20million mansion in Broken Head, near Byron Bay, Australia, last year.</p>

<p>And as of last month, the father-of-three had moved on to his new project: a sprawling family ranch located in the same picturesque suburb.</p>

<p>Aerial photos taken on Sunday show that construction is well under way on the 35-hectare estate, which Chris purchased for AU$4.25million ($3.1million) in 2019. </p>

<p>Large stables surrounded by fenced-off riding tracks have been built on the land, most likely for Chris' wife, Elsa, who is an avid horse rider.</p>

<p>Profit: The couple subsequently sold the property in 2016 for $7million, well above the $6.5million asking price</p>

<p>Kitchen: The home's large kitchen also boasts impressive views of the exclusive Point Dume neighborhood</p>

<p>Smallest room in the house: Pictured here is one of the house's four bathrooms</p>

<p>Ritzy: Many Hollywood celebrities flock to the Point Dume neighborhood, as seen here in an aerial view</p>

<p>A horse riding arena complete with jumping fences has also been erected nearby.</p>

<p>The Hemsworths appear to be in the process of creating a garden oasis, complete with a fountain water feature, outside the stables.</p>

<p>On the edge of the land is a man-made lake, in which there appears to be a large floatie or trampoline.</p>

<p>The estate was purchased in an off-market deal last September by CHLH Management, of which Chris is listed as director.</p>

<p>Given that the company name also bears his brother Liam's initials, it is believed the youngest Hemsworth also has an interest in the property.</p>

<p>Reading nook: Seen here is the home's library, which also offers panoramic vistas for the occupant</p>

<p>Fireplace: The home also includes a fireplace for chilly nights, as well as space for a massive flat screen television</p>

<p>Last July, Chris finally unveiled his AU$20million ($14.6million) Byron Bay mega-mansion after a staggering three years of construction.  </p>

<p>According to the Gold Coast Bulletin, who report that they've seen the floor plans, the Thor star and his wife and their three children have access to a whopping ten bathrooms.</p>

<p>And the family have a total of 26 surfboard racks to use, no doubt handy for keen surfer Chris.</p>

<p>For a touch of old-fashioned glamour comes in the form of a butler's pantry, a space traditionally used for preparing food for a large number of guests.</p>

<p>Heading home: The move comes as Hemsworth continues to develop his second sprawling Byron Bay property in the Hollywood A-lister's native Australia</p>

<p>Decked out: Per the Zillow listing, the Malibu home's kitchen includes a dishwasher, garbage disposal and a freezer</p>

<p>Two bars are also well suited to entertaining the couple's large circle of friends.</p>

<p>The property functions as it's own retreat too, with a steam room, sauna room and massage room, as well as a gym.</p>

<p>There's also a 50 metre infinity pool fit for a luxury resort and a lovely outdoor pond.</p>

<p>A games room, TV room, living room, dining room, lounge and fire pit make for a both cosy and spacious home.</p>

<p>Rounding up the features are seven car spaces, five bedrooms, and a study.</p>

<p>Chris and Elsa tied the knot in 2010 and share daughter India Rose, eight, and sons Tristan and Sasha, six. </p>
