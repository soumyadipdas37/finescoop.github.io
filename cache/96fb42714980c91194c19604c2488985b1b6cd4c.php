<p>QPR winger Bright Osayi-Samuel is hoping Crystal Palace make a bid for him this summer</p>

<p>The 22-year-old (R) has been linked with Palace after stalling on signing a new deal with QPR</p>

<p>The report adds Palace have been monitoring him for more than 12 months now and have already raided QPR this summer after signing Eberechi Eze for £19.5m.</p>

<p>The Championship side want Osayi-Samuel to sign an improved deal to stop him leaving for the Premier League on the cheap, while also believing the right-sided player needs another year with them.</p>

<p>Osayi-Samuel was the subject of two bids from Belgian side Club Brugge this summer, the second of which was accepted by QPR, but the player himself turned down the move.</p>

<p>QPR took up the option to extend his contract by 12 months earlier this year, but that means he will become a free agent next summer if he continues to stall on a new deal.</p>

<p>The report adds they would be open to selling now if he could be loaned back for this season.</p>

<p>Palace meanwhile are also reportedly interested in signing Jeremie Boga as a replacement for Wilfried Zaha, who is determined to leave Palace this summer and has attracted interest from Paris Saint-Germain, Borussia Dortmund and Monaco.</p>
