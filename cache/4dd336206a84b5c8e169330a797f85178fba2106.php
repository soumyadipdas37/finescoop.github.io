<p>A poll has shown that 70 per cent of Real Madrid fans are angry at the sale of Sergio Reguilon</p>

<p>The study by Marca showed 65 per cent of fans were in favour of Marcelo leaving instead</p>

<p>Reguilon spent last season on loan at Sevilla with Marcelo and Ferland Mendy keeping him out of Zinedine Zidane's squad. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old impressed and has been the subject of interest from several clubs this summer but looks set to seal a £27million move to Spurs.  </p>

<p>Fans are disappointed that the defender, who was tipped for big things after working his way up through the academy, is set to depart after a good spell with Sevilla. </p>

<p>Reguilon made 38 appearances for Sevilla last season, helping the club win the Europa League and finish fourth in LaLiga.</p>

<p>The left back is on the verge of joining Tottenham after spending last season on loan at Sevilla</p>

<p>He enjoyed more playing time under previous Real managers Julen Lopetegui and Santiago Solari but Zidane's arrival saw him fall down the pecking order after the arrival of Mendy last summer.  </p>

<p>The left back is set to finalise his move to the Premier League with team-mate Bale, who is returning to Spurs after leaving the club seven years ago.</p>

<p>Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Wednesday that Bale has agreed a season-long loan deal to return to north London and the Welshman has been spotted arriving at Tottenham's training ground, with Reguilon also pictured.</p>
