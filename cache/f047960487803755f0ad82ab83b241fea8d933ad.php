<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Shares in Ocado hit a record high after the online grocer revealed Marks &amp; Spencer's products have been more popular with customers than Waitrose's were.</p>

<p>Ocado has been selling M&amp;S goods on its website alongside its own since September 1, when a 20-year partnership with Waitrose came to an end.</p>

<p>Allaying fears shoppers would desert Ocado once it made the switch, finance boss Duncan Tatton-Brown said there was 'practically no sign' that it had lost any customers.</p>

<p>Taste test: Ocado has been selling M&amp;S goods on its website alongside its own since September 1 when a 20-year partnership with Waitrose came to an end</p>

<p>There has been particularly strong demand for M&amp;S's famed ready meals and Percy Pig treats, as well as staples such as milk, cucumbers and carrots.</p>

<p>And shoppers have put an extra five items or so in their baskets because of the 'excitement around the launch of M&amp;S products', Ocado said.</p>

<p>Ocado shares surged on the update, rising 10.7 per cent, or 253p, to 2608p, while M&amp;S shares climbed by 4.4 per cent, or 4.55p, to 109.25p.</p>

<p>Ocado shares have risen 103 per cent this year and the company is now valued at £19.5billion, just £2billion less than Tesco.</p>

<p>Ocado had a tiny 1.7 per cent share of the UK's overall grocery market in the most recent 12-week period, compared with a near 27 per cent share held by Tesco.</p>

<p>Ocado hailed the 'successful switchover' from Waitrose to M&amp;S as it posted a huge rise in sales during the 13 weeks to September 1.</p>

<p>Quarterly revenue at its retail business surged by 52 per cent to £587million compared with the same period of last year.</p>

<p>And the average number of orders it received per week rose by 10 per cent to 345,000, as it managed to keep hold of customers who signed up during lockdown.</p>

<p>Ocado shares have risen 103 per cent this year and the company is now valued at £19.5bn, just £2bn less than Tesco</p>

<p>Ocado expects profits to reach around £40million in 2020. It booked a £43.3million profit in 2019.</p>

<p>The online grocer notched up its busiest-ever day for orders when the M&amp;S partnership launched on September 1. </p>

<p>But it also got off to a rocky start, with some customers complaining that orders had been cancelled at short notice.</p>

<p>Ocado blamed this on a 'surge in demand'. It plans to increase its capacity by a further 40 per cent next year by building three more of its robotic warehouses in Andover, Bristol and Purfleet.</p>

<p>M&amp;S is pinning its hopes on the tie-up after the pandemic hammered its performance on the High Street and it announced plans to cut 7,000 jobs from its 66,000-strong shop-floor workforce. </p>

<p>Analysts had been sceptical last year when it paid £750million to buy a 50 per cent stake in Ocado's retail business, which marks the first time its groceries have been put on sale online.</p>

<p>So far the 4,000 Waitrose products that were available on Ocado's site have been replaced by 4,400 M&amp;S items.</p>

<p>Another 800 food options will be added to its range in the run-up to Christmas, capitalising on M&amp;S's reputation for doing high-quality party treats.</p>

<p>Analysts said the results had not just been promising for Ocado, but also for M&amp;S.</p>

<p>Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at investment manager Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'This could bode well for Marks &amp; Spencer, whose sales could do with a boost, and who staked a lot on this deal paying off.</p>

<p>'98pc of customers are already shopping at M&amp;S, though, so it will be interesting to see how many of these sales will have simply transferred from stores.'</p>

<p>Peel Hunt analysts said Ocado had had a 'storming' third quarter. They said: 'The M&amp;S transition is performing excellently: nearly every customer is already shopping for M&amp;S products and the weighing in-basket of those products is greater than it was with Waitrose's products.'</p>
