<p>Spookfest: Vanessa Hudgens was at it again on Instagram on Thursday, heralding the impending arrival of Halloween at the end of next month with a 'spooky' and rather early post</p>

<p>The High School Musical star added a violet-colored filter to one of the still images, as well as an eye sparkle.</p>

<p>Her eyes were particularly emphasized with the help of generous helpings of cosmetics. </p>

<p>Hudgens wore a pair of shiny nameplate necklaces as well, which said 'Witch' and 'Craft'. </p>

<p>We would like to know: The singer-actress, 31, sparkled in the heavily made-up lewk, with pouty lips, a heart-shaped mole, glittery bat-shaped hair berets and large hoop earrings</p>

<p>In the video component to Vanessa's post, some creepy ambient music played in the background as she preened and posed for the camera.</p>

<p>The starlet captioned the post, 'Just because it’s Thursday... spooky bratz doll? Loool #spookyseason'.</p>

<p>And curiously enough, the comparison was rather spot on. </p>

<p>The resemblance is actually uncanny: The starlet captioned the post, 'Just because it’s Thursday... spooky bratz doll? Loool #spookyseason'</p>

<p>Vanessa continued to have fun on Instagram using the Stories feature, uploading further images and clips of herself in the Bratz-inspired ensemble.</p>

<p>One funny shot showed her looking especially loopy, with the caption 'Literally sitting by myself watching the Lakers game like dissss'.</p>

<p>She kept the witchy vibe going in other passages on her Stories, showing some motivational workout snippets in which she used a devil horn filter as well as one which gave her pentagram stars on her cheeks. </p>
