<p>Speaking on the Official James Bond Podcast, Lea explained why it was so important to see Bond fall in love again after having his heart broken by Vespa (played by Eva Green) in 2005's Casino Royale.</p>

<p>She said: 'I think that it's also because of Bond and we needed Madeline to tell Bond's story I mean it was important to see Bond in love again because he had this relationship with Vespa but she betrayed him.</p>

<p>'But this time I think she's the real love in a way, I think it's really the film is a love story it's a story between the two of them so it's very unusual for a Bond film to see James Bond in love right? And I think it's quite modern in a way.</p>

<p>'In this film it's even more psychological and more emotional and I think that it's something that Daniel as James Bond created with this character.</p>

<p>She said: 'It turns into a mutual respect from each other because they come from the same programme, but she's definitely technologically more advanced.</p>

<p>'She's like she's had a James Bond file at home she's studying for two years and now she's had that opportunity to sit down with him and tell him exactly what she thinks...</p>
