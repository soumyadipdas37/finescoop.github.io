<p>The study compared 100 obese children aged between six and 18 who were either put on a standard calorie-restricted diet or one that included probiotics.</p>

<p>After monitoring the children for eight weeks, scientists found that those on the diet including probiotics lost more weight and had improved insulin sensitivity, reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes. </p>

<p>The supplements contained Bifidobacteriums, which break down carbohydrates and fibres in the human gut. They also release chemicals called short-chain fatty acids, which play an important role in gut health and controlling hunger. </p>

<p>Probiotics found in yoghurt drinks could reduce childhood obesity and improve insulin sensitivity, cutting the risk of type 2 diabetes, a study has found</p>

<p>Dr Flavia Prodam and her team at the University of Piemonte Orientale, Italy, conducted the study to assess the impact of Bifidobacteria on children with obesity. </p>

<p>They analysed clinical, biochemical and stool samples to determine the effects of the probiotic and took measurements of waist circumference, BMI, insulin resistance and E.coli in the gut.  </p>

<p>'Probiotic supplements are frequently given to people without proper evidence data,' said Dr Prodam.</p>

<p>'These findings start to give evidence of the efficacy and safety of two probiotic strains in treating obesity in a younger population.</p>

<p>'The next step for our research is to identify patients that could benefit from this probiotic treatment, with a view to creating a more personalised weight-loss strategy.</p>

<p>'We also want to decipher more clearly the role of diet and probiotics on microbiome composition. This could help us to understand how the microbiota is different in young people with obesity.'</p>

<p>The yoghurt drinks contained Bifidobacteriums which are naturally found in the human gut and help to break down calories and fibre</p>

<p>Dr Flavia Prodam, who led the study, said it gave proper evidence of the influence of probiotics</p>

<p>The study suggests that supplementation with probiotics could modify the gut microbiome environment and beneficially affect metabolism, helping obese children or adolescents who are also undergoing a restricted diet to lose weight, the authors said.</p>

<p>But larger studies over a longer period of time are needed to investigate this, the scientists warned. </p>
