<p>Gasp: Christina recently shocked fans when she revealed her second marriage was coming to an end after being wed for less than two years</p>

<p>Food lover's dream: Anstead shared numerous snaps of the mouth-watering treats on display</p>

<p>Earlier in lockdown, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.</p>

<p>The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between himself and his kids.</p>

<p>However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family all together. 'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.</p>

<p>Clearly, the stresses of this year also took their toll on his relationship with his second wife, in spite of a cheery post in August celebrating their dating anniversary.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Ant will stay across the pond, or return to co-parent his young son in Orange County, California with Christina.</p>
