<p>The move could could dash Luis Suarez's proposed move from Barcelona despite passing Italian exam in bid to secure dual nationality  </p>

<p>Suarez has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Nou Camp by new boss Ronald Koeman and that has accelerated interest in him from Italian champions Juventus. </p>

<p>But with Andrea Pirlo limited as to the number of non-EU (European Union) players he can acquire in one window, the club needed Suarez to pass his exam in Perugia and acquire dual nationality to make a transfer possible this month. </p>
