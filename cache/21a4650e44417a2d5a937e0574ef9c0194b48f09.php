<p>The antiviral drug was approved for emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after it was shown to help reduce patients' hospital stays over a placebo, in a trial from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

<p>But a report published on Friday from the drug's California-based maker, Gilead Sciences Inc, says the effects of the medication may only be seen in those with severe infections.</p>

<p>Researchers found a group of patients given the drug for five days saw their conditions improved but a similar group who received the drug for an average of six days had no significant benefit. </p>

<p>Remdesvir is the only drug in the US approved for emergency use in patients with severe cases of coronavirus. Pictured: A vial of remdesivir at the University Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, April 8</p>

<p>In a new study of moderate cases, researchers gave one-third of patients a five-day dose, another one-third a 10-day dose and the last group got standard case.

<p>Patients in the five-day group saw their conditions improve compared to the standard care group but the 10-day group, who received the drug for an average of six days, saw no significant benefit (above)</p>

<p>Remdesivir was developed to treat Ebola, the deadly fever that emerged in West Africa in 2014.</p>

<p>While it was unsuccessful in treating Ebola, the drug appears to interfere with the ability of the coronavirus to copy its genetic material.</p>

<p>In April, the NIH released results from a study that found remdesivir helped patients recover 31 percent faster.</p>

<p>Patients being given the drug improved after 11 days, four days faster than those who didn't receive the medication.</p>

<p>While the NIH study and others have shown the medication's clinical benefits in those with severe cases, its effect in patients with moderate disease has not been examined. </p>

<p>For the new study, published in JAMA, the team looked at 584 patients with moderate cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p>

<p>One-third of the patients received a five-day course, one-third received a 10-day course and the remaining were given standard care.  </p>

<p>The patients were at 105 hospitals in the US, Europe, and Asia, and were followed for a little less than two weeks.</p>

<p>The median length of treatment was five days for patients in the five-day remdesivir group and six days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. </p>

<p>Those treated with remdesivir for five days were much better by day 11 than the standard care group, but the authors said this 'was of uncertain clinical importance.'</p>

<p>However, the group that received the drug for an average of six days did not differ from standard care group</p>

<p>What's more, death rates didn't vary between the 10-day group and those who didn't get the treatment with two percent in each group dying. </p>

<p>Researchers say that patient receiving remdesivir did have fewer severe symptoms of the virus, they had more moderate symptoms and side effects such as headache and nausea.</p>

<p>The team says its not sure why there was such a difference but plant to evaluate these discrepancies in further trials. </p>

<p>'Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment,' the authors wrote.</p>

<p>'Patients randomized to a [five]-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.'</p>

<p>In a linked editorial, physicians from UPMC Health System say there have now been three studies of remdesivir in hospitalized patients - the current study, the NIH study and a study from China - with differing results.</p>

<p>'[This raises] the question of whether the discrepancies are [due to] study design choices, including patient populations, or whether the drug is less efficacious than hoped,' Drs Erin McCreary and Derek C. Angus wrote. </p>

<p>In June, Gilead announced it would be charging governments of developed countries $2,340 for a five-day course. McCreary and Angus say the new results suggest remdesivir may not be worth the cost.</p>
