<p>The 31-year-old adventurer - who will decide between finalists Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska during Thursday night's finale - told TV Week on Monday he was '110,000 per cent in love' with his winner.</p>

<p>'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to speak about his girlfriend. 'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.'</p>

<p>Speaking out: The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (pictured) has shut down rumours he's no longer dating his winning contestant, saying he's happily in love with his chosen contestant and can't wait to 'tell people how great she is'</p>

<p>Shutting down speculation he split from his winner during COVID-19 lockdown, he added: 'I'm so happy and all I want to do is tell people how great she is.'</p>

<p>Locky's comment about 'how great' his partner sounds innocuous but could be a spoiler: Irena is working as a frontline nurse during the coronavirus pandemic and his remark suggests he doesn't just love his partner, but also admires her.</p>

<p>By contrast, Bella's job as a marketing consultant and Instagram influencer doesn't command the same degree of respect.</p>

<p>Still together: Shutting down speculation he split from his winner during COVID-19 lockdown, Locky added: 'I'm so happy and all I want to do is tell people how great she is.' Pictured: Irena</p>

<p>While Locky admitted he hadn't 'been able to catch up much' with his girlfriend since shooting the finale in July - he lives in Perth and both his finalists are based on the east coast - he made it clear they were still together.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, he concluded: 'It will be amazing [after Thursday] to just be in public together and have a normal relationship. It seems small, but I can't wait to just go for a walk together and grab a coffee.</p>

<p>'I'm over the moon and can't wipe the smile off my face. I couldn't be happier and can't wait to share it with the world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, bookies' favourite Irena also shared details about her connection with Locky in an interview with the same magazine.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old nurse said: 'I knew I had fallen for him when I couldn't imagine my future without him... I feel very safe and warm when I'm with him.'</p>

<p>She also revealed they had discussed having children, saying: 'I think [Locky] would be a fun, but very protective, dad. He would be the parent that let the kids get away with everything.'</p>

<p>Irena is the favourite to win Locky's heart on The Bachelor, with odds of $1.30 as of Monday morning. By contrast, Bella is sitting at $3.25.</p>
