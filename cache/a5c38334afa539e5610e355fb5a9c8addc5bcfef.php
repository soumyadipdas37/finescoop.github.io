<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cricket was mourning the death of David Capel on Wednesday, the former Northamptonshire all-rounder who was part of England's four-man seam attack during their unlikely assault on the Caribbean in 1989-90. He was 57, and had undergone surgery for a brain tumour in October 2018.</p>

<p>Capel was an old-school English swashbuckler, a seamer who threw himself at the crease and collected 546 first-class wickets (his first championship victim was Geoffrey Boycott), and an occasionally destructive middle-order batsman who managed more than 12,000 runs and 16 centuries. And if he never lived up to the impossible tag of the 'new Botham', he had a few days in the sun during 15 Tests and 23 one-day internationals between 1987 and 1990.</p>

<p>On Test debut against Pakistan at Headingley, he walked out to bat with England in tatters at 31 for five against Imran Khan and Wasim Akram, and top-scored with 53, adding 54 with Botham. Later that year in Karachi, he made 98 in over six hours on a turning track against leg-spinner Abdul Qadir.</p>

<p>David Capel passed away aged 57 - and had undergone surgery for a brain tumour in 2018</p>

<p>Two years later, Capel was part of Graham Gooch's new-look England team who took a 1-0 lead over the all-conquering West Indians in Jamaica, and would have gone 2-0 up with two to play had the home side not slowed their over-rate to eight an hour on the final afternoon in Trinidad. Among his 21 Tests victims was Viv Richards – three times – and Australia's Allan Border and Dean Jones, twice each.</p>

<p>After nearly two decades as a popular player at Wantage Road, he moved into coaching, replacing Kepler Wessels in the Northamptonshire job in 2006, before becoming assistant coach of the England women's team and head coach of Bangladesh women, a position he held for 18 months until 2018. Above all, he was one of the most well-loved figures on the county circuit.</p>

<p>'Very sad to hear my former team mate passed from a long suffering illness,' tweeted his former England and county colleague Allan Lamb. 'David Capel, all round person and a true gentleman both on and off the field, we are going to miss you buddy.'</p>

<p>ECB chief executive Tom Harrison, another Northamptonshire team-mate, told the club's website: 'This is hugely shocking and sad news for the English cricket family and particularly those connected with Northants CCC. David was one of the finest all-rounders of his era and spent an astonishing 33 years at Wantage Rd.</p>

<p>'I had the privilege of playing with David, a hugely competitive and determined cricketer who was never beaten – an attitude he took into his battle with his illness. A complex and private man on the surface, a kind and gentle one to those who knew him well. I will miss his friendship.'</p>

<p>Capel played 15 Tests and 23 one-day internationals for England between 1987 and 1990</p>
