<p>'That was a pretty momentous moment in my career,' he said. 'The fact that Scorsese was directing. All of a sudden Bob came into the project.</p>

<p>He recalled: 'My mother was sick with cancer and died in the middle of us filming. The fact that that was going on made me less intimidated by the situation, I believe, because I was thinking, "My mother is dying of cancer. I am going to come here and be afraid of a guy who is an actor?"'</p>
