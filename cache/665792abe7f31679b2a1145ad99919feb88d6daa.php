<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A football coach's daughter has triggered a heart stopping moment for WAGS and their families after changing the channel in the dying stages of a vital match.</p>

<p>Geelong Cats legend Corey Enright's daughter Luna was videoed pulling the plug on a TV in an adorable moment during their crunch match against the Sydney Swans on Sunday.</p>

<p>The one-year-old was watching the last game of the season with other families in the AFL's Gold Coast hub on Sunday, with her dad's old team needing a win to book in a top-four spot in the finals. </p>

<p>The Cats had fought back from a 17-point deficit to claim the lead in the final stages, leaving the diehard supporters on the edge of their seats.</p>

<p>That was when young Luna decided to change the channel. </p>

<p>Luna Enright (pictured left) changed the channel in the Geelong Cats AFL hub at the end of their match against the Sydney Swans on Sunday</p>

<p>When the Swans fought back with a late charge and kicked a crucial goal in the final two minutes, they were within range of stealing victory and breaking Cats hearts.</p>

<p>With only 19 seconds remaining in the final quarter and the Swans behind by six points with the ball in hand, Luna wandered over to the TV set.</p>

<p>She fumbled with the TV box and changed the channel, sending the crowd into hysterics.</p>

<p>Her mother Renee rushed over to change the channel back, before accidentally putting on a rugby league match.</p>

<p>Despite Luna's bungle, the crowd were elated when the Cats hung on for the win. Pictured: Geelong development coach Corey Enright with his wife Renee and children Luna, Tex and Boh</p>

<p>Luna's mother Renee ran over to change the channel back, with only 19 seconds left in the match</p>

<p>The families endured an agonising wait, with WAGS and children screaming as Mrs Enright scrolled through the TV channels.</p>

<p>After she finally found the broadcast, the final score lit up on the scream, sending a deafening roar through the hub.</p>

<p>Footage of the dramatic moment was posted on AFL's Instagram page, with commentators loving Luna's cute display.</p>
