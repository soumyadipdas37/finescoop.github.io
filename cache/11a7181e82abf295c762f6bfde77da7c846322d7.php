<p>Heading into a meeting: She pulls on her gray blazer as she walks through an office</p>

<p>Then Jennifer is in a black halter top with diamond earrings; she is in a Rolls-Royce then she puts her feet up as if she is in some kind of meeting.  </p>

<p>She changes up her hair looks almost daily - in the morning she can have short locks and later that night it's down to her bottom. But in this clip she has curls on top of her head. </p>

<p>Not a work look: She sits with her feet up in an office building with men in suits behind her</p>

<p>Next it is all about Maluma as he models different outfits. </p>

<p>Lopez shared in her Instagram caption: 'My two song collaboration Pa’ Ti - Lonely with <?php echo e('@'); ?>Maluma is almost here! ✨ Don’t miss the <?php echo e('@'); ?>TikTok Live: Behind the Video and two-part premiere event this Thursday at 6pm EST / 3pm PST. It all starts on TikTok.'</p>

<p>The Bronx beauty's next film Marry Me with Maluma and Owen opens on February 12, 2021. It's a romantic comedy directed by Kat Coiro.</p>

<p>According to the film's website, J-Lo plays musical superstar Kat Valdez.</p>

<p>Owen Wilson is Charlie Gilbert, a math teacher, and they are 'total strangers who agree to marry and then get to know each other.'</p>

<p>The film is an 'unlikely romance about two different people searching for something real in a world where value is based on likes and followers, Marry Me is a modern love story about celebrity, marriage and social media.</p>

<p>'Kat Valdez (Lopez) is half of the sexiest celebrity power couple on Earth with hot new music supernova Bastian (Maluma, making his feature-film debut). As Kat and Bastian’s inescapable hit single, “Marry Me,” climbs the charts, they are about to be wed before an audience of their fans in a ceremony that will streamed across multiple platforms.'</p>

<p>Beso time: Lopez and Maluma - who have 25 years between them - are about to kiss as she caresses his face</p>

<p>Lip locking? In the opening the World Of Dance star leans on the handsome crooner and later it looks as if she was about to kiss him</p>

<p>But then things change when divorced high-school math teacher Charlie Gilbert (Owen Wilson) has been dragged to the concert by his daughter Lou (Chloe Coleman, HBO’s Big Little Lies) and his best friend (Sarah Silverman). </p>

<p>'When Kat learns, seconds before the ceremony, that Bastian has cheated on her with her assistant, her life turns left as she has a meltdown on stage, questioning love, truth and loyalty. As her gossamer world falls away, she locks eyes with a stranger—a face in the crowd.</p>

<p>In a moment of 'inspired insanity,' Kat chooses to marry Charlie. </p>

<p>'What begins as an impulsive reaction evolves into an unexpected romance. But as forces conspire to separate them, the universal question arises: Can two people from such different worlds bridge the gulf between them and build a place where they both belong?'</p>

<p>New connection: On Monday a first teaser for her new music video for Pa' Ti the 51-year-old performer is seen getting very steamy with 26-year-old Colombian singer Maluma</p>

<p>And he will be in her next movie: Maluma will also be in her 2021 romantic comedy film Marry Me with Owen Wilson </p>
