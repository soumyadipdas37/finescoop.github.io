<p>The Nigerian-born, Maryland-raised 36-year-old got fully glam to compete for the outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series trophy during the virtual ABC telecast.</p>

<p>Yvonne went head to head against seven other actresses for the Emmy, which ultimately went to Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy. </p>

<p>'Nuff said!' Insecure actress Yvonne Orji enlisted groomer Mickey West-Potts to shave the Black Lives Matter fist onto the side of her head for the 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards on Sunday night</p>

<p>Orji got on the rooftop of an Atlanta hotel to pose in her Azzi &amp; Osta gown, Christian Louboutin heels, and David Yurman jewelry selected by stylist Apuje Kalu.</p>

<p>The Momma, I Made It comedian had the rest of her pixie cut coiffed by hairstylist Mary Daniels and make-up artist/esthetician Drini Marie made sure she was ready for her Zoom close-up.</p>

<p>Win or lose, Yvonne was certainly ready to party at the hotel with five others, even rolling out a red carpet.</p>

<p>'Because I don't know how not to be extra,' Orji - who boasts 1.3M social media followers - said via Instastory. </p>

<p>Excited: The Nigerian-born, Maryland-raised 36-year-old got fully glam to compete for the outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series trophy during the virtual ABC telecast</p>

<p>Better luck next year? Yvonne went head to head against seven other actresses for the Emmy, which ultimately went to Schitt's Creek star Annie Murphy (pictured)</p>

<p>Fierce! Orji got on the rooftop of an Atlanta hotel to pose in her Azzi &amp; Osta gown, Christian Louboutin heels, and David Yurman jewelry selected by stylist Apuje Kalu</p>

<p>Werrrk! The Momma, I Made It comedian had the rest of her pixie cut coiffed by hairstylist Mary Daniels and make-up artist Drini Marie made sure she was ready for her Zoom close-up</p>

<p>'Because I don't know how not to be extra!' Win or lose, Yvonne was certainly ready to party at the hotel with five others, even rolling out a red carpet</p>

<p>'This is what's happening guys. My new name is Emmy Ma. Ask about me. I have the dopest friends. This is a thing that's happening. And I told you I was getting a red carpet!'</p>

<p>The George Washington University grad - who vows to remain a virgin until marriage - was sad her parents could not be with her but they only landed in the States on Sunday.</p>

<p>Yvonne famously scored the role of Issa Dee's (Issa Rae) promiscuous lawyer best friend Molly Carter in Insecure without an agent or any real acting experience.</p>

<p>HBO officially renewed Insecure for a fifth season in May, and the cast reunited virtually last Wednesday for the first table read.</p>
