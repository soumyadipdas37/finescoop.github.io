<p>Business as usual: Newly single Love Island star Laura Anderson was in good spirits as she headed to meetings in London on Wednesday</p>

<p>Her day out in London comes just days after she sparked controversy with her 'changing face'.</p>

<p>The star has been posting a string of makeup-free snaps with no filters after a photo shared online sparked shocked comments.</p>

<p>Hitting back at hurtful comments with a make-up free selfie a day later, Laura said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.</p>

<p>'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse. </p>

<p>'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. </p>

<p>Looking good: The reality star showed off her long legs with her lace-up black boots which she paired with a sporty cream and black jacket and glam makeup</p>

<p>Head held high: Laura's day out in London comes just days after she sparked controversy with her 'changing face'.</p>

<p>'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'    </p>

<p>Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.</p>

<p>One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! </p>

<p>Another typed: 'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!,' while a third chimed: 'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)</p>

<p>Natural: The star has been sharing a string of makeup-free snaps with no filters after a photo shared online sparked shocked comments </p>

<p>Another follower referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   </p>

<p>The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018.  </p>

<p>It's been a tough time for Laura who revealed earlier this month that she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom just days after moving back to Scotland.</p>

<p>Despite initially intending for Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.  </p>

<p>Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north.</p>

<p>Abuse: Laura had been filming Love Island spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George when a photo shared by her co-stars saw fans branding her recognisable </p>

<p>'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.'</p>

<p>Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.</p>

<p>Laura, who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow earlier in the month, said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.</p>

<p>She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'</p>

<p>It's over: It's been a tough time for Laura who revealed earlier this month that she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom just days after moving back to Scotland</p>
