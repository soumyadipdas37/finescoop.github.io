<p>But a new video indicates that neither one of the two will win Locky Gilbert's heart, meaning that Irena Srbinovska is most likely Locky's final girl.</p>

<p>In a video shared to the Bachie Funny meme account, Bec and Bella are shown enjoying a viewing party of The Bachelor with their friends and family.</p>

<p>Surprise: Bec Cvilikas (pictured) and Bella Varelis held a Bachelor viewing party this week, leading some to believe that neither of them will end up with Locky Gilbert </p>

<p>While Bella herself isn't shown in the video, she is tagged.</p>

<p>If Bella and Bec are close enough to be friends and have viewing parties together, it indicates that they may not have ended up with Locky. </p>

<p>'Intruder Bec watching last night's ep with Bella and Bella's friends and family,' Bachie Funny captioned the video.</p>

<p>'A lot of you are messaging to say they now live together. Wouldn't be doing that if either had won hey,' they added.</p>

<p>In the latest teaser for the series, the two frontrunners clash in a bitter argument seemingly over their feelings for Locky Gilbert.</p>

<p>'Irena, I don't trust you anymore, I'm sorry,' Bella tells the clearly agitated nurse, who says she also also no longer 'trusts' Bella.</p>

<p>'Great. Friendship done. I'm over your bullsh<em>t to be honest. You're a manipulative little bi</em>ch,' Bella tells her, as she does a walk off.</p>

<p>Drama: Bella, 25, and Irena Srbinovska, 31, are set for a fiery confrontation as the ladies head back to the mansion on Thursday's episode of The Bachelor</p>

<p>Bella's animosity towards nurse Irena is on full display as she confesses the nurse 'grinds my gears' after seeing her at the cocktail party.</p>

<p>'I'm not stoked to see her,' Bella says.</p>

<p>Irena seems perplexed by the sudden acrimonious behaviour, with the two women previously friends in the mansion.</p>

<p>'Bella decided that our friendship was done,' Irena says, with her then shown saying: 'It's hurt me so bad.'</p>
