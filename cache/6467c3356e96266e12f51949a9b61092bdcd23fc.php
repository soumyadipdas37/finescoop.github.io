<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pregnant Ashley James has slammed Boris Johnson over Covid-19 rules that force women to give birth alone and without their partners.</p>

<p>The former Made In Chelsea star, 33, told MailOnline she expected more from the Prime Minister after he became a father again in April when fiancée Carrie Symonds gave birth to a baby boy.</p>

<p>Ashley, who is expecting her first baby in January with boyfriend Tommy Andrews, 30, said the current ban on partners at the bedside during births has left her feeling 'apprehensive' but she's trying not to over worry for the sake of her unborn child.</p>

<p>'It's frustrating': Pregnant Ashley James has slammed Boris Johnson over Covid-19 rules that force women to give birth alone and without their partners </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview, Ashley said: 'The thing I am most apprehensive about, which again we can't change, is what's going to happen with Covid and whether Tommy is going to be allowed in the hospital.</p>

<p>'The frustrating thing is that people are allowed to go to the pub and get on tubes and go to offices.</p>

<p>'Why can't you have one person from your household in something like labour?</p>

<p>'You would think as well that Boris would be sympathetic towards that given his partner has just had a baby.</p>

<p>'Apprehensive': The TV star is expecting her first baby with partner Tommy Andrews, who may not be allowed in hospital if the law remains the same when Ashley gives birth next year</p>

<p>'No sympathy': Ashley told MailOnline she expected more from the Prime Minister after he became a father again in April when fiancée Carrie Symonds gave birth to a baby boy </p>

<p>'I'm sure if it had been him that had the baby and had to go through labour then he would have thought a bit more about it.</p>

<p>'There isn't really much point in me worrying because it is what it is.'</p>

<p>It was reported on Sunday that more than 60 MPs are now demanding NHS Trusts lift the ban, as new mothers have been left 'devastated' over having to give birth without loved ones by their side.</p>

<p>The Mail on Sunday launched a campaign this weekend to stop the practice, which has also led to patients being forced to attend stressful hospital appointments on their own.</p>

<p>New government rules that were introduced this week, which limit families to only meet in groups of up to six, have also impacted Ashley, who planned to spend time with loved ones this weekend ahead of the arrival of her baby.</p>

<p>'Worrying': The former Made In Chelsea star, who's expecting a baby boy, suspects that Boris would have given the matter more thought if it had been him giving birth </p>

<p>She said: 'It's been a challenging year no matter our circumstances, even with these new guidelines that have come into place.</p>

<p>'We were supposed to be going up north to see my parents and grandma for the first time and seeing my siblings because I'm not going to be there for Christmas as I'm due.</p>

<p>'But now as there will be seven of us… we're either going to have to cut someone from the family or not be able to meet.</p>

<p>'Hopefully next year we will have fewer restrictions and be able to see the people that we love.'</p>

<p>Rules: The DJ has also been let down by new government guidelines that restrict families to only meet in groups of up to six people, after hoping to visit her loved ones this weekend </p>

<p>Ashley is already keen to try for a second baby with partner Tommy after speaking openly about longing for a daughter and the 'shame' of having a desired sex when falling pregnant.</p>

<p>The DJ and influencer said: 'I keep saying to Tommy, please can we have another baby as soon as the first one is born?</p>

<p>'I'm probably blissfully ignorant about the challenges of a newborn so I might feel differently once I'm going through sleepless nights.</p>

<p>'I don't want to overload us with dreams of a daughter before we experience what we're getting ourselves into.</p>

<p>'Also there's no guarantee that it will be a daughter and I need to think about things before I end up with an army of children.'</p>

<p>'Please can we have another baby?': Ashley is already planning to have a second baby with Tommy, after admitting that she would love to have a daughter one day </p>

<p>Ashley has teamed up with water brand Evian to highlight the importance of staying hydrated throughout pregnancy. </p>

<p>In Ashley's case it is paramount for her to keep on top of her fluids, after the expectant mother fell ill with sepsis in 2018.</p>

<p>Ashley explained: 'Since having sepsis I notice that my kidneys really ache if I'm not drinking enough water. The midwife said I should look out for any issues around kidneys during my pregnancy.</p>

<p>'Lockdown has allowed me to really focus on hydration – it plays such a big part in my life. </p>

<p>'I also get a lot of questions online about my skin but it's almost secondary what products you use when the primary thing is drinking enough water.'</p>
