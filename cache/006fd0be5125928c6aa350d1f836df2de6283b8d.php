<p>The Britain's Got Talent duo, both 44, claimed the colt - which they bought together in 2013 - wasn't even a thoroughbred but just a normal horse. </p>

<p>In an online chat to promote their new book, Once Upon A Tyne, Dec said: 'It was awful, it was a dreadfully slow horse. It wasn't a racehorse it was just a horse, 'cos it didn't race.</p>

<p>Looking back: Ant and Dec have revealed that owning a £35,000 racehorse with Simon Cowell was 'awful'</p>

<p>'Every time we got to the BGT studio Simon would say, 'I keep paying stable fees on this horse, but I've never seen it run'.'</p>

<p>They also said that Simon originally wanted to name the animal after himself, but they eventually settled on It's A Yes From Me. </p>

<p>Revealing its eventual fate, Dec mused: 'I think it got rehomed.' </p>

<p>The pair are currently celebrating their 30-year career in television with the release of their book Once Upon A Tyne.</p>

<p>Sharing an insight into their new project earlier this month Ant said: 'We wanted it to be like a conversation and us talking through a story. Every chapter will be about a show we work on and the backstage stories of them.' </p>

<p>On their time in the spotlight, Dec said: 'It feels like it's gone in the blink of an eye. It bizarrely feels like we're only getting started. I don't think you ever feel like, 'oh I've made it.'</p>

<p>'There is an element that someone will knock on the door and say that well it was meant to be for someone else and we go, "oh, okay."</p>

<p>'We love it, we're very lucky to be involved in three of the biggest shows on TV. We love working together, we love each other and being together and working together.'</p>

<p>The TV stars also revealed during a rare interview on This Morning that they're tested for coronavirus every four days in order to present their much-loved shows together.</p>

<p>The pair kicked off their segment by hugging on air as they explained why they don't need to keep a social distance from each other. </p>

<p>Removing their protective face masks, Dec shared: 'We don't need these with each other. We're in a cohort!', while Ant added: 'We're working on BGT and other things so we get tested every four or five days so.</p>

<p>'We form a cohort with our households. We have to be careful of where we go and who we see. Nothing new there!' </p>
