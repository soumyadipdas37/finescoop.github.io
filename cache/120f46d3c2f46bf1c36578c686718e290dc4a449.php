<p>Antonio Robinson, 22, and Jarvis Baker-Flanders, 23, are accused of killing Alana Washington in a drive-by shooting outside her home in Brownsville, Florida, on July 25.</p>

<p>Three other people, including a two-year-old, were injured as the family returned from a trip to a flea market.</p>

<p>Alana's brother is believed to have been their intended target after he was involved in some kind of dispute with the suspects, Fernandez Rundle said.</p>

<p>'She was cut down in a hail of bullets clearly intended to settle a grievance, to settle a score, to make a point,' the State Attorney said. 'Her death is senseless.'</p>

<p>Baker-Flanders was the shooter and Robinson the driver, she added.</p>

<p>An anonymous tip-off led to their arrests. </p>
