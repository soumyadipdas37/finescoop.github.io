<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has claimed she spotted a cat 'bigger than a Great Dane' walking by her house when she looked back over her CCTV.</p>

<p>Sandy Bawa captured images of a black cat-like creature outside her home in Eastbourne just before 6am on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>She thought it was 'some sort of wild cat' and has been looking at her CCTV footage daily to try to see it again.</p>

<p>Ms Bawa told the Eastbourne Herald: 'It's bigger than a Great Dane dog and the face is like a cat.'</p>

<p>She added that it looked 'very weak' and she wasn't afraid of it walking so close to her house.</p>

<p>Sandy Bawa captured images of a black cat-like creature (pictured) outside her home in Eastbourne just before 6am on Sunday morning</p>

<p>A photograph taken from the CCTV showed a black figure appear to walk along the path outside her seafront home.</p>

<p>She showed the footage to her friend Ann Newton-Mercial, who said she thought it might have been a horse when she first saw it. </p>

<p> 'It does look big. The wall in front of her house isn’t very large,' she said.</p>

<p>It comes after a wildlife expert revealed there could be as many as 500 wild big cats roaming the UK. </p>

<p>Big cats have been spotted in different locations around the UK over the past twenty years</p>

<p>Rick Minter, who worked as a policy officer for the Countryside Commission and then the Countryside Agency for 18 years, said he believes there could be around 250 black leopards and 250 pumas in the wild.</p>

<p>There have been claimed sightings of big cats in the British countryside for decades, captured with blurry photographs, but there has been little evidence, The Times reported.</p>

<p>Overall, there have been more than 1,300 big cat sightings across the UK in the last 10 years.</p>

<p>Mr Minter said that, because of the consistency of sightings, lack of signs on inbreeding and skill at deer hunting, around 80 per cent of the reports he received were credible.</p>

<p>He said most of the witnesses and informants are reliable people, such as police officers and scientists.</p>

<p>On August 9, a large wildcat resembling a Savannah cat was caught on camera around 4pm wandering across Coldham's Common in central Cambridge.</p>
