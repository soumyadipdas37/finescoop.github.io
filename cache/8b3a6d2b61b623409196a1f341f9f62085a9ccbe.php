<p>'Dave was always the person we looked to to deal with difficult issues and he was a master at that. He never let students get away with being anything other than their very best, never giving up on them, even when at times it felt as though they wanted to give up on themselves. </p>

<p>'All of this, Dave did with a smile and a level of kindness and care that is seldom seen.</p>

<p>According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Clark was educated at Jordanhill College in Glasgow and was a keen cyclist, swimmer and rugby coach </p>

<p>'Our students and their parents have been lucky to have known and been helped by him. We have been privileged as a staff to have worked with him and will continue working in the same way in his memory.</p>

<p>'Above all, Dave was a family man. Our thoughts are with Dave's wife, his children and wider family at this difficult time.' </p>

<p>'Dave was killed as a result of an accident as he walked his dogs in the countryside.</p>

<p>'Dave worked at Richmond School for 23 years and was the heart and soul of the school, taking such pride in his very important work.</p>

<p>'Dave was not only an admired colleague, he was also a much loved friend and member of the local community and I know that many of you, as parents, will have very fond memories of being taught by him.' </p>

<p>One parent said that all four of his children had known Mr Clark over the years and spoke very highly of him.</p>

<p>Another said: 'He was really popular, one of the good guys. It's just incredibly sad. He'd been there forever - even when pupils had left he remembered their names and would ask how they were doing.'</p>

<p>His local cycling club paid tribute to him on Facebook, saying: It is with immense sadness that we learned today that one of the club's most respected and long standing members, David Clark passed away due to a tragic accident. </p>

<p>'David was walking with his dogs on the outskirts of the town, off the town's Hurgill Road, on Monday evening when the incident happened. </p>

<p>'Our thoughts are with David's family and friends who must be devastated and within the club there is deep sadness and shock.'</p>
