<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian bookstore has banned the Harry Potter series to make the shop a 'safer space'. </p>

<p>Rabble Books and Games, in Maylands, Perth, announced on Wednesday it would cease stocking JK Rowling novels after she was accused of transphobia over her latest book.</p>

<p>Owner Nat Latter said on Facebook the store would 'not put books by transphobes on the shelves' and asked customers for suggested alternatives.</p>

<p>'Whilst stocking a book isn't an endorsement (good grief, that would be a minefield), and we will always take orders for books that aren't in stock, there are more worthy books to put on the shelf, books that don't harm communities and won't make us sad to unpack them,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'We are always trying to make Rabble a safer space for our community, and part of that is trying not to put books by transphobes on the shelves, when we know about them.'      </p>

<p>Rowling has been criticised for her views on transgender people since tweeting her support for a researcher who was sacked for her own views on the topic.</p>

<p>In June the bestselling author made headlines again after she mocked an online article on Twitter for using the words 'people who menstruate' instead of 'women'.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old was hit by what she described as 'relentless attacks' after writing: 'I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?'</p>

<p>The acclaimed novelist's remarks sparked backlash from celebrities including Daniel Radcliffe (centre), Rupert Grint (left), Emma Watson (right) and Eddie Redmayne, who all starred in Rowling's Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts movies</p>

<p>Rowling became embroiled in another trans row on Sunday after an early review of the her latest novel, Troubled Blood, by The Telegraph revealed it featured a 'transvestite serial killer' who wore women's clothing while murdering his victims.</p>

<p>The review caused some social media users to label Troubled Blood as 'transphobic' and 'really painful' - and the backlash caused #RIPJKRowling to trend on Twitter. </p>

<p>Others said the book is not transphobic at all and over-eager detractors should read it before jumping to conclusions. </p>

<p>Mailonline columnist Piers Morgan added: 'The fact #RIPJKRowling is trending says all you need to know about the woke brigade - they're nastier and more viciously intolerant than anyone they preach about.' </p>
