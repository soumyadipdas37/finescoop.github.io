<p>A source told The Sun at the time: 'It's all over. They started to grow apart. They want to remain civil with each other and hope to remain friends.'</p>

<p>The news likely came as a shock to their fans, as just a week before they called it quits, they revealed that they were enjoying their time in lockdown together.</p>

<p>Speaking to OK! Online, Wes said: 'It's been alright. It's hard to get out at the moment, isn't it? We're just trying to do our piece of exercise a day.'</p>

<p>Last week Arabella set tongues-wagging when she packed on the PDA with a new mystery new man in Ibiza.</p>

<p>The star enjoyed a sun-soaked beach day with her new love on Thursday, just weeks after going public with Josh and four months after splitting from Wes. </p>
