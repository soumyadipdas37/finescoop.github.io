<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A New York City man was charged after a three-year-old girl he was babysitting fell unconscious, and he surpassed a nearby hospital to drive hours away to a center in Queens.   </p>

<p>New York Police Department officers dispatched to a call about a dead young child named Jaylynn Evans who was brought to Cohen Children’s Medical Center around 7.15pm. </p>

<p>PIX 11 reports that officers were informed that Anthony Richardson, of the Bronx, had brought the little girl to the facility while she was unconscious and unresponsive.</p>

<p>There were no signs of obvious trauma, police told Pix 11.</p>

<p>Jaylynn Evans (pictured), a three-year-old girl in New York City, died on Thursday evening after she became unconscious and unresponsive </p>

<p>Some reports have said the girl may have been infected with COVID-19 at the time, but the Medical Examiner will determine the official cause of death. </p>

<p>The child's mother had reportedly left her under the care of Richardson, who is the father of mother's best friend. </p>

<p>According to New York Daily News, Richardson had been watching Jaylynn and another four-year-old child at his Mott Haven home.</p>

<p>The two children were watching TV and eating snacks when Jaylynn suddenly fell ill.</p>

<p>Anthony Richardson drove Jaylynn to Cohen Children’s Medical Center (pictured) in Queens from the Bronx but the trip took hours, authorities said</p>

<p>Although Lincoln Medical Center (pictured) is under a mile away from Richardson's home, he reportedly felt the child would receive better treatment at a different medical center</p>

<p>Richardson reportedly did not immediately call 911 or drive the child to Lincoln Medical Center under one mile away. </p>

<p>Instead, he loaded the children into his vehicle and drove nearly 20 miles out of the Bronx to Cohen’s Children’s Medical Center in Queens. The trip, authorities told NYDN, took hours. </p>

<p>When asked why he took Jaylynn to a hospital miles away, Pix 11 reports that Richardson told authorities he felt the nearby hospital was not as good and the child could get better service elsewhere.</p>

<p>Richardson was subsequently charged with acting in a manner injurious to a child under the age of 17.  </p>
