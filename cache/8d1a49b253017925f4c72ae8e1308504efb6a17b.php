<p>Details of a letter from Williamson to the England forward — responding to the player’s heartfelt request to deal with a crisis affecting millions of impoverished British children — are to be revealed by the BBC on Saturday.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands that Rashford feels a lack of empathy falls way short of what he had hoped for. The BBC would not disclose the details of the Williamson letter ahead of Saturday's broadcast. But it is understood that it merely outlines what the Conservative party have done for children while in power.</p>

<p>It has been viewed as an unexpectedly cold and dismissive response to what the 22-year-old Manchester United forward considers to be an existential crisis for impoverished British children, rather than simply a Covid-related problem.</p>

<p>Williamson is not scheduled to appear on BBC Breakfast when contents of the letter will be revealed on Saturday. Instead, the presenters will be joined by Conservative MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Education select committee, to discuss the issue.</p>
