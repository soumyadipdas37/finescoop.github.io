<p>An investigation was launched after the man was hospitalized having consumed engine antifreeze.</p>

<p>The liquid was mistaken for a drink inside a bottle, according to Huffpost.  </p>

<p>The carer had accompanied the man to the hospital in June 2019, where he remained in a serious condition for a long period of time. </p>

<p>The investigation by the Compagnia di Susa police found it was very likely the carer had tricked the man into drinking the fluid.</p>

<p>In 2016 the carer had taken the elderly man to notary and persuaded him to give her the ownership of her home.</p>

<p>The man had not understood what had happened, and the carer feared she would lose the home when a  support administrator challenged her on the situation.    </p>
