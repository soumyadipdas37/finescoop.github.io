<p>On Friday, she took her outfit to another level with a classy black and white ensemble for a night out with friends.</p>

<p>One could mistake her ensemble for something inspired by a nun's habit - but it was far from it. </p>

<p>She posted a mirror selfie of her outfit - a long black dress with a white neckline trim and cut out details on the waist, teamed with a cropped bomber jacket and completed her look with a pair of white boots.</p>

<p>Pip's avant garde ensemble comes after she recently shared a sweet photo of herself cuddled up to Michael inside his designer closet this week.   </p>
