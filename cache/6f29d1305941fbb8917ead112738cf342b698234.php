<p>Another viewer added: 'I've already given up on The Singapore Grip. Couldn't get into it, despite a strong cast. Need another Downton Abbey or The Durrells for the perfect Sunday night viewing to get me watching.'</p>

<p>'I can't be alone in not having a clue about what's happening? It's bizarre,' a third unimpressed Twitter user wrote.</p>

<p>'I was quite looking forward to this series, but I am really struggling to get into the first episode,' another said. </p>

<p>While a fifth wrote: 'Managed the first 30 minutes of #TheSingaporeGrip (although 20 of those were under sufferance). I certainly shan't be bothering with any more.' </p>
