<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Protesters have blocked the entrance to the hospital where the two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies ambushed in a shooting Saturday are fighting for their lives, chanting: 'We hope they f***ing die.'</p>

<p>The officers, a male and female officer with the Transit Services Bureau, were shot at the Metro Blue Line station at Willowbrook Avenue and Oak Street in Compton by a male suspect who then fled the scene, local outlets report. </p>

<p>Donald Trump on Sunday said the man who opened fire should face a 'fast trial death penalty' if the deputies die. He earlier called the shooter an 'animal' who needed to be 'hit hard' as the FBI was called in to help investigate.</p>

<p>The president tweeted: 'If they die, fast trial death penalty for the killer. Only way to stop this!' </p>

<p>Shameful footage said to have been taken outside the hospital Saturday night shows as one protester yells: 'I want to deliver a message to the family of the pigs, I hope they f***ing die.' The protesters have been connected to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter but that has not been officially confirmed.  </p>

<p>On Sunday the LA county sheriffs office tweeted: 'To the protesters blocking the entrance &amp; exit of the HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM yelling "We hope they die" referring to 2 LA Sheriff's ambushed today in #Compton: DO NOT BLOCK EMERGENCY ENTRIES &amp; EXITS TO THE HOSPITAL. </p>

<p>'People's lives are at stake when ambulances can't get through.'   </p>
