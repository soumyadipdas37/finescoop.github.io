<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An ex-policeman who quit the force after admitting abducting a schoolgirl has won a battle to become a taxi driver 13 years after his conviction.</p>

<p>Imran Ali lured a 15-year-old and another girl into a vehicle after a night out in Manchester city centre in 2006.</p>

<p>The following year, the 39-year-old pleaded guilty to abducting a child under 16 at Preston Crown Court and resigned from the force having been based at Didsbury police station at the time of the offence.</p>

<p>Ali, of Merston Drive, Manchester, then applied for a private hire licence from Sefton Council in Merseyside earlier this year, even though he lived some 40 miles away.</p>

<p>Imran Ali applied for a private hire licence from Sefton Council earlier this year, but was initially turned down as he 'was not a fit and proper person'</p>

<p>Town hall chiefs turned down his application as he 'was not a fit and proper person', adding that 'driving a taxi is a privilege', the Liverpool Echo reports. </p>

<p>Ali then appealed the decision at South Sefton Magistrates Court where Trading Standards Officer Mark Toohey said the panel had to consider 'whether or not we would be satisfied with a member of our family getting into the vehicle with this person driving. And in this case we would not be.'</p>

<p>However, the court was told the applicant was remorseful and rehabilitated, having worked to deliver food parcels to the needy during the coronavirus pandemic - an act which has seen him nominated for a number of awards.</p>

<p>He added that he was managing three different charities, had built up a property portfolio with 43 tenants and recently qualified as a civil engineer.</p>

<p>When asked why he wanted to drive a taxi considering his other employment experience, Ali said it was due to the flexible working hours, which would help him be able to study for another year for a degree.</p>

<p>He added that the waiting list for a private hire licence was much shorter in Sefton than in Manchester, which he suggested was more important than the distance from his home. </p>

<p>The council follows a set of guidelines when it comes to granting licences, with individuals involved in an assault with a child given as an example of a situation that would require at least a ten year wait before such permission could be granted.</p>

<p>However, there is no such guidance on child abduction, as such cases come up so rarely, Mr Toohey said.</p>

<p>South Sefton Magistrates Court, pictured, reversed the council's decision and granted Ali his licence</p>

<p>Having heard the evidence, the court reversed the council's decision and granted Ali his licence.</p>

<p>Magistrate Keith Elford said: 'Mr Ali's conviction dates back more than 14 years. Since then, he has successfully built a business portfolio and achieved qualifications, as well as starting a family. </p>

<p>'During the Covid-19 pandemic, he has contributed significantly to the welfare of his local community.</p>

<p>'Sefton Council could not set a precedent for this type of offence. He is a fit and proper person for a taxi driver licence.'</p>
