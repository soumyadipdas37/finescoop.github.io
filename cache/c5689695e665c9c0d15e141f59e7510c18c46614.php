<p>Pirc said it supported getting rid of annual payouts unless 'an event has occurred worth of a bonus'. </p>

<p>Call for change: Pirc said it supported getting rid of annual payouts unless 'an event has occurred worth of a bonus'</p>

<p>And it claimed that long-term bonus schemes that hand executives shares – often worth millions of pounds – in exchange for hitting certain targets can still 'pay out where there is failure' and 'reward the mundane'. </p>

<p>The advisory firm suggested firms reduce the amount of variable pay provided to executives and increase fixed pay. </p>

<p>The proposals are at odds with policies followed by many listed companies, which aim to reward executives with stock – making them shareholders and 'aligning' their goals with those of other investors. </p>

<p>In its consultation paper, Pay For A New World, Pirc said this concept was 'a fallacy' because executives should see doing what is best for the company and shareholders as 'part of the job'. </p>
