<p>Frank Bosco, 18, (pictured) was sentenced in Mount Druitt Local Court on Tuesday after he pleaded guilty to taking part of a brawl against rival Greater West and Inner West gangs at Rooty Hill train station on June 12</p>

<p>The brawl only ended when Inner West gang members re-boarded the train. </p>

<p>The court was told a rivalry between the gangs started following the death of Inner West gang associate Tinorei Henri, 20, in 2018.</p>

<p>Magistrate Stephen Corry told Bosco it was lucky no one was killed during the violent attack, which sparked numerous triple zero calls. </p>

<p>'This was something where you had gone to the station as a planned exercise armed with a weapon that could potentially cause lethal injury,' Magistrate Corry  said.</p>

<p>'This happened after 4pm on a weekday afternoon where you would expect there to be large numbers of members of the public going about their day.</p>

<p>'We've seen media reports recently about this sort of affair turning into a full-blown affray where someone ends up dead, which could've happened in this case.' </p>

<p>Footage showed Bosco and other gang members arrive at the station armed with machetes, knives and hammers before confronting their rivals, who were on the train</p>

<p>Bosco's lawyer told the court his offending was sparked by the death of his grandmother and a close friend after his high school exams.</p>

<p>The teenager also apologised for his actions, which he labelled selfish after putting fear into members of the public.</p>

<p>He said commuters should be able to get on the train without issues such as this </p>

<p>Bosco pleaded guilty to affray, possessing unlawfully obtained goods and being armed with intent to commit an indictable offence.</p>

<p>He was jailed for 14 months with a non-parole period of eight months.</p>

<p>Bosco could be out of jail by January due to time already served. </p>
