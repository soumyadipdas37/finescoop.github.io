<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Los Angeles real estate listing is going viral thanks to some truly terrible Photoshopping.</p>

<p>The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom home in the neighborhood of Atwater Village seems like a great rental — so it's unclear why the agent who listed it got carried away in a photo-editing app.</p>

<p>Images show a flower pot, stools, and a sofa that quite clearly don't belong, and appear to have been inexpertly copied and pasted into the photos for reasons unknown.</p>

<p>Where'd that couch come from? A Los Angeles real estate listing is going viral thanks to some truly terrible Photoshopping</p>

<p>So strange! A photo in the kitchen shows a flower pot awkwardly edited onto the kitchen island, as well as two three-legged stools edited onto one side</p>

<p>Take two! The flower pot makes an appearance in another photo</p>

<p>The photos for 4020 Brunswick Ave. are mostly normal, showing the outside of the home, the kitchen, the bathroom, and the two bedrooms.</p>

<p>But three of the photos are inexplicably edited — and badly.</p>

<p>The first shows a flower pot awkwardly edited onto the kitchen island, as well as two three-legged stools edited onto one side.</p>

<p>The editing is so messy that a jagged line of background is visible around the legs of the stools.</p>

<p>Looks OK! The rest of the photos in the listing are totally normal</p>

<p>Bizarre: The 1,000-square-foot, two-bedroom home in the neighborhood of Atwater Village seems like a great rental</p>

<p>Regular: The photos for 4020 Brunswick Ave. are mostly normal, showing the outside of the home, the kitchen, the bathroom, and the two bedrooms</p>

<p>'Eat at the island looking into kitchen,' reads the caption, providing no explanation for the bizarre photo editing. </p>

<p>Another angle of the kitchen also has the flower pot — edited onto a different part of the island — but no stools.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a photo of one the bedrooms shows an almost entirely empty room, save for a gray loveseat that has been hastily edited in.</p>

<p>The sofa, too, has jagged lines where the copy-and-paste process was done in a hurry.</p>

<p>While the details for the listing include quite a bit of information about the home and the surrounding area, the person who shared it — whose name is listed it Brad Balduff — did not provide any explanation about the Photoshopping.</p>

<p>The listing appears to have flown under the radar until Twitter user Caitie Delaney shared screengrabs on the social media platform.  </p>

<p>Funny: Her tweet has been liked over 50,000 times, with commenters chiming in with their own retorts and edits</p>

<p>'Losing my f***ing mind at these apartment listing photos,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'This is the greatest thing I've ever seen,' wrote one.</p>

<p>'That couch is gonna scuttle away like a land crab,' wrote another. </p>

<p>'So we going to just ignore the fact that the couch is clearly a vampire? I’ll assume it’s named Nosofaratu...' wrote one, noting the fact that the edited-in couch has no reflection in the mirror behind it.  </p>

<p>Another joked that the pictures have 'strong Blues Clues vibes.' </p>
