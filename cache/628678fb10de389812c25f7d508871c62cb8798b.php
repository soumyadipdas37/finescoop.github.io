<p>A 23-year-old California woman was arrested on Sunday after she scaled an American Airlines ticket counter at Miami International Airport and tried to attack a ticketing agent on Sunday</p>

<p>The woman was irate after she was told she could not board the flight to Los Angeles because she was barefoot</p>

<p>The woman was restrained by her boyfriend after they were denied entry into the gate</p>

<p>The California couple has been identified as Brittney Mohammadi (left), 23, and her boyfriend, Manuel Arteaga (right), 26</p>

<p>‘We’re not leaving! We’re not leaving!’ Mohammadi is filmed yelling at the counter agent.</p>

<p>She then climbs over the ticket counter and appear to attempt to kick at the agent.</p>

<p>Arteaga grabs Mohammadi from behind and pulls her away from the counter so as to restrain her.</p>

<p>Mohammadi, who is slurring her words, starts yelling at the agent again before Arteaga led her away.</p>

<p>Miami-Dade police were called to the scene. Officers are seen above as Arteaga and Mohammadi are arguing with them at the terminal entrance</p>

<p>The couple could be seen taunting the officers and raising their voice while daring the cops to arrest them</p>

<p>While yelling at the officers, Arteaga is seen putting his arm around Mohammadi's neck</p>

<p>Officers then try to pry the two away from each other, prompting a scuffle</p>

<p>‘She’s high on something,’ a woman who filmed the incident from behind the ticket counter is heard saying.</p>

<p>Another video filmed on a cell phone moments later shows airport police talking with the couple at what appears to be the terminal entrance gate.</p>

<p>Mohammadi is seen being restrained by her boyfriend as she talks loudly at one of the officers.</p>

<p>Arteaga is then seen threatening to sue an unidentified individual, though the reason for this is unclear.</p>

<p>The unidentified man then walks toward his car and lets out a large dog that resembled a German Shepherd.</p>

<p>The couple appears to stare at the dog for a few moments before Miami-Dade police intervene.</p>

<p>Mohammadi is seen bottom right being detained while Arteaga is held down by three officers nearby</p>

<p>Both Mohammadi and Arteaga were hauled off to Miami-Dade County jail</p>

<p>Mohammadi is seen in handcuffs while Arteaga is pinned against the hood of a police car</p>

<p>Arteaga and Mohammadi then argue with one of the officers for several minutes. Both of them raise their voices at the officer as they accuse the other man of ‘attacking us with a dog.’</p>

<p>Arteaga, who is recording with his cell phone, taunts the officers and demands to get their badge numbers.</p>

<p>He and Mohammadi continued to raise their voices at the cops, who show restraint as the couple dares the officers to arrest them.</p>

<p>‘Are you going to arrest me?’ Mohammadi repeatedly asks one of the officers as she approaches him and makes hand gestures.</p>

<p>Arteaga is then seen trying to restrain Mohammadi by placing his arm around her neck. During the entire time, both of them are yelling at the four police officers.</p>

<p>When one of the officers comes over to warn the couple, the argument escalates.</p>

<p>Finally, the officers lose their patience and try to pry the two of them apart. It took several minutes for the officers to separate the two after a scuffle.</p>

<p>They then place handcuffs on their wrists.</p>

<p>Mohammadi told a local Miami television news station that she and her boyfriend had been drinking tequila at Voodoo Lounge before they arrived at the airport on Sunday</p>

<p>Arteaga is seen bent over the hood of a police car as an officer detains him while Mohammadi is handcuffed while lying on her stomach on the pavement while another cop watches over her.</p>

<p>Mohammadi and Arteaga were taken to Miami-Dade County Jail.</p>

<p>Arteaga was charged with disorderly conduct, battery on a police officer, resisting arrest with violence, and resisting arrest without violence.</p>

<p>Mohammadi was charged with disorderly intoxication and resisting an officer without violence.</p>

<p>‘We went through TSA, we had everything checked out, they didn’t realize she didn’t have her shoes,’ Arteaga told WSVN-TV.</p>

<p>Mohammadi was asked why she thought she would get away with attacking a ticket agent.</p>

<p>‘OK, and I get that, and I will take 100% responsibility,’ she said.</p>

<p>When asked why she thought she would be allowed on a plane without wearing shoes, she said: ‘OK, you know what? I don’t go on the airport that often.’</p>

<p>Mohammadi later admitted that before arriving at the airport, she and Arteaga were drinking tequila at the Voodoo Lounge, a rooftop bar in Miami.</p>

<p>Arteaga insisted that he tried to calm Mohammadi down during their encounter with police.</p>

<p>On her Instagram account, Mohammadi and Arteaga are seen after they apparently were released from jail.</p>

<p>Mohammadi posted a video on Wednesday showing her and Arteaga walking around South Florida and bragging about how people are noticing them on the street after the video of their airport meltdown went viral.</p>

<p>‘We’re walking around like normal civilians…and people literally are stopping us and saying: “You guys are crazy!”’ she said.</p>

<p>‘We’ve got fans out here!’</p>
