<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disgusted holidaymakers have accused a farmer of dumping 'stinking' bales of seeping silage behind their vehicles in a bid to stop people using a public car park near his land.  </p>

<p>Tourists were left stunned last week after discovering the smelly obstacles blocking vehicles at Duncansby Head public car park in Wick, Caithness, by John O'Groats.</p>

<p>Silage is made from fermented crops that farmers store in bales and 'pickle' in order to preserve them for winter months when it's hard for livestock to find their own food.</p>

<p>The local farmer is said to be furious that campers are using grass at the site near John O'Groats to pitch tents and park.</p>

<p>Tourists were left stunned last week after discovering the smelly obstacles blocking vehicles at Duncansby Head public car park in Wick, Caithness, by John O'Groats</p>

<p>Silage is made from fermented crops that farmers store in bales and 'pickle' in order to preserve them for winter months when it is hard for livestock to find their own food</p>

<p>Photos show the three 'stinking' bales positioned behind camper vans parked up near Duncansby Head Lighthouse, on the most northeasterly part of the British mainland.</p>

<p>One bale is seen with a massive split in its wrapping, revealing the putrid contents inside.</p>

<p>In the background, a few cars are seen parked up on the grass near the lighthouse while camper vans occupy bays marked 'Coaches Only'.</p>

<p>The pictures were taken by Carol Harper from Stirling, who was holidaying in the area at the time.</p>

<p>The 62-year-old shared the photos to a motorhome Facebook group on September 8 saying: 'The farmer at Duncansby Head car park is trying to put people off from parking, three stinking bales of seeping silage dotted down the middle of the car park.'</p>

<p>The images angered fellow group members who accused the farmer of 'fly tipping'.</p>

<p>One man said: 'Surely that's a fly tipping and a contamination issue.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Public car park, shouldn't be allowed.'</p>

<p>The images angered fellow group members who accused the farmer of 'fly tipping'</p>

<p>And one woman said: 'Absolutely disgraceful. That view up there is amazing, why not share? But as always one or two spoil it for everyone and someone somehow has upset the poor farmer.'</p>

<p>Another user also commented claiming that the bales had been in place for a week prior to Carol's photos.</p>

<p>Speaking today, plant nursery and garden centre worker Carol said: 'There were a few pulled faces and keeping well away from them, they were very ripe and seeping juices all down the car park.</p>

<p>'By the sound of it people have been camping around the park car, there were also a few posts up with tape on to stop people parking on the grass.</p>

<p>'It didn't put people off. It was a beautiful day and very busy, the car park was full.'</p>
