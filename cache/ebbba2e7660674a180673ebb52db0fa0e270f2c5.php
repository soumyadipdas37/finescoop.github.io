<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Abbie Chatfield has never been one to shy away discussing sexual matters on her popular podcast, It's A Lot.</p>

<p>Last month, she even provided a step-by-step guide to performing fellatio - but her expertise sparked backlash from some quarters.</p>

<p>On Friday, the 25-year-old former Bachelor star told Daily Mail Australia she had received some shocking abuse simply for offering sex tips.</p>

<p>'I got a lot of messages about that!' Abbie Chatfield exposed the nasty reactions she received from vile trolls after her detailed explanation of a raunchy sex act on her podcast</p>

<p>'I got a lot of messages around that, being like "you dirty little sl*t, you're disgusting," Abbie said.</p>

<p>But the reality TV star has brushed off the negative commentary. </p>

<p>Instead she is focusing on the positive messages she gets from women who say that Abbie's advice has really improved their relationships. </p>

<p>The critics: She told Daily Mail Australia on Friday: 'I got a lot of messages around that, being like "you dirty little s***, you're disgusting." But, the reality TV star brushed off the negative commentary from her critics </p>

<p>'I get the amazing DMs [direct messages] from girls or from boyfriends being like, "Thank you so much!"' she said.</p>

<p>'I'm like, you know, it's worth it. The good always outweighs the bad now, so [the trolling is] kind of laughable.'</p>

<p>Abbie, who has partnered with Libra for their Live Liberation Stories campaign, told Daily Mail Australia she was 'surprised' by the success of her podcast.</p>

<p>She launched It's A Lot in March, a few months after filming reality TV spin-off Bachelor in Paradise in Fiji.</p>

<p>'The good always outweighs the bad': Instead, Abbie has focused on the positive messages she gets from girls performing their act for their partner or from the male partners. 'I get the amazing DMs from girls or from boyfriends being like "thank you so much",' she said</p>

<p>'It's been good and really surprising in the best way. I think there's a niche market for it, particularly in Australia,' she said.</p>

<p>'So many women have insecurities or feel shame or feel scared to talk about certain topics, and me talking about it on the podcast is earth shattering for some women.</p>

<p>'There's so much shame around our entire lives, so I think that's why it's doing so well.'</p>

<p>She's hit a nerve! Abbie, who is a Libra ambassador, told Daily Mail Australia that she's been 'surprised' with the success of her podcast. 'It's been good and really surprising in the best way. I think there's a niche market for it, particularly in Australia,' she said</p>
