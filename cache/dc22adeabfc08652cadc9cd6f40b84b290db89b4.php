<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hovered at the 884,000 mark for the second straight week as layoffs continue six months after the COVID-19 pandemic first flattened the economy. </p>

<p>New claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 884,000 in the week ending September 4, according to the latest figures released by the Labor Department on Thursday.</p>

<p>The latest figures match the number of applications received in the week prior. </p>

<p>The job market is improving fitfully amid the ongoing pandemic as portions of the economy have reopened and companies are recalling some workers they had temporarily laid off. </p>

<p>New claims for state unemployment benefits totaled 884,000 in the week ending September 4, according to the latest figures released by the Labor Department on Thursday</p>

<p>Employers have so far added back about half the record 22 million jobs that were lost to the pandemic. </p>

<p>Hiring, however, has slowed since June and a rising number of laid-off workers say they regard their job loss as permanent. The recovery of those jobs will likely take longer to achieve.</p>

<p>The government also said Thursday that 13.4 million people are continuing to receive traditional jobless benefits, up from 13.3 million the previous week. The increase suggests that hiring isn't occurring quickly enough to offset still-widespread layoffs. </p>
