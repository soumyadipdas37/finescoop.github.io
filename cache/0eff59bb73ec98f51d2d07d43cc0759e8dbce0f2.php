<p>The royal reportedly suggested he missed his work for the air ambulance during a visit to an NHS call centre in March of this year </p>

<p>A source told the Sun in March that the royal was contemplating a return to service.</p>

<p>The insider said: 'William has been seriously considering returning as an air ambulance pilot to help in the current pandemic.</p>

<p>'He knows the whole country is doing its bit and he wants to help. But it's complicated as he was originally grounded from the job so that he could become a senior working royal.'</p>

<p>The insider added that Prince William was 'very keen to to do anything he can to help.'</p>
