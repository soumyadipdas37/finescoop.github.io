<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Maybe it's midlife; maybe it's the endless Zoom calls that now have to take place in my sitting room.</p>

<p>Or maybe, having spent years feeding my clothes and jewellery habit, I've run out of wardrobe space and adorning my home is the logical next step. </p>

<p>Whatever it is, I confess: once a fashion addict, I've now become an interiors junkie.</p>

<p>As I write, I'm sitting on a mango yellow floral African-inspired cushion, which matches my new African-print Stella Jean kaftan. </p>

<p>I pop out to the shops and come home with Ikat cushions.</p>

<p>And it's not just me. Lockdown has turned us into a nation of nesting homeware obsessives — with fashion designers now getting in on the act.</p>

<p>Lockdown has turned us into a nation of nesting homeware obsessives. For designers, grabbing piece of £13 billion homeware market is a no-brainer</p>

<p>Alice Temperley is launching an interiors range, Gucci's outre décor collection is selling like hotcakes (geometric G wallpaper? Yes, please) and Dolce is collaborating with Smeg, covering toasters and fridges in their signature baroque prints.</p>

<p>On the High Street, Habitat's debut collection with cool fashion brand Shrimps was such a success that a second will hit stores in autumn.</p>

<p>For fashion designers, grabbing a piece of the £13 billion a year homeware market is a no-brainer. </p>

<p>Interior designer Gabrielle Blackman, one of the stars of BBC 1's home makeover programme DIY SOS, says: 'Our homes were once private spaces. Now, with Zoom, Instagram and the lockdown, they've become public.</p>

<p>'As an interior designer, I always look at how my clients dress and try to extend that into their home. </p>

<p>A good interior design is more flattering than any Instagram filter or designer suit; the right lighting can make you look thinner, younger, more fabulous.</p>

<p>'And it's exciting to have these fashion brands involved now. Household names like Alice Temperley already have people's trust — you've got the outfit, now you can have the housestyle to match.'</p>

<p>Speaking as someone who rose at 6am to comb the local boot sale for vintage vases on my recent Suffolk holiday, I couldn't be more thrilled about this development. So, here are the pieces and collections I'll be adorning my house with next …</p>

<p>BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY</p>

<p>Temperley London, temperleylondon.com</p>

<p>The British designer is known for her bohemian, artfully dishevelled take on English style — and now you can recline on an Alice-embellished velvet throw, too. </p>

<p>The range also features cushions and tablecloths in signature prints from her archives, handmade and embroidered in India. </p>

<p>I'm drooling over a Saba leopard-print tablecloth, £120-£850.</p>

<p>Temperley London's Saba leopard-print tablecloth costs between £120 and £850</p>

<p>HAUTE INTERIORS</p>

<p>Saunders Furniture by Jonathan Saunders, saundersstudio.com</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Jonathan Saunders was one of my favourite fashion shows on the London Fashion Week schedule. </p>

<p>Part of the same generation as fellow London stars Christopher Kane and Roksanda Ilincic, Saunders is a master of colour and dazzling screen prints. </p>

<p>I used to drool over his masterful combos — aqua with peach and flashes of red, gorgeous abstract print dresses.</p>

<p>He closed his namesake label and worked for Diane von Furstenburg as chief creative officer from 2016 to 2018, and has now turned his attention to interiors full time. </p>

<p>He unveiled his first furniture collection at the art fair Frieze in February.</p>

<p>At the moment, Jonathan Saunders' new creations are on a bespoke, price-on-application basis. Check out saundersstudio.com</p>

<p>Saunders studied product design at Glasgow School of Art and fell into fashion through his love of textiles — so the new focus makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>Saunders' new creations include a tubular steel square stool with leather upholstery and table, a bench made from sycamore and stained beech using a marquetry technique, and one-off wall hangings that feature his signature screen-printing.</p>

<p>At the moment, pieces are on a bespoke, price-on-application basis but a ready-made collection and High Street collaborations are bound to follow.</p>

<p>THE ULTRA HIP PICK</p>

<p>Gucci Décor, gucci.com and matchesfashion.com</p>

<p>Designer Alessandro Michele doesn't think small, so it's no surprise he wants to fill houses with the same startling aesthetic, a blend of every era and corner of the globe, that he brings to his fashion collections.</p>

<p>The range includes everything from furniture to tableware, wallpaper and porcelain trinket boxes.</p>

<p>If I had £4,500, I'd be spending it on the floral jacquard tasselled armchair. But I'll settle for a butterfly trinket tray, £195, or a Fumus Star Eye candle, £225.</p>

<p>This Gucci star eye candle, designed by Alessandro Michele, is £225. His range includes everything from furniture to tableware, wallpaper and porcelain trinket boxes</p>

<p>ITALIAN FLOURISH</p>

<p>Dolce&amp;Gabbana for Smeg at Harrods, John Lewis and dolcegabbana.com</p>

<p>Billed as a meeting of 'Sicilian aesthetics and state-of-the-art technology', the Italian duo's collaborations with high-end domestic appliance brand Smeg started a few years back.</p>

<p>Smeg products are known for their sleek minimalist chrome looks, so seeing some of the company's signature items covered in Dolce's bold and beautiful rococo prints is a delight.</p>

<p>Dolce &amp; Gabanna have teamed up with Smeg to deliver signature kitchenware with Dolce's bold and beautiful prints. The above blender is £699.95 at John Lewis</p>

<p>The latest collection, Sicily Is My Love, features a slow juicer, a blender, toaster, citrus juicer and a kettle. </p>

<p>The food blender, £699.95 at John Lewis, will perk up morning smoothies a treat.</p>

<p>RED-CARPET GLAMOUR AT HOME</p>

<p>Matthew Williamson x Vinterior, matthew williamson.com</p>

<p>As a fashion designer, Williamson was known for his red-carpet dresses and bright colour combinations. </p>

<p>Now he's left fashion for interiors, creating jungle and leopard covered wallpapers for Osborne &amp; Little and selling candles, stationery and tableware under his own label.</p>

<p>Matthew Williamson has left fashion for interiors and is selling candles, stationery and tableware under his own label. This faceted murano glass vase is £420</p>

<p>His collaboration with vintage and antique website Vinterior is a curated edit of his favourites each month. </p>

<p>KATE'S DESIGNER DOES TABLEWEAR</p>

<p>Emilia Wickstead Home Collection, modaoperandi.com</p>

<p>One of the most successful of London's crop of fashion designers, Wick-stead is loved by A-listers and royalty (including Kate) for her ladylike elegance and couture-infused silhouettes. </p>

<p>Her first foray into interiors is a partnership with pre-order trunkshow site ModaOperandi.com and features beautiful table linens in signature Emilia prints.</p>

<p>I fell in love with a dress in this floral print from one of her previous collections but I couldn't find it in my size. </p>

<p>Now, my table can wear it instead! Light Floral Linen Tablecloth, £588, and matching four napkins, £234.</p>
