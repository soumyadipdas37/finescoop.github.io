<p>Kate, who is stepmother to Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia, wrote: 'One last trip before school starts ... the baby seems to like a holiday.'</p>

<p>The latest trip comes after Kate and Rio Ferdinand reportedly splashed out £40,000 on a pair of highly-trained dogs to protect their home.</p>

<p>The celebrity couple are said to want extra security at their mansion for their growing family.</p>

<p>Happy news: It's Kate's first child with husband Rio but she is stepmother to his children Lorenz, 13, Tate, 11, and nine-year-old Tia</p>

<p>They reportedly enlisted the help of a special protection dog company, Chaperone K9, to buy the pair of black German shepherds.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'One is already at their home, and the second will be joining shortly. </p>

<p>'The couple already have a dog - Kate's chihuahua - but Rio will enjoy walking these pair a lot more!</p>

<p>'They are incredible family dogs and will protect them like nothing else - everyone has one these days and who can blame them after everything that's happened with the other footballers. Rio is taking no chances!'</p>

<p>It comes after a number of high-profile burglaries at footballers' homes, with Dele Alli and Fabinho among those targeted recently.</p>

<p>Chaperone K9 shared a snap of the new protection dogs on their Instagram, tagging Kate and Rio in the post before they edited it.</p>

<p>They also previously posted a photo of Rio posing with one of the dogs's alongside Kate's chihuahua</p>
