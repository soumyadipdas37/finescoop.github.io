<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A tropical storm has formed in the Gulf of Mexico as it swirls towards the US, while Tropical Storm Paulette is poised to become a hurricane and strike Bermuda next week.</p>

<p>The National Hurricane Center announced that Tropical Depression 19 has transformed into Tropical Storm Sally on Saturday. </p>

<p>It will bring heavy rain, powerful wind gusts, flood watches and the potential for weather warnings. </p>

<p>'Sally' is the earliest 'S' storm to form on record, besting 2005's 'Stan' by three weeks, but is expected to intensify into a hurricane.</p>

<p>There's potential for a hurricane watch this weekend with meteorologists noting that Sally will likely upgrade before it makes landfall. </p>

<p>On Saturday, the National Hurricane Center announced that Tropical Depression 19 upgraded into Tropical Storm Sally in the Gulf of Mexico (pictured)</p>

<p>Sally will remain a tropical storm until Monday evening, when it will bring hurricane conditions to a sliver of the Florida panhandle, as well as to coastal cities along Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana.</p>

<p>Parts of Louisiana, specifically Lake Charles and the surrounding areas, are still reeling from the devastating affects of Hurricane Laura last month. </p>

<p>The 150mph monster of a storm left nearly a million residents without power, killed at least 10 people and drowned out several homes with rain water.</p>

<p>Damage sustained by Hurricane Laura will cost anywhere between $4million and $12million.    </p>

<p>Tropical Storm Sally is expected to affects parts of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana this week </p>

<p>Much of South Florida has experienced rainfall as a result and flood warnings have been issued along the Treasure Coast and Okeechobee</p>

<p>Those four southern states should expect to see as much as three inches of rainfall through Wednesday, and South Florida  </p>

<p>Although Sally is currently confined to those four states, the wind and rain effects will be felt as far as Tennessee and Arkansas.</p>

<p>By Wednesday at 8am, the NHC predicts it will settle back into a tropical storm and finally a tropical depression on Thursday.</p>

<p>Between Sunday and Tuesday, Sally will see winds speeds starting at 45mph to 80mph.</p>

<p>Satellite-derived wind data indicate that Tropical Storm #Sally has formed and is centered just off the southwest coast of Florida. Maximum sustained winds are 40 mph. https://t.co/wVCrCIjDrB pic.twitter.com/KC7Bq1Vror</p>

<p>Lower Matacumbe Key of the Florida Keys has reported up to 12 inches of rain as of Saturday morning</p>

<p>But already, Sally has caused scattered thunderstorms over South Florida that caused a Flood Watch along the Treasure Coast and the city of Okeechobee.     </p>

<p>That area, as well as many cities on Florida's west side and the Gulf Coast, are at risk of flash floods for the next three days.  </p>

<p>Meteorologists have also noted the potential for rip currents, tornadoes or waterspouts to arrive Saturday evening in the Florida Keys, the Everglades and Southwest Florida.</p>

<p>Localized flooding is a big concern this weekend as Tropical Depression 19 is coming through our area. I’ve already started feeling some of the wind gusts! https://t.co/lM0Rn8k9VF pic.twitter.com/IHLVzGcljP</p>

<p>Lower Matacumbe Key of the Florida Keys has reported up to 12 inches of rain as of Saturday morning.  </p>

<p>Wind gusts between 40 to 55mph whipped around on Saturday from Boca Raton to Miami Beach, Weather Channel reports.</p>

<p>Nearby, there is a second disturbance with the possibility to develop just below the Gulf of Mexico under Texas. </p>

<p>There is a low chance that it will gain power but the weather event will bring additional rain and wind gusts to South Texas and North Mexico. </p>

<p>The National Weather Channel noted that a second weather disturbance has the potential to develop just under Texas and near Mexico</p>

<p>Just 60 hours away and the latest HWRF forecast for Tropical Depression 19 is to intensify into a hurricane prior to landfall. Another dangerous situation is developing for the Gulf States. Folks should begin to make preparations as this is a possible event in the very near term. pic.twitter.com/J5jfxWBDOD</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Paulette is expected to bring damage to Bermuda early next week as it inches across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>Similar to Tropical Storm Sally, Paulette broke a previous hurricane season record for the earliest 'P' storm. </p>

<p>The Weather Channel reports that Paulette will keep its tropical storm strength through Sunday afternoon, but then will become either a Category one or two level hurricane.  </p>

<p>At the moment, Paulette has maximum sustained winds of 70mph and it moving at about 15mph.</p>

<p>The tropical storm was slowed down by upper-level winds coupled with dry air, but a drop in wind shear will allow it to become a hurricane by Saturday night.</p>

<p>Bermuda was issued a hurricane warning and could see up to 10 inches of rainfall </p>

<p>A hurricane warning was issued for Bermuda with concerns over heavy, severe rainfall ranging between three and six inches. The territory could see up to 10 inches of rainfall.</p>

<p>However, Paulette could transform into a serious hurricane after it leaves Bermuda and heads northeast into the Atlantic Ocean. </p>

<p>Swells created by Paulette will spread from Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Bahamas and the Lesser Antilles, Weather Channel reports.</p>

<p>Ocean waves will reach a peak in Florida this weekend, but similar occurrences will likely be found on Monday near the Carolinas.</p>

<p>The potential for rip currents will affect almost the entirety of the East Coast between Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
