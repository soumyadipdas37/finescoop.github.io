<p>Career journey: It comes after the business woman recently admitted that running her successful lingerie brand Ultimo had a severe impact on her mental health</p>

<p>At the height of her career at Ultimo, Michelle was eight stone heavier, and she told the podcast that putting work first impacted both her physical and mental health. </p>

<p>'I always used to put myself second, Ultimo came ﬁrst. Of course, my kids and my family, but I was always second,' she explained.</p>

<p>It was one of Ultimo's poster girls - model Rachel Hunter - who inspired the businesswomen to change her thinking when it came to food.</p>

<p>'I was abusing myself eating, because that was my way of dealing with stress. I put on the over eight stone and that's when Rachel Hunter said to me, "Why don't you treat your body like a business?" </p>

<p>Health overhaul: Michelle described how working with models during her Ultimo years left her feeling 'terrible' about her own looks before she lost eight stone in weight (pictured left in 2003 and right in 2020)</p>

<p>'That was just like a light switch for me thinking, "Well, I wouldn't abuse my own business, so why am I abusing one body?"' </p>

<p>Michelle went on to explain that working with Rachel and other celebs like the Spice Girls left her feeling 'terrible' about her own looks. </p>

<p>'Every time I did a photo shoot with them and directed a shoot, I then felt terrible and depressed,' she said.</p>

<p>'I looked at these women and the perfect bodies and then I got undressed at night for bed and I looked at me and I thought, "You're just disgusting."</p>

<p>Advice: It was one of Ultimo's poster girls - model Rachel Hunter - who inspired the businesswomen to change her thinking when it came to food (pictured together in 2004)</p>

<p>'Ultimo for me was bad for me mentally, but I managed to overcome it. I think that's probably what drove me to lose the weight as well and get ﬁt, because I was always getting compared, even though I was a businesswoman, but I was the same age as them.'</p>

<p>'I'm exactly the same age as Rachel Hunter, and you put her together and me together, and I was like two tonne Tess and my face was pumped up too, it was almost going to burst, but seeing that you can be happy being size 18 or size 20.</p>

<p>'I think that that's great now that people accept, that it's all about how you feel about yourself.'</p>

<p>Michelle went on to lose eight stone in weight over seven years and now credits her love of exercise with her happiness as well as her continued success in business.   </p>

<p>She is currently planning her wedding to Doug Barrowman, who she became engaged to in 2018 following her acrimonious divorce.  </p>
