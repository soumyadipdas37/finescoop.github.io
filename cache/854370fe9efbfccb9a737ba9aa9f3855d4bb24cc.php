<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andrew Flintoff revealed last night he is still suffering from bulimia, eight years after going public about the problem.</p>

<p>The former England cricket captain said that while he feels 'in control' and has a 'coping mechanism' to live with the eating disorder, he has struggled with it as recently as this year.</p>

<p>'I probably should get help – I know it's a problem and I know it needs addressing,' he admitted in a BBC documentary.</p>

<p>The former England cricket captain said that while he feels 'in control' and has a 'coping mechanism' to live with the eating disorder, he has struggled with it as recently as this year</p>

<p>The 42-year-old father of four, now a co-presenter of Top Gear, told how the problem first surfaced in the early days of his cricket career when he was pilloried for his weight.</p>

<p>In the programme Freddie Flintoff: Living With Bulimia, he spoke to other men seeking help for the problem and to the family of one who died of a heart attack brought on by it.</p>

<p>Confronting his bulimia, Flintoff said: 'I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed the results.</p>

<p>'I don't know whether it's just being a bloke, you feel you should be able to stop it.'</p>

<p>But while feeling 'in control' of the situation, he admitted: 'I probably should get help. I know it's a problem and I know it needs addressing.'</p>

<p>'I probably should get help – I know it's a problem and I know it needs addressing,' he admitted in a BBC documentary</p>

<p>Although he said he has now developed a 'coping mechanism' which means he mostly manages to avoid the urge to make himself sick after eating, he said: 'I've had periods when I've done it this year.'</p>

<p>He also confessed to hiding the true scale of the problem from his wife Rachael, 42, saying he 'lied a few times'.</p>

<p>'If I didn't do it, I didn't feel good about myself,' he said.</p>

<p>It was while filming a documentary about training to be a boxer in 2012 that Flintoff first revealed he had bulimia.</p>

<p>Last night he said he believes the reason he hasn't dealt with it is 'because everything else is going so well' now, including his TV career and 'amazing family'.</p>

<p>He added: 'I have this new career as a television presenter, which I love; I have an amazing family who support me through everything.'</p>

<p>The BBC programme quoted statistics about how an estimated 1:4 bulimia sufferers are male, but 60 per cent of them do not seek help.</p>

<p>Flintoff said that making the programme - particularly interviewing Pam Nugent, whose young son Laurence died in 2009 - had make him 'question how I deal with my eating disorder'.</p>

<p>He added: 'A 24-year-old had a heart attack through bulimia. It's that thing where you think it's never going to happen to you.</p>

<p>'I don't want to be a statistic, I don't want to be something that's read about in years to come, that something's happened to me'.</p>
