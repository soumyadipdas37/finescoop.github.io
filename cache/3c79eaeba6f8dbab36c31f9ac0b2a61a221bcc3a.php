<p>A pottery-obsessed couple have put their £250,000 collection of ceramics on sale after an 'overwhelmed' auctioneer found it crammed inside their former home</p>

<p>Leonard and Alison Shurz steadily filled every room of their three-bedroom house with Britain's largest collection of ceramic pieces that they had gathered from all over the world</p>

<p>The Aladdin's Cave of pots, bowls, plates, vases and jugs was found by a stunned auctioneer who had the daunting task of cataloguing it all. Pictured: Left, A tapered porcelain bottle by Lucie Rie with an estimate of £5,000 - £7,000. Right, A Lucie Rie fluted stoneware bottle with an estimate of £5,000 - £7,000</p>

<p>Pictured is the couple's porcelain bowl by Lucie Rie covered in a mottled pale green glaze with an estimate of £2,500-£3,500</p>

<p>The Aladdin's Cave of pots, bowls, plates, vases and jugs was found by a stunned auctioneer who had the daunting task of cataloguing it all. Pictured: A wood fired stoneware vase with an estimate of £800 - £1,200</p>

<p> Even the couple's food pantry was stuffed with ceramic pots. After turning the door knob that was fashioned out of a ceramic tile, expert Jason Wood struggled to get inside because of pots left in the hallway</p>

<p>Ms Wood had to tiptoe around expensive ceramics that had been kept on the stairs and clear a path across the living room floor to get to the sofa. Pictured: A white earthenware sculpture comprising multi-sided blocks with an estimate of £80 - £120</p>

<p>The couple spent years and year collecting pieces from almost every major international potter and often had crates of ceramics shipped over from the US. Pictured: Left, A porcelain sculpture by Ruth Duckworth with a central disc with an estimate of £120 - £180. Right: A very large faceted stoneware bottle covered in green ash glaze with an estimate of £350 - £550</p>

<p>The Shurzs collected pieces from almost every major international potter and often had crates of ceramics shipped to the UK from America.</p>

<p>They were well known for their passion and enthusiasm for pottery, with one dealer recalling how they often bounded into her gallery with padded bags they hoped to fill.</p>

<p>Mr Shurz died last year aged in his 80s and his widow is now in a care home.</p>

<p>Pictured: Leonard and Alison Shurz. They were well known for their passion and enthusiasm for pottery, with one dealer recalling how they often bounded into her gallery with padded bags they hoped to fill</p>

<p>Their two children both live in the US and are selling their parents' vast collection.</p>

<p>The sale involves 1,500 pieces that are being sold by Adam Partridge Auctioneers of Macclesfield, Cheshire, over two days.</p>

<p>The collection has been conservatively estimated at £250,000 but will probably go for more.</p>

<p>One of the most expensive pieces is a £7,000 fluted stoneware bottle made by famed British potter Lucie Rie that was found on a shelf above the Shurz's bed.</p>

<p>A second Rie piece, a chocolate-coloured porcelain bottle the couple bought directly from the artist, was found in a packed display cabinet in the dining room. It is worth £10,000.</p>

<p>Jason Wood, ceramics expert for Adam Partridge, said he was stunned when he entered the Shuz's detached home in Digswell, near Welwyn Garden City, Hertforshire.</p>

<p>He said: 'Even before entering the house the collection announced itself in the form of an Alan Wallwork tile fashioned as a door knob but nothing could prepare me for what confronted me inside.</p>

<p>'My eyes were on stalks, it was so overwhelming. It is the most ridiculous amount of stuff in one house that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>'I couldn't get through the front door at first because it banged into a very large pot that was behind it. I had to squeeze past things to get into different rooms.</p>

<p>'One of the bedrooms had been turned into the ''Pot Room'' but evidently when that filled up the Shurzs put their pieces all over the place. There was no logic to it, wherever they had a space they filled it with a ceramic.</p>

<p>'Every room was stacked to the ceiling with exceptional ceramics from around the world. It was more of an accumulation than a collection.</p>

<p>Leonard Shurz started his collection in the 1960s and displayed his pottery at his London home. He met his wife Alison in 1964</p>

<p>The sale involves 1,500 pieces that are being sold by Adam Partridge Auctioneers of Macclesfield, Cheshire, over two days. Pictured: Left, A porcelain stem bowl with an estimate £180 - £220. Right, A wood fired stoneware jar with an estimate of £120 - £180</p>

<p>The couple's house in Digswell where the serving hatch was repurposed as a display cabinet to show off even more of their ceramic collection </p>

<p>The collection has been conservatively estimated at £250,000 but will probably go for more. Jason Wood, ceramics expert for Adam Partridge, said he was stunned when he entered the Shuz's detached home in Digswell, near Welwyn Garden City, Hertforshire. Pictured: Left, A stoneware bowl by Lucie Die with an estimate of £2,500 - £3,500. Right, A porcelain bowl by Lucie Rie with an estimate of £3,000 - £5,000</p>

<p>Mr Wood said: 'My eyes were on stalks, it was so overwhelming. It is the most ridiculous amount of stuff in one house that I have ever seen'. Pictured: Left, A square porcelain basket, made circa 1975 with an estimate of £150 - £200. Right, A twisted cylindrical porcelain pot by Gillian Lowndes with an estimate of £150 - £200</p>

<p>One of the most expensive pieces is a £7,000 fluted stoneware bottle made by famed British potter Lucie Rie that was found on a shelf above the Shurz's bed</p>

<p>'They just bought and bought and bought. They were absolutely passionate about it, they bought pieces because they liked them.</p>

<p>'I had to tiptoe up the stairs to get around some pieces.</p>

<p>'The dining table was covered in pots and I had to clear a path to get to the sofa. Fifteen hundred pots in one house is an awful lot of stuff and some of the pieces were huge. It is the largest ever collection to be sold in the UK.'</p>

<p>Mr Shurz was originally from New York but moved to London in 1964 where he met his future wife.</p>

<p>He has already acquired work by Rie as well as Hans Coper and Bernard Leach but sold most of it when the couple had children.</p>

<p>A second Rie piece, a chocolate-coloured porcelain bottle the couple bought directly from the artist, was found in a packed display cabinet in the dining room. It is worth £10,000</p>

<p>Mr Wood added: 'Even before entering the house the collection announced itself in the form of an Alan Wallwork tile fashioned as a door knob but nothing could prepare me for what confronted me inside'</p>

<p>One of the bedrooms had been turned into the 'Pot Room' but when that filled up the Shurzs put their pieces all over the place. A large flat stoneware bottle with an estimate of £1,000 - £1,500</p>

It is the largest ever collection to be sold in the UK'. Pictured: Left, A stone sculpture by Andy Nasisse, 'Man', covered in dark blue glaze. Right, A stoneware vase covered in granite glaze with an estimate of £600-£800</p>

<p>But after the children fledged the nest and there was more space in their house the pair began collecting again - and didn't stop.</p>

<p>They made annual visits to America to visit their children and at the same time attended pottery conferences and fairs.</p>

<p>In the UK, they were regular faces at prestigious galleries.</p>

<p>Mike Goldmark, owner of Goldmark Gallery in Uppingham. Leicestershire, said: 'Leonard was one of Goldmark's most exceptional pot customers, buying regularly, with a fiendish eye for quality.'</p>

<p>Marta Donaghey, of Contemporary Ceramics in London, said: 'Leonard and Alison were longstanding, very loyal customers and friends of Contemporary Ceramics and the Craft Potters Association.</p>

<p>The Shurzs had a particular interest in American wood-fired pottery and amassed probably the largest collection of such works outside the US</p>

<p>'Their passion and enthusiasm for ceramics never waned and it was always a joy to see Leonard bounding through our door armed with special padded bags that he hoped and usually did fill with pots!</p>

<p>'Leonard and Alison were a team and purchases were always a joint decision after much discussion. Their taste was varied and eclectic, but they were extremely knowledgeable as well as open and curious.</p>

<p>'We very much miss the laughs and chats we shared together.'</p>

<p>Even the Shurz's kitchen and dining room was covered in pots. They were unable to use their dining table as it was intended because they covered every available surface in ceramics </p>

<p>Potter Mike Dodd, who knew the Shurzs, said: 'You couldn't help but be impressed with Leonard and Alison's infectious delight in handling and talking about pots'.
