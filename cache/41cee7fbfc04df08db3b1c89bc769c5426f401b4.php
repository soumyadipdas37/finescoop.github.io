<p>Greedy landlords and hotel owners looking to make a quick buck from the thousands without power or displaced by Hurricane Sandy were exploiting people's desperation by demanding outrageous prices for a shelter.</p>

<p>As of yesterday morning Craigslist was full of posts for costly rooms, with one ad promising people the luxury of a single bedroom apartment with electricity for a 'mere' $700 per night.</p>

<p>'Stay in comfort and style until the power comes back on,' the Post reported.</p>

<p>It wasn't just Craigslist vultures. The Red Carpet Inn in Bushwick typically charges $99 for a Friday but was asking $500 via hotels.com, according to the New York Post.The New York Palace Hotel in Midtown had also jacked its rates $100 per night to $600.</p>

<p>Marathon weekend is one of the busiest times of the year Hilton Garden Inn</p>

<p>The Plaza Hotel in Manhattan jacked its prices from $100 to $600</p>

<p>A manager at that hotel insisted to the Post that they weren't taking advantage of the hurricane's aftermath.</p>

<p>'We aren't charging them extra,' the unidentified manager said. 'It's just because of the hurricane we had high occupancy, and when we have high occupancy, the rates go up.' </p>

<p>As power was restored to lower Manhattan and the New York City Marathon was cancelled, prices quickly began to drop.</p>

<p>Hotels in midtown recently claimed to be fully booked were suddenly offering rooms at close to their regular rates.</p>

<p>As late as Friday tourists trying to book rooms in New York City via travel website were being referred to New Jersey hotels.</p>

<p>Even with the opportunity to squeeze every last penny out, there were still people trying to do the right thing.</p>

<p>One Staten Island hotel owner refused to evict storm victims so he could book marathon runners with reservations.</p>

<p>The New York City Marathon is one of the busiest weekends of the year for the Hilton Garden Inn in Bloomfield, said owner Richard Nicotra.</p>

<p>But with thousands without power and temperatures plummeting, Nicotra gave the rooms over to storm refugees.</p>

<p>Vultures: Some people advertised rooms for a ¿mere¿ $700 per night to people displaced by Hurricane Sandy</p>

<p>'These are my neighbors,' Nicotra told ABC News. 'Am I going to kick out my neighbors who lost everything, who have not a place to go, for someone who's travelling here to run a race?'</p>

<p>He even hosted a local resident's wedding at the hotel. Contracts with the NYC Road Runners Club – official sponsor of the marathon - are lifeblood of Nicotra's business but his bosses still supported him in his decision.</p>

<p>Nicotra called both the club and individual guests to explain the situation, amounting to a total of 180 guest cancellations.</p>

<p>'Well they weren't happy about it, obviously,' he said. 'But we asked them to look on the TV, look at what is going on in Staten Island.'</p>

<p>Though he couldn't offer them rooms, Nicotra promised a free cot, free meals, and a free shuttle to the starting line as an alternative.</p>

<p>'This was bigger than all of us,' Nicotra said. 'But we told them, 'Come and we will take care of you.'</p>
