<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gabrielle Union and NBC have reached a settlement following her workplace toxicity accusations after she was fired as a judge on America's Got Talent. </p>

<p>Union and NBC issued a joined statement on Tuesday saying they had settled their differences in their dispute over her firing as a judge, which she had said was retaliation for her complaints that the show tolerated racism on the set. </p>

<p>'We've reached an amicable resolution,' Union and the network said in the statement. </p>

<p>'NBC Entertainment appreciates the important concerns raised by Gabrielle Union and remains committed to ensuring an inclusive and supportive working environment where people of all backgrounds are treated with respect.'</p>

<p>Both sides declined further comment and would not give further details.</p>

<p>Sources told Deadline that Union received 'significant' compensation from the network as part of the settlement.  </p>

<p>Gabrielle Union and NBC said on Tuesday they had reached a settlement following her workplace toxicity accusations after she was fired as a judge on America's Got Talent</p>

<p>Union, known for her roles in the films Bring It On and Bad Boys II, appeared on the talent showcase created by Simon Cowell for one season last year until she and fellow first-year judge Julianne Hough weren't asked to return.</p>

<p>She said soon after that believed she was fired because she had asked NBC and the show's producers to respond to an environment that tolerated racist jokes and remarks from judges and producers, as well as a toxic workplace.</p>

<p>Union had also complained about Cowell smoking on set. </p>

<p>Union gave detailed accounts of the issues in a complaint to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing that she filed in June.</p>

<p>Union alleged she was harassed and discriminated against because of her race and experienced retaliation for reporting these problems. </p>

<p>Among the discrimination issues that Union raised was criticism of her hair from producers that she says were rooted in racism.</p>

<p>'Union, a black woman, was singled out due to her physical appearance and discriminated against by NBC due to the fact that her hair did not fit within the white image that NBC apparently sought to convey to the audience,' the complaint stated. </p>

<p>It added that a network executive and a show producer 'informed Union's manager that her hair was 'too wild' and that it needed to be 'toned down.'' </p>

<p>NBC said back in May that outside investigators brought in by the network and producers found that Union's allegations had no basis and no bearing on the decision to drop her as a judge.</p>

<p>At the time, NBC said the investigation 'found an overarching culture of diversity on the show'.</p>

<p>Union has previously said her problems began when she first joined the show and found Cowell smoking on set. Union, who has been allergic to cigarette smoke since she was a little girl, fell ill</p>

<p>The review, did however, acknowledge unspecified 'areas in which reporting processes could be improved.'   </p>

<p>Union has previously said her problems began when she first joined the show and found Cowell smoking on set. </p>

<p>Union, who has been allergic to cigarette smoke since she was a little girl, fell ill.</p>

<p>'I couldn’t escape. I ended up staying sick for two months straight. It was a cold that lingered, and turned into bronchitis, because I couldn’t shake it. It impacted my voice, which affects my ability to do my job,' Union said in an interview with Variety earlier this year.</p>

<p>Union revealed bringing up Cowell's smoke to producers was a dire choice for her.</p>

<p>'Coming onto a set and you are literally met with the very definition of a toxic work environment, and it’s being carried out by the most powerful person on the production,' she told Variety.</p>

<p>Producers told her there had been complaints about his smoking in the past but effectively, nothing would change.</p>

<p>After her complaint Cowell claims he changed his smoking habits and the issue wasn’t raised again. He said he didn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable and as soon as he learned of her concerns he smoked outdoors. </p>

<p>Weeks later guest judge Jay Leno was on the show and cracked a joke that Cowell’s pet dogs looked like food items found on a menu at a Korean restaurant, peddling the stereotype that Asian people eat dog meat.</p>

<p>'My first big interview in this industry, the first person who allowed me to come on their talk show, was Jay Leno. I’ve always held him in high regard, but I was not prepared for his joke,' Union said.</p>

<p>'I gasped. I froze. Other things had already happened, but at this point, it was so wildly racist,' she added.</p>

<p>Producers reportedly said they would edit his comment out.</p>
