<p>Denise spoke on Loose Women about her stint on ITV's skating series earlier this week, saying: 'I'm really excited. Finally, I get to tell people. I've kept this a secret from most of my friends and family. Betsy (her 10-year-old daughter) doesn't even know.</p>

<p>'She's at school, so she's going to find out this afternoon when I pick her up from school.. She will be so excited. She loves the show and we watch it every year...</p>
