<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A spate of attacks on boats in Spanish and Portuguese waters by killer whales have confused scientists and left at least one crewman injured.</p>

<p>In just the last two months, two boats have lost parts of their rudders after being attacked by killer whales.</p>

<p>The attacks also left the boats with serious damage and one crew member sustained bruising after the killer whales rammed their vessel, the Guardian reports.</p>

<p>The killer whale rammed the boat at least 15 times causing it to lose steering. It had to be towed back to port to be assessed for damages</p>

<p>In the most recent incident, Halcyon Yachts were taking a 36ft vessel to the UK from A Coruña in northern Spain when a killer whale rammed it at least 15 times.</p>

<p>The vessel lost steering and had to be towed back to port because of the attack.</p>

<p>Around the same time a radio warning was issued after killer whales were spotted near Vigo where two other recent collisions had taken place.</p>

<p>Alfredo López, a biologist from the Coordinator for the Study of Marine Mammals in Galicia, told the paper that killer whales make their way up the Spanish-Portuguese coastline every year in September.</p>

<p>It is currently not known whether the same pod of killer whales is carrying out all of these attacks but Dr Ruth Esteban, a Gibraltar orca expert, says that it is unlikely that different groups would carry out such similarly organised attacks</p>

<p>A similar collision was recorded on August 30 when a French vessel contacted the coastguard after being attacked by the killer whales.</p>

<p>This was followed on the same day by a Spanish naval yacht, Mirfak, also coming under attack.</p>

<p>Earlier in the year, on July 29, nine killer whales surrounded a delivery boat near Cape Trafalgar before ramming the boat, spinning it round and breaking the rudder.</p>

<p>Victoria Morris who crewed the boat said that the incident had felt 'orchestrated'. </p>

<p>In the same week, another boat was targeted by the animals and the attack nearly dislocated the shoulder of the helmsman. </p>

<p>A British couple, Beverly Harris and Kevin Large, were on a 40ft yacht at 11.30pm the previous day and they too were attacked. </p>

<p>It is currently not known whether the same pod of killer whales is carrying out all of these attacks but Dr Ruth Esteban, a Gibraltar orca expert, says that it is unlikely that different groups would carry out such similarly organised attacks.</p>

<p>The Spanish maritime authorities have warned boats to keep their distance from killer whales but some sailors claim that the animals chase boats passing through the area. </p>

<p>The killer whale, or orca, is the largest member of the dolphin family with a complex diet that sees different groups of the animal eating different prey.</p>

<p>Generally killer whales are not considered to be a threat to humans. </p>
