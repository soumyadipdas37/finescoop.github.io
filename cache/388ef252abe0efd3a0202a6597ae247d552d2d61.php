<p>He was nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role in Bad Education but lost out to Mark Ruffalo who played two characters in I Know This Much is True.</p>

<p>Due to the pandemic, nominees were streamed in to the show from all around the globe via professional production kits sent out by the Academy.</p>

<p>For the major awards, a crew member in a hazmat suit was sent to wherever the nominees were beaming in from with the golden Emmy statute - ready to present it if they won.</p>

<p>That meant even the losers of each category were able to glimpse the award that just slipped through their fingers. </p>

<p>Emmy's producer Phil Rosenberg was on such crew member who was dispatched to Jackman and Furness's multi million dollar Manhattan apartment. </p>

<p>'Every single one of us were sent an Emmy, none of them were engraved,' Rosenberg told E! News. 'Only Ernst &amp; Young knew who the winners were, they keep that under lock-and-key…We had to send [awards] to every person's house.'</p>

<p>Rosenberg said the team used a app similar to a Walkie-Talkie to communicate globally and only found out who'd won the category seconds before the presenter announced the name. </p>
