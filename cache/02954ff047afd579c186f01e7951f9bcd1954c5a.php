<p>At least 90 phone masts in the UK have been damaged or burnt in attacks linked to the claims during lockdown.</p>

<p>Conspiracy theorists claim that the high-speed network is behind the Covid outbreak which has led to some communication masts being vandalised.</p>

<p>The theorists have claimed that the network could damage public health by emitting dangerous levels of radiation.  </p>

<p>Experts have repeatedly dismissed links to 5G and the coronavirus as false.   </p>

<p>The government recently published a guide on 5G masts in a bid to squash the 'quack' theories that the new technology could harm people's health. </p>

<p>The information pamphlet, 5G Mobile Technology: A Guide, was issued in a bid to dispel misleading theories circulating on social media.</p>
