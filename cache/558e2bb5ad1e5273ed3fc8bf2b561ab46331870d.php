<p>Illusionist and magician David Blaine has launched his daring stunt that will see him float some 18,000 feet into the sky held up by nothing other than 52 helium-filled balloons</p>

<p>The 47-year-old's 'Ascension' stunt kicked off in Page, Arizona on Wednesday morning</p>

<p>Just prior to getting underway, Blaine said the stunt felt 'way crazier' than anything he has ever previously done. </p>

<p>'This thing feels insane. Normally I feel like I have control... this I have no control over anything,' he said. </p>

<p>His nine-year-old daughter Dessa watched on from the ground.  </p>

<p>The stunt, which was initially scheduled to be held in his hometown of New York City, had to be postponed earlier this week due to unfavorable weather and wind conditions. </p>

<p>Blaine has previously said he was inspired to duplicate the image from the 1956 French film Le Ballon Rouge where a little boy goes floating into the sky holding onto a pack of balloons. </p>

<p>Blaine is pictured above being fitted with his safety gear. He will be fitted to a parachute and oxygen mask throughout the stunt</p>

<p>'Ascension' is his first live-broadcast stunt since 2012 when he spent 72 hours standing on a pillar in New York City while being hit with one million volts of electricity. </p>

<p>Blaine said he has spent the last two years preparing for his latest stunt. </p>

<p>He says he obtained a pilot's license, a commercial balloon pilot's license and learned to skydive ahead of the stunt.  </p>

<p>He will be fitted to a parachute and oxygen mask throughout the stunt.  </p>

<p>Blaine has gained a reputation for embarking on adrenaline-pumping stunts, including being buried in a plastic box under a three-ton water-filled tank.</p>

<p>In another stunt he spent seven days submerged in an eight-foot diameter water-filled sphere in front of New York City's Lincoln Center. </p>

<p>He also spent nearly 64 hours trapped in a huge block of ice in Times Square.</p>

<p>In 2003, he carried out a stunt in London where he lasted 44 days in a suspended box over the Thames River without food.</p>
