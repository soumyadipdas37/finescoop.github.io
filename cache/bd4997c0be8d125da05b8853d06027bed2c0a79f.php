<p>Sarr, 22, has been on Liverpool's shortlist and is rated around £45m by the Championship side.</p>

<p>United have previously dismissed links with the Senegal international but he is understood to have come into their thinking with time running out in the summer transfer window. </p>

<p>Manchester United are considering Watford's Ismaila Sarr as an alternative to Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>United are running out of time in the window and have not made a breakthrough with Sancho</p>

<p> Sarr, 22, has been on Liverpool 's shortlist and is rated around £45m by the Championship side</p>

<p>Sarr has impressed at Watford since his £25m move from Rennes last year but was unable to save the club from relegation to the second tier.</p>

<p>The winger played the full 90 minutes as Watford beat Luton in their first game of the new season on Saturday.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Sunday United were considering alternatives if their latest ploy to tempt Sancho away did not come to fruition. </p>

<p>Sarr has impressed at Championship side Watford since his £25m move from Rennes last year</p>

<p>And he could be an option if United's latest ploy to tempt Dortmund into selling Sancho fails</p>

<p>Dortmund have been adamant in recent weeks that the £108million-rated England international will stay with them for the season.</p>

<p>But should they fail to tempt Dortmund into selling with their offer of around £65m plus achievable add ons up to £90m, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will revert to alternatives.</p>

<p>Napoli's Arkadiusz Milik, Bournemouth's Josh King, Ivan Perisic of Inter Milan and Douglas Costa of Juventus have all been discussed, and now it appears Sarr - who was reportedly close to a move to Liverpool earlier this month - has joined that list.</p>

<p>The pressure is on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and United to deliver before the window slams shut</p>

<p>Meanwhile, AC MIlan have asked about taking United defender Diogo Dalot on loan.</p>

<p>United would prefer an outright sale for the Portugal Under 21 international. Milan have also discussed Tottenham's Serge Aurier and Max Aarons of Norwich.</p>

<p>United midfielder Andreas Pereira is also expected to finalise his loan move to Lazio this week. </p>

<p>Talks are continuing over the deal with the option to make the transfer permanent for £25m.</p>
