<p>The couple have tied the knot in Las Vegas, a day after they were revealed to have obtained a marriage license, according to The Sun. </p>

<p>Hitched! Lily Allen and David Harbour are reportedly married </p>

<p>According to TMZ, the pop star, 35, and the Stranger Things actor, 45, have registered to marry in Sin City with a license that is valid for 12 months.</p>

<p>Public records obtained by the publication state the expiration date for the license is September 6 2021 - meaning they will need to wed within a year.</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached reps for the couple for comment. </p>

<p>This comes days after Lily was seen strolling through New York flashing a sparkling diamond ring - fueling the unconfirmed rumours she and David are engaged.</p>

<p>They were with her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven, while taking a stroll through the city.</p>

<p>To actually get married, the certificate has to come through - and this has yet to be issued.</p>

<p>Although TMZ have suggested they could tie the knot without it, and file it afterwards to make it official.</p>

<p>When seen last week, Lily lowered her protective face mask to sip an iced drink, flashing the sparkling jewellery as she did.</p>

<p>This was not the first time she had been seen wearing the ring; the Hard Out Here songstress debuted it last year, on her ring finger.</p>

<p>The couple were first spotted at the theatre in London last August and their relationship has gone on from strength-to-strength. </p>
