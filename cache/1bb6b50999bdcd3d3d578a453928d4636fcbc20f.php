<p>Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer hit back at writer James Delingpole after he criticised commuters on his train for wearing face-coverings</p>

<p>Mr Delingpole - who is opposed to mandatory wearing of masks during the pandemic - tweeted: 'Everyone on the train in a mask. Everyone.</p>

<p>'How did we win Waterloo?'</p>

<p>Former Army officer Mr Mercer, MP for Plymouth, Devon - replied: 'Without people like you.</p>

<p>'Stop being a selfish c**t, and put on a mask.'</p>

<p>Paul Stonehous replied: 'You have let your party and yourself down by resorting to this type of language.' </p>

<p>Another added: 'You don't have to use the word to be one.'</p>

<p>Standup comic Lee Hurst joked: 'Hi Johnny. I'm a selfish c**t too.'</p>

<p>But Mr Mercer was backed by Dom Joly who said: 'Bravo.'</p>

<p>Delingpole is known for his controversial views on several topics, including climate change denial and campaigning against wind farms. </p>

<p>He is currently the executive editor of alt-right news site Breitbart London, a UK-focused version of Breitbart News in the US, which has been involved in several conspiracy theories and became a rallying spot for Donald Trump supporters in 2016.</p>

<p>Describing coronavirus as an 'alleged crisis' in a recent interview, Delingpole said: ‘The British people are more scared of coronavirus than any other nation on Earth.’</p>

<p>He added that 'no sane or informed person' would wear a mask in a supermarket, and would 'totally' encourage his children to break laws relating to the pandemic because 'I don't want my children growing up to be the compliant gimps of a fascist state'.</p>

<p>Others reacting to the twitter exchange mocked Mr Delingpole for his lack of history knowledge.</p>

<p>Ian Harris said: 'My history of the battle of Waterloo is rusty, but I'm fairly sure it wasn't an airborne contagious virus.</p>

<p>'However, they did wear armour to protect themselves from artillery.'</p>

<p>Chris Parker said: 'Mostly by the Prussians turning up in the nick of time, from memory.</p>

<p>'A cavalry charge isn't going to do much against Covid-19, sadly.</p>

<p>'Just wear a mask, the sooner we stop the spread of the virus, the sooner we won't have to wear the damn things.'</p>

<p>Peter Mitchell added: 'S**t take. Disease prevention is crucial for the military.</p>

<p>'Always has been. So, the napoleonic wars you mention.</p>

<p>'Limes prevented scurvy in the Royal Navy.</p>

<p>'Gave them an edge due to more fit men. Disease prevention helped win the wars concluded at Waterloo.' </p>
