<p>Race director Michael Masi spoke out after the six-time world champion complained that officials picked on him by imposing a 10-second penalty for performing practice starts in an unauthorised area before last Sunday’s Russian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>The punishment cost the Briton a likely win, leaving him one short of Michael Schumacher’s record of 91 victories but still leading the championship by 44 points.</p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton complained about the officials after a 10-second penalty was imposed on him</p>

<p>But Sunday's race director Michael Masi insisted there were no special rules for Hamilton </p>

<p>Masi said: ‘If Lewis wants to raise something, as I have said to him before, the door is always open. </p>

<p>'I am more than happy to discuss anything. As the FIA, we are the sporting regulator to administer the regulations. We have the stewards as an independent judiciary to adjudicate those.</p>

<p>‘There was an infringement and it doesn’t matter if it was Lewis or any one of the other 19 drivers.</p>

<p>‘If a breach of the regulations occurred, the stewards will consider it on its merits.’</p>
