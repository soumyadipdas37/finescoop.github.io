<p>Group shot! Laura Anderson reunited with a couple of her co-stars on Tuesday, as she posed for a socially-distanced snap with Dr Alex George and Jack Fincham</p>

<p>The former air hostess, 31, looked stylish in ivory silk co-ords, which consisted of a cropped blouse, teamed with a flippy mini skirt, tied at the waist.</p>

<p>Laura styled her highlighted locks in loose curls, while enhancing her pretty features with a heavy glamorous coat of make-up.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former pen salesman Jack, 26, also opted for a two-piece, as he rocked a vertically striped polo shirt and blue shorts.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a number of former Love Island stars have reportedly been left outraged, after allegedly being snubbed from appearing in an upcoming reunion special.</p>

<p>The three-part special, said to be called Love Island: Where Are They Now?, was originally planned to be restricted to the top four contestants from each series, but exceptions have reportedly been made − sparking alleged feuds.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Those involved are very excited, but it has put a few noses out of joint among stars who haven’t been asked, especially those who think they are bigger names than those who have. </p>

<p>On the list: A number of former Love Island stars have allegedly been snubbed from appearing in an upcoming reunion special, which will include Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury</p>

<p>'Unfortunately things have got a bit nasty between some. At first it was just going to be the finalists from each series, but once exceptions started being made it really sparked anger and resentment.'</p>

<p>Among the former contestants expected to take part in the special are 2018 breakout stars and exes Megan Barton Hanson and Wes Nelson, and last year's runner-ups Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Montana Brown, who narrowly missed out on the finale in 2017 after she was dumped from the Mallorca villa with her then-beau Alex Beattie, is said to be included in the line-up of returning stars.</p>

<p>Star: Megan Barton Hanson has also reportedly been included in the line-up of returning stars</p>

<p>A source said: 'It’s just not possible to have everyone on in three episodes – so unfortunately the reality is some people have had to miss out. </p>

<p>'A few of them have kicked off a bit about it, but that’s just life. They can squabble among themselves all they want.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for Love Island for comment. </p>

<p>Rules: Despite initial reported rules that only the top four from each series would be featured, Montana Brown − who narrowly missed out on the 2017 final − is said to have been included</p>
