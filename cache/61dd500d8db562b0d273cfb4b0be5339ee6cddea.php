<p>This change is particularly pronounced in Sydney's outer south-west where serious searches - involving home inspections and multiple viewings of property listings - soared by 27.3 per cent in the four weeks to September 6.</p>

<p>Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March, buyer interest in this bushland area along the Old Hume Highway has surged by 73.7 per cent. </p>

<p>Picton's median house price of $617,000 is also much cheaper than Sydney's mid-point value of $986,000, CoreLogic data showed.</p>

<p>Domain senior research analyst Nicola Powell said white collar professionals who could work from home were increasingly attracted to outer suburbs that offered lifestyle and value.</p>

<p>'Lifestyle locations that offer affordability where buyers can purchase larger blocks, people are seeing these outer areas,' Dr Powell told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Working from home has become the new normal so they're starting to look further afield.'</p>

<p>Outer areas of Sydney, in particular, were becoming more enticing as the digital transformation of workplaces negated the need for a long commute to work.</p>

<p>'While a tree-change or sea-change from higher-density living has always been appealing, the commute into the city has been a strong enough deterrent for many,' Dr Powell said.  </p>

<p>'Many Sydneysiders will continue to work from home or split on a part-time basis, making the distance between our homes and work less crucial.'</p>

<p>The Gold Coast hinterland area was also popular with potential buyers, with serious searches in Mudgeeraba and Tallebudgera (house pictured) soaring by 44.3 per cent in just four weeks - significantly above nearby greater Brisbane's 1.4 per cent increase. Committed searches have soared by 172.7 per cent since the start of the coronavirus crisis six months ago</p>

<p>Canberra, the home of federal public servants, is also in on the trend with buyer interest in the western suburbs of Weston Creek soaring by 13.9 per cent - more than double the Australian Capital Territory's monthly increase of 4.9 per cent.</p>

<p>Adelaide's northern suburbs were also popular, with buyer interest soaring by 49.3 per cent in the Playford City Council area covering poorer suburbs like Elizabeth.</p>

<p>This was an even bigger increase than the South Australian capital's already impressive 31.2 per cent.</p>

<p>Melbourne was the only capital city to see a plunge in both house and apartment interest, following Stage Four lockdown bans since August 2 on open home inspections and public auctions across the city.</p>

<p>Interest in houses dived by 13.8 per cent in four weeks, with the slump even more severe than April during the first full month of the earlier lockdowns.</p>

<p>Dr Powell putting that down to potential buyers being uncomfortable with purchasing a home they hadn't seen.</p>

<p>She expected a 'pretty swift' rebound to occur, particularly in the Mornington Peninsula on the edge of Port Phillip Bay once Victoria eased coronavirus restrictions and managed to contain the virus. </p>

<p>'Once lives return to near-normal, the commute to the office will play a less crucial role in deciding the location we reside, it may be one of the reasons for a shift in demand to Mornington Peninsula,' she said.</p>

<p>'While the lockdown has forcibly introduced working from home, the concept is likely to stay for businesses able to transition permanently.'</p>

<p>Regional Victoria markets saw a surge in buyer interest despite groups of ten people or more being banned.</p>

<p>Warrnambool, on the western end of the Great Ocean Road, saw a 63.3 per cent monthly increase in serious buyer enquiries.  </p>

<p>Canberra, the home of federal public servants, is also in on the trend with buyer interest in the western suburbs of Weston Creek (pictured) soaring by 13.9 per cent - more than double the Australian Capital Territory's monthly increase of 4.9 per cent</p>
