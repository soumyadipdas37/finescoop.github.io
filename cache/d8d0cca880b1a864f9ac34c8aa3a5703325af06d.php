<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal have asked about Dijon's Iceland international goalkeeper Runar Alex Runarsson as a possible replacement for Aston Villa bound Emiliano Martinez. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old shot-stopper made 14 appearances for the Ligue 1 outfit last season but has failed to have any game time following the start of the 2020-21 campaign.</p>

<p>Runarsson, who has been linked with a move to Championship side Brentford in the past, was an unused substitute in England's 1-0 win over Iceland in the UEFA Nations League earlier this month.</p>

<p>Arsenal have asked about Dijon's Iceland international goalkeeper Runar Alex Runarsson</p>

<p>The Gunners are looking for a possible replacement for Aston Villa bound Emiliano Martinez</p>

<p>The Gunners have also considered Brentford's £10million-rated goalkeeper David Raya as Mikel Arteta looks to find back up for No 1 Bernd Leno.</p>

<p>Leno kept a clean sheet as Arsenal secured a comfortable 3-0 victory over Fulham on the opening day of the new Premier League season at the weekend.</p>

<p>Martinez, who starred in the Gunners' recent FA Cup and Community Shield triumphs, was not included in Saturday's squad as he edges closer to a switch to Villa.</p>

<p>Arsenal are on the brink of reaching a £20m agreement to see Martinez make the move to Villa Park to be their first choice shot-stopper.</p>

<p>But the Gunners are keen to waste no time in finding his replacement as they look to bring in a new face before the transfer window closes on October 5.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old shot-stopper made 14 appearances for Ligue 1 outfit Dijon last season</p>
