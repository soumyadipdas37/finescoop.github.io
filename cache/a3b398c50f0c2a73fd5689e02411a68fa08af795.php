<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tiffany Trump praised Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for being a 'trailblazer for women in the legal field' and recalled her close relationship with Justice Antonin Scalia in a tribute on Friday. </p>

<p>The Supreme Court confirmed that Ginsburg died surrounded by her family at her home in Washington D.C. following complications with metastatic pancreatic cancer. She was 87. </p>

<p>Ginsburg, who served for 27 years on the highest court of the land, had battled several bouts of cancer after first being diagnosed in 2009. </p>

<p>Social media quickly flooded with tributes and condolences for Ginsburg, including a series of tweets from President Trump's youngest daughter.</p>

<p>Tiffany, a recent graduate from Georgetown Law School, first shared photos of Ginsburg on Twitter and said she watched her speak during a 2017 lecture at the university.</p>

<p>'In 2017, I was honored to attend a lecture by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg at Georgetown Law,' Tiffany, 26, wrote.</p>

<p>'#RBG was a pioneer for women and gender equality— graduating law school when there were only 9 female students and then becoming the 2nd woman Supreme Court Justice.'</p>

<p>In a Twitter thread later Friday evening, Tiffany recalled Ginsburg's 'surprising' friendship with former Justice Antonin Scalia and noted their commitment to justice despite their warring ideologies.</p>

<p>Scalia, who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1986, was known for his conservative rulings and opinions. Ginsburg often advocated for more liberal and progressive rulings  </p>

<p>Tiffany Trump said on Twitter that she 'was honored to attend a lecture by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg' in 2017 at Georgetown Law</p>

<p>In a series of tweets, Tiffany highlighted the 'surprising' friendship between Ginsburg and former Justice Antonin Scalia </p>

<p>'Thank you, Justice Ginsburg for being a trailblazer for women in the legal field, a pioneer for women and gender equality, and for showing that patriotism hinges not on agreement, but on the unwavering commitment to persevere, to listen, to learn, and to develop together.' Tiffany wrote.</p>

<p>'Justice Ginsburg, an icon of the left, and Justice Scalia, an icon of the right, were great friends- regardless of their different ideologies. Ginsburg admired Scalia for his love of the constitution and his fierce devotion to defend it how he believed was intended.</p>

<p>'Ginsburg often disagreed with his jurisprudence, but she too sought to defend the Constitution how she believed it was intended to by the founders. Scalia once even gave Ginsburg an advance notice of his dissent so Ginsburg could make her majority opinion better...'</p>

<p>Tiffany added that Ginsburg and Scalia's difference in opinion was dwarfed by their patriotism for their fellow Americans. Scalia served on the Supreme Court for 34 yeas before he died in 2016.</p>

<p>'What both understood about each other was that, despite their vast differences of opinion, they shared a truly unique bond - that of dedicating their life to advancing this country,' wrote Tiffany.</p>

<p>'May we learn from your devout commitment to justice so that we, too, may find extraordinary (and perhaps surprising) friendships among our fellow Americans, and continue your work to build a better and more just nation.' </p>

<p>Washington Governor Jay Inslee, also a Democrat, described her as an 'American hero' and demanded that her 'dying wish' to not be replaced on the bench until after the election be respected.</p>

<p>He tweeted: 'We have lost an American hero and a giant of justice. </p>

<p>'May we honor Justice Ginsburg’s legacy by fighting for the civil rights of all Americans and respect her dying wish that she “will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”'</p>

<p>Tributes poured in from political leaders including former president George Bush, Hillary Clinton, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo </p>

<p>His words were echoed by Senator Cory Booker who urged the nation to carry on 'her legacy of fairness and equality'.</p>

<p>'Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a true giant, an American hero and a warrior for justice,' Booker tweeted.</p>

<p>'Take a moment. Breathe. And then we fight for our country the way she always did for us. Or we will lose everything,' she wrote on Twitter. </p>

<p>Ginsburg's death gives Trump the opportunity to name her successor at a critical time just six weeks before the nation heads to the polls. </p>

<p>The president has already appointed two members of the Supreme Court, Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh, in a move that pushes the court increasingly right wing.</p>

<p>The replacement of Ginsburg, a Democrat and women's rights champion, by another Republican will leave the court Democrats outnumbered, with six Republicans to their three.</p>

<p>A debate is expected to ensue over whether Trump should nominate her successor or leave the seat vacant until after the outcome of the election. </p>

<p>Senator Chuck Schumer tweeted Friday after the news broke of Ginsburg's death that the position should not be filled until the White House race was over.</p>

<p>'The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,' he tweeted.</p>

<p>'Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.'</p>

<p>Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Clinton in 1993 and has served more than 27 years. </p>

<p>She leaves behind her two children Jane Carol Ginsburg and James Steven Ginsburg, four grandchildren Paul Spera, Clara Spera, Miranda Ginsburg and Abigail Ginsburg, two step-grandchildren Harjinder Bedi and Satinder Bedi, and one great-grandchild Lucrezia Spera. </p>

<p>Her husband Martin David Ginsburg died in 2010. </p>

<p>Ginsburg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 15 1933.   </p>
