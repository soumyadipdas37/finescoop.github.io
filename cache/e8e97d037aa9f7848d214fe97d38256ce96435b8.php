<p>An Anglo-Saxon burial ground has been painstakingly uncovered in Suffolk. Due to the acidity of the soil and the poor preservation methods used upon entombment, no bones remain, just a shadow-like 'sand silhouette' (pictured)</p>

<p>Remains discovered at the site were extremely fragile but allowed archaeologists to find out the area was a burial ground for several generations of a farming community</p>

<p>A total of 17 cremations and 191 burials were found at the 1,400-year-old site which is said to be of 'national importance'</p>

<p>Andrew Peachey, of Archaeological Solutions Ltd who led the excavations, said: 'These shadows also revealed traces of the wooden coffins.</p>

<p>'Unusually, many of the graves also included fragments of pottery and decorated pots. </p>

<p>'Many of the artefacts were so fragile they had to be removed still in the earth for analysis and conservation and we also recovered pieces of textiles and leather.'</p>

<p>The site contained remains of men, women and children, as well as a smattering of burial goods. </p>

<p>Ongoing studies will endeavour to learn more about the people who were laid to rest in the plot of land in Oulston, near Lowestoft.  </p>

<p>The site contained remains of men, women and children, as well as a smattering of burial goods. These included decorated pots (pictured)</p>

<p>Pictured, a metal item which was likely buried alongside one of the dead. These finds, as well as amber strings, glass beads and wrist clasps, will go on display in amuseum soon </p>

<p>A Suffolk county council spokesman said: 'This is a nationally significant discovery and continues to show what a historic place Suffolk is.</p>

<p>'The site lies within the 7th Century Kingdom of the East Angles, made famous by the royal burial ground at nearby Sutton Hoo.' </p>

<p>Many of the finds were extremely fragile when first discovered and archaeologists were reluctant to dig deeper in the field. </p>

<p>Some artefacts had to be block lifted, a process where a large area of land is dug out and lifted whole before being transported, and undergo micro-excavation at Norfolk Museum Service. </p>

<p>The site has now been fully excavated, paving the way for further studies to unpick the details of the 200 Anglo-Saxons who were buried here. </p>

<p>Located near Woodbridge, Suffolk, Sutton Hoo is home to two burial mounds from the 6th and 7th centuries — the latter a ship burial.</p>

<p>The undisturbed burial site is believed to have been the resting place of King Rædwald of East Anglia.</p>

<p>The vessel is oft dubbed a a 'ghost ship' thanks to how only its iron rivets and impressions of timber remained.</p>

<p>Within the ship, however, archaeologists in 1939 found a ceremonial helmet, a shield, a sword, pieces of silver plate from the Byzantine Empire and metalwork fittings made of gold and gems. </p>

<p>The Sutton Hoo artefacts are now housed in the collections of the British Museum, London, while the mound site is in the care of the National Trust.</p>
