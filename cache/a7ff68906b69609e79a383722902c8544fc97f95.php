<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Andrew is set to be carefully edited out of Prince Philip's 100th birthday celebrations. </p>

<p>He is reportedly not being invited to major events for the birthday next June and the organisers of a celebratory royal photo exhibition have been told not to include pictures of him. </p>

<p>The shamed Duke of York, one of Prince Philip's four children, will also not be allowed to write an introduction to the exhibition programme, according to a source.  </p>

<p>He has been somewhat shunned by the royal family after coming under fire for his links to disgraced paedophile Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, who was arrested for her role in allegedly procuring young girls for the financier.    </p>

<p>Prince Andrew, 60, is set to be carefully edited out of Prince Philip's 100th birthday celebrations</p>

<p>The Duke, 60, is currently being called to help the FBI with their investigation of Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>

<p>His six-month standoff with the FBI deepened after Maxwell was detained for allegedly helping to lure underage girls who were then sexually abused by Epstein.</p>

<p>Her arrest in Bradford, New Hampshire, intensified calls for Andrew to be quizzed about any involvement he may have had, despite him denying wrongdoing. </p>

<p>He has also denied claims by Virginia Roberts, Epstein's sex slave, that he slept with her on several occasions. </p>

<p>He is reportedly not being invited to major events for the birthday next June and the organisers of a celebratory royal photo exhibition have been told not to include pictures of him</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'There is a warning from up high to play down Andrew. He will be included as little as possible.</p>

<p>'It's not whitewashing history because you can't leave him out entirely. But it will not make a big deal of his relationship with the Duke of Edinburgh over the years.' </p>

<p>The photography exhibition, run by the Royal Collection Trust, will display pictures of the royals throughout the years.  </p>

<p>He has been somewhat shunned by the royal family after coming under fire for his links to disgraced paedophile Jeffrey Epstein (pictured together in 2011 - three years after Epstein admitted to procuring an underage girl for prostitution)</p>

<p>Prince Philip, who married the Queen in November 1947, will celebrate his 100th birthday on June 1 next year </p>

<p>Andrew was already cut from the official photographs of the wedding of his pwn daughter, Princess Beatrice, 31, earlier this year when she tied the knot with Edo Mapelli Mozzi, 37. </p>

<p>And his 60th birthday party was cancelled in February after he stepped down from his royal duties following a 'car crash' Newsnight interview last November which followed claims from Virginia Giuffre (née Roberts) that she slept with him in 2001 after being trafficked to London at the age of 17. </p>

<p>Andrew's 60th birthday party was cancelled in February after he stepped down from his royal duties following a 'car crash' Newsnight interview last November which followed claims from Virginia Roberts (pictured together in 2001) that she slept with him in 2001 after being trafficked to London at the age of 17</p>

<p>Andrew claimed it couldn't have happened because he was at a Pizza Express in Woking on the night in question.   </p>

<p>Epstein was found dead in jail last year after being arrested by the FBI.</p>

<p>The Royal Collection Trust said: 'Plans are not yet confirmed.' </p>

<p>Next year, the Royal Family will have several milestones to celebrate, including the Queen's 95th birthday, her Platinum Jubilee marking 70 years of reign and Prince Philip's 100th birthday. </p>

<p>So far Andrew has allegedly refused to be interviewed by prosecutors in the US but denies any wrongdoing. </p>
