<p>Claims: EastEnders stars have reportedly been left unhappy and even considering quitting over extended breaks and pay losses on the soap due to the coronavirus crisis (Jake Wood pictured in 2019 quit the soap last week after 15 years playing the villain Max Branning) </p>

<p>It comes after Jake Wood quit the BBC One soap last week after 15 years playing the villain Max Branning and in August it was revealed that Ian Beale star Adam Woodyatt is taking an 'extended break'.</p>

<p>Lacey Turner is also reportedly set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square while Tiffany Butcher star Maisie Smith was announced as a contestant on Strictly earlier this month.    </p>

<p>Yet an EastEnders spokesperson told MailOnline: 'It is not unusual in soaps for cast to have breaks for storyline reasons or other projects.</p>

<p>'However these are always planned months in advance and no discussions have taken place about operating a period of extended breaks, nor are we introducing a rotation system.' </p>

<p>Walford legend: In August, it was revealed that Ian Beale star Adam Woodyatt was being 'written out' of EastEnders as he is taking an 'extended break' from the soap (pictured in 2017) </p>

<p>It comes after a source told the Mirror: 'Cast were called by ­producers over the past few weeks and told that, going forward, they would be operating a period of extended breaks for some. </p>

<p>'It could see up to a third of the cast off at any one time on a loose rotation system. Actors will not be paid when they are off and they're not happy. Some are considering quitting.</p>

<p>'Social distancing means that fewer people can be on set at one time and they have to save money during ­difficult financial times.' </p>

<p>Earlier this week, EastEnders star Jake Wood quit the soap after 15 years playing the villain Max Branning.</p>

<p>Exciting! While earlier this month it was announced that Tiffany Butcher star Maisie Smith would be one of the 12 contestants on Strictly Come Dancing </p>

<p>The actor, 48, confirmed he would be leaving Albert Square at the end of the year, but added that bosses will be leaving the door open for his return. </p>

<p>Lacey Turner is also reportedly set to take a lengthy break from EastEnders just as her character Stacey Fowler has returned to Albert Square.</p>

<p>The actress, 32, will be back on screens this week after she went on maternity leave for a year with her daughter Dusty, fourteen months. </p>

<p>According to the Daily Star, Lacey's return will be a brief one as she will be off the soap again by the end of the year, with bosses currently plotting her temporary departure. </p>

<p>He's off! Jake, 48, confirmed he would be leaving Albert Square at the end of the year, but added that bosses will be leaving the door open for his return </p>

<p>An insider said: 'Lacey will be taking a break. The top bosses agreed to give her some time off from the show.</p>

<p>'This is a great opportunity for the writers to come up with something big for Lacey to get her teeth into.'</p>

<p>The source added that Lacey will return to the soap within the year and there are no plans for her to permanently leave EastEnders.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Lacey and EastEnders for comment. </p>
