<p>Goals: Piers Morgan has embarked on a strict new diet plan in a bid to shape up after a summer of over indulging on wine and cheese</p>

<p>'So suddenly it's all the good stuff's gone and all the kale's come in and the quinoa and vegetables. A lot of vegetables. A lot of salmon.</p>

<p>'A lot less Bordeaux - I'm down to one glass a night. And, well, during the summer, a lot of cheese went down my gullet, and and it could stretch to a bottle of red. Quite comfortably ... Depending on the quality, and maybe a little more.'</p>

<p>Piers jetted off on his annual holiday to France this summer where he regularly shared pictures enjoying lavish lunches and the odd glass of wine. </p>

<p>What a spread! Piers jetted off on his annual holiday to France this summer where he regularly shared pictures enjoying lavish lunches and the odd glass of wine</p>

<p>As Ofcom complaints soared to 15,500 following the performance, which featured portrayed a policeman kneeling on the dancer's neck, Piers lauded the routine.</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter on Thursday, the former Britain's Got Talent judge wrote: 'I thought it was great. Ignore the haters, Ashley. Proud of you.' </p>

<p>Rules:  Speaking about his new diet, Piers - who is married to journalist Celia Walden (pictured together in 2018)- said: 'I'm going to see a new personal trainer, and unfortunately Celia's taken it all quite seriously'</p>

<p>Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show last Saturday night due to its political stance. </p>

<p>An Ofcom spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline on Friday afternoon that BGT has received 15,500 complaints so far. On Monday the figure stood at 1,121. </p>

<p>The representative added: 'We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'    </p>

<p>Lunch time! The 55-year-old TV presenter has revealed he's employed personal trainer Sarah Lindsay and reduced his alcohol intake to help shed the pounds</p>

<p>Piers is also preparing to release a new book called 'Wake Up: Why The World Has Gone Nuts'.</p>

<p>The Good Morning Britain star has teased details of what fans can expect from the project.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun newspaper, he explained: 'The book's about everything from gender, to race, to identity, politics, to sexism, to feminism, to masculinity: all these things, we've all got to get a collective grip.</p>

<p>Support: Piers has also thrown his support behind Ashley Banjo, amid the fallout over his group Diversity's Black Lives Matter routine on Britain's Got Talent last weekend</p>

<p>'So I'm hoping the book, when it comes out, will wake people up and at the very least, let us have a debate without everyone throwing their toys out the pram.</p>

<p>'It's got to the stage where the majority of people are now too scared to offer any opinion about anything, particularly if you're in any form of public life.</p>

<p>'We had a story on 'GMB' this week about a hair salon in Gloucestershire, where the owner wasn't allowed to apply for a 'happy' stylist because it was discriminatory to unhappy people. I mean, f*** off! What is the world coming to?'</p>

<p>Update: Britain's Got Talent Ofcom complaints have soared again to 15,500 as dance troupe Diversity's Black Lives Matter performance continues to divide viewers. Pictured: Ashley Banjo</p>
