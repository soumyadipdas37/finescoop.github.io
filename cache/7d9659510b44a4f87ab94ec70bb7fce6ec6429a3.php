<p>'There were candles lining the hallway, red rose petals scattered across the floor, flowers, red heart-shaped balloons and two glasses of champagne waiting. I was stunned.</p>

<p>'I hope everyone is keeping safe &amp; we get through this soon &amp; a big thank you to all our NHS &amp; key workers for supporting us.'</p>
