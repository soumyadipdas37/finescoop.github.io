<p>The woman, from Melbourne, used a combination of lamb and beef mince, herbs and spices, onion, garlic, salt and pepper, bread crumbs and an egg to make her own rotisserie-style donor kebabs.</p>

<p>She insisted her homemade version tasted remarkably similar to kebab shops after she served the carved meat with wraps, mixed lettuce, tomato slices and garlic dip.</p>

<p>A home cook has recreated the popular takeaway-style kebabs at home using her air fryer</p>

<p>The woman, from Melbourne, served the sliced meat with wraps, fresh salad and garlic dip</p>

<p>'For dinner tonight, tried a recipe for takeaway style rotisserie kebab in the three-in-one air fryer. There's lots of ingredients, but surprisingly easy to make. Tastes exactly like a takeaway kebab,' she wrote in a Facebook group. </p>

<p>In a large bowl, she mixed all the ingredients together until it's well combined.</p>

<p>She pointed out the recipe, which she found on social media, requires the ingredients to be blended in a food processor - but she ended up skipping the step.</p>

<p>'Didn't have a food processor at home so I was worried the mix wouldn't stay together on the rotisserie, but it turned out great,' she said.</p>

<p>She used a combination of lamb and beef mince, herbs and spices, onion, garlic, salt and pepper, bread crumbs and an egg to make her own rotisserie-style donor kebabs</p>

<p>The woman said she rolled the meat into a log shape and placed on the rotisserie to bake</p>

<p>The woman said she rolled the meat into a log shape and then wrapped it in foil before adding a second layer as this will 'hold it together better'.</p>

<p>She baked the meat on the rotisserie for 30 minutes in the first round so the ingredients are cooked through, while holding its shape in the air fryer.</p>

<p>The home cook then removed the foil from the meat, transferred it back to the air fryer and baked for a further 30 minutes or until the surface turned golden.</p>

<p>'Unwrap foil and back in to crisp up and finish cooking,' she added.</p>

<p>She carved the meat and served it with Mission roasted garlic-flavoured wraps and Yumi's garlic dip. </p>

<p>The woman pointed out the recipe did not belong to her but she was inspired to create the dish at home after finding it in the Facebook group.</p>

<p>Many were amazed by the easy-to-make dish, while others said they were keen to make it for dinner at home. </p>

<p>'Looks fantastic. I can't wait to try this,' one woman said, while another added: 'I didn't know you could make it so easy. Thank you for the recipe.'</p>

<p>INGREDIENTS</p>

<p>500g lamb mince</p>

<p>250-500g beef mince (to taste)</p>

<p>3 tsp cumin powder</p>

<p> 3 tsp ground coriander</p>

<p>2 tsp onion powder</p>

<p>3 tsp garlic (powder, jar or fresh)</p>

<p>2 tsp ground cinnamon </p>

<p>2 tsp ground paprika</p>

<p>1/2 tsp black pepper</p>

<p>2 tbsp olive oil</p>

<p>2 tbsp salt</p>

<p>3 tbsp parsley (dry or fresh)</p>

<p>1/2 cup bread crumbs</p>

<p>1 egg</p>

<p>METHOD</p>

<p>Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Place mixture into a food processor for about a minute until combined.</p>

<p>Roll meat into a log and wrap in foil. Wrap second layer of foil as it'll hold together better (make sure log isn't longer than your rotisserie stick)</p>

<p>Place the meat on the rotisserie and bake for 30 minutes in the air fryer at 180°c. </p>

<p>Unwrap the meat from the foil and let it sit for a few minutes, then bake it on the rotisserie for a further 30 minutes, or until the surface is golden.</p>

<p>Remove the meat from the air fryer and allow it to rest for a few minutes. Carve the meat thinly with a knife.</p>

<p>Serve with warm wraps or Lebanese flat bread, fresh salads and sauces.</p>
