<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>His son Reign recently cut off his long hair after years of letting it grow.</p>

<p>Now Scott Disick has revealed his five-year-old son's newest hairdo —  a short mohawk.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star also showed off his new shorter cut in a sweet father and son photo posted late Saturday night to his Instagram. </p>

<p>Time for a change: Scott Disick, 37, revealed his new shorter hair and showed off his son Reign's new Mohawk in an Instagram post from late Saturday night</p>

<p>Scott rocked a teal Hawaiian shirt and looked cool in a set of black sunglasses while keeping his shorter hair slicked back.</p>

<p>Reign was shirtless in the photo, which was taken just above the beach, and tilted his head down to show off his eye-catching 'do.</p>

<p>Scott simply captioned the photo, 'Covid cuts.'</p>

<p>Though the mohawk hairstyle is often associated with the Mohawk people of North America, it's closer to hairstyles worn by the Pawnee people of the Central Plains.</p>

<p>Some critics consider white people wearing the haircut to be a form of cultural appropriation, though it has also been documented in Europe going back hundreds of years before the Common Era.</p>

<p>New hair: Scott wrote that the two got 'Covid cuts' in his caption. For years, he and his ex Kourtney Kardashian let Reign grow his hair out</p>

<p>Saying goodbye: Scott's new makeover follows news that his longtime series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be ending in 2021 after airing its 20th season; shown in October 2019</p>

<p>Scott's new makeover follows news that his longtime series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be ending in 2021 after airing its 20th season.</p>

<p>'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians,' the Kardashian–Jenner family wrote in a statement.</p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years — through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children,' they continued.</p>

<p>'We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.' </p>

<p>Minority party: Scott began appearing on KUWTK with his ex Kourtney Kardashian in 2007. He and Khloé Kardashian wanted to keep the show going, according to Page Six; shown in 2007</p>

<p>According to Page Six, the family was 'divided' into two camps on whether or not to end the show, with only Scott and Khloé Kardashian looking to continue filming.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian, her husband Kanye West, and her younger sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner all supported bringing the series to an end after deciding the show wasn't the best 'money-making strategy' for them.  </p>

<p>The source added that the two holdouts saw KUWTK as an 'easy and reliable payday.'</p>

<p>'Some of them needed the money more than others,' they added, though both Scott and Khloé are believed to be multimillionaires.</p>

<p>Splitsville: Scott and Sofia Richie split following his brief rehab stay in May, though they were rumored to have reunited in July after spending Independence Day together; shown in April 2019</p>

<p>Scott first began appearing on the series with his then-partner Kourtney Kardashian in 2007, though they would later separate in 2015.</p>

<p>In addition to Reign, the former couple share their older son Mason, 10, and their daughter Penelope, eight. </p>

<p>The former model most recently dated Sofia Richie, 22, beginning in 2017, though they separated following his short stay at a rehab facility in May of this year.</p>

<p>The couple seemed to have reunited over the summer after spending time together on the Fourth of July, but the relationship ended shortly afterward.</p>

<p>More recently, Scott has been spending time with his ex Kourtney and their children.</p>

<p>Since his split, Scott has been spending more time with his ex Kourtney and their three children: Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, six</p>
