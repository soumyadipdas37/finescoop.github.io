<p>In a joint letter to the Prime Minister, bosses said the failure to get staff back to the office posed an ‘existential’ threat to many businesses.</p>

<p>The letter, seen by the Mail, was signed by more than 80 chief executives, including the heads of Greene King, Pizza Express, Caffe Nero and Marriott Hotels. </p>

<p>It was organised by the chief executive of UK Hospitality, which represents 700 businesses and 3million workers. </p>

<p>Their efforts were supported by the British Retail Consortium, which represents 5,000 businesses. The signatories employ close to half a million people.</p>

<p>Their letter, sent to Boris Johnson earlier this week, said: ‘Before Covid, half a million workers came to central London every day but many businesses have no immediate plans for staff to return to offices. </p>

<p>'This has existential risks for businesses in hospitality and its supply chain, as well as retail, leisure and entertainment, which combined employ around 20 per cent of Londoners.</p>

<p>Its signatories include D&amp;D chairman Des Gunewardena (right), whose firm has restaurants in Manchester, Leeds and London, and Gerry Ford (left), founder and chief executive of Caffe Nero</p>

<p>‘Action to build public trust to levels that will trigger a return of safe travel into central London has become a social and economic emergency... residents and workers need to be persuaded that public transport is safe and their workplaces are safe.’</p>

<p>The letter also warned of the devastating effects of a collapse in tourism. </p>

<p>It called for a blizzard of promotions and campaigns to promote the message that Britain is ‘open for business, safe and welcoming’. </p>

<p>Rail companies are set to offer flexible season tickets to encourage more workers to get back to offices, Boris Johnson has said.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister told MPs the Government was working with rail firms to provide tickets for those who will not be in the office five days a week.</p>

<p>Many offices will not be able to accommodate all their workers at the same time because of social distancing.</p>

<p>One idea mooted for flexible season tickets is that they could be bought to cover three days instead of a full week.</p>

<p>At Prime Minister’s Questions Tory MP Damian Green urged Mr Johnson ‘to encourage the rail industry to introduce flexible season tickets immediately’ to help office staff return.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister replied that the Government was working with firms on tickets that would ‘enable people to get back to work in a flexible way’.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Failure to step up current efforts ‘will see businesses fail and the triggering of an economic downward spiral’, the letter added.</p>

<p>Its signatories include D&amp;D chairman Des Gunewardena, whose firm has restaurants in Manchester, Leeds and London. </p>

<p>He said of the letter: ‘It’s a cry for help. It’s blindingly obvious that there is a short-term problem because people aren’t in their offices and there are no tourists. </p>

<p>'There is a hole there for the little cafes, where you get shoes mended... they are seriously affected.’</p>

<p>Gerry Ford, founder and chief executive of Caffe Nero, said: ‘We need a renewed and extended government push in the autumn and beyond to encourage people back to these urban locations. </p>

<p>'If not, there is a very serious risk to businesses’ ability to trade and protect jobs.’</p>

<p>Official data shows that 730,000 jobs have already been lost since the coronavirus crisis hit Britain in March. </p>

<p>Some forecasts suggest unemployment could rise to 3.5million by Christmas as the furlough scheme comes to an end. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister claimed earlier this week that ‘large numbers’ are returning to offices after schools began to reopen on Tuesday. </p>

<p>However, businesses in the capital expect just one in seven firms to bring the majority of staff back to the office by the end of September. </p>

<p>Bank of England official Alex Brazier warned MPs yesterday that a ‘sharp return’ was still impossible for many due to ‘dense office environments’.</p>

<p>He told the Treasury select committee: ‘I feel safe coming to work, but I can quite understand why many people might not. </p>

<p>'It’s not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and places like it, with the intensity we used to use it.</p>

<p>‘It’s actually not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly. </p>

<p>'We can’t expect to see a sudden and sharp return of lots of people to very dense office environments that we were used to. We should expect a more phased return.’</p>
