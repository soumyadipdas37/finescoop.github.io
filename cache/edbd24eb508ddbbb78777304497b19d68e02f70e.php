<p>The photos drew praise from followers who left comments like 'I love this skirt', 'you look great in all of these styles' and 'all adorable'.</p>

<p>In August, some of Australia's top Instagram stylists posted about an ultra-flattering pair of $20 jeans that cinch the waist, sculpt the legs and lift the behind - everything good denim should do.</p>

<p>The 'Soft Touch' skinny jeans from discount brand Best and Less are a clever fusion of jeans and leggings that are so comfortable, women have been wearing them as loungewear while working from home during COVID-19.</p>

<p>Available in black, khaki green and classic blue denim, the pants feature on the Instagram feeds of leading influencers including Sydney fashion blogger 'Luxe and Lemonade', who is known for creating stylish looks from affordable clothing.</p>

<p>'Still one of the best pairs of high-rise skinny leg jeans ever!' she wrote.</p>

<p>Seal of approval: Affordable fashion bloggers Luxe and Lemonade (left) and This is Genevieve (right) wear the $20 'Soft Touch' skinny jeans from Best and Less</p>

<p>Followers agreed, with one woman saying the post had prompted her to buy the jeans in every colour.</p>

<p>Canberra fashion blogger This is Genevieve called them the 'perfect jeans' while Melbourne plus-size model Suzie Stevens said the high-waisted silhouette stayed in place all day and felt supremely comfortable right up until she took them off.</p>

<p>New South Wales parenting blogger Taba Tribe said she 'cannot express how comfy [the jeans] are and how fabulously they fit'.</p>

<p>The jeans are the latest piece of bargain denim to win praise online, following a $20 pair from Kmart that have been compared to an iconic style of Levi's that retail for $191 – more than nine times the price.</p>

<p>The 'Super High-Rise Straight' trousers sit right on the waistline and hang neatly over the legs without accentuating 'problem' areas like the upper thighs.</p>

<p>Influencers have been raving about the quality and affordability on Instagram, with Sydney blogger 'Luxe and Lemonade' sparking a rush on the jeans with a recent outfit post.</p>

<p>'Did I need these $20 straight leg, super high-rise jeans from Kmart? No. Did I want them? 1,000 times yes,' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>One follower replied: 'After this post, I rushed down to Kmart to purchase - you definitely convinced me!'</p>
