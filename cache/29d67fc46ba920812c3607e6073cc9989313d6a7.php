<p>The Accommodation Association fears thousands of businesses will go under because lockdown is being relaxed too slowly. </p>

<p>Under the premier's plan, released on Sunday, lockdown will only end when there are an average of five cases per day, which is not expected until October 26.</p>

<p>Until then, a curfew will be in place from 9pm to 5am and residents can only leave home for exercise, shopping, school and work, and caregiving.</p>

<p>'This so-called road to recovery is actually a road to business closures and economic ruin,' said Accommodation Association CEO Dean Long.</p>

<p>'With apologies to AC/DC, the Victorian Government is in fact providing Victoria's accommodation providers with a highway to hell.'</p>

<p>The body represents close to 3,500 hotels with 100,000 employees around Australia, including 500 hotels in Victoria. </p>

<p>Before coronavirus, the accommodation sector was worth $17 billion to the Australian economy and $1.5 billion to the Victorian economy.</p>

<p>The group is demanding hotels be paid $1,000 per room per month to stay alive as lockdown is extended.  </p>

<p>Accommodation Association CEO Dean Long</p>

<p>Mr Long said: 'The Victorian Government has a moral responsibility to support accommodation businesses with a $1,000 per room monthly payment to help offset fixed costs such as electricity, water, insurance while they continue to enforce a close down on our sector.  </p>

<p>'We look forward to being part of a more consultative process with the Victorian Government to refine the roadmap moving forward.' </p>

<p>The road map has also come under fire from Opposition MPs show believe.</p>

<p>New South Wales has managed to remove lockdown and keep its economy going while suppressing cases to an average of less than 10 this month. </p>

<p>Tim Smith MP said; This isn't a recovery plan, this is the Andrews Labor govt's death warrant for Victoria.</p>

<p>'The curfew won't end until there are 5 cases a day...</p>

<p>'NSW has averaged nine cases a day for the last two weeks so under Dan's plan Sydney would have a 9pm curfew and hospitality would be closed.'</p>

<p>Victoria has announced nine more deaths from coronavirus, taking the state toll to 675 and the national figure to 762.</p>

<p>But there was some good news for the state, with new case numbers dropping significantly on Monday to 41.</p>

<p>It is Victoria's lowest daily case number since June 26.</p>

<p>Monday's figures come as Victorian small business rails against the government's roadmap out of lockdown restrictions, with Melbourne under stage-four measures for another fortnight.</p>

<p>A broader state-wide reopening is still months away, but Victorian deputy premier James Merlino said the government is doing all it can to have the economy moving again in a COVID-safe way.</p>

<p>Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell said owners are struggling under the weight of costs, including rent, equipment leases, loans and an accumulation of worker entitlements.</p>

<p>'What small businesses are telling us is that they are giving up,' she told Nine's Today program on Monday.</p>

<p>'For many of them, they are not going to be open until the end of November.'</p>

<p>Mr Merlino said the worst thing the government could do for business was open up and then a few weeks later reimpose restrictions because of a third wave.</p>

<p>'You've got to get the (infection) numbers down ... and once we do that then we can have a much broader reopening of our economy,' he told ABC radio.</p>

<p>Mr Merlino believes the state's voters are behind the government's suppression strategy.</p>

<p>'People are with us and they don't want to be put at risk,' he said.</p>

<p>'People understand that we need to ease restrictions safely and steadily.'</p>
