<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Following the success of Trinny London's wildly popular BBF Cream SPF 30 - which sold out in less than 24 hours on its release - Trinny has created a new addition to her bestselling line-up.</p>

<p>Cue the BFF De-Stress Tinted Serum (£39), a part skincare, part makeup hybrid that is designed to combat the effect cortisol (the stress-releasing hormone) has on your skin.</p>

<p>It's a multi-tasking wonder-worker two and a half years in the making, offering coverage and a slew of serious skincare benefits.</p>

<p>Trinny London BFF De-Stress Tinted Serum is a part skincare, part makeup hybrid designed to combat the effect cortisol (the stress-releasing hormone) has on your skin</p>

<p>'For years, I have been researching how to fight the signs of stress on my skin,' Trinny Woodall, founder and CEO explained. </p>

<p>'The effects make my face feel tired, lacking in energy and haggard. There was nothing out there really addressing the issue with the level of ingredients needed to target stress, so I set about developing a formula with enough punch to actually achieve proper results.'</p>

<p>The first-of-its-kind tinted serum from Trinny London, which launches today and is available in 12 shades, feels like a serum, looks like foundation, and is packed with skincare that works in unison to protect and perfect your skin.</p>

<p>She added: 'I wanted to create the first true skincare makeup hybrid. It's first of its kind - beyond anything else out there.'</p>

<p>'I wanted to create the first true skincare makeup hybrid. It's first of its kind - beyond anything else out there' – Trinny Woodall, founder and CEO</p>

<p>The formula, which took 20 times to perfect, contains a whopping 16.5 per cent active ingredients, including scientifically proven NP-TriOX TM Technology which combines five times the active concentration Neurophroline™. </p>

<p>It also features a triple broad-spectrum antioxidant complex 'to boost skin's antioxidant balance, neutralise cortisol and stimulate collagen production to defend and protect the skin from daily life stressors'.</p>

<p>I was among the first to try Trinny London's BFF De-Stress Tinted Serum, and it didn't disappoint. Using my fingers, I apply a single layer of the shade, Lucy, to my face, then double up around my nostrils and the sides of my face where I'm prone to redness. </p>

<p>With buildable coverage, the tinted serum is packed with hyaluronic acid to instantly plump and smooth, leaving your skin fresh, radiant and looking well-rested</p>

<p>It doesn't mask discolouration as a full-coverage foundation would, but it evens tone beautifully - more so than the OG BBF Cream SPF 30, thanks to its higher percentage of pigment - without changing the texture of my skin.</p>

<p>With a radiant finish, it feels supple, breathable and hydrating - probably due to the double dose of hyaluronic acid which instantly awakens my tired-looking skin.</p>

<p>Trinny, who strongly believes we should all be wearing an SPF of at least 30 daily, uses the Trinny London BFF De-Stress Tinted Serum in conjunction with BFF Cream, but it 'can be worn alone, or with Just A Touch to build your preferred coverage'.</p>

<p>Available in 12 shades, the tinted formula is breathable, easy to apply, non-greasy, non-streaky and provides all-day, buildable coverage</p>

<p>I'm not alone in being impressed by Trinny London BFF De-Stress Tinted Serum. Consumer studies found that 91 per cent of those surveyed agreed their skin tone looked more even, and after 21 days of use 84 per cent of people felt their natural skin looked better after using the product.</p>

<p>It's skincare-meets-makeup at its best, and we predict yet another sell-out success. </p>
