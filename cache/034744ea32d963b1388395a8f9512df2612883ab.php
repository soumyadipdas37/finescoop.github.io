<p>Naiko, a three-year-old white Swiss shepherd, was wounded when it wandered off near its house in the south-western French department of Gironde on Sunday.</p>

<p>When it returned, the dog's owner Sarah Galeazi found it covered in wounds and immediately took it to the vet.</p>

<p>Naiko, a three-year-old white Swiss shepherd who was shot more than 40 times in the head by a shotgun, has remarkably survived</p>

<p>The dog (pictured before its injuries) was wounded when it wandered off near its house in the south-western French department of Gironde on Sunday</p>

<p>Some of the pellets were embedded so deep in the dog's head that they could not be removed safely.</p>

<p>A large shotgun shell can normally hold up to 18 pellets, meaning the perpetrator likely reloaded before continuing to fire.</p>

<p>Ms Galeazi told French news site Demotivateur: 'The dog received 25 shots of buckshot in the head at close range. It took a pellet in the eye. There is very little chance he will come out of it.</p>

<p>Owner Sarah Galeazi initially counted 25 pellets but the vet, based in the commune of La Reole in Gironde, said the dog had more than 40 in its head.</p>

<p>'The dog is so nice, there is no reason to shoot it. It's inexcusable!'</p>

<p>The owner initially counted 25 pellets but the vet, based in the commune of La Reole in Gironde, said the dog had more than 40 in its head. </p>

<p>Naiko was placed under observation with Ms Galeazi fearing the worst but remarkably the dog survived.</p>

<p>Some of the pellets were embedded so deep in the dog's head that they could not be removed safely</p>

<p>It has lost the use of its left eye after two pellets were fired there. </p>

<p>The vet said: 'We couldn't remove all the pellets, some of them are too deep.'</p>

<p>Owner Sarah Galeazi said: 'It is a miracle that Naiko is still alive.'</p>

<p>She has filed a complaint this week at the gendarmerie in La Reole and has alerted animal rights organisations L214 and the Fondation Brigitte Bardot.</p>

<p>An investigation has been opened.</p>
