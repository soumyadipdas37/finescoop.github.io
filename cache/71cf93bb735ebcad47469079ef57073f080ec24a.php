<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England got their World Cup winning band back together on Friday night but could not summon up the rhythm of that tumultuous Lord's day in what was more like an Ashes battle than a one-day international against Australia.</p>

<p>Even though Jonny Bairstow, battling through a difficult start, made a hard-earned 84 in a partnership of 113 with Sam Billings, England could not quite recover from losing their first four wickets for 57 in pursuit of 295 to win this first of three 50-over games.</p>

<p>Nine members of the side who thrashed Australia by eight wickets en route to that first ever England World Cup win started this season-concluding 50-over series.</p>

<p>England slipped to defeat against Australia in the first one-day international at Old Trafford</p>

<p>Sam Billings clinched a brilliant ton but his heroics were not enough to give England the win</p>

<p>Only Ben Stokes, still on compassionate leave, and Liam Plunkett, shown the door arguably a year or so too soon, were missing from that crushing semi-final triumph, with Eoin Morgan able to call on the bulk of his big guns for the first time in over a year.</p>

<p>But an empty Emirates Old Trafford was in sharp contrast to that pulsating packed house at Edgbaston as Australia produced a commanding performance of their own with a good old-fashioned display of Test match-style cricket.</p>

<p>First a one-day international that looked to be heading England's way was transformed in Australia's favour by a veteran finisher in Glenn Maxwell who had not played a 50-over match for his country since that humbling day in Birmingham.</p>

<p>Then, when England were asked to make what would have been an Old Trafford record chase, they came up against the formidable pace attack that did so much to retain the Ashes for Australia last year in Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins.</p>

<p>Eoin Morgan had fallen for 23 as England were ground down across the evening by the tourists</p>

<p>Josh Hazelwood took the crucial catch of Jonny Bairstow, who departed after a superb 84</p>

<p>Marnus Labuschagne took the catch to dismiss Jos Buttler and plunge England into danger</p>

<p>England simply could not provide their trademark big hitting nor even find a way to win ugly, as Morgan wants them to prove they can do, as Australia claimed only their third 50-over victory in 14 games against the world champions and No1 ranked team.</p>

<p>At least there was a positive vision of an Ashes future in England's bowling through the sheer pace of Mark Wood and Jofra Archer and the attacking leg-spin of Adil Rashid.</p>

<p>If England are to have any chance of improving on their 5-0 and 4-0 defeats in Australia on their next visit next year then they must have real fast bowling and wrist-spin in their armoury and here they had both as Australia initially struggled.</p>

<p>Even though 50-overs provides a very different challenge to Test cricket there had to be Ashes encouragement for England in seeing David Warner bowled by an absolute snorter of a 90 miles per hour delivery from Archer. </p>

<p>Bairstow led the recovery from 57-4 but was broken after Hazlewood dashed in from long-off</p>

<p>Adam Zampa was unsuccessful in appeals against Bairstow as Australia edged into control</p>

<p>It was the third time Archer had dismissed Warner in his three innings so far on this white-ball tour and, together with Stuart Broad's mastery of England's bete noire in last summer's Ashes, this was another marker for battles ahead.</p>

<p>Archer has certainly looked more comfortable with a white-ball in his hand than a red one this summer and he was again impressive on his return to the one-day side, notably when he recovered from being hit for successive sixes by Maxwell.</p>

<p>The bowling star of that World Cup triumph got his man immediately after those two mighty blows when Maxwell dragged a slower ball onto his stumps and Archer added a third wicket in Pat Cummins to finish with three for 57.</p>

<p>If anything his partner in speed was even better, Wood claiming Aaron Finch with his first ball in 50-over cricket since that final at Lord's last year, timed at 92 mph, and going on to take three slightly cheaper wickets of his own. </p>

<p>Hazlewood (third right) celebrated with his team-mates after Joe Root was also dismissed</p>

<p>England's Mark Wood raised his arms in celebration after Mitchell Starc fell earlier in the day</p>

<p>But the most intriguing performance again came from Rashid, surely the best white-ball spinner in the world but still a reluctant red-ball one who will take a lot of persuading before he commits to England's Test future.</p>

<p>Here the man who proved so effective in England's 2-1 Twenty20 success was at it again, claiming the key wicket of Marnus Labuschagne and bamboozling the Australia batsmen in what was a good England bowling display.</p>

<p>But from the depths of 123 for five Australia, missing Steve Smith after he was hit on the head during training on Thursday, were rescued by the mercurial figure of Maxwell and a batsman much improved against spin in particular in Mitch Marsh.</p>

<p>Together they added 126, an Australian 50-over record for the sixth wicket against England, and propelled their side to what always appeared a formidable total on the sort of tacky Old Trafford pitch Morgan insisted he wanted on the eve of the series. </p>

<p>Australia finished strongly on 294-9 and left England chasing a difficult score in Manchester</p>

<p>It looked even more formidable when the. outstanding Hazlewood produced a stunning reflex catch off his own bowling to dismiss Jason Roy before ending Joe Root's painful stay at the crease on his own return to the England side.</p>

<p>And with Australia's own leg-spinner in Adam Zampa accounting for Morgan and Jos Buttler, with the help of another terrific catch, this time from Labuschagne, England looked down and out.</p>

<p>Bairstow gave them a glimmer of hope, not least when he hit Zampa for two sixes in an over, but once he fell to perhaps the best catch of the lot in the deep from Hazlewood there was no way back for England. </p>

<p>Billings, preferred to an extra bowler, did his chances of further opportunities no harm by going on to a brilliant career-best 118 but it was not enough as England fell 19 runs short on 275 for nine. </p>
