<p>The Scottish actor is poised to return as the veteran Jedi warrior in a new Disney+ series, which picks up after McGregor's last appearance as Kenobi in 2005 blockbuster Revenge Of The Sith. </p>

<p>With filming set to begin in February, shortly before McGregor's 50th birthday, he insists his advanced age has brought him closer to the wizened old character, originally played by Sir Alec Guinness. </p>

<p>Excited: Ewan McGregor admits he can't wait to reprise his role as Star Wars icon Obi Wan Kenobi, some 15-years after retiring his legendary lightsaber</p>

<p>He told the Radio Times: 'I’m very excited to do it again – I’m probably more excited about it this time round. I’m older, slightly wiser, maybe. </p>

<p>'The great fun part of it the first time was to try and be Alec Guinness, but younger. That was the acting challenge, as well as learning all the tricky fights.'</p>

<p>McGregor was just 27 when he accepted the role of Kenobi over a trilogy of films, starting in 1999 with prequel The Phantom Menace, continuing with 2002 smash Attack of the Clones and concluding in dramatic fashion with Sith.</p>

<p>May the force be with you: The Scottish actor is poised to return as the veteran Jedi warrior in a new Disney+ series, which picks up after 2005 blockbuster Revenge Of The Sith (pictured)</p>

<p>Uncertain future: McGregor was just 27 when he accepted the role of Kenobi over a trilogy of films, starting in 1999 with prequel The Phantom Menace and continuing with 2002 smash Attack of the Clones (pictured)</p>

<p>Tracing the origins of Darth Vadar and subsequent downfall of the ancient Jedi order, the films ended with Kenobi exiled on the desert planet of Tattooine as the last remaining Jedi scattered to all four corners of the galaxy.  </p>

<p>Looking ahead, McGregor believes he now has a stronger affinity with Sir Alec, who played Obi Wan Kenobi for the first time in 1977 at the age of 63.  </p>

<p>He said: 'Now I’m much closer in age to him – I guess he was in his 60s when he made the first Star Wars film, and I’m about to be in my 50s. Don’t tell anybody.</p>

<p>Previously: The actor insists his advanced age has brought him closer to the wizened old character, originally played by Sir Alec Guinness (pictured  in 1977 blockbuster A New Hope)</p>

<p>'So now I’ll be able to bridge that gap a bit more, and it’ll be fun to find him in that place.'    </p>

<p>McGregor's new show follows the enormous success of The Mandalorian, another Disney+ Star Wars spin-off set five years after Return Of The Jedi.  </p>

<p>But while that show readies itself for a second season, their yet to be titled Kenobi venture is understood to be a standalone, one series only project. </p>
