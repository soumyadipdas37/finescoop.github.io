<p>A mother-of-three who punched a woman in the face 15 times for making fun of her home town has had her prison sentence suspended.</p>

<p>Tamara Jane Drake was at the Empire Hotel, in Queenstown, on Tasmania's west coast, on October 8 last year when she heard a visitor making fun of the town while on the phone. </p>

<p>The 34-year-old approached the visitor and the pair had a conversation before the mother pushed her off of her chair, The Burnie News reported.  </p>

<p>Drake beat the other woman in the face - delivering 15 blows - and broke her nose, the Supreme Court in Burnie heard.</p>

<p>Other pub-goers had to restrain Drake. </p>

<p>The victim's eye was cut and she needed facial reconstruction surgery. </p>

<p>Justice Robert Pearce said the attack was alcohol-fuelled.</p>

<p>He said Drake had not expressed remorse for her cruel actions - which she tried to claim were in self-defence.</p>

<p>Justice Pearce said even though Drake pleaded guilty, she doesn't appear to understand the seriousness of her actions. </p>

<p>The victim has no memory of the assault - and feels the impact of the attack every day. </p>

<p>'She was embarrassed of her appearance and was off work for three months,' Justice Pearce said.</p>

<p>Drake pushed the woman off of her chair at the Empire Hotel (pictured) and savagely beat her</p>

<p>'She has some residual facial scarring and changed facial appearance and has trouble sleeping.'</p>

<p>Drake was sentenced to seven months in prison, but that has been suspended on the condition she does not commit any other offences.</p>

<p>The sentence was suspended for two years as she is the sole carer of her children, who are all under 12. </p>

<p>She will also be on probation for 18 months. </p>
