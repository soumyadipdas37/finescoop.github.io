<p>From the first moment she stepped through the door, in a fur coat and uttering the immortal words: ‘Yeah, Jackie’ she became a fan favourite.</p>

<p>She demanded a tipple with every meal, having apparently never eaten a meal without a fine wine and confessed she had never seen the show before prompting plenty of confusing Diary Room moments.</p>
