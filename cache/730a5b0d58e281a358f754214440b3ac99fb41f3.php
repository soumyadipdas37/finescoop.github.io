<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Apart from the World Cup last summer, I haven’t won much in my career and this year’s Indian Premier League represents an opportunity to claim some more silverware.</p>

<p>I have got to Twenty20 finals with both Sussex and Hobart Hurricanes in recent times, so I am hoping to make it third time lucky with Rajasthan Royals.</p>

<p>We went to the knockout stages two years ago but then Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes had to leave for England duties, and although we tried in their absence we just couldn’t get over the line.</p>

<p>This year's Indian Premier League represents a precious opportunity for some silverware</p>

<p>Hopefully we go at least one step further this year and that would make me happy. I am certainly backing us to go all the way but with any team it’s about progression.</p>

<p>In terms of standard, the IPL is similar to playing for England as all the players involved have either played international cricket, play international cricket or aren’t far off. It’s a very competitive tournament.</p>

<p>I have played in other places throughout the world and you have to be versatile playing in different conditions. You can’t just do the same things that you would do in England.</p>

<p>Playing in the UAE and not India might suit Rajasthan because some teams are really good at their own grounds and I think, with the entire tournament being played on neutral territory, there is no team with an advantage. It could make for some really good cricket.</p>

<p>We start against Chennai Super Kings on Tuesday. Given their historical successes, I guess they will be the team to beat again this year.</p>

<p>Aside from the Ashes, I haven’t played much against Steve Smith — I didn’t bowl against him in the recent T20s between England and Australia and he missed the one-dayers with concussion — so I look forward to lining up alongside him here.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to lining up alongside Steve Smith with the Royals in the coming weeks</p>

<p>That’s the thing about the IPL. It provides you with experience of playing with different people and against some that are usually on your side. For example, it’s fun to come up against my England team-mates.</p>

<p>I sat next to Moeen Ali on the flight over here. We get on really well and I told him that, if he bats against me when we play Royal Challengers Bangalore, I will be coming for him!</p>

<p>And I am sure he will try to take me down too. That’s the thing about the way we both play. </p>

<p>Sitting next to England team-mate Moeen Ali on the flight, I told him I will be coming for him!</p>

<p>Looking back with hindsight, the no-ball I bowled in the final ODI against Australia in Manchester last week was probably the game-changer — although I am pretty sure there were other small moments that impacted on the result too.</p>

<p>It wasn’t great to over-step for the first time in ODIs and I couldn’t even be upset with the umpire for calling it. It wasn’t like I had crept over, either.</p>

<p>My foot was always half-and-half throughout the whole game — I was landing with plenty of my boot behind the line — except for that one ball when Alex Carey holed out to third man and we thought we had reduced Australia to 87 for six.</p>

<p>Of course, I wish it hadn’t happened, but it did, and I can’t change that. I have always believed everything happens for a reason, even if we don’t always know what that reason is.</p>

<p>What I do know is that we are a good team and that 2-1 series defeat doesn’t define us. The best thing about this England team is that, win or lose, the mood within the group doesn’t change.</p>

<p>That allows us to perform without fear and it felt special to be a part of the win in the second game when Australia were 144 for two, chasing 232 for victory.</p>

<p>My no-ball in the final ODI against Australia in Manchester was probably the game-changer </p>

<p>Equally, in the last game when we got to 300 after losing two wickets from the first two balls.</p>

<p>Usually if we get a big score like that, Jason Roy and Joe Root will have been big contributors, so that was a pleasing aspect.</p>

<p>Games like that, though, are a reminder that other teams are also allowed to play well. Two guys scored hundreds — Carey and Glenn Maxwell — and it was always going to be hard to contain them once they were ‘in’.</p>

<p>But we have a habit of carrying every single game we lose to the last over and I am very proud of the guys and being part of this team. The best teams are never beaten until it’s over. </p>

<p>One of my friends sent me a screenshot of the ODI bowling rankings to show me I am now joint-10th with Mitchell Starc.</p>

<p>I guess for me, the only way is up from here. I have ambition to get to the very top, although I know that is not going to be an overnight thing. It could take a couple of years but I am ready for the journey.</p>

<p>So far, the ODI format is the one I have had most success in for England and there are reasons for that.</p>

<p>It’s the format I first played when I moved into international cricket and it’s the format in which I have played the most games for England, so if I keep going well I feel I will climb that ladder a lot quicker than I would in T20 or even Test cricket.</p>

<p>The ODI format is the one I have had most success in for England and there are reasons for that</p>

<p>Some people have suggested that playing against Australia brings the best out of me but I wouldn’t say I thrive particularly against them.</p>

<p>To me, one of the things about cricket is that every game is unpredictable. It just happens that some of the games when I have done well have been against them.</p>

<p>But I also did well against other teams in the 50-over World Cup, so I don’t see it as anything more than coincidence that some of my best statistical returns have come in matches with Australia.</p>

<p>For now, I have a new challenge with a new team, and it’s been good waking up to the sound of birdsong rather than that of covers being removed from a cricket ground.</p>

<p>Just like the bio-secure environment that was created for the international summer just gone, there are no chances taken out here, hence we were asked to wear the hazmat suits on arrival in the UAE and were tested for Covid-19 the following morning.</p>

<p>I have become accustomed to spending my time in this way but that doesn’t make it any less challenging.</p>

<p>I feel you have got to be in the best possible frame of mind coming into something like this because it will eat at you if you are not. It’s about being positive every day.</p>

<p>My first full day here was my 90th of living like this and I am staring down the barrel of another 60, potentially.</p>

<p>Steve Smith (from left), myself, Tom Curran and Andrew Tye wore hazmat suits on arrival</p>

<p>But I am glad I have come from England to Dubai because I can go to the beach that’s part of the hotel complex here. It’s a pleasant change of scenery.</p>

<p>What we can’t lose sight of, however, is that just to get cricket back on TV is a great achievement — and a reward for going through the hard yards of three months of quarantine.</p>

<p>I was pleased to get to the back end of this summer with a smile still on my face.</p>
