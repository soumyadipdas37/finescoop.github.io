<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A reformed gangster who once stabbed a man for bumping into him has penned an adrenaline-fuelled Booker prize long-listed novel about his violent life on the streets in north-west London.</p>

<p>Gabriel Krauze, 34, grew up in South Kilburn and went off the rails at 13, witnessing his first stabbing a year later and walking out on his family altogether at 17.</p>

<p>Despite getting in with what would widely be considered 'the wrong crowd', Krauze speaks Italian, has a grade 8 piano and won a place at a Russell Group university studying English.</p>

<p>His book, Who They Was, is an autobiographical fiction which delves into Krauze's tense double life as a gang member who stole phones at knife-point, and a keen degree student who never missed a lecture and was top of his class.</p>

<p>Gabriel Krauze, 34, who grew up in South Kilburn in north-west London, has penned an adrenaline-fuelled Booker prize long-listed novel about his violent life on the streets</p>

<p>Speaking to The Times, Krauze insisted he's a 'different person now', adding: 'I know it's reprehensible to break someone's arm or choke them out cos you want their watch. It's terrible. But I will show how people get sucked into that life. Because it's not just me. Who They Was is the story of cities everywhere.'</p>

<p>The book is not for the faint-hearted; from the opening chapter, Krauze details the appalling crimes he's committed, including violently mugging a woman on her doorstep to yank a Cartier watch from her wrist. </p>

<p>But the brutal violence jars with Krauze's aspirations to be a good student, with him cutting short his criminal activities to get an early night for his morning class at Queen Mary University of London.</p>

<p>In one scene he describes the idea of revenge being the purest form of love in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet as 'like when Romeo went to murk [beat up] Tybalt cos Tybalt murked his boy Mercutio'.</p>

<p>Despite getting in with what would widely be considered 'the wrong crowd', Krauze speaks Italian, has a grade 8 piano and won a place at a Russell Group university studying English.

<p>In another, following a night of crime, Krauze observes during a seminar on Nietzsche: 'Morality is just a rule of behaviour relative to the level of danger in which individuals live. </p>

<p>'If you're living in dangerous times, you can't afford to live according to moral structures the way someone who lives in safety and peace can.' </p>

<p>And after a gunfight, he claims: 'It's mad how you can live in a city and never see any of this. Or you just see faint smudges of it every now and again around the edges of your existence.' </p>

<p>Krauze 'loved' university, telling the publication: 'I never ever wanted to be late or skip a lecture. I'd see these students bunking off and think, "Why do you even want to be here?" but then I'd be going home and doing... bad things.' </p>

<p>Krauze grew up in South Kilburn (pictured) and went off the rails at 13, witnessing his first stabbing a year later and walking out on his family altogether at 17</p>

<p>Krauze's parents are both Polish artists who fled the country's communist regime in 1979, settling in Paddington, west London.  </p>

<p>His two brothers followed wildly different paths to Krauze, with Daniel becoming a professional violinist and Kola an actor, now based in Sweden.  </p>

<p>Before his wayward ways took hold, Krauze achieved a grade 8 in piano by the age of 12 and learned Italian during the summer holidays. He also has a working knowledge of Japanese.</p>

<p>But as he entered his teens, Krauze started hanging out on the streets, having sex and smoking marijuana. </p>

<p>He admits he was 'shook' the first time he witnessed someone get stabbed, but claimed your heart 'hardens' to it over time.</p>

<p>At 17 he moved into his friends Taz and Reuben's flat where they lived with their father Uncle T - and admitted it broke his parents' heart.</p>

<p>'I was just different,' he told The Times. 'My brother Daniel knew aged six he wanted to be a violinist and I never had that disciplined internal life. </p>

<p>'My instincts were opposite — like, he wasn't bothered by material things, respect and status. I was. </p>

<p>'I wanted a mobile phone and I saw by holding a knife to someone's throat you could get it.'</p>

<p>While his gun-carrying life is behind him, Krauze, known as Snoopz on the streets, still shows off his £3,000 dentures fashioned from white gold and diamonds, which he refers to as his 'iced-up grillz'.  </p>

<p>When people read his book, his hope is they will appreciate his writing skills and look on it as literature like they would Steinbeck or Hemingway.</p>
