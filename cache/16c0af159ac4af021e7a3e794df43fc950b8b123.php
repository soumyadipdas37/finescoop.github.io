<p>The pre-planned operation, which took place on September 3, was orchestrated by officers from Lincolnshire Police, the Spanish Civil Guard, the Environment Agency and Dyno-Rod. </p>

<p>In total 12 shipping containers were used to make up the bunkers and house a large number of cannabis plants.</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Rick Hatton, of Lincolnshire Police said: 'We are extremely grateful to our counterparts in Spain and our partners for assisting with the exploration of this site.</p>

<p>'With the operation being underground we have needed some real specialist support to uncover this activity.</p>

<p>'Only with the skills of those who joined us from Lincolnshire Fire and Rescue, the Environment Agency, East Lindsey District Council, RSPCA, Dyno-Rod and the Home Office's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory have we been able to get to this point.'</p>

<p>Environment Agency Area Director Norman Robinson said: 'Waste crime is serious - it blights communities and risks real harm to people's health and the environment, and we won't hesitate to take action against those responsible.</p>

<p>'We've now been able to put a stop to illegal activity on this site - a testament to the determination, joint-working and intelligence-sharing between multiple organisations.'</p>
