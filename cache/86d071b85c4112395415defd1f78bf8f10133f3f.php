<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An expectant stylist with an eye for a bargain has turned a discount nightie from Kmart into a chic day dress - and you can do the same for less than $10.</p>

<p>Five months pregnant and largely housebound by Melbourne's second-wave coronavirus restrictions, Shazleen Ali was browsing online shops for comfortable clothes to build trendy outfits around.</p>

<p>Scrolling through Kmart's sleepwear section, the 33-year-old from Melton, 35 kilometres west of the CBD, spotted the $18 'Lounge Nightie', a knee-length dress made from ribbed polyester which comes in two colours: beige and red. </p>

<p>Using affordable accessories and her flair for fashion, the mum-to-be transformed the beige version into a stylish midi which people claim is 'too pretty to be a nightdress'.</p>

<p>Best of all, the nightie is now reduced to $9 and it's still available online in sizes six through 24.</p>

<p>'Who wouldn't want to wear pyjamas all day,' Ms Ali told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>She said she's been 'really impressed' with Kmart's recent clothing collections and feels the retailer has drastically improved its offering in the casual wear department.</p>

<p>It was pieces from this section that she used to style the nightie, slipping a $30 denim jacket over her shoulders and $17 tennis shoes - which she calls 'super comfy' - on her feet.</p>

<p>For the finishing touch, Ms Ali accessorised with a $12 fedora hat and $2 earrings and braided her long raven hair into two plaits.</p>

<p>The result is a fashionable ensemble that looks considerably more expensive than its total price tag of just $70.</p>
