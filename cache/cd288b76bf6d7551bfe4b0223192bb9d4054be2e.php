<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian beauty expert has shared her foolproof trick for preventing makeup creasing into your smile lines - with a small dab of eye cream each day. </p>

<p>Founder of lifestyle podcast The Roject, Roj Torabi, first started noticing the way her foundation caked into her smile lines two years ago, she told Adore Beauty. </p>

<p>While she is aware the problem is grappled by millions of makeup-wearing women, she decided to investigate if there was a way to make those lines less prominent - and therefore the creasing less obvious.</p>

<p>One of the more expensive routes is cosmetic injections but she found a far more sustainable route.   </p>

<p>'Sometimes foundation settling into fine lines has to do with the quality of your foundation, but more often than not, it's about your skin barrier and structure,' she told the publication.</p>

<p>'In my research I learnt eye skincare products are designed to plump up lines and seal in moisture around the eye area. What's interesting is that my smile lines were in need of the same thing.' </p>

<p>Her favourite options include $135 Aspect Eyelift 3 (left), $160 Cosmedix Opti Crystal Liquid Crystal Eye Serum and $135 Murad Resurgence Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum (right)</p>

<p>With this in mind Roj spent a year trialling a number of eye creams on her smile lines, only to find they were successfully 'plumping' the skin around her mouth. </p>

<p>'Eye products are formulated to help prevent and combat the signs of ageing, or help you age gracefully if that's what you prefer. The skin under and around our eyes is also some of the hardest on the face to treat because it's the thinnest skin on our bodies,' she said.</p>

<p>'It's for this reason eye creams and eye serums are formulated with the most nutrient-rich ingredients to assist in elastin and collagen production to combat wrinkles.'</p>

<p>She suggests applying a tiny amount of eye product, or even just excess of your eye product that's on your finger, and smearing it on your area of concern in an upwards direction. </p>

<p>Her favourite options include $135 Aspect Eyelift 3, $160 Cosmedix Opti Crystal Liquid Crystal Eye Serum and $135 Murad Resurgence Retinol Youth Renewal Eye Serum.</p>

<p>For a more budget-friendly option there is also $49 Skinstitut Ultra Firming Eye &amp; Neck Cream, which is a high intensity corrector used to nourish and hydrate your most delicate skin areas.</p>
