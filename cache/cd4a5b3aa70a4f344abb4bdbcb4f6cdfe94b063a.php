<p>And Demi Rose was at it once again on Monday sharing pictures of her incredible curves while on holiday in Ibiza. </p>

<p>Stunning: Demi Rose showed off her incredible curves in a black thong swimsuit on holiday in Ibiza on Instagram on Monday as she lamented being stung by a jellyfish</p>

<p>She wore a pair of cats eye sunglasses as she pouted up a storm for the camera, while enjoying the sunshine. </p>

<p>Demi captioned the images with the words: 'todo perfecto' which means 'everything is perfect' in Spanish. </p>

<p>While things might seem perfect, her Twitter account was telling a different tale and Demi lamented that she has been marked after being stung by a jellyfish.</p>

<p>The thong song: Demi captioned the images with the words: 'todo perfecto' which means 'everything is perfect' in Spanish</p>

<p>She penned that she was disappointed that she couldn't enjoy a peaceful swim without jellyfish surrounding her. </p>

<p>'It was my first time getting stung a week ago and I'm just like ffs these marks need to go.'  </p>

<p>'Basically I don’t like Jellyfish' she wrote. </p>

<p>Demi added: 'It’s Jelly season over here in ibiza and it’s just impossible to swim without getting stung'.</p>

<p>Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling. </p>

<p>Not happy: Demi had some things to say about the jellyfish that stung her </p>

<p>Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.</p>

<p>Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.</p>

<p>Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.</p>

<p>Woah mama! Demi was one again keen to put her best assets on display as she posed up a storm for a sizzling snap on Sunday</p>
