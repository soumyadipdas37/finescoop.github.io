<p>Heart: A couple of days ago, Ireland posted a selfie to her Instagram in which she showed off a small black heart-shape tattoo inked high on her cheekbone close to her right eye</p>

<p>Mum isn't happy: The snap prompted a swift response from her mother, Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger. Fortunately, it turned out the small tattoo was only temporary</p>

<p>She shared: 'I would eat a meal or more like a bite and have to run to the nearest bathroom or find digestive pills or run until I couldn’t feel my legs right before bed.</p>

<p>'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  </p>

<p>Ireland shared her journey in the hope of encouraging others not to suffer in silence and to seek help. </p>

<p>'Trust me, all of that pain and destruction I inflicted on myself wasn’t worth it. Turning down so. Many. Sides. Of. Fries. Wasn’t worth it!!' Ireland said. </p>

<p>'Love yourself!! You are beautiful!! Enjoy your food. Eat ice cream with your friends! Workout and eat healthy to take care of your mind and body but find your healthy balance! Life is too short.' </p>

<p>Big milestone: Last month, she had celebrated being free from eating disorders anorexia and bulimia for six years. She had first spoken about her struggles with food back in 2018</p>
