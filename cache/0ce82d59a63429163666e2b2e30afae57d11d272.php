<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A radical pro-life activist claimed that abortion is like the holocaust because babies are being 'killed without trial' just like the Jews were by the Nazis in a fiery debate with Stacey Dooley.</p>

<p>In the clash on the broadcaster's Stacey Revisits podcast, Jeff White, from California, who runs a direct action group called Survivors Of the Abortion Holocaust, said the 'Holocaust is happening again'.</p>

<p>White claimed that it was legitimate to compare abortion to the Holocaust – in which six million Jewish people were murdered by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany – because 'people are being killed without a trial, in the case of the children in the womb while they're still innocent.'</p>

<p>He also claimed that the Holocaust is 'happening again' and that whilst what happened to Jewish people was 'terrible at every level', they 'don't own the term. Nor should they.'</p>

<p>Defending her pro-choice position, Stacey hit back by saying it was not for him to 'tell the Jewish community how to feel towards that word' and that the comparison was not a fair one. </p>

<p>Radical pro-life activist Jeff White claimed in a fiery debate with Stacey Dooley on her Revisits podcast that abortion is like the holocaust because babies are being 'killed without trial' just like the Jews were by the Nazis.

<p>White previously featured on Stacey's show, Brainwashing Stacey Dooley: Anti-Abortion Camp in 2017, in which the presenter visited 'summer camps' for children run by White.</p>

<p>On his website, White describes his group as a 'national pro-life youth ministry calling on young people to take a stand against the evil of their day, which has killed one-third of their generation.'</p>

<p>He previously revealed to the BBC that he has been arrested more than 100 times during public anti-abortion demonstrations.</p>

<p>The pair's conversation began with White admitting that his goal is to completely eliminate abortion.</p>

<p>He said he uses the term 'survivors' to describe anyone born after 1973 – the year in which abortion was legalized across the US by a decision in the landmark 'Roe v Wade' Supreme Court case. </p>

<p>In his clash with Dooley, White claimed that it was legitimate to compare abortion to the Holocaust – in which six million Jewish people were murdered by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany – because 'people are being killed without a trial, in the case of the children in the womb while they're still innocent.'

<p>He said: 'We have entire museums out here in California with the slogan that says never again. And they're talking about how we have to make sure that this terrible atrocity never happens again.</p>

<p>'The truth of the matter is, it is happening again. Not only with abortion in America but in all kinds of places where genocide is taking place.</p>

<p>'What happened to the Jewish community is terrible at every level but they don't own the term. Nor should they.</p>

<p>'In fact, if there is a legitimate comparison, if people are being killed without a trial, in the case of the children in the womb while they're still innocent.</p>

<p>'So not only should it not be offensive, they should be embracing it and they should look at the comparison and ask: is somebody dying unjustly?</p>

<p>'If we don't do that we will never stop it from happening again because there will never be another man named Hitler.</p>

<p>'It is going to look different in a different day and a different day and we need to be prepared as good people to always stand against evil.'</p>

<p>Stacey then forcefully responded by saying, 'I don't think it is for us to tell the Jewish community how to feel towards that word. This thought process is where we really differed.</p>

<p>'It is my belief and other people's belief that a cluster of cells… it is not a fair comparison.</p>

<p>White then added, 'To use the terminology a clump of cells is not really accurate.</p>

<p>'You've seen the pictures, you've seen the babies, what they look like, so to say a clump of cells isn't really accurate.'</p>

<p>White, who also told Stacey he houses 18 mothers and their children and pays for their college educations, then parodied what he believed to be Stacey's position.</p>

<p>Speaking as her, he said, 'Women, Jeff, are more important than that little baby.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter that there's two human lives, we are dismissing one of those human lives arbitrarily so that we can protect their health.'</p>

<p>He then added, 'Not even protect, you're not saving a woman's life, you're just helping her to have a better life. And the cost of helping that woman to have a better life is to kill a child.</p>

<p>'In the scales of humanity it does not weigh up.</p>

<p>'With God as your witness, what are you doing to help the oppressed, the hurting, the homeless, whoever it is in your community?</p>

<p>'For the vast majority of them that would hold that opinion, I'll tell you how much they're doing: absolutely nothing.'</p>

<p>Stacey then brought up how Jeff's organisation trains children in front-line activism against abortion.</p>

<p>She said: 'This is what I found difficult to digest. Children are so impressionable. They're so easy to manipulate.</p>

<p>'And you can sit them down, some of these kids are 11-years-old, you can feed them this narrative that you believe to be true, and then you send them out and you urge them to convince grown women not to go through with an abortion.'</p>

<p>Defending her pro-choice position, Stacey hit back by saying it was not for him to 'tell the Jewish community how to feel towards that word' and that the comparison was not a fair one. Pictured: Stacey during a similar conversation on the documentary three years ago</p>

<p>Speaking of a moment on the programme where protests were taking place outside a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic, Stacey added, 'I remember when we were all stood outside Planned Parenthood, thinking how has this child got the audacity to tell me what to do?</p>

<p>'I'm a grown woman, it is my body, it is my choice. How is this child going to help me? How is this 11-year-old going to help me?'</p>

<p>But Jeff responded by saying that if it is ok for children themselves to get an abortion, then it should be ok for 'their peers to be educated and speak to that person to convince them not to get an abortion.'</p>

<p>The campaigner, who is a Christian, then shocked Stacey by launching a volley of criticism at other believers.</p>

<p>He said: 'Christians are standing by day by day while Christians are slaughtered. But they want to talk nice on their radio shows. I want no part of it.</p>

<p>'I don't want to do Christian radio because I really have no time for them. They know better.</p>

<p>Asked if he was 'disappointed' with his fellow Christians, he added, 'I'm not disappointed, I'm disgusted. For Christians, we are called upon to love our neighbour as ourselves.</p>

<p>On his website, White describes his group as a 'national pro-life youth ministry calling on young people to take a stand against the evil of their day, which has killed one-third of their generation'. Pictured: White during his clash with Stacey on her show</p>

<p>'We are called upon to defend the poor and the weak, the defenceless. Who is more defenceless than the unborn child?</p>

<p>'The church is missing in action. And just like anyone else that goes AWOL, you should line them all up and shoot them because they're not doing the work that they're supposed to do.</p>

<p>'Is that a little rough? I'm sorry.'</p>

<p>Giving the impression that he may not have been serious, Stacey told her listeners, 'That's way too rough, he doesn't mean that. I see that your language is as loaded as ever.'</p>

<p>And despite the pair's disagreements, they both ended up praised each other.</p>

<p>Stacey said, 'If I felt like abortion was murder, I would be out there with them. </p>

<p>'And I found it really impressive actually that young people were standing up for what they thought was right.</p>

<p>White then dished out his own praise for the presenter and her show. </p>

<p>He said: 'What came through was your honesty as you weighed their position and didn’t change yours but I think you were fair. </p>

<p>'That is part of even conversation with anybody who disagrees with you.'</p>
