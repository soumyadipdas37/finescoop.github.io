<p>Tony Higgins, 57, sent out a distress call to police about 5am on Tuesday when he was moored near Granite Island off Victor Harbor, south of Adelaide </p>

<p>Debris was found washed up near the Murray Mouth on Wednesday morning consistent with items from Mr Higgin's boat</p>

<p>The items include his glasses, keys and an ID card belonging to the missing boatie, The Advertiser reported.</p>

<p>Rescue crews also found parts of Mr Higgins' boat including some of the floor, jerry cans and other equipment.</p>

<p>The 57-year-old's friend and former deckhand said the fisherman left for the Murray Mouth early on Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>'It saddens me, his boat has gone down … I can only hope he's got a life jacket on and he's made it to land,' he said. </p>

<p>Police are still investigating the disappearance. </p>

<p>This is the second time within weeks emergency services have launched a rescue mission for Mr Higgins and his 33ft vessel.</p>

<p>The fisherman and his friend Derek Robinson, 48, sparked South Australia's largest-ever maritime search when they went missing while travelling from Coffin Bay near Port Lincoln to Goolwa on September 3.</p>

<p>Mr Higgins said his wooden fishing boat Margrel was 'taking on water' and police have now launched another search operation with a rescue helicopter and Sea Rescue volunteers</p>

<p>The duo were one day into their trip on thewooden-hulled fishing boat when they started to experience engine trouble.</p>

<p>They were eventually found on September 10, just hours after the search operation was called off.</p>

<p>Despite missing for nearly a week, Mr Higgins claimed he had no idea about the rescue mission.</p>

<p>'We didn't even know anyone was looking for us,' Mr Higgins said at the time.</p>

<p>'I didn't ask to come get rescued. I knew exactly where we were.'</p>

<p>He believes the trouble was sparked when one of the propeller's three blades broke off after hitting a turtle or submerged log.</p>

<p>The massive search operation - covering more than 120,000 square kilometres - involved police, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and members of the Royal Australian Air Force.</p>

<p>It also involved Kangaroo Island and Volunteer Marine Rescue members.</p>

<p>Crews spent days searching an area larger than Tasmania covered in an attempt to find the men.</p>

<p>Fears were raised when the men were not located after several weather warnings and days of treacherous conditions.</p>

<p>Mr Higgins was fined $1,000 for having an out-of-date Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), as well as old flares on board and not having an appropriate recreational boat licence. </p>

<p>Fears were raised over the two men when they went missing on September 3 due to the rough conditions at sea (pictured Derek Robinson returns to shore)</p>

<p>The men were headed to Goolwa when they went missing earlier this month, from Coffin Bay near Port Lincoln, they told a friend they would try make it to Kangaroo Island after their engine failed but ended up in Salt Creek</p>

<p>Freelance video journalist Gary Juleff told the ABC when police arrived on Tuesday morning following the distress call, the boat had vanished.</p>

<p>'When I got down here, nobody could see the boat,' Mr Juleff said.</p>

<p>'(Police) tried to phone him back - no answer - so the answer to this question is 'nobody knows'.</p>

<p>'They said there's nothing out there and we don't know where he is.' </p>

<p>Over the weekend, Mr Higgins found himself in trouble again when the Margrel ran aground on a sandbar in Victor Harbor.</p>

<p>The rescue mission is ongoing.  </p>

<p>Police Commissioner Grant Stevens said a second search party for the vessel was 'frustrating' for authorities. </p>

<p>'I think it's fair to say there's an element of frustration that the state's resources are being dedicated to this for a second time,' he said.</p>

<p>'The first event cost us in the order of about $650,000.'</p>
