<p>Fame at a cost! The sizzling photo comes as the reality star, 33, admitted in a new interview that she hasn't spoke to her family since finding fame on TOWIE (pictured wit ex Mark Wright in 2011)</p>

<p>Lauren's sultry snap comes as she revealed in this week's New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. </p>

<p>She told the publication: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.</p>

<p>'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me.' </p>

<p>Lauren's mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father at just four-years-old, who started his 'own life'.  </p>

<p>She told New! magazine: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.'  </p>

<p>She added that her family 'set her up to fail': 'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".'</p>

<p>Lauren insisted that she is happy as she has her own circle of close friends, who she does family things with.</p>

<p>Yet despite not talking to her parents, Lauren recently posted a childhood photograph with her father to Instagram from when she was a bridesmaid aged five. </p>

<p>The reality star also hit back at trolls, after she was accused of being an 'attention seeker', calling herself a 'rock star'. </p>
