<p>Samuel Mark Narroway appeared in the District Court for sentencing submissions on Wednesday after pleading guilty to three counts of unlawfully wearing a police uniform, deception and aggravated false imprisonment.</p>

<p>The court was told that Narroway had also worn a police-style belt and had a car set up with flashing lights, which were used to pull over people during his offending in September last year.</p>

<p>An Adelaide man who impersonated a police officer handcuffed one of his victims and forced another to pay a bogus $300 fine, a court has heard (file picture)</p>

<p>In one instance a man had been handcuffed and placed in the back of the vehicle before being driven home.</p>

<p>It was an experience the victim said had left him anxious when driving at night and scared when approached by police.</p>

<p>Defence counsel Oliver Cole said Narroway did not shy away from the fact that he had a significant history of deception offences and that a degree of pre-planning was involved.</p>

<p>He said the items used to impersonate officers were easy to obtain over the internet in a relatively short space of time.</p>

<p>However, it was conceded the flashing lights would have appeared legitimate to unsuspecting motorists.</p>

<p>Judge Joanne Tracey said in such circumstances any rational person would pull over.</p>

<p>'That what's so horrifying about all this,' she said.</p>

<p>Mr Cole said Narroway made admissions when spoken to by police and said his offending was sparked by a 'fanciful idea' that had then 'steamrolled'.</p>

<p>He said it was also unusual in that he made no threats of violence nor intended to cause any harm.</p>

<p>The court was told that substance abuse was a 'theme' that featured across the 29-year-old's offending history.</p>

<p>Amid periods of homelessness and methamphetamine addiction, he was 'committing offences to survive', Mr Cole said.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Sophie Taylor asked for an immediate custodial sentence but conceded suspension or home detention was an option.</p>

<p>Mr Cole urged the judge to fashion a sentence that might allow his client to be released soon, considering he had already spent about a year in custody.</p>

<p>Judge Tracey called for a report into what programs might be available to Narroway while in custody to address his issues and ordered his case return to court in October.</p>
