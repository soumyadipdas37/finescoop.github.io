<p>The court was told the store noticed Lego items missing during a stock take and an investigation was launched.</p>

<p>Police searched the 34-year-old home in March 2019, and he admitted to stealing from the store for 22 months.</p>

<p>The man told police it was to fund his gambling habit, the court was told.</p>

<p>Officers also found a device to remove security tags and 15 security tags that would have been attached to stolen items, the court heard.</p>

<p>The man lost his job after his crimes were discovered, and he had been working as a support worker until a deterioration in his mental health. </p>

<p>Nick McGhee, the man's lawyer, said his client had a gambling addiction and was now seeking help for it. </p>

<p>Judge Katherine McGinness sentenced the Kmart staffer to three-and-a-half years in jail.</p>

<p>The sentence would be sentenced after he had served his months. </p>
