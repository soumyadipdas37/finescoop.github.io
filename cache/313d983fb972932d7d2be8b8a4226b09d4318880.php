<p>Scandal: The Block's Shaynna Blaze (pictured) accused contestants Luke and Jasmin of cheating during a tense conversation on Tuesday's episode</p>

<p>'I remember saying on the day, the bunk and everything, I remember saying, "I may have seen that before,"' Shaynna explained.</p>

<p>While Shaynna initially thought they had taken inspiration from former Block contestants Kyal and Kara, she said she went home and did some 'fishing'.</p>

<p>'It felt familiar, and then I found this,' she said, before pulling up a series of comparison photos on a tablet. </p>

<p>Busted: Shaynna told Luke and Jasmin (both pictured) that she had some concerns about their winning kids' bedroom, after discovering they'd completely ripped off their design</p>

<p>Luke and Jasmin's idea for their kids' bedroom had completely come from the pages of interior design magazine, Inside Out, with Shaynna pointing out all the similarities.</p>

<p>'Spotted wallpaper, bunk, animals, saffron, aztec, grey, white sheer,' she listed, pointing out that 'the only difference' was the chair and how they put it together. </p>

<p>But Jasmin didn't seem surprised by the similarities, and confessed she'd shown everyone the same photo, calling it her 'inspo'. </p>

<p>'It wasn't a secret,' added Jasmin. </p>

<p>'So, you're calling it inspiration,' continued Shaynna. 'What happens is inspiration is one thing, completely taking someone's idea and making it your own is another.'</p>

<p>Shaynna explained that it was one thing for them to copy a design for their own home, but she reminded them that they were in a competition.</p>

<p>'You haven't changed it up enough. It's not fair on the other contestants that they can win a room, with money, on someone else's ideas,' said Shaynna</p>

<p>While Luke, 35, insisted they'd 'put their own spin on it', Shaynna maintained that it was still too similar. </p>

<p>'If you scroll on Instagram, everyone's doing the same s**t... It's like, yeah, we're "original". As original as the next house,' said a resolute Jasmin.  </p>
