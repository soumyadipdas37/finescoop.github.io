<p>Lanolips reissued its popular Golden Dry Skin Miracle Salve ($19.95) on September 10 with new packaging, and it has fast reignited the public's love of the skin saviour</p>

<p>The thick balm-like cream has been formulated with 70 per cent medical grade lanolin, which comes from sheep's wool, anti-bacterial Manuka honey, and antioxidant-rich vitamin E to soothe dry skin issues (seven day difference)</p>

<p>Golden Dry Skin Miracle Salve ($19.95)</p>

<p>It lasts on the skin for over 48-hours so the customer doesn't need to keep reapplying and it can clear up major skin markings in as little as seven days.  </p>

<p>'Use on very dry skin: rough feet, itchy legs, scaly hands, parched face - it's even great on lips. For best results, apply at night to wake up dewy and hydrated,' the website read. </p>

<p>'Omg the best ever! I've since used it on a scratch from my naughty cat and it's healed so quickly,' one woman wrote on the offical Instagram page. </p>

<p>'I literally cried after trying this product on my constant dry lips, after spending hundreds on trying to find something that helped, this has been a saviour,' said another.</p>

<p>It helps to eliminate burns and scars when the wound is fresh (pictured on the face)</p>

<p>'Not only is it good for my lips...it is has helped my dermatitis on my hands which I have struggled with for so long! Much loved and used product.'</p>

<p>'The natural ingredients especially within this product are amazing! I love that there isn't petroleum jelly or any other classified substances that aren't necessarily good for the skin. I have an obsession with the texture of all Lanolips products and especially the golden dry skin salve,' said a third.</p>

<p>Another added: 'I put this on my scar last night around 10pm, it is 9am at the moment and my scar and the skin around it still feel incredibly moisturised and feel great! I don't feel that uncomfortable pulling when I stretch or reach anymore. I will definitely continue to use this'.</p>

<p>Kirsten's favourite product is still the tried-and-tested $18.99 101 multi-purpose balm</p>

<p>Lanolips founder Kirsten Carriol was first exposed to the healing effects of lanolin after her father, a molecular scientist and sheep farmer, told her that wool contains the oil, which mimics the same hydrating oils of human skin.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two launched her brand in 2009 in ode to this wonder ingredient and it has quickly picked up a large celebrity following, with the likes of Drew Barrymore, Kaley Cuoco, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Sienna Miller using the balms.</p>

<p>Kirsten's favourite product is still the tried-and-tested $18.99 101 multi-purpose balm because it's the 'beating heart of the range.' </p>
