<p>Eliminated: On Thursday, Bel Colwell (pictured) was sent packing on The Bachelor as fans raged about the 'cringeworthy' virtual rose ceremony</p>

<p>'So Bel has a rose next to her but she can't 'accept' it? What a weird way to do it? Could they have not thought of anything else,' questioned one viewer on Twitter.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, others simply raged over the virtual ceremony, labeling it 'cringeworthy' and 'awkward'. </p>

<p>'If there is anything more cringe-worthy than watching a bachelor rose ceremony being run over what must be zoom, I don't want to know about it,' wrote one fan. </p>

<p>'Awkward for the person who just gets to look at their rose and not pick it up,' quipped a second fan of the show. </p>

<p>Format fail: At the end of the episode, the show's first-ever virtual rose ceremony saw each of the remaining ladies standing by a rose. However, they could only pick it up if Locky (pictured) called out their name</p>

<p>'The girls already have a rose on a silver platter at their houses??!!! How freaking contrived is this??!!' added a third fan. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a fourth said: 'I feel like having a single rose on a platter near them [is] worse than a normal rose ceremony.'</p>

<p>Epic fail: Following the outcome, fans slammed the ceremony on Twitter, with one viewer commenting on how 'weird' it must have been for Bel, 25</p>

<p>Areeba Emmanuel, Charley Bond, Gemma White, Laura Calleri and Marg Zogoulas were all sent packing.</p>

<p>Areeba, 25, didn't hold back at the end of the episode, saying this year's Bachelor clearly had a penchant for 'basic girls'.</p>

<p>'This is definitely the first time I have ever been rejected by a guy. I don't care because he obviously likes basic girls, and that's not me. I ain't basic,' she pouted.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel Ten</p>
