<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Russia is risking a 'new Cold War' if it tries to push its power base beyond its border, Nato's secretary general has warned.</p>

<p>Jens Stoltenberg said that Moscow's recent behaviour and attempt to establish a new 'sphere of influence ... requires a response from Nato'.</p>

<p>His remarks come days after the North Atlantic Council met to discuss the attempted poisoning of Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny with Novichok.  </p>

<p>'We don't want a new Cold War, we don't want a new arms race, but at the same time we have to make sure that we are adapting as the world is changing,' Mr Stoltenberg told the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Jens Stoltenberg said that Moscow's recent behaviour and attempt to establish a new 'sphere of influence ... requires a response from Nato'</p>

<p>Mr Stoltenberg highlighted the Moscow's aggressive actions against neighbours t o establish a 'kind of sphere of influence' as central to Nato's concerns.</p>

<p>'We have seen that in Georgia, in Moldova, in Ukraine, and that requires a response from Nato.'</p>

<p>Nato, a military alliance of 30 states, is now embarking on the biggest reinforcement of collective defence 'since the end of the Cold War', with all Nato allies increasing defence spending.</p>

<p>Mr Stoltenberg added that Russian President Vladimir Putin had 'very serious questions' to answer after it emerged Putin's political opponent Mr Navalny was poisoned with novichok – the Soviet-era nerve agent used in the 2018 Salisbury attack.</p>

<p>His remarks come days after the N orth Atlantic Council met to discuss the attempted poisoning of Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny with Novichok</p>

<p>The former Norwegian PM first learned of the probability that Alexei Navalny had been poisoned with a chemical weapon in a private briefing with Angela Merkel a week before the German Chancellor announced the findings to the world.</p>

<p>'This is not the first time we’ve seen the use of poison against people in opposition to the Russian regime. That makes it more serious,' he said.</p>

<p>In Brussels, NATO called for an international probe into Navalny's poisoning and demanded Moscow reveal details of its Novichok nerve agent programme to the OPCW global chemical weapons watchdog.</p>

<p>After an emergency meeting of NATO's ruling council, Mr Stoltenberg said all members were united in condemning the 'horrific' attack on Navalny.</p>

<p>Hundreds of protestors have taken to the streets following Mr Navalny's poisoning. Pictured: A man holds up a poster with a portrait of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny reading 'Navalny was poisoned, we know who is to blame, Alexei you must live'</p>

<p>Germany briefed the other 29 nations on the case and Stoltenberg said there was 'proof beyond doubt' Novichok was used.</p>

<p>'The Russian government must fully cooperate with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on an impartial international investigation,' Stoltenberg said.</p>

<p>The Novichok attack on Skripal in 2018 led to seven Kremlin diplomats being expelled from their NATO mission.</p>

<p>While Stoltenberg did not rule out a similar reprisal this time, he stressed that the Navalny poisoning was quite different from the Skripal attack, which happened on the soil of a NATO member.</p>

<p>European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell earlier called on Moscow to cooperate with an international probe into the poisoning and said the 27-nation bloc would not rule out sanctions.</p>

<p>In Moscow, a court threw out a complaint by Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation over investigators' perceived inaction, the group said.</p>

<p>Ivan Zhdanov, head of Navalny's anti-corruption group, said Thursday the opposition politician's poisoning opened a 'new chapter' in a Kremlin crackdown on dissent.</p>

<p>'Now the Russian state will be inventing the most absurd and crazy versions of what has happened,' he told AFP. </p>

<p>Mr Stoltenberg added that Russian President Vladimir Putin had 'very serious questions' to answer after it emerged Putin's political opponent Mr Navalny was poisoned with novichok – the Soviet-era nerve agent used in the 2018 Salisbury attack</p>

<p>Russian authorities have appeared reluctant to investigate what caused Mr Navalny's condition, saying there had so far been no grounds for a criminal investigation.</p>

<p>Interior Minister Vladimir Kolokoltsev said a preliminary inquiry was ongoing, but added that he saw no signs of a crime in what happened to the most determined critic of president Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>Mr Putin's spokesman has brushed off allegations the Kremlin was involved in poisoning Mr Navalny and said Germany had not provided Moscow with any evidence about the politician's condition.</p>

<p>'We have nothing to hide,' Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said on Friday, asserting that German authorities had stonewalled Russian requests for information.</p>

<p>Mr Lavrov said the failure to provide information about Mr Navalny's poisoning could indicate a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>'Our Western partners allow themselves to make arrogant demands in such a tone that suggests that they have nothing but pathos to put on the table,' he said.</p>
