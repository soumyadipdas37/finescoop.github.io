<p>Police who evicted a young couple and their two children from their apartment in Houston last week have helped raise more than $234,000 in a bid to get the family back on their feet. Evictee Israel Rodriguez is seen with his young son, Israel Jr. </p>

<p>Harris County cops were seen evicting the young family from their Texas complex after they received multiple warnings from their landlord and the local court </p>

<p>CNN's Kyung Lah speaks with residents in Houston who are facing financial hardship as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Unable to pay their rent, they now face eviction. https://t.co/uLdLoFTDEI pic.twitter.com/2o8zLGjKDq</p>

<p>'It's my fault, because I'm supposed to be the man of the house,' Rodriguez emotionally told the news network as he cradled his youngest son.  </p>

<p>'We ain't got nowhere to go right now. It was a lot going on there with the corona. When it hit, I lost my job.' </p>

<p>Rodriguez received multiple warning messages from his landlord and the Harris County court, but he was unable to come up with the cash to cover his rent.   </p>

<p>The father-of-two showed CNN a check for $361 - all of the money he had left to his name. </p>

<p>As the family did not have a car,  most of their possessions were discarded onto the street. </p>

<p>'It's trash now,' Rodriguez stated, before telling the officers who evicted him: 'We ain't got nowhere to go.'</p>

<p>The police took no pleasure in forcing the family from their home, with Constable Alan Rosen telling CNN: 'We're human beings. It's horrible. It's horrible to have to evict somebody out of a home. This is their shelter. This is where their family life is.'</p>

<p>Constable Alan Rosen helped raise funds for Rodriguez and his family after being forced to remove the clan from their home</p>

<p>Hundreds of people have generously donated to the Rodriquez family via the GoFundMe page </p>

<p>Rosen quickly got to work starting the fundraiser for the family, buoyed by publicity from the CNN segment. </p>

<p>Houston Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson even helped bring attention to the clan's plight, posting about them to his 1.3 million Twitter followers. </p>

<p>The Constable's GoFundMe page was quickly inundated with donations, much to the delight of locals in the community.   </p>

<p>'We care. We are compassionate. We are abiding by the guidelines,' Rosen wrote on the page. </p>

<p>'It breaks our hearts to evict people. We hope the generosity demonstrated following this single story will begin a movement where we work together as a society that starts a discussion about poverty, prioritizes kindness and encourages philanthropy.'</p>

<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, $234,446 has been raised for the family. </p>

<p>Harris County Precinct 1 is giving an update on evictions, including money they raised for families that were evicted and one family that caught Deshaun Watson's attention.

<p>A second GoFundMe page - set up by a New York based teacher who saw the story on CNN - has raised $70,050. </p>

<p>Rodriguez and Rosen gave a joint press conference late last week, during which they thanked people across the country for their generous donations. </p>

<p>'It's the best thing that could ever happen to me,' Rodriguez emotionally declared.  </p>

<p>Police orders to forcibly remove Rodriguez from his home came just hours before the Trump Administration issued an executive order issuing a temporary halt in residential evictions. </p>

<p>The order gives the CDC authority to block landlords from evicting almost all tenants for failure to pay rent through the end of 2020. </p>

<p>Rodriguez was seen leaving his apartment last Wednesday. The generosity of Americans has now seen his fortunes turn around </p>
