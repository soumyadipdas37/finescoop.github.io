<p>Family: Myleene Klass, 42, has shared a heartwarming video of the moment she and fiancé Simon Motson, 45, told their children they are getting married</p>

<p>Alongside the video, Myleene wrote: 'I was asked by <?php echo e('@'); ?>tiktok to give music lessons, life lessons, show mama school, but this lesson is probably the biggest of all, so I’ve posted here in case you don’t have <?php echo e('@'); ?>tikok. </p>

<p>'I met Sim 5 years ago. My children were 4 and 7, like his. We had been through pretty much identical scenarios. What we didn’t know was that we would go on to blend/mend our families and have our own baby, our "glue".</p>

<p>'Sim gave me a promise ring when he proposed so we could design our engagement ring together...it was this gold ring that Hero spotted.</p>

<p>'We were having dinner and Sim quickly put his phone on record to catch them hearing the news. That’s why it’s a bit of a wonky shot, but it also our absolute truth. He captured it perfectly.</p>

<p>Sweet: Myleene uploaded a clip of herself and Simon sitting around the kitchen table with their children as her other half informed them Myleene had said yes to his proposal</p>

<p>'To all you blended, steps, patchwork, bonus and insta families. It’s not easy. Not everyone around you will understand or accept it. </p>

<p>'But the only people who really need to know and feel that love are those at your table, under your roof. (Baby was in bed!) it takes patience, trust, respect, more patience and ultimately, it takes love xxx. And they lived happily ever after'.</p>

<p>Myleene is mother to daughters Ava, 13, and Hero, nine, with her ex Graham Quinn while Simon has a son and daughter who are also 13 and nine.</p>

<p>The former Hear'Say singer and PR man Simon welcomed their son Apollo in August of last year. </p>

<p>Thrilled: In the clip, the kids can be seen leaping out of their chairs in excitement at the happy news as they wrap their arms around the couple in a group hug</p>

<p>Myleene previously admitted she was shocked when Simon popped the question last month on the fifth anniversary of their first date.</p>

<p>Speaking to Hello! magazine, Myleene told how Simon got down on one knee in their garden shed which he made into a replica of where they had their first date and surprised her with a nine-carat diamond ring.</p>

<p>She said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie.</p>

<p>'When he got down on one knee and started fumbling around under the table, I thought he was joking. Then I thought: "Oh my God, he's for real." I was completely speechless.' </p>

<p>Myleene and Simon began dating in 2015 after she split from husband Graham Quinn in 2012. </p>

<p>Although the star previously ruled out getting married again after her first marriage ended, she recently said she would be open to having another baby and tying the knot with businessman Simon.</p>

<p>Myleene said in an interview with Hello! magazine: 'I would not say no to another baby. I don't want to tempt fate. Who knows what life has got planned for you?</p>

<p>'We didn't know we would even get him [Apollo]. The kids would love it if we had another baby. Simon is raring to go.'</p>

<p>Romance: The media personality admitted she was shocked when her partner popped the question last month on the fifth anniversary of their first date</p>

<p>Myleene also joked that her daughters have been 'on Simon's case' to propose and said they've already got a wedding 'all planned out' for the couple.</p>

<p>She added: 'My girls are definitely on Sim's case about it [marriage]. I suppose it's just children's way of solidifying what's around them. The kids just want a party.</p>

<p>'Sim doesn't get a say in it either. It's genuinely down to the children. They've got their own conflab going on between them and have planned it all out.</p>

<p>'They have even decided the baby will be the ring bearer! There are no weddings this year. But 2021? They would love that!'</p>

<p>Myleene said: 'We're engaged! I was absolutely blown away. He even replicated the dinner we had – burger and fries, followed by cherry pie'</p>

<p>Myleene recently admitted she feared she would be a single mum to her girls forever before she met Simon.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sophie Ellis-Bextor on her podcast, Spinning Plates, she said: 'I thought I was going to be a single mum forever. The first shock of being a single mum was horrible.</p>

<p>'It's not a blueprint I recognised, when I got into the role of a single mum, I had the fear of, "How am I ever not going to be a single mum?" I really like how this flows. I really love me and my girls, it feels like it's us against the world.</p>

<p>'I love that we go everywhere together, I love that they're my three amigos, it's a really lovely feeling.'</p>
