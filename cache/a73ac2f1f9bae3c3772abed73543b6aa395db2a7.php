<p>Julija Adlesic, 22, from Slovenia, agreed with her boyfriend to sever her left hand above the wrist to claim £700,000</p>

<p>Her boyfriend was sentenced to three years in prison while his father received a one-year suspended sentence. </p>

<p>Adlesic was given two years behind bars. In hospital, Adlesic said she injured herself while sawing branches.</p>

<p>Authorities said the trio left the hand behind to ensure the disability was permanent, but police recovered it and it was reattached.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said that days before the incident, Adlesic's partner searched online for information about how artificial hands work.</p>

<p>During the trial, Adlesic claimed innocence. 'No one wants to be crippled,' she told the court. </p>
