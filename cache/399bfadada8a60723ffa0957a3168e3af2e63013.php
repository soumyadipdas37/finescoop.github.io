<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An angry mother has blasted parents for failing to follow social distancing rules outside the school gates.</p>

<p>The woman, who has asked to remain anonymous, said she was forced to push through crowds of waving mothers and fathers at Ninestiles School in Acocks Green, Birmingham, on the first day of term.</p>

<p>The academy is a secondary school and teaches pupils between 11 and 16 years old.</p>

<p>Children are returning to school after more than six months away due to the nationwide lockdown and coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>A mother slammed other parents for flouting social distancing rules at Ninestiles school in Acocks Green, Birmingham</p>

<p>A mobile phone clip posted online shows eager parents lining the entrance to the school on Thursday 3 September. It also reveals a line of parked cars creating a traffic jam on the road.</p>

<p>'You just couldn’t get through the crowd,' the mother said. 'I felt physically sick having to walk my child in-between all this.'</p>

<p>'My son was so excited for his first day at secondary school but when we turned onto the street and saw the crowd, I could just tell he was terrified by it.</p>

<p>'I am so disappointed in the parents. In fact, I am absolutely disgusted.' </p>

<p>In a letter addressed to parents, a spokesman said: 'The start and end of the school day is often a very busy time with many different groups mixing freely at the front of school.</p>

<p>'To avoid this, please do not park on Hartfield Crescent and allow students to walk the short distance from one of the larger roads such as Fox Hollies or Greenwood Avenue where more social distancing can take place.'</p>

<p>Cars were also shown parked on the roadside, causing a queue of vehicles outside the school</p>

<p>The frustrated parent has since called for more to be done to combat the huge queues.</p>

<p>She added: 'We are supposed to be a prime example to our children - but there was no social distancing whatsoever.</p>

<p>'The school has signs up and we even had letters sent out. Yet, still, parents took no notice. We have been in lockdown for four months so social distancing shouldn’t really be hard now.'</p>

<p>The academy's principal, James Power, said in a statement released today: 'We have asked parents and carers to follow social distancing requirements outside the school and to keep traffic to a minimum in the vicinity of the school. </p>

<p>'We are grateful to those parents who have followed this request and I now appeal to everyone to do so and to lead by example. </p>

<p>'We have made great efforts to implement measures within the school to enable students and staff to be kept safe and to follow our strict hygiene regulations and we want to ensure that the approach to school is equally safe.' </p>
