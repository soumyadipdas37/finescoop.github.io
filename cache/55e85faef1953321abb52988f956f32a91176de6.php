<p>Craig Hopkins' wife Narelle died after outside their home in Coldstream in Victoria on February 17, 2019.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old had fled the house in his Hyundai i20 after having an argument with his spouse and returned to find her closing the front gate outside.</p>

<p>Hopkins told police he was 'being an idiot' when he hit the accelerator and at 18km/h slammed into the gate, which swung and hit his wife of 22 years and knocked her over.</p>

<p>The 45-year-old hit her head on the ground and died in hospital six weeks later.</p>

<p>Hopkins pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing death after Melbourne magistrate Susan Wakeling said she intended to put him behind bars during a hearing in August.  </p>

<p>'The matter of driving and the moral culpability of Mr Hopkins calls for a sentence of imprisonment,' Ms Wakeling said, The Herald Sun reported</p>

<p>Hopkins was sentenced to three months in jail and must do 150 hours of unpaid community work and mental health therapy.</p>

<p>Ms Wakeling said there was no history of criminal activity from Hopkins or domestic violence between the couple.</p>

<p>She said Hopkins felt remorse from 'the loss of a family member, a partner and a best friend'.</p>

<p>Two other charges of driving in a dangerous manner and reckless conduct endangering life were dropped after Hopkins' guilty plea. </p>

<p>Hopkins said he thought his wife was going to open the gate and let him 'drive straight through' and pulled up his hand break when he saw he was going to crash.</p>

<p>He was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the incident.</p>

<p>His daughter Brooke wrote online after her mother's death that their 'perfect' family had been broken after the 'freak accident'. </p>
