<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>AFL coach Stuart Dew has landed in hot water after being videoed urinating outside a Gold Coast nightclub, in another embarrassing moment for the league in the state.</p>

<p>Dew, 41, was videoed outside the Miami Tavern Shark Bar urinating against a wall at a drink with fellow senior members of the Gold Coast Suns staff.</p>

<p>It is not known exactly when the video was shot, but it surfaced just a hours after his side's final game of the severely interrupted 2020 season.</p>

<p>Dew was reportedly filmed urinating by his colleague before the video was shared to a WhatsApp group and eventually wound up online, The Courier Mail reports.</p>

<p>The morning after the video was shot the staffer reportedly realised his mistake and asked anyone in the WhatsApp group to delete it - but it was already too late.</p>

<p>Dew turns to the camera after finishing relieving himself and smiles awkwardly.</p>

<p>Under Queensland law, anyone caught urinating in public faces a fine of $533.80.</p>

<p>Gold Coast Suns chief executive Mark Evans confirmed the incident when contacted by The Courier Mail, but refused to comment further.</p>

<p>In the background of the video Dew can be heard by his fellow colleagues, including one who asks: 'Do you play for the Canterbury Bulldogs?'</p>

<p>The NRL side has landed in hot water repeatedly in recent years for off-field dramas.</p>

<p>The former Port Adelaide and Hawthorn champion took over as coach of the battling team at the beginning of 2019 and has widely been praised for developing the side. </p>

<p>It is not known exactly when the video was shot, but it surfaced just a hours after his side's final game of the severely interrupted 2020 season on Sunday</p>

<p>Several AFL players have been sent home from Queensland for breaching COVID-19 rules </p>

<p>AFL players and their families were holed up at the league's hotel hub under increasingly strict conditions (pictured, AFL stars and WAGs relaxing by the pool at the Mercure Resort on the Gold Coast)</p>

<p>Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has come under fire for allowing the AFL to set up private hubs in the state she controls, after a number of players and officials were involved in scandals.</p>

<p>Richmond Tigers pair Sydney Stack and Callum Coleman-Jones were sent home and banned for 10 weeks after getting into a fight outside a strip club.</p>

<p>The AFL is also currently investigating Harley Bennell for a potential breach of strict COVID-19 rules that were agreed upon so the league could set up in the state.</p>

<p>There have been similar issues in other hubs around the country, including in Perth where Sydney Swans star Elijah Taylor was caught sneaking his then girlfriend into his team's private hotel accommodation.</p>

<p>Police have since charged Taylor with domestic violence offences after an alleged incident involving he and the same woman, his now ex-girlfriend, Lekahni Pearce.  </p>
