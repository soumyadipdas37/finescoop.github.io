<p>Earlier this year, the restaurant delighted diners everywhere after the chef revealed his secret to cooking scrambled eggs to perfection.</p>

<p>'The secret to our super creamy scrambled eggs? Move quick on the pan - and don't hold out on the cultured butter,' the owner of Bills wrote on Instagram.</p>

<p>Many regular customers revealed it's their go-to dish when dining at Bills, which has three restaurants in Darlinghurst, Surry Hills and Bondi Beach.</p>

<p>'Always a favourite of mine,' one diner wrote, while another added: 'You guys have the best scrambled eggs ever. No one else compares.'</p>

<p>The food critic said it's the Sydney restaurant she goes to for her favourite scrambled eggs</p>

<p>Melissa's favourite dish comes just months after her MasterChef co-host Andy Allen shared his simple cooking tricks to make the perfect 'restaurant-quality' scrambled eggs in just 10 seconds.</p>

<p>The co-owner of Three Blue Ducks said one of the most common questions he gets asked at his restaurant is 'how do you make your scrambled eggs for breakfast?'</p>

<p>The celebrity chef said all you need are eggs, salt and oil.   </p>

<p>'We call them 'the 10 second eggs',' Andy said in a 'how-to' MasterChef video.</p>

<p>To make one serving of fluffy scrambled eggs, he whisked two eggs in a bowl until they have a 'smooth' consistency and then seasoned with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>'Here's the trick, we want a nice hot pan,' Andy explained.</p>

<p>To make the fluffy scrambled eggs, the celebrity chef said all you need are eggs, salt and oil</p>

<p>Over high heat, Andy then poured the mixture into the pan and as the curds started to form, he quickly used a silicone spatula to move the eggs around </p>

<p>He opted for grape seed oil because it's better suited for cooking eggs at a higher temperature.</p>

<p>'I'm using grape seed oil, which has got a high smoke point. You can also use rice bran or vegetable oil,' Andy said.</p>

<p>'We want to stay away from olive oil for this [dish] because we put the eggs in just before our oil starts to smoke.'</p>

<p>Over high heat, Andy then poured the mixture into the pan and as the curds started to form, he quickly used a silicone spatula to move the eggs around.</p>

<p>'Have your spatula ready because this only takes 10 seconds,' he said.</p>

<p>'Eggs in to a nice hot pan... you can see that they're just starting to cook around the outside, and in one kind of big smooth motion, we're just moving the eggs.'</p>

<p>After 10 seconds, Andy said you should see the eggs are 'just set'.</p>

<p>'We take them out [of the pan],' he said.</p>

<p>The chef said you can serve the scrambled eggs over toasted sourdough.</p>

<p>'There it is, 10 second eggs, no excuses. All you'll need is a hot pan, two eggs and 10 seconds, everyone can do that,' he added.</p>
