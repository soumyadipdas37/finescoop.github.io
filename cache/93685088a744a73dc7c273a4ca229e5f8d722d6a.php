<p>The 35-year-old TV star will step in for the show's debut in late September as Len is poised to remain in the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'This show has been and will always be incredibly special to me,' said Hough. 'Coming back feels like coming home and I couldn't be more excited to be back in the ballroom.' His sister Julianne Hough has served as a judge in the past as well.</p>

<p>Back for more: Derek Hough is replacing Len Goodman on Dancing with the Stars</p>

<p>A break: The 35-year-old TV star is set to replace Len - who is poised to remain in the UK due to the coronavirus pandemic - as a judge during the upcoming season of the show</p>

<p>Len, 76, will still be a part of the show, but he'll be sharing his dancing expertise remotely.</p>

<p>The new season of the long-running program will also see Tyra Banks replace Tom Bergeron as the host.</p>

<p>And the 46-year-old beauty recently teased what fans should expect from the upcoming series.</p>

<p>Looking forward to her new role, she said: 'I think it's important to continue to make sure that younger people are watching the show with their older family members, that co-viewing, of bringing everybody together.'</p>

<p>His other show: Derek has been on World Of Dance with Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo</p>

<p>Tyra is also keen to bring some of her own ideas to fruition during the new series.</p>

<p>However, the model has insisted she won't be taking a 'sledgehammer' to the 'Dancing with the Stars' format.</p>

<p>Speaking about her own ambitions for the show, Tyra explained: 'I have some ideas on having a little popular dance mixed [in], we have some ideas, we'll be testing that and seeing how people are feeling that.</p>

<p>'And there's some other things I'm not supposed to share, but, trying to turn it up a notch!</p>

<p>'But not too much, because the show is a hit. I'm not coming here with a sledgehammer ... that'd be dumb. So just adding some sprinkle pixie dust to it.' </p>

<p>Hough, 35, a professional dancer and older brother of Julianne Hough, who won the MirrorBall trophy a record six times, was a dancer on the show from 2007 to 2016.</p>

<p>He has since been keeping busy as a judge on NBC's World of Dance alongside Jennifer Lopez and Ne-Yo. </p>

<p>Derek's return: Four years after leaving ABC's hit reality series Dancing With the Stars, Derek Hough is slated to return</p>

<p>Carrie Ann Inaba, Bruno Tomoli and Len have served as the longtime judges on the show.</p>

<p>ABC made the surprising announcement in July that longtime host Tom Bergeron, who has hosted all 28 seasons of the show, is leaving, along with longtime co-host Erin Andrews.</p>
