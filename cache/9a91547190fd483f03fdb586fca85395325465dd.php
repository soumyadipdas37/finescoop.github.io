<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The US Ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, is stepping down, Mike Pompeo announced today, amid an impasse over trade, Hong Kong and coronavirus.</p>

<p>The Secretary of State thanked Branstad, tweeting that he had 'contributed to rebalancing US-China relations so that it is results-oriented, reciprocal, and fair.'</p>

<p>The reasons for the ambassador's departure were not immediately clear, and China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs - while acknowledging Pompeo's tweet - said it had not received notice of his resignation.</p>

<p>However, the former two-term Iowa governor, 73, roiled Beijing earlier this month with an opinion piece penned for the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, which had accused China of 'exploiting' US openness in recent years.</p>

<p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted early on Monday to announce that Branstad was stepping down from his post</p>

<p>Branstad had been in office since May 2017, representing Washington in Beijing during a period of strained ties with China, marked by tensions over trade, regional territorial claims, the coronavirus pandemic, and unrest in Hong Kong.</p>

<p>In June, he was summoned by Beijing after President Donald Trump signed a law that paved the way for sanctions over Hong Kong, an action the foreign ministry slammed as 'gross interference in China's internal affairs'.</p>

<p>Last year, he called on Beijing to open a 'substantive dialogue' with the Dalai Lama during a rare visit to Tibet, a region where the central government is accused of widespread repression.</p>

<p>Branstad's article for the People's Daily last week prompted a war of words between Washington and Beijing, who said it was not fit for publication.</p>

<p>The US Embassy had contacted the People's Daily on August 26 about the piece, asking that it be printed in full without any edits by September 9. </p>

<p>Pompeo tweeted that the Communist Party refused to run Branstad's op-ed while the Chinese ambassador to the United States 'is free to publish in any U.S. media outlet.'</p>

<p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian responded that Branstad's article was 'full of loopholes, seriously inconsistent with facts and wantonly attacks and smears China.'  </p>

<p>An early supporter of Trump's run for the White House in 2016, Branstad was appointed soon after the election.</p>

<p>At the time, Trump's transition team praised his 'tremendous understanding of China and Chinese people.'</p>

<p>He was reported to have a long-standing relationship with Chinese President Xi Jinping, whom he first met in the 1980s.</p>

<p>However, many of the tariffs remain and it fails to tackle Beijing's colossal subsidies of Chinese companies which American CEOs have long decried for stacking global markets against them.</p>

<p>Trump says these issues can be ironed out in 'phase two' of the deal.</p>
