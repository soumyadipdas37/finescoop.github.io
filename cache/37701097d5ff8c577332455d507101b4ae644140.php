<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>These are the 12 seconds of police interview footage which reveal VIP paedophile ring fantasist Carl Beech was lying to officers about being abused as a child, body language experts claim.</p>

<p>The experts say the video footage contains key giveaways that the fantasist made up the sick claims against a group of powerful men, including MPs and top military officers.</p>

<p>Eventually, after police launched a £2million investigation into the false claims, officers turned the table on Beech, who was not only found to be lying, but to be hoarding child abuse images himself.</p>

<p>In May 2019, he was jailed for 18 years for perverting the course of justice, fraud and obtaining child pornography.</p>

<p>Now, in a new documentary set to be aired tomorrow, body language experts have analysed Beech's behaviour from recordings of him making his claims to the police.</p>

<p>They include the shocking moment Beech claimed he had witnessed another boy be killed at the hands of his so-called abusers.   </p>

<p>In the documentary, named 'Faking It: Tears of a Crime', a panel of British experts in psychology, body language and speech analyse video footage of Beech's police interviews frame-by-frame.</p>

<p>They then pinpoint the moments Beech let the truth slip by feigning sadness, shedding crocodile tears and with a 12-second long pause of anxiety when challenged about the credibility of his story.</p>

<p>Reviewing the footage, one of the experts, Professor of Linguistics Dawn Archer, says: 'There's long pauses throughout, and those long pauses serve to punctuate the chunks of information he gives.</p>

<p>'But when you look at those chunks of information, they're somewhat mysterious,' she says. The number of pauses gives him thinking time.'</p>

<p>As Beech's story begins to crack, she says: 'We get a 12-second pause. Now, Beech has used pauses throughout, but 12-seconds is another indicator that he's disengaged. He's not playing anymore.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, body language expert Cliff Lansley pinpoints a cluster of behaviours that strongly indicate that Beech was faking his story all along.</p>

<p>He says: 'We can see a slight head shake 'no,' contradicting the claim that he was taken out of school.</p>

<p>'We've also got a micro-gesture from the left shoulder.</p>

<p>'You will see a slight raising and dropping of the shoulder which contradicts the statement 'I was just taken out of school,' a very small movement, less than a centimetre, which is suggesting that he's not connected to the words he's saying.'  </p>

<p>In another video, Beech is visibly upset, with his head down and reaching for a tissue.</p>

<p>Looking at the footage, Cliff highlights moments in Beech's (pictured) behaviour that suggest his anxieties are beginning to surface as he continues to spin his convoluted web of lies</p>

<p>Backing Beech as a credible source, The Met Police launched Operation Midland was launched in November 2014, aiming to bring this so-called paedophile ring to justice. Pictured: Police launched an investigation  at Dolphin Square following claims made by Beech</p>

<p>But as Cliff asserts, Beech is play acting for the officers, putting on a display of crocodile tears to dupe them into believing his wild story.</p>

<p>'A dry sniff, no tears, he's drawn a tissue as a prop and he's not used it. In other words, if there were tears, he'd use a tissue.</p>

<p>'He's trying to portray a demeanor of being sad about a lost friend, but all this is faked. This is a faked story.'</p>

<p>In other footage, Beech is pictured with his head down and stroking his leg as he explains to officers how the group operated.</p>

<p>'Here, we see another form of manipulation, where he's grooming his leg, he's self-comforting.</p>

<p>'His head is down, he's feeling anxious, and the anxiety will be being driven by having no detail that is reliable that he can present to the officers to try and suggest that he's being abused.'</p>

<p>Backing Beech as a credible source, The Met Police launched Operation Midland was launched in November 2014, aiming to bring this so-called paedophile ring to justice.</p>

<p>In 2014, hospital inspector Carl Beech approached the Metropolitan Police claiming that, as a child, he and others were sexually abused by a group of powerful men, a so-called VIP paedophile ring of MPs and Military Officers that went to the very top of the British establishment.</p>

<p>He even claimed to have witnessed one boy's death at the hands of this group of abusers.</p>

<p>With Beech as their key witness, known only as 'Nick' to the media, the police launched Operation Midland, a £2million widespread investigation aiming to bring this elite group of offenders to justice.</p>

<p>As his claims were escalated, the details of Beech's allegations became more elaborate, telling police how he witnessed the death of another boy brought in and abused by the group </p>

<p>In 2014, hospital inspector Carl Beech (pictured left) approached the Metropolitan Police claiming that, as a child, he (pictured right in a court sketch) and others were sexually abused by a group of powerful men, a so-called VIP paedophile ring of MPs and Military Officers that went to the very top of the British establishment.</p>

<p>But the truth was more shocking than they could have anticipated, as there was no VIP paedophile ring.</p>

<p>Instead, Beech had fabricated the story, spinning a web of lies and revelling in the attention. </p>

<p>As the investigation rumbled on, the police struggled to corroborate the information Beech was giving them.  </p>

<p>Eventually, the tables were turned on Beech as police started digging into his personal affairs.</p>

<p>In a shocking twist, officers discovered images of child abuse on Beech's computer as well as disturbing pictures he had drawn.</p>

<p>With the investigation flipped on its head, Beech was now the one facing allegations of sexual abuse. </p>

<p>Forensic Psychologist Kerry Daynes, who will speak as part of the documentary, said: 'I think that Beech really enjoyed the attention he got but it's all got just a bit too big.</p>

<p>'He never could have anticipated that this would have blown up in the way that it has done.'</p>

<p>In May 2019, Beech stood trial and was found guilty of perverting the course of justice, fraud and obtaining child pornography.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. For Daniel Janner QC, the son of former.</p>

<p>Labour MP Greville Janner who was one of the names put forward by Beech, the verdict put to bed years of stress for him and his family.</p>

<p>'When I heard about these allegations about my father, I, along with other members of the family, was so upset that it did have a physical reaction, I vomited when I heard the allegation was made,' he says in the documentary. </p>

<p>'I told the judge the horrendous affect that these allegations had on my family, and I was pleased to do it in the presence of the jury and Carl Beech himself. He is a manipulative plainly sad but wicked man.' </p>

<p>Faking It: Tears of a Crime airs at 10pm on Saturdays on Quest Red.</p>
