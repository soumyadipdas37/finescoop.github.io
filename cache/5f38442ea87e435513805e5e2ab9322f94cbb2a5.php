<p>And it seems the Melbourne nurse isn't yet done with reality TV, telling The Wash this week that she has her sights set on MasterChef. </p>

<p>Top chef: Irena Srbinovska (pictured) is the frontrunner to win Locky Gilbert's heart on the latest season of The Bachelor. And it seems the Melbourne nurse isn't yet done with reality TV, telling The Wash this week that she has her sights set on MasterChef</p>

<p>'I would be flattered if MasterChef asked me to be a part of their show,' she said on Friday.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old is a talented chef who in 2013 won first place at the Tastes of Central Geelong food festival with her 10-layer coffee cake. </p>

<p>In 2014, she won again with her delicious macaroons - of which she made a whopping 500. </p>

<p>Headed their way? The keen bake told the website she is keen to take part in the cooking show. Pictured: MasterChef Australia judges Melissa Leong, Jock Zonfrillo and Andy Allen </p>

<p> She can do it! 'I would be flattered if MasterChef asked me to be a part of their show,' she said on Friday</p>

<p>Keen! Irena told The Huffington Post that she loves baking. 'I've always wanted to work in the food industry, like having my own vegan cafe is my dream,' she said. Pictured: Her creations </p>

<p>She told The Huffington Post that she loves baking and almost opened her own local cafe.</p>

<p>'I've always wanted to work in the food industry, like having my own vegan cafe is my dream,' she told the paper.   </p>

<p>It comes after photos surfaced that seemingly prove Irena is the winner of The Bachelor.</p>

<p>The nurse has long been the favourite to win, and new paparazzi pictures strongly suggest she gets the final rose. </p>

<p>What an effort! The 31-year-old is a talented chef who in 2013 won first place at the Tastes of Central Geelong food festival with her 10-layer coffee cake</p>

<p>They look good! In 2014, she won again with her delicious macaroons - of which she made a whopping 500</p>

<p>While there is no 'money shot' of Locky and Irena together, photographers staking out her home in Melbourne have noticed that her car hasn't moved in a week.  </p>

<p>Her 'disappearance' has led some insiders to suspect she was secretly whisked off to Sydney a week ago ahead of the season finale, which airs next Thursday.</p>

<p>If Locky and Irena are indeed a couple - and Channel 10 insists he's still dating his winner - then they will be contractually obliged to do press together the next day.</p>

<p>In order for Irena to be available for media interviews in Sydney by next Friday, she would have to have left Melbourne last week. </p>

<p> It could be her! The nurse has long been the favourite to win The Bachelor.  Pictured on the show with Locky Gilbert</p>
