<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> Birmingham City are closing on a deal for Cardiff City goalkeeper Neil Etheridge.</p>

<p>The 30-year old was a target for West Ham earlier in the window but, with David Moyes focusing their attentions on bringing in a centre-back, Etheridge is ready to make his move to Cardiff’s Championship rivals Birmingham.</p>

<p>Etheridge was Cardiff’s player of the year in 2019 but has been on the periphery under manager Neil Harris after picking up a hamstring injury last year and speculation over West Ham’s interest.</p>

<p>Cardiff City goalkeeper Neil Etheridge looks set to join Birmingham City in the coming days</p>

<p>Etheridge also had interest from Aston Villa last season but, with his lack of match action, they moved on to other targets.</p>

<p>The Philippines international is now looking to link up with Aitor Karanka at St Andrews as he builds a squad capable of mounting a serious promotion challenge.</p>
