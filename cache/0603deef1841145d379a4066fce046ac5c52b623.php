<p>This week best-selling novelist Joanne Harris checks in to our travel Q&amp;A. </p>

<p>She talks about her 'amazing trip' to Sao Tome and Principe, her favourite destination, where she'd like to visit next - and more...  </p>

<p>MOST MEMORABLE PLACE YOU’VE VISITED?</p>

<p>The islands of Sao Tome and Principe, a Portuguese colony-turned-nation off the west coast of central Africa. They have the most amazing beaches and wildlife.</p>

<p>EARLIEST HOLIDAY MEMORY?</p>

<p>Going to the island of Noirmoutier, on the west coast of France, where my maternal French grandfather had a holiday home. I’d swim, sail and play on the beach - happy days.</p>

<p>WHAT INSPIRED YOUR NOVEL CHOCOLAT?</p>

<p>A trip to Nerac, in the south-west of France, where my grandfather had an old war buddy.</p>

<p>MUST-HAVE FRENCH PHRASE?</p>

<p>The French like to be greeted - you can go a long way with just a ‘Bonjour Monsieur’ or ‘Bonjour Madame’.</p>

<p>YOU’RE FROM YORKSHIRE – BEST PLACE TO GO?</p>

<p>The Dales and Moors for walking, and the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, near Wakefield, which was the first of its kind in the UK.</p>

<p>IDEAL TRAVEL COMPANION?</p>

<p>For a long time, I’d travel abroad with my daughter Anouchka because my husband Kevin doesn’t fly. But now she’s married, we tend to travel differently - often by train.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE DESTINATION?</p>

<p>Joanne says that her favourite destination is Hawaii. Pictured is Kualoa Point, Oahu </p>

<p>I loved Hawaii. I’m a good swimmer so I particularly enjoy visiting anywhere by the sea.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE HOTEL?</p>

<p>I got to stay in the Constance Prince Maurice in Mauritius when I was judging a literary prize. It’s mostly posh beach huts, so it was like living as the most luxurious type of castaway you could imagine.</p>

<p>HOW DO YOU RELAX ON HOLIDAY?</p>

<p>By not wearing a watch or having too much of an itinerary. </p>

<p>ANY TRAVEL TIPS?</p>

<p>Pack light — I manage well with just a couple of T-shirts, a swimming costume, a hat, sun block and sandals. I rarely have to check in luggage.</p>

<p>WHERE ARE YOU GOING NEXT?</p>

<p>Joanne says she would love to travel to Sicily, pictured, by train on her next holiday </p>

<p>I’d love to travel to Sicily by train — I became a fan of the Italian police drama Inspector Montalbano during lockdown.</p>

<p>HAS COVID SCUPPERED YOUR TRAVEL PLANS?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I was going to go to south-west France, but that’s gone out of the window...</p>

<p>ANY STAYCATION TIPS?</p>

<p>I’d rent a house in Haworth - Wuthering Heights country — and run around on the Moors all day. </p>

<p>DREAM DESTINATION?</p>

<p>I’ve always fancied going to Iceland, which just seems a very special place.</p>
