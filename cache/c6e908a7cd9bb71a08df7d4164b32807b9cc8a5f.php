<p>'The biggest thing I've learnt being a mum is that you can't plan a lot. You just have to breeeeeeathe,' she told Body + Soul magazine.</p>

<p>She also revealed that her sleeping has been seriously interrupted now that Frankie is her new 'alarm clock'.</p>

<p>'I wake up between five and seven AM - depending on when she wakes up,' she said.</p>

<p>Motherhood: Jennifer's post comes after she revealed how her daily routine has changed since becoming a mother</p>

<p>'I check in on Frankie. Sometimes she'll just be babbling, happily in her cot. So usually the first thing I do is just get up and feed her. I can't lie!'</p>

<p>Jennifer also loves taking Frankie for walks throughout the day, but their evening routine is by far her 'favourite time'.</p>

<p>'From five - it's bath time, and I have a bath with her, which I love. Then Jake comes home from work, then Frankie goes down from between 6.30 to 7pm and then we have "adult time" - it's important! It's really nice,' she said.</p>
