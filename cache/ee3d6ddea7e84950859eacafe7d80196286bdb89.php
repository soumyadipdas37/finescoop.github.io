<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea legend Petr Cech has hinted that Chelsea could sign a new goalkeeper but has insisted the club have not given up on Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>

<p>The Spaniard had a poor 2019-20 season in which he was dropped numerous times by manager Frank Lampard, including for the FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal.</p>

<p>This has resulted in speculation that the 25-year-old could be sold during the summer transfer window.</p>

<p>Chelsea could be on the lookout to buy a new goalkeeper to replace Kepa Arrizabalaga</p>

<p>Petr Cech has claimed that Chelsea might buy a new keeper but haven't given up on Kepa</p>

<p>Speaking to Sport.CZ, Cech who is now a technical and performance advisor at Stamford Bridge said: 'Kepa struggled last season, that is unquestionable.</p>

<p>'But the club invested in him and gave him a long-term contract because they believe he has the qualities and attributes to be successful.</p>

<p>'Additions will be made to the squad, perhaps even in goal, and this is what is being discussed now.</p>

<p>'But nobody is giving up on Kepa and we all hope he has a great future.'</p>

<p>Cech is one of Chelsea's greatest goalkeepers, winning four Premier League titles and a Champions League trophy during his 11-years spent at the club.</p>

<p>There were high hopes for Arrizabalaga after he joined Stamford Bridge for £71m in August 2018, though his performances have failed to match his hefty transfer fee. </p>

<p>Kepa had a tough 2019-20 season where he was often benched by manager Frank Lampard</p>

<p>The Spaniard has four-years left on a £150,000-a-week contract and it is believed that Kepa is keen to fight for his position at Chelsea.</p>

<p>Chelsea have been linked with several goalkeepers over the summer including Jan Oblak, Edouard Mendy, Nick Pope and Dean Henderson.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard's side have splashed out the cash spending £136m on Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva, with Kai Havertz also expected to join the club. </p>
