<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A rude note left on a parked car has sparked a heated debate about snobby suburbs and whether it's appropriate to park on a front lawn. </p>

<p>A homeowner from Claremont, an affluent suburb in west Perth, has come under fire for leaving the 'very rude' and 'snobbish' message on a car parked on their lawn.  </p>

<p>The note triggered a social media firestorm for taking aim at Balga, a suburb 12kms north of Perth's CBD, when it was shared to social media on Monday.   </p>

<p>'This is not Balga. Park in the street, not on the lawn. Don't park here again,' the message read. </p>

<p>A homeowner in Claremont, an affluent suburb in west Perth, left a 'discriminatory' note (pictured above) on a car that was parked on their front lawn </p>

<p>The homeowner came under fire for the accusatory message and was labelled 'a freaking snob' (pictured) by social media commenters who read the note on Monday </p>

<p>The 'antagonistic and discriminatory' note quickly caused commenters to label the message an act of 'total and utter snobbery'.   </p>

<p>'What a freaking snob! I've lived in Balga, Midland, Gosnells, Bassendean, Beechboro, Scarborough.</p>

<p>'All suburbs have their 'riff raff' and all have their so called 'pillars of society'.</p>

<p>Do you think it's okay to park on the front lawn?</p>

<p>Do you think it's okay to park on the front lawn?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>'Have they actually lived in Balga to make this comparison? I doubt it,' one user wrote.     </p>

<p>'The message displayed here is antagonistic and way out of line.'  </p>

<p>'Suburbs do not make people. Most people living in so-called affluent suburbs are rotten through and through,' another commenter said.  </p>

<p>Other users pointed out that cars parked on front lawns could damage sprinkler systems. </p>

<p>'I too had that problem. I spoke and left messages on the person's windscreen because we had sprinklers.  </p>

<p>The Claremont homeowner (Claremont pictured) criticised the driver for parking on their verge and took aim at the northern suburb of Balga, 12kms north of Perth's CBD </p>

<p>Social media users defended Balga (Balga pictured above) and criticised residents from 'so-called affluent suburbs' for being 'rotten' and 'antagonistic' </p>

<p>'Most lawns have a sprinkler system in place and cars do cause breakage when they drive off,' one commenter said.      </p>

<p>Other users defended the note and condemned the driver for parking on the verge. </p>

<p>'I would also be annoyed if someone parked on my lawn without permission.' </p>

<p>'If that's what it takes to get people not to park on somebody else's lawn fair enough.' </p>

<p>'I wouldn't leave a note. There would be spikes in their tyres,' one user wrote.  </p>

<p>The median price of a house in Balga is $298,250, in comparison to $1,448,890 in Claremont. </p>

<p>All councils in Perth state 'to park on a verge you will need the permission of the owner of the premises adjacent to the verge.'  </p>

<p>A council spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia failure to obtain this permission could result in a visit from a parking ranger and a $100 fine. </p>

<p>Commenters defended the driver and labelled the homeowner as 'arrogant' </p>
