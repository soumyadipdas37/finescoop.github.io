<p>Brown is then shown running from the town centre back to his flat in Holton Road to retrieve a flick knife before he is seen walking back to the town centre to go after Mr Davies again. </p>

<p>He is then seen throwing what appear to be punches but are in fact stabs in the direction of Mr Davies' body.</p>

<p>The final frames show Brown, having changed his clothes, walking from his flat before discarding his clothes in an alleyway off Digby Street.</p>

<p>Following the verdict senior investigating officer detective inspector Matt Powell said: 'Today concludes a South Wales Police major crime investigation into the murder of Jordan Davies which took place in Holton Road, Barry.</p>

<p>The final frames show Brown (pictured), having changed his clothes, walking from his flat before discarding his clothes in an alleyway off Digby Street</p>

<p>'Following a confrontation in the street with his then-friend Jordan Brown he was stabbed three times with one fatal wound to his chest.</p>

<p>'Mr Davies collapsed and Brown fled from the scene, discarding his clothes in a nearby lane.</p>

<p>'Despite the best efforts of members of the public and extensive medical treatment by medical professionals who attended the scene Mr Davies sadly did not survive.</p>

<p>'Jordan Davies' family have shown tremendous courage and dignity. They have waited patiently due to delays brought about by the current pandemic to see justice delivered.</p>

<p>'We hope the outcome at Cardiff Crown Court today can go some way in helping them to recover from this tragedy.</p>

<p>'This tragic case yet again highlights the devastating and far-reaching consequences of knife crime.</p>

<p>'I cannot stress enough the importance of loved ones reporting their concerns if they suspect someone they know is carrying a knife or involved in knife crime.</p>

<p>'Speaking out could, quite simply, save a life.'</p>
