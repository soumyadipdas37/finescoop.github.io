<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Queen's land and property empire has fallen in value by £552.5million after a sudden drop in rental income from shops hit by coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>Regents Street and St James's in London as well as retail parks across the country are included in the Crown Estates. </p>

<p>It has been revalued at £13.4billion in annual results published today - after a tough year for retail sales, reported the Guardian.</p>

<p>Figures also showed a profit of £345million in the year up until March 31, when the UK went into a nationwide lockdown to try to stem the spread of Covid-19.</p>

<p>The early profit, which was up 0.4 per cent from last year, suggested the value of the estates would have risen if not for the impact of coronavirus.</p>

<p>All profits are handed to the Treasury which then passes 25 per cent of the funds back to the royal family in the form of the Sovereign Grant. </p>

<p>But the difficult financial year has left the Crown Estate making staggered payments to the Treasury to ensure it has enough revenue reserves to support itself.</p>

<p>The Crown Estates has so far collected 52 per cent of rents from retail tenants in central London and 53 per cent outside the capital this year.</p>

<p>The rental income from officers in central London in 88 per cent. </p>

<p>Dan Labbad, the Crown Estate's chief executive, said the country's retail parks were slowly recovering.</p>

<p>'We've seen most of our retail and food and beverage come back and want to open where they are still trading.</p>

<p>The St James's area of Westminster is also included within the Crown Estates. Rental incomes have fallen as footfall stagnated amid lockdown</p>

<p>'There have been a number of CVAs [company voluntary arrangements] and administrations,' he said.</p>

<p>Company Voluntary Arrangements involve coming to an agreement over how best to settle debts. This could include paying only a proportion of the amount that a company owes to creditors.</p>

<p>Mr Labbad said London's West End was 'slowly filling up again' following the Government's successful Eat Out To Help Out scheme. </p>

<p>The Crown Estates' income comes from rents paid by a number of retail outlets across the UK. Other funds may come from interests in agricultural land and forests.</p>

<p>Shopping centres owned by the crown include: </p>

<p>The Crown Estate owns virtually all of the UK's seabed to the 12-nautical-mile (22 km) limit.</p>

<p>Holdings consist of around 116,000 hectares (287,000 acres) of agricultural land and forests, together with minerals and residential and commercial property.</p>

<p>In 2002 The Crown Estate started a £1 billion investment programme to improve Regent Street. They are also investing £500 million in St James's, including a number of major redevelopments.</p>
