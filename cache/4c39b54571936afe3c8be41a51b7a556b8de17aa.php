<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's bid to reaffirm his control over his party was met yesterday with claims from the hard-Left that he could betray Jeremy Corbyn's legacy.</p>

<p>MPs loyal to the former leader warned Sir Keir not to abandon Mr Corbyn's 'overwhelmingly popular' Left-wing agenda.</p>

<p>But Labour Party officials hit back by condemning Mr Corbyn for holding high-profile events at this week's 'virtual' party conference.</p>

<p>The conference – relegated to an online virtual rally owing to Covid-19 – begins today with the party unveiling the slogan 'A New Leadership'.</p>

<p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's bid to reaffirm his control over his party was met yesterday with claims from the hard-Left that he could betray Jeremy Corbyn's legacy</p>

<p>The phrase replaces 'Under New Management' which Sir Keir, who replaced Mr Corbyn in May, has been using during the summer. </p>

<p>But at an online rally for the Socialist Campaign Group on Monday, party figures loyal to the Left-wing agenda charted by the former leader will warn Sir Keir not to 'lurch to the Right' by burying Mr Corbyn's policy platform.</p>

<p>Former Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jon Trickett is set to use the event to launch a thinly veiled rebuke of the new leader for failing to set out a vision that will take Labour back to power. </p>

<p>In an article to coincide with the rally, he will warn: 'We can't cross our fingers and expect to win the next Election by default.'</p>

<p>He will acknowledge Sir Keir's success in holding Boris Johnson to account over the Covid crisis but will add: 'It's not enough to chip away at Boris's blundering and the Tories' incompetence. We have to make people feel they're voting for something – not just against something.</p>

<p>MPs loyal to the former leader warned Sir Keir not to abandon Mr Corbyn's 'overwhelmingly popular' Left-wing agenda. (Above, Corbyn last December)</p>

<p>'It would be folly to ditch all the policy platform built up over the last five years. Build on it, yes! But don't jettison the core principles.'</p>

<p>Insisting Mr Corbyn's policies were popular with both the party membership and the electorate, Mr Trickett writes: 'The last thing we need in the age of Covid, when even the Tories see the sense of massive state intervention, is for Labour to lurch to the Right.' </p>

<p>Sources loyal to Sir Keir hit back last night by pointing out that only this weekend a YouGov poll showed Labour had now drawn level with the Tories on 40 per cent each.</p>

<p>One said: 'It's pretty ridiculous for the hard-Left to start whingeing about Keir, given how much progress he's made in restoring the party's reputation since our disastrous Election result under Corbyn.'</p>

<p>Separately, Labour officials also protested at Mr Corbyn's decision to take part in virtual pre-conference meetings yesterday, saying he should be keeping a low profile.</p>

<p>One said: 'At the same time Labour women's conference hears from black female MPs and members, Jeremy Corbyn is hosting a rival event that matters most to him – his ego.'</p>

<p>But last night, allies of the former leader insisted he had every right to take part in conference meetings and branded the criticisms 'absurd'. </p>
