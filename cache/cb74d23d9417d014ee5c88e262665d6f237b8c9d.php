<p>Police were called to Barnsley Hospital on May 16 after reports that the baby, Keira-Mae, had suffered catastrophic injuries.   </p>

<p>Doctors at the hospital switched off the baby girl's life support at 2.50pm on Monday, as she never recovered from her injuries. </p>

<p>South Yorkshire Police said Aimee and Alex Jones, who run a dog kennel business from their home in Barnsley, were released on police bail last night. </p>

<p>Aimee, 31, and Alex Jones, 38, from Atherley, Barnsley, who were arrested on suspicion of murdering their newborn daughter, have been released on police bail</p>

<p>Both parents were questioned by police over the circumstances surrounding their daughter's death.</p>

<p>A police spokesman said: 'We continue to appeal for information which could assist our inquiries.' </p>

<p>The Jones were caring for about 16 dogs in kennels in their back garden, according to their neighbours.</p>

<p>One said: 'My girlfriend spoke to Aimee a few times recently and Aimee was saying that doctors at the hospital wanted to turn off her daughter's life support machine because she was not very well. </p>

<p>'We never saw them bring the little girl home and don't know how she got injured.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'It is a horrible thing to happen and I feel so sorry for the little girl.'</p>

<p>In July Aimee posted on her Facebook page: 'Our baby girl Keira-Mae has been in intensive care since 16th May 2020. </p>

<p>'We were recently told to start making memories with her, and our minds were blank as to what kind of things we could do.'</p>

<p>South Yorkshire Police previously stated that a 31-year-old woman and a 38-year-old man, both from Athersley, were arrested on suspicion of murder and were in police custody for questioning by detectives.</p>

<p>Earlier, Detective Chief Inspector Phil Etheridge, the senior investigating officer, said: 'The injuries suffered by this little girl when she was just two days old were so catastrophic that she could not recover and her life support was withdrawn after four months.</p>

<p>Neighbours said the Jones (pictured), who run a dog kennel business from their home in South Yorkshire, were caring for about 16 dogs in kennels in their back garden</p>

<p>'Our thoughts are with those affected and our specialist officers are supporting them throughout this incredibly difficult time.</p>

<p>'We have a dedicated team of officers assigned to this investigation. Two people are in custody and we are working hard to establish the exact circumstances leading up to this child's death.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I know that the local community will be shocked and deeply saddened to hear of her death and it's important that people feel able to talk about their concerns but I urge everyone to be mindful of what they post on social media, and not to speculate on what may have occurred. </p>

<p>'If you have information that may assist, it's important that this is passed to the police to form part of the investigation.'</p>
