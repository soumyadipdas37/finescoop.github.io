<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Watford captain Troy Deeney has hit back strongly to claims he is difficult to work with by suggesting people can be uncomfortable that he 'speaks his mind'. </p>

<p>Deeney has become increasingly irritated by suggestions he is tough to be around and a bad trainer and both claims were debunked by the striker. </p>

<p>Speaking to the Sun, Deeney said: 'I have heard these stories going around. It's being said I'm a difficult individual and it's very frustrating, to be honest.  </p>

<p> Troy Deeney (right) has hit back at suggestions that he is 'difficult' to work with as a player</p>

<p>The Watford captain said that he speaks his mind but that does not make him 'difficult'</p>

<p>'I've never had an issue where somebody has publicly said "Troy's difficult to work with". These are things being said by people who don't know me. Maybe it's because I speak my mind and that's uncomfortable for people sometimes.</p>

<p>'Should you bend who you are to please others? I don't think that's the right way to go about things.'</p>

<p>Deeney was part of the Watford side that suffered relegation on the final day of the pandemic-interrupted 2019-20 Premier League season. </p>

<p> The 32-year-old striker also criticised whispers that he is a bad trainer for returning late</p>

<p>But the 32-year-old is generating interest from the top flight - namely West Brom - and with the new season approaching, Deeney was determined to debunk rumours of his behaviour. </p>

<p>He describes himself as a 'soldier' for the team due to his total commitment but did admit that if things were going wrong he would speak out. </p>

<p>In the run-in of their relegation season, Deeney was quizzed on an alleged fight at half-time in the dressing room in a match against West Ham. He was also asked whether he was having a say in team selection following the dismissal of Nigel Pearson. </p>

<p>Deeney denied both of those at the time and has since continued to put the record straight in a bid to ensure his reputation is not knocked by what he believes are inaccurate assessments of his character. </p>

<p>Due to family reasons, Deeney came back a week later than others in the Covid-19 pandemic</p>

<p>The striker scored 10 Premier League goals in an injury-ravaged campaign last season and yet he is confident that he can still cut it in the top flight, backing his body to hold up if he does secure a move away from Watford. </p>

<p>Watford appear open to selling the striker as they look to balance the books following their relegation.</p>

<p>Indeed, Deeney is one of a clutch of players who is not required to take a pay reduction following their relegation which increases the likelihood of the club listening to offers for the talismanic skipper.</p>
