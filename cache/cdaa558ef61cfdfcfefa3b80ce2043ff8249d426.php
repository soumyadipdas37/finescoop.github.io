<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A hospital in Massachusetts has found another job for Spot, Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot: Doctor.</p>

<p>The yellow-and-black quadruped has been proven able to take patients' vital signs from a distance of over six feet.</p>

<p>That could allow healthcare workers to keep a safe distance from patients who may be infected with the coronavirus or other contagion.</p>

<p>So far, Spot has only been tested on healthy patients at Harvard Medical School's Brigham and Women's Hospital - the next step would be to try it out in an emergency room setting. </p>

<p>Researchers at MIT say they've developed cameras that allow Spot, Boston Dynamics' dog-like robot, to take vital signs from more than six feet away. The VitalCam could allow health care workers to maintain social distancing while examining patients who may have COVID-19</p>

<p>The Boston hospital initially used Spot simply as a walking iPad: A tablet mounted on its 'face' allowed doctors to speak with patients approaching the hospital and triage those who needed immediate care.</p>

<p>The robot is operated from a distance using a handheld device, according to MIT News.  </p>

<p>But in a new report, researchers at MIT say they've proven Spot can measure pulse rate, temperature and other diagnostics from more than six-and-a-half-feet away. </p>

<p>To achieve this, they developed VitalCam, four different cameras mounted on Spot. </p>

<p>Spot's VitalCam incorporates four different cameras - an infrared camera that measures temperature and breathing rate, and three others that filter different wavelengths of light to gauge pulse and blood oxygen saturation</p>

<p>An infrared camera measures temperature and breathing rate, even through a mask, while three other cameras filter different wavelengths of light to gauge pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation. </p>

<p>Spot's abilities have only been tested on healthy subjects, but the team says its ready for real-world application. </p>

<p>If it meets with FDA approval, the VitalCam could save time, resources and possibly even lives. </p>

<p>'In robotics, one of our goals is to use automation and robotic technology to remove people from dangerous jobs,' Henwei Huang, an MIT graduate student working on the project, said in a statement. </p>

<p>'We thought it should be possible for us to use a robot to remove the health care worker from the risk of directly exposing themselves to the patient.'</p>

<p>An operator uses a handheld device to operate Spot through a hospital corridor. 'We thought it should be possible for us to use a robot to remove the health care worker from the risk of directly exposing themselves to the patient.' said MIT researcher Henwei Huang</p>

<p>Spot's testing capabilities have only been tried on healthy subjects. The next step would be to test it out in an emergency room setting with patients who may have COVID-19</p>

<p>Eventually Spot could be used to let doctors continue to monitor patients without going into their rooms.</p>

<p>Funded by the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering, the study was posted on the preprint server techRxiv, but has not been published yet in a peer-reviewed medical or scientific journal.</p>

<p>'We are thrilled to have forged this industry-academia partnership in which scientists with engineering and robotics expertise worked with clinical teams at the hospital to bring sophisticated technologies to the bedside,' said senior author Giovanni Traverso, a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT and a gastroenterologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital.</p>

<p>Spot has become increasingly useful during the pandemic: The robotic rover has also been deployed in Singapore, where it's used to ensure visits to a local park keep six feet apart during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Spot patrols a 4-mile swath of Singapore's Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park during off-peak hours, playing a recorded message reminding listeners to 'observe safe distancing measures'</p>

<p>According to the National Parks Board, Spot patrols a four-mile swath of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park during off-peak hours, playing a recorded message reminding listeners to 'observe safe distancing measures.'</p>

<p>An attached camera helps estimate the number of people in the park, though officials say it won't record individuals or track personal information.</p>

<p>After making a limited number of Spots available last fall, Boston Dynamics rolled out the quadruped robot for sale commercially in June, with a price tag of $74,500.  </p>
