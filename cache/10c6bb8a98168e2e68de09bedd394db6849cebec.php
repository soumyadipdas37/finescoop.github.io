<p>That doesn't add up! The Bachelor suffered an awkward editing fail on Wednesday night's episode while introducing intruder Bec Cvilikas (pictured) to Locky Gilbert over Zoom</p>

<p>Wearing a grey long-sleeve shirt, Bec was all smiles as she struck up a conversation with Locky over the video-sharing app during the 'Love In Lockdown' episode.</p>

<p>When asked to divulge more information about herself, she began: 'Ok. Well, I'm 25. I've lived on the Sunshine Coast pretty much nearly my whole life, and I played Rugby League as well for four years.'</p>

<p>However, just a few seconds later in a piece-to-camera, Bec is shown wearing an orange dress with a caption that read: 'Bec, 24, Senior Beauty Consultant.'</p>

<p>Bec's 25th birthday occurred in January, so by the time of filming her Zoom meeting with Locky she had been 25 for a couple of months.</p>

<p>Her correct age is displayed on Channel 10's Bachelor website.</p>

<p>Did YOU spot the error? Just a few seconds after telling Locky she was 25, Bec's Bachelor bio claimed she was 24. Her 25th birthday was in January, months before her Zoom date</p>

<p>Not happy: The remaining girls admitted they felt threatened by Bec's presence, and Roxi Kenny (pictured) insinuated that she believed the blonde wasn't there for genuine reasons</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bec's arrival generated plenty of drama among the cast. </p>

<p>The remaining girls admitted they felt threatened by her presence, and Roxi Kenny even insinuated that she wasn't there for genuine reasons. </p>

<p>Some of the show's devoted viewers also complained that it was too late into the series to introduce a new lady into the mix.</p>

<p>Coming up roses! Former Survivor hunk Locky chose to keep Bec as one of the remaining nine ladies to continue the show at the Bachelor mansion in Sydney</p>
