<p>The 57-year-old TV host has a segment on his celebrity chat show, The Graham Norton Show, where everyday people are invited to tell stories.</p>

<p>They have only seconds to capture his attention, and if he's not enjoying the story, he pulls a lever, which flips their chair and subsequently ends their tale.</p>

<p>True story: Graham Norton delivered a brutally honest answer when asked if he's ever regretted pulling the lever on someone sitting in his famous Big Red Chair on The Project</p>

<p>But after being asked by The Project's Waleed Aly if he's ever 'regretted' pulling the lever, Graham confessed he's not invested enough to even care.</p>

<p>'I mean, it's somebody telling a story. Who really cares?! Who cares?!' he laughed.</p>

<p>His blunt response prompted a stunned Carrie Bickmore to brand the veteran TV star 'so tough'.</p>

<p>Ouch: After being asked by The Project's Waleed Aly if he's ever 'regretted' pulling the lever, Graham confessed he's not invested enough to even care</p>

<p>But Graham confessed there have been times where he's momentarily thought he would've liked to hear the end of the story.</p>

<p>Still, he insisted that '99.9 per cent' of the time, pulling the lever was the right decision, despite often facing criticism from the celebrities on his show.  </p>

<p>'Sometimes the guests insist that people come back and I would say 99.9 per cent of times, they regret that decision, because I was right!' he continued. </p>

<p>Standing by his decision: He insisted that '99.9 per cent' of the time, pulling the lever was the right decision, despite often facing criticism from the celebrities on his show</p>

<p>'It was going nowhere! You thought it was going somewhere - it wasn't.' </p>

<p>After taking a break from filming amid the coronavirus pandemic, it was revealed The Graham Norton Show would be returning to air next month.</p>

<p>Celebrity guests will now either dial in via video call, or will be positioned around the studio on socially distanced chairs instead of the usual couch. </p>

<p>'Sometimes the guests insist that people come back and I would say 99.9 per cent of times, they regret that decision, because I was right!' he continued</p>
