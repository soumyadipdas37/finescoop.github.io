<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The International Space Station was forced to make an emergency manoeuvre to avoid hitting a piece of a 2018 Japanese rocket, NASA confirmed. </p>

<p>Russian and US-based flight controllers on Earth worked together during a two-and-a-half minutes operation to adjust the station's orbit to avoid the collision. </p>

<p>Astronauts on the ISS - two Russians and an American - relocated to another area of the station to be near the Soyuz capsule in case evacuation was necessary.</p>

<p>The astronauts were able to return to their normal activities after the procedure, and the piece of debris passed within about a mile of the station.</p>

<p>The International Space Station - seen here on August 26, 2020 - performed a manoeuvre on September 22, 2020 to ensure it gets out of the way of a piece of space debris</p>

<p>The scrap was actually a piece of a 2018 Japanese rocket, astronomer Jonathan McDowell said on Twitter. The rocket broke up into 77 different pieces last year. </p>

<p>'Manoeuvre Burn complete. The astronauts are coming out of safe haven,' NASA chief Jim Bridenstine said on Twitter after the event.</p>

<p>Bridenstine joined calls for better management of space junk in the future.  </p>

<p>The ISS usually orbits 260 miles above the Earth, at a speed of about 17,000 miles per hour and at that velocity even a small object could cause serious damage.</p>

<p>The type of manoeuvre carried out to avoid the Japanese rocket fragment necessary on a regular basis due to the number of pieces of debris surrounding Earth. </p>

<p>NASA said 25 such manoeuvres had occurred between 1999 and 2018 but so far in 2020 there have already been three, according to Bridenstine.  </p>

<p>The operations could become even more frequent as Earth's orbit becomes littered with pieces of satellites, rockets and other objects launched into space.</p>

<p>Accidental or deliberate collisions, including anti-satellite missile launches by India in 2019 and China in 2007, can break objects apart even further. </p>

<p>It is believed there are around 160million pieces of debris floating around Earth, trapped in our planet's gravity and travelling at 18,000mph.</p>

<p>Accidental or deliberate collisions, including anti-satellite missile launches by India in 2019 and China in 2007, can break objects apart even further</p>

<p>Of these, almost one million are believed to be larger than 0.4inches. If one of these were to collide with a satellite the damage would be devastating. </p>

<p>'Debris is getting worse! Time for Congress to provide <?php echo e('@'); ?>CommerceGov with the $15 mil requested by <?php echo e('@'); ?>POTUS for the Office of Space Commerce,' Bridenstine tweeted.</p>

<p>The Office of Space Commerce is a civilian organisation that supporters want to take over the surveillance of space junk, a job currently occupied by the military.</p>

<p>Astronomers are concerned that high-value craft in low-Earth orbit, such as the International Space Station (ISS), could be destroyed by a rogue piece of debris. </p>

<p>Currently, there is no way of accurately monitoring and tracking small pieces of debris which could be hurtling towards a multi-million pound satellite.</p>

<p>There are an estimated 170 million pieces of so-called 'space junk' - left behind after missions that can be as big as spent rocket stages or as small as paint flakes - in orbit alongside some US$700 billion (£555bn) of space infrastructure.</p>

<p>But only 22,000 are tracked, and with the fragments able to travel at speeds above 16,777 mph (27,000kmh), even tiny pieces could seriously damage or destroy satellites.</p>

<p>However, traditional gripping methods don't work in space, as suction cups do not function in a vacuum and temperatures are too cold for substances like tape and glue.</p>

<p>Grippers based around magnets are useless because most of the debris in orbit around Earth is not magnetic.</p>

<p>Around 500,000 pieces of human-made debris (artist's impression) currently orbit our planet, made up of disused satellites, bits of spacecraft and spent rockets</p>

<p>Most proposed solutions, including debris harpoons, either require or cause forceful interaction with the debris, which could push those objects in unintended, unpredictable directions.</p>

<p>Scientists point to two events that have badly worsened the problem of space junk.</p>

<p>The first was in February 2009, when an Iridium telecoms satellite and Kosmos-2251, a Russian military satellite, accidentally collided.</p>

<p>The second was in January 2007, when China tested an anti-satellite weapon on an old Fengyun weather satellite.</p>

<p>Experts also pointed to two sites that have become worryingly cluttered.</p>

<p>One is low Earth orbit which is used by satnav satellites, the ISS, China's manned missions and the Hubble telescope, among others.</p>

<p>The other is in geostationary orbit, and is used by communications, weather and surveillance satellites that must maintain a fixed position relative to Earth. </p>
