<p>Anne found out she has stage three breast cancer in April, 20 years after she was first diagnosed with the disease in 2000.</p>

<p>Her sister Linda discovered she had incurable liver cancer days later. </p>

<p>The pop star has also battled cancer before. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, cellulitis and lymphoedema in her arm in 2007 and secondary cancer on her pelvis in 2017.</p>

<p>Linda, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, is due to have an MRI scan. </p>

<p>Discussing her experience in August, Linda admitted that she was 'traumatised' by losing her hair during treatment as she detailed the side effects.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've got certain side effects from the chemo. I've got pins and needles in my fingers and my toes.  </p>

<p>'But it hasn't been too bad. I think for me personally I was traumatised losing my hair.</p>

<p>Close: Anne, who finished her chemotherapy treatment in August, was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer in March and her sister Linda found out she had incurable liver cancer just a few days later</p>

<p>'At the time you feel like you're being a little bit vain but I think everybody takes it differently. </p>

<p>'For a woman losing your hair is a really traumatic thing. We're not supposed to be going around bald.'</p>

<p>Explaining how her sister Anne was coping, Linda said: 'Anne has really had it tough because her body isn't handling the chemo so well.'</p>

<p>'But we're getting there, you know. She's got Maureen, our sister, to look after her. And I moved into my sister Denise's house so she could look after me. </p>

<p>Candid: Discussing her experience, Linda admitted that she was 'traumatised' by losing her hair during treatment as she detailed the side effects</p>

<p>'It's difficult, we're all devastated. We're both scared to death because we don't want to die.</p>

<p>'But we're doing the best we can and reiterating to everyone to go to hospital and get sorted. Because you will eventually have to get sorted and it might be too late.'  </p>

<p>Linda also revealed that it has been emotional looking in the mirror as it reminds her of her late sister Bernie, who tragically passed away from cancer in 2013.  </p>

<p>She said: 'We miss Bernie every single day. I don't think we'll ever get over it. The first time I looked in the mirror when I had my head shaved, I saw Bernie looking back at me.'</p>
