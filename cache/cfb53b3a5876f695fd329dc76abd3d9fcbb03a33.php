<p>'I want a good-looking little basketball player. I do like a basketball player and I want my family. I want a few kids maybe one or two I want a little dog.' </p>

<p>Malin was last in a relationship with Tom and the couple welcomed daughter Consy in December 2019, who tragically passed away. </p>

<p>Justice: The couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship, and earlier this month, Tom was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises (pictured in February 2019)</p>

<p>The couple split in 2019 after a violent relationship, and earlier this month, Tom was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court after leaving Malin with broken bones and bruises in a violent tirade.</p>

<p>He was jailed for ten months after admitting the attack, which broke Malin's hand, despite previously branding her 'a liar'.</p>

<p>The TV star accused 'narcissistic' Tom of being abusive in a series of Instagram posts last year.</p>

<p>But Tom, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, denied the claims at the time.    </p>

<p>Back in the dating game: 'I have recently started going on dates again which I haven't done for over a year. So I am looking for love - how about that?' </p>

<p>Their baby daughter Consy was born seven weeks premature in December 2018 and was being treated at Great Ormond Street hospital, but sadly passed away aged four weeks on 22 January, 2019.</p>

<p>Malin has spoken candidly about her grief and also works as a carer, after returning to the job as she felt a 'void' while away from the sector. </p>

<p>Speaking about lockdown, she told MailOnline: 'I kept myself busy - I was volunteering with the caring work, I was doing mental health lives everyday on my Instagram.' </p>

<p>'Living alone was fine by me I think it gave me a good time to do a lot more work on myself so I think I benefitted from it.'</p>
