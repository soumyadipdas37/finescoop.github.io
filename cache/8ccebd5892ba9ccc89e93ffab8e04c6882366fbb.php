<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tesco has removed a children's doll from its shelves after parents complained and a father slammed the 'sexualised' toy dressed in red lacy underwear and suspenders. </p>

<p>Adam Weaver, from Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, was left horrified after his seven-year-old daughter Savannah unwrapped her Na! Na! Na! Surprise doll and found it dressed in provocative underwear.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old shared photos on social media on Saturday showing the comparison between the £23 doll advertised on the box and the 'disturbing' toy inside.</p>

<p>After seeing his post, the supermarket said it would remove the product.</p>

<p>'We will be removing this product from our stores,' a spokesman said in a statement. 'We’d like to thank our customer for bringing this to our attention and are sorry for any offence that may have been caused.' </p>

<p>A father slammed the Na! Na! Na! Surprise doll for being different to its packaging</p>

<p>When his seven-year-old girl unwrapped the toy she found it was dressed in red lacy suspenders and underwear. He said he was horrified</p>

<p>Tesco has said it will remove the toy from its shelves after the product provoked anger from parents on social media</p>

<p>Telecommunications team leader Adam took to Facebook to warn other parents about the shocking discovery.</p>

<p>He posted the images saying: 'Anyone that knows me knows i’m not a prude or someone who is overly sensitive.</p>

<p>'Me and Sarah went to Tesco today and Sarah decided to get Sav a little treat to end the summer holidays.</p>

<p>'She wanted an LoL doll but after all the recent controversies, I opted for the below toy at £23 (not cheap for a doll) got it home to find out what doll she got and i”ll be honest I’m f***** disgusted.</p>

<p>'My daughter is 7 years old. When I was 7, action man had a pair of tighty whiteys.</p>

<p>'I don’t post a lot but feel free to have a little share if you think this s*** is wrong for kids.'</p>

<p>Tesco said the toy is made by MGA Entertainment and sold in several other retailers</p>

<p>Above is the box the toy comes in, which does not reveal how the doll is painted</p>

<p>Adams’ post sparked concern among other social media users.</p>

<p>One called on him to complain to Tesco, and a second said: 'I'm no snowflake, but this is beyond for even me.'</p>

<p>Adam said today: 'I'm a pretty chilled out guy but I was shocked by it. It seemed more of an adult style doll than something for young girls. </p>

<p>'My daughter thought she was just wearing a nice top so I bought her another toy to distract her and took it away so that she wasn't aware of my disgust or the true nature of it. </p>

<p>'She just seeing it as a nice top was part of my problem with it. As she is only seven she doesn’t see the seriousness of it and I don’t want her thinking clothes like that are normal everyday wear.'</p>

<p>Na! Na! Na! Surprise dolls are plush collectibles made by toy manufacturers, MGA Entertainment.</p>

<p>The company has recently received similar complaints regarding their LOL Surprise Dolls.</p>

<p>Furious parents claimed the dolls were also dressed in 'inappropriate' lingerie, which revealed itself only when the toys were dipped in ice cold water.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted manufacturer MGA Entertainment for comment.</p>
