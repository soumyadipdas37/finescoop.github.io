<p>The retailer's first drive-thru opened at the Manly Vale store in Sydney's northern beaches this week, with the service expected to roll out to more outlets across the country in the next 12 months. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Order online: Customer orders online and enters their licence plate number during check-out. An SMS and email sent to the customer, with instructions and ability to add/change plate number post-purchase.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrive at drive thru: As the customer arrives at the drive thru, cameras scan the number plate, match it with a pick-up order and alerts the team of the customer’s arrival.</p></li>
<li><p>Park: While the team identifies the order in the pick-up room, instructions and progress updates are communicated to customers in cars via digital screens mounted on the driver's side.</p></li>
<li><p>Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) check &amp; order received: Customer stays in the car, while the team member does an RSA check and places the order in the car boot. Digital screens recap the order for customers to check while their order is loaded.</p></li>

<p>'We are using technology to offer increasing convenience to customers, and the COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the demand for innovative e-commerce solutions,' Claire Smith, general manager of digital, said. </p>

<p>Customers are already losing their minds on social media over the new feature, with many describing it as 'an absolute game changer', while others insisted: 'My life is complete'.</p>

<p>'There is a God,' one woman said, while another added: 'Dreams do come true.'</p>

<p>Customers opting to use contactless pick-up saw an increase of 61 percent during FY20 according to stats from Endeavour Group, the parent company of Dan Murphy's and BWS.</p>

<p>More than 170 Dan Murphy's and BWS stores have rolled out contactless direct-to-boot service since April - initially as a response to the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>

<p>Direct-to-boot means customers simply place their order online, send an SMS when they arrive at the store, and a team member then puts their order in the car boot.</p>

<p>'Direct-to-boot service started as an idea to help customers and team members socially distance, but customers have responded to the convenience of it,' Ms Smith explained.</p>

<p>'So we are not only keeping the service indefinitely, but expanding the offering and making it even more convenient - like in the Manly Vale Dan Murphy's store case.'</p>

<p>The retailer's first drive-thru opened at the Manly Vale store in Sydney's northern beaches this week, with the service expected to roll out to more outlets across the country over 12 months</p>

<p>Endeavour Group's digital arm Endeavour X - which is led by Ms Smith - was launched in August 2019 to lead the digital transformation of customer and team experiences across the business, and it's safe to say it's been a busy first year.</p>

<p>'In the last six months, we have had to accelerate ecommerce capabilities for our retail brands including BWS and Dan Murphy's,' she said. </p>

<p>'COVID-19 has changed the ways our customers discover and shop not just in 2020, but for the foreseeable future, and as retailers, we have had to adapt and innovate to meet their needs.</p>

<p>'We changed the way we deliver due to Covid-19, and developed contactless delivery for our team and customers, with many customers opting for contactless delivery in order to maintain social distance.'</p>
