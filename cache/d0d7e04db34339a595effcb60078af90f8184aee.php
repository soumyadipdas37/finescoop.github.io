<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Married At First Sight couple Stacey Hampton and Michael Goonan recently rekindled their friendship.</p>

<p>But it appears the 28-year-old businessman hasn't quite got over his ex-'wife', as a source tells Daily Mail Australia he is secretly hoping they will reconcile.</p>

<p>'They're good friends now, but Michael wants her back,' the source said on Monday. </p>

<p>Claims Michael Goonan 'wants his ex girlfriend Stacey Hampton back' after her plans to relocate to Melbourne to 'start a family' with her new man were revealed. (Pictured together)</p>

<p>'Michael doesn't approve of her new relationship and is doing everything he can to try and get Stacey to visit him in the Gold Coast,' they added.</p>

<p>It comes just days after Daily Mail Australia revealed that Stacey was planning to relocate from Adelaide to Melbourne to pursue her new romance.</p>

<p>'Stacey's head over heels for her new man, and I have never seen her happier,' a source close to the mother of two said last week. </p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Monday, a source close to the couple has claimed Michael is hoping to reignite his romance with the 27-year-old blonde bombshell</p>

<p>'She's already started to pack her bags and she's ready to get on the first flight out once border restrictions are lifted,' they added.</p>

<p>Last week, Stacey and Michael proved they had put their differences aside by catching up for lunch in Adelaide.</p>

<p>Their friendly reunion came after Michael had made a public appeal on Instagram for her to give him another chance - as mates.</p>

<p>'Michael doesn't approve of her new relationship and is doing everything he can to try and get Stacey to visit him in the Gold Coast,' the source added</p>

<p>Earlier this month, he shared a throwback photo of the former couple in happier times and wrote: 'So publicly Stacey. Wanna be my friend again?'</p>

<p>The millionaire's plea to Stacey came after his break up with fellow Married At First Sight star KC Osborne in July.</p>

<p>KC blamed their break-up on Michael's unwillingness to change his 'playboy' ways. </p>

<p>Reminiscing:  Last Friday, Michael and Stacey first hinted that they've rekindled their friendship when Michael shared a video of the former couple in happier times</p>
