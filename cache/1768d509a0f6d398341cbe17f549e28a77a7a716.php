<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mason Greenwood has all the skill and calm personality to handle the iconic No.11 shirt at Manchester United, says its legendary former owner Ryan Giggs.</p>

<p>Old Trafford icon Giggs made the number famous in the red of United, and this summer the shirt has now been handed down to young teen prodigy Greenwood.</p>

<p>While the starlet has been making headlines for all the wrong reasons recently, following his escapades in Iceland with fellow youngster Phil Foden on international duty, Greenwood, 18, has been backed to knuckle down and get back to his best.</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood has been backed to make the No.11 his own by the shirt's former owner</p>

<p>Ryan Giggs believes the 18-year-old can go on to rival his achievements with the Red Devils</p>

<p>Speaking this week about United's exciting talent taking his old shirt, Giggs feels there is no debate around the extraordinary talent Greenwood already brings to the table. </p>

<p>'He’s nearly already scored more goals than I did, so there’s no pressure in that respect,' Giggs told the Sun.</p>

<p>'But no, I don’t think he’ll feel the pressure of the number. </p>

<p>'He’s a brilliant player, who I don’t think he even looks like scoring every game — I think he’s going to score two every game, he’s that much of a threat.</p>

<p>Giggs made the No.11 shirt famous during his trophy-laden days at Old Trafford</p>

<p>'He’s been playing off the right — eventually, I think he will go as a centre-forward.</p>

<p>'But he needs to go again. Opposition will be aware of him and they’ll be trying to stop him.'</p>

<p>Greenwood is looking to win back the trust of manager Ole Gunnar Solskajer, who is said to have been highly disappointed by his young star being sent home early from international duty.</p>

<p>Greenwood, along with Foden, brought coronavirus isolation restrictions by inviting two Icelandic girls to the official team hotel following a recent UEFA Nations League clash.</p>

<p>Both players had just made their senior debuts for the Three Lions, though manager Gareth Southgate had no option but to dismiss each of them immediately. </p>

<p>Greenwood has now rejoined United training, as Solskjaer's side prepare to make a belated introduction to the new Premier League campaign.</p>

<p>The Red Devils were given an additional week off, following their Europa League commitments at the tail end of last season delayed season.</p>

<p>United start their league action next weekend, when they host Roy Hodgson's Crystal Palace at Old Trafford. </p>
