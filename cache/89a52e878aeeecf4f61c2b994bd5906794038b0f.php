<p>Spacey was asked during the podcast to reflect on the current coronavirus pandemic causing global and widespread devastation.  </p>

<p>The actor, who has not appeared in a professional movie or series since the accusations were made, said:  'I don't often like to tell people that I can relate to their situation because I think it undermines the experience that they may be having which is their own unique and very personal experience.' </p>

<p>Taking the air: Other than this outing, he has only been seen earlier in the summer in a park walking his dog</p>

<p>Spacey added: 'But in this instance I feel as though I can relate to what it feels like to have your world suddenly stop.</p>

<p>'And so while we may have found ourselves in similar situations, albeit for very different reasons and circumstances, I still believe that some of the emotional struggles are very much the same.</p>

<p>'And so I do have empathy for what it feels like to suddenly be told that you can't go back to work or that you might lose your job and that it's a situation that you have absolutely no control over.'   </p>

<p>Oh dear! Adding to the former House Of Cards actor's woes, a photo was released in July of him with Ghislaine Maxwell sitting on the Queen and Prince Philip 's Coronation thrones during a private Buckingham Palace tour organised by Prince Andrew</p>

<p>Bad to worse! A photo obtained by the Telegraph appeared to show the pair reclining in the thrones in 2002</p>
