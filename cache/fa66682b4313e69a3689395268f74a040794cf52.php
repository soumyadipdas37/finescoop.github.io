<p>Top bank bosses, Matt Comyn from the Commonwealth Bank, and Shayne Elliot from ANZ, told a parliamentary committee on Friday house prices will likely to fall about 10 per cent over the next year.</p>

<p>'Our base case scenario would see house prices falling somewhere in the order of 10 to 12 per cent,' Mr Comyn said.</p>

<p>'Clearly acknowledging there's a lot of different parts of the market, broadly regional areas and performing better than metropolitan areas.'</p>

<p>Those to feel the brunt of the fall are apartment owners relying on capital growth, Mr Comyn said.</p>

<p>ANZ is forecasting a similar drop in house prices for the financial year, around 10 to 15 per cent. </p>

<p>But the banking executives were hesitant to predict the entire housing market would suffer the same impact. </p>

<p>'What we expect is there will be a reduction in house prices … but Australia's not one market,' ANZ Chief Executive Shayne Elliot said.  </p>

<p>This is despite house prices showing positive growth in the past 12 months according to Corelogic figures, reported the Herald Sun.  </p>

<p>Homeowners being warned to brace for a massive fall in house prices as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the Australian economy</p>

<p>House prices rose 11.4 per cent in Hobart, 11 per cent in Sydney, 8.4 per cent in Darwin, 7.9 per cent in Canberra, 6.7 per cent in Adelaide, 6 per cent in Melbourne, 4.3 per cent in Brisbane, and 2.1 per cent in Perth.</p>

<p>Back in May the Commonwealth Bank of Australia predicted house prices would drop by up to 32 per cent by the end of 2022. </p>

<p>The median price of a house is $986,000 in Sydney, $782,000 in Melbourne, $716,000 in Canberra,$558,000 in Brisbane, $512,000 in Hobart, $476,000 in Darwin, $481,000 in Adelaide and 462,000 in Perth.</p>

<p>Apartment owners reliant on capital growth are likely to be hit hardest according to Matt Comyn from the Commonwealth Bank</p>

<p>Meanwhile, customers who deferred mortgage payments and personal loans will soon be asked to pay up.</p>

<p>Australians owe the Commonwealth Bank of Australia a total of $60billion dollars through the deferral of more than 250,000 loans.</p>

<p>While around 84,000 ANZ customers have postponed payments for their mortgages.</p>

<p>Customers will be forced to start paying up in September and October.  </p>

<p>The parliamentary inquiry will continue next Friday with the bosses of National Australia Bank and Westpac to make submissions.</p>
