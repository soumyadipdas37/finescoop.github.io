<p>Debonair, athletic and with a penchant for glamorous women, Charles Dance, 73, could easily pass for an older James Bond. Now he has revealed that he turned down the chance to play 007 and admitted: 'I would have f***** it up'</p>

<p>Dance was invited to an audition when Bond producers were seeking to replace Roger Moore. He is seen above in suave mode with Greta Scacchi in 1987 film White Mischief</p>

<p>But his agent advised him not to go, he told the Financial Times, adding: ‘She said, “I urge you not to do it. </p>

<p>"One, think how you’ll feel if you don’t get it and, two, I think it will limit your career.” ’</p>

<p>The actor, who had earlier played a baddie called Claus in the 1981 Bond film For Your Eyes Only, agreed, saying: ‘I think she was being kind. </p>

<p>'I had not nearly enough experience for something like that – and I would have f***** it up.’</p>

<p>However, his association with the secret agent did continue when he played Bond’s creator, Ian Fleming, in an ITV drama about the writer’s life in 1989.</p>
