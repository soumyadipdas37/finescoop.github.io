<p>Last month, Fleur discussed with MailOnline why lockdown put everything into 'perspective' for her following the loss of her father earlier this year. </p>

<p>With the lockdown restrictions beginning to ease, the singer reflected on the several months she spent at home with her husband and loved ones, adding that the loss of her beloved dad Malcom at the start of lockdown, coupled with the pandemic has made her see things differently.</p>

<p>She explained: 'I appreciate things more. One, because of the pandemic but also for me on a personal level as I lost my dad just before lockdown.'</p>

<p>Fleur, whose mother Irene lived with her and husband Marcel Badiane-Robin at the start of lockdown, continued: 'It was like, at the moment that I could have my family around me, it meant so much more to me for that reason.</p>

<p>Great team: Fleur added, 'It's by far the toughest thing I've ever done and couldn't have done it without the amazing people I shared this journey with'</p>

<p>'Thinking of all the things we usually moan about and then having everything put into perspective for me, right at the start of lockdown, definitely gave it a different meaning for me and placed a lot more importance on cherishing your loved ones.'</p>

<p>'It's interesting because before I was like, "I'll take it as it comes, I'm not in a rush, we've got time"', she explained. 'But as soon as you lose someone, you're like 'Wow OK, you can't really plan for anything, nothing's promised.</p>

<p>'So it's changed my views on that definitely. I'm a bit more open to the idea of starting a family now.</p>

<p>'I'm still not planning it, but I'm not waiting and saying "I'll start in a year" or anything like that. We are just letting things happen naturally now!'</p>
