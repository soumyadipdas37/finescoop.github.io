<p>Dax and Kristen have been married since 2013 and are the proud parents of two daughters - Lincoln, seven, and Delta, five. </p>

<p>The Us Weekly insider stated: 'Dax chose to keep this a secret from Kristen because he felt so ashamed at the time and didn’t want to hurt her.'</p>

<p>Said the source: 'They have such a strong marriage and have always been there for each other through thick and through thin.'</p>

<p>The insider revealed: 'Eventually, he couldn’t hide it from her any longer and he had to come clean. She was nothing but supportive and there’s no blame or anger on her side - just love, care and determination to get through this together.'</p>

<p>Seeking recovery: And although he initially kept his relapse a 'secret' from Kristen an Us Weekly source said she was 'nothing but supportive' of him when he finally confessed</p>

<p>This source continued: 'Her heart aches for Dax after what he went through with his dad, and she’s beyond proud of him for turning his life around whilst openly addressing his demons head-on.'</p>

<p>Dax' father died of small cell carcinoma aged 62 in 2012 and his stepfather, with whom he was close, succumbed to prostate cancer in 2018. </p>

<p>He confirmed he had suffered a relapse last week, and recently thanked his fans for their kind messages following his confession. </p>

<p>Dax said: 'Just quickly, I want to say thanks to all the people that have been so unbelievably lovely to us in response to "Day 7." '</p>

<p>Happy couple: Dax and Kristen have been married since 2013 and are the proud parents of two daughters - Lincoln, seven, and Delta, five</p>

<p>The star shared: 'My fears were the opposite of what the result was, yeah. But yeah, struggling with some fraudulent feelings of receiving love based on a f***-up. But, at any rate, I am really, really grateful, and there's so many beautiful, nice people.'</p>

<p>When the CHiPS star opened up about his relapse, he also spoke about previous instances in which he had fallen off the wagon.</p>

<p>Eight years into his sobriety while his father was dying, the pair of them took prescription drugs together.</p>

<p>At that point Dax had recently suffered a motorcycle accident and so was permitted to take Vicodin but was meant to do so in a strictly controlled fashion whereby Kristen would 'dole out the prescription.'</p>

<p>'Hard and wonderful work of sobriety': On September 1 this year he got a card from one of his daughters for his '15th sobriety birthday'</p>

<p>He said of his father: 'You know, we had so little in common and so much f<strong><em>ing friction. But the number one thing we had in common was we were both f</em></strong>ing addicts and we had never used anything together.'</p>

<p>The Without A Paddle heartthrob recalled on occasion when 'we sat there stoned and looked at the lake. And in that moment, I felt elation and I was just happy ... I probably took twice [as much] of what my other prescription was.'</p>

<p>Eventually his prescription drug use reached the point where he decided to seek help and go on the wagon.</p>

<p>During his confession last week, Dax also revealed he was starting his sobriety over again, and was seven days clean as of September 21.</p>
