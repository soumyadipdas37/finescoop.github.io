<p>'Champs at multitasking': Hilaria Baldwin snapped a bathroom mirror selfie this Saturday while breastfeeding her newborn fifth child</p>

<p>Her post received some comments criticizing her for spending too much time on social media when she had a new baby at home.</p>

<p>'Good for you ... but TMI... use the focus on yourself and your children now,' read one, while another said: 'Seriously, get off social media and bond with your baby. Do you not get attention at home?'</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter Hilaria fired up her Instagram page again to post a lengthy message addressing the digs.</p>

<p>'Let me be really clear about something: I will post here and there about how we are doing. If you send me a comment telling me how much to post or how little, and I happen to see the message, I will just block you. I’m not interested in those opinions. 5 kids in, we are happy, healthy, bonded, tired, busy, but blessed,' she wrote. </p>

<p>Hilaria's response: Her post received some comments criticizing her for spending too much time on social media when she had a new baby at home so she posted a clapback</p>

<p>'The split second it takes to snap a pic or put it here, on our community that we have built for years, is something I enjoy. Remember it’s not just people I don’t know who follow here. Although I feel really connected to our online family,' she noted.</p>

<p>'It’s also my family and friends too and we all want to stay in touch. Especially now, during Covid, when this is how they will meet Edu. I look back to these pics and am always happy to pause and document. I never regret it.'</p>

<p>She concluded: 'When I see a negative comment, I always wonder…why do you follow me, if you don’t like what you see? Now, back to my family.'</p>

<p>Hilaria captioned the post: 'In case you missed my stories and you need clarity here too. As I said there: 45 seconds on this and that is all I’m giving it. Post from here will hopefully just be babies and silliness and love.'</p>

<p>'Yesterday, when we got home with Edu, after the intitial wildness of meeting him, we watched a movie of their choice. Two tired parents, all of our Baldwinitos together...hearts full,' she wrote in her caption. </p>

<p>Today we wake up to 9/11 and I think about my little New Yorkers, my little beings of this next generation,. We talk to them about the significance of today, in different ways to each, as they are different ages,' she shared.</p>

<p>'We remember, we mourn, and we honor. As their mother, I meditate on how I can raise them to make this planet more peaceful, more respected, and safer.'</p>
