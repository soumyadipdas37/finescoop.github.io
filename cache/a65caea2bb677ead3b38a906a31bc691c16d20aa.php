<p>South Australia was declared virus-free on by Premier Steven Marshall on Wednesday with no known active cases for the first time since July 21.</p>

<p>The state's last remaining case was a middle-aged nurse who volunteered to work in Melbourne's aged care home who has since recovered. </p>

<p>Tasmania is again free of coronavirus after a man in hospital recovered from the deadly virus.</p>

<p>He tested positive on August 11 while in the North West Regional Hospital after returning from Melbourne where he received medical treatment.</p>

<p>The state's health department confirmed the man, who was the island's only active COVID-19 case, had recovered as of Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Tasmania, which has had 228 cases overall, has recorded just two cases in more than three months.</p>

<p>It had a four-week stretch of being COVID-19 free across June and July.</p>

<p>Tasmania's borders will stay shut until at least December because of the risks posed by outbreaks on the mainland.</p>

<p>Premier Peter Gutwein recently extended the state of emergency until the end of October.</p>

<p>Thirteen people have died from the virus. </p>
