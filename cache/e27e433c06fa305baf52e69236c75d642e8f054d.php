<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eddie Hearn is one of most high-profile and well-connected men in boxing but it has not stopped fighters preparing to let punches rain as he opened up on one such incident with British heavyweight Dereck Chisora. </p>

<p>Appearing as a guest on popular Sky show A League of Their Own, Hearn explained that he 's*** himself' when an angry Chisora made a beeline to attack him.</p>

<p>Hearn revealed Chisora had come at him on multiple occasions but after one such incident he 'went over to him and asked him to calm down' before joking his voice went squeaky as he nervously tried to quash any aggravation.</p>

<p>Hearn (left) said he 's*** himself' when heavyweight Dereck Chisora (right) came at him</p>

<p>His role as a panellist on the show provided fascinating insight for boxing fans around the world on how he handles fighters and what he has been working on during the lockdown for the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Hearn confirmed to host Romesh Ranganathan that Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury have agreed a two fight deal in 2021 to unify the heavyweight division.  </p>

<p>'We had a bit of success (during lockdown) with AJ and Tyson Fury planning for 2021,' he explained. </p>

<p>Joshua and Fury have agreed to two fights in 2021 to battle for undisputed heavyweight status</p>

<p>Hearn disclosed that he had had 'a bit of success' in lockdown with those negotiations</p>

<p>'Both agreed to fight in 2021, two fights, no doubt you'll be on me for tickets! It's a big fight, undisputed heavyweight championship of the world.' </p>

<p>Freddie Flintoff, on the opposite team to Hearn for the episode, joked that he wants to be put down to fight whoever comes out on top in the two bouts. </p>

<p>The plan for the two British heavyweights to battle to be crowned the undisputed champion of the world hinges on them coming through fights this year unscathed.  </p>

<p>Joshua is set to face mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev before 2020 is out and Fury needs to defend his WBC title against Deontay Wilder in a trilogy fight.  </p>

<p>Hearn previously revealed that Joshua will 'steamroll' both Pulev and then Fury to unify the division. </p>

<p>Hearn, who manages Joshua, believes that he will 'steamroll' both Kubrat Pulev and Fury </p>

<p>'I actually messaged him and I said: "You're going to steamroll through these guys",' Hearn said. </p>

<p>'He just replied in capitals and said: "STEAMROLL!" I think he'd love to [stop Fury]. He knows that Fury is an outstanding fighter and it's going to be very difficult. </p>

<p>'But you can ask him for yourself, I believe he has bad intentions in those fights and I believe he expects to. I believe he will knock out Kubrat Pulev and Tyson Fury.'</p>

<p>Fury is unbeaten in his 31 fight career while Joshua avenged for the one loss on his record to Andy Ruiz Jr by winning back his belts in Saudi Arabia last year.  </p>

<p>A League of Their Own is on Thursdays at 9pm on Sky One and NOW TV </p>
