<p>However, Tommy Little looked utterly unrecognisable in a picture from his pre-fame days, which resurfaced on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Unrecognisable! Viewers know him as one of the regular guest hosts of Channel 10's The Project - but can YOU guess who it is?</p>

<p>Tommy added to his barely-there look with a construction cap while his boxers peeked out from beneath his low-slung trousers.</p>

<p>The image stunned his fans after it was shared on the Carrie and Tommy Radio show's Instagram platform.</p>

<p>Tommy's former look was even more unrecognisable given that his arms didn't sport the plethora of tattoos he has now.</p>

<p>A little different! The image is actually that of host Tommy Little, 35, who is known for his suited and booted appearances on The Project</p>

<p>The Project and its hosts managed to avoid the swinging axe last week as the broadcaster announced a dramatic 'restructuring' of its news division, with the likes of Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Natarsha Belling and Tim Bailey being made redundant.</p>

<p>But many furious viewers have said that the left-leaning current affairs show, hosted by Waleed Aly and Carrie Bickmore, should have been first on the chopping block.</p>

<p>Sigh of relief: Last month Tommy found out that his job at the Channel 10 show was safe after the network cut at least 25 jobs in response to the COVID-19 recession</p>
