<p>After Lola said mom had been warned, Kelly shot back: 'Oh lord. Honey. Do u what u want. Just know that I have a birthday also and an Instagram.'</p>

<p>Then dad Mark Consuelos popped into the conversation by saying, 'Lord.' </p>

<p>Little Lola: Over the weekend Kelly called Lola a 'powerhouse' and thanked her</p>

<p>'MOM', Apple hilariously commented.</p>

<p>Gwyneth was quick to respond to her teenager - and in the best way possible  - commenting three crying laughing emojis in response.</p>

<p>In the caption, Gwyneth thanked everyone for their birthday wishes while also plugging her lifestyle brand Goop.</p>

<p>'In nothing but my birthday suit today... thank you all so much for the birthday wishes and thank you to <?php echo e('@'); ?>goop 's insanely amazing brand new body butter for making me think I can still get my kit off. #goopgenes' she captioned the snap.  </p>

<p>While Mikayala Garay added: 'As a student at SUNY Morrisville studying equine science to one day become a vet, I take classes off-campus at nearby stables. I'll use this money to buy books and to save up for a car to get to and from my classes off-campus.'</p>
