<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the heart-stopping moment a careless thug sped past a police car while pulling a wheelie on the fast lane of the motorway.</p>

<p>Lee Embleton, 51, was filmed careering along the road at 100mph when he shot past an unmarked police car.</p>

<p>Officers were travelling on the A194 slip road at Follinsby Lane in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, when he and another rider overtook them.</p>

<p>On September 11, Embleton, of Durham, admitted dangerous driving at Newcastle Crown Court and will be sentenced on November 13. </p>

<p>Police had watched in horror as the reckless driver performed a wheelie while speeding in the fast lane of the carriageway at around 1.30pm on June 23, 2018.</p>

<p>The video shows the police vehicle merging on to the motorway as the bike flies past them on the right with the driver balancing on his back wheel. </p>

<p>Lee Embleton, 51, sped past an unmarked police car on the A194 slip road at Follinsby Lane in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear</p>

<p>Another bike follows close behind as officers pull into the fast lane and hit speeds of 96mph to try and catch the two motorists.  </p>

<p>The officers followed Embleton and pulled him over when he slowed down in heavy traffic. </p>

<p>He was slapped with an interim driving ban and an immediate forfeiture order was made for officers to seize the Yamaha bike.</p>

<p>Chief Inspector Sam Rennison, of Northumbria Police, said: 'We deal with dangerous driving cases on a regular basis but it beggars belief that somebody would act so stupidly and dangerously on the roads.</p>

<p>'The overwhelming majority of motorbike riders use the roads in a safe manner and respect their own safety as well as other motorists, but Embleton did not and must now deal with the consequences of his actions.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately for Embleton, he decided to carry out the ridiculous stunt right in front of an unmarked police car - and our officers were able to quickly stop him and report him for the offences.</p>

<p>Embleton admitted dangerous driving at Newcastle Crown Court on September 11 and will be sentenced on November 13 following his dangerous driving caught by police </p>

<p>'Not only did he put his own life in danger on the afternoon in question, but also every other road user.</p>

<p>'His actions could easily have had fatal consequences and I sincerely hope he realises the severity of his actions.  </p>

<p>'Our roads are not a racetrack, and it is abundantly clear that Embleton cannot be trusted to use them in a lawful and safe manner.'</p>
