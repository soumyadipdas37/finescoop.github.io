<p>The 25-year-old has also been the subject of a £30million bid from Paris Saint-Germain, and Arsenal are understood to recognise that any substantial fee will allow them to reinvest.</p>

<p>Leverkusen will attempt to push for European silverware next season and The Telegraph report the Bundesliga outfit may swoop for Bellerin to boost their chances.</p>

<p>Bayer Leverkusen have expressed surprise interest in signing Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin</p>

<p>Bellerin remains Arsenal's first-choice right back but could find himself leaving with the north London club still hoping to be active in the market.</p>

<p>He remains under contract until 2023 but Sportsmail have previously reported that he is open to taking up a new challenge.</p>

<p>The money raised from Kai Havertz's move to Chelsea this week will strengthen Leverkusen's hopes of signing an experienced right back, with Tottenham's Serge Aurier also on their radar. </p>

<p>Arsenal may offload Bellerin for a substantial fee to allow Mikel Arteta to reinvest in his squad</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain have offered £30million for the right back with talks expected to continue</p>

<p>Both Juventus and Champions League winners Bayern Munich are also thought to admire Bellerin, alongside Leverkusen, but PSG have made the first concrete approach.</p>

<p>The French giants have weighed up swooping for Bellerin for a number of seasons, and their initial package was worth £25m with a further £5m in add-ons. </p>

<p>Talks are expected to continue, however, with Arsenal holding out for a greater fee.</p>

<p>Bellerin moved to the Emirates from Barcelona's famed academy in 2011 and has since made 205 appearances across all competitions.   </p>
