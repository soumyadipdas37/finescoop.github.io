<p>Researchers from the University of Sussex observed the brain functions of 71 volunteers from the UK and France while they undertook a pain perception task. </p>

<p>Half of these people were classified as binge-drinkers - that is consuming the equivalent of 2 and a half pints of lager one in 30 days - and half were not. </p>

<p>People who binge-drink regularly showed greater signs of dysfunction in the area of their brains linked to empathy than those who don't regularly drink alcohol. </p>

<p>Binge-drinkers struggled more than those that don't binge-drink when trying to 'adopt the perspective of another person experiencing pain', the authors said. </p>

<p>Volunteers were shown a range of images (pictured) showing painful injuries to limbs and asked to either imagine it was happening to them or someone else</p>

<p>In the task participants were shown an image of a limb being injured, and had to image the body part was either theirs or that of another person.</p>

<p>Binge-drinking has a specific definition - it isn't just going out for a heavy night.</p>

<p>According to researchers it is defined as consuming more than 2.1oz (60g) of pure alcohol on at least on occasion in the past 30 days.</p>

<p>That is the equivalent to about three quarters of a bottle of wine, or 2½ pints of lager at least once a month.</p>

<p>About 30 per cent of all adults over 15 years of age who drink alcohol in UK and France meet the criteria for 'binge-drinker'. </p>

<p>Volunteers then had to state how much pain they thought was associated with the injury shown in the image. </p>

<p>'[Bing-drinkers] took more time to respond and the scans revealed that their brains had to work harder – to use more neural resources - to appreciate how intensely another person would feel pain,' the team wrote. </p>

<p>The study also revealed a more widespread dysfunction in the brain of binge-drinkers related to empathy than previously realised.</p>

<p>A visual area of the brain, which is involved in recognising body parts, showed unusually high levels of activation in the binge-drinkers. </p>

<p>This was not true in the non-binge drinkers who looked at the same images. </p>

<p>When the binge-drinkers were asked to imagine the injured body part in the picture as their own, their pain estimate was not different from that of their non-binge drinking counterparts.</p>

<p>The difference came when they tried to imagine the limb belonged to another. </p>

<p>Professor Theodora Duka from the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex has been studying the effects of excessive alcohol consumption for years.</p>

<p>Binge-drinking is defined as consuming more than 2.1oz (60g) of pure alcohol – equivalent to about three quarters of one bottle of wine, or 2½ pints of lager - on at least one occasion in the past 30 days, she said.</p>

<p>About 30 per cent of all adults over 15 years of age who drink alcohol in UK and France meet the criteria for 'binge-drinker'. </p>

<p>'I have built up a strong body of evidence about the widespread way in which binge-drinking is associated with brain dysfunction in areas supporting self-control and attention,' she explained. </p>

<p>The goal of this study was to find out whether binge-drinkers showed less empathy when compared to non-binge drinkers - and they found it to be true. </p>

<p>'Reduced empathy in binge drinkers may facilitate drinking as it can blunt the perception of suffering of self or others during a drinking session,' said Duka.</p>

<p>'A region of the brain called the Fusiform Body Area associated with recognition of body parts showed hyperactivity in binge-drinkers in a situation in which feelings of empathy are experienced.'</p>

<p>People who binge-drink regularly showed signs of dysfunction in the area of their brains linked to empathy than those who don't regularly drink alcohol. Stock image </p>

<p>Dr Charlotte Rae from the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex said the results were 'surprising'. </p>

<p>'Our data show that binge-drinkers need to work harder to feel empathy for other people in pain,' said Rae, adding 'they need to use more resources in terms of higher brain activity than non-binge drinkers.' </p>

<p>This means that in everyday life people who binge-drink may struggle to perceive the pain of others as easily as people who don't drink to excess.</p>

<p>'It’s not that binge drinkers feel less empathy – it’s just that they have to put more brain resource into being able to do so,' Rae explained.</p>

<p>'However, under certain circumstances when resources become limited, binge drinkers may struggle to engage in an empathic response to others.'  </p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal NeuroImage: Clinical. </p>
