<p>On Sunday's episode of Watch What Happens Live, Cohen asked Williams what she thought of Leakes' announcement that she's leaving the Bravo reality show.</p>

<p>Gossip queen Williams said: 'I believe that this is not a truth, Nene has quit the show several times and you'll have her back.</p>

<p>Not holding back: Nene Leakes appeared to launch a shocking attack at Wendy Williams and Andy Cohen on Monday after the TV hosts discussed her departure from Real Housewives of Atlanta</p>

<p>'Nene likes attention – dramatic attention – I don't know what Nene is going to be doing for money,' Williams told Andy when he asked her about Nene's exit on Sunday's Watch What Happens Live</p>

<p>'Nene likes attention – dramatic attention – I don't know what Nene is going to be doing for money, I'm not trying to count coins, but the housewives is that one thing that all the girls use to promote their stuff.</p>

<p>'And even though Nene is as famous as Bethenny [Frankel], she's been able to turn it into a multi-million dollar situation.'</p>

<p>Wendy added: 'And what are they gonna do? Is it gonna be like Gregg and Nene, are you going to give them another show? That's boring.</p>

<p>'Is it going to be Nene being a grandmother? That's boring. Nene and her own kids? That's boring. Nene trying to figure out Hollywood? That's boring.' </p>

<p>Shortly after WWHL aired, Leakes, while not directly naming Cohen or Williams, lashed out on Twitter, seemingly calling Williams a 'cocaine head' and Cohen a 'racist'.</p>

<p>Bye, queens! Leakes, 52, seemed to hit out at Williams and Cohen and their respective talk shows - but didn't name the hosts</p>

<p>Accusations: Leakes then seemed to take aim at Williams writing 'she on cocaine'</p>

<p>Threatening: Leakes then appeared to take aim at Cohen</p>

<p>Allegations: Nene appeared to hit out at Cohen - despite not naming him in the tweets</p>

<p>She began, 'Both are f their ratings are LOW! Bye QUEENS,'</p>

<p>In her next tweet she appeared to take aim at Williams, writing, 'She on cocaine so they should stop using her to talk! They both need my help with their poor ratings.'</p>

<p>Leakes then seemed to target her former boss, Cohen, 'Keep trying me sir and imma let the world know who you really are.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two also felt the need to defend her financial status, following Williams' comments, 'I will ALWAYS eat and eat good! Believe that. I have ALWAYS believed in multiple streams of income so the Leakes are good you ole cocaine head and you ole racist.</p>

<p>'No one knew you until YOU knew me. Remember I’m ICON. Don’t forget.' she continued.</p>

<p>Williams' has never shied away from talking about her past struggles with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction. In 2014 she told PEOPLE: 'Drugs were a demon I had to overcome.'</p>

<p>Last year she sought treatment at a sober facility and confessed on The Wendy Williams Show, 'You know I’ve had a struggle with cocaine in the past… I never went to a place to get treatment. There are people in your family, it might be you… I want you to know more of the story.'</p>

<p>Cohen has not previously been accused of racism and it's not clear what racist actions of behavior Leakes was referring to.  </p>

<p>Icon: The reality star then defended her financial status after Wendy questioned it</p>

<p>Open book: Williams has never shied away from talking about her past struggles with alcoholism and a cocaine addiction. She sought treatment at a sober living facility in 2019. The talk show host is pictured here in 2012</p>

<p>Manipulating: Leakes also made claims of racism and appeared to focus the attack on TV networks </p>

<p>Fighting talk: The reality star hinted at legal action as she wrote 'it's war' - seemingly against Bravo</p>

<p>In her next tweet, Leakes appeared to attack the network again, writing, 'They ALWAYS manipulating black women to say negative things about each other while they sit and enjoy us tearing each other down! Remember #BLM Remember #breonnataylor REMEMBER the most racist networks.'</p>

<p>Leakes finally tweeted that 'it's war' - seemingly against Bravo but she didn't mention them by name.</p>

<p>'They gone leave my name outta these shows. ITS WAR. The racist is the master manipulator! They using me for ratings like they have always done.'</p>

<p>Dailymail.com has reached out to reps for Andy Cohen, Bravo and Wendy Williams for comment. </p>

<p>Leakes appeared to be on good terms with Bravo and Andy Cohen when she first announced her exit from RHOA earlier this month, thanking Bravo for the memories in a video announcement. </p>

<p>Despite her allegations Leakes previously reflected on the importance of the show's diversity, saying 'I'm just so happy that I can say that I was part of a genre that opened up a door for Black ensemble reality shows to step up and be a part of what we all now love so much: reality TV.'</p>

<p>On Sunday night the Atlanta-based star continued her rant as she retweeted posts from fans that hit out at Williams for telling Cohen any spin-off show starring Nene would be 'boring.'</p>

<p>She also shared a post which raised the question of why she was offered fewer episodes than her counterparts on shows like Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Real Housewives of New York.</p>

<p>'We strictly talking the OG’s. I was the ONLY BLACK OG. My white counter parts were elevated and given full season episodes EVERY season.</p>

<p>Manipulator: The TV personality appeared to accuse the network of using her for ratings</p>

<p>Ask them: Leakes questioned why she was never offered the same amount of episodes as her white counterparts</p>

<p>Systemic racism: Leakes signed off hinting that there is more to reveal</p>

<p>'Each season i was given less &amp; less. Don’t ask me, <?php echo e('@'); ?> Andy and <?php echo e('@'); ?> Bravo and ask them why.</p>

<p>'So much you guys just don't know! I'm going to bed now! The systemic racism is greater than you will ever know.' she wrote in her final tweet of the night. </p>

<p>This all came after Nene revealed she made the 'difficult decision' to leave the cast of the Real Housewives Of Atlanta after 11 seasons. </p>

<p>Over the weekend she then alleged Bravo 'forced' her out of the hit reality series.</p>

<p>The allegation was made after a fan on Twitter asked if Leakes would be getting her own 'spin-off series' on the network.</p>

<p>'They don't think i deserve to work at all in any [capacity],' she replied, which prompted another fan to write: 'it sound like they forced you out!'</p>

<p>'They definitely did,' wrote Nene, affirming the fan's claim.</p>

<p>Hours later, Leakes tweeted a message to RHOA executive producer Andy Cohen, regarding his recent praise towards RHOBH star Teddi Mellencamp and a statement she issued following her own dismissal. </p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>Andy said he respected Teddi for telling the truth about her exit. Well i can’t wait to tell my truths i hope i get just as much respect,' she wrote. Nene has yet to receive a reply from Andy. </p>

<p>Drama: The Twitter rant came just days after Leakes alleged Bravo 'forced' her out of the hit reality series; Nene pictured in 2019</p>

<p>Allegation: The claim came after a fan on Twitter asked Leakes if she would be getting her own 'spin-off series' on the network</p>

<p>Correct: 'They don’t think i deserve to work at all in any [capacity],' she replied, which prompted another fan to write: 'it sound like they forced you out!'</p>

<p>Nene announced that she was done with the Real Housewives Of Atlanta in a YouTube video on September 17.</p>

<p>In the clip Leakes said that she decided she was done with the show after going through 'exhausting' and 'emotional negotiations with the network.</p>

<p>Leakes revealed her big news in a YouTube video titled: 'Listen Closely, I got something to tell you!'</p>

<p>After thanking fans for their support at the top, Nene opened up about her departure.</p>

<p>Direct: Hours later, Leakes tweeted a message to RHOA executive producer Andy Cohen, regarding his recent praise towards RHOBH star Teddi Mellencamp and a statement she issued following her own dismissal; Andy pictured in 2019</p>

<p>'There's been a lot of emotions on both sides. It's been hard and I have made a hard, difficult decision to not be part of Real Housewives Of Atlanta season 13,' she said. </p>

<p>'It wasn't an easy decision for me. It was hard,' the TV favorite went on. </p>

<p>Nene reflected on how important the show's diversity was saying: 'I'm just so happy that I can say that I was part of a genre that opened up a door for Black ensemble reality shows to step up and be a part of what we all now love so much: reality TV.'</p>

<p>Leakes' farewell was also full of gratitude, as the star said: 'I want to thank everybody that has looked up to me over the years. ...I want to thank Bravo for all the memories. ...Thank you to the cast for all of the memories.'</p>

<p>Andy Cohen was quick to send Nene his love after the announcement, calling her 'an icon of the genre.' </p>

<p>Au revoir! Leakes announced on September 17 that she was leaving The Real Housewives Of Atlanta after 'exhausting' negotiations with Bravo</p>

<p>Groundbreaking: Nene reflected on how important the show's diversity was saying: 'I'm just so happy that I can say that I was part of a genre that opened up a door for Black ensemble reality shows to step up and be a part of what we all now love so much: reality TV'</p>

<p>'She is a gif and catchphrase machine,' Cohen, the show's executive producer, went on. 'In 11 years of #WWHL, Nene has been our most frequent guest, and she is always A BLAST. </p>

<p>'Nene nicknamed me “Buttercup” the first day we met, and still calls me that today. Through her whole run, she has always had a serious concern and drive to maintain the success and well-being of #RHOA. </p>

<p>'I am going to miss Nene on the show, but I’m hoping we work together again soon and will,' he wrote before signing off as Buttercup.</p>

<p>Shortly after Andy's message, a representative for Bravo called the star 'instrumental' to the show's success.</p>

<p>'We wish Nene all the best in her future endeavors and thank her for sharing her journey for over a decade with the fans of The Real Housewives of Atlanta,' they told People. </p>

<p>Iconic: Andy Cohen was quick to send Nene his love after the announcement, calling her 'an icon of the genre'</p>

<p>Close: He shared several shots of Leakes during visits to Watch What Happened Live, dubbing her his 'most frequent guest'</p>

<p>And they didn't discount the idea of her returning in the future, going on to say: 'She's been instrumental since the start and will truly be missed, and maybe one day she'll hold the peach again.'</p>

<p>This isn't the first time the reality star has parted with the show.</p>

<p>In season eight she took a step back as only a part-time 'guest' before going on to skip season nine completely.</p>

<p>In between Nene enjoyed a number of TV roles, appearing on Glee, The New Normal, and E!’s Fashion Police.</p>

<p>But it seemed Bravo couldn't keep Nene from the Hollywood Of The South for long. </p>

<p>She returned to RHOA during the 10th season and has been on the show since. </p>

<p>While there were rumblings that Leakes was ready to leave - or even canned from the show - over the summer, her manager Steven Grossman said she was still in talks over her contract on June 18th.</p>

<p>'It is absolutely not true that Nene has been fired from RHOA,' Grossman said. 'Furthermore, it was made abundantly clear prior that she will always be welcome on the series as long as she wants to be.'</p>

<p>He assured people things were in motion, telling the outlet they were 'having on-going bigger picture conversations with NBC Universal and have not made any decisions regarding next season specifically. Any speculation or sources trying to create controversy by stating otherwise are incredibly inaccurate. Bloop.'</p>

<p>Always a possibility! Nene has left the show before. In season eight she took a step back as only a part-time 'guest' before going on to skip season nine completely</p>

<p>But just the day before that Leakes posted a since-deleted tweet (captured by LoveBScott) which said: 'You are NOT gonna get away with this! I promise.'</p>

<p>She continued to hint at the idea of leaving that same day, retweeting a fan who declared: 'I wouldn't watch RHOA without Mrs. <?php echo e('@'); ?>NeNeLeakes she is what keeps me watching the show, she cracks me up!'</p>

<p>As an anchor of The Real Housewives, Nene has always been a magnet for drama.</p>

<p>This last season she feuded with a majority of the cast, finding herself at odds with Cynthia Bailey, Porsha Williams, Eva Marcille, Kandi Burruss and rival Kenya Moore. </p>

<p>Shrinking cast: Leakes isn't the only one saying goodbye to the show. In June Eva Marcille revealed she was done after a three season stint</p>
