<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sherlock Holmes and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's universe are among the best known in literary history. </p>

<p>But the classic characters are set to be given a decidedly modern and mischievous twist in new Netflix film Enola Holmes, which tells the story of the detective's teenage sister. </p>

<p>The film, which will arrive on the streaming service next week, promises a 'Fleabag-like' edge, with star Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Enola, turning to camera to directly address the audience.</p>

<p>The playful, fourth-wall-breaking approach is unsurprising given director Harry Bradbeer directed Phoebe Waller-Bridge's smash-hit TV show, as well as Killing Eve.</p>

<p>Classic characters are set to be given a decidedly modern and mischievous twist in new Netflix film Enola Holmes, which tells the story of the detective's teenage sister. Pictured, Millie Bobby Brown, Henry Cavill (left) and Sam Clafin (centre) as Enola, Sherlock and Mycroft Holmes</p>

<p>The trailer, released last month, has been enough to impress fans, who have taken to Twitter to say they are 'resubscribing to Netflix' just to make sure they're among the first to watch it</p>

<p>The star power continues in front of the camera, with Henry Cavill taking on the role of Sherlock, Sam Claflin as sinister Mycroft and Helena Bonham-Carter playing their mother, Eudoria Holmes. </p>

<p>Killing Eve alumna Fiona Shaw makes an appearance as Enola's headmistress.</p>

<p>Adapted from the first installment in a six-book young adult series by Nancy Springer, 'Enola Holmes' modernizes the Victorian world of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.</p>

<p>The story centres around Enola after she sets off to find Eudoria. She becomes a super-sleuth in her own right as she outwits her older brothers and unravels a dangerous conspiracy around a mysterious young Lord. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Times, Bonham Carter said: 'It's a good bit of old-fashioned and also not-so-old-fashioned fun. It's very consistent tonally — it's all got a wink.' </p>

<p>The film, which will arrive on the streaming service next week, promises a 'Fleabag-like' edge, with star Millie Bobby Brown, who plays Enola, turning to camera to address the audience</p>

<p>This interaction between actor and audience is part of what's led to the comparisons to Fleabag. Pictured, Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the hit show</p>

<p>Adeel Akhtar, best known for Four Lions, plays Inspector Lestrade. He said of the film: 'It’s steeped in the tradition of the books, but there’s this other element to it which is a little mischievous. That gave me a bit of freedom. It’s working out where you can be a step ahead of the audience.'</p>

<p>This interaction between actor and audience is part of what's led to the comparisons to Fleabag.   </p>

<p>'Harry Bradbeer brings a similarly breezy, direct-address approach to the material,' noted Reuters' Peter Debruge.</p>

<p>'A socially awkward character who's not the slightest bit uncomfortable on camera, Enola serves as her own narrator, frequently breaking the fourth wall as she speaks to the audience or shoots knowing looks in our direction - a style obviously modeled after the confidential "just between us" tone Bradbeer and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge struck in "Fleabag".</p>

<p>Change: Millie Bobby Brown, 16, has revealed that she struggled to do a British accent in her new role Enola Holmes after five years in the American Netflix series Stranger Things</p>

<p>'Enola Holmes offers a different kind of feminism from that game-changing show, based less in accepting women with all their flaws than in the conviction that men have bossed around long enough, and it's time to make room for other people.' </p>

<p>The trailer, released last month, has been enough to impress fans, who have taken to Twitter to say they are 'resubscribing to Netflix' just to ensure they are among the first to see it on screen. </p>

<p>One tweeted: 'Did i hear that right? enola holmes starring millie bobby brown, superman henry cavill and helena bonham carter? Oh my god.' </p>

<p>Fans are eagerly awaiting the arrival of Enola Holmes on Netflix next week</p>

<p>Another posted: 'My life is counting down the days until Enola Holmes comes out on Netflix.'</p>

<p>A third wrote: 'Watched the trailer of Enola Holmes for the 100th time!!!'</p>

<p>Speaking previously, Brown, 16, who shot to fame as Eleven in the hit Netflix show, revealed she 'found it really challenging being British' in the role of Enola. </p>

<p>Millie, who grew up in Dorset, England, and settled in Florida with her family to pursue her acting career aged eight, said she 'had to learn how to speak again'. </p>

<p>Speaking to Radio Times, she said: 'For the last five years I’ve been playing an American character in Stranger Things and I found it really challenging being British in this, even though I am a Brit. </p>

<p>'I had to learn how to speak again because I’m so used to speaking in an American accent.' </p>

<p>Enola Holmes arrives on Netflix September 23 </p>
