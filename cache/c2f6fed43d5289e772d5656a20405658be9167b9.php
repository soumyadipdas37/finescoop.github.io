<p>Appearing on This Morning today, they offered an update on their lives and revealed that while they still haven't heard from Jason Statham, Lillian has since received a proposal from a man called Desmond.</p>

<p>'No, I don't want him. I'd rather have Jason. I want an old man about 98, with about six months to live and a big fat cheque book,' she said, to which Doris added: 'As long as he's got time to put it into her name.' </p>
