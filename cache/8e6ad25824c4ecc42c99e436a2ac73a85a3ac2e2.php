<p>The assassins struck early on Sunday in a bar near to the town of Jaral del Progreso, in the central Mexican state of Guanajuato.</p>

<p>Local media claims that the four women found dead were local dancers at the bar which is located on the side of a highway.</p>

<p>No motive has been put forward for the shooting but the bar is in an area is near to the bordering state of Michoacán.</p>

<p>The town of Jaral del Progreso is an incursion point into Guanajuato for the Jalisco cartel who wants to expand to there.</p>

<p>The attack bore the signs of a drugs killing and Guanajuato has been the most violent Mexican state in recent years.</p>

<p>Guanajuato, a major carmaking hub, has become a recurring scene of criminal violence in Mexico, ravaged by a turf war between the local Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel.</p>

<p>The killing took place near the town of Jaral del Progreso in central Mexico</p>

<p>In July, gunmen killed 24 people at a drug rehabilitation center in Guanajuato, marking one of the worst mass slayings since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office pledging to reduce record levels of violence.</p>

<p>It was hoped that the arrest and detention of José Antonio Yépez Ortíz, the leader of the local Santa Rosa de Lima gang, on August 2 would help to stem the violence.</p>

<p>The drug kingpin, better known by his nickname El Marro (The Sledgehammer), had fought a long and bloody turf war against the Jalisco cartel.</p>

<p>The authorities blamed Ortiz for much of the violence which had taken place in the industrial and farming state. </p>

<p>José Antonio Yépez Ortíz, of the Santa Rosa de Lima gang, was arrested on August 2</p>

<p>This is the latest atrocity in Mexico this year which is gearing up to be the most violent and bloodiest year in the country on record.</p>

<p>There was an astonishing 117 murders recorded in just 24-hours on June 7 making it the most deadly day of the year so far.</p>

<p>It was run close by April 20 which had the previous high figure of 114 homicides. </p>

<p>Murders across the state of Guanajuato dropped slightly to 339 in August from 403 the month before.</p>

<p>There are fears that the figure will rise steeply through September as rival gang members seek to fill the vacuum left by Ortiz's jail sentence.</p>
