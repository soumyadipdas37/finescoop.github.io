<p>The Mooloolaba Yacht Club host the Christmas Boat Parade on the Queensland Sunshine Coast every year. </p>

<p>But Josh Close, event organiser, said they were forced to make the difficult decision to say goodbye to the event this year because of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The Mooloolaba Yacht Club, on the Queensland Sunshine Coast, has cancelled the 2020 Christmas Boat Parade</p>

<p>The event sees 30,000 people line the river bank to watch boats with incredible displays such as Santa's reindeer.</p>

<p>Homes along the river bank also put in a tremendous effort to create an atmosphere for the occasion. </p>

<p>'It's about the control of the spectator crowd,' Mr Close said.</p>

<p>'We don't have a lot of control over that.</p>

<p>'To be a COVID safe event we don't have the numbers and resources to manage people in the public areas that we would be required to do.'</p>

<p>The event is expected to go ahead in 2021 - with a date set for December 18.</p>

<p>The event sees 30,000 people line the river bank to watch boats with incredible displays - such as Santa's reindeer - and people dressed up as Santa sail by them</p>

<p>Josh Close, event organiser, said it was a difficult decision to say goodbye to the annual past time but said it needed to be done during COVID-19</p>

<p>'This this has not been an easy decision for Mooloolaba Yacht Club. We very much look forward to delivering once again a bigger and better parade in 2021,' Mr Close said. </p>

<p>Mr Close said he is looking for suggestions from the community about activities that can be held on the waterfront for the 2021 parade.  </p>

<p>'A lot of spectators get into place quite early and they get a bit edgy with nothing happening so something going past like some of the commercial boats with carolers or Santa, will keep the young ones entertained,' Mr Close said.</p>

<p>The event is expected to go ahead in 2021 - with a date set for December 18</p>
