<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A manhunt has been launched for a gunman who shot an 11-year-old girl in the face in suburban Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Police do not believe the child was the intended target nor do they think it was a random attack.</p>

<p>The girl opened the door after hearing a knock at the home on Fairland Avenue, Bethlehem, a short time before midnight on Wednesday.</p>

<p>She is expected to make a full recovery but was still undergoing surgery on Thursday night for severe facial trauma.</p>

<p>The girl opened the door after hearing a knock at the home on Fairland Avenue, Bethlehem, (pictured) a short time before midnight on Wednesday</p>

<p>Marcie Lightwood told The Morning Call her husband called 911 at 11.35pm after hearing a burst of five gunshots.</p>

<p>She said that by the time they went outside to investigate the block was filled with police cars.</p>

<p>Lightwood later went to drop flowers at the home, describing the victims of the attack as 'very nice people.'</p>

<p>'I'm just heartbroken for them,' Lightwood told Morning Call. 'It's just really, really sad.'</p>

<p>'I don't know how you can live with yourself,' she added. 'Disfiguring a young girl and terrorizing a neighborhood. Please turn yourself in.'Â </p>

<p>Another neighbour said that they overheard an argument the night before and were surprised that the attacker had even knocked.</p>

<p>Police believe the shooter may have been wearing a face mask and are urging anyone with information to contact them.</p>

<p>They've asked the residents of Bethlehem to remain 'extra vigilant' and to report 'any suspicious sightings.'</p>
