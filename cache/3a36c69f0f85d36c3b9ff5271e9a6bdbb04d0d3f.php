<p>Cake artist Michelle Wibowo, who created the sponge Mr Darcy, said she 'couldn't be happier' with the results.</p>

<p>'What better reason than the 25th anniversary of the series of Pride And Prejudice to create a birthday cake to celebrate,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Wibowo worked on the life-sized cake for more than 200 hours. </p>

<p>She started by sketching a model based on the 1995 TV adaptation, which will be re-broadcast as part of Jane Austen season on TV station Drama.</p>

<p>The cake itself contains 20kg of flour, 20kg of butter and 45kg of sugar.</p>

<p>'I've created cakes of everyone from the Queen to Beyonce, but Mr Darcy officially tops the list as the most delicious model I've ever made,' Ms Wibowo said.</p>

<p>'I hope his legions of fans will approve!'</p>

<p>Jane Austen season on Drama will air on Sundays, September 6-20.</p>
