<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian woman who claimed nothing could lift a yellow stain on her bathroom bench top or banish rust from her taps has found success with a little 'magic stone' she purchased on the internet.</p>

<p>The woman, who lives in New South Wales, bought the sell-out Universal Stone for $39.95 off Neat Inspiration and decided to share the unique find in the Mums Who Clean Facebook group.   </p>

<p>'Hey guys, thought I would post this product I have found in case it helps someone,' she said.</p>

<p>The woman, who lives in New South Wales, bought the sell-out Universal Stone for $39.95 off Neat Inspiration and decided to share the unique find on the Mums Who Clean Facebook group</p>

<p>'After trying every product I could find on supermarket shelves to get this stain out of my bathroom bench top and marks off the tap with no success, I decided to try this Universal Stone that I purchased online.</p>

<p>The Universal Stone is $39.95 online</p>

<p>'I even used it on the mirror which is now completely streak-free and shiny. These results are after minimal scrubbing. The price is a little up there but it cleans pretty much everything and it's a solid mass so it goes a long way.'</p>

<p>She shared photos of her bathroom cleaning success alongside the review, with all stains and markings completely disappeared in a matter of minutes. </p>

<p>'Wow it looks amazing! I have the same issue with my bathroom bench tops,' one woman commented. </p>

<p>'That looks so good. I think I need to invest in one,' said another.</p>

<p>Owners of the stone only need to rub the surface for it to foam with non-toxic soap, before scrubbing objects and appliances around the house with its non-abrasive outer layer.</p>

<p>It's made from six simple ingredients: Soapflakes, green soap, vegetable oils, glycerine, polishing clay earth and lemon essential oil. </p>

<p>Other reviews online have said it 'works when nothing else does' on stained microwaves and kitchen stove tops.</p>

<p>'This is so awesome to have around the house. I used it on my stainless steel fridge because it had fingerprints on it... I tried everything on it to get them off but this was all that worked,' one person said.</p>

<p>'This is the only thing I've found that works to clean shower doors. Excellent product,' said another.</p>

<p>While it's currently sold out on Neat Inspiration it can also be purchased on Amazon. </p>
