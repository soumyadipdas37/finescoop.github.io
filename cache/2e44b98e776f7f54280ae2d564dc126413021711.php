<p>After another arduous court situation where Gage attempted to receive 2-2-3 custody (two nights for Gage, two nights for Jeff and then switching off for three nights between each parent,) Jeff admitted to seeing 'some very noticeable changes in the last 30 days' with his daughter. </p>

<p>'I don't think Monroe going three nights without seeing him or three nights without seeing me is very good idea,' he said. 'Now, I don't know if he's paying attention at all to Monroe's behavior.</p>

<p>'We went from, uh, two nights a week with Gage to three nights ... she immediately became, and she's an independent child, very, very clingy to me, needy, uh, constantly asking me where I am, where am I coming back? Can I put her down to nap? Will I wake her up from nap? I'm not going anywhere, right. Can I watch you from the monitor?' </p>

<p>The Flipping Out star argued 'this is not my kid' with Monroe's recent behavioral changes. </p>

<p>'My kid doesn't act like this and she's been crying a lot,' he added. 'There's been a lot of tantrums and all of this. This could have, you know, this could have something to do with school as well, but I noticed that it was almost immediate once the third day was added.'</p>

<p>Monroe was actually expelled from her Montessori preschool last fall after Jeff criticized the school on his Radio Andy Show. </p>

<p>Work it out: Gage appeared to have taken his aggression out at the gym as he works out in new Instagram clips </p>

<p>'My kid doesn't act like this and she's been crying a lot,' he added. 'There's been a lot of tantrums and all of this. This could have, you know, this could have something to do with school as well, but I noticed that it was almost immediate once the third day was added.'</p>

<p>Then at her next school, Jeff claimed that his daughter was bullied by another toddler who pushed her down on the playground.</p>

<p>'And I'm now considering, um, uh, hiring a child psychologist to come in and maybe talk to her or observe her,' he said. 'Cause I'm concerned.' </p>

<p>Jeff and Gage welcomed their little girl into the world via surrogate on Oct. 25, 2016, a birth which saw its own legal battles after the woman who carried the child filed a lawsuit against the couple and Flipping Out‘s production company, Authentic Entertainment for unlawful recording, invasion of privacy and fraud.</p>

<p>The surrogate, Alexandra Trent, claimed the show had filmed her delivery without permission, but later dismissed all claims in 2018.</p>
