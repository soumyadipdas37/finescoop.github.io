<p>Leipzig want Sorloth to replace Timo Werner, following his £49m move to Chelsea, after the Norwegian’s stunning season on loan at Trabzonspor.</p>

<p>Sorloth, 24, joined Palace in January 2018 for around £9m from FC Midtjylland but scored just once in 20 appearances before being loaned to Gent a year later.</p>

<p>Crystal Palace have rejected a £20m offer for Alexander Sorloth from RB Leipzig</p>

<p>Sorloth then joined Trabzonspor last summer on a two-year loan and has been in sensational form, scoring 33 times in 49 games for last season’s Turkish league runners up.</p>

<p>Leipzig are now keen to sign Sorloth with another of their striker targets Patrick Schick poised to join Bayer Leverkusen.</p>

<p>Sorloth has been in blistering form for Trabzonspor, scoring 33 times in 49 games</p>

<p>Leipzig want to secure Sorloth as a permanent replacement for Timo Werner, now at Chelsea</p>

<p>Because Trabzonspor still have a season left on their loan deal and an obligation to buy Sorloth next summer, any deal to sell him in this window would have to also be sanctioned by the Turkish club.</p>

<p>Trabzonspor manager, former Chelsea player and coach Eddie Newton, said last month: ‘If someone wants to purchase him at an agreed price then I think it would be foolhardy for the club to turn it down.’</p>
