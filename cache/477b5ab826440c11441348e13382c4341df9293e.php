<p>She's finally arrived! Carole Baskin sent the Loose Women panel a pre-recorded clip on Thursday, a week after cancelling her interview on the ITV programme</p>

<p>The media personality addressed her no-show earlier this month as she admitted she's been preoccupied with dance commitments on the US version of Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

<p>The reality star said: 'I'm happy that my husband will be stepping in and speaking for me. He is such a wonderful person and you'll love him so much as I love him so much.</p>

<p>'In fact, when he's done I want him back girls... if you don't send him back, you're kind of asking for a Baskin!'</p>

<p>'Oooh, asking for a Baskin. What is a Baskin?', presenter Christine, 41, squealed, before comedian Judi, 40, joked: 'We don't want to find out, send him back quick time! Listen, I was obsessed with that show, there's too much juice!'</p>

<p>Exciting times ahead: The big-cat rights activist, 59, revealed to viewers that her husband Howard will be stepping in to discuss all things Tiger King via live link on Friday's edition</p>

<p>Uh oh: The reality star issued a warning to Jane Moore, Christine Lampard, Judi Love and Gloria Hunniford as she claimed they'll be 'asking for a Baskin' if he doesn't return in one piece</p>

<p>Speaking out: The Big Cat Rescue CEO addressed her no-show as she admitted she's been preoccupied with dance commitments on the US version of Strictly</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Loose Women viewers were left bitterly disappointed when Baskin cancelled her appearance  on the show. </p>

<p>Despite being tipped to chat to the panel, the big cat enthusiast cancelled at the last minute, in a move that came hours after her late husband Don Lewis's family funded an advertisement during her Dancing With The Stars debut. </p>

<p>She caused shockwaves when she signed up to Dancing With The Stars and keen to capitalise on her appearance, Don's relatives opted to take out an advert seeking information on his alleged murder. </p>

<p>Outrage: Earlier this month, Loose Women viewers were left bitterly disappointed when Baskin cancelled her appearance on the show</p>

<p>After Tiger King hit Netflix earlier this year, many viewers were intrigued by rumours that she had killed Don and fed him to the big cats in her sanctuary.</p>

<p>Despite incessant denials, the Lewis family used her DWTS debut to air a 50-second clip calling for information about his 1997 disappearance in 1997 and offered a $100,000 reward is being offered for any leads.</p>

<p>Following the advert's release, Carole said: 'I haven't seen it, but I'm not surprised. Spending time worrying about what I’m doing is probably not a really good use of your time', before she insisted the move was a publicity stunt. </p>

<p>Oh no: The big cat enthusiast cancelled at the last minute, in a move that came hours after her late husband's family funded an advertisement during her Dancing With The Stars debut</p>

<p>The scandal surrounding the advert led to debate that her reason for cancelling on Loose Women was due to the controversy. </p>

<p>Andrea McLean said on the show: 'Carole has denied any involvement in husband's disappearance, he has formally been declared dead, she is now remarried.'</p>

<p>As well as the advert hypothesis, other angry viewers alleged that the producers had merely been drawing in viewers and claimed the incident was 'a s**t show'. </p>

<p>After the show aired, the panellists reached out to Carole with a video saying they were always there for her if she needs be. </p>

<p>Carole reportedly said: 'I am so sorry, I screwed up my ever changing schedule, phone of hook with fan support/interviews... I have hours where Dancing With The Stars wants me. That has to be my priority.'</p>

<p>Viewers soon flooded Twitter, writing: 'Come on <?php echo e('@'); ?>loosewomen Carol Baskin mugged you off big time !! Couldn't even be bothered to apologise to you...</p>

<p>Not convinced: Viewers weren't  happy </p>

<p>'Don't blame the time difference (she managed to 'commit' knowing this), don't blame an advert we probably weren't likely to have seen, have some manner... </p>

<p>'Sorry but how the f**k has #LooseWomen been allowed to advertise Carol Baskin appearing on their show all morning knowing that wasn’t going to happen... </p>

<p>'What a s**t show... Wtf #loosewomen so I've just sat though all that waiting for Carol Baskin and the drama and there isn't again... </p>

<p>Outrage: Fan flooded social media to comment on the debacle </p>

<p>'I only turned into this gargabe for the Carole Baskin interview, this show should be axed... Carole Baskin thinks she is too good for #LooseWomen... </p>

<p>'You don’t have a lot of time with her because you wasted time on that non interview with Carole Baskin #LooseWomen... Why was the whole Carole Baskin interview made such a big deal of there?! Struggling for content maybe? #LooseWomen... </p>

<p>'Carole Baskin has apparently promised to give #LooseWomen her first UK exclusive interview? First the exclusive ‘Coronavirus whistleblower’ and now this.' [sic]</p>

<p>'His big interview with Carol Baskin they’ve been banging on about for days and it never happened. Why not say that in the first place? Desperate for viewers much?!'</p>
