<p>Scott Morrison (pictured, with daughter Lily) has celebrated Father's Day by putting the finishing touches on a cubby house he helped build with his youngest daughter</p>

<p>'It's hard to find that time, especially given the demands of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and recession.</p>

<p>'So when my youngest daughter Lily wanted to build a cubby house for her school passion project, this was a great opportunity.' </p>

<p>Mr Morrison was spotted making several trips to Bunnings over recent weeks to pick up supplies.</p>

<p>His office released a compilation video that showcased the build from start to finish.</p>

<p>'I am here with Lily and we are here to build a cubby house today,' Mr Morrison says.</p>

<p>'We've been to Bunnings. We've got all the wood. We've measured it all out and we're all ready to go. This is quite a family project.' </p>

<p>Though, Mr Morrison didn't just bang nails into the wood with a hammer.  </p>

<p>He also accidentally hammered his left index finger, leaving him with a badly bruised and swollen nail.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison will spend Father's Day with his wife Jenny and two girls, which includes his eldest daughter Abbey.</p>

<p>This is the first Father's Day Mr Morrison will celebrate without his own father John, who passed away in January.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison took to Instagram to make a heartbreaking tribute to his father following the news.  </p>

<p>'He was a loving husband to my mum Marion for 57 years. </p>

<p>'He was a wonderful father to me and my brother Alan. He loved Jen as a daughter and was a devoted grandfather to our girls.</p>

<p>'Love you Dad and well done good and faithful servant.'</p>
