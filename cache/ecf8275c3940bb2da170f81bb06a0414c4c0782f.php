<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Georginio Wijnaldum will meet Jurgen Klopp for talks when he returns to Liverpool for key talks on his future.</p>

<p>The Netherlands midfielder is wanted by Barcelona head coach Ronald Koeman and has entered the final 12 months of his Anfield contract.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum has not given any indication so far that he would be prepared to leave and has carried on with business as usual.</p>

<p>Georginio Wijnaldum will hold talks over his future, with Barcelona interested in the midfielder</p>

<p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp would be happy to keep him, but hasn't offered a deal yet</p>

<p>Klopp would be happy for the 29-year-old to remain but will discuss the situation with Wijnaldum face-to-face to work out a plan.</p>

<p>Should Barcelona give Liverpool the chance to cash in on Wijnaldum, it would pave the way for Liverpool to move for Bayern Munich’s Thiago Alcantara. </p>

<p>However the Catalans are also interested in a move for their former player, as their summer rebuild begins.  </p>

<p>Netherlands beat Poland 1-0 in their first Nations League match on Friday thanks to a late goal from Steven Bergwijn.</p>

<p>Barcelona's new manager Ronald Koeman is looking to rebuild the team this summer</p>

<p>However they lost 1-0 to Italy on Friday, as Nicolo Barella found the net in first-half injury time.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum has scored 19 goals and provided 16 assists in 187 games for Liverpool since joining from Newcastle in 2016. </p>

<p>He has played an important role in the team, but he has yet to be offered a new deal and there is a possibility that he could depart before the closure of the transfer window as the club are reluctant to lose him on a free transfer at the end of his contract. </p>
