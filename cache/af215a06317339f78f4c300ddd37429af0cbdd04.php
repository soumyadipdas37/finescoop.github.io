<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Belarus opposition leader was arrested at the Ukrainian border early this morning a day after she was allegedly kidnapped on the streets of Minsk.  </p>

<p>Border guards said Maria Kolesnikova had arrived at the crossing in the early hours of Tuesday, with state television announcing that Kolesnikova had been detained while two others entered Ukraine. </p>

<p>Friends of the 38-year-old say she was snatched by masked men who bundled her into a van on Monday and drove her away, leaving her allies unable to contact her.  </p>

<p>Kolesnikova is part of a female triumvirate challenging the rule of 'Europe's last dictator' Alexander Lukashenko, but was the only one who remained in Belarus after last month's disputed election led to a crackdown in the ex-Soviet country. </p>

<p>Maria Kolesnikova (pictured) was arrested at the Ukrainian border this morning, state television said a day after she was allegedly kidnapped in Minsk </p>

<p>Britain and Germany were last night demanding answers on Kolesnikova's whereabouts after she and two others went missing. </p>

<p>'Lukashenko's regime must make her safe return their highest priority,' said UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab. </p>

<p>His German counterpart Heiko Maas demanded 'clarity on the whereabouts and the release of all political prisoners in Belarus'.  </p>

<p>Kolesnikova's friends say she was snatched along with a spokesman and executive secretary of the Coordination Council, which is aiming to secure a peaceful transfer of power. </p>

<p>'We still don't know where Maria is and what is happening to her,' said lawyer Maxim Znak, a member of the Coordination Council, in a video blog on Monday evening. </p>

<p>Opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya rejected Lukashenko's claim to have won the August 9 election with 80 per cent of the vote, extending his 26-year rule. </p>

<p>Tikhanovskaya, Kolesnikova and a third woman Veronika Tsepkalo, fronted the campaign against Lukashenko which drew enthusiastic support at rallies.</p>

<p>But the aftermath of the election has degenerated into protests and a crackdown by police which saw 633 people detained on Sunday. </p>

<p>The disputed election has led to mass protests in Minsk, pictured here on Sunday with people waving opposition flags </p>

<p>The European Union on Monday led calls for Belarus to immediately release the hundreds of protesters.  </p>

<p>'The EU expects the Belarusian authorities to ensure the immediate release of all detained on political grounds before and after the falsified 9 August presidential elections,' its diplomatic head Josep Borrell said.</p>

<p>'The EU will impose sanctions on individuals responsible for violence, repression and falsification of election results,' he added.</p>

<p>Canada's foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne called 'for the release of people detained including opposition members and journalists.</p>

<p>'The most recent arbitrary arrests of leading opposition voices and acts of repression are unacceptable,' he said.</p>

<p>Tikhanovskaya left the country under pressure from the authorities and was granted refuge by EU member Lithuania.</p>

<p>'The more they try to scare us, the more people will take to the streets,' Tikhanovskaya said in a statement.</p>

<p>Lukashenko (pictured in Minsk last week) is facing the biggest challenge to his rule since taking power in the ex-Soviet republic in 1994 </p>

<p>Police on Sunday appeared to be stepping up a campaign to quash the demonstrations, deploying troops, water cannon and armoured vehicles.</p>

<p>Local media reported hooded men in civilian clothes with batons chased and beat demonstrators. </p>

<p>Belarusian authorities had already detained several members of the Coordination Council and others have left the country under official pressure. </p>

<p>One, Olga Kovalkova, said on Saturday she was in Poland after security services threatened her and took her to the border.</p>

<p>Kolesnikova and other members including Nobel Literature Prize winner Svetlana Alexievich have faced questioning in a probe over an alleged bid to seize power.  </p>

<p>Kolesnikova, a trained flautist and music teacher, entered politics to run the campaign of another opposition politician, ex-banker Viktor Babaryko, who attempted to stand for president against Lukashenko but was jailed and barred from running.</p>
