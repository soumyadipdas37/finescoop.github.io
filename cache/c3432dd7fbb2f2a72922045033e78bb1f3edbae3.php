<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Football clubs are bracing themselves for another crushing financial blow as the Government prepare to open their long-awaited review into betting.</p>

<p>But the managing director of prominent gambling firm 32Red, who sponsor Derby County, is adamant the industry is committed to cleaning up its act ahead of the impending review.</p>

<p>It is understood government ministers plan to open their audit into the 2005 Gambling Act within a matter of weeks.</p>

<p>Review set to have major impact on the relationship between betting firms and football clubs</p>

<p>The review is set to have a major impact on the historical relationship between betting firms and football clubs.</p>

<p>Sponsorship and commercial deals with gambling brands are worth millions of pounds of revenue for clubs every season.</p>

<p>A quarter of Premier League clubs will have gambling companies as their main shirt sponsors this season, while many more teams have various lower level deals with firms in the industry.</p>

<p>Likewise, a number of cash-strapped EFL clubs have lucrative commercial contracts with gambling firms. Indeed, the EFL’s main sponsor is sports gaming company Sky Bet.</p>

<p>A quarter of Premier League clubs will have gambling companies as their main shirt sponsor</p>

<p>Among the possible changes to the Act that have been mooted ahead of the Government review is a blanket ban on shirt sponsorship by betting companies across sport in the UK.</p>

<p>At the very least, gambling firms are likely to be required to provide tangible evidence of their commitment to promoting responsible gambling before any sponsorship deals can be signed off.</p>

<p>With clubs facing hugely uncertain financial futures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, sponsorship deals will prove more crucial than ever as teams look to stay afloat.</p>

<p>And their is growing concern the outcome of the forthcoming Government review could have major repercussions for clubs across the country.</p>

<p>Neil Banbury, managing director of 32Red, who are Derby’s main shirt sponsor, has welcomed the imminent review provided it’s balanced - but says EFL clubs stand to lose out significantly if the Government place more stringing regulations on betting sponsorship.</p>

<p>Clubs are facing hugely uncertain financial futures as a result of the coronavirus pandemic </p>

<p>He said: ‘Clubs are increasingly socially aware. I think ultimately the role of sponsorship in it's commercial revenue stream is probably more important in the EFL than in the Premier League, where broadcasting is a much bigger contributor.</p>

<p>‘What we are finding is that clubs are now doing more due diligence to get deals through their boards and have them signed off.</p>

<p>'As long as the Government review brings in views from across the spectrum that is evidence-based and it’s focused on tackling the real issues the industry has then hopeful we can move to a better position.</p>

<p>‘Every operator is coming at it from a different angle. But we all want to be part of the solution in that we want to be part of moving everyone to a much better and sustainable position.</p>

<p>‘Some companies have called for the end of sponsorship. But we are coming from place that we see it as a good opportunity to do some really good and visible work.</p>

<p>But ultimately the industry can talk about doing the right thing and providing a much healthier environment for customers but we have to be seen and believed that it’ s truly the case. We have huge duty to improve our side of the industry.’</p>
