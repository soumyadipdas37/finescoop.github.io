<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A delivery driver has proposed to his girlfriend with a 'will you marry me' tattoo on his chest - and she clearly ticked the right box as she said 'yes'.</p>

<p>Smitten Bruno Neves, 33, wanted to ask his partner Patricia Calado, 34, to marry him after a trip to his favourite tattoo parlour in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two was 'confused' when he first showed her the new inking - after she had spent 45 minutes in the waiting room of Arron Adams' A Sailor's Grave tattoo studio.</p>

<p>Mr Adams, who is also a father to a four-year-old son, had written the words 'will you marry me' in permanent ink across Bruno's chest. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two was 'confused' when Bruno first showed her the new inking. 'Will you marry me' had been penned across his chest</p>

<p>But the hotel cleaner quickly grabbed a pen and ticked the yes box.</p>

<p>She said: 'It was a complete surprise. He has some tattoos that he wants to get covered up and sometimes I will go along with him and wait so I though it was all quite normal. </p>

<p>'I was quite confused when he came out and revealed that tattoo to me. It took a moment to realise what it was. </p>

<p>'Then I just laughed and told him "you're crazy" but of course I ticked yes. I am very happy.'</p>

<p>Bruno, who boasts a collection of 20 tattoos, said: 'It was a dream come true.'</p>

<p>The hotel cleaner quickly grabbed a pen and ticked the yes box. The couple decided not to kiss to celebrate the moment because of the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Tattoo artist Arron said it is the first time he has ever helped someone propose through ink.  </p>

<p>Patricia added it was 'very strange' being proposed to in a public place during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>She said: 'I didn't know how to react. We both had our masks on, so we didn't kiss each other, just out of respect for the other people there.'</p>

<p>She added Bruno is very romantic, and surprises her every month on the 11th - to mark the "anniversary" of each month they have been together.</p>

<p>'Every month on the 11th he will take me travelling somewhere, or we will go out for a nice dinner,' she said.</p>

<p>Patricia said Bruno was very romantic and surprises her every month on the 11th - to mark the "anniversary" of each month they have been together</p>

<p>The couple are now hoping to tie the knot in August next year - and Bruno says he has already been emailing priests to try and get a date booked in</p>

<p>And Bruno said that Patricia accepting his proposal was 'amazing'.</p>

<p>He said: 'If it hadn't been for Covid, I would have done it sooner. I had been planning the tattoo for around five or six months.</p>

<p>'We have been together for a year and a half - but I am absolutely certain about Patricia.</p>

<p>'We have spent every day together for the past two years, and we have seen how our families connect together, so I had no fear about proposing to her.</p>

<p>'I would not have done it if I had not been absolutely sure - a tattoo is something you really have to think about.'</p>

<p>The couple are now hoping to tie the knot in August next year - and Bruno says he has already been emailing priests to try and get a date booked in.</p>

<p>Bruno held a piece of tissue paper over the tattoo before pulling it away to unveil his latest inking and propose to his girlfriend</p>

<p>Mr Adams, who did the tattoo for Bruno, said he has never done a tattoo proposal before - but is 'always up for a challenge'.</p>

<p>He said: 'It did feel a bit strange. I've never actually done anything like that one before.</p>

<p>'I was a bit nervous myself - as tattoo artists, we advise people against having names tattooed on them or anything like that, because obviously it is permanent.</p>

<p>'But Bruno told me he wanted to do something a bit crazy - and I thought, yeah, let's go for it.</p>

<p>Patricia said it was 'very strange' being proposed to in a public place during the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Adams, who did the tattoo for Bruno, said he has never done a tattoo proposal before - but is 'always up for a challenge'</p>

<p>'It's lucky she said yes - because I said to Bruno that even if she had said no, I would have tattooed that on him, too.</p>

<p>'He was really chuffed. I could see as he was walking out to reveal the tattoo that he was extremely nervous.</p>

<p>'She was really shocked and surprised when she saw it. It was a lovely moment.</p>

<p>'It was really nice for me to be a part of that special moment for someone. It made me feel really good - like a little Cupid.'</p>
