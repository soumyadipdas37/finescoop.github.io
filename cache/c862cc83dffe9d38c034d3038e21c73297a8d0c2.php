<p>Strongman: Hafthor Björnsson, 31, showed off his hulking physique as he posed for Men's Health magazine and discussed breaking the world deadlift record</p>

<p>Speaking about his record-breaking feat, the actor said: 'After the lift, I was over the moon. Especially with how well I felt. After Eddie Hall did his 500kg, he almost died. </p>

<p>'He didn’t look good. He was bleeding in his nose, eyes and ears. He fell down and I saw that and I thought, "Is this going to be worth it?" But I pulled the weight and I felt great.</p>

<p>'I saw the people not believing [in me] and saying that it’s not possible and the guy that did 500kg almost died and he’s supposed to be the best ever in deadlifting – but I believed. I worked hard and then I pulled 501kg without almost dying.'</p>

<p>The strongman has adopted a new diet in preparation for his fight with Eddie, saying he now has a lot more energy since losing weight. </p>

<p>Record: The Game of Thrones star deadlifted an eye-watering 501kg, smashing the previous world record of 500kg held by Eddie Hall, saying he simply 'worked hard'</p>

<p>He said: 'I used to have six eggs [for breakfast] with rice and spinach but, this morning, I only had five eggs and just spinach. I skipped the rice. </p>

<p>'I’m trying to lose weight for the fight. It’s working well: I’ve already lost 16kg. For the deadlift, I weighed 206kg. Today, I weigh 190kg. It feels great – I have much more energy.'</p>

<p>Having trained with top athletes, Hafthor admitted the person who surprised him the most when he trained with them was internet personality Dan Bilzerian.</p>

<p>He said: 'He’s quite a humble guy. People will see something on the internet and automatically, you know, judge, but I try not to. </p>

<p>'I’m very neutral – he surprised me a lot. He’s a very down-to-earth guy and super nice. I thought he would be louder and more of a showman. He was quite quiet and very respectful.' </p>
