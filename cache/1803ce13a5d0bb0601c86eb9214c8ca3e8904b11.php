<p>She continued: 'I can't have a broken nail for two weeks, that can't happen! I need to order some superglue.'</p>

<p>Tamara arrived in Queensland on Monday and is required to isolate in a hotel for two weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<p>'I am quarantining for 14 days in Brisbane. I'm not planning to stay here, I'm going to go up to the Gold Coast but I flew in here,' she explained.</p>

<p>'[After arriving] I was met by about 50 policeman and 50 army men. It's pretty hectic as you get ushered into a bus and straight to a hotel,' she said.</p>

<p>'This can't happen!' She shared a video to Instagram stories complaining about the 'disaster' on day one of her two-week isolation</p>

<p>Tamara's post comes after she copped a brutal spray from her father over her 'clown' look due to her use of lip fillers.</p>

<p>In a series of videos, the 31-year-old's father brought her a coffee in bed, before he unleashed on her love of cosmetic injectables.</p>

<p>'You look like a clown!' Tamara's post comes after she copped a brutal spray from her own father (pictured) over her 'clown' look due to her use of lip fillers on Wednesday</p>

<p>'The lips. It's old hat. It's in the past. Move on. It's ridiculous,' Tamara's father, Les, is seen telling his daughter in the clip.</p>

<p>'So, I'm out of fashion because my lips are big?' she asks Les with a laugh, indicating that the pair are close and that their clash was in good fun. </p>

<p>'It's not natural. It looks ridiculous, I think. You look like a clown mate. But that's just ridiculous,' he continued. </p>

<p>Loose lips: Tamara's dad was less than impressed with his reality star daughter's artificial pout</p>
