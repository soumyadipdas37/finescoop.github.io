<p>The reality of 'COVID-safe' flying: This photo of a crowded Jetstar flight, posted on social media on Thursday, shows how passengers aren't socially distancing despite airport rules </p>

<p>Only a handful of passengers in the picture seem to be wearing face masks.</p>

<p>Ms Vernon, who lives in Melbourne, pointed out the discrepancy between the rules enforced at airports and how people actually behave on flights.  </p>

<p>She captioned the image: 'Jetstar - please use social distancing at airport. Also Jetstar - cramming flights for cash.'   </p>

<p>The airline, which owns Jetstar, 'strongly recommends' passengers wear face masks on all flights but notes that 'the risk of in-flight transmission remains extremely low'. </p>

<p>Qantas and Jetstar also provide passengers with a Fly Well pack comprising a face mask and sanitising wipes for the flight, and recommend that travellers limit their movement around the cabin.</p>

<p>Explaining why the risk of transmitting coronavirus is low, the Qantas website states: 'The aircraft configuration, including the seats and galley, act as a natural barrier, and people are not seated face to face. The direction of in-flight airflow is ceiling to floor.'</p>

<p>It also notes that the plane's cabins are fitted with hospital-grade HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filters and that the air inside is refreshed every few minutes.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Qantas and Ms Vernon for comment.</p>
