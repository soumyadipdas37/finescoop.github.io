<p>The Montanaro UK Smaller Companies Trust invests in small firms listed on the London Stock Exchange and the junior market AIM. </p>

<p>Managed by Charles Montanaro, who founded and owns the parent investment firm, it aims to grow investors' money rather than focus on giving them an income.</p>

<p>What does it invest in?</p>

<p>Its biggest exposure is to the industrials sector. Top ten holdings include investment software firm Integrafin, components manufacturer Discoverie Group and vets supplier Dechra Pharmaceuticals.</p>

<p>What do the experts like?</p>

<p>Dewi John, head of Lipper Research at Refinitiv, points out that while smaller companies tend to be under-researched by analysts, the trust has a well-resourced team to do its own research.</p>

<p>Any downsides?</p>

<p>John adds: 'Given the UK economy's relative weakness through Covid, and the renewed uncertainties of Brexit, smaller companies face a challenging time. </p>

<p>Montanaro's more concentrated portfolio than most of its UK Small Companies peers could mean less diversification, and so greater risk.'</p>
