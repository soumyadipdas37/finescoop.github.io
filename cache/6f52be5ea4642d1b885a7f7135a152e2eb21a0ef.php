<p>The footage, from March 2017, shows the calf running after several horses in Mountain View, Arkansas. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the cow, named Annabelle, is unable to keep up with the horses, who have not been identified. </p>

<p>Several horses have been filmed running across a field in Mountain View, Arkansas </p>

<p>It appears that among the horses is a donkey, who his not as quick, as the footage shows </p>

<p>Though the donkey is considerably quicker than the cow which follows the group</p>
