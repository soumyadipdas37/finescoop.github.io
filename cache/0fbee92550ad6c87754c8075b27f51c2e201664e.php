<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The boss of National Grid has warned Britain will be at risk of power blackouts due to a decaying electricity network after he asked Ofgem for the right to raise customers' bills.</p>

<p>CEO John Pettigrew fears power lines in parts of the country will 'decay,' after energy regulator Ofgem denied the National Grid's suggestion to charge consumers for replacing them.</p>

<p>According to The Times, the utility group, along with SSE and Scottish power, has reached a stalemate with Ofgem over a settlement that would have returns from next year and cancel billions of pounds worth of investments.</p>

<p>National Grid CEO John Pettigrew fears power lines in parts of the country will 'decay,' without proper funding</p>

<p>Ofgem claims the settlments will provide better value for money for customers. </p>

<p>But cancelled projects are already putting puts of the UK at greater risk of blackouts, Mr Pettigrew warned.</p>

<p>He claims the National Grid had £40million plans to replace one of the Sheffield's only two power lines. </p>

<p>Should one of those power lines fail, the only source of electricity for the entire city would be the other line. </p>

<p>Ofgem reportedly told The Times that the National Grid did not demonstrate the need for a replacement. </p>

<p>Speaking on the wider issue, Mr Pettigrew told The Times: 'It is deeply concerning for us because ultimately you're increasing the risk on the network.</p>

<p>'The risk of a loss of supply increases as a result of not spending as much on asset health, because the assets are deteriorating as they age.' </p>

<p>Some cities, such as Sheffield, could be at greater risk of blackouts, as they rely on fewer power lines for their supply, Mr Pettigrew warned</p>

<p>Mr Pettigrew also warned that the need to cut funds will likely result in job losses at the National Grid and its supply chain.  </p>

<p>He claimed plans to spend £10billion on UK networks have been halved by current proposals.</p>

<p>Ofgem, however, say the draft plan could create jobs.   </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for the regulator told The Times: 'Wherever network companies have demonstrated they need vital funding, we have given them the go ahead.'</p>

<p>She added it would not allow for billions of pounds to spent on proposals that were described as poorly evidenced.  </p>
