<p>GBBO revealed just last week they had finished filming for the upcoming series. Posting a picture of the iconic kitchen to Instagram, they penned: 'Filming has wrapped on the new series of The Great British Bake Off. More news soon...' </p>

<p>Filming for the next season began last month at a private location in Essex, just a stone's throw from judge Paul Hollywood's home. </p>

<p>Despite being considered a high-risk candidate for coronavirus, his co-host, Judge Prue Leith, 80, will still be presenting on this year's show. </p>

<p>Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air.</p>

<p>She credited stringent health and safety measures, testing and quarantine regimes for the return of the hit baking series.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile it has been reported that judge Paul wants to continue using his trademark move in the upcoming Great British Bake Off season, despite fears of spreading coronavirus.  </p>

<p>The baking maestro, 54, intends on defying social-distancing rules as the Channel 4 program clarified they will follow strict safety protocol so that all parties are free to handshake to their heart's content.  </p>

<p>According to a report in The Sun, Paul has been given the green light to handshake cast members as producers believe the show wouldn't be the same without his signature move.</p>

<p>Exciting! The trailer is set to debut on Channel 4 television screens at 9pm on Tuesday evening  (former presenter Sandi Toksvig, judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood, and host Noel Fielding  L-R) </p>

<p>To ensure safety at all times, the upcoming season is being filmed in an isolation bubble, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing. </p>

<p>A source said: 'In these strange times, producers want the 2020 series to be as close to normal as possible and they feel that it wouldn’t be the same without a Hollywood handshake. </p>

<p>'The judges and hosts — and the contestants — have all been deemed clear because of the bio-secure bubble and regular testing.</p>

<p>'So if the baking is up to scratch, we’ll see some handshakes, and not elbow bumps, being dished out before long.'</p>

<p>Paul's handshake is widely regarded as the golden ticket for bakers who aim to meet his high expectations or win Star Baker of the week. </p>

<p>The first time that fans witnessed Paul's congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. </p>

<p>The program was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.  </p>

<p>Fellow Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig revealed that she had left the show earlier this year and was replaced by Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas </p>

<p>Matt will partner up with fellow funnyman, Noel Fielding, 47, who originally joined the Great British Bake Off Cast in 2017. </p>
