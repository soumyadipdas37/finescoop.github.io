<p>'Where did the years go?' On Tuesday, The Project's Lisa Wilkinson took time off from her hectic schedule as she wished her son Jake a happy 27th birthday.</p>

<p>In the snap shared to her Instagram, Lisa couldn't wipe the smile from her face as she posed with her son Jake. </p>

<p>In the caption, she wrote: 'My beautiful birthday boy. Where DID those 27 years go sweetheart?</p>

<p>'Thank you for reminding me every day the stuff that truly counts. (And for bringing me to tears by playing me “Let It Be” for the very first time on your birthday. </p>

<p>'After all those piano lessons you hated as a kid, you couldn’t have surprised or thrilled me more...) Xxxxx,' Lisa concluded. </p>

<p>'What truly counts': The 60-year-old gushed about her son reminding her about 'the things that truly count' while admitting that his musical talents brought her to tears</p>

<p>This comes after Lisa struggled to regain her composure after an F-bomb blooper on a recent episode of The Project.</p>

<p>Lisa slumped over the desk and was in fits of laughter, after a sports segment saw a passionate mother mouthing "f**k off!" from the sidelines.</p>

<p>'I believe she said it was a "fair call",' Lisa's co-host Tommy Little quipped.</p>

<p>Tommy, 35, introduced the segment that saw mother Kim Stojanov proudly watching her son Cody Ramsey's NRL debut.</p>

<p>While a pre-game interview saw Kim understandably getting emotional, her demeanour changed on the sidelines critiquing a referee's decision.</p>

<p>Channel Ten muted her blunt remarks, but on screen it was quite clear the words she had mouthed off in fury.</p>

<p>Lisa, who did not see the F-bomb coming, laughed uncontrollably while slumped over the desk.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Lisa hasn't been able to hide her shock while hosting the current affairs program.</p>

<p>Last month, the former Today show star gasped in horror over a comment made by co-host Tommy.   </p>

<p>'You can't say that!' Meanwhile, this isn't the first time Lisa hasn't been able to hide her shock while hosting the current affairs program. Pictured last month</p>

<p>Condition: Last month, singer Thelma Plum (pictured) revealed how she developed 'dysosmia' - where everything tastes like 'garbage' - when recovering from COVID-19 earlier this year </p>

<p>Singer Thelma Plum appeared on the show where she discussed having developed 'dysosmia' - a disordered sense of smell and taste - after recovering from COVID-19 earlier this year.</p>

<p>After Thelma, 25, revealed that everything tastes like 'garbage', Tommy quipped that he had a similar condition growing up with his mother's cooking.</p>

<p>Lisa gasped and then remarked: 'You can't say that!'   </p>

<p>Tommy responded in a joking manner: 'I had a similar condition that was called "growing up with my mum's cooking"' </p>
