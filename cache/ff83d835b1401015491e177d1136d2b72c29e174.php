<p>'Who's gonna eat this?' husband John Legend, 41, asked, to which she passionately responded: 'Me! I'm going to... Oh my god, the cord.'</p>

<p>She then joked with daughter Luna Simone, four: 'Luna, did you know that you can make this into a smoothie? This whole thing? You can make it into a smoothie.'</p>

<p>Staying healthy: Chrissy later posted another video to her Insta Story, giving a glimpse of a compression device wrapped around her leg, during bed rest</p>

<p>Whoops! The topic of blood clots apparently carried on into a private group chat after that post, as she revealed she accidentally sent a very graphic photo to the wrong chat</p>

<p>Chrissy later posted another video to her Insta Story, giving a glimpse of a compression device wrapped around her leg, during bed rest.</p>

<p>She explained: 'A lot of you got a glimpse of these guys. It is like a little machine that compresses your legs. You get it when you're on bed rest or when you're in the hospital, so you don't get blood clots.</p>

<p>'Because that's what happens when you lay down for too long, and it can be really dangerous. So, I have these on for a few weeks.'</p>

<p>The topic of blood clots apparently carried on into a private group chat after that post, as she revealed she accidentally sent a very graphic photo to the wrong chat.</p>

<p>The Lip Sync Battle host checked in once again, this time using a dog face filter, telling her 31.3million followers: 'I just sent the most disgusting photo to the group chat of a blood clot that I like caught... from my pee.</p>

<p>'It was huge. I don't know if it's a clot, I don't know what the hell it is. It's like a giant ball, a bloody ball. And I posted it in the group chat, but it was the wrong group chat.'</p>

<p>Mama's boy: Chrissy previously posted the baby's first 3D ultrasound to her story, writing: 'Hi my sweet strong boy. You are working so hard, I promise it'll be worth it!!!'</p>

<p>Gender reveal: It comes after she accidentally revealed the sex of their new baby to her followers last week in another Insta Story</p>

<p>It's a boy! Chrissy said while opening up about the complications that required her bed rest: 'It's so weird because the baby's really really healthy. He's big. He’s probably, oops! That was stupid'</p>

<p>Bed rest: But she remained optimistic about her new addition: 'We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest'</p>

<p>Postponed: She recently revealed that she's put her third cookbook on hold indefinitely, amid complications with the pregnancy (pictured in September, 2018)</p>

<p>She continued: 'It’s always been kind of the bad part of my pregnancies with Luna. With Miles, it just stopped feeding him. It stopped taking care of him. </p>

<p>'I was stealing all his food because I was getting huge but he wasn’t getting big at all, so he had to come out early and Luna had to come out early. I was induced both times.'</p>

<p>But The Chrissy's Court star remained optimistic about her new addition: 'Everything’s good. I’m feeling really good, but my placenta’s really, really weak and it’s causing me to really bleed a lot. So basically, it’s just pretty high risk.</p>

<p>'This poor thing has been through so much already. We just have to get my placenta healthy again, and that means not moving so I’m on complete and total "don’t get out except to pee-pee" bed rest.'</p>
