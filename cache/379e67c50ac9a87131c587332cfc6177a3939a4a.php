<p>The 32-year-old suffered a crushing defeat to Tim Tszyu in Townsville a fortnight ago, prompting calls from his father to end his 24-year professional boxing career.</p>

<p>Horn said he is struggling to come to terms with the pressure from his wife and other family members.</p>

<p>'Jo has been happy for a while for me to hang up the gloves. She wants me to stop fighting, she hates the stress of me fighting and what I have to go through to get ready for a campaign,' Horn told the Courier Mail. </p>

<p>'She doesn't like watching what happened to me in the last fight and she doesn't want it to happen again.</p>

<p>'Look, I understand why people want me to retire and I'm hearing it from my wife and my close family members. They are saying, 'You have done enough and you have done yourself proud, so just let it go'.'</p>

<p>He said he is going back and forth over whether or not he will end his career after losing the the IBF Australasian super welterweight title. </p>

<p>The Hornet's wife Jo (pictured together) has been bugging her husband regularly to retire </p>

<p>Some days he says his competitive nature and drive to win spurs him on more than the exhaustion of pushing his body to the limit for so many years.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the aftermath of the devastating loss, the Hornet has revealed a minor health scare which surfaced a week before the bout.</p>

<p>The professional boxer was mysteriously stuck down with vertigo.</p>

<p>But when he got blood tests done after the match in Townsville everything appeared normal.</p>

<p>He still has no idea what was causing the dizzy spells.</p>

<p>Horn acknowledged his performance on the day was a result of his own failings rather than his trainers.</p>

<p>The Hornet said maybe he simply no longer has what it takes to defeat someone as young and hungry as Tim Tszyu, Australia's new number one boxer.</p>

<p>The son of boxing hall-of-famer Kostya Tszyu controlled Australia's fight of the year, and forced Horn - who beat the great Manny Pacquiao in 2017 - to look second rate. </p>

<p>Tszyu's WBO Global and Australian IBF super welterweight title retention sets him on track for a potential world title fight, while a series of bouts in Russia are also on the cards. </p>
