<p>With the polyp gone, Dr Fauci's gravelly voice seems have smoothed out. </p>

<p>A few Twitter users even said they missed his signature sound - but were glad he had recovered smoothly. </p>

<p>The physician told the Today show he'd followed doctors' orders and spent about five days keeping quiet. </p>

<p>But already, he was back to overdoing it by Monday, and could feel the difference. </p>

<p>'[There were] a bunch of emergency catastrophic White House-related..."crises," that I had to into animated discussions [for] and I kicked myself after that because it didn't feel 100 percent great like it did after the five days...so I had to back off,' Dr Fauci told the Today show's Sheinelle Jones. </p>

<p>Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been the most vocal of the COVID-19 task force members throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>Dr Fauci told the Today show's Sheinelle Jones that he'd overdone it following the surgery and wasn't feeling as good as he had after five days of resting his voice </p>

<p>At the start of the outbreak, Fauci would regularly appear at White House coronavirus briefings alongside President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>He, along with task force coordinator Dr Deborah Birx, have repeatedly faced tension with Trump as the pandemic has worn on after publicly contradicting the rosy picture the president has painted of the virus.</p>

<p>Now, instead of appearing frequently at White House briefings, Fauci has been conducting interviews, testifying in front of Congress and speaking mostly at private events organized by universities and medical facilities.</p>

<p>Back in April, Fauci addressed his hoarse voice after he croaked his way through a live TV interview with the Today show's Savannah Guthrie.</p>

<p>'I'm physically fine,' he said when asked about his own health.</p>

<p>'All I do all day long is brief people. I just need to keep my mouth shut for a little while and it will get better.'</p>

<p>His surgery came in a week where Fauci participated in a series of interviews and online events related to a variety of different matters concerning the ongoing outbreak.</p>

<p>The most recent speaking engagement was on Wednesday where he spoke a COVID-19 vaccine during a video talk organized by George Washington University.</p>

<p>The coronavirus task force member said he had to engage in 'animated discussions' related to the White House following his surgery. Tensions have risen between Dr Fauci and Trump over the last several months </p>

<p>His most recent speaking engagement before undergoing surgery was on Wednesday (pictured above) where he spoke a COVID-19 vaccine during a video talk organized by George Washington University</p>

<p>He already has virtual speaking engagements lined up for next week, including one with the University of California, Berkeley on August 27.</p>

<p>During his most recent appearance, Fauci said the government wouldn't make any future COVID-19 vaccine obligatory for the general public but local jurisdictions could make it mandatory for some groups, including children.</p>

<p>'You don't want to mandate and try and force anyone to take a vaccine. We've never done that,' Fauci said during the video talk organized by the university.</p>

<p>'You can mandate for certain groups of people like health workers, but for the general population you can't' he added, citing the example of the National Institutes of Health, where health workers can't treat patients without a flu shot.</p>

<p>In a virtual conference hosted by health information website Healthline on Tuesday, Fauci touched on the issue of students returning to school.</p>

<p>He said easing in with virtual classrooms would be better in parts of the country that have a coronavirus infection positivity rate of more than 10 percent.</p>

<p>Fauci said that the default position should be to try and reopen schools for the psychological health of children but added that a unilateral approach to reopening schools could not be taken.</p>

<p>'To make a statement on one side vs the other and take the country as a whole won't work - we're so heterogeneous with the infections,' Fauci said.</p>
