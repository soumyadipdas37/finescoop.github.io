<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid will reportedly pay half of Gareth Bale's £600,000-a-week salary to grant him his wish of returning to the Premier League this summer.</p>

<p>The Welshman said last week that the Spanish club were making it 'very difficult' for him to leave after his move to the Chinese Super League was blocked 12 months ago.</p>

<p>Now though their stance appears to be softening and they will subsidise half of his wages to get him off the books, according to The Telegraph.  </p>

<p>Gareth Bale appears to be drawing closer to a permanent Real Madrid exit this summer </p>

<p>It comes as reports in Spain on Wednesday claimed Real are ready to let Bale leave for a cut-price fee of £22million amid interest from Manchester United.</p>

<p>Bale has returned to Madrid to join his team-mates in beginning their pre-season preparations but was unable to take part in training.</p>

<p>AS report that the 31-year-old sat the session out after picking up a knee injury during his exploits with the Welsh national side. </p>

<p>He played 45 minutes of their victory in Finland last week and then the whole 90 minutes of their late victory over Bulgaria on Sunday. </p>

<p>A potential Bernabeu departure now appears to be accelerating for the Wales star, who moved to Spain for a then-world record £85m fee in the summer of 2013.</p>

<p>Bale missed training on his return to Madrid this week after picking up a knee injury</p>

<p>Bale said last week that Madrid were making it 'very difficult' for him to leave the club</p>

<p>Bale's proposed move to Chinese giants Jiangsu Suning fell through at the eleventh hour last summer and he told Sky Sports last week that the La Liga giants haven't made it easy for him to find a new club. </p>

<p>He said: 'I tried to leave last year and they blocked everything at the last second. It was a project I was excited for but it didn't materialise.</p>

<p>'There have been other instances where we have tried to go but the club won't allow it or they have done something.</p>

<p>'So I guess it is for the club [to answer about what will happen]. What can I say? I want to play football. I am still motivated to play football so I guess it is on the club really. I can't do anything, they are in control of everything</p>

<p>'I have a contract so all I can do is carry on what I am doing an hopefully something comes up.</p>

<p>'It is in the club's hands and they have made things very difficult to be honest.'  </p>
