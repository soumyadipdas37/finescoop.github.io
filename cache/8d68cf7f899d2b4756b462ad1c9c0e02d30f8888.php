<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) has been blasted for the 'tasteless and insensitive' Covid-themed pint glass for its 2020 beer festival glasses.  </p>

<p>The limited-edition pint glasses have been printed with images of white virus microbes - a move that has been slammed as  'tasteless ' and ' insensitive '.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Twitter users and CAMRA members took to social media to lament their disgust at the company's poor decision.</p>

<p>CAMRA has been blasted for this 'tasteless and insensitive' Covid-themed pint glass for its 2020 beer festival glasses.</p>

<p>The design has been released in support of this year's Great British Beer Festival, which has gone virtual for its 2020 edition and is due to take place next weekend.</p>

<p>Hundreds of people have criticised the move, with many saying they would cancel their CAMRA memberships because of it. </p>

<p>Absolute disgrace: Twitter users say that CAMRA were clearly not thinking straight when they come up with the idea</p>

<p>Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>WithintheWalls was outraged that the company was seen to be celebrating 41,449 deaths with the Corona virus branded glasses adding 'What utter disrespect?'</p>

<p>Another Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>ashleymeerkat was in such disbelief she queried whether the designer was already 'drunk' when coming up with the idea.</p>

<p>Are you seeing double? This was the design chosen for this year's Great British Beer Festival</p>

<p>Hundreds of social media users took to Twitter to show their disgust at CAMRA's decision to launch the pint glass</p>

<p>The Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>Jesslionmane said: 'Uh...Well here's a short sighted promotion. Shame on you CAMRA, I suspect you will lose a lot of respect over this!'</p>

<p>In total disbelief at how such a design got through all the people behind the decision-making process</p>

<p>Meanwhile Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>Gary_Anderson said he couldn't believe the glass design had ever been 'approved' stating: 'I know it's 'only a glass' but how the entire chain of personnel involved in the design, commissioning, approving and manufacture of this glass all agreed that this was a good idea is unbelievable'</p>

<p>This is not the first time CAMRA has come under fire for its poor decision making and social media users made sure they were reminded</p>

<p>Following the backlash, CAMRA has posted a public apology and statement.</p>

<p>Festival organiser Catherine Tonry said: 'As someone who has suffered lasting lung damage after contracting COVID-19, I am all too aware how serious the illness can be and the devastating and long-term impact it has had on so many of us.</p>

<p>Hundreds of Twitter users aired their disgust at CAMRA's decision to launch the glasses which they say were in poor taste</p>

<p>'I sincerely apologise to anyone who has taken offence to the glass theme.</p>

<p>'We choose a theme every year and wanted to ensure the design recognised what was at the front of everyone's mind.</p>

<p>Total disgrace: CAMRA officials have apologised for their insensitive decision but Twitter users are sickened</p>

<p>'COVID-19 has been the defining event of 2020, and has severely impacted the beer and pub sector - as well as many of our personal lives.</p>

<p>'In fact, this is the first time we have held the festival digitally in over 40 years of hosting the Great British Beer Festival.</p>

<p>'We hope that despite the difficulties faced by many, the festival will give people the chance to come together over a pint and discover new brewers and cider producers to support throughout this period of uncertainty.'</p>
