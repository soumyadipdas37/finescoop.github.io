<p>She previously admitted that she felt in over her head, coming into season 29 of the popular competition series.</p>

<p>Heche told Hollywood Outbreak earlier this week: 'I love to dance on the dance floor. I love to move, and I love to dance. I've never had a professional lesson before, </p>

<p>'But before I got here and really learned what dancing is, I probably would have said, "Yea man, I look great on a dance floor. What are you talking about? I can move."</p>

<p>'Then, cut to, "I can't move. What are you talking about? What is ballroom? I don't know or care to think about how complicated the cha-cha or rumba, la-di-da is." So, time's changed very quickly from "yea, I'm awesome" to "no, I'm not awesome."' </p>
