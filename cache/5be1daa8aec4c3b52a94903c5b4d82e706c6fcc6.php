<p>Family:  Cat Deeley, 43, enjoyed an outing with her husband Patrick Kielty, 49, and their sons Milo, four, and James, two, in Primrose Hill on Tuesday</p>

<p>The So You Think You Can Dance star paired it with a burgundy leather jacket and a navy scarf as she held hands with Milo.</p>

<p>Carrying her son's jacket, Cat completed her look for the outing by letting her blonde locks fall loose down her shoulders. </p>

<p>Patrick, 49, also opted for a laid back look, wearing a grey jumper and navy jeans for the family day out.</p>

<p>It comes after Cat was reported to have given up her life in Los Angeles in favour of being closer to her family in London.    </p>

<p>Outfit: The TV presenter cut a casual figure for the day, wearing a white top with navy skinny jeans</p>

<p>Last month, the star put her lavish Beverly Hills mansion, which she first bought in 2006, on the market for just under $5million (£3.8million).</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Cat was discussing putting the house up for sale months ago, they didn't want to rent it out because they were considering buying a property in the UK. This is more of a permanent move.' </p>

<p>'She is a household name, and they both made it work in LA, but Patrick gets a lot more work back home, and she could always fly back and forth when the pandemic eases up.'</p>

<p>Cat will make a hefty profit from the sale of her Beverly Hills home as she purchased it for $2.7million ($2.05million), according to Variety.  </p>

<p>Casual: The So You Think You Can Dance star paired it with a burgundy leather jacket and a navy scarf as she held hands with Milo.</p>

<p>The insider added that both Cat and Patrick were 'more than ready for this' as they dream of raising their children in the UK.</p>

<p>The TV star was said to have been planning the move back to Britain since the start of the year and will fly back to the US for work. </p>

<p>Cat first moved to Los Angeles in 2006 and has presented So You Think You Can Dance since. </p>

<p>The presenter recently revealed she is 'done' with children and has no desire to try for a girl.</p>

<p>Homeward bound: It comes after Cat was reported to have given up her life in Los Angeles so she and Patrick can raise their children in the UK</p>

<p>'No, I think I'm done. I love my boys. I can't believe how lucky I am to have them,' she told Closer magazine. 'I'm good, I think. Ask me again in 12 months' time!'</p>

<p>'Being a working mum of two is kind of like a massive juggle, where you throw all the balls up in the air and you try to keep them all up there.'</p>

<p>Cat and Patrick met when they presented Fame Academy together in 2002 and remained pals for almost a decade before making their debut as a couple in March 2012.</p>

<p>They tied the knot just six months later in a traditional Catholic ceremony in Rome, Italy, in September 2012, which was an intimate affair with just six family and friends each.</p>
