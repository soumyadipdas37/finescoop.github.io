<p>The Argentine was left out of Arsenal's line-up to face Fulham but is now expected to be in place for Villa's opening Premier League fixture with Sheffield United if all goes to plan.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta had made it clear to Martinez that, despite recent performances, Bernd Leno would be his number one choice and was not keen to rotate goalkeepers through various cup competitions.</p>

<p>Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez is closing in on a £19.5m move to Aston Villa</p>

<p>The Argentine was left out of Arsenal's line-up to face Fulham with a £19.5m deal in place</p>

<p>Brighton, Leeds United and Schalke had also shown interest but Villa, with Tom Heaton still out injured, appear to have made the strongest case to the 28-year-old Martinez. </p>

<p>A rival offer from Brighton remains on the table, but Martinez was taken around Villa Park on Saturday as the Midlands side attempted to sell the club's rich history and his importance to the side if he joined to him. </p>

<p>It is expected the Argentine - who harbours hopes of becoming his country's no.1 - would come in as their starter ahead of Heaton, but Brighton have made no such promise which is paramount to Martinez making the move.</p>

<p>Brighton have also made an offer which remains on the table for the 28-year-old Argentine</p>

<p>But Dean Smith's Villa are well placed after they took Martinez around Villa Park on Saturday</p>

<p>More importantly, Villa made the offers that eventually matched Arsenal's valuation with the clinching offer understood to be £15m plus £4.5m in add ons. </p>

<p>Villa will now look to add Werder Bremen winger Milot Rashica in a deal worth around £18million.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old Kosovo international is expected to agree terms over the weekend to give Villa an extra cutting edge. Rashica scored 11 goals in 34 games last season.</p>

<p>Manager Dean Smith remains keen to add another striker too with Bournemouth's Josh King and Liverpool's Rhian Brewster among names discussed.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta had made it clear that he was not keen on rotating goalkeepers in cup matches</p>

<p>The Spanish manager also informed Martinez that German Bernd Leno would be his no.1 </p>
