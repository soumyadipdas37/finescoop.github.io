<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The former partner of a notorious bikie says he's owed an apology after Queensland authorities said he boarded a plane with coronavirus - and then retracted it.  </p>

<p>A health alert from the state on Tuesday claimed 48-year-old Shane Bowden was not contagious with COVID-19 when he flew from Melbourne to Brisbane the day before.  </p>

<p>But Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk repeated claims the former Finks bikie was infected on the flight at a media conference on Wednesday.   </p>

<p>Trudi McPhee, who has a teenage son with Bowden, told the Courier Mail her former partner was given 'the all-clear' by officials and would not have put the public in danger. </p>

<p>A Qld health alert on Tuesday said 48-year-old Shane Bowden (pictured) was not contagious with COVID-19 when he flew from Melbourne to Brisbane on Monday</p>

<p>Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, repeated claims the former Finks bikie was infected on the flight at a media conference on Wednesday</p>

<p>Trudi McPhee, who has a teenage son with Bowden (pictured), said he was given 'the all-clear' by officials and would not have put the public in danger </p>

<p>'They said he had COVID and they need to apologise to him but I don't think they have the balls to apologise to him, quite frankly,' said Ms McPhee.</p>

<p>The Premier doubled down on her point of view saying it was her 'understanding' that Bowden was positive when he arrived in the state.  </p>

<p>She then admitted she would need to check the details with Health Minister Steven Miles.</p>

<p>The confusion started when Qld Health issued a release on Tuesday stating a public health alert was not issued for the flight he was on. </p>

<p>'New advice provided to Queensland Health is that he was not infectious while on the flight,' it stated.  </p>

<p>The convicted criminal was released from a five-year prison stint in Victoria two months ago, and within 15 days was the victim of a drive-by shooting.</p>

<p>The former bikie was in Royal Melbourne Hospital recovering from a gunshot to his leg when he was first diagnosed with COVID-19, and was still being treated for the virus 72 hours before he boarded the flight. </p>

<p>Qld authorities are also investigating him for lying on his border declaration pass and are trying to determine if he committed an offence. </p>

<p>The former bikie was in Royal Melbourne Hospital recovering from a gunshot to his leg when he was first diagnosed with COVID-19, and was still being treated for the virus 72 hours before he boarded the flight to Brisbane </p>

<p>Ms McPhee previously told the Herald Sun the former bikie was desperate to leave Melbourne and was concerned he was being 'watched' while in hospital receiving treatment for COVID-19. </p>

<p>'He is a pretty wild man, he was already wanted by Queensland police he had told me,' Ms McPhee said.</p>

<p>'He didn't want to be in Victoria anymore.'</p>

<p> She thinks Bowden 'needs help' after he became consumed with the theory that people were watching him while he was recovering in hospital. </p>

<p>'He checked out of hospital because he was very scared, he was worried people were watching him all the time... He is obviously not thinking properly,' she said. </p>

<p>Ms McPhee said he made it clear to her that he wanted to head to the Gold Coast, but she had no clue how quickly he would leave.    </p>

<p>Bowden is also being investigated for lying on his Qld border declaration form. Pictured: Motorists are stopped at a checkpoint at Coolangatta on the Queensland- New South Wales border in August</p>

<p>Bowden spent seven years in prison for the shooting of another Melbourne bikie in 2006, and was said to be part of the Fink's 'Terror Team'.</p>

<p>He temporarily joined the Mongols but was recently booted from the club, Ms McPhee revealed.</p>

<p>'He lived for the Mongols, whatever happened, why he got kicked out — it is not my business. But, when things like this keep happening it is my opinion it is time to hang up your boots and find something else to do,' she said.</p>

<p>When he was released from jail in June, Bowden was 'happy' to be free and vowed to stay on the right side of the law, she added.    </p>

<p>Bowden was picked up in a limousine after a five-year prison stint for a violent home invasion</p>

<p>An entourage of Mongols gang members travelled an hour and a half from Mebourne to meet Bowden with the limousine </p>

<p>The 48-year-old made a glitzy exit from jail - picked up in a limousine.</p>

<p>He was met by an entourage of fellow gang members on motorbikes, who travelled an hour and a half from Melbourne to meet Bowden, the Herald Sun reported.  </p>

<p>He wrote in a social media post after his release and the subsequent shooting that he was excited to go back to Queensland. </p>

<p>'Can't [wait] to get back there as [soon] as I can get back X the border,' he wrote, according to the Courier Mail.</p>

<p>The alleged breach comes as Queensland confirmed two new cases of coronavirus on Wednesday, out of 18,151 tests.  </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 90 new coronavirus cases during the same period - and a further six deaths.  </p>

<p>The state's parliament also voted to extend the government's emergency powers by another six-months. </p>

<p>The new fatalities include five males in their 80s and one male in their 90s, all linked to aged-care outbreaks.</p>

<p>The figures bring Victoria's coronavirus death toll to 576. </p>
