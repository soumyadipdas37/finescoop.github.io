<p>'If you are brave enough to take responsibility for your half and really look at your own garbage and your own trauma and how it’s presenting in the world and in your relationship then there really is somewhere to go and something to learn and something to heal.</p>

<p>'We are all part good and part bad, it’s not binary, we are all grey area. We all are trying our best. I really wanted my kids to not be traumatized, if it were possible.' </p>

<p>Gwyneth said she and the Coldplay vocalist had to commit to putting their children first even on days when they didn't want to play happy families.</p>

<p>'You take a deep breath and you look the person in the eye and you remember your pact and you smile and you hug and you make a hug and recommit to this new relationship that you are trying to foster. </p>
