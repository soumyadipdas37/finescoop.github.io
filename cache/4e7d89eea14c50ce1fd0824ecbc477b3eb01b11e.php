<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sadio Mane was instrumental once again for Liverpool in their 3-1 victory over Arsenal, but it appears he was lucky to be on the pitch for longer than three minutes.</p>

<p>The Senegalese was only booked for a clumsy elbow into the face of Kieran Tierney while battling with the Scot on the Liverpool right, but replays showed his punishment could easily have been more severe.</p>

<p>The incident came just a minute after he had gone in strongly on Hector Bellerin at Anfield, but his challenge immediately afterwards saw the Arsenal players surround referee Craig Pawson before he dished out a yellow card.</p>

<p>Sadio Mane appeared fortunate not to be sent off for an elbow on Arsenal's Kieran Tierney</p>

<p>The Senegalese elbowed the Scot just three minutes into Liverpool's win against Arsenal</p>

<p>Mane's poor touch from a lofted ball caused the battle with Tierney and the following incident</p>

<p>Mane was collecting a long ball over his shoulder, but his touch was a little heavier than expected and that saw him face a fight to keep the ball from Tierney as it ran out to the right-hand touchline.</p>

<p>The forward however then made a very obvious movement across the Arsenal left-back, who went down clutching his face while the assistant immediately flagged.</p>

<p>Mane however was not sent for an early shower and was only cautioned, and 25 minutes later he took full advantage and was on the scoresheet to tap home an equaliser afterÂ Alexandre Lacazette had given the visitors the lead against the run of play.</p>

<p>Mo Salah had made a brilliant run into the box and held off Tierney to fire a shot off, and while Bernd Leno could save it he could only parry it into the path of Mane, who netted his third Premier League goal of the season after his double last weekend.</p>

<p>But despite the Arsenal players' pleas, forward Mane was only cautioned by the refereeÂ </p>

<p>The Senegalese then took advantage by netting Liverpool's equaliser in their 3-1 victory</p>

<p>The goal was Mane's third of the season after his double against Chelsea the weekend before</p>

<p>The former Southampton man was a nightmare for the whole Arsenal defence down the left-hand side, and looked dismayed that he was replaced before the end to allow Diogo Jota to make his Premier League debut for Liverpool.</p>

<p>But after Andy Robertson had completed the comeback just before half-time, the Portuguese scored his first goal for the club since his Â£40m move from Wolves to seal the win.</p>

<p>The victory for Jurgen Klopp's side saw them maintain their 100 per cent record after wins against Leeds and Chelsea, while Mikel Arteta's men saw their six-game unbeaten run come to an end.</p>
