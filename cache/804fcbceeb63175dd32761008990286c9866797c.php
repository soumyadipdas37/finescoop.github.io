<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A single Australian radio producer has discovered why she hasn't found her 'forever person' - and the biggest dating mistake people make. </p>

<p>Triple M radio worker Jana Hocking, 36, said she's constantly being asked about her relationship status - and when she hopes to meet someone - so she decided to interview a psychologist on the topic of choosing 'The One'.</p>

<p>'What we basically discovered was that I need to start going for guys who I actually have something in common with,' she wrote in a column for news.com.au.</p>

<p>Where Jana's idea of a 'perfect date' might be strolling around an art gallery followed by a glass of wine and a nice dinner, the men she is choosing would rather do something completely different.</p>

<p>'You see, it seems so obvious, but I just wasn't allowing myself to look for a proper "forever person". Someone I could actually see myself falling for,' she said. </p>

<p>Are you dating people you have something in common with?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>Instead she was biding her time with people she knew, deep down, weren't right for her long-term.</p>

<p>Many people unknowingly do this, Jana said, and pay the price of being single for lengthy periods of time.</p>

<p>While everyone else seems to be concerned about Jana's age and status, upon reflection she's actually happy where she is, sans man.</p>

<p>'I think it's because at this current moment in my life I just feel really fulfilled. I have a ridiculously loving group of (slightly mad but also switched-on) friends, I have a job I've worked hard for, I like my little cosy home, and the bloke who fits into this old life of mine, will have to be pretty darn fab,' she said.</p>

<p>Jana's working day starts at 4am five days a week on breakfast radio, so she's more than happy to keep her weekends free of drama and kids for a little while longer.  </p>

<p>She has previously spoken about the importance of dating 'more than one person at a time' to avoid needlessly getting your heart broken.</p>

<p>While everyone else seems to be concerned about Jana's age and status, upon reflection she's actually happy where she is, sans man</p>

<p>To avoid becoming infatuated from the outset, plan other dates to keep your options open and your heart distracted. </p>

<p>Other ways to 'distract' yourself from that waiting period between the first and second date is to go out for a fun night with the girls, take up a hobby or activity like yoga or cooking, listen to a podcast, turn your phone off for an hour and just 'chill out', Jana told FEMAIL previously.</p>

<p>She believes that having two men at any one time is feasible but any more is a 'juggling act'</p>

<p>'Plus you forget what you've said on dates and end up telling them the same story twice,' she said.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to employing her strategy though, namely that you could be on one date and run into the other 'date' while out and about. </p>

<p>'I once got caught doing the Bondi to Bronte walk in Sydney with a guy, the morning after I had been on a date with another guy who was on the same walk,' she said.</p>

<p>'What was worse is that he stopped to chat and I had to introduce him to my current date.'</p>

<p>Once you've been on a few outings with someone and things are looking more likely to progress, that's when you'll need to decide who you want to be with.</p>

<p>'I think you know something is real once they have done something that would normally turn you off, like farting or having a boogie on their face, and you still like them. Not the most romantic answer but true,' Jana said.     </p>
