<p>Ready to step out: The TV personality, 47, took to her Instagram Stories on Saturday to reveal that two weeks in bed she was finally ready to be out and about in the world once more</p>

<p>Her illness is believed to have forced a delay in filming of her reality show RHOCH, weeks after cameras finally started rolling again following the nationwide lockdown.</p>

<p>Dawn and former Sheffield United player Ashley, 47, tied the knot in 1995, after the sportsman proposed to her in the car park of the pub where she worked.</p>

<p>The couple have four daughters: Taylor, 23; Darby, 22, Charlie, 12, and Aston, 10.</p>

<p>Since retiring from football in 2005, Ashley has fortified his fortune with a luxury property development company, formed in 2002.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, it was rumoured that Manchester City player Riyad Mahrez was dating the couple's eldest daughter Taylor after splitting from his wife.</p>

<p>A source claimed that the football star, 29, had been on a string of dates with the beauty, after ending his marriage to ex-model Rita Johal.</p>

<p>The source also claimed that Taylor – who in the past has been linked to Riyad's teammate Sergio Ageuro – refused to pursue a romance until she knew his marriage was over, and she even supported him at Man City's EFL semi-final match.</p>

<p>'Riyad and Taylor get on brilliantly, and initially started hanging out as mates. He thinks she's gorgeous, and has joined her and her pals for a few group dates,' the source told The Sun On Sunday.</p>

<p>'They've been friends for a while but Taylor refused to go there romantically until she knew his marriage was over. She is very much a girls' girl and would never break that code.</p>

<p>'Taylor is stunning and Riyad’s team-mates have been ribbing him about how he’s been punching above his weight.' </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Riyad Mahrez, Rita Johal and Taylor Ward for comment at the time.</p>
