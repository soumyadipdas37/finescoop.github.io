<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea new boy Thiago Silva has revealed he previously had no interest in joining the Premier League because he considered English football to be about long balls and long-range shots.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old left Paris Saint-Germain for Stamford Bridge this summer and is likely to make his debut against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday.</p>

<p>‘I had never seen myself in the Premier League previously,’ admitted Silva. ‘My impression of the football was of long balls, high balls and long shots. I thought at the time that I couldn’t see myself playing in that. </p>

<p>Thiago Silva has revealed he never used to think much of the ability in the Premier League</p>

<p>The Brazilian defender has won 30 trophies during his career in France, Brazil, and Italy</p>

<p>‘But over time I have seen that it has developed tremendously, there’s a lot more technical quality. Little by little, the Premier League won me over.’</p>

<p>The Brazil defender has won 30 trophies during a stellar career and will add experience to a backline that has faltered throughout Frank Lampard’s tenure.</p>

<p>Silva is keen to pick up phrases that will allow him to make an immediate impact. ‘It’s going to be difficult, it always is with a new language,’ said Silva, who already speaks Italian, French, Spanish and his native Portuguese.</p>

<p>‘I’m studying Monday to Friday to speak English, looking at the basic terms and words — tracking back, changing sides. You prioritise the important words.’ </p>

<p>Now he's at Chelsea, and is trying to learn English to improve his game under Frank Lampard</p>

<p>Wednesday’s game will come too early for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, who yesterday had a medical ahead of his £22million move from Rennes.</p>

<p>l West Bromwich manager Slaven Bilic has been charged with improper conduct by the FA. The Croatian boss came on to the pitch at half-time in his side’s defeat by Everton on Saturday and was shown a red card by referee Mike Dean for his protests.</p>

<p>The FA has now decided to charge him over the incident. Bilic said: ‘As a manager, I should be in a situation to ask the referee what’s going on.’ </p>
