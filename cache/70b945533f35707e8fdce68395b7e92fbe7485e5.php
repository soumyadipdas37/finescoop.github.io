<p>Back to school: Frankie Bridge's 'sensitive and anxious' son Parker broke down in tears ahead of his first day back at school on Thursday</p>

<p>Frankie cuddled Parker in the doorway of her Surrey home as she reassured him about the new school term, while younger son Carter, five, played in the background.  </p>

<p>Frankie captioned the snap: 'Not all back to school pictures are happy ones. Parker is definitely my sensitive and anxious child and it all got a bit much for him this morning. </p>

<p>'There were lots of tears from him... which inevitably meant lots of tears from me.</p>

<p>'He was absolutely fine by the time we dropped him off though so hopefully he’ll have a good day. My big boy might be going into year 2... but he’s still my baby boy.' </p>

<p>Emotional: Admitting there had been 'a lot of tears' from both her and Parker, mother-of-two Frankie reassured fans that her little boy was 'absolutely fine' by the time she dropped him off </p>

<p>With schools going back this week in England after the coronavirus pandemic, the nervous feeling will be common for all parents across the country as the world slowly returns to normality.</p>

<p>In a make-up free Instagram story, Frankie later opened up about her own issues with separation anxiety, and how it felt to be sending her sons back to school.  </p>

<p>She revealed her youngest son had only been doing two hours in school for the past couple of days to ease him in gently, with her eldest having his first full day back on Thursday.</p>

<p>Frankie said: 'Parker goes back today. He keeps saying he doesn't want to go, but I've never known him to not like school.</p>

<p>Tough: In a make-up free Instagram story, Frankie later opened up about her own issues with separation anxiety, and how it felt to be sending her sons back to school </p>

<p>'Carter has been settling in well. Apparently he's been quite quiet which is not like Carter because at home he does not shut up.' </p>

<p>Treating herself to a facial and a workout after her nerve-wracking morning, Frankie seemed to ease up a little as the school drop off went slightly better than expected.  </p>

<p>Although those reassurances didn't help the mum of two, she said: 'Didn't stop me from crying the whole way home.' </p>

<p>Frankie has been vocal about her own battles with depression and anxiety in the past, previously revealing she suffered a breakdown during the height of her singing career with The Saturdays.</p>

<p>While she found lockdown relatively easy, the star admitted in a recent interview with MailOnline that she did have anxiety about it coming to an end. </p>

<p>Back to it: Frankie said revealed her youngest son Carter, five, had only been doing two hours in school for the past couple of days to ease him in gently</p>

<p>She said: 'It wasn't too bad for me. It took away any of my anxieties. Not leaving the house or not stressing about any social anxieties or anything like that. </p>

<p>'My anxiety was more about coming out of lockdown. Change is hard. I am someone that suffers from anxiety and there will be people who won't suffer from it usually that will at the moment. You just have to be kind to yourself right now. </p>

<p>'You just have to accept the rules that are being given. If you stick to those, I think you feel safe and you have to accept that things are put in place to help you feel safe but also, be easy on yourself.'</p>

<p>She added: 'It's hard to kind of get up and have a point to each day. To be forced to slow down like that, it takes a while to ease into it.</p>

<p>'I think it was hard. But after a while I just thought, this is the time to break the routine. We've been forced into this situation.'</p>

<p>Happy family: Frankie co-parents her two boys with her husband of six years, ex-Chelsea and England footballer Wayne Bridge, 40 (pictured together last month)</p>
