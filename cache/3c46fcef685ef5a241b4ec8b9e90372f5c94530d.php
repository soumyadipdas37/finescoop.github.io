<p>Princess Diana's father, Earl Spencer, previously lived in the imposing seaside property in the West Sussex resort of Bognor Regis and spent summers there with his wife.</p>

<p>It was sold by his widow Raine in 1994 two years after the death of the Earl in 1992.</p>

<p>Pictures discovered in the attic revealed Prince Harry and William once played in the swimming pool during a happy summer holiday. </p>

<p>A luxury seafront home once owned by Prince Harry and William's grandfather Earl Spencer has gone on sale for £4million</p>

<p>The stunning four-bedroom home sits on an exclusive private estate in Bognor Regis and has access directly onto the beach</p>

<p>The advert calls the Spencers' former holiday home 'a truly unique property, made famous through it's Royal connections that has been meticulously rebuilt and refurbished by the current owners to create a simply magnificent coastal retreat'</p>

<p>Princess Diana took William and Harry to her father's seafront house for summer holidays as young royals, neighbours say</p>

<p>The home called Trade Winds used to be connected to a subsidiary house - which is undergoing renovations - where staff such as a housekeeper and gardener once lived.</p>

<p>The main house was bought in 2017 by Geoffrey Harvey-Toms and his wife Lynne for £1.9million.</p>

<p>According to neighbours it underwent a face lift before being put back on the market.</p>

<p>Both homes were built in the Spanish-style with terracotta roofs and large outside verandas and sun-decks.</p>

<p>The old servants home - which was called 'Hacienda', which is Spanish for 'house on an estate', when the Earl owned it - used to be connected to the main house by a passageway.</p>

<p>It was bought in January 2019 for 1.1million by Lesley Dobbie. </p>

<p>Christina Sheppard bought the smaller, servants cottage from Raine 26 years ago and sold it to Mrs Dobbie last year.</p>

<p>She said that while she had seen the pictures of the princes as boys that were discovered in the attic, she doesn't  know where they are now. </p>

<p>'We don't know for a fact if Diana ever stayed here but next door found some photos in their loft of the young princes playing in the swimming pool,' she said. </p>

<p>Her husband Roger added: 'The houses are both built in a Spanish style - particularly the roof tiling.'</p>

<p>Set in 1.2 acres of walled gardens, the estate agents describe it as 'One of the South Coast's most iconic properties'</p>

<p>The property was bought by its current owners for £1.9m who hope to sell it for double that after three years of renovations</p>

<p>The property with sea views is one of two houses on the estate. The main one currently on the market is where the Earl and his wife stayed while there is a smaller cottage next door that was lived in by staff and servants before it was sold in 1994</p>

<p>'We didn't buy it from Diana's father, the Earl of Spencer, because he died before 1994. We bought it from his widow, Raine Spencer.' </p>

<p>Both properties sit on the exclusive Aldwick private estate near Bognor Regis which is home to wealthy residents whose homes regularly sell for more than £3m.</p>

<p>A neighbour said: 'Earl Spencer was a regular visitor to the property in the 1980s. He would bring his wife, Raine, for the summer.</p>

<p>'He used the smaller property for staff but would live in the house now on the market called Trade Winds.</p>

<p>'People don't to live in them very long and they have been sold a few times recently. Property has shot up in value here.'</p>

<p>The estate agents, Coastguards, describe it as 'One of the South Coast's most iconic properties.'</p>

<p>Earl Spencer's wife Raine (pictured together in front of their ancestral home Althorpe House) sold the houses in West Sussex in 1994 - two years after her husband passed away</p>

<p>Photos were found in the loft of the main house of Princes William and Harry playing in the swimming pool on a summer holiday on the south coast with their mother, Diana, says a neighbour</p>

<p>They say: 'This truly unique property, made famous through it's Royal connections, has been meticulously rebuilt and refurbished by the current owners throughout recent years to create what can only be described as a simply magnificent coastal retreat, set within a walled plot of approximately 1.2 acres providing direct access to the privately owned beach.'</p>

<p>The home boasts a swimming pool and changing rooms and sauna, four bedrooms, a drawing room and spacious kitchen living area as well as a sun and plant room, a games room/study and an open plan sitting room.</p>

<p>Coastguards say: 'On the whole this simply delightful home provides the most wonderful feeling of space with an incredibly light and airy feel whilst maintaining the perfect balance of a homely feel complemented with the most luxurious fitments and attention to detail.'</p>

<p>The second smaller cottage (pictured) adjacent to the main residence was sold to Christina and Roger Sheppard 26 years ago. The couple sold that property to a woman called Lesley Dobbie last year for £1.1million</p>

<p>It has extensive lawned gardens and a boathouse right at the end of the property abutting the beach.</p>

<p>The agents say: 'In all this really is a truly magnificent home whether it be for a second home on the coast or a full time residence.'</p>

<p>In 2018 Harry and Meghan visited the West Sussex town where the house is located during a whistle-stop tour of their dukedom.</p>

<p>It is understood they did not visit the house where Prince Harry once spent time playing with his brother in the pool.</p>
