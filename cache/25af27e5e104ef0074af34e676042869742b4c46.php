<p>Speaking about her involvement on The One Show, Caroline explained that she used to do ballet as a girl, as well as tap and modern dance, but is worried her knees will let her down.</p>

<p>'I've been keeping it very quiet and it's really difficult as I like a chat, as you well know, and it's been so hard to be quiet about it. I'm a bit scared, but quite excited.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I do remember some of what I learned [dancing] but my knees are 50 years older than the last time I attempted any of it, and it’s my knees and my undergarments that are troubling me most as a notion.</p>

<p>'I hope my knees don’t let me down and I hope the foundation garments live up to expectations when I start leaping about!'</p>
