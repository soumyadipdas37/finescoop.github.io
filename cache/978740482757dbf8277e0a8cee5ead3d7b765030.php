<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United defender Max Taylor is considering a loan move to Macclesfield Town.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old has inspired many with his story amid his battle against testicular cancer and is now looking to kick on in his career.</p>

<p>He had looked set for a loan to MK Dons but, despite training with them, budget constraints meant they didn't take the deal on.</p>

<p>Max Taylor is looking to get a loan move away this season so he can get more regular football</p>

<p>Though he played in the EFL Trophy and was on the bench for United's Europa League tie with Astana last November, United are now keen for Taylor to get greater competitive action.</p>

<p>Taylor signed a year's extension to his contract in May and has been hailed by coaches Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as an inspiration to the players and staff around him with the manner in which he has fought to get his life and career back on track.</p>

<p>Macclesfield are in the National League following their relegation earlier this summer and are managed by former Blackburn Rovers and England goalkeeper Tim Flowers.</p>

<p>The club have been in a state of financial flux but on Wednesday morning were granted a seven-day extension to their winding up order to provide proof of funds to the High Court. </p>

<p>They were given a 12th adjournment by the High Court after claiming a takeover was at 'an advanced stage' with the potential buyer named as Robert Benwell, who previously made a bid for Bury in December.</p>

<p>The court was told that HM Revenue and Customs is owed £188,721.09, with eight creditors owed £592,000.</p>

<p>Macclesfield Town are now in the National League after a points deduction relegated them</p>

<p>Macclesfield were previously granted an adjournment in June after a delay to the case due to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>They initially requested a 28-day extension to allow the final stages of the Benwell deal to go through. The court was also told that if the sale does not go though, the outstanding debts would be paid off by current owner and former chairman Amar Alkadhi.</p>

<p>Taylor was diagnosed with testicular cancer back in October 2018 after a precautionary scan in the summer. </p>

<p>Taylor stepped back onto a football pitch a full year after his diagnoses with the disease</p>

<p>Taylor had surgery on October 4, 2018 to remove his left testicle and a month later had to undergo a nine-week course of chemotherapy after the cancer spread.</p>

<p>United revealed he had successfully responded to treatment in February 2019 but Taylor had to have another operation weeks later.</p>

<p>He underwent a five-and-a-half-hour operation to remove six swollen lymph nodes.</p>

<p>A full year after being diagnosed with the disease Taylor stepped onto a football pitch in a United shirt as he came off the bench in United U23s' 4-1 win at Swansea.</p>

<p>He featured six times for the U23 team in Premier League 2 and was also named on the bench alongside a host of academy players for United's UEFA Europa League match away to Astana in Kazakhstan last November.</p>
