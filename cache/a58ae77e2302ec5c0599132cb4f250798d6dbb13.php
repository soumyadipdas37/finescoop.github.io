<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The AFL 'bubbles' on Queensland's Gold Coast have become a point of contention in recent weeks as more than 300 players, WAGs and officials have been spotted soaking up the sun at five-star resorts.</p>

<p>But while photos have surfaced showing the stars' wives and girlfriends sipping cocktails by the pool, one outspoken WAG has said that not all quarantine hubs were treated like luxury holidays.</p>

<p>Ex-Love Island contestant Tayla Damir, who is dating Richmond's Nathan Broad and stayed at an AFL hub in August, told KIIS FM's 3pm Pick-Up on Monday that the families were just grateful to have a safe place to stay during the pandemic and weren't looking for a free vacation.</p>

<p>The AFL is reportedly paying up to $3million a week to house 458 players and families in high-class locations, including the 4.5 star Mercure Gold Coast Resort in Carrara.</p>

<p>The Mercure resort was converted into an impenetrable fortress, complete with green mesh fences, security guards and warning signs to keep the public away. </p>

<p>On Sunday, several women were spotted sunning themselves by the pool as temperatures reached 22°C.</p>

<p>However, this AFL hub was dismantled on Tuesday as players and their families were seen exiting the hotel.</p>

<p>'I was in the second hub that went over. For us it was a really grateful hub in a way because that's when Melbourne had just announced stage four lockdown,' she said. </p>

<p>'A lot of us were just sitting there and realising how grateful we were to have been able to get out of Melbourne when we did and to have such a good support network through the AFL - we felt like one big family.'</p>

<p>The former beauty queen, who rose to fame as the winner of Love Island's first season in 2018, added: 'I was really lucky for the hub I was in, but I can't really speak for the other hubs though.'</p>

<p>'I can't really speak for the other hub': While some AFL hubs have sparked controversy due to WAGs and players appearing to live lavish with suntanning sessions and alcohol, Tayla said her experience was very different. Pictured on a previous holiday</p>

<p>'We felt like one big family': Tayla said the mood in her AFL hub was far more sombre, as most people felt grateful to have escaped Melbourne's impending stage four lockdown at the time</p>

<p>Players from 14 teams and their families moved to luxury bubbles in Queensland and Western Australia last month, where they have been enjoying free food, five-star accommodation and long days by the pool.</p>

<p>Queensland's border restrictions make it near impossible for anybody from COVID-19 hotspots to enter the state, but up to 400 officials and family members of AFL players were granted an exemption.</p>

<p>The Queensland government has become the subject of fierce debate since allowing the hub to go ahead, while at the same time denying entry into the state for devastated families wanting to visit sick and dying relatives.</p>

<p>However, the AFL exemption conveniently worked in Tayla's favour, as she had previously been denied entry into Western Australia from Victoria.</p>

<p>After spending her mandatory two-week hotel quarantine at the AFL hub, Tayla reapplied to return to Perth and was approved.</p>

<p>'Queensland don't have as many cases at the moment, so they were more lenient in terms of travel,' she said, adding that having her WA driver's licence and prior work commitments in Perth helped the approval process.</p>

<p>Game on: Most of the AFL season for 2020 has been played in Queensland, where hubs were set up throughout the state from Cairns to the Gold Coast to allow teams to play against one another in spite of COVID-19 restrictions. Pictured: Nathan Broad of the Tigers this month</p>

<p>Most of the AFL season for 2020 has been played in Queensland, where hubs were set up throughout the state from Cairns to the Gold Coast to allow teams to play against one another in spite of COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>Teams from Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales are all now based in their own 'bubbles' in Queensland, and most players have already undergone their 14-day mandatory hotel quarantine period.</p>

<p>The AFL is said to be becoming increasingly frustrated with numerous absurd requests from players and their families to upgrade their living situation.</p>

<p>AFL reporter Sam McClure said the league has fielded requests for a range of matters including demands to pay for extra food bills and to renovate their apartments.</p>

<p>Carlton, North Melbourne, Richmond, Hawthorn and Collingwood have copped fines totaling $235,000 for breaking the hub rules.</p>
