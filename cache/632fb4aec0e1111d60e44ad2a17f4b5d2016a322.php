<p>Police officers who gave a man vodka before he died in the back of a police van have been cleared of any wrongdoing by a sheriff.</p>

<p>Stuart Clunie, 34, was given a notice of prosecution by PCs Thomas Croall and Ross Norsworthy after they had been called out to an incident in his flat involving his partner Nicola McElhone.</p>

<p>But Clunie, who was known to be violent, threatened to 'kick-off' unless officers gave him vodka which they did to defuse the situation.</p>

<p>He was given a 25ml measure and then taken out to the police van.</p>

<p>Clunie, of Edinburgh, who had severe drink and drug problems, lay down on the van floor and was slurring his words.</p>

<p>When they arrived at St Leonard's police station in the capital, he was found unresponsive and paramedics were called but Clunie could not be saved.</p>

<p>A fatal accident inquiry held at Edinburgh Sheriff Court ruled the cause of his death in June 2018 to be drug and alcohol intoxication and an alcohol related liver disease.</p>

<p>Sheriff Robert Fife said the decision to give him vodka to de-escalate a potentially volatile situation was not 'inappropriate' and said there were no defects in working practices.</p>

<p>He also ruled there had been no accident leading to Clunie's death and no precautions could 'reasonably' have been made to prevent his passing.</p>

<p>But when he arrived at St Leonard's police station in central Edinburgh he was found unresponsive and later died</p>

<p>A doctor told the FAI that in the two months leading up to his death, Clunie was 'very dependent' on alcohol and was drinking excessively.</p>

<p>It was also revealed he was more than seven times the Scottish blood alcohol drink-drive limit when he died.</p>

<p>He had a reading of 352mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood in his system while the legal limit is 50mg per 100ml.</p>

<p>Clunie had been attacked with a sword and an axe in an attack two weeks earlier.</p>

<p>His family insisted he should have been taken to hospital rather than a police station as the facial wounds he suffered in the axe attack were infected.</p>

<p>But in a written ruling, Sheriff Fife said: 'Essentially, the police officers made a risk assessment at the time, at Mr Clunie's demands for vodka.</p>

<p>'They were considering the safest approach to remove Mr Clunie to a police van and detain him at St Leonards Police Station.</p>

<p>'Generally, it would not be appropriate for the police to give an arrested person any alcohol. In the unusual circumstances of the present case, giving Mr Clunie a small quantity of vodka, around 25mL, to de-escalate the probability of Mr Clunie being violent towards the officers and Miss McElhone was not inappropriate.</p>

<p>'As stated by the forensic pathologist in the post-mortem report, the central factor in Stuart Clunie's death was acute alcohol intoxication, but the other drugs detected may have further compromised his breathing and increased the risk of a sudden heart attack, and his sudden death.'Â </p>
