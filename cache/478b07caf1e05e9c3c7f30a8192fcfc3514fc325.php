<p>London baker Eloise Head's Rolo slices, which can be made without turning on an oven</p>

<p>'Just five ingredients and super quick and easy to make!' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>To make the base, Ms Head melts Rolos and butter in the microwave, then adds condensed milk and crushed biscuits.</p>

<p>After mixing well, she spoons the mixture into the base of an 8cm x 8cm baking dish and refrigerates for roughly one hour until set.</p>

<p>Once hardened, she removes the dish from the fridge and melts milk chocolate to pour over the top.</p>

<p>After shaking the tray to ensure chocolate spreads to every corner, Ms Head presses leftover Rolos into the liquid chocolate before refrigerating for another hour until set.</p>

<p>A video of the slices has been liked 10,600 times since it was shared on Saturday, with one viewer tagging her friend and saying: 'Next sleepover, we have to do these!'</p>

<p>Another followed suit, writing: 'This girl has so many tasty recipes!' </p>

<p>Indeed it's the latest in a long line of viral recipes shared by the British social media star, who wowed foodies with a luscious Mars bar cheesecake earlier in August. </p>

<p>Ms Head makes the soft nougat filled dessert with 230g of Mars ($5), 300g of plain biscuits ($3.95), 150g of unsalted butter ($5), 480ml of double cream ($3), 500g of cream cheese ($5.50) and 200ml of caramel sauce ($4.50), all available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.</p>

<p>For the base, she crushes the biscuits and stirs them into a saucepan of melted butter, then presses the buttery crumbs into the base of a 9cm tin.</p>

<p>London baker Eloise Head's mouthwatering Mars bar cheesecake made from seven simple ingredients</p>

<p>The base is made by crushing biscuits into melted butter while the filling is an indulgent blend of cream cheese, icing sugar, double cream and chunks of Mars chocolate</p>

<p>To make the filling, Ms Head whisks the cream with icing sugar and cream cheese before adding chunks of Mars into the mixture.</p>

<p>She spoons the filling over the biscuit base and leaves to set in the fridge for six hours, minimum.</p>

<p>Once set, Ms Head drizzles ready-made caramel sauce over the top, allowing it to flow down over the edges to coat every inch of the cake.</p>

<p>She decorates with leftover chunks of Mars bar and sprinkles grated chocolate over the top to finish.</p>
