<p>The top-voted buy acts as a three-in-one to get the result of a powder, pencil and wax in one mechanical brow pencil that's small enough to fit in bags.</p>

<p>According to the product description, it creates the 'fullness of a powder, definition of a pencil and hold of a wax' to create the perfect brow arch.</p>

<p>The pencil helps to imitate hair-like strokes through a triangular tip and fine edge.</p>

<p>The 'buildable formula' allows the individual to fill in each brow to a certain intensity, allowing both soft and full looks can be achieved. </p>
