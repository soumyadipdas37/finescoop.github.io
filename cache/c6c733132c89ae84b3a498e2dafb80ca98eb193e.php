<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sheffield United have reportedly made a £17million bid for Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster and are crucially open to the prospect of a buy-back clause. </p>

<p>Brewster's future has been up in the air in recent weeks, with the 20-year-old forward interesting both Chris Wilder's side and Crystal Palace.  </p>

<p>While Palace are reluctant to a deal including a buy-back clause - which the Reds are demanding - the Blades are more open and according to The Sun have made an improved £17m bid today, which includes the option of Jurgen Klopp bringing Brewster back to Anfield for £40million. </p>

<p>Liverpool forward Rhian Brewster looks set to leave Anfield before the transfer window closes</p>

<p>Chris Wilder's Sheffield United have made a £17m bid which includes a buy-back clause</p>

<p>The report details that though Brewster would prefer a move to London and therefore Palace, United's willingness to include a buy-back clause means they are now the frontrunners. </p>

<p>However, Palace are prepared to offer more money than the Blades in a bid to land the England Under-17 World Cup winner, but will not allow Liverpool the option to buy Brewster back for a set price in the future. </p>

<p>Alternatively, Roy Hodgson and his staff could switch their attention to Celtic forward Odsonne Edouard as an option up front. </p>

<p>Wilder's interest in Brewster has grown after his side went three Premier League games without a goal at the beginning of the new season and remain pointless following a 1-0 defeat at home to Leeds Utd on Sunday. </p>

<p>Brewster looks set to leave Anfield before the transfer window closes, despite scoring three times in two pre-season games in August. </p>

<p>Palace may target Celtic's Odsonne Edouard as an alternative up front to Brewster</p>

<p>Brewster was left out of the Liverpool squad which beat Lincoln in the Carabao Cup last week</p>

<p>But with the signing of Diogo Jota, Brewster is now further down the pecking order up front and was not even in the matchday squad for the Reds' 7-2 win against Lincoln City in the Carabao Cup third round on Thursday. </p>

<p>He is yet to score a goal in competitive competition for Liverpool and missed the crucial penalty in the Community Shield shoot-out defeat to Arsenal at the end of last month.   </p>

<p>The 20-year-old will however be hoping for a call-up for Liverpool's League Cup fourth round clash against the Gunners on Thursday night.  </p>
