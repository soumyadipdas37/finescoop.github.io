<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They might be somewhat of an unlikely country duo, but their combined vocal talents have created something irresistibly catchy. </p>

<p>On Thursday, Keith Urban unveiled the new music video for his duet with Pink, called One Too Many – which the pair debuted via a virtual performance at this week's American Country Music Awards.</p>

<p>The dreamy video sees Urban, 52, taking one of the song's first lyrics – 'Woke up on a couch, sunrise' – quite literally: he wakes up on a sofa at sunrise, in the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p>Lost at sea, on a sofa: On Thursday, Keith Urban unveiled the new music video for his duet with Pink, called One Too Many</p>

<p>The Australian crooner is decked out in his 90s-style Goo Goo Dolls hair, a black t-shirt and faded jeans along with black boots.</p>

<p>He sits and stands on his waterlogged couch, rocking out on his acoustic guitar as if he were on stage.</p>

<p>Soon, he is joined in the clip by Pink, 41, as she walks along the surf at the coastline, singing against a lovely hued sunlit sky. </p>

<p>The Don't Let Me Get Me songstress is in a silky and rather modest white floral dress, with a bow at the collar. </p>

<p>From the heart: The unlikely pair debuted the bluesy pop country ballad via a virtual performance at this week's American Country Music Awards</p>

<p>Cool concept: Urban sits and stands on his waterlogged couch, rocking out on his acoustic guitar as if he were on stage</p>

<p>While the pair share the screen at certain moments, it's evident that the video, much like the song itself, was conceived and produced during the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore the artists remained apart.</p>

<p>The bluesy song has elements of pop, folk and modern country thrown into the mix, with lyrics ruminating on the pressures of being in a relationship. </p>

<p>The video contains passages with actors on other floating couches, as they act out the trials and tribulations of love.  </p>

<p>And while Keith was present on stage as host of the awards, Pink joined him virtually for the duet.  </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Urban spoke about how he has 'always loved Pink’s voice' in a media statement. </p>

<p>'Her artistry and her multi-faceted ability to create, and her God-given talent, truly makes her one of the greatest voices of our time,' the 15-time ACM Award-winner noted. </p>

<p>The Speed of Now Part 1 is the eleventh studio album by the New Zealand-born country singer and husband of Nicole Kidman. </p>

<p>The album was released Friday. </p>
