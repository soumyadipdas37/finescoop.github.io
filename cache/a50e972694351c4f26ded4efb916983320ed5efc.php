<p>Erika stunned in a lacy off-the-shoulder gown with long sleeves decorated with white flowers.</p>

<p>The brunette beauty also added a jeweled tiara to her wedding day look. </p>

<p>'God gave us a glorious day to celebrate this glorious couple. So grateful,' Kathie Lee wrote in the caption while adding the prayer hands emoji.</p>

<p>Erika shared another sweet photo of the two lovebirds embracing before a kiss, with her hands caressing Cody's face.</p>

<p>'Happily ever after,' she captioned it, along with 'Matthew 19:6,' which reads, 'So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate,' in the New International Version of the Bible.</p>

<p>'Cody married!! Cassidy married! I am the happiest mama in the world!' the former Today Show host gushed in the comments.</p>

<p>She previously announced Cody and Erika's engagement in May 2019 with a sweet photo of the two kissing under the sun.</p>

<p>'My son is engaged and I couldn’t be happier for him and <?php echo e('@'); ?>msamerikabrown!!!' she wrote of the couple who had dated since 2013.</p>

<p>Popping the question: Back in May, she marked her 30-year-old son's engagement with a sweet photo of him and Erika kissing post-proposal</p>

<p>Lovebirds: Erika captioned her own photo from the big day with 'Happily ever after' as she embraced her new husband in a redo of the kissing photo</p>

<p>Brown didn't seem to be expecting the proposal at the time. </p>

<p>'What started as a fairly normal weekend has turned into the BEST EVER. Couldn’t be happier!' she wrote in her Instagram Stories.</p>

<p>'The biggest thank you to everyone for your support,' she continued, adding the hashtags, '#thebestgiFFt' and '#loveisthegreatestgiFFt,' which referenced Cody's last name Gifford and Kathie Lee's wine label GIFFT.</p>

<p>It was the second big celebration of the year for Kathie Lee, whose daughter Cassidy got married in June to Ben Weirda. </p>
