<p>A father and daughter were killed along with their friend when a wrong-way driver plowed into their car on the Southern State Parkway in Long Island yesterday</p>

<p>Mr Sanchez-Flores's other daughter Nadia Sanchez-Cordova, 44, was also critically injured. </p>

<p>A friend of Mr Sanchez-Flores's family confirmed the cab driver was taking his daughters to work before he and Ivis were killed.</p>

<p>The friend told the New York Post: 'This guy came out of nowhere going the wrong way on the highway.</p>

<p>'I feel so sad because they're like my family. We're from the same city in Honduras. Everybody's very sad about it.'</p>

<p>Nadia, who was sitting in the front passenger seat, was rushed to Nassau University Medical Center, where she continues to receive treatment.</p>

<p>Mr Sanchez-Flores, who has several other children, is from Honduras and lived in Hempstead, Nassau County. </p>

<p>His daughters emigrated to the US from Honduras in the last few years. Nadia lives also lives in Hempstead with her husband and three children.</p>

<p>Balcasere drove the wrong way down the Southern State Parkway for less than a minute, police believe, when he crashed into Mr Sanchez-Flores at around 5.10am</p>

<p>He said engine oil and pieces of the wreckage were spread across lanes.</p>

<p>A motorcyclist who attempted to avoid the crash sustained non-life-threatening injuries after hitting debris from the accident. </p>

<p>Another SUV was caught in the crash after it attempted to avoid Balcaseres's Toyota Camry, but the driver was uninjured.</p>

<p>The cause of the crash remains under investigation, Captain Mohl confirmed at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.</p>

<p>But he said the police believe Balcasere entered at an exit less than a mile from the crash in Nassau County, near exit 29.</p>
