<p>Kylie was feeling herself in the wake of the bombshell announcement from the Kardashian–Jenner clan that their long-running reality series Keeping Up With the Kardashians would come to an end in 2021 after airing its 20th season.</p>

<p>Kim Kardashian shared a post announcing the series end, while her family members posted identical statements in their Insta Stories. </p>

<p>'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.'</p>

<p>Kim included a publicity still from the early days of the show, when Kylie was still a child.</p>

<p>Back to business: Kylie was feeling herself after the announcement from the Kardashian–Jenner clan that Keeping Up With the Kardashians would end in 2021 with it 20th season </p>

<p>The end: It comes after big sister Kim Kardashian, 39, posted a statement earlier this week, announcing the end of KUWTK</p>

<p>Although the family advertised the end of their series as a joint decision, more recent reporting suggests only a faction of the family wanted to be done with the show. </p>

<p>Page Six reported Saturday that the decision to pull the plug came from Kris Jenner, after both Kim and Kylie expressed a desire to leave the show.</p>

<p>Kylie's oldest sister Kourtney Kardashian had already quit before the most recent season, though her former partner Scott Disick and her sister Khloé Kardashian were both reportedly interested in continuing the series.  </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'The family have been locked in an ongoing debate over the future of the show for months now.</p>

<p>'Kim has all the drama with Kanye West going on. He's refusing to put anything personal on the show, and it's increasingly difficult for Kim to find time to film the show.'</p>

<p>Instigator: Reports in Page Six and The Sun indicated that Kylie and Kim both wanted to leave the show, forcing Kris Jenner to end it, though Khloé and Scott Disick both wanted to continue</p>

<p>The insider added, 'Kylie is making billions of dollars through her make-up line and product endorsements. She doesn't need the show, and like Kendall, has always struggled with fame and being in the spotlight.</p>

<p>'Filming the show meant having to be in LA with her family — now is free to fly off on holiday, or follow Travis Scott on his next tour [sic].'</p>

<p>The decision to end the series came after Kourtney's exit in March, which she attributed to a 'toxic environment' in a profile for Vogue Arabia. </p>

<p>On the town: Kylie celebrated with her ex Travis Scott, 28, and their adorable daughter Stormi, two, by seeing a movie in an IMAX theater the same day the show's end was announced</p>

<p>During her downtime between seasons, Kylie has been quarantining at home with her ex Travis Scott, 28, as they've worked on coparenting their daughter Stormi Webster, two.</p>

<p>The power couple was first romantically linked back in April of 2017, before announcing their separation last September.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the same day that the series' end was announced, Kylie celebrated her impending freedom with a movie night out with Travis, Stormi and her mother Kris Jenner.</p>

<p>She shared a cute video of herself and Travis trying to take a family photo with their daughter before heading to a massive IMAX theater that was sparsely filled. </p>
