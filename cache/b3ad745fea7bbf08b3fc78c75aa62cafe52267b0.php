<p>Loving life: Her impending court drama with Coleen Rooney has taken another turn. Yet Rebekah Vardy showed no concern as she headed out with friends in London on Tuesday</p>

<p>Putting her tanned and toned pins on display, Rebekah looked very leggy in frayed denim hotpants that she teamed with a plain black vest. </p>

<p>Opting for comfort, the mother-of-five donned black canvas shoes, and layered up with a grey chambray shirt. </p>

<p>Rebekah completed the look with a small Dior handbag and a pair of wayfarer sunglasses.  </p>

<p>Fun in the sun: The 38-year-old WAG seemed in good spirits as she enjoyed a girls' day out in the capital, with the trio making the most of the balmy weather with a relaxed stroll</p>

<p>Rebekah's outing comes amid claims her rival Coleen is set to undertake a 'forensic analysis' of her phone and email records before their £1million High Court showdown.  </p>

<p>Coleen and Rebekah have been engaged in an ongoing feud which began when Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies. </p>

<p>A source speaking to The Sun on Saturday claimed: 'Coleen met with her lawyers and they’ve told her they need to continue putting together more evidence.</p>

<p>Leggy lady! Putting her tanned and toned pins on display, Rebekah looked very leggy in frayed denim hotpants that she teamed with a plain black vest</p>

<p>Low-key look: Opting for comfort, the mother-of-five donned black canvas shoes, and layered up with a grey chambray shirt</p>

<p>'She needs to prove that Becky was directly responsible for the leaks or, at the very least, that the information came from her social media account.</p>

<p>'Coleen is adamant she is right, but in a legal setting the evidence she has may not be enough to cross the threshold.'</p>

<p>It was also claimed by the publication that Coleen and her legal team will reportedly need a court order to be able to do so. </p>

<p>All about the accessories: Rebekah completed the look with a small Dior handbag and a pair of wayfarer sunglasses</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Coleen was also accused of leaking stories to the press by Rebekah after she told in a bombshell legal document how she had been left suicidal by the accusation that she had leaked stories about Coleen and her family.</p>

<p>She also claimed in the document drawn up for her libel battle against Coleen that the stress of the scandal had left her fearful of losing her unborn baby at the time and suffering panic attacks that made her too scared to leave her home.</p>

<p>The I'm A Celeb star complained of being made a 'scapegoat' by her rival seeking to blame her for stories appearing when in the past Coleen had approved of her friends leaking gossip about her.  </p>

<p>Concerning: Rebekah's outing comes amid claims her rival Coleen is set to undertake a 'forensic analysis' of her phone and email records before their £1million High Court showdown</p>

<p>Rebekah said that the widespread damage to her reputation was illustrated by research showing her name had become a more popular search term than 'Brexit' on Google in the UK on the day the scandal broke.</p>

<p>She also claimed that it led to her name appearing 276,822 times on Twitter on the same day, more than triple the number of mentions of Boris Johnson who had had his name published only 80,704 times.</p>

<p>Coleen made headlines around the world last October when she made her devastating claim that Rebekah had been leaking stories about her and her family to the Sun newspaper.</p>

<p>She released the statement: 'It's been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account / individual it's come from.</p>

<p>'I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It's ……………. Rebekah Vardy's account.'</p>

<p>Rebekah immediately denied the claims and has since been fighting to clear her name and demands Coleen withdraw the claims against her.</p>
