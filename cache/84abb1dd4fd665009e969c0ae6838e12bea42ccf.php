<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Parents have been urged to keep their children and teenagers away from TikTok after vision began circulating of a man committing suicide.</p>

<p>The Chinese-run social media app is still struggling to delete the graphic video, which features a 33-year-old man from the US taking his own life.</p>

<p>The disturbing video, which is too graphic to share, was originally live-streamed on Facebook before making its way to the video-sharing app early on Tuesday.</p>

<p>But on TikTok, snippets of the video are not only widely accessible but are even being recommended to users without warnings. </p>

<p>Susan McLean, a cyber safety expert, warned parents to keep their children clear of the app until all traces of the footage had been removed.  </p>

<p>'Check in with your kids today,' she told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'They most likely will know about it. It is also being hidden behind cat videos as well.'</p>

<p>Ms McLean acknowledged that TikTok has been 'scrambling' to ban people who redistribute the video, but said given the length of time it has been circulating, it could very well be 'too little too late'.  </p>

<p>'Had their algorithms flagged it, we wouldn't be having this situation,' she said.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for TikTok confirmed the suicide video had been circulating.</p>

<p>She insisted the platform was doing all it could to remove the content in a timely matter.  </p>

<p>'Our systems have been automatically detecting and flagging these clips for violating our policies against content that displays, praises, glorifies, or promotes suicide,' she said.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for TikTok confirmed the suicide video had been circulating. She insisted the platform was doing all it could to remove the content in a timely matter</p>

<p>'We are banning accounts that repeatedly try to upload clips, and we appreciate our community members who've reported content and warned others against watching, engaging, or sharing such videos on any platform out of respect for the person and their family.'</p>

<p>The app has a safety centre which has access to suicide hotlines for any users who were distressed by the footage. </p>

<p>In spite of their efforts, the man's name was trending on TikTok Australia on Tuesday morning, as were several clips of young people who explained that they were traumatised after watching the video.</p>

<p>Facebook removed the video from the platform on the same day that it was uploaded, and has been working to ensure any copies of the video are also deleted.</p>

<p>The streaming service was criticised last year after Brenton Tarrant was able to live stream the Christchurch mosque mass murder in New Zealand.</p>

<p>A Facebook spokeswoman said: “Our thoughts remain with (the victim’s) family and friends during this difficult time.'  </p>
