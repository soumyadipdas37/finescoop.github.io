<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Having not sold a supercar for 15 years, iconic manufacturer Maserati has unleashed a stunner for 2021 in the shape of the new MC20, which will cost from £187,230 when it arrives in the UK next year.</p>

<p>It will rival the likes of the Ferrari F8 Tributo, McLaren 720S and Lamborghini Huracan and is powered by Maserati's own V6 engine producing in excess of 600bhp - good enough for a sprint to 62mph in less than 3 seconds and a top speed eclipsing 200mph.</p>

<p>The MC20 is launched to spearhead a return to form for the wavering Italian maker, which has a long heritage in Formula One but has been in a tailspin in recent years. It has promised to unveil 13 new models in the next three years - including electric vehicles - as part of a bid by parent group Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to revive its premium vehicle strategy heading into a merger with French automaker Peugeot SA.</p>

<p>Maserati's back! This is the new MC20, the Italian firm's new supercar as part of efforts to kickstart the luxury brand in a new merger between parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and the Groupe PSA (Peugeot, Citroen, DS)</p>

<p>The 'Nettuno' engine is Maserati's first in-house developed powerplant in two decades. </p>

<p>The V6 motor uses twin-combustion technology and has twin-turbochargers. The result is a massive 622bhp and 730Nm of torque. </p>

<p>As well as potent, the engine is pretty clever too - it has a twin injection system to reduce the engine sound at low revs as to not disturb the neighbours or have pedestrians pointing angrily at you as you cruise by. It also improves fuel efficiency and cuts emissions.</p>

<p>The motor is mated to an eight-speed dual-clutch paddleshift, sending thrust to the rear wheels with the help of an array of clever electronic systems. </p>

<p>This includes a limited slip self-locking rear differential and adaptable performance modes: Wet; GT; Sport; and Corsa for the track. These all modify the response of the suspension, steering and engine and are controlled via a switch on the centre console.</p>

<p>Maserati has unleashed the stunning MC20 for 2021, which has butterfly doors and will cost from £187,230 when it arrives in the UK next year</p>

<p>Maserati's rebirth is a major plans to push the luxury brand back to the fore under the guise of the newly-formed Stellantis group</p>

<p>First Uk deliveries of the new MC20 are due for mid-2021, with the car going up against the likes of the Ferrari F8 Tributo</p>

<p>The MC20 is powered by this V6 'Nettuno' engine, which is Maserati's first in-house developed powerplant in two decades</p>

<p>The 90-degree six-cylinder motor uses twin-combustion technology and has twin-turbochargers. The result is a massive 622bhp and 730Nm of torque</p>

<p>When you do want to put your foot down - and are on a closed road, track or the Autobahn - Maserati says the MC20 will hit 62mph from a standing start in 2.9 seconds - a match for the rival Ferrari F8 Tributo - and has a claimed top speed of 202mph,</p>

<p>Double wishbone suspension all-round and a virtual steering axle means it should be a capable circuit car. </p>

<p>The incredible performance is as much about the MC20's design as its powerful engine.</p>

<p>It has an all-carbon construction, meaning it tips the the scales at just 1.5-tonnes - that's around the same as a Ford Focus. </p>

<p>Take it to a track and the MC20 can hit a claimed top speed of 202mph</p>

<p>Acceleration from a standstill to 62mph takes just 2.9 seconds, says Maserati. That's a match for the rival Ferrari</p>

<p>The V6 engine has a twin injection system to reduce noise at low revs and improves fuel efficiency while cutting emissions</p>

<p>The Masearti MC20 has an all-carbon construction, meaning it tips the the scales at just 1.5-tonnes - that's around the same as a Ford Focus</p>

<p>While it might weigh the same, it looks as far from a Ford family hatchback as you can get.</p>

<p>The svelte body, penned by FCA chief designer Klaus Busse, takes inspiration from the MC20's predecessor, the MC12.</p>

<p>This was the last supercar in Maserati's staple; a rebodied Ferrari Enzo in the shape of a Le Mans racer of which just 50 were built in 2004 and 2005 with a price tag of just under half a million quid.</p>

<p>However, unlike the MC12, Maserati has introduced some extra drama in the shape of butterfly doors - because you only achieve supercar status is the door open upwards and not out.</p>

<p>The rest of the design is utterly sumptuous. </p>

<p>The front end has a low and gaping grille, huge air intakes below the LED lights. These funnel the air out from behind the front wheel arches and down the side of the heavily-straked profile.</p>

<p>At the back, the rear haunches are complimented by narrow LED lights strips below a reserved spoiler. Twin exhausts sit within a well-proportioned diffuser and the V6 motor can be ogled through the glass screen. </p>

<p>Marginally longer than the rival Ferrari and McLaren at 4.559mm, Masrati says it is aimed more towards GT customers</p>

<p>Despite the racy looks, Maserati has equipped the MC20 with 150-litres of luggage space split between a compartment at the back (100 litres) and the front (50 litres)</p>

<p>The svelte body, penned by FCA chief designer Klaus Busse, takes inspiration from the MC20's predecessor, the MC12</p>

<p>The Maserati MC12 was produced between 2004 and 2005. Just 50 examples were built for the road. The MC12 was a rebodied version of the Ferrari Enzo supercar. The design was based on Le Mans endurance race cars</p>

<p>Marginally longer than the rival Ferrari and McLaren at 4.559mm, Masrati says it is aimed more towards GT customers than those looking for a fire-breathing sports car, and for that reason has provided 150-litres of luggage space split between a compartment at the back (100 litres) and the front (50 litres).</p>

<p>Inside, the cabin is both simple but packed with tech. It's trimmed in carbon fibre and has a pair of 10-inch screens – one in front of the driver and one for the dashboard. The latter can be controlled using a dial in the centre console.</p>

<p>It has onboard Wi-Fi, wireless smartphone charging, compatibility with Amazon Alexa and an app for the car you can connect to with your phone or smartwatch.</p>

<p>Priced at £187,230 and first UK deliveries arriving in mid-2021, it will undercut the Ferrari F8 Tributo and McLaren 720S and will be the first in the Modena firm's parade of new vehicles planned between now and 2023 - including an electric version of the MC20.</p>

<p>The cabin is simple but packed with tech. It's trimmed in carbon fibre and has a pair of 10-inch screens</p>

<p>The first of these 10-inch screen is the instrument cluster located behind the steering wheel to display the speedometer, rev counter, odometer, driving mode, gear selection, temperature and fuel gauge. Sat nav instructions also appear here</p>

<p>The second screen looks like a compact tablet fitted horizontally in the dashboard. It is controlled using a dial in the centre console</p>

<p>It has onboard Wi-Fi, wireless smartphone charging, compatibility with Amazon Alexa and an app for the car you can connect to with your phone or smartwatch</p>

<p>It is all part of a plan to push the luxury brand back to the fore under the guise of the newly-formed Stellantis group - a planned merger of FCA and PSA. </p>

<p>The joint portfolio has no other global luxury brand besides top-of-the-line Jeep and Ram truck models that sell for luxury vehicle prices in North America.</p>

<p>PSA Chief Executive Carlos Tavares, who will head Stellantis, has said he sees no need to scrap any brands after the merger.</p>

<p>'I can imagine Tavares actually being quite keen on having the likes of Maserati as part of the wider group,' IHS Markit analyst Ian Fletcher said.</p>

<p>Mike Manley, Fiat Chrysler CEO, has been investing in Maserati despite the brand's poor performance</p>

<p>Fiat Chrysler CEO Mike Manley has been investing in Maserati despite the brand's poor performance. The brand had a €199 million ($235 million) operating loss last year, as shipments plunged 45 per cent worldwide.</p>

<p>In the second quarter, hard hit by the Covid-19 epidemic, Maserati's operating loss totaled €99 million, deliveries fell by 52 per cent, and margins shrank 53.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Still, Manley has stuck to a multi-year plan to resurrect the brand, which would give Fiat Chrysler a foothold in the lucrative global luxury vehicle segment if the company can find the right combination of style, technology and performance to compete against Tesla, the German luxury brands and Ferrari.</p>

<p>FCA said last year Maserati would get a significant portion of €5 billion planned for investment in Italy through 2021.</p>

<p>'We're now getting to the point where those investments will begin to hit the marketplace,' Manley said in July. </p>

<p>'My expectation ... is that we'll begin to see some solid progress on that front in Q4, which will continue as we get through to 2021.'</p>

<p>Maserati earlier this year issued a hybrid version of its Ghibli saloon, and plans to launch between 2021 and 2022 a new SUV and redesigned GranTurismo and GranCabrio models, the brand's first full-electric cars. It has also promised Level 3 autonomous driving - which could be legal to use on British motorways from next year - before 2024.</p>
