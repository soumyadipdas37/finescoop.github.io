<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Controversy flared on the main court of Roland Garros on Tuesday, but although Novak Djokovic was on the schedule there, he had nothing to do it.</p>

<p>The issue came in the match before his, when Kristina Mladenovic looked poised to take the first set against Germany’s Laura Siegemund.</p>

<p>Mladenovic had set point at 5-1 when her opponent scooped up a shot that had clearly bounced twice, only for umpire Eva Asderaki to allow play to continue.</p>

<p>Kristina Mladenovic was winning but went on to lose the match after a bizarre umpire decision</p>

<p>Laura Siegemund returned a shot that had bounced twice, but play was allowed to continue</p>

<p>The French player lost the point and went on to concede the next six games, and then the match — 7-5, 6-3.</p>

<p>It concluded a difficult month for Mladenovic, who was locked in her room for eight days at the US Open for associating with Benoit Paire, who had tested positive for Covid-19. </p>

<p>‘Siegemund would have been the most fair player on the tour if she had conceded the point. Unfortunately, she didn’t and I didn’t expect her to do it,’ said Mladenovic.</p>

<p>Siegemund responded that she had been running flat out when it happened, and that it was the umpire’s responsibility. </p>

<p>Djokovic made an imperious start as he beat Sweden’s Mikael Ymer 6-0, 6-2, 6-3. </p>
