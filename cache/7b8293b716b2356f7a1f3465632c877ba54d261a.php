<p>A triplane, bearing RAF insignia, is said to have spun out of control and hurtled nose down into Sywell aerodrome in Northamptonshire.</p>

<p>It is understood that a practice display was being held before the tragedy unfolded.</p>

<p>A pilot told MailOnline: 'The whole airfield has been closed down.</p>

<p>'There were German biplanes and triplanes bearing the Iron Cross insignia battling it out with their British rivals when the British plane crashed.</p>

<p>'Some of the planes are replicas, some are originals which have been lovingly restored.'</p>

<p>The flyers are a group of enthusiasts who formed The Great War display team.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Northamptonshire Police said: 'We were called about it at 11.50am and are working with other emergency services at the scene including Fire, EMAS and the Air Ambulance.</p>

<p>'One person (the pilot) is currently being treated at the scene for their injuries.' </p>
