<p>Her sultry post comes after it was revealed last week that her new man is 'playboy' Morad Izemrane, who was arrested for allegedly stealing a Rolex from a woman he had a tryst with. </p>

<p>Arabella was first spotted packing on the PDA with Izemrane, 35, in Ibiza toward the end of August, just weeks after going public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.</p>

<p>And, as well as unveiling Izemrane's identity, The Sun has also reported that he was arrested for stealing a pricey timepiece from a woman he had a tryst with in a toilet.</p>

<p>According to the publication, he was arrested on accusations of 'affectionate theft' against the Italian woman when attempting to fly from Ibiza to Palma the next day.  </p>

<p>The case against Izemrane - who previously dated Dutch model Estelle Cruyff, 41, who is the ex-wife of former Chelsea ace Ruud Gullit and niece of late soccer legend Johann Cruyff - remains as yet unresolved.</p>

<p>Ex: The blonde was said to have been on cloud nine ever since embarking on her relationship with musician Josh Newsham in July (pictured). However, the romance was short-lived</p>

<p>According to The Sun, the way Arabella and Izemrane met is just as astonishing, with a source saying: 'She was seeing a rich guy called Mark and they were out at a party when his friend Mojo turned up with a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>'Later that evening she took off with Mojo in his Ferrari, leaving her boyfriend Mark behind. That's how they met. It was pretty shocking. They've been together ever since. Arabella likes a good time and hasn't looked back.'  </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for Arabella Chi for comment. </p>

<p>Break-up: The model moved in with fellow Love Island alum Harley Brash, 21, following her split from Wes Nelson, 22 (pictured in November)</p>

<p>Her new romance may come as a surprise to fans, as things appeared to be hotting up with Josh just a few weeks ago.  </p>
