<p>Chelsea are seeking to raise funds for two more signings after splashing out on Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva. </p>

<p>Kante is keen to add a sixth Premier League player to his squad.</p>

<p>He last year signed Romelu Lukaku, Christian Eriksen, Ashley Young, Victor Moses and Alexis Sanchez. </p>

<p>And the move has seen Inter drop their interest in Sandro Tonali, opening the door for the Brescia midfielder to join Milan instead.</p>

<p>They also need to sell in order to raise funds, with exits for the likes of Roberto Gagliardini, Matias Vecino, Marcelo Brozovic and Eriksen.</p>
