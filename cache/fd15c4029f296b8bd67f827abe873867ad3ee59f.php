<p>Doting mother: Amy Childs has defended her decision to show daughter Polly, three, on screen (pictured) but not her son Ritchie, two, who she keeps out of the limelight </p>

<p>Shockingly, Amy revealed she had been accused of not loving her son as much due to the decision. </p>

<p>She explained: 'He is a beautiful little boy, he is like a mini-me and of course I love him every bit as much as Polly. Polly has a different dad and I made different decision with Polly and it is that simple.</p>

<p>'It was a hard decision because I don't want Ritchie or Polly to grow up and say why did you do that with me and not my brother and sister.</p>

<p>'All the constant messages questioning my love for Ritchie does get me down though because I love my children exactly the same.'</p>
