<p>Unimpressed: Fifi Box's one-year-old daughter, Daisy, didn't seem too happy about being interrupted during her dinner</p>

<p>Covered in pasta sauce, Daisy pulled a series of funny faces as her mum filmed her, bunching up her nose, pursing her lips and squeezing her eyes shut.</p>

<p>She then began repeatedly shaking her head while smirking, before subtly rubbing her nose with her middle finger, leaving Fifi in hysterics as she filmed the interaction.</p>

<p>'Happy little pasta eater (and yes I think she flipped the bird at me),' she captioned the video, adding a crying-with-laughter emoji.</p>
