<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two police officers are facing a disciplinary hearing over claims they failed to act on claims of domestic violence made by a teenage hairdresser who was killed in a heated confrontation with her ex-boyfriend.</p>

<p>PCs Kerry Lynham and Sophie Dennis from the Metropolitan Police face a disciplinary hearing over claims of harassment made by Katrina Makunova in the weeks before her death.</p>

<p>The 17-year-old died in July 2018 when she fell on to a knife that she had concealed in her handbag ahead of a meeting with Oluwaseyi Dada, 23, in Camberwell, south-east London.</p>

<p>He was jailed for two years and three months for her manslaughter in what Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith described as an 'extraordinary case'.</p>

<p>The two Metropolitan Police constables will face claims that their performance was grossly incompetent in a two-day hearing beginning on September 8.</p>

<p>It is claimed that, on June 23 2018, at an address in Forest Hill and at Lewisham police station, both in south-east London, they:</p>

<p>PC Dennis is also accused of providing false and misleading information on a crime report.</p>

<p>It is claimed the officer wrongly recorded that Miss Makunova did not want to make a statement when she had not been asked to do so; wrongly stated that a risk assessment form had been completed; and incorrectly said that she had refused to answer some questions.</p>

<p>Previously, the trainee hairdresser and her family had called police five times between February and June to accuse Dada, who she met on Instagram, of assault and harassment. </p>

<p>Miss Makunova died after an altercation in the foyer of Dada's block of flats in Camberwell. Police believe this ended with her falling on her handbag which contained a knife that fatally pierced her chest.</p>

<p>Dada, from Streatham, admitted manslaughter, but Miss Makunova's family believe he should have been charged with murder due to his controlling and brutal behaviour.</p>

<p>Brett Weaver, prosecuting, said there was a 'background of animosity' in the relationship and the couple had 'made threats and insulted each other via social media'. </p>

<p>Her older brother, Julius, 21, said Dada regularly threatened her with violence if she went to police.</p>

<p>Miss Makunova had been working at Aroma Hair and Beauty in Farnborough, Hampshire, and aspired to become a beautician</p>

<p>Police and paramedics found Dada attempting CPR on Ms Makunova at the scene, pictured in July last year </p>

<p>One time, Julius said he contacted police after Dada threatened to kill his girlfriend because he suspected she had been talking to other boys.</p>

<p>'She told me in [Romanian] not to saying anything because he had a machete in his trousers,' he recalled.</p>

<p>Julius said Dada was a psychopath whose controlling behaviour regularly led to violence, including when he threw his girlfriend out of his flat naked and forced her to get a taxi home.</p>

<p>He also said his sister had sent a message the day before he died saying she 'did not love' Dada but he was 'very possessive'. </p>

<p>Later, Dada told her: 'Don't f***ing play that game before I stab you'.</p>

<p>This was followed by even more threatening messages, and 30 minutes before she arrived at his flat to pick up a mobile phone he sent a note saying, 'Let the party begin'.</p>

<p>Miss Makunova had been working at Aroma Hair and Beauty in Farnborough, Hampshire, and aspired to become a beautician.</p>

<p>Speaking soon after her death, Julius paid tribute to the tragic teenager, describing her as a 'hardworking, confident and joyful girl'.</p>

<p>He added: 'She could walk into the room and put a smile on everyone's face.'</p>
