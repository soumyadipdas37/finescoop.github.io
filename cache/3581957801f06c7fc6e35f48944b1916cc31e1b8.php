<p>San Diego police spokesman Lieutenant Shawn Takeuchi said police Chief David Nisleit immediately ordered an internal investigation into the matter.</p>

<p>Screenshots of the posts show pictures of the 'Justice 4 Leo' memorial with crying-from-laughing emojis on top and the word '#eastside' written. </p>

<p>San Diego police are investigating whether Lucas posted the picture. </p>

<p>San Diego police spokesman Lieutenant Shawn Takeuchi told the San Diego Tribune: 'We hold all officers to a high standard, including conduct that is done off duty or on personal social media accounts.'</p>

<p>Ibarra's shooting sparked outrage across San Diego at the time, with protesters taking to the streets to express their anger at police brutality on June 28.</p>

<p>He was spotted walking down a sidewalk on the 1200 block of Sixth Avenue just after 5.45pm on June 27. </p>

<p>Lucas and Zaki, who have been with the force for four years, believed he matched the description of a man involved in a June 21 robbery because of his face tattoos, so they tried to approach him.</p>

<p>While Ibarra ran, he reached into his waistband, pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the officers, police said.</p>

<p>The officers said they gave him first aid while officers waited for paramedics to arrive. </p>

<p>Police said they found a loaded revolver wrapped in a bandana under Ibarra's body when he was handcuffed.</p>

<p>Gabriela Gudino, Ibarra’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of two of his children, said police shot Ibarra 11 times. San Diego police said the number is still being investigated.</p>

<p>The protests came after wider protests in the city (pictured on June 4) over the killing of George Floyd</p>

<p>She told NBC7: 'It was excessive force. That was just too many times. Nobody deserves that.</p>

<p>'I get it, one, two – but 11 times? I think that’s not right. Even if he pulled out a gun, there are other ways to try to stop him.'</p>

<p>San Diego Police are continuing to investigate the social media posts and shooting.</p>

<p>Ibarra leaves behind a 3-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 6 and 8. A fundraiser for his family has raised nearly $7,000. </p>
