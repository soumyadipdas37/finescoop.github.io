<p>French First Lady Brigitte Macron was pictured smiling brightly on Monday as she joined her husband Emmanuel during a visit to Lithuania</p>

<p>The 67-year-old and her 42-year-old husband were visiting Lithuania's president Gitanas Nauseda and his wife Diana Nausediene in the presidential palace in Vilnius</p>

<p>She then was pictured sitting at a prepared white and gold table to sign the book as Mr Nauseda and his wife, who also wore a blue dress, watched on and smiled.</p>

<p>Emmanuel later affectionately rested his hand on his wife's back as they posed for a picture. </p>

<p>They then enjoyed a group photograph with their Lithuanian opposite numbers.  </p>

<p>None of the politicians were wearing masks in the palace but did do so when the French couple arrived for their visit.   </p>

<p>Brigitte looked stylish in a matching blue coat and midi dress and was given an affectionate pat on the back by Emmanuel</p>

<p>The couple then posed for an official photograph with their Lithuanian counterparts</p>

<p>The VIPs wore masks as they arrived at the presidential palace in Vilnius, the country's capital</p>

<p>The couples were flanked by mask-wearing guards as they lined up for photographs outside the palace</p>

<p>They travelled to Lithuania on board the French President's official plane and Brigitte arrived wearing a different outfit - a velvet purple coat and a black top and trousers. </p>

<p>Later, at the presidential palace, they were given a guard of honour by soldiers dressed in ceremonial uniforms. </p>

<p>As he emerged from his car, Emmanuel gave his Lithuanian counterparts a polite bow. </p>

<p>The visit came two weeks after Brigitte revealed how she felt 'helpless and scared' after the birth of her first child.</p>

<p>She had three children with her first husband André-Louis Auzière after their wedding in 1974 and today she has seven grandchildren. </p>

<p>Speaking to the French magazine Elle, Brigitte, who had her first child aged 21, admitted she felt 'helpless' when she left the maternity ward after giving birth.</p>

<p>Emmanuel and his wife were also given a guard of honour by soldiers in ceremonial uniforms</p>

<p>They travelled to Lithuania on board the French President's official plane and Brigitte arrived wearing a different outfit - a velvet purple coat and a black top and trousers </p>

<p>Brigitte held her husband's hand firmly as they walked down- a prepared red carpet from the plane</p>

<p>She said she dreaded being responsible for this child, revealing: 'I was scared not to know [what to do], I was scared something would happen to him. He spent the three first weeks screaming night and day.'</p>

<p>She added: 'We never talk about how alone and helpless a young mother can be.</p>

<p>'At 21, right after the birth of my first child, I was standing in front of the hospital waiting for his father to take us home, and I wanted to make a U-turn and run to hide in the maternity ward.'</p>

<p>After the baby spent three weeks crying 'day and night', Brigitte phoned for a doctor who assured her the baby was fine.  </p>

<p>However, she later discovered her son Sébastien suffered from a medical problem which was solved with an operation. </p>
