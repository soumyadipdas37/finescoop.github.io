<p>The teenager's defence lawyer Mark Dixon said his client, who has autism, didn't know how serious the offences were until he was arrested.  </p>

<p>'[My client] was born with a condition that affects his genitalia,' Mr Dixon told the court.</p>

<p>'It is a condition that has required a number of surgeries over the years and it is a condition that led him to be obsessive over his, what he always viewed to be, an abnormal penis as opposed to what was normal.</p>

<p>'That seems to be the catalyst or the trigger for him initially looking for this material.'</p>

<p>He said his client was distributing the material so he could be sent more in return.</p>

<p>The court heard how police had no idea how much content was exchanged because of the way in which it was send.  </p>

<p>However when police searched Friend's home in Sippy Downs the seized laptops and phones.</p>

<p>They uncovered 2,213 images and 122 movies on the teen's devices - 186 of which were in the most serious category.</p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Christopher Cook told the court that the teenager was seeking out the material. </p>

<p>Judge Richard Jones said the material that was found on the teenager's laptop was particularly disturbing and 'repugnant'.</p>

<p>However, he also noted no previous criminal history, a troubled childhood, the offender's age and his willingness to be cooperative with police, while sentencing. </p>

<p>Judge Jones sentenced the teenager to three years probation for possessing the child exploitation material, as well as one year in jail for distributing it.</p>

<p>However, the prison sentence was suspended for three years.</p>

<p>A conviction was recorded for distributing the child abuse material, but not possessing it. </p>
