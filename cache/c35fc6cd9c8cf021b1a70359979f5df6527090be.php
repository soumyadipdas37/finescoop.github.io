<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A transgender man has told how he stopped his testosterone hormone therapy in order to fall pregnant with his husband's child. </p>

<p>Lawyer Bennett Kaspar-Williams, 36, who describes himself as being 'assigned female' at birth, spent a decade identifying as a 'butch lesbian' before coming out as non-binary transgender. </p>

<p>He began hormone treatment in 2014 and met his husband Malik Kaspar-Williams, 39, an interior designer in the summer of 2017. </p>

<p>The couple, who live in Los Angeles, decided to start a family so Bennett, who has had surgery on the top half of his body but not on his genitalia, put a hold on his hormone treatment. </p>

<p>He fell pregnant and the couple are now expecting their baby later this year.  </p>

<p>Bennett describes himself as a 'seahorse dad' in a nod to the animal whose males carry the baby. </p>

<p>Bennett Kaspar-Williams, 36, (pictured) who lives in Los Angeles, California, is expecting his first child with his partner Malik Kaspar-Williams, 39,</p>

<p>Bennett (pictured, with Malik) said he spent much of his adult life as a butch lesbian and it took awhile for his mother to grasp the concept when he told her that he's a non-binary trans person</p>

<p>Bennett said his mother has been supportive of him as a lesbian, trans and gay man. Pictured: Bennett aged seven </p>

<p>Like most people, he could not wait to break the news to his mum, Lori Kaspar, 63, who is also a lawyer, saying: 'She was shocked, but very excited.</p>

<p>'I spent most of my adult life identifying as a butch lesbian, so when I told my mum I was non-binary trans person, I do remember her struggling to grasp what it really meant at first.</p>

<p>'But, by the time she saw me the following spring she got it. By then I'd really started to become more muscular and had a full-on beard.</p>

<p>'Bless her, she's always taken my coming out in her stride. I've come out three times to her. Once as a lesbian, once as trans and once as a gay man.</p>

<p>'Every time she has been so proud and supportive. That's really saying something for a baby boomer who's lived in Texas for 40 years.'</p>

<p>Calling himself a 'seahorse dad' referring to males being the one to give birth in seahorses, Bennett, who is due on November 5 and is recording his pregnancy on Instagram, has stopped the hormone treatment he began in the summer of 2014, to start a family.</p>

<p>Speaking about his pregnancy, he said: 'In a way, because of lockdown and social distancing, I've avoided a lot of uncomfortable situations.</p>

<p>Bennett revealed his pregnancy has been pretty normal and without any complications. Pictured: Bennett and his mother Lori Kaspar</p>

<p>'No one has questioned whether I'm male or female, pregnant or not. Any announcements to friends and family have been over video calls and via text messages.</p>

<p>'But the pregnancy itself has been pretty normal, there have been no complications.</p>

<p>'I document all the milestones on Instagram and keep my followers posted.</p>

<p>'The response has been super positive. I use the term 'seahorse dad' as a way for other trans people to find me and see that they can have a family of their own, too.' </p>

<p>Bennett who would prefer not to share his birth name, never felt any pressure to take part in 'gendered activities' throughout his childhood.</p>

<p>He said: 'My parents never really bought into the whole activities for boys and activities for girls thing.</p>

<p>'When I was three, I decided I wanted to learn dance and my parents were like, 'Okay, cool.'</p>

<p>Bennett (pictured, with Malik) who was mainly friends with boys throughout childhood, said he noticed he was different when he began puberty </p>

<p>'A few months later I decided I wanted to take karate and they were the same.</p>

<p>'One day I could be a ballerina and the next I could be chopping wood at karate.</p>

<p>'That carried on throughout my childhood.'</p>

<p>Mainly friends with boys, it was only after starting puberty that Bennett realised, he was different to his male pals.</p>

<p>'I remember turning 11 and being told I needed a training bra by my mum,' he continued.</p>

<p>'A lot of girls at that age are excited and looking forward to becoming a woman, but it just reminded me I was different, and I felt upset about having to wear one.</p>

<p>'I'd get to school and take it off, then put it back on before I got home.</p>

<p>'But I didn't hate my breasts, or any other part of me growing up, I was just sort of detached'</p>

<p>The lawyer dated boys and girls throughout secondary school and began dating females exclusively after turning 18. Pictured: Bennett, 24 weeks pregnant </p>

<p>Refusing to dress like other girls, Bennett would proudly wear flannel shirts and baggy jeans.</p>

<p>Dating boys and girls throughout secondary school, after turning 18 he started seeing females exclusively.</p>

<p>Explaining the decision, Bennett, who does not have a relationship with his father, said: 'The older I got, the more my gender presentation defined who I could date.</p>

<p>'I started looking very masculine, like a butch woman. I had a vague attraction to men, but I didn't act on it.</p>

<p>'The people I dated during that time reflected how I looked.</p>

<p>'I was a gay woman and that attracted other gay women.'</p>

<p>As Bennet became more involved with the LGBTQ community in his 20s, he started spending more time with gender non-comforming people and even had a friend come out as transgender in 2003.   </p>

<p>Bennett (pictured, with Malik) made a decision to start his transition after turning 30 and qualifying as a lawyer</p>

<p>'I'd always thought the only way to express yourself as a masculine female was to be gay,' he recalled.</p>

<p>'My eyes were opened to this whole other world of gender expression.</p>

<p>'That was something that never went away - wondering if I'd be happier transitioning - but I didn't act on it for a long time.'</p>

<p>After turning 30 in October 2013, he finally started to explore the possibility of transitioning.</p>

<p>And, just a month after qualifying as a lawyer, in July 2014, he made the decision to start his transition.</p>

<p>'I can't really describe how I felt at the time,' said Bennett. 'I wasn't unhappy before, but I wanted to explore different options.</p>

<p>'I had my bar exams in July and didn't want to start transitioning while studying for them, as the tests are ridiculously hard.</p>

<p>'But in August that year I began testosterone therapy.'</p>

<p>Bennett (pictured) said when he began taking hormones, his body temperature raised and he began to feel hungrier </p>

<p>Taking the hormone every day, it was only a matter of weeks before Bennett started noticing a difference.</p>

<p>'I suddenly felt a lot warmer - like my body temperature had actually risen,' he said.</p>

<p>'I started feeling a lot hungrier and had far more energy.</p>

<p>'Every day I was working out and I could do things a bit faster, a bit better, a bit easier.</p>

<p>'It reminded me of when Spiderman gets bitten by the bug and starts getting his Spidey powers.'</p>

<p>By the time he turned 31 in October that year, Bennett had come out as a trans person to his friends, family and colleagues.</p>

<p>'To be honest, no one was surprised,' he explained. 'For over a decade I'd been this very masculine lesbian.'</p>

<p>Two years after beginning hormone treatment, in the summer of 2015, Bennett had surgery to remove his breasts - paying $5,000 (£3,924) for the procedure.</p>

<p>Bennett (pictured, with Malik) said having an operation to remove his breasts was really liberating but he has never had dysphoria about any area of his body</p>

<p>Recalling how it took the operation to make him realise how unhappy he was about having female breasts, he said: 'It was really liberating. I had this feeling that it was something that I needed to do, but I never had a self-hatred of my breasts, like some trans people.</p>

<p>'I had no dysphoria about certain body parts and still don't.</p>

<p>'But I never could have anticipated what a relief it would be to find them gone. It was a huge weight off my shoulders.</p>

<p>'That's the end of the surgical road when it comes to my transitioning though - bottom half surgery is off the table. I have no dysphoria with that part of my body.'</p>

<p>Initially still dating women after the surgery, Bennett soon felt confident enough to begin dating men.</p>

<p>Describing the gay dating scene as a trans male, he explained that people's responses were mixed.</p>

<p>He said: 'Some people were totally trans competent and had dated trans people like me before.</p>

<p>Bennett (pictured, with Malik) said explaining to matches on dating apps that he's a trans gay male became exhausting</p>

<p>'About half were positive about the idea but needed educating.</p>

<p>'Then there was a minority who were rude, asking what was going on between my legs.</p>

<p>'After a while it did get exhausting having to explain to each match about what it is to be a trans gay male, so I ended up including some literature on my profile like, 'Hey, I'm trans. Read this.'</p>

<p>'It probably sounded hostile, but it was my way of dealing with the situation.'</p>

<p>And, after kissing a few frogs, Bennett met Malik through a dating app in the summer of 2017, with the couple becoming exclusive that November.</p>

<p>'Our first date was a phone call,' Bennett laughed. 'We spoke for hours and hours over several weeks.</p>

<p>'When we finally met, it felt like we already knew each other.</p>

<p>'We fell in love pretty hard, pretty fast.'</p>

<p>Bennett and Malik (pictured on their wedding day) tied the knot in May 2019, with 40 of their closest friends and family in attendance </p>

<p>Spending their first Christmas together in 2018, with all of Bennett's family at a cabin in Nebraska, Malik had an extra special festive surprise.</p>

<p>'It was the first time a lot of my family had met one of my boyfriends,' he continued.</p>

<p>'Malik was a real trooper - everybody loved him.</p>

<p>'We'd finished swapping presents and he said, 'There's one more, you have to find it.'</p>

<p>'I was looking and looking, and he said it was up higher. So I stood up and looked down at Malik and he had a ring box in his hand.</p>

<p>'I was so shocked, I had my hand over my mouth. Then I said yes.'</p>

<p>The couple tied the knot in May 2019, in Palm Springs, California, with 40 of their nearest and dearest at a private home.</p>

<p>And, the very same week, Bennett made the decision to come off his testosterone, to increase the chances of him falling pregnant.</p>

<p>'We'd spoken about starting a family and we knew we definitely wanted to,' he explained.</p>

<p>Bennett became pregnant just two months after the couple began trying to get pregnant. Pictured: Bennett's baby scan </p>

<p>'But we weren't sure if I'd be able to carry a baby for us, after transitioning.</p>

<p>'I wasn't sure how I was going to respond to being off the testosterone, so I waited a couple of weeks before telling Malik.'</p>

<p>With his menstrual cycle taking several months to return to normal, it was not until Christmas last year that the couple started trying to fall pregnant.</p>

<p>'Once my period became regular, we knew it was the right time,' Bennett added.</p>

<p>Then just two months into trying, in February the couple found out they were expecting.</p>

<p>Bennett said: 'I had a load of strip tests and was taking them basically every day.</p>

<p>'After the second month, the pregnancy strips kept getting darker and darker, until Malik caved and bought a proper digital one for us.</p>

<p>'We were super excited, we couldn't wait.'</p>

<p>But, with California declaring a state of emergency, as a result of Covid-19, just weeks later, on March 4, the couple have been unable to share the news up close and personal with those who they are closest too.</p>

<p>Bennett explained that he and Mailk know the sex of their baby, but won't be announcing until after the birth. Pictured: Bennett at 28 weeks pregnant </p>

<p>Instead, Bennett has been using social media to keep people informed of his journey.</p>

<p>He said: 'Lockdown has meant going to a lot of check-ups on my own.</p>

<p>'Nurses and doctors have been brilliant. I think I'm their first trans pregnancy, but everyone has been very open and understanding.</p>

<p>'We know the sex of the baby, but we won't announce that until after the birth.</p>

<p>'There's something about society's obsession with finding out a baby's gender which is a bit too much.</p>

<p>'Once they're born, we will use the pronouns that correspond to their sex, but we will make it clear they don't have to accept those labels.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bennett may wait until they have had a second baby, before resuming his hormone treatment.</p>

<p>'We like the idea of having a little sibling for the baby,' he said. 'It makes sense to do it sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>'So I'm a bit hesitant about going back on hormones, only to come off again six months later - I'm not sure my mental or physical health could take it.</p>

<p>'And with Malik, my transition and our babies, I really will feel complete.' </p>
