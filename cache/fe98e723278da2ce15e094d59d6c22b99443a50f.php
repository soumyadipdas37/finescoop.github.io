<p>Her outing comes after the Victoria Secret's model reflected on the progress the brand has made over the years, saying it has opened up to diversity on the runway.  </p>

<p>Speaking to The Daily Telegraph last Monday she said: 'I think that over the years Victoria's Secret has opened up to more diversity.</p>

<p>'I think we will see more and more in the coming years,' Shanina added, explaining that the girls who currently strut the coveted runway work very hard. </p>

<p>'The girls who walk for the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show work really hard to be their fittest and healthiest.'</p>

<p>The interview comes after model Robyn Lawley, 29, launched a petition to boycott the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, for not casting any plus size models.</p>

<p>'I am sick and tired of seeing the same body type,' Robyn said on The Morning Show last month.</p>

<p>Robyn called for Victoria's Secret to feature 'a few other sizes' and for the lingerie brand to add more diversity.</p>

<p>Shanina's UK break follows her European getaway with her London-based beau, Seyed Payam Mirtorabi. They stayed in the South of France earlier this month. </p>

<p>The pair put on a loved-up display at the Hotel du Cap Eden Roc, a top celebrity destination that recently hosted Frank and Christine Lampard.</p>

<p>Shanina confirmed her relationship with businessman Seyed in February by sharing a birthday tribute via Instagram.</p>

<p>'Happy Birthday, my love!' she wrote next to a gallery of photos of the couple. </p>

<p>The Victoria's Secret Angel split from husband DJ Ruckus - whose real name is Greg Andrews - in June 2019 after just 14 months of marriage and filed for divorce four weeks later. Their divorce was finalised on January 23.</p>

<p>In her divorce documents, Shanina - who cited irreconcilable differences for the split - requested spousal support but the terms of the divorce were kept under wraps so it is unclear whether the court granted her request.</p>

<p>The former couple had a prenuptial agreement in place.</p>

<p>News of their split came as a surprise to fans as just a few months before, the brunette beauty said she was 'thinking about' starting a family with her beau.</p>
