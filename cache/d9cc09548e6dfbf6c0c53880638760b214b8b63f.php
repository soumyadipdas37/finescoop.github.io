<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Scientists discovered how mysterious stone forests were formed millions of years ago by using candy made in a kitchen. </p>

<p>Believing these clusters of jagged tree-like limestone formations were formed in ancient oceans and lakes, researchers submerged hard candy in a tank of water to see how it dissolved.  </p>

<p>The candy wore down to a bed of spiky pinnacles that resembled karst, the ridges, towers, fissures and other formations that are the hallmark of eroded limestone in the stone forests. </p>

<p>The experiment also showed that the dissolving created a flow around the points, which is similar to the ancient waters surrounding the rocks that sharpened them to the ultra-sharp tips. </p>

<p>Stone forests, like this one in Kunming, China, are clusters of jagged tree-like limestone formations Scientists believe these sharp tree-like structures were formed under water millions of years ago, and then were exposed when the water evaporated</p>

<p>According to a report in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, scientists at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences put a solid block of rock candy upright in a tank of water and left it to slowly dissolve. </p>

<p>Instead of melting away all over evenly, the candy gradually sharpened into a sugary spikes that resembled karst. </p>

<p>The researchers didn't need to create water flow to wear away at the confection. </p>

<p>As sugar sloughed off the candy, it weighed down the water next to it. The sugar-laden water would sink, creating a small current.</p>

<p>That flow is what sharpened the candy into points, the scientists explained.</p>

<p>The team believes karst are formed that way, too, though wind, rain and other factors impact their shape, as well. </p>

<p>While the experiment could have a profound impact on our understanding of topography, lead author Leif Ristroph was proud of how simple it was.</p>

<p>'We found the simplest recipe for how to make one of these pinnacles,' Ristroph, an experimental physicist and mathematician, told Live Science. </p>

<p>This photograph shows a 'forest' of many candy pinnacles that had been dissolved in water. The scientists didn't need to create flow to wear away at the confection</p>

<p>'Our choice of materials here, as pure water and pure candy, is purposefully clean so we can understand it in terms of the fundamentals,'</p>

<p>'This is really a beautiful kitchen experiment,' he added.</p>

<p>Stone forests are found in China, Madagascar and other regions, with the most famous located in Kunming, China</p>

<p>This 200-square-mile stretch of jutting limestone is a popular tourist destination and, as of 2007, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

<p>According to local legend, the forest is the birthplace of Ashima, a beautiful maiden who was kidnapped by the son of an evil landlord and forced to marry him.</p>

<p>Her love rescued her but Ashima drowned in a flood, still wearing her traditional costume.</p>

<p>A rock in the forest is said to resemble a young girl with a kerchief on her head and a basket on her back.</p>

<p>A more scientific explanation is that about 270 million years ago, the area around Kunming was a shallow sea where deposits of sandstone overlain with limestone accumulated.</p>

<p>When the basin dried up, the exposed rock bore the marks of the water that had flowed around it.</p>

<p>Other well-known forests include Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park in Madagascar, and the Pinnacles of Gunung Mulu in Malaysia.</p>
