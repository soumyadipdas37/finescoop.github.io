<p>Donald Trump staged a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, on Tuesday night</p>

<p>The president said he had been told 15,000 people were in attendance on Tuesday</p>

<p>'Mexico is paying for the wall,' he said. 'Even though they don't say it.</p>

<p>'We're going to put a toll booth at the border. And maybe do something with remittances,' he said. </p>

<p>Trump said the wall 'is almost completed' and was 'wired for every single thing you could have'.</p>

<p>As of August 7, work had been completed on 30 miles of barriers where none had existed prior to Trump’s presidency, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. </p>

<p>Of that amount, five miles are 'primary' barriers - the first to be encountered - while 25 miles are 'secondary' barriers beyond the primary ones. </p>
