<p>He allegedly told investigators that he dumped her torso in a Louisville park and put the other body parts, including her lower half, skull, and organs, into his luggage. </p>

<p>Martin then took the luggage with him when he caught a Greyhound bus from Louisville to Chicago where he was picked up there by relatives who took him to their home in Markham, which is about 23 miles south of Chicago.  </p>

<p>Markham Police Chief Terry White said Martin took the remains to his parents house because he still wanted to be with 'at least part of her'. </p>

<p>'He indicated that, as grotesque as it might sound, he still wanted to be with her. At least part of her,' White said. </p>

<p>Martin allegedly told police he stashed the parts in a suitcase and boarded a Greyhound bus from Louisville, Kentucky to his parent's home (above) in Illinois</p>

<p>Relatives later told investigators that Martin never unpacked the bags and they came suspicious when a foul odor started coming from his luggage. A relative opened one of the bags and discovered the body parts when Martin was at a public library</p>

<p>Martin was arrested at the library after his family called 911.  </p>

<p>Police later found the woman's head and other remains in the remaining bags. </p>

<p>Authorities are withholding the girlfriend's name until they can locate a next of kin. </p>
