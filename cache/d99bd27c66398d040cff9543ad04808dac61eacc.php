<p>'Aussies, we've decided that we want to own cars again,' she told the Today show.</p>

<p>'It's a combination of the supply of new cars, a little bit harder to get in, and also more people now wanting to own their own car rather than catch public transport because of COVID and also families holding on to their existing cars.</p>

<p>'This is creating a situation where, in a lot of cases, you could right now sell your car, a used car, for a lot more because the demand is there.'</p>

<p>The Toyota LandCruiser was the most popular used car in Australia, followed by the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, Toyota LandCruiser Prado and Toyota Corolla.</p>

<p>'They're the most in-demand cars right now,' Ms Zahos said. </p>

<p>'It is probably a good time, if you do have a car that you want to get rid of, you want to cash in on it a little bit, there is demand for it.'</p>

<p>Toyota LandCruiser Prado's median price on Carsales have risen by 27.2 per cent to $51,529, when September 2020 was compared with a year earlier.</p>

<p>Today host Karl Stefanovic joked that he was considering selling his $140,000 Toyota LandCruiser Sahara and buying a new American RAM pick-up truck.</p>

<p>'I might hock my LandCruiser off and grab myself a RAM. That will make me popular at home,' he said.</p>

<p>Toyota SUVs had four spots on the top 20 list of popular used cars with the RAV4 in tenth spot and the Kluger at No. 17.</p>

<p> The Toyota LandCruiser (pictured) was the most popular used car in Australia</p>

<p>Demand for secondhand cars, however, is in stark contrast to brand new cars - with sales in August 20.4 per cent weaker than the same month in 2019, Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries data showed. </p>

<p>Sales of brand-new SUVs have dived by 17 per cent during the past year as demand for new utes fell 35.9 per cent.</p>

<p>The Toyota LandCruiser, Australia's most popular used vehicle, isn't particularly popular in showrooms, with brand new sales in August 14.8 per cent down compared with a year earlier.</p>
