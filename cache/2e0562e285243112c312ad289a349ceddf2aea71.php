<p>American Justin Thomas has set the pace at the US Open following a fabulous round of 65</p>

<p>SHOT OF THE DAY</p>

<p>PATRICK REED — With no fans present, the controversial American could hardly have expected whoops and hollers when he holed in one at the seventh. But did the reaction of his playing partners and their caddies — including his old Ryder Cup team-mate Jordan Spieth — have to be so low-key as well? It did nothing to quell the rumours that, two years after their spat in Paris, Reed and Spieth still haven’t made up.</p>

<p>Patrick Reed hit the shot of the day thanks to a remarkable hole in one at the seventh</p>

<p>ROUND OF THE DAY </p>

<p>DAVIS THOMPSON — It was certainly the best round from someone you have more than likely never heard of. The 21-year-old from Atlanta was playing in his first major and shot 69 to become just the second amateur to shoot a round in the 60s in US Opens at Winged Foot. The other was also from Atlanta. His name was Bobby Jones, and he went on to win in 1929.</p>

<p>GUTSIEST OF THE DAY</p>

<p>JORDAN SPIETH — After the struggling Texan followed a bogey at his opening hole by losing a ball at the next, it looked like the round would best be watched from behind the sofa given his recent woes. But whatever else he has lost the 27-year-old is still fighting and he got back to level par before another gut-wrenching double bogey. He came back with a birdie on his way to a 73. Great to see him still smiling walking off the 18th.</p>

<p>START OF THE DAY </p>

<p>EDUARD ROUSAUD — What a day for the amateurs, who are always such a part of the story at a US Open. The 20-year-old from Barcelona (right) made a start to his first major that he will never forget. A wonderful drive followed by the perfect approach that went in for an eagle two. In a blog on the eve of the event, he said he hoped to be able to ‘report back with some interesting things’. It is safe to say that opening hole qualified.</p>
