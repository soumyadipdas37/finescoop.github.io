<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Russian dissident Alexei Navalny could have had poison sprinkled in his underwear, according to the scientist who invented the nerve agent Novichok. </p>

<p>Navalny remains in a coma in a Berlin hospital nearly two weeks after collapsing on a plane in Siberia in what German medics suspect was a poisoning. </p>

<p>Friends of the Putin critic have suggested his tea was spiked in an airport cafe, but former Soviet scientist Vladimir Uglev said assassins could have sprinkled a deadly toxin on his socks or underwear. </p>

<p>Uglev, 73, said Russian secret service operatives could have broken into Navalny's hotel in Tomsk to leave a minuscule drop of poison in his luggage. </p>

<p>The Kremlin has dismissed suggestions that it was behind the poisoning and has tried to cast doubt on the findings by German doctors. </p>

<p>Uglev said a dose of toxin less than one-thirtieth the size of a drop of water might have been enough to poison Navalny.    </p>

<p>But the West will never identify which out of 'scores' of possible poisons was used, he predicted.</p>

<p>'They put this substance on his underwear, his underpants, socks, or his undershirt, and that was it,' said the retired scientist. </p>

<p>'In the morning Alexei woke up, showered, got dressed and went to the airport.</p>

<p>'And since the substance acts slower via the skin than say through the digestive system, time passed [before it had an impact].'</p>

<p>Uglev has previously spoken of his role in creating Novichok, the nerve agent believed to have been used to poison Sergei and Yulia Skripal in Salisbury. </p>

<p>Russia also denies involvement in the Skripal plot, but the suspects in the 2018 assassination attempt have been linked to the GRU intelligence service. </p>

<p>Uglev 'categorically' denied that Novichok was used to hit Navalny, saying that more people would have suffered poisoning if it had been. </p>

<p>Navalny fell ill on August 20 just moments after posing for a picture with admirers on a scheduled flight from Tomsk to Moscow.   </p>

<p>The aircraft made an emergency landing in Omsk and was initially taken to hospital in the Siberian city. </p>

<p>The following weekend he was transferred to Berlin, where doctors are treating him with the antidote atropine. </p>

<p>Berlin's Charite hospital said last week that clinical tests 'indicate poisoning with a substance from the group of cholinesterase inhibitors', which are used in medicines and insecticides but also in nerve agents. </p>

<p>'The specific substance involved remains unknown, and a further series of comprehensive testing has been initiated,' the hospital said. </p>

<p>Navalny arrives at Berlin's Tegel Airport last Saturday after he was airlifted from Russia. He remains in a medically induced coma at the German hospital</p>

<p>Alexei Navalny, pictured with his wife Yulia, has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for years </p>

<p>German medics have asked for assistance from authorities in the UK and Bulgaria, both with experience of previous poisonings. </p>

<p>But Uglev believes the poison will never be identified, and that the Russians will have destroyed the clothes he was wearing.</p>

<p>'Speaking about the quantity of the poison that was needed - it's one to two milligrams, or approximately a 1/30 of a water drop,' he told Ekho Moscow radio.</p>

<p>'This is enough to poison a healthy man to death.</p>

<p>'I think that specialists working in the Charite clinic would have been unable to detect how the substance got into his system even two days after it happened.</p>

<p>'If it was applied on his underwear and therefore the substance was going through his skin…he was definitely washed, and the clothes he was wearing, we will never see them again.</p>

<p>'No-one will ever say where these clothes are, most likely they were burned long ago.' </p>

<p>Uglev said: 'He must have been washed and disinfected. Moreover remember there were claims that he posed danger to people around him.</p>

<p>'This is what was said at a hospital where he was brought…. it didn't need to be novichok to pose a threat to people around him.</p>

<p>'Any poisonous substance once on the skin or clothes might pose a threat to others.</p>

<p>'There are scores of such substances… so the possibility that they will detect the substance and the way it got into him has gone a long time ago.' </p>

<p>Navalny's allies have pointed the finger at Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) after the opposition leader fell ill, but the Kremlin has dismissed the claims </p>

<p>Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday rejected claims that Russia was failing to investigate how Navalny fell into a coma.</p>

<p>'We are being accused of not investigating this situation. This is not true,' he said.</p>

<p>'Starting the very day this happened, our Interior Ministry initiated pre-investigative inspections.'</p>

<p>A full probe would begin once it is determined what happened, he said, while adding that German medics were also uncertain how Navalny became sick.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Russian prosecutors have asked Germany to provide Navalny's biomaterial for investigations.</p>

<p>Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. </p>

<p>He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. </p>

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia's arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.   </p>
