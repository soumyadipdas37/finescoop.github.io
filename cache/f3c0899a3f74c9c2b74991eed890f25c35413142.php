<p>Fun day: The second image showed Bear enjoying lunch outside after a swim, with his hair loose around him</p>

<p>She said: 'One time my son was made fun of by other kids because his hair on a bus ride to surf camp. After he returned and told me, I thought he would want to cut it for a haircut appointment we had already scheduled the next day, but when we showed up, he said "please give me a trim so I can grow it to my waist." That's my boy!'</p>

<p>'He knows who he is. He loves his hair and chooses to have it long. Mama and Papa aren't going to stop him from being him. He's beautiful and we love his hair! We would never impose any social idea about what hair on a boy or girl should look like. We should all try to embrace our children and who they choose to be without any judgement!'</p>

<p>The Clueless star added: 'Plus there are so many very handsome men who have long hair Brad Pitt... Harry Styles... Jason Momoa... even Jesus... all long hair! Just sayin,' as she used the hashtags #family #love.</p>

<p>Her post comes after she recently celebrated 25 years since starring in the iconic movie Clueless as Cher Horowitz.</p>

<p>In the new issue of Vogue magazine, the blonde beauty looked back at the movie that changed her life.</p>

<p>The demands were intense on the young star, who was only 17-years-old when she filmed the cult classic, which was based on Jane Austen's Emma. One of the things that was not easy was wearing 64 different outfits, she told the fashion bible. </p>

<p>A favorite: Earlier this month, Alicia is celebrating the 25th anniversary of her hit film Clueless. And in the new issue of Vogue magazine, the blonde beauty looked back at the movie that changed her life</p>

<p>A lot of clothes: The demands were intense on the young star, who was only 17-years-old when she filmed the classic. One of the things that was not easy was wearing 64 different outfits, she told the fashion bible</p>

<p>'I was the lead in this and I had sixty-four costume changes, so I didn't have a life,' said the star.</p>

<p>'I left every fitting thinking Oh my God, this is hell. I knew it was my job but I would just go Do we HAVE to try on another outfit?</p>

<p>'Don't get me wrong I was very professional and would totally do my job. I'd just stand there for hours and let them dress me up like a doll. But I didn't quite get it.'</p>

<p>Also, there was not a lot of bonding.</p>

<p>'All the actors would come and go, which is the fun way of making a movie. You come in, you do your thing, and you leave,' said Alicia.</p>

<p>'But I was there alllllllllllll the time, so for me it was very much a job. No part of it felt very social....'</p>

<p>As far as her other cast members, she said Paul Rudd was most like his character.</p>

<p>'He's just a good guy who's smart and lovable and all those good things that make up Josh. Brittany Murphy was not like Tai. I don't know Stacey Dash well enough to say for certain whether she's like Dionne, but I'm guessing not much.'</p>

<p>And the actress admitted she was clueless when it came to the street slang used by her character.</p>

<p>She said: 'Most of the time I didn't even know what Cher was talking about. Most of the dialogue was a different language.</p>

<p>'Amy [Heckerling, writer and director] knew all the street words and had her finger on the pulse of the latest underground everything. I was the exact opposite and knew nothing.'  </p>

<p>Doll Alicia: 'Don't get me wrong I was very professional and would totally do my job. I'd just stand there for hours and let them dress me up like a doll. But I didn't quite get it,' she added</p>
