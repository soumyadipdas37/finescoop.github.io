<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Does county cricket favour the privileged classes? As someone from a state school, it’s a question I have often asked.</p>

<p>In a sense it does, because most of its players come from private schools. They are the ones with great facilities. Most state ones don’t have any.</p>

<p>And it’s why I got involved with the London Schools Cricket Association two years ago — to provide youngsters of all backgrounds with an equal chance. Monte Lynch, my fellow head coach, and I believe there has been a lot of talent from different communities that simply hasn’t been given an opportunity. To us, everyone has a right to try to play cricket.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t for Ellis Williams, my games teacher at Willesden High, making sure I played the game, I don’t think I would’ve had the life in sport I have. What he did for me, I am trying to do for kids now.</p>

<p>This summer we had around 800 kids at trials, with a healthy number of Asian cricketers, but not as many as I had anticipated from the black community.</p>

<p>When I first started playing county cricket, and for England soon afterwards, in the Eighties there were a lot of black cricketers. The million-dollar question is why the numbers have gone down so drastically.</p>

<p>Back then, the West Indies were a powerful cricket side. You admired them. They inspired you. I wanted to be like them, really. In more recent years, have there been fewer role models for black children?</p>

<p>Personally, I always felt it was hard for me as a state schoolboy moving into a system like county cricket. I was always trying to prove myself. Obstacles were in my way. Was there racism? Yes, absolutely. But I didn’t feel I could cry out through fear of being called a troublemaker.</p>

<p>I experienced some horrendous things and the support wasn’t there. I went through them on my own. Things were said and done that destroyed me, but I never felt secure enough to share them. That is what’s made me so passionate about this. To make things better.</p>

<p>I try not to look at the negatives because I’ve dealt with my life experiences in my own way.</p>

<p>What concerns me most, though, is that things I went through 30-odd years ago might be happening in 2020. I hope that’s not the case because, from what I have seen through the terrific support they have given to the schools programme, the ECB want to improve things — I can’t fault them at all.</p>

<p>They know there’s been a problem and they’re trying to rectify it.</p>

<p>I don’t care what colour you are, where you are from, private school, state school. I just want to give you the opportunity to play cricket. That’s what I am really passionate about.</p>

<p>I want to get away from that private club mentality. </p>

<p>It should be a game for all, where everyone gets a fair go.</p>

<p>If you don’t treat people properly, they will walk away.</p>
