<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A stylist has sparked a rush on $25 high-waisted trousers from Kmart that look almost identical to a designer pair almost 12 times the price.</p>

<p>Sydney fashion blogger Angel Perez, who posts on Instagram as 'Styling Mum and Bub', caught followers' attention in early September when she shared a series of outfit photos featuring the discount store's cream coloured 'Pleated Jeans'.</p>

<p>They are remarkably similar to $295 palazzo pants from Australian designer label Aje, which is headquartered in Sydney's Paddington.</p>

<p>Both trousers have deep double-front pockets, flared hems and thick waistbands that sit high above the hips in a flattering style that conceals the tricky-to-tone expanse of the lower stomach. </p>
