<p>Sensational: Kelly displayed her sensational curves in an orange floral maxi dress as she left the Global Studios in London on Tuesday</p>

<p>The voluptuous presenter, who previously insisted she wasn't worried about weight gain, has pinpointed dress sizes 10-12 as her ultimate goal after embarking on a new diet. </p>

<p>Kelly is attempting to lose her lockdown weight by taking on the SlimFast challenge, with standard food portions replaced by two meal replacements, three 100-calorie snacks and one 500-calorie meal a day. </p>

<p>Taking to social media for a Q&amp;A on Tuesday, she insisted she was determined to reach her target having dropped two dress sizes during a previous attempt at dieting in March, again with the SlimFast plan. </p>

<p>Responding to a fan, she wrote: 'I went from a Dress Size 14/16 to a 10/12. I'm curvy so I notice weight loss more in my clothes than on a scale.</p>

<p>'My target now is to get to a size 10/12 again as during lockdown I had some pounds creep back on!' </p>

<p>When asked how quickly it takes to see positive results, she added: 'Usually in my clothes after a week! After lockdown I really wanted to get back into my jeans and dresses so I always notice a change when they start feeling loose and less tight.' </p>

<p>Kelly's latest appearance on social media comes after she admitted she's 'not worried' about her weight creeping up because she always has her SlimFast plan to fall back on. </p>

<p>She also insisted 'diets shouldn't be about deprivation' after revealing she spent much of lockdown preparing meals in the home she shares with boyfriend Jeremy Parisi. </p>

<p>Autographs at a social distance! The model appeared in great spirits as she flashed a smile and was even stopped by fans at a social distance in Leicester Square</p>

<p>She told new! magazine: 'I'm a real foodie and enjoy cooking. I wasn't surprised at all to see my weight creep up a little over the last few weeks.</p>

<p>'[I've gained] a few pounds, but I'm not worried. I know I can lean on the SlimFast 3.2.1. Plan to deal with my weight loss ups and downs, so I can get back on track.</p>

<p>'It's easy and it works. Diets shouldn't be about deprivation - they need to be sustainable after all.'</p>
