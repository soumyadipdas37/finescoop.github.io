<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A giant Wotsit nicknamed Wotzilla has broken the Guinness World Record for the longest puffed corn snack.</p>

<p>The 35-foot long snack was made at the Walkers factory in Leicester and weighs half a pound.  </p>

<p>It measures the equivalent of 164 regular Wotsits Giants which are a new, larger variety of classic Wotsits.  </p>

<p>The giant Wotsit nicknamed 'Wotzilla' broke the Guinness World Record for the longest puffed corn snack</p>

<p>Measuring at nearly 35 feet and weighing 0.56 pounds, the crisp is so large that it needs six people to hold it up </p>

<p>The crisp had to be baked by hand because it was too large to fit in any of the Walkers' ovens and needs six people to hold it up.</p>

<p>It took a production team of eight people just under two and a half hours to make the crisp which measured at nearly 35ft (10.66m) and weighed half a pound (250g).</p>

<p>Guinness World Records adjudicator Paulina Sapinska said it wasn't every day you saw six people having to hold up a snack. </p>

<p>The meeting conditions for the Guinness World Record said it had to be at least 10m long and the same width as a standard Wotsits Giant.  </p>

<p>The meeting conditions for the Guinness World Record said the Wotsit had to be more than 10m long and the same width as a standard Wotsits Giant</p>

<p>Walkers attempted to break the record to celebrate the national roll-out of Wotsits Giants. </p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'The team used the top secret Wotsits recipe to combine maize with water in upscaled quantitied, and then passed the mixture through a Wotsits-patented snack extruder to form a supersized 'collet' - the name for a corn puff that hasn't yet been baked.  </p>

<p>'Too large to fit into any of Walkers' ovens, it was then baked by hand, cooled until crisp and crunchy and seasoned with Wotsits' secret recipe cheesiness.' </p>

<p>Officials from Guinness World Records travelled to the Leicester site to adjudicate the feat with help from an independent quantity surveyor who verified Walkers' measurements</p>

<p>Guinness World Records adjudicator Paulina Sapinska said: 'We've seen a lot of size-inspired food entries and attempts before but never have we seen anything quite like this. It's not every day you see six people having to hold up a single snack.' </p>

<p>Wayne Rowland, from the Walkers factory in Leicester, said: 'When the team called me up and suggested this I couldn't believe it - we're always looking for ways of inventing new, innovative creations, but it's not often you get briefed to make the world's biggest Wotsit. </p>

<p>'This just proves that size really does matter when it comes to snacking. We're going to get it mounted and display it on the wall at the factory.' </p>

<p>Walkers tweeted the news, saying: 'WE’RE RECORD BREAKERS! Say hello to the World’s Longest Wotsit - over 10 metres in length.'</p>

<p>Guinness World Records adjudicator Paulina Sapinska said that it's not every day you see six people having to hold up a single snack</p>

<p>Length</p>

<p>Around the same as a London bus (36ft long) </p>

<p>Twice the size of a lamppost on a residential estate road (16ft high)   </p>

<p>Weight</p>

<p>Half a loaf of bread (one pound) </p>

<p>Around the same as 10 AA batteries (half a pound) </p>

<p>Around the same as the human heart (half a pound) </p>

<p>More than an iPhone X (0.4 pounds) </p>

<p>10 times more than a packet of classic Wotsits (0.05 pounds) </p>

<p>Many users are questioning the record, saying that Walkers are the only company to make Wotsits so they win the 'World's Longest Wotsit' by default. </p>

<p>One user said: 'I believe you have the world's record Wotsit in all categories (small, medium, weird shaped) being as you are, the makers of Wotsits.' </p>

<p>Another wrote: 'No one can beat this as it wouldn't count as it wouldn't be an official Wotsit so why was it made?'</p>

<p>Walkers responded to this tweet and explained: 'It holds the record for longest puffsnack, so it's open to challengers!' </p>

<p>Another user commented: 'There's a global pandemic but Wotsit have made a 10 metre long crisp so everything is okay.' </p>

<p>Other users have been quite excited by the news. One said: 'Please ship this to my house thank you.'</p>

<p>A second wrote: 'You gotta love how creative brands and business are getting nowadays.'  </p>

<p>Another commented: 'If you could bring back those cheese and bacon wotsits from the mid '80s I would then be impressed.' </p>
