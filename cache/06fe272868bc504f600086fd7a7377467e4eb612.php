<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fans of The Bachelor would be forgiven for thinking there are only two women in the running for Locky Gilbert's heart: Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska.</p>

<p>But ex-contestant Kaitlyn Hoppe, who was sent home on Thursday, claims there were unaired scenes that would have made her look like one of the front-runners, too.</p>

<p>The personal assistant, 26, told Now To Love on Monday that former Australian Survivor star Locky, 31, had mentioned their 'strong connection' multiple times on camera - but these soundbites weren't shown on TV.</p>

<p>Locky's brutal blindside: How The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert (pictured) told Kaitlyn Hoppe they were 'going to the next level' in an unaired scene - only to send her home before the final four </p>

<p>In fact, Kaitlyn received hardly any screen time compared to Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, even though they shared a genuine romantic bond.</p>

<p>'Honestly, we were going to the next level, we wanted to meet each other's family,' Kaitlyn said of her relationship with Locky.</p>

<p>She said they grew unexpectedly close during lockdown, and that multiple scenes of them bonding on group dates and in solo settings never made it to air.</p>

<p>Their connection was so strong that Kaitlyn - who previously dated tennis star Bernard Tomic - was blindsided when Locky sent her home before the final four. </p>

<p>'We wanted to meet each other's family': Kaitlyn, 26, said that Locky, 31, had mentioned their 'strong connection' multiple times on camera - but these soundbites weren't shown on TV</p>

<p>'He told me he trusted our connection': Their bond was so strong that Kaitlyn - who previously dated Bernard Tomic - was blindsided when Locky sent her home before the final four</p>

<p>'That was the reason why I thought I wasn't going home,' she said. </p>

<p>Kaitlyn insinuated that Locky had led her on right up until the moment she did not receive a rose in the tenth episode. </p>

<p>'I asked him, "Why haven't you taken me on a date?" And you know what he told me? He goes, "It's because I trust our connection already." That's why I was so confident, and then when I [didn't get a rose] it was really confusing,' she said. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia had contacted Locky Gilbert for comment. </p>
