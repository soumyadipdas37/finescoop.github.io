<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ask Valencia fans what the mood is like around the Mestalla right now and don't be surprised if a sharpened pitchfork appears. </p>

<p>Fans are exasperated, tired, frustrated that key players have been sold and that money has not been reinvested into summer signings to bolster Javi Gracia's side.  Ferran Torres left for Manchester City, both Francis Coquelin and Dani Parejo went to Villarreal and Rodrigo joined up with Marcelo Bielsa at Leeds. </p>

<p>The solution? A youth revolution with English wonderkid Yunus Musah leading the way. </p>

<p>Young players can lift spirits, at least temporarily, and making his debut for Los Che in their season opener against Levante, Musah did just that.  </p>

<p>A representative of the England national team at U15, U16, U17 and U18 level, the former Arsenal winger has real pedigree in youth football.</p>

<p>'The fans are in awe of him already,' Valencia-based journalist Cristian Riera told Sportsmail.</p>

<p>'He was not that well known a couple of weeks ago. But we have seen a young player who has speed, skill and audacity and he has already won fans over. He has a very good future at the club, I hope he stays here for many years.'</p>

<p>Musah has filled the right wing role vacated by Ferran Torres and expectations are high for him</p>

<p>Musah has already won the trust of his boss, Javi Gracia, and is seen as a viable starter at 17</p>

<p>Musah was selected to start wide on the right in a 4-4-2 system for his debut in the first team. It arrived almost a year after he joined the club and his debut saw him make history as the first Englishman ever to play for the club in a competitive match.</p>

<p>And it was not just any game, it was the 'Derby del Turia' against rivals Levante. If there were any doubts whether he was ready for senior football at 17, it didn't take long to allay those fears. </p>

<p>'He played very well in the game for what was his first in LaLiga,' Riera said. 'He was very active down the right wing, put in a tremendous physical display and also crashed the ball against the crossbar. He left a very good feeling afterwards.'</p>

<p>Musah's backstory is an interesting one. He was born in New York in 2002 with his mother on holiday at the time in the US city.</p>

<p>He lived in Italy until the age of nine and carved his way starting his youth career with local club Giorgione. </p>

<p>A move to London saw him spend seven years at Arsenal before the switch to Spain arose. </p>

<p>He caused chaos for Levante's left back, rattled the crossbar and made one key pass in attack</p>

<p>A fluent Spanish speaker and a vocal leader, even at just 17, fans are well within their rights to get excited about the latest player off the production line at the Mestalla.</p>

<p>Gracia, knowing the hype that would build around the club's youngest-ever foreign player, could not help gushing after the 4-2 win over Levante. </p>

<p>'Yunus has real quality,' he said. 'Despite his youth, he has shown maturity and, to endure the time he has been on the field, with the level of demand that he has done, we have to value him and to take care of him in order so, in the future, he continues to grow and contribute much more to Valencia.'</p>

<p>Torres' departure has left a vacant spot for Gracia to fill either with Musah or team-mate Jason. Fans feel that Gracia's trust lies with Musah having been left awestruck at his raw talent, his temperament and his evident leadership skills.  </p>

<p>Under contract until 2022, fans will rightly be wary of majority stakeholder Peter Lim cashing in soon enough if Musah's stock continues to rise at the rate it has since he took to the field in the derby. </p>

<p>But with Gracia in charge, Musah playing with a smile on his face and a star being born for the city of Valencia to cherish, there is hope this is a dream, rather than - another - nightmare.  </p>

<p>Fans are hopeful his contract, running to 2022, is extended to avoid him joining the exodus</p>
