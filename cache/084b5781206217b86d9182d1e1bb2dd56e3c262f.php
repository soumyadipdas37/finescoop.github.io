<p>The Australian world number 40 appeared relaxed while chatting with the Today Show, a month after their last awkward interview when host Karl Stefanovic inquired about his ex-girlfriend, Russian tennis star Anna Kalinskaya instead of new flame Chiara Passari.</p>

<p>A smitten Kyrgios' eyes lit up and smiled when pressed about his girlfriend on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Nick Kyrgios was asked again about his new girlfriend Chiara Passari (pictured) on Tuesday</p>

<p>'You got it right this time,' Kyrgios replied.</p>

<p>'She has been good. I know she's probably watching this at the moment. She has ticked it off. Thanks Karl, you're a good mate of mine now. You're back in my good books.'</p>

<p>'I'm very lucky.'</p>

<p>Kyrgios chose not to play in the recent US Open over coronavirus fears and is unlikely to travel for the French Open later this month.</p>

<p>He said he was unsure when his next tournament but is keen to play in the upcoming Australian Open if virus-riddled Melbourne gets the pandemic under control.</p>

<p>His best result at the grand slam is making the quarter finals in 2018. </p>

<p>Kyrgios' chat with the Today Show (pictured) fared better than their last awkward interview</p>

<p>Stefanovic cheekily suggested world number one Novak Djokovic not let in to the country for the Australian Open planned for January.</p>

<p>Kyrgios has an outspoken critic of his bitter rival recently, slamming Djokovic's 'boneheaded' decision to go ahead with the Adria Tour after he and others tested positive for Covid-19 while hosting an exhibition tournament in Belgrade.</p>

<p>He also took a cheeky potshot on Twitter last week when Djokovic was disqualified from the US Open after he smashed the ball at a lineswoman during his fourth round clash.</p>

<p>'I mean, we don't like him, but he brings some crowds,' Kyrgios told the Today Show.  </p>

<p>Kyrgios doesn't like world number one Novak Djokovic (pictured) but admits he would bring crowds to the Australian Open</p>

<p>The Australian tennis star reignited his bitter feud with Novak Djokovic last week</p>

<p>He also fired another serve at US Open semi-finalist Pablo Carreno Busta after the world number 20 Spaniard commented that Kyrgios must be 'pretty bored' tweeting from home.</p>

<p>Kyrgios hit back on Friday by sharing a screenshot of their head-to-head record, which he leads 2-0.</p>

<p>'We threw some comments at each other and he almost said 'You must be a little bored at home', and I was like 'I would be playing in the US Open if I felt comfortable', Kyrgios explained on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'I thought it was a ridiculous comment by him. I whipped out the times I played him before and he hasn't beaten me before and he hasn't beaten me before.' </p>

<p>'Let's face it, Pablo, he is no Picasso.'</p>

<p>Kyrgios (pictured with his girlfriend) said he was unsure when his next tournament will be</p>

<p>Kyrgios welcomed the idea of an Australian Open quarantine hub for players and officials similar to the AFL one in Queensland .</p>

<p>'I know so much work is being done behind the scenes to get it right and ensure it happens in Melbourne,' he said.</p>

<p>'Fingers crossed things get better in Melbourne and they are able to figure out a way to quarantine international players coming from overseas and having crowds would be awesome as well.</p>

<p>'It's not a bad idea for some of the big guys to feel more comfortable. Obviously they are the guys that draw the crowd. </p>

<p>'I know pretty much every tennis player I talk to loves playing Australian Open, they love Melbourne, so I guess we have got to go all out trying to get these people in play in the Australian Open.'</p>

<p>'At this stage we have to try and get on top of it first.'</p>
