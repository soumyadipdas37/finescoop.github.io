<p>Christine practiced a headstand while demonstrating her core strength with the impressive display, which she shared on her Instagram Stories. </p>

<p>While Christine often shows off her incredible figure, she has made no secret of the fact that she has had cosmetic surgery, and is passionate that people should be honest about any procedures they've undergone.</p>

<p>The blonde bombshell told Vogue: 'I'm all about plastic surgery truth-bearing. It's important in a world where there's this facade of social media causing people to have body dysmorphia.</p>

<p>Wow! Christine practiced a headstand while demonstrating her core strength with the impressive display, which she shared on her Instagram Stories</p>

<p>'People think that [things are] real, and it's not. I tell people all the time: I got my boobs done, I get my lips done, tons of Botox, tons of make-up.</p>

<p>'How I look on Selling Sunset is not how I look when I wake up in the morning.</p>

<p>'The full start to finish, including wardrobe, is around two-and-a-half to three hours. My glam isn't cheap, either – $1,000 a day, if I go all out. It's expensive to look this cheap.'</p>

<p>Christine went on to say in season one she wasn't doing as well financially so used to buy designer clothes and then return them after filming  </p>

<p>Honest: While Christine often shows off her incredible figure, she has made no secret of the fact that she has had cosmetic surgery</p>
