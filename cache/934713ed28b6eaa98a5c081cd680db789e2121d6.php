<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former soap star has been banned from the road after driving without his lights on to pick up a takeaway dinner just moments after downing two gins and a shot of rum during a 'difficult day' working at his bar.</p>

<p>Adam Rickitt, 42, was caught making a 650-yard trip home by car from the bar he runs in Knutsford, Cheshire, on August 22 - five months after he left Hollyoaks when his character Kyle Kelly took his own life.</p>

<p>He said he was working and drinking late at the Dexter and Jones bar when his wife, GMB presenter Kate Fawcett, called to say she had ordered a takeaway, reported The Sun.</p>

<p>Police stopped his Skoda Yeti car after he drove without any lights on to collect the food just 450 yards from his bar.</p>

<p>Adam Rickitt (pictured at his bar Dexter and Jones in June), 42, was caught making a 650-yard trip home by car from the bar he runs in Knutsford, Cheshire, on August 22 - five months after he left Hollyoaks when his character Kyle Kelly took his own life</p>

<p>He was breathalysed and found to have more than twice the legal alcohol limit.</p>

<p>At Stockport Magistrates Court Rickitt admitted drink driving and was banned from the road for 17 months.</p>

<p>He initially spoke to expensive 'loophole lawyers' who advised him on ways to avoid disqualification. </p>

<p>Prosecutor Lucy Bridge said: 'A PC and PCSO on uniformed duty become aware of the green Skoda with its headlights not illuminated. </p>

<p>'He was asked what time his last drank was and he responded: "two minutes ago".'</p>

<p>There was then a 15-minute wait for the test and during this wait, he said: 'I know I will probably be over the limit I had a 65 per cent rum shot prior to driving.'</p>

<p>At Stockport Magistrates Court Rickitt admitted drink driving and was banned from the road for 17 months. Pictured, with former co-star Leanne Battersby in Coronation Street in 1998</p>

<p>Tests showed Rickitt, who married Miss Fawcett in 2014 had 80 micrograms of alcohol per 100 millilitres of breath - more than double the 35mg limit.  </p>

<p>In mitigation defence lawyer Victoria Thompson said: 'He is deeply ashamed to be appearing before the courts and is not someone who's whatsoever been in trouble.' </p>

<p>She added that Rickitt had 'a difficult day' after putting his savings into the bar before coronavirus hit.    </p>

<p>Rickitt was also fined £230 and ordered to pay £119 in costs and surcharges. </p>
