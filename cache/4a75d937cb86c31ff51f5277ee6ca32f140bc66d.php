<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A one-time anti-Islamic State fighter has been found not guilty of killing a drug dealer whose body was found in a shallow grave next to a tomahawk.</p>

<p>But a jury has found Ashley Mitchell Scott Dyball, 28, guilty of improperly interfering with the corpse of Samuel Thompson.</p>

<p>After a four-day trial and less than a day of deliberations, the Brisbane Supreme Court jury found Dyball not guilty of murder and not guilty of manslaughter.</p>

<p>Mr Thompson's decomposed body was found buried in Beerburrum State Forest, north of Brisbane, about three weeks after he was killed on March 7, 2017.</p>

<p>The trial heard he died either from a blow to his face with a tomahawk, or from being strangled.</p>

<p>The cannabis dealer - who made thousands of dollars from selling drugs - told friends he was meeting a new supplier on the day he died.</p>

<p>The trial was shown CCTV footage of Dyball arriving at the house of another dealer Roberto Boscaino shortly before Mr Thompson on the day of the killing.</p>

<p>Mr Thompson's body was later taken from the house in a toolbox on the back of Boscaino's Mitsubishi Triton ute.</p>

<p>Boscaino was sentenced to life in prison in December after being found guilty in a separate trial of murdering Mr Thompson. He pleaded guilty to a charge of interfering with a corpse, along with drug and weapons offences.</p>

<p>But Dyball, who fought with Kurdish forces against Islamic State in Syria five years ago, pleaded not guilty to a charge of murder and another of improperly interfering with Mr Thompson's remains.</p>
