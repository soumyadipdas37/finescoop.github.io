<p>The Bachelor EXCLUSIVE: Locky Gilbert's rumoured 'winner' Irena Srbinovska's (pictured) REAL name is revealed</p>

<p>The source claimed Irena's pronunciation should be 'Ee-renna (with a European-sounding 'r'), instead of the version heard on TV - 'Eye-reen-ah'.</p>

<p>In fact, some of Irena's family members post videos about the show while using the correct pronunciation.</p>

<p>It's believed her name is written exactly the same, but the pronunciation on the show is not the 'real' intended way for Irena's name to be spoken.</p>
