<p>Not ideal: On Thursday, Bella Varelis (pictured) revealed the shocking insight that the massive estate - which was home to dozens of girls this season - even ran out of toilet roll, after anxious shoppers around the country bizarrely stocked up mid-crisis</p>

<p>Bella also discussed the moment she began to realise the pandemic was becoming more and more serious. </p>

<p>She added: 'We were experiencing [the pandemic] with everyone else. Because we were so closed off from everyone, we thought "surely it can't be that bad?" - but yeah, toilet paper was out!'</p>

<p>Filming of the eighth season of The Bachelor - starring Survivor star Locky Gilbert - was eventually suspended in late March.</p>

<p>Gradual change: Bella went on to say that the ladies didn't realise how serious the pandemic was, until the were told by host Osher Günsberg that filming had to stop</p>

<p>Bella added that she had no idea that the virus had become such a worldwide problem - and it wasn't until host Osher Günsberg came in to deliver the news that the girls knew things were serious.</p>

<p>'It really kicked in for us when it was that night, they were like, "we have to stop filming". I looked at Osher and was like - are you pulling my leg? I didn't believe it.</p>

<p>'I mean, as if a virus has gotten that bad that it's taken over Australia and the world. It was a pretty big shock. Ultimately I thought: if this is us going on halt, is this it? Do we get to talk to Locky again?</p>

<p>Devastated: Despite their constant contact throughout lockdown, the brunette bombshell didn't end up winning Locky's heart - despite the former Survivor star telling her he was in love with her in the tense finale</p>

<p>'But I think it's the best thing that happened for The Bachelor. It was kind of nice to bring the connection back down to normality.'</p>

<p>She added that she was told by producers that she'd get one FaceTime a week with Locky, and two days that they could text.</p>

<p>'That went out the window,' she laughed. 'Locky ended up calling me that morning. We spoke for like, five hours that day.'</p>

<p>Despite their constant contact throughout lockdown, the brunette bombshell didn't end up winning Locky's heart - despite the former Survivor star telling her he was in love with her in the tense finale.</p>

<p>Instead, he chose Irena Srbinovska as his winner - leaving Bella completely heartbroken.</p>
