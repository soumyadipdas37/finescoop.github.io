<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wallaby has survived being hit by a car and trapped behind the vehicle's grille overnight during an unexpected 300km road trip. </p>

<p>The young mammal was hit by a family in a car in Laura, in Far North Queensland, on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>The family got out of the car to try and find the wallaby, but assumed he had hopped away after failing to track it down.</p>

<p>The wallaby (pictured) spent a night trapped behind the vehicle's grille during a 300km drive</p>

<p>The young mammal (pictured) was eventually found in the car and taken to safety, after spending a night in the car</p>

<p>They continued their drive to Cairns - which was three and a half hours and a staggering 304km away - before going to sleep at their accommodation.</p>

<p>But the next day the family heard a noise coming from their car, and was shocked to discover the wallaby inside the vehicle's grille.</p>

<p>RSPCA Cairns Inspector Ben Newman was called to free the wallaby - who was rescued by Friday afternoon.</p>

<p>'I couldn't believe it,' Mr Newman said.</p>

<p>'This would have to be one of the greatest animal survival stories of all time.</p>

<p>'Incredibly he only had a few scratches and after a visit to the vet was deemed fit to be returned to the wild.' </p>
