<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Roma striker Edin Dzeko is facing a dilemma as to whether he should play against Hellas Verona on Friday evening or prepare for his Juventus medical, according to reports in Italy.</p>

<p>Dzeko is set to join Juventus from Roma in a £13.7million (€15m) deal having agreed personal terms on a two-year contract worth £7m (€7.5m) per season.</p>

<p>But with a deal for Arkadiusz Milik - Dzeko's proposed replacement at Roma - being held up by a contract dispute with Napoli, Paulo Fonseca stated that the former Manchester City forward would play tonight in their Serie A season opener against Verona.</p>

<p>Edin Dzeko is torn between playing for Roma tonight and preparing for his Juventus medical</p>

<p>A deal for Arkadiusz Milik - Dzeko's proposed replacement- is being held by a contract dispute</p>

<p>However, multiple reports including from Sky Sport Italia and Tuttosport claim that Dzeko's camp has informed them that the Bosnian does not want to play in case injury scuppers his move to Juventus.</p>

<p>Poland international Milik was all set for a smooth move to Roma from Napoli after the clubs agreed on a loan deal with an obligation to buy of £16.5m (€18m) plus up to £6m (€7m) in bonuses and two youth players.</p>

<p>But the deal is being held up because Milik wants to receive the two months of outstanding wages for the new season and is asking the club to drop its fines over the infamous December 2019 'mutiny' within the squad.</p>

<p>Milik started his medical on Friday and that will continue on Saturday, however the contractual dispute with Napoli is still stalling matters.</p>

<p>Paulo Fonseca therefore said that Dzeko will be involved against Hellas Verona on Friday</p>

<p>That has made it an uncomfortable situation for 34-year-old Dzeko, who is set to bring the curtain down on a five-year spell in the Italian capital with a switch to Turin.</p>

<p>And if he does not play against Verona, the only option Roma appear to have is deploy Henrikh Mkhitaryan as a makeshift centre-forward.</p>

<p>Mkhitaryan joined Roma on a permanent transfer earlier this summer after terminating his contract with Arsenal following a successful loan spell at the Stadio Olimpico during the 2019/20 campaign. </p>

<p>But if Dzeko does not play, the only option for Roma is to use Henrikh Mkhitaryan in that role</p>
