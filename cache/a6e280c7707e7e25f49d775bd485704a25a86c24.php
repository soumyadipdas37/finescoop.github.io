<p>The 64-year-old actress and producer rolled her eyes when asked about the persistent rumours by the show's host, Anh Do. </p>

<p>'I see these magazines and they're so mean-spirited… I hope people realise it's all made up,' she said.</p>

<p>Speaking out: Deborra-Lee Furness addressed long-running rumours husband Hugh Jackman is 'gay' during her appearance on Anh's Brush with Fame on Tuesday</p>

<p>She added: '[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married. </p>

<p>'It's just wrong. It's like someone saying to Elton John, "Oh he's straight." I'm sure he'd be p**sed! </p>

<p>'And so what! What are we discussing here… Is he a vegetarian… Is he gay?' </p>

<p>Rumours surrounding Hugh's sexuality have plagued the 51-year-old multi-talented actor for most of his career. </p>

<p>'I see these magazines and they're so mean-spirited… I hope people realise it's all made up,' she said</p>

<p>Deborra-Lee said she also finds it frustrating when people tell her how 'lucky' she is to be married to The Greatest Showman star - and how sometimes people make her feel like she's 'won a chook raffle'. </p>

<p>'People don't realise that it's actually rude to say that,' she said.</p>

<p>'Lucky because he's a stud muffin and all that … but that's showbiz and Hollywood and the brand of Hugh Jackman.' </p>

<p>'[Hugh's] been gay for so many years, I was gay too when I did [the 1988 film] Shame. They were shocked when I got married,' she said</p>

<p>But after 24 years of marriage, Deborra-Lee said she's come to realise it's all part of being married to a Hollywood heartthrob.</p>

<p>Deborra-Lee also spoke about meeting Hugh on the set of the Australian TV series, Correlli, back in 1995.</p>

<p>She revealed there was an 'instant attraction' between them, and said they confessed their feelings for each other in Hugh's kitchen one night and have been together ever since.  </p>

<p>Annoying: The 64-year-old actress and producer rolled her eyes when asked about the persistent rumours by the show's host, Anh Do</p>
