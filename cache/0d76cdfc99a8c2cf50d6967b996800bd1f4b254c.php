<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Phil Foden is aiming to make the spot David Silva vacated his this season as he looks to finally be given a starting place in the Manchester City team.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old has been limited to cameo roles in recent years and has had to bide his time while Silva has run the show at the Etihad.</p>

<p>However, after his man-of-the-match performance in the Carabao Cup final, Foden has been given more responsibility in some of City's biggest games, having featured in the Champions League round of 16 second leg as a false nine.</p>

<p>Phil Foden (above) is hoping to claim David Silva's spot in the Manchester City team</p>

<p>While he may have been limited to chances at the Etihad, City have made it clear that the England international will become Silva's eventual successor, with boss Pep Guardiola rating the attacking midfielder very highly.</p>

<p>And Foden is hoping he will be given the chance to claim Silva's spot in the upcoming campaign following the Spaniard's summer switch to Real Sociedad. </p>

<p>'I am hoping so but there are a lot of midfielders still and a lot of quality in the team,' Foden said. '[Guardiola] is not going to just give me that position easily.</p>

<p>'Everyone has to train well and play well so it depends on me playing well enough to get that shirt. So yes, it is down to me. </p>

<p>The 20-year-old has been limited to cameo roles in recent years while Silva dominated the role</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola rates the England international very highly and sees him as Silva's successor</p>

<p>'I am only 20 years old; A lot of people have been pushing it for me to play in the senior team much earlier but I haven't played a lot of games at Man City.</p>

<p>'Recently, I have played a lot more and I have been doing well so I have had to work hard for the opportunity. Now I have got it, I am just trying to give it my best I can do and just enjoy it really. That's what I am trying to do.</p>

<p>'I played in some massive games last year in cup finals and big Champions League games. They are the games that everyone wants to play in. </p>

<p>'Sometimes it is difficult for a young player to play in those games but I think he has been patient with me and played me at the right times. I am learning a lot and I feel ready to go.'</p>

<p>Foden (right) says Silva (left) is his mentor and owes a lot to his development as a player</p>

<p>Silva departed City after 10 trophy-laden years earlier this summer for pastures new in LaLiga, with Foden saying that he owes a lot to the man he labels as his 'mentor'.</p>

<p>'It is just what he sees [that makes him so great], he sees the game so different from other players,' Foden said of Silva. </p>

<p>'How he moves into space in tight areas and how he receives the ball, never losing the ball, all these things, I have learned so much from him.'</p>
