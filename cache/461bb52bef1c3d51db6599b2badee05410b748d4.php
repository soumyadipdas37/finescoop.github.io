<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's the most basic of parental duties but the mother of a Sydney five-year-old allegedly beaten to 'within an inch of his life' is accused of a hideous betrayal. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia can exclusively reveal grim details of the case against a Cabramatta mum, 31, who was found with her injured son at home late last month. </p>

<p>Court documents reveal the mother, who cannot be named, is accused of failing to get her son 'appropriate medical attention'.</p>

<p>That's after he had allegedly suffered 'significant and persistent physical harm and abuse' over a period of up to two months. </p>

<p>The details of how police allege the mother let the boy down can be revealed as she was hit with a fresh charge on Wednesday of intentionally wounding the boy.</p>

<p>Her boyfriend, 20, has been accused of the same offence, with police to allege in court that he beat the child with a stick or wooden pole. </p>

<p>The injured boy is pictured with his parents on his second birthday. The mother and father have long been estranged from one another</p>

<p>A picture, which a source said was uploaded years ago, has been leaked from the woman's social media pages. It prompted a friend to ask 'what's happened with his face?'</p>

<p>'House of horrors': Police were called to the mother's home in Cabramatta after a commotion on Friday August 28</p>

<p>As the mother was refused bail at court on Wednesday for the brief of evidence to be served, it can be revealed questions have been raised about the boy before.</p>

<p>A photo leaked to Daily Mail Australia from the woman's now-deleted social media pages shows the boy with several scratches or scabs on his head two years' ago. </p>

<p>The picture prompted a friend to ask in Vietnamese 'what's happened with his face', but the mother did not publicly reply. </p>

<p>It is not suggested that the marks were necessarily caused by abuse, neglect or wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The boy was found at his mother's red brick rental about 9.50pm on Friday, August 28 in a critical condition. </p>

<p>He was taken to hospital where he was placed on life support. </p>

<p>It took five days for the boy to wake up at Westmead Children's Hospital, with loved ones crowing that it was a 'miracle' he was alive.</p>

<p>'I couldn't imagine how (the father) would be if he lost him, he means the absolute world to him,' one source said.</p>

<p>Piles of water bottles, Red Bull and coconut drink were heaped together in the mother's yard</p>

<p>Both the boy's mother (pictured, left) and her boyfriend (right) have been arrested and charged</p>

<p>The boy, five, is seen with a toy earthmover prior to the horrendous alleged ordeal </p>

<p>Police confirmed on Wednesday that the boy is still in the care of doctors, some twelve days after he was found. </p>

<p>But he is in a stable condition, with the boy's father constantly by his side. </p>

<p>The boy's father and mother have been estranged for some time, with both moving on with new partners in the past two years.</p>

<p>'I miss and love you so much', the father captioned a picture of his son on Facebook in 2018, after his relationship with the mother fizzled.   </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the boy's mother presented herself to friends as a doting parent who lavished her son with toys.</p>

<p>She described the child as her 'prince' on Facebook and said she hoped he grew up to be 'obedient and smart.' </p>

<p>'You are all of my life,' she said.</p>

<p>The mother did not apply for bail at Liverpool Local Court on Wednesday and it was formally refused. </p>

<p>She will return to court in October. Her boyfriend has also been refused bail.</p>
