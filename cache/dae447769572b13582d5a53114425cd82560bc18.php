<p>The video was taken on Wednesday at AdventCare Whitehorse in Nunawading in Melbourne's east for a staff member's birthday</p>

<p>Dancers are seen mingling with the residents, holding their hands and getting close to them with no face masks, gloves or protective equipment.</p>

<p>The video was posted to TikTok with the caption: 'Would have been great if we weren't in Stage Four lockdown. There was no social distancing at all and hardly anyone wore face masks'.</p>

<p>The party was held for a staff member's birthday and workers were allegedly told not to post anything on social media.</p>

<p>'One resident was sad because they can't see their families at all and this happened,' the caption read.</p>

<p>'Residents there are already at high risk. This isn't fair for the families of the residents.'</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth said the footage was 'troubling' but said staff were likely trying to give residents 'a bit of respite'.</p>

<p>'We can't have any exceptions to the rules, particularly in aged-care and PPE - it absolutely has to be used,' he told The Today Show.</p>

<p>Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth said the footage was 'troubling' but said staff were likely trying to give residents 'a bit of respite'</p>

<p>'The masks have to be used during all interactions. That's the Health Department guidelines and that is protect the residents from staff bringing the virus in.'</p>

<p>Dr Coatsworth said the virus usually gets into aged-care facilities from staff.</p>

<p>'I'm sure there will be appropriate reflection on whether that was the right thing to do and management will be looking closely at that,' he said.  </p>

<p>AdventCare CEO David Reece said everyone in the video was a staff member or a resident and no external performers were let in.</p>

<p>Mr Reece acknowledged that no one was wearing personal protective equipment but insisted it was put on immediately after the video was taken. </p>

<p>He said he was comfortable with how the party was 'managed'. </p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews commented on the incident during his press conference on Monday morning.</p>

<p>'I am not here to quarrel with the CEO of that facility but I have seen comments from him talking about the fact that it was a closed event and only people who lived there and work there will involved,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>'Frankly staff do not live there, they live in the community and we have community transmission so I do not know that is the best rebuttal or defence.</p>

<p>'We all have to be vigilant and aged care is and will remain for the forseeable future a high risk environment.'</p>

<p>Victoria reported five new coronavirus deaths linked to aged care facilities on Sunday, bringing the state death toll to 761. </p>

<p>The state recorded just 11 new infections on Monday and two deaths, the lowest number in three months. </p>

<p>Victoria Police said no complaints have been lodged so no investigation is underway. </p>
