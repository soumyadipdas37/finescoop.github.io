<p> Little Jimmy O'Reilly, pictured with his relieved parents Michelle Buckley and Chris O'Reilly was all smiles on Sunday, a day after he spent 12 hours lost in dense bushland</p>

<p>'Once it was getting close to sunset, I was really starting to panic,' Ms Buckley told reporters.</p>

<p>'I was just losing hope, I honestly thought we were going to … find him dead.</p>

<p>'I didn't think I was going to find him alive, I thought I was going to have to bury my son.'</p>

<p>Hours earlier, she had been feeding her baby son Henry when Jimmy followed the family's dogs into nearby bushland.</p>

<p>The family had arrived at the property a day earlier. </p>

<p>Jimmy's disappearance sparked a widespread search that included a police helicopter, search dogs and mounted units, State Emergency Service volunteers and local residents desperate to help find the blond-haired blue-eyed youngster.</p>

<p>Michelle Buckley burst into tears as she recalled how she feared the worst about her little boy</p>

<p>Jimmy O'Reilly vanished around 7.30am on Saturday at Karli Rise in Yallingup, south of Perth</p>

<p>Jimmy was wearing Spider-Man pyjamas and thick wellington boots, which would have helped him cope with the horrendous conditions.</p>

<p>Locals regard the areas as one of the most dangerous precincts in the Cape's region.</p>

<p>Jimmy was miraculously found by his grandfather and uncle at about 7pm on Saturday night, one kilometre away from where he vanished. </p>

<p>While cold, thirsty and hungry, Jimmy was relatively unscathed. </p>

<p>Ms Buckley fell to the floor when she learned Jimmy has been found. </p>

<p>'They put him in the car and brought him back to us. We brought him inside, took off his pyjamas and wrapped him up in a blanket,' she told the West Australian.</p>

<p>'He was smiling, talking to (his baby brother) and he said 'I went out into the bush', and it was just the most beautiful moment.'</p>

<p>Mr O'Reilly said there was joy and tears when they heard Jimmy had been found safe.</p>

<p>'I could have ran on water,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>'It was the highlight of the worst day of my life.</p>

<p>'The fact that he was talking and smiling. He was definitely cold and afraid and hungry.</p>

<p>'It was sad seeing him like that. But he basically walked out of it without a scratch, on him, which is crazy.'</p>

<p>After telling his grandfather was hungry, Jimmy was given water to drink, Oreos and a Snickers chocolate bar before being reunited with his parents.</p>
