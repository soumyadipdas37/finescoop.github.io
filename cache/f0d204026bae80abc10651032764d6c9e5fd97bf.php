<p>Hong Kong is looking to establish a 'travel bubble' with Australia and ten other countries</p>

<p>The Asian financial hub on the doorstep of China, was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic after a second wave of cases ravaged the former British colony in July and August</p>

<p>Edward Yau Tang-wah, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development said at a media conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the plan would be require travellers to be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and departure. </p>

<p>'We need to ensure that a coronavirus test – that is mutually recognised – can be carried out before travelling, and another verification is needed after arrival,' according the South China Morning Post.      </p>

<p>'Our health authorities would then proceed to further discussion with those countries.'  </p>

<p>As well as Australia and New Zealand, other nations being considered are Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, France, Germany and Switzerland.</p>

<p>Mr Yau said countries where the spread of the virus is 'under better control' are the top priority.</p>

<p>'These are places with which we have made initial contact, but whether travel bubbles can be established... would depend on a host of factors, including the epidemic situation and its containment in respective places,' he said.</p>

<p>'Of course the timetable will be a matter of bilateral agreement between Hong Kong and partnering countries. </p>

<p>'It all depends on how ready and comfortable both parties are with the situation.' </p>

<p>In the past few weeks Hong Kong has only recorded a handful of new COVID-19 infections</p>

<p>Edward Yau Tang-wah, the Secretary for Commerce and Economic Development said at a media conference in Hong Kong on Wednesday, the plan would be require travellers to be tested for COVID-19 on arrival and departure</p>

<p>But despite the positive news, Yau Tang-wah said the implementation of such a scheme is still a long way off.</p>

<p>'I shouldn't give members of the community a false illusion that [the travel bubbles] could be done within days,' he said.</p>

<p>'The situation remains fluid and could change depending on circumstances.'</p>

<p>But whether Australia and other nation's take up Hong Kong on the offer is another story.</p>

<p>The federal government still has a ban on international tourism both inbound and out.</p>

<p>On top of this, Hong Kong's new national security laws introduced in July by Beijing to silence pro-democracy advocates has left relations with Canberra extremely frosty.</p>

<p>Anti-government protests have flared up on the streets of Hong Kong again after weeks of relative calm since the implementation of a sweeping security law. Police detain people as they patrol the area after protesters called for a rally in Hong Kong on September 6</p>

<p>As a result, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has warned Australian citizens to 'reconsider' visiting and remaining in Hong Kong. </p>

<p>'The new national security legislation for Hong Kong could be interpreted broadly,' DFAT's Smart traveller website states. </p>

<p>'Under the law, you could be deported or face possible transfer to mainland China for prosecution under mainland law.  </p>

<p>'You may be at increased risk of detention on vaguely defined national security grounds.  </p>

<p>'If you’re concerned about the new law, reconsider your need to remain in Hong Kong.'</p>
