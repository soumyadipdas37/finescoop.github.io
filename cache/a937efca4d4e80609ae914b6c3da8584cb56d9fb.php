<p>'They have no storage,' she complained, but conceded, 'They do have toilets. We were wrong, we thought they had long drops, but they did have toilets.'</p>

<p>Jasmin described their design for the bathroom as 'clean and safe', and admitted she was nervous about taking any risks after losing the previous challenge.</p>

<p>'Why?' asked a clearly confused Luke, 35, from the driver's seat.</p>

<p>'I'm just sad. I'm mourning my Block loss, because I wanted to come on this show and do something amazing that I really love,' she explained.</p>
