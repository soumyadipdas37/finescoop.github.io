<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump is taking steps to revoke federal funds from New York City and other cities he says are descending into 'anarchy', according to a new report.</p>

<p>Trump on Wednesday signed a five-page memo ordering all federal agencies to send reports to the White House Office of Management and Budget on federal funds going to four cities that can be redirected, according to the New York Post.</p>

<p>In addition to New York, the memo names Seattle, Washington DC and Portland, Oregon as potential targets for revocation of federal funds. </p>

<p>'My Administration will not allow Federal tax dollars to fund cities that allow themselves to deteriorate into lawless zones,' Trump says in the memo, according to the Post.</p>

<p>President Donald Trump is taking steps to revoke federal funds from New York City and other cities he says are descending into 'anarchy', according to a new report</p>

<p>'To ensure that Federal funds are neither unduly wasted nor spent in a manner that directly violates our Government's promise to protect life, liberty, and property, it is imperative that the Federal Government review the use of Federal funds by jurisdictions that permit anarchy, violence, and destruction in America's cities.'</p>

<p>Federal agencies must detail 'all Federal funds provided to Seattle, Portland, New York City, Washington, D.C.'</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Trump ordered Attorney General Bill Barr to develop a list within 14 days of 'anarchist jurisdictions' that 'permitted violence and the destruction of property to persist and have refused to undertake reasonable measures' to restore order.</p>

<p>The order does not name the cities that Barr should investigate, giving the attorney general discretion as to which cities to designate. </p>

<p>The memo also instructs White House budget director Russ Vought to issue guidance in 30 days from Wednesday 'to the heads of agencies on restricting eligibility of or otherwise disfavoring, to the maximum extent permitted by law, anarchist jurisdictions in the receipt of Federal grants.' </p>
