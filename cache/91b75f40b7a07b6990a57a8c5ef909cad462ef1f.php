<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dame Judi Dench has revealed she hates being called a 'national treasure'.</p>

<p>The actress, 85, detailed her thoughts on being referred to by the term and how much she 'loathes' it during an appearance on David Tennant's podcast 'David Tennant does a podcast with...' on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The phrase is widely used to describe the award-winning British actress thanks to her remarkable 60 year career, which has seen her star in the James Bond franchise, Shakespeare In Love and countless theatre plays.</p>

<p>Candid: Dame Judi Dench admitted that she 'LOATHES' being called a national treasure as it makes her feel like 'a relic' while appearing on David Tennant's podcast on Tuesday</p>

<p>But Dame Judi admitted it makes her feel like a 'relic', as she explained: 'I loathe those words, I loathe them. </p>

<p>'It's something very, very dusty behind a glass and in a corner. It's a relic and I don't want to be a relic.'</p>

<p>She also went on to say she hates 'playing parts that are expected' like 'some old person dying in a chair' and instead prefers exciting roles like evil villains. </p>

<p>Thoughts: The phrase is widely used to describe the award-winning actress (pictured as M in Skyfall) thanks to her remarkable 60 year career, but she said: 'I don't want to be a relic'</p>

<p>She explained: 'I hate to play parts that are expected. If a part comes through and it's some old person dying in a chair somewhere, I think "oh no no, please not that".</p>

<p>'I want to play somebody who you think is a benign old lady sitting in a chair but in actual fact she's bumping people off. I'm looking for a lot of villains to play. I haven't played enough.'</p>

<p>Dame Judi also spoke about her late husband, fellow actor Michael Williams, who passed away in 2001.</p>

<p>As she spoke about her current relationship with conservationist David Mills, Dame Judi said she won't ever get over her husband.</p>

<p>She said: 'He [David] laughs about the same things but I suspect I shan't ever get over Mikey.</p>

<p>'[Grief] changes who you are altogether. It's like you're walking along and there's this enormous chasm in front of you.</p>

<p>'I don't expect you ever get used to it. Sometimes the door in this house just opens and I think he's just wandered in.' </p>

<p>Future plans: She also went on to say she hates 'playing parts that are expected' like 'some old person dying in a chair' and instead prefers exciting roles like evil villains (pictured in 2018)</p>
