<p>The incident came days after it was revealed the president allegedly refused to visit a war cemetery in Paris back in 2018 and said Americans who died in wars were 'losers' and 'suckers' – but Trump denies the report.</p>

<p>As Biden attended church and visited his loved ones, Trump spent Saturday and Sunday playing golf at the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia.</p>

<p>Brennan’s tweet was met with bitter backlash by Twitter users to said he was disrespecting Biden in his emotional visit to his family's graves. </p>

<p>'Despicable you would even try to make this a story. He’s visiting his son’s grave and no one, with any humanity left in them, would expect him to make it into a PR event. It actually notches up my respect for him even more. Shame on you,' another Twitter user added.</p>

<p>'This is the Director of Strategic Response for the Trump campaign mocking Joe Biden for walking through the graveyard where his son is buried after leaving church this morning while Donald Trump spent his day on the golf course,' Andrew Weinstein, chair of the Democrats Lawyers’ Council said.</p>

<p>One user shared a video of Donald Trump actually meandering, walking around a lawn aimlessly avoiding reporters.</p>

<p>'Walking in a straight line is not meandering. Get a grip,' one Twitter user clapped back.</p>

<p>'Meandering, as one does while visiting one’s child’s grave. Where do they find little p****s like you, Francis?' another social media user added.</p>

<p>Biden's sentimental visit to his family's graves comes after news broke that the president allegedly refused to visit the graves of american war heroes in France in 2018. </p>

<p>On Thursday the Atlantic reported that the president allegedly dismissed a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery near Paris, saying 'why should I go to that cemetery? It’s filled with losers.'</p>

<p>Twitter users slammed Brennan for trying to mock Biden as he visited his family's graves</p>

<p>Mia Farrow admonished Brennan saying: 'He is visiting his son's grave. Are you even human!!'</p>

<p>Andrew Weinstein, chair of the Democrats Lawyers’ Council noted that Brennan was disrespecting Biden for visiting his family's graves as Trump spent his day on the golf course</p>

<p>Yo Francis, <?php echo e('@'); ?>FrancisBrennan is this meandering?https://t.co/9w23nFGWCh</p>

<p>He canceled the visit and blamed rain for the decision, saying the helicopter couldn’t fly and Secret Service couldn’t drive him there.</p>

<p>In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to more than 1,800 marines who died at Belleau Wood as 'suckers' for getting killed.</p>

<p>Trump denied ever saying those statements. </p>

<p>On Friday Trump said that his former chief of staff John Kelly 'could have been' a source for those claims.</p>

<p>Four people with alleged knowledge of the cemetery incident claimed it happened, to the magazine.</p>

<p>Trump has been heavily criticized for the shocking comments that disrespect veterans and war heroes.</p>

<p>Former secretary of defense Chuck Hagel, a Republican, said the remarks are 'credible' due to Trump’s track record of denigrating military personnel.</p>

<p>He’s made audacious comments against former US defense secretary James Mattis and US Senator John McCain. </p>
