<p>Raymond Ward, 27, and Marcus McKenzie, 30, used a crowbar to force open a window to break into the house in the early morning raid, CCTV footage shows.</p>

<p>The burglars stole designer sunglasses, solar lighting and a £200 bike from the garden in The Meadows, Nottingham, while the family were asleep upstairs.</p>

<p>The burglars stole designer sunglasses, solar lighting, a set of car keys and a £200 bike from the garden while the family were sleeping upstairs</p>

<p>The duo also stole a set of car keys but left the vehicle on the driveway.</p>

<p>But despite their efforts to disguise themselves with blue medical face masks, the burglars were caught days later.  </p>

<p>Ward and McKenzie, both of Nottingham, were jailed at the city's crown court after they admitted burglary.</p>

<p>McKenzie was sentenced to 18 months in prison while Ward was jailed for two years.</p>

<p>Ward was also given a further 34 weeks in custody, to be served consecutively, for breaching a suspended sentence.</p>

<p>He was also handed six-month prison terms to be served concurrently for a burglary at the Slug and Lettuce pub, which also took place on July 28.</p>

<p>The court heard he also burgled student accommodation in Castle Boulevard, on July 19 and an attempted burglary at the same student premises on July 29.</p>

<p>Despite their efforts to disguise themselves with blue medical face masks, the burglars were caught just days later</p>

<p>PC Imran Ahmed, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: 'Ward and McKenzie had no regard whatsoever for any of their victims.</p>

<p>'They committed the Victoria Embankment burglary while the victims and their two small children were asleep upstairs, causing them great distress and anxiety.</p>

<p>'They were also in possession of a crowbar which could have been used as a weapon in the event of them being disturbed.</p>

<p>'We want to reassure people that Nottinghamshire Police takes burglary extremely seriously and thoroughly investigates reports.</p>

<p>'Burglary is an incredibly upsetting and impactful crime which can have not only a long-lasting effect for the victim, but the whole wider community too.</p>

<p>'Crimes of this nature can make residents feel frightened or anxious in their own home, the place which is meant to be their safe haven.'</p>
