<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Married At First Sight star Tamara Joy has copped a brutal spray from her own father over her 'clown' look due to her use of lip fillers.</p>

<p>The reality star shared the awkward exchange on Instagram on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In a series of videos, the 31-year-old's father brought her a coffee in bed, before he unleashed on her love of cosmetic injectables.</p>

<p>That's brutal! Former MAFS star Tamara Joy's dad said that her lips look like a 'clown', are 'ridiculous', and 'unnatural' in a rant that was posted to Instagram on Wednesday </p>

<p>'The lips. It's old hat. It's in the past. Move on. It's ridiculous,' Tamara's father, Les, is seen telling his daughter in the clip. </p>

<p>Tamara, to her credit, appears to take the criticism in her stride, as she laughs it off and asks her dad how he has become a lip expert. </p>

<p>'So, I'm out of fashion because my lips are big?' she asks Les with a laugh, indicating that the pair are close and that their clash was in good fun. </p>

<p>Loose lips: Tamara's dad was less than impressed with his reality star daughter's artificial pout</p>

<p>'It's not natural. It looks ridiculous, I think. You look like a clown mate. But that's just ridiculous,' he continued. </p>

<p>Tamara was heard trying to reason with him as she laughed off his playful opinion: 'That's brutal dad,' she replied. </p>

<p>Tamara, who previously admitted to getting filler in her lips, showed off a plump pout in a number of short clips prior to her exchange with her dad. </p>

<p>The beauty's pout looked suspiciously larger than usual, indicating that she may have had some recent enhancements.  </p>

<p>The reality star is certainly no stranger to using surgery to change up her look.   </p>

<p>Alongside a nose job and lip fillers, Tamara has also undergone a breast enlargement.</p>

<p>Before and after: Tamara unveiled her new nose for the first time back in September last year. (Pictured: left, before her rhinoplasty, and right, in September after her surgery)</p>

<p>For her rhinoplasty, the socialite sought out the services of renowned facial plastic surgeon Dr Michael Zacharia.</p>

<p>Tamara was spotted wincing in pain as she left Dr Zacharia's clinic in Sydney in September, with a large bandage across her nose.  </p>

<p>Dr Zacharia has previously performed nose jobs on Bachelor stars including Megan Marx and Keira Maguire.</p>

<p>Claim to fame: Tamara shot to fame on Married At First Sight </p>

<p>Tamara previously opened up about her cosmetic enhancements in an interview with Yahoo Lifestyle in March last year.</p>

<p>'People do it for all different reasons and I guess mine was just more so… I had a bit of a booty and I really wanted to balance that out, that's why I did it,' she said, referring to her boob job.</p>

<p>She added: 'If it makes you feel better about yourself, why not?'  </p>

<p>Flashback! In addition to her nose job, the star has also had lip fillers</p>
