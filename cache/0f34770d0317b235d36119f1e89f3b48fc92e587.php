<p>Footage released after the launch shows the booster falling back to Earth, narrowly missing a school, before crashing and exploding in a nearby town.</p>

<p>The horrifying scene was captured near the Lilong village, Gaoyao Town in the Luonan county of Shaanxi province and the video surfaced on the Chinese social media site Weibo.</p>

<p>China launched its Long March 4B rocket Monday, sending an Earth observation satellite to orbit - but the booster’s return was not so successful. Footage released after the launch shows the booster falling back to Earth, narrowly missing a school, before crashing and exploding in a nearby town</p>

<p>China launched its remote sensing satellite, called Gaofen-11 (2), Monday morning, which will be used in land census, urban planning, road network design, crop estimation and disaster prevention, Space.com reported.</p>

<p>The satellite joins China’s High-resolution Earth Observation System, which began in 2010 and launched the first device in 2013.</p>

<p>China has kept a tight lid on its satellite constellation, but footage of the first Gaofen 11 in 2018 and previous footage suggests these specific technologies are part of a larger aperture telescope used to observe Earth.</p>

<p>And although Gaofen-11 (2) made its way to orbit, the Long Marc 4B rocket booster that took it there had a hard time returning home.</p>

<p>The horrifying scene was captured near the Lilong village, Gaoyao Town in the Luonan county of Shaanxi province and the video surfaced on the Chinese social media site Weibo</p>

<p>Footage surfaced shortly after the launch of the failing booster, which instantly exploded into a massive orange cloud after making a crash landing.</p>

<p>The video shows the booster off in a distance and bystanders watching who begin shouting once they see it is headed towards a nearby school.</p>

<p>The clip then shows a view from inside the town, with a massive orange and yellow cloud in the background – the booster luckily missed the school.</p>

<p>Although no injury reports have surfaced, the Long March 4B first stage is fuled with a toxic mixture of hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide that can causes serious health problems for those who come in contact with the concoction.</p>

<p>Although this launch was not a complete success, China completed a separate one of Friday that took off without any problems</p>

<p>The country set off a reusable experimental spacecraft aboard its Long March 2-F carrier into orbit from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwestern Chinese region Inner Mongolia, reported state media Xinhua, without specifying the time of the launch.</p>

<p>No images of the spacecraft or its lift-off have yet to be released. Staff and visitors at the launch site were prevented from filming or discussing the project online, according to reports.</p>

<p>The reusable experimental spacecraft is currently in orbit and testing ‘reusable technologies during its flight, providing technological support for the peaceful use of space’, said Xinhua.</p>

<p>It is scheduled to return to a Chinese landing site at an unspecified date.</p>
