<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's Irena Srbinovska has been tipped to win Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart since the beginning of the season.  </p>

<p>And Channel 10 appears to have dropped another major hint that the 31-year-old nurse will triumph over her rival Bella Varelis, 25, during this week's grand finale episode.  </p>

<p>On Thursday morning, the network provided a telling detail about the winner's identity by posting an Instagram photo of Irena and Bella posing in their finale dresses. </p>

<p>The dress theory! The colour of Irena Srbinovska's dress in The Bachelor finale suggests she will be the winner over Bella Vareilis, who is seen wearing a slightly darker gown </p>

<p>According to a long-standing fan theory, whoever is wearing the lighter coloured dress during the finale will ultimately win the heart of the Bachelor and the show. </p>

<p>This theory has been proved realiable over the years, with previous stars Chelsie McLeod, Laura Byrne, Alex Nation and Snezana Markoski all finding true love with their respective suitors. </p>

<p>In this year's promotional image, Irena is pictured wearing a patterned brown dress by designer Con Ilio, while Bella wears a slightly darker coloured plum ballroom gown by Georgia Young Couture.  </p>

<p>Hint: Last year's winner Chelsie McLeod (left) wore a nude form-fitting gown with a plunging neckline, while runner-up Abbie Chatfield (right) wore a much darker, black beaded number.</p>

<p>Clue: Previous winner Laura Byrne (left), wore a much lighter frock than her rival Elise Stacy (right), and ended up in the arms of Matty 'J' Johnson</p>

<p>If history repeats itself, it appears Irena is set to be the last woman standing when the final scenes play out. </p>

<p>Last year's winner Chelsie McLeod wore a nude form-fitting gown with a plunging neckline, while runner-up Abbie Chatfield wore a much darker, black beaded number. </p>

<p>Similarly, previous winner Laura Byrne, wore a much lighter frock than her rival Elise Stacy, and ended up in the arms of Matty 'J' Johnson. </p>

<p>And again! Likewise, winner of Bachelor Richie Strahan's heart, Alex Nation (left), fronted the finale in a light gold dress, while Nikki Gogan (right) wore a vibrant red lace gown </p>

<p>Colour codes: The trend also traces back to when Snezana Markoski (right) stood before Sam Wood in a white beaded dress when he declared she was 'the one'. Meanwhile, runner-up Lana Jeavons-Fellows (left) wore a darker hue, but only by a shade - a baby blue dress with sheer mesh skirting</p>

<p>The pair are now engaged and expecting their second baby together.  </p>
