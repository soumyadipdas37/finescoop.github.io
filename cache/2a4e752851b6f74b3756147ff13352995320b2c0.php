<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The CEO of ViacomCBS was cleared by an independent investigation of an accusation of inappropriate touching dating back to 2016, it was revealed Thursday. </p>

<p>The accusation was made by a former Nickelodeon worker who claimed Bob Bakish, 56, touch her butt at a holiday party when he was still interim CEO of Viacom.</p>

<p>The investigation comes less than a year after Viacom and CBS merged and Bakish was installed as chief over the merged company in December. </p>

<p>He ascended to the role after former CBS boss Leslie Moonves was terminated in 2018 over numerous sexual misconduct claims.  </p>

<p>ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish was cleared of sexual misconduct claims by an independent investigation carried out by a firm hired by the company, it was revealed Thursday</p>

<p>The complaint against Bakish was made earlier this year by the ex-employee at the Viacom network and a probe was immediately launched using an outside firm hired by the company, The Information first reported. </p>

<p>The investigation concluded, however, that the evidence 'did not support the allegation.' </p>

<p>'The Board takes any allegation of this type seriously,' ViacomCBS said in a statement. </p>

<p>'An independent review of the alleged incident has concluded, and the investigation did not support the allegation.' </p>

<p>The alleged inappropriate touching would have taken place while Bakish was still interim CEO at Viacom. </p>

<p>He temporarily took over the role in November 2016 and the position was made permanent the following month. </p>

<p>CBS faced earlier controversy with Moonves when multiple allegations of past sexual misconduct, including forcibly touching women, were reported by the New Yorker.  </p>

<p>He was also accused of having created an atmosphere of fear and intimidation at the network. </p>

<p>Twelve women in total made claims that Moonves sexually harassed, intimidated or assaulted them. The allegations spanned from 1985 to the early 2000s.  </p>

<p>CBS hired two law firms to look into the allegations being made about the 70-year-old executive, who was named president of the company in 1995 and in 2016, also became the chairman.</p>

<p>They were criticized and faced questions of credibility, however, as it was feared the firms may be too close to the media giant. This may have been the reason for an independent firm investigating the claims against Bakish.  </p>

<p>Moonves reportedly admitted to receiving oral sex from a woman but claimed it was 'consensual'. </p>

<p>He denied having any non-consensual sexual relationships yet resigned amid the uproar. </p>

<p>After Moonves departure, CBS had conducted a broader misconduct probe of its workplace. </p>

<p>The wider investigation led to the ousting of long-time '60 Minutes' producer Jeff Fager a week later following sexual misconduct allegations made against him. </p>

<p>Fager also sent a threatening text to a CBS reporter working with The New Yorker to cover the claims. </p>

<p>'Be careful. There are people who lost their jobs trying to harm me and if you pass on these damaging claims without your own reporting to back them up that will become a serious problem,' he wrote. </p>

<p>ViacomCBS chair Shari Redstone has spoken out about how she wishes for a healthy corporate culture to be maintained and for the company to have strong governance.</p>

<p>The company has a majority female board with seven women among their 13 directors. </p>

<p>Redstone, whose National Amusements was the controlling stakeholder in both CBS and Viacom, had eyed a merger of the companies for a while but Moonves was adamantly opposed to the combination, according to The Wrap. </p>

<p>His resignation cleared the way for her to make the merger happen.  </p>

<p>Redstone has backed Bakish since his appointment, Variety reported.   </p>

<p>He has been at Viacom since 1997 as president and CEO of its international cable channels before becoming CEO.  </p>

<p>Bakish succeeded former Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman, who was forced out during a power struggle in August 2016.  </p>

<p>He lives in New York with his wife and two daughters.  </p>

<p>Stocks in ViacomCBS closed up almost one percent Thursday as the investigation into Bakish was revealed. </p>
