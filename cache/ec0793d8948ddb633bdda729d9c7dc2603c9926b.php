<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A photographer has snapped the incredible moment three ducks escorted a highly venomous tiger snake that had been swimming in their lake back to the shore.</p>

<p>Tim Kemp was in Whiteman Park north of Perth this week when he spotted the snake making its way to a patch of floating vegetation where the ducks had been sitting.</p>

<p>He immediately braced for the worst, expecting the ducks to become the snake's next meal only to then see them calmly lead the reptile back onto dry land. </p>

<p>Mr Kemp told Daily Mail Australia he'd never seen anything like it in all his years as a wildlife photographer.</p>

<p>Nature photographer Tim Kemp witnessed the remarkable moment three ducks escorted a tiger snake back to shore in Whiteman Park near Perth this week</p>

<p>Mr Kemp said he initially thought the ducks were about to become the snake's next meal before seeing them lead the reptile back to shore</p>

<p>'As the minutes ticked by and there weren't any feathers flying or wings splashing, I realised if the birds knew the snake was there, they didn't care,' he said.</p>

<p>'I think the ducks knew they weren't in any danger. None of them had a nest on the vegetation they were relaxing on. And they're just too big for the tiger snake to fit in its gob.</p>

<p>'Smaller birds and frogs would have been on the menu, had the snake been able to find them.'</p>

<p>After racing to snap a few photos of the remarkable encounter Mr Kemp watched as the snake slithered onto the shore and out of sight.</p>

<p>He was amazed the three ducks were all from different breeds but had come together to shoo away the snake - only to return to the swamp completely unfazed.</p>

<p>'The ducks weren't any worse for wear. Several breeding pairs swam off together. I watched a male Shelduck showing off to a female. A number of swans and ibises came gliding in for a cleaning and relaxation session on the little green island,' he said.</p>

<p>Tiger snakes are extremely venomous to humans and can prey on small birds and mammals</p>

<p>Mr Kemp said the birds were unfazed by the tiger snake and were far too big to be eaten</p>

<p>The snake had swam towards a patch of vegetation where the ducks had been basking in the sunshine</p>

<p>'I walked back to my car, thinking about how a bunch of different species of birds worked together to guide that Tiger snake away from their hangout. </p>

<p>'Don't see that every day.'</p>

<p>Mr Kemp said he'd had run ins with snakes before but had never seen one take to the water.</p>

<p>On one occasion he credited a red-cheeked wattlebird from 'saving' him from a Tiger snake after he nearly walked right on top of it.</p>

<p>'As usual, I wasn't paying attention to the ground. The wattlebird's calls became louder as I approached,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Kemp said the ducks didn't seem to care they were swimming next to an extremely deadly snake</p>

<p>Tiger snakes can swim underwater for up to nine minutes as well as climbing trees</p>

<p>'When I was about two metres from the bird, it dropped off its perch and swooped down in front of me - claws and scimitar-shaped beak flashing at the Tiger snake I'd not seen. "Phew! Thanks bird!".'</p>

<p>Tiger snakes are highly venomous to humans and are responsible for the second highest number of snake bites in Australia.</p>

<p>Bites can be fatal if left untreated and in January this year a 79-year-old farmer in Tasmania died after he was bitten several times on his leg and hand.</p>

<p>Tiger snakes can grow up to two metres long and are extremely venomous to humans</p>

<p>They are found in south-east and south-western parts of Australia</p>

<p>Bites can be fatal if left untreated and their venom can also lead to kidney failure</p>

<p>Tiger snakes are able to swim and can climb as high as ten metres </p>

<p>They feed on fish, frogs and tadpoles, lizards, birds and mammals</p>

<p>The venomous snakes can also stay underwater for nine minutes </p>
