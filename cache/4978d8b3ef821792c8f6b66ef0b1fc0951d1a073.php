<p>Sections of the Real Madrid dressing room were reportedly relieved at Gareth Bale's departure</p>

<p>During his seven years at The Bernabeu Bale has won an array of trophies including four Champions Leagues, two La Liga titles, the Copa del Rey and three Club World Cups.</p>

<p>He has scored 105 goals in 251 games for the club but made just 16 league appearances last season and was desperate to play regularly again.</p>

<p>Bale is set to earn over £13million in wages as part of his loan deal and he is set to be joined at Tottenham by Sergio Reguilon, who was on loan at Sevilla from Real last season. </p>

<p>During his initial spell at Tottenham Bale became a club hero despite a slow start and he was outstanding during the 2012-13 campaign, scoring 21 goals in the Premier League.  </p>
