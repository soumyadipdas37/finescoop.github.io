<p>One shopper said she was quite impressed with the quality from Kmart after comparing it to an expensive mattress in a box she purchased from a high-end store.</p>

<p>'Both have been equally as good... Quality is equal but Kmarts price was much cheaper,' she said.</p>

<p>However, not everyone was impressed with the mattress, with one shopper giving the product a two star out of five.</p>

<p>'I thought it was worth a try and know you get what you pay for, but this mattress is really only suitable for a spare room, not for every night. It's nice and lush with a lovely soft cover top, but not supportive enough for me anyway,' she claimed.</p>

<p>While another added: 'Comfortable mattress. A bit too soft for my taste though. The edges are also not firm, making me almost fall off the mattress a few times.'</p>
