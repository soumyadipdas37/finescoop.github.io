<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former V8 superstar Renee Gracie who sensationally quit motorsports to become an OnlyFans porn star has revealed how she has splashed her cash.  </p>

<p>Gracie has earned more than $1million dollars selling nudes online- a lavish jump from her previous $18,000-a-year pay cheque.  </p>

<p>And after racking up over $500,000 in one month, the adult entertainer decided to spoil herself to her own Mercedes supercar. </p>

<p>'I earned over $500,000 in June. I haven’t had a month that big but I am fairly consistent with my earning from month to month. I will keep on working and posting videos. I don’t see that type of money disappearing or stopping anytime soon and that is why I made the decision to buy the car,' she told the Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>Former V8 superstar Renee Gracie has enjoyed a lavish lifestyle since leaving motorsports last year to become a porn star. She is pictured in the Gold Coast last week</p>

<p>As a driver, Gracie has revealed she only earned $18,000 a year, over 55 times less than the more than $1million she has earned in the adult industry. She is pictured preparing for practice at Bathurst in 2015</p>

<p>The car enthusiast traded in her second-hand mustang to purchase her new $350,000 ride, which she paid for in cash. </p>

<p>The top end model boasts 596 horsepower, reaching speeds up to 332km/h.</p>

<p>'It is more a race car than a sports car. I’d prefer power to luxury and this car is ridiculously fast. I would be able to see how it really goes until I get it out onto a track. I will do a few things to it and will get it out on the track for a track day when I am happy with it,' she said. </p>

<p>'It was a big deal for me when I was able to earn enough money just to buy the second-hand Mustang. I was broke when I finished racing. It actually cost me money to go racing and half the time I was out of pocket just trying to buy food. I was staying in crappy hotels. Now I have earned more than $1 million in less than a year.' </p>

<p>The announcement comes days after before-and-after pictures emerged showing just how much the former private schoolgirl has transformed in the nine months since leaving the track.</p>

<p>Throwback photos of Renee from her Supercars days show her wearing minimal makeup, and with her now-famous curves hidden beneath baggy racing attire. </p>

<p>In contrast, recent social media photos show the brunette bombshell wearing heavy makeup while leaving very little of her body to the imagination. </p>

<p>Having previously been forced to hide her sprawling tattoo collection beneath a racing uniform, Renee is now enjoying the freedom to show off her ink online. </p>

<p>Among her many tattoos is a dramatic chandelier-inspired design around her breasts, as well as an image of Buddha on her thigh.</p>

<p>The Queenslander was once Australia's first female professional V8 Supercars driver, having famously partnered with Swiss racer Simona de Silvestro at Bathurst in 2015.</p>

<p>But after years of financial struggles, Renee abandoned her racing career and began posting nude pictures on adult website OnlyFans in late 2019.</p>

<p>OnlyFans is a subscription-based platform which allows 'creators' to earn money by sharing pornographic content for a monthly fee.</p>

<p>Speaking about her decision to quit Supercars, Renee told Daily Mail Australia in July she 'just couldn't afford it anymore'.</p>

<p>'I had to come up with $600,000 a year to race,' she said. 'I had to get my own sponsors and any crashes or scratches I got on the car I had to pay for myself.</p>

<p>'We had insurance but the excess was so high that the team bosses used to tell me, "Don't crash – but if you do, make sure you write it off." Just a minor crash could cost $10,000. It's a savage sport.'</p>

<p>She now earns up to $25,000 per week selling explicit content on OnlyFans.</p>

<p>Renee claims she has no regrets about turning to porn, saying she didn't make a cent in her seven years of racing.</p>

<p>'I'm in a position now where I don't have to be reliant on anyone else. I don't have to beg for sponsorship,' she said.</p>

<p>She now earns up to $25,000 per week selling explicit content on OnlyFans and is on track to make $1million this year. Pictured left in September 2015, right in March 2020 </p>

<p>Despite working in an industry in which she makes racy content for strangers, Renee says her parents support her new career</p>

<p>'I have the money to pay for it myself. When I think back to where I was two years ago to where I am now I almost can't believe it,' she added.</p>

<p>Despite working in an industry in which she makes racy content for strangers, she says her parents support her new career.</p>

<p>'Believe it or not, my dad knows it and supports it,' she recently told TN Sport.</p>

<p>'I think you could say my dad is actually proud because of the financial position I am in and what I have been able to do with the site. You look at what I have achieved not what I am doing, it has been a success.'</p>

<p>Renee also recently admitted that at one point she thought about quitting the adult industry, before her father encouraged her to continue.</p>

<p>'I had a little bit of a rough time on OnlyFans. It does get hard to try and be creative all the time. I turned to my dad and said, "I'm just over it, I don't think I'm going to do it anymore,"' she told the Hit Network's Hughesy &amp; Ed.</p>

<p> Renee has recently begun mentoring women starting out on OnlyFans </p>

<p>'And he actually said, "Don't stop, you're making so much money, don't stop." He actually encouraged me to keep doing it because it's been life-changing, and if anyone was in the position to make this kind of money everyone would try and do it.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Renee has recently begun mentoring women starting out on OnlyFans.</p>

<p>'I have coached a lot of girls now,' Renee said in a YouTube video in June, while promoting her own 'mentoring' website for breaking into the porn industry. </p>

<p>'I share all my tips and tricks, the games I play. I have themed days, I have really good ways for how to structure your page and be consistent with your pricing,' she said.</p>
