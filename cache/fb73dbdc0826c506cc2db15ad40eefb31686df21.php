<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Violence, gangsters and shootings still ravage South Africa a year on from the country's Rugby World Cup win that was hoped would help bring change to a nation.</p>

<p>The grave issues are laid bare in harrowing testimony by two of the Springboks' icons – captain Siya Kolisi and try-scoring sensation Cheslin Kolbe – in an exclusive interview with Sportsmail.</p>

<p>The pair both come from humble backgrounds.</p>

<p>Siya Kolisi inspired South Africa to Rugby World Cup glory over England in Japan last year</p>

<p>Now he and team-mate Cheslin Kolbe (L) are trying to end the gang violence problem at home</p>

<p>Kolisi, the nation's first black skipper who went from living in a township to lifting the Webb Ellis Trophy by beating England in Yokohama last November, grew up in poverty in Zwide near Port Elizabeth.</p>

<p>And Kolbe had to run from gang warfare as a child in Kraaifontein in the Western Cape, where this summer there were weeks of violent riots after the government tried to dismantle informal settlements in a community where many had lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Both now sporting stars, the duo are using their voices to detail the horrendous scenes that still scar their country – hoping awareness of the problems will help solve them.</p>

<p>'Normally the easiest way to make money, is to join a gang,' Kolisi, who now runs a foundation with his wife Rachel to assist those in disadvantaged communities, told Sportsmail.</p>

<p>'Because there are not a lot of opportunities.</p>

<p>'I've been working in the "coloured" areas here in South Africa and there was a boy that was shot.</p>

<p>The duo are using their voices to try and end the violence seen in disadvantaged communities</p>

<p>The Springboks captain delivers food parcels to a township in East London, South Africa</p>

<p>'His name is Brian. He was shot when he was three years old through cross-fires.</p>

<p>'He was playing at home and his mother got shot in the hips, and he got shot in the head. He's been paralysed since he was three years' old. It's been 14 years since – he's 17 now and laying in bed.</p>

<p>'That's the kind of stuff that happens day-in day-out. You could be playing in the street and because of gang-fire you could get shot.'</p>

<p>Toulouse winger Kolbe, 26, described two incidents from his life – one from his childhood, and another as an adult when he played in South Africa for the Cape Town Stormers team.</p>

<p>'Myself and my wife Layla have had first-hand experience,' he said.</p>

<p>'After one of the Stormers games I just got home to the area where my parents live in Scottsville and normally you don't see police driving in the street because it's one of the more quiet streets in the community.</p>

<p>'I was just about to pull up into the yard and the police-van just turned around the corner.  </p>

<p>Kolisi grew up in poverty and went from living in a township to lifting the Webb Ellis Trophy</p>

<p>Kolisi has taken an active role in trying to end the violent scenes within struggling areas</p>

<p>According to figures published by South Africa's police service and reported by Bloomberg in July 2020, South Africa's murder rate is at its highest level for over 10 years.</p>

<p>The murder rate rose by 1.4 per cent to 21,325 in the 12 months prior to March 2020, an average of 58 a day.</p>

<p>South Africa's murder rate of 36 per 100,000 people is high compared to an international average of seven per 100,000.</p>

<p>'I said to my wife "listen here, it's weird to see that at this time". She opened up the gate and the next thing was that gangs started shooting at the police, and were setting fires off.</p>

<p>'For me growing up as a youngster it was something I faced. Up until now it's still happening, even in day-light.</p>

<p>'I also had an experience when I was about 10. I was walking from my parents' house to my gran's place – I had to cross a big field to get there. It was about 2pm.</p>

<p>'In the community gang members have certain territories, so others can't come there or there will be fights.</p>

<p>'There was one gang that came to the territory, they were questioning, and then the next minute there was a shooting war that broke out. That was daylight, with people coming out of work, and a fight broke out with shooting and everything.</p>

<p>'That's a challenge that my community faces.'</p>

<p>South Africans are still defined by their race. "Black" South Africans, like Kolisi, total around 79 per cent of the population, "whites" nine per cent, with "coloured" people – those of mixed European or Asian ancestry like Kolbe – around a similar number.</p>

<p>And Kolbe, who plays in Saturday's European Heineken Champions Cup semi-final against Exeter Chiefs, wants to highlight the struggles of the "coloured" community in South Africa.</p>

<p>'Me as a "coloured" – they are known for gangsterism,' he adds.</p>

<p>'I don't think people are aware of how bad it still is today.</p>

<p>'There should be more awareness around it, especially in our "coloured" communities. It's so bad that it's a norm for every other South African what is happening in terms of shooting and drug dealing.</p>

<p>'There is not an example made out of those gangsters. They don't face the penalties they should.</p>

<p>'Our government should make an example of those people who are part of gang wars. To lay down the foundation of how things should be.</p>

<p>'Kids should not look up to gangsters, but to us as rugby players, or other sports people.</p>

<p>Kolisi was also subjected to racist abuse when he married his wife Rachel in 2016 </p>

<p>Kolbe was outstanding in last year's Rugby World Cup final, ending England's hopes in Japan</p>

<p>The Springboks beat England 32-12 in Yokohama to lift the Webb Ellis trophy for a third time</p>

<p>'I want to make a difference, be an inspiration, be a hero for them to look up to and hopefully that can give hope to them.'</p>

<p>He has set up a foundation called 'Be The Difference' which feeds 1,700 people in the Western Cape, similar to Kolisi's charity.</p>

<p>The pair are both represented by Roc Nation Sports, who are owned by rapper Jay-Z and have Premier League stars Marcus Rashford – who has been equally outspoken on grave issues – and Kevin De Bruyne on their books.</p>

<p>Kolisi, 29, concluded: 'Cheslin's story and so many "coloured" people's stories are so important. In South Africa Black and White stories are amplified but the "coloured" people don't get spoken enough about.</p>

<p>'There are so many guys in our country who are shining examples to show the kids in the communities they come from that this is possible. That's why what he's doing is making a difference.'</p>
