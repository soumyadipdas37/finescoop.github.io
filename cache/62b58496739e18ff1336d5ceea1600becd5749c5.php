<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Shocking new photos show the scale of devastation from California's wildfires, which have raged throughout the state and - in the case of the Creek Fire - burned homes and businesses to the ground.</p>

<p>In Washington state, too, the majority of a town was destroyed by wildfires.</p>

<p>Malden was 80 per cent destroyed, residents said.</p>

<p>On Tuesday the first images emerged from the Creek Fire, which is still burning in northern California.</p>

<p>The fire started on Friday night and in three days has burnt 152,833 acres, according to Cal Fire.</p>

<p>They reported that 65 homes, businesses and other structures have been destroyed so far. </p>

<p>Across California, 14,100 fire fighters were battling 25 separate blazes, which have collectively burned more than two million acres and left 172,000 people without power during a record heat wave in the drought-stricken state.  </p>

<p>In Yosemite National Park, officials said evacuation orders could be issued soon as the Creek Fire drew near, casting an apocalyptic orange haze over the idyllic landscape.   </p>

<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom on Sunday night declared a state of emergency as his hard-hit state struggled to beat back the blazes.</p>

<p>The Labor Day weekend heat wave fueled new fires that pushed the state to set a new record for number of acres burned with more than two million as of Monday.   </p>

<p>The previous record was set just two years ago and included the deadliest fire in state history, the Camp Fire, which ripped through the town of Paradise and killed 85 people in November 2018.  </p>

<p>Cal Fire spokeswoman Lynne Tolmachoff said the new record was especially alarming because of how early in the year it was set. </p>

<p>'It's a little unnerving because September and October are historically our worst months for fires,' Tolmachoff told AP. </p>

<p>'It's usually hot, and the fuels really dry out. And we see more of our wind events.' </p>

<p>California has seen 900 wildfires since August 15, many of them started by an intense series of thousands of lightning strikes in mid-August. There have been eight fire deaths and more than 3,300 structures destroyed. </p>

<p>Randy Moore, regional forester for the Forest Service's Pacific Southwest Region, warned that the blazes are expected to worsen in the coming days.  </p>

<p>'The wildfire situation throughout California is dangerous and must be taken seriously,' Moore told AP. 'Existing fires are displaying extreme fire behavior, new fire starts are likely, weather conditions are worsening, and we simply do not have enough resources to fully fight and contain every fire.'   </p>

<p>It remains unclear how the Creek Fire started, but photos taken on Tuesday showed the devastation in the Meadow Lakes area</p>

<p>On Tuesday night, Cal Fire said that the Creek Fire had worsened in the previous 24 hours owing to strong winds.</p>

<p>'The fire continued to grow under extreme conditions,' they said in an update. </p>

<p>'The Red Flag Warning for strong winds will impact the fire in the early morning, with stronger winds to come. The fire made wind driven runs and increased spotting distance. </p>

<p>'Red Flag Warning in effect until 11 pm Tuesday for high temperatures, low humidity and high winds.'</p>
