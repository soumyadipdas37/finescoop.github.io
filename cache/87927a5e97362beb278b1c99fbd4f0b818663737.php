<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>John Gosden is looking to use a French jockey on Stradivarius in the Prix de L’Arc De Triomphe at Longchamp on October 4 with Covid-19 quarantine arrangements meaning few British-based jockeys will cross the Channel to ride in Paris.</p>

<p>An eight-day isolation period for jockeys returning from France — an elite athlete arrangement — means jockeys who ride at Longchamp would have to miss the Future Champions meeting at Newmarket featuring the Fillies’ Mile and Dewhurst Stakes, both Group One prizes, the following week.</p>

<p>That has ruled out Andrea Atzeni, who has a perfect three from three record on Stradivarius, because of his retainer to owner Sheik Mohammed Obaid, who has Zabeel Queen entered in the Fillies’ Mile.</p>

<p>John Gosden is looking to use a French jockey on Stradivarius in the Prix de L’Arc De Triomphe</p>

<p>Gosden said: ‘It is most likely it will be a French jockey because if it is a British one they then can’t ride in the big races at Newmarket. We will look it through with (owner) Bjorn Nielsen.’</p>

<p>Frankie Dettori, who rides Gosden’s dual Arc winner Enable in the race, has ridden Stradivarius in 17 of his 26 races.</p>

<p>Gosden used four-time French champion jockey Ioritz Mendizabal when Mishriff won the French Derby in July and has also used vastly-experienced Olivier Peslier in the past.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, eight-time Arc winning trainer Andre Fabre has confirmed Persian King, winner of the one-mile Prix Du Moulin on his latest run, will take his chance in the half-mile longer Arc.</p>
