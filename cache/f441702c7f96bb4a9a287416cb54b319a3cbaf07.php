<p>He's back:  Zayn Malik is counting down the days until fatherhood and while his fans keep a close eye on his Insta for baby updates, the star surprised them on Wednesday with a rare post</p>

<p>Zayn left his 35.6million Instagram followers baffled with the post, which didn't show his face, just the back of his shaved head as he played the game.  </p>

<p>'The New <?php echo e('@'); ?>HarryPotterPuzzlesAndSpells game is sick! Check it out #HarryPotter #PuzzlesandSpells #Sponsored,' he captioned the post.</p>

<p>Fans were baffled by the post, with one commenting 'BRUH I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE A PIC WITH THE BABY.'</p>

<p>'LMFAO NOT ZAYN DOING AN AD,' wrote another. 'Babe what is this [crying face emoji' was another reaction, while others were full of support: 'OK GET YOUR MONEY I SUPPORT,' gushed one loyal follower. </p>

<p>What's going on? Posting for only the second time in over two months, the singer shared a bizarre sponsored post promoting a new Harry Potter game, prompting baffled comments</p>

<p>Zayn is expecting his first child with his longterm girlfriend Gigi Hadid, with the model's mother Yolanda giving an update on the pregnancy last week.</p>

<p>In photos shared to her Instagram on Friday, the grandmother-to-be rested on her head on her 25-year-old daughter's belly. </p>

<p>Alongside the sweet black and white photos, the 56-year-old Dutch model said she was 'waiting patiently for her angel to be born.' </p>

<p>Partners: Zayn is expecting his first child any day now with his longterm girlfriend Gigi Hadid</p>

<p>In a second photo, four hands, belonging to three people, rested on Gigi's belly. </p>

<p>Based on a photo Gigi shared on August 31, captioned '33 weeks,' the mother-to-be is nearing the end of her pregnancy. </p>

<p>It's unclear if she was 33-weeks when she shared the photos, which would make her 35-weeks plus, or if she was marking when the photos were taken in late July, putting her 40-weeks, putting her days away from giving birth.  </p>

<p>Waiting: Gigi's mum Yolanda Hadid is clearly excited about becoming a grandma, as she shared sweet photos on her Instagram on Friday</p>

<p>Yolanda's post comes just a day after Gigi's father Mohamed Hadid posted a handwritten note to his soon-to-arrive grandchild. </p>

<p>His post sent fans spiraling, assuming the model gave birth, though when asked if the baby had arrived he said 'no not yet.' </p>

<p>Gigi has spent much of her pregnancy at her mother Yolanda Hadid's farm in Pennsylvania, where her family isolated during the pandemic. </p>

<p>The model confirmed her pregnancy in April, after 'family sources' first revealed the news she and her on/off boyfriend of boyfriend of five years were starting a family. </p>

<p>Angel: The 56-year-old Dutch model said she was 'waiting patiently' for her angel to be born.'  A second photo showed four hands, belonging to Yolanda, Gigi and her sister Bella</p>

<p>She said at the time: 'Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms but we're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support. </p>

<p>'Especially during this time, it's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.'  </p>

<p>An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month that the couple had been getting along great ahead of the birth of their baby.</p>

<p>'[They are] closer than ever. Gigi has been living at her mom’s farm with Zayn,' the source revealed. 'She came back to NYC recently but she plans to spend most of her pregnancy there at the farm.'</p>

<p>Coming soon: Based on a photo Gigi shared on August 31, captioned '33 weeks,' the mother-to-be is nearing the end of her pregnancy</p>

<p>And it seems their incoming bundle of joy will be just the start for the young family. </p>

<p>Back in May People said the celebrity couple 'plan to have a large family. 'They've been through their ups and downs, but neither stopped caring about the other.' </p>

<p>Of expanding their brood, they went on: 'They've jumped on the timing of having a baby and are preparing for their new lives. </p>

<p>'Gigi is young but always said she wants several kids. She's sensitive and nurturing and will be a great mom.' </p>

<p>Overjoyed: Yolanda's post comes just a day after her father Mohamed Hadid posted a handwritten note to his soon-to-arrive grandchild. His post sent fans spiraling, assuming the model gave birth, though when asked if the baby had arrived he said 'no not yet'</p>

<p>Hadid and Malik's relationship has not always been perfect. The duo began dating in in November 2015, three months after the musician called off his engagement to Little Mix star Perrie Edwards. </p>

<p>But after just over two years together, the couple confirmed their break-up on Twitter in March 2018.</p>

<p>The pair reconciled in December of 2019 after a year long split, during which time Gigi briefly dated former Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron.  </p>

<p>Time flies: An insider told Us Weekly magazine last month that the couple had been getting along great ahead of the birth of their baby, living together at Yolanda's farm</p>
