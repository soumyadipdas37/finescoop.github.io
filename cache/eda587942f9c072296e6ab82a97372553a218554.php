<p>As Locky Gilbert's top four contestants do the media rounds ahead of the last two episodes, Bella made a rather cutting remark to TV Week on Monday.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old marketing consultant gleefully told the magazine that she and Locky, 31, had said 'I love you' to each other during lockdown.</p>

<p>Given her fierce rivalry with Irena, it's likely this admission was directed at the 31-year-old nurse - who told Locky on the show last week she was 'completely in love' with him, but he couldn't say 'I love you' in return.</p>

<p>He's mine! The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (right, with Locky Gilbert) seems determined to twist the knife into her love rival Irena Srbinovska as the dating show heads into its final week</p>

<p>For context, on-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from mid-March until the first week of July, due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>During this three-and-a-half-month period, Locky kept in touch with the women via Zoom, text messaging and FaceTime - and it was about this time that Bella and Locky supposedly said they loved each other 'in texts'.</p>

<p>However, Bella hastened to add they did so using emojis, not actual words.</p>

<p>Bombshell: As Locky Gilbert's top four contestants do the media rounds ahead of the last two episodes, Bella made a rather cutting remark to TV Week on Monday. She gleefully told the magazine that she and Locky, 31, had said 'I love you' to each other during lockdown</p>

<p>Cruel: Given their fierce rivalry, it's likely this admission was directed at 31-year-old nurse Irena (pictured), who told Locky on the show last week she was 'completely in love' with him - but he couldn't say 'I love you' in return</p>

<p>She explained: 'We've both said, "*love heart emoji" you" in texts, but not the full sentence yet. Those three words mean a lot to me and Locky knows that, so it's not something I take lightly.'</p>

<p>Bella added: 'There were months between filming, and Locky and I would FaceTime for hours a day. We just enjoyed each other's virtual company.'</p>

<p>Bella's boastful interview comes after Irena told Locky on Wednesday's episode that she had 'fallen completely in love with' him.</p>

<p>Humble brag: 'We've both said, "*love heart emoji" you" in texts, but not the full sentence yet. Those three words mean a lot to me and Locky knows that,' Bella told TV Week</p>

<p>But the former Australian Survivor star, 31, was unable to say 'I love you' in return - because Bachelors are banned from doing so until the finale.</p>

<p>He did kiss her and offer her a rose, however. </p>

<p>In light of this, Bella's revelation that she and Locky exchanged 'I love you's privately during lockdown will no doubt cut deep.</p>

<p>As of Tuesday, Irena is the bookies' favourite to win ($1.27), Bella is tipped for runner-up ($3.50) and intruder Bec Cvilikas is expected to place third ($7.50) </p>

<p>The Bachelor finale week begins Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>
