<p>Kanye West has denied speculation he is running for president in an effort to help Donald Trump gain re-election and insisted that no one is bankrolling his campaign</p>

<p>West discussed his unlikely presidential bid in an interview with Nick Cannon's Cannon Class podcast airing Tuesday. Cannon shared a preview of the interview on Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>The pair shared a hearty laugh before Cannon said: 'But people are saying that you're a distraction, and because they don't want four more years of Trump, maybe you might.</p>

<p>'You want an alternative of four years of Ye. Is that realistic right now in 2020?'</p>

<p>'I'm not running for president - I'm walking,' West replied. </p>

<p>The interview recorded at the West Mountain Ranch in Cody, Wyoming, will be released in full on Tuesday. </p>

<p>West's claim that he's richer than Trump appears to be untrue, as Forbes lists the former's net worth at $1.3billion and the latter's at $2.1billion.  </p>

<p>But the rapper disputed Forbes' estimate when it came out back in April, saying that the true number exceeds $3billion. </p>

<p>West got a big laugh from Cannon when he said: 'I'm not running for president - I'm walking'</p>

<p>West announced his presidential candidacy in early July - just four months before election day. </p>

<p>'We must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION,' he tweeted on Independence Day.  </p>

<p>The announcement was met with with mixed reactions of skepticism and excitement, as online bookmakers placed his odds of winning at 50/1 - or two percent.</p>

<p>Since entering the race, West has done little to promote his candidacy and has only managed to get his name on the ballot in ten states so far, per CNN: Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah and Vermont. </p>

<p>His ballot status is still under review in Virginia and he still has time to file in Arizona, Kentucky, Mississippi, New Hampshire, North Dakota and Rhode Island. </p>

<p>In the remaining 33 states, West either missed the deadline to file for a ballot application or was denied because he didn't have enough signatures.  </p>

<p>West celebrated Independence Day by announcing his presidential candidacy on Twitter </p>

<p>Trouble within West's campaign has fueled speculation about his motives for staying in the race - including claims that Trump and the GOP may be bankrolling him in an effort to siphon black votes from Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.  </p>

<p>Concern among Democrats ratcheted up earlier this month after Jared Kushner, the senior White House adviser who also has a hand in Trump's re-election campaign, confirmed that he had spoken with West several times, along with other members of the billionaire long-shot presidential campaign.</p>

<p>'Kanye's been a friend of mine for — I've known him for about 10 years,' the president's senior adviser said during a White House press briefing.</p>

<p>'There's a lot of issues that the president has championed that he admires,' Kushner said of him.</p>

<p>West publicly aligned with Trump in a series of tweets in October 2018 that sparked concerns over the rapper's mental state.  </p>

<p>Soon after, he paid a visit to Trump at the White House - while wearing the president's trademark MAGA hat - and delivered a rambling, profanity-laden speech in which he discussed alternate universes and his diagnosis of bipolar disorder, which he said was actually sleep deprivation. </p>

<p>Speaking to a crowd of reporters in the Oval Office he said the hat was like a Superman cape and said that Trump made him a billionaire. </p>
