<p>Remember me? Izzy was sent home alongside Bec Cvilikas during Wednesday night's episode of The Bachelor - leaving Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska with a chance to win Locky's heart</p>

<p>During her appearance on The Project, Izzy was also asked about her mum, Christina, who shocked viewers when she asked Locky, 31, for his sperm during Wednesday's home visit. </p>

<p>While Izzy wasn't in the room during the awkward moment, she said she doubted that her mother was being serious. </p>

<p>'I wasn't there in the moment so I heard about it when we were having dinner after that and I thought mum was joking to start with - she was joking, just to clarify!' she laughed. </p>

<p>She added: 'She was joking, she has a funny sense of humour. I don't think she meant it.' </p>
