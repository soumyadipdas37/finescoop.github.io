<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A councillor who co-chaired a taskforce which looked into black, Asian and minority ethnic coronavirus deaths is being investigated over a claim he flouted social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>Sandwell Council confirmed that it was examining a complaint made against councillor and BAME task force member Mohammed Yaseen Hussain.</p>

<p>It came after images emerged online showing a gathering of a number of men - allegedly including the councillor - sitting close to each other at what appeared to be a private home.</p>

<p>Sandwell Council confirmed that it was examining a complaint made against councillor and BAME task force member Mohammed Yaseen Hussain after photos allegedly show him at a gathering in a private home where social distancing guidelines were not followed</p>

<p>The images were dated July 7 - a week before it was announced the councillor would co-chair the task force.</p>

<p>The complaint says: 'He was pictured (with) several men, indoors with a complete disregard to social distancing, no regard in using PPE and limiting the number of people he came into contact with indoors.'</p>

<p>The task force was set up by Birmingham MP Liam Byrne to hear first-hand accounts of how the coronavirus pandemic affected BAME communities in the West Midlands.</p>

<p>Office for National Statistics data showed the mortality rate for black men and women was more than four times higher than other groups.</p>

<p>Those of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and mixed ethnicities also faced a 'significantly' higher risk of dying with the illness than white people, the ONS found.</p>

<p>The task force, which heard testimony from those who lost relatives in the pandemic, has since presented a 42-page report with 35 recommendations for ministers, MPs, local government and the NHS.</p>

<p>It said the higher rate of coronavirus deaths constituted an 'urgent medical emergency'.</p>

<p>Of the allegation against Coun Hussain, a Sandwell Council spokesman said: 'The complaint will be investigated in line with our formal complaints procedure.'</p>

<p>He has never responded to repeated requests for a comment about the investigation.</p>

<p>The photos were shared on Facebook on July 7, one week before Mohammed Yaseen Hussain was made co-chair of a taskforce looking into covid deaths in the BAME community</p>

<p>A complaint was filed with Sandwell Council who are investigating the claims made after this post appeared online allegedly showing councillor Hussain at a private gathering</p>

<p>But, speaking at his appointment to the task force, Coun Hussain said: 'This crisis has taken a toll on our health service and on our communities.</p>

<p>'I've always said my role as a local councillor and community leader is to do whatever is needed to help.</p>

<p>'I've seen first-hand how devastated some families have been by what has happened to them and I am determined that we must learn the vital lessons to prevent this heartache happening again.'</p>

<p>Labour MP, Mr Byrne said previously: 'Over the last two months we have heard heartbreaking stories from families who have endured unimaginable pain during this pandemic.</p>

<p>'We've been told of loved ones dying alone and of families being unable to grieve.</p>

<p>'But we have also identified some truly heroic individuals who have gone out of their way to support their communities and that is why I wanted Coun Hussain to join this inquiry and share his valuable insights into what we must learn to ensure this never happens again.'</p>

<p>Asked for a comment on the investigation into Coun Hussain, Mr Byrne said: 'We can beat this virus by working together but only if we follow the guidance, wash our hands, wear face masks and observe social distancing.</p>

<p>'I urge everyone to do their bit to beat coronavirus.'</p>
