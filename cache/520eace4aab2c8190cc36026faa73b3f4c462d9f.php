<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Diego Maradona has slammed his critics after he took wearing a face visor to a new extreme in a bid to protect himself from contracting coronavirus during Gimnasia's friendly at San Lorenzo.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the Gimnasia manager arrived for their encounter with a huge clear face mask that covered the top of his head to beyond his chin.</p>

<p>The Argentina legend had his seven-year son Diego Fernando alongside him on the touchline - and he too took similar precautions against the deadly virus.</p>

<p>He and his son Diego Fernando (right) both did so to protect themselves against Covid-19</p>

<p>Many on social media compared his visor to that of Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear</p>

<p>The images of the 59-year-old drew comparisons by many on social to the fictional character Buzz Lightyear from the Toy Story film franchise.</p>

<p>However, the 1986 World Cup winner didn't see the funny side to those comparisons as he hit out those on Instagram after the match.</p>

<p>'Today I left my house with this mask, which my doctor recommended,' he wrote with the caption accompanied with his son.</p>

<p>'It is the same one being used by some doctors. I did it out of duty and respect for those who have died from COVID-19. And I was met with some mockery from adults, from boys and from some journalists.</p>

<p>'Those journalists who criticise you when you don't take care of yourself. And when you take care of yourself, too. Those who laugh at people like me, but when they give the death toll, they are scandalised. It would be good for them to understand that they cannot sell themselves at all costs, without respect for anything or anyone. Agree on it, guys.'  </p>

<p>Aside from the face mask, Maradona could also be seen having his hands sprayed in antibacterial gel by a member of staff while seated on the touchline.</p>

<p>As for the match itself it ended goalless - with the friendly shortened to two 30-minute halves as both sets of players slowly build up their fitness. </p>

<p>Wednesday's game was Gimnasia's first since the Argentina Football Association (AFA) cancelled all competitions, including the Superliga, on April 27 due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
