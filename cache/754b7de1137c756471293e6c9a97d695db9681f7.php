<p>The Senegal goalkeeper is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer of spending for Chelsea after Sportsmail revealed at the weekend they had agreed a £25million fee with the Ligue 1 side.</p>

<p>But while details are now close to being finalised, at the start of the negotiations Rennes' demands were reportedly completely different and included France World Cup winner Giroud.</p>

<p>Rennes' tried in vain to have Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud included in the Edouard Mendy deal</p>

<p>Mendy, 28, is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer for Chelsea</p>

<p>According to French outlet L'Equipe, the Ligue 1 side had demanded a £37m (€40m) fee for Mendy along with the option of signing the 33-year-old former Arsenal striker on loan for no charge at all.</p>

<p>However, that appears to have been rejected by the Blues who have now come to an agreement with their French counterparts on a £25m for the 28-year-old goalkeeper, whose contract at Rennes ran until 2023.</p>

<p>Mendy was left out of Rennes' 4-2 victory against Nimes on Sunday and now looks set to provide immediate competition for under-fire Kepa Arrizabalaga and Willy Caballero. </p>

<p>Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and manager Frank Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record.</p>

<p>Mendy will compete with Kepa Arrizabalaga, who made another blunder in the Brighton win</p>

<p>And the Chelsea boss may already been vindicated in his decision to sign Mendy after Spaniard Kepa made another blunder in their 2-1 win at Brighton. </p>

<p>Leandro Trossard made it 1-1 when his long-range left-footed strike flew underneath the body of the 25-year-old on Monday evening, which according to Squawka was the 19th Premier League goal scored outside the box he has conceded since arriving in England.</p>

<p>However, despite admitting after the game he remains happy with Kepa, Lampard appears close to signing Mendy in a bid to solve the club's goalkeeper issues. </p>

<p>The previous record fee for a goalkeeper moving from France to England was the £12.3m Chelsea paid to Rennes in 2004 for Petr Cech, who is now Chelsea's technical director and played a key role in Mendy's selection.</p>
