<p>But experts now say lovemaking can actually boost the chances of survival.</p>

<p>The 2003 Jack Nicholson film Something’s Gotta Give showed his music mogul character rushed to hospital after suffering an attack as he began to make love.</p>

<p>However, a study has found having an active sex life in the months after a heart attack is linked with a 35 per cent lower risk of death over the next two decades.</p>

<p>A total of 495 patients aged 65 or under who suffered a first heart attack were asked how often they had sex in the six months afterwards. </p>

<p>They were divided into two groups – those who reduced lovemaking and those who maintained an active sex life. </p>

<p>During an average follow-up of 22 years, 211 patients – 43 per cent – had died. But the risk of death was around one-third lower in the group who carried on having sex. </p>

<p>Professor Yariv Gerber of Tel Aviv University in Israel, who carried out the research, said: ‘Some patients hesitate to resume sexual activity for long periods after a heart attack.</p>

<p>‘Sexuality and sexual activity are markers of well-being. </p>

<p>'Resumption of sexual activity soon after a heart attack may be a part of one’s self-perception as a healthy, functioning, young and energetic person. </p>

<p>'This may lead to a healthier lifestyle generally.’ </p>

<p>Lucy Martin, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘Sex can feel like a taboo subject after having a heart attack. </p>

<p>'But it is important to remember sex is no more likely to trigger a heart attack – or other heart problems – than any other form of physical activity that gets your heart rate up and blood pumping.’</p>
