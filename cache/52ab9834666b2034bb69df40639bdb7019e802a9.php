<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A French policeman has kicked and stamped on a British man's head after he allegedly brandished a knife at officers who demanded he wear a mask on a train.</p>

<p>Footage taken by fellow passengers shows the 42-year-old Englishman struggling on the ground while being detained by two officers at the station in Orleans.</p>

<p>The police were called to haul the Briton off the train bound for Toulouse on Tuesday after reports that he was drunk and refusing to wear a mask. </p>

<p>As his colleague handcuffed the Briton, one of the policemen kicked the suspect's head down onto the train platform prompting a passenger to exclaim, 'It's like the United States!' </p>

<p>When the IGPN (the national police force) arrived the officers said that he was abusive and refused to comply so they were forced to drag him off the carriage.</p>

<p>The Englishman then allegedly took out a Swiss army knife and is said to have lunged at one of the officers' abdomen.</p>

<p>However, several passengers have contradicted the official account and told French media that they believe the police overreacted.</p>

<p>A witness called Pierre said that the Briton had tried to explain that he struggled to breathe with the mask on.</p>

<p>But the officer pointed at his vest and replied, 'What does that say? This is marked "Police", not a damned "social worker", I do not give a damn.'</p>

<p>It's further alleged by another witness named Clemence that one of the officers yelled: 'You're in France here, you're not in your country.'</p>

<p>After the suspect was handcuffed one of the officers continued to hold the sole of his foot against the man's head </p>

<p>However, the police union has poured scorn on the claims and said that it backs the officers '200%'.</p>

<p>Police union Alliance told France 3: 'They did what was necessary to remove him from the train.'</p>

<p>Referring to the alleged attempt to stab an officer, the union added: 'We see this as attempted murder.' </p>

<p>The IGPN has opened an investigation into the arrest. </p>

<p>The Briton has since been released from hospital and remains in police custody. </p>
