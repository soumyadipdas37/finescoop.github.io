<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The cosy sheepskin Ugg boot that was the the height of fashion in the early noughties has made a comeback  as stunning supermodels across the globe have been pictured sporting pairs as part of their post-lockdown looks.</p>

<p>The comfy cropped boot - which was originally designed to keep surfers feet warm in the 1970s - is a variation on the classic model, with a twist to keep up with 2020 street style.</p>

<p>Emily Ratajkowski (pictured in New York last week) and Joan Smalls have recently been spotted in the £145 Ugg Australia minis, while Sienna Miller, Gigi Hadid, Sarah Jessica Parker and Rihanna are also long term fans of the boots</p>

<p>Gigi Hadid is also a fan of the boots and has been spotted sporting them while out and about. She is pictured in New York last year</p>

<p>The shoe was once synonymous with WAGs and reality TV stars, with many pairing them with velour tracksuits for a casual look.</p>

<p>Now, more than a decade later, as coronavirus measures ease fashion icons across the world are once again opting for a cosy look, with Vogue branding Uggs 'the supermodel shoe of lockdown'. </p>

<p>Lyst, the largest global fashion search platform in the world, recently reported UGGs are making a comeback as there's been a huge search in people looking to buy the boot.</p>

<p>'Ugly boots are replacing ugly sandals post-summer, demand for UGG boots is growing 24 per cent week-on-week. Over the past month, there have been more than 41,000 searches for the brand,' the report read.</p>

<p>Binky Felstead (pictured  left in London) is often sported in a pair of UGG minis. Brie Larson (right in LA)  is also regularly seen in UGGs while out and about</p>

<p>John Lewis have also revealed sales are up 29 per cent compared with last year.  </p>

<p>This week, It-bag designer Telfar Clemens wore a pair of the ultra mini boots to announce that his label would collaborate with Ugg for a 2021 collection.  </p>

<p>The designer released a  teaser showing the collaboration's logo where the middle 'G' in 'UGG' becomes his famous 'TC' insignia. </p>

<p>'I've always been obsessed with a certain kind of ubiquity when something really unique ends up on everybody. </p>

<p>'What I want to do is get down to the DNA of UGG and see what genes we have in common. To get down to the core of that feeling.'</p>
