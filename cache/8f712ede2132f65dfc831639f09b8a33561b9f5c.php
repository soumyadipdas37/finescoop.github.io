<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mother of an Australian artist who was crushed by a train in New York City before contracting COVID-19 has opened up their 'hell of a year'.</p>

<p>Visaya Hoffie, 23, had a double amputation after she fell into the path of an oncoming train in Manhattan on January 11. </p>

<p>The Brisbane artist also suffered a broken back, several head wounds and severe cuts and bruises after she was run over by seven carriages. </p>

<p>Ms Hoffie and her mother, Professor Pat Hoffie, tested negative to coronavirus before leaving the U.S.</p>

<p>Visaya Hoffie, 23, had a double amputation after she fell into the path of an oncoming train in Manhattan on January 11 </p>

<p>She suffered a broken back, head wounds and several cuts and bruises after the freak subway accident</p>

<p>But the 23-year-old later tested positive after being taken to Queensland's Princess Alexandra Hospital for treatment while her mother completed mandatory hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>Prof Hoffie said she isn't dwelling on the the tragic events 2020 has brought her family. </p>

<p>'Actually the whole planet has had a hell of a year. But every day is a good day, that's the way I look at it. The rest is just data,' she told The Courier Mail. </p>

<p>Ms Hoffie hasn't let the amputation of both her legs get in the way of her art, and is working on a line of hand crafted bags with her best friend Wayan Preston.</p>

<p>'She is already getting orders for the bags. She uses responsibly sourced kangaroo leather. The brand name is lizandbetty, Elizabeth is my middle name and hers,' Prof Hoffie said. </p>

<p>Prof Hoffie, a professor emeritus at Griffith University, created a self portrait of her wearing personal protective equipment to represent when she was finally allowed to visit her daughter in hospital after weeks apart.</p>

<p>Her mother Professor Pat Hoffie said she isn't dwelling on the the tragic events 2020 has brought her family</p>

<p>The 23-year-old later tested positive after being taken to Princess Alexandra Hospital for treatment while her mother completed mandatory hotel quarantine</p>

<p>The artwork, called PPE, was on Sunday announced as a finalist for the Brisbane Portrait Prize. </p>

<p>Following her near-death fall, Ms Hoffie filed a petition at Manhattan Supreme Court seeking video footage, photos and witness accounts from the night she fell onto the tracks of the 14 St PATH station. </p>

<p>In an affidavit obtained in February, Ms Hoffie claimed she was struck twice after being left on the tracks for an extended amount of time.</p>

<p>'After the first train left the station after running me over, I was left on the tracks for another considerable period of time … until a second P.A.T.H. train came along and hit me again,' the document stated.</p>

<p>She also claimed the operator of the train should have been able to see her since she fell in a well-lit area of the tracks and was wearing bright-coloured clothing.   </p>

<p>The artist avoided being hit by a second train due to her bright pink top that captured the conductor's attention.</p>

<p>Prof Hoffie shared a photo of her daughter taken just moments before the incident wearing the shirt that she said spared her from being hit a second time.</p>

<p>'This image of her [Visaya] was taken hours before the accident,' she wrote in a Facebook post. </p>

<p>'The bright pink colour of her top is what alerted the engine driver of the second train to the fact that someone was lying across the track.</p>

<p>Ms Hoffie (left) wrote on Instagram: 'Wearing the top that saved my life. Terribly missing my sister'</p>

<p>Ms Hoffie's mother and late father Santiage Bose are both well-known in Brisbane's art scene</p>

<p>'When the first train had rolled across her unconscious body twenty minutes earlier, her black puffy jacket and black jeans had made her invisible to the driver.</p>

<p>'In the words of the investigating police, ''it's a miracle she survived.'' Please pray that she continues to survive and to heal and to come home.'</p>

<p>Ms Hoffie also took to Instagram in February to upload a photo of her outfit, captioned: 'Wearing the top that saved my life. Terribly missing my sister.'      </p>

<p>Ms Hoffie's work was showcased at the Queensland College of Fine Art's graduates collection in 2016, under the name Visaya Bose.</p>
