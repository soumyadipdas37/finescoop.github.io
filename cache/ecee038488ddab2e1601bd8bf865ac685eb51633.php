<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brexit trade talks could enter their final stages this week after both sides made key concessions.</p>

<p>If the latest round of discussions – which begin tomorrow – goes well, it is expected that negotiators will begin the process to finalise a deal.</p>

<p>However, doubts still linger in Brussels, with EU leaders and diplomats accusing London of lacking 'credible' ideas to break the deadlock.</p>

<p>Brexit trade talks could enter their final stages this week after Lord Frost (pictured), the UK's negotiator, and the EU made key concessions </p>

<p>Reports yesterday suggested that both the UK and Brussels are giving ground to avoid the double negative economic impact of coronavirus and No Deal at the end of the year.</p>

<p>Lord Frost, the UK's negotiator, and his EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, are said to be preparing to finalise details by the end of this week. </p>

<p>Should talks go well, they hope to enter 'the tunnel', in which final details of the deal will be hammered out in total secrecy over two weeks. </p>

<p>This would mean that a final agreement would be in place just after the next EU summit in Brussels in mid-October.</p>

<p>EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (pictured) and Lord Frost are said to be preparing to finalise details by the end of this week</p>

<p>Boris Johnson is believed to want a Brexit deal and is coming under pressure to secure one from Cabinet members. </p>

<p>Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, who is in charge of No Deal planning, is said to be 'terrified' of the effects of a combination of a second coronavirus wave and a failure to reach a trade deal, the Sunday Times reported.</p>

<p>Both sides are said to have made concessions that give those involved hope a deal may be reached.</p>

<p>Brussels is said to have watered down its demands for checks on the movement of goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>

<p>In return, the UK would agree to adhere to some 'baseline rules' over the use of state aid to prop up British businesses.</p>

<p>This would mean that Mr Johnson would be able to say the UK was not fully aligned to EU rules as Brussels has been demanding. </p>

<p>Both sides will then agree a dispute mechanism.</p>

<p>While No 10 officials have warned against the idea that a deal is done, members of Lord Frost's team are reported to have privately said: 'There will be a deal.'</p>

<p>In a statement, Lord Frost said: 'An agreement is still very much possible, but equally very far from certain. </p>

<p>'The last two weeks of informal talks have been relatively positive, but there remains much to be done and time is short.'</p>

<p>Boris Johnson (pictured) is believed to want a Brexit deal and is coming under pressure to secure one from Cabinet members</p>

<p>He added that the UK had insisted from the start that it wants a standard free trade agreement like Canada's, but said the EU's position had 'not been so straightforward'.</p>

<p>However, the signals from the EU were less positive yesterday, with the Irish premier Micheal Martin saying he was 'not that optimistic' about the prospect of a deal.</p>

<p>He told the i newspaper: 'The Internal Market Bill has eroded trust, it has damaged the credibility of agreements that have been entered into, namely the Withdrawal Agreement and Northern Ireland protocol.'</p>

<p>One senior EU diplomat added: 'The UK is very much spinning that they want a tunnel to explore possible ideas and avenues to strike a deal. The problem is right now there are not any that are credible.</p>

<p>'There is going to be a need of intensification of negotiations at some point. But we need to trust we won't be betrayed by the other side.'</p>

<p>Another diplomat said: 'On one hand, you could see all this positive talk coming from the British government as an indication that they are serious about getting a deal.</p>

<p>'On the other hand, they could be just preparing the ground for some kind of blame game in the event we don't find an agreement.' </p>

<p>It came as the head of the Confederation of British Industry, Carolyn Fairburn, said there was 'real concern' about the chance of No Deal at the end of the transition period.</p>

<p>She said a CBI poll showed half of firms have gone backwards with their preparations as cash reserves and stockpiles have been run down.</p>
