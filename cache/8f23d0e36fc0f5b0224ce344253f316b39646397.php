<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A New Yorker who stepped in to protect a mother and two children from a man who allegedly exposed himself to them has lashed out at city officials after the suspect was quickly released without bail. </p>

<p>Denis Goncharov, 33, rushed to the aid of the young family on September 8 when he noticed them being approached by the suspect, who he says started masturbating by their park bench.</p>

<p>He chased the man, identified by the New York Post as Justin Merritt, 34, for several blocks before the suspect dashed into a subway station. He was picked up by cops later that day. </p>

<p>Goncharov has now lamented that Merritt will remain free until his December court date. </p>

<p>'It's basically a lawless free-for-all,' he said of the city. 'Like in the movie "Joker".'  </p>

<p>Denis Goncharov, 33, rushed to the aid of the young family on September 8 when he noticed them being approached by the suspect, who he says started masturbating by their park bench</p>

<p>Goncharov, who lives in Westchester but works in finance in Manhattan, said he was eating his lunch near Pier 45 at Hudson River Park when he spotted Merritt emerge from a public restroom with his pants open. </p>

<p>He told the Post that Merritt made his way toward the mother and children and began to touch himself in a sexual way. </p>

<p>A father of two, Goncharov immediately rushed to step in. </p>

<p>'What upsets me is the kids he was exposing himself to were similar age to my daughters,' Goncharov said. 'I imagined the kids being harassed were my own.' </p>

<p>'From my recollection it was a boy and a girl, aged around seven to ten.</p>

<p>'They were sitting on the bench and looked very scared. They were similar age to my own kids, who were fortunately back home at this time.' </p>

<p>Goncharov said that the mother was trying to 'cover their eyes' but that she looked 'scared'. </p>

<p>'My dad instinct kicked in,' Goncharov added. </p>

<p>'I tried to form a human barrier by jumping in between. At this point, he backed off from the family and focused his attention on me.' </p>

<p>He said that the mother then called 911 but that Merritt began to confront Goncharov, spitting on him and picking up a brick to threaten him. </p>

<p>'He was right up close to me in a very confrontational and menacing way,' Goncharov said.</p>

<p>'In self defense, I was forced to push him away from me. At that point, he — unsuccessfully — tried to spit on me and called me "White trash".' </p>

<p>Goncharov said he picked up a traffic cone to protect himself after Merritt allegedly began 'aiming for my head' with the brick before fleeing the scene.  </p>

<p>Goncharov, pictured, has two young daughters and said that he was thinking of them when he rushed to help the family</p>

<p>As the still-exposed man rushed away, Goncharov chased him for half a mile through Greenwich Village, filming Merritt to later help with the police investigation. </p>

<p>'Nobody else attempted to intervene,' he said. </p>

<p>'I followed him for six, seven blocks all the way to Slaughtered Lamb pub, and the suspect then disappeared down into the 4th Street subway entrance.' </p>

<p>In audio of the 911 call, Goncharov is heard chasing the suspect as he tries to keep sight of him before cops arrive. </p>

<p>'He has a brick; he has a weapon … He's getting away from the scene. He exposed his penis to children — this man is a pedophile. He's a sex offender,' he states. </p>

<p>While Merritt initially escaped, police tracked him down at around 8pm that evening and he was charged with lewdness, harassment, menacing and criminal possession of a weapon for picking up the brick.  </p>

<p>The four charges are non-violent misdemeanors and so according to new bail reforms which came into effect in January, none were eligible for bail. </p>

<p>Merritt was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court the next day, September 9, where he was assigned a lawyer from the New York County Defender Services. </p>

<p>A judge then released Merritt on his own recognizance. </p>

<p>If he reoffends between now and his court date on December 8, he potentially 'could be put back in', New York County Defender Services director Sergio De La Pava told the Post.</p>

<p>Yet, Goncharov has argued that Merritt should never have been released on bail. </p>

<p>'A lunatic like this is able to re-offend again and again and without consequences,' he said.</p>

<p>'I felt sorry for the hardworking NYPD officers who often feel so powerless,' Goncharov added.</p>

<p>'The law is completely letting down innocent, law abiding citizens. Shootings, burglaries and violent crime are off the charts — and is it any wonder?'</p>

<p>According to the Post, Merritt already has a number of charges to his name including criminal possession of stolen property, trespassing, turnstyle jumping and aggravated harassment arrest. </p>
