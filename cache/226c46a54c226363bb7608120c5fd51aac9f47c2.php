<p>She's admitted to being a fan of the Bad Guy artist, revealing back in May that she's even offered her guidance.</p>

<p>Gaga told Apple Music: 'Billie swept a whole bunch of awards so I said, ‘Let’s send some flowers’. I wrote her a note. For me, it’s healing because it hurt me that I didn’t get that. I’m going to be that for someone else</p>

<p>She continued: 'I’ve had a harder time with ­older women in terms of having a female ­mentor. Other than Celine Dion and Carole King, it’s proven ­difficult to have someone who would show me the way. </p>

<p>A piece for Gretchen Wieners: Gaga said during her acceptance speech: 'I want to share this award with everybody at home tonight, everybody at home who is their own form of a Tricon. I want you to know that you can do this too'</p>

<p>'So I really hope that young female artists – or young artists of any gender identity or sexual identity – will know that I am rooting for them.'</p>
