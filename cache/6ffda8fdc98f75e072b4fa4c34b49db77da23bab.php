<p>'She's never even been up on a stage and practiced,' Kim said. 'So to see her up there, my nerves are just, I honestly start crying because I'm happy for her, but I'm so nervous for her.'</p>

<p>'So you know my name is Northie,' the girl chanted to cheers at the show. 'What are those? They are clothes. What are those? These are clothes. Wow!'</p>

<p>Pride: 'I'm so proud of how confident she is,' she said of North as she teared up</p>

<p>Now with dad Kanye on stage: 'You know, she's just so fearless, and I love that about her. And I'm such a proud mom,' said Kim</p>

<p>Kanye, 43, prepared for his Yeezy Season 8 show in the City of Lights, while Kim worried that the show might be canceled, or she might get sick due to COVID.</p>

<p>During the episode, she was seen getting fitted in a latex bodysuit sent by Balmain chief and friend Olivier Rousteing, before voicing her concerns over 'the virus'.</p>

<p>Speaking about the show in one of her confessionals, Kim said: 'Because the virus is so unknown, and you hear it just spreading, we didn't know if the fashion show was gonna happen. So our plans kept on changing every day.'</p>

<p>Fittings were delayed and clothes still being shipped, with everything running right up to the last minute, as Khloé , 36, and Scott Disick, 37, decided not to attend.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the episode, Kim extended an invitation to her family to attend Kanye's Yeezy show in Paris, and everyone seemed excited.</p>

<p>'Wait, have you guys heard about this new virus?' Kris Jenner, 64, interjected, as Kim said, 'Is it the corona one? Yeah. So, s***, so is it too scary just to be there?'</p>

<p>She reflected on whether she should make the trip. 'It is a little bit scary just thinking about traveling,' she told the cameras, 'because there's talk of the coronavirus circulating, and no one really knows a lot about it...</p>

<p>'But as of right now Fashion Week is still on, and I talked to so many friends and people that are in Paris and everyone feels super-comfortable, so I'm really excited.'</p>

<p>In the weeks leading up to the show, the news about COVID-19 grew more and more dire, and the family started to text back and forth about it on group chats.</p>

<p>Reflecting: She reflected on whether she should make the trip. 'It is a little bit scary just thinking about traveling,' she told the cameras</p>

<p>'It's all of the links,' Khloé told Scott. 'MJ to Mom: 'They're shutting down Paris.'</p>

<p>She decided not to fly to the Yeezy show because she worried the Paris airport might end up closing, which would separate her from her daughter True, two.</p>

<p>Scott agreed, noting that while Kourtney Kardashian, 41, was taking his daughter Penelope to the show, he didn't want to go and leave his other kids with a nanny.</p>

<p>Khloé told the cameras, 'Kanye is my family and I will do literally anything to support him but more and more cases are coming out in Europe every single day, and I don't want to potentially get sick. I don't want to risk getting somebody else sick. And there's talks that if travel might be banned, and if we go to Paris, we might be stuck there. And I can't take that risk with my daughter.'</p>

<p>In the next scene, Kim and Kourtney were shown eating at a restaurant in Paris with their daughters, looking at photos of how big North had gotten since their last trip.</p>

<p>'I feel like we need hand sanitizer before we eat,' Kourtney noted.</p>

<p>That night, North and Penelope ate churros, rode a carousel and danced in their rooms.</p>

<p>The next day, their moms went to church in latex looks sent over by Olivier Rousteing at Balmain, with Kim calling hers 'the coronavirus suit—no one can get in here!'</p>

<p>She had wanted to wear the tight-fitting look to the Balenciaga show, but went to attend Kanye's gospel-infused Sunday Service at the Bouffes du Nord theater beforehand.</p>

<p>Afterward, she dined with Kourtney, Kanye and pal Fajer Fahad, and admitted that her plans to go to Paris had fluctuated all week as the news got worse.</p>

<p>'I almost walked off the plane,' Kourtney said, as headlines about 'designer masks' and cancellations at Fashion Week were shown.</p>

<p>That made her recall the first time Kim met Kanye after his second Yeezy show in Paris.</p>

<p>'I didn't know where to go,' Kim said, of arriving in the city alone. 'I was like, 'You guys, I don't know what to do! I want to get him a cake to celebrate. Don't they have a Ralph's here?'</p>

<p>She'd wound up getting a small box of pastries for Kanye, and got 'kidnapped' by Fajer and a friend, who took care of her.</p>

<p>First meeting: That made her recall the first time Kim met Kanye after his second Yeezy show in Paris</p>

<p>Kim fretted for her husband, as she'd just learned that fittings were being pushed back for his show because of coronavirus, with items still being sewn and shipped over.</p>

<p>The night of the show itself, she, Kourtney and the kids rode to the event together.</p>

<p>'You wanna get some vibes and listen to some North music?' Kim asked her daughter, who shook her head. 'When are you gonna debut it to the world?'</p>

<p>'My daddy knows,' North said. 'I don't know.'</p>

<p>They got to the show at the Espace Niemeyer with only seconds to spare, and watched the models walk down the runway to the sound of cars honking—the show's 'soundtrack.'</p>

<p>All of a sudden North was onstage, singing, 'Oooh oooh,' as Kim taped her with her phone.</p>

<p>Musical North: 'My daddy knows,' North said. 'I don't know.'</p>

<p>In a confessional, she observed, 'I had no idea what the fashion show was going to look like in itself, but when Kanye asked North, 'Do you wanna sing?' I just… the nerves that I have now… '</p>

<p>Afterward, Kim and Kanye told North she'd done well, and Kourtney noted that the performance had been 'cool' to experience during such a tough time.</p>

<p>'You girls, put on hand sanitizer,' she told North and Penelope as they left the show.</p>
