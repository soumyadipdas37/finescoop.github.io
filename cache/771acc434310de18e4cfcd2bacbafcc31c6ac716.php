<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A sickening racist letter has been posted on the window of a Chinese family business in southeast Melbourne.</p>

<p>City of Monash Mayor Stuart James described the note found at the Clayton store as 'filthy and disgusting'.</p>

<p>Police are now scouring CCTV in the local area to try and identify those responsible.</p>

<p>Investigations are also underway to determine whether the letter is an isolated case or linked to a spate of vandalism in the local area.</p>

<p>'You take our jobs, our land, our business! And our lives. Please p**s off,' the racist letter said.</p>

<p>'You will never be Australian. You don't look like us and you don't accept or respect us. 'Please F<strong>k off to your own s</strong>t-filled China!'</p>

<p>The author of the poorly-written note appears to blame all Chinese descendants for the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'You have contaminated the whole world, killed millions. You are murderers. We don't want you here. We hate you Chinese,' the letter says. </p>

<p>'Why don't you bloody bird and wild animal-s**t-eating Chinese go back to where you came from. </p>

<p>'You are greedy, corrupt criminals.'</p>

<p>Mayor James condemned the anonymous author of the letter and said Australia had no tolerance for racism. </p>

<p>'The author of this cowardly anonymous, vile and pathetic attack on a fellow Australian needs to pull his/her head in,' Mr James said.  </p>

<p>'This country has been built on the back of migrants from all around the world who came here seeking a better life for them and their families.'</p>

<p>'Being born in Australia does not make you any more Australian than anyone else,' he said. Nor does it give you the right to make unprovoked racist attacks on innocent people.' </p>

<p> Investigations are also underway to determine whether the letter is an isolated case or linked to a spate of vandalism in the local area</p>

<p>The author of the poorly-written note appears to blame all Chinese descendants for the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>In a survey conducted by the Asian Australian Alliance between April 2 and June 2 this year, data revealed 'a clear pattern of racist attacks against Asians and Asian Australians as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and that they are not isolated incidents.'</p>

<p>In total, 377 cases of racism were found - including verbal attacks and racial slurs, physical acts of intimidation and some individuals of Asian descent were even coughed and sneezed at. </p>

<p>Relations between Australia and China have soured over recent months in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>The diplomatic spat has seen China slap Australia with a number of trade sanctions on beef, wine and barley, after Scott Morrison called for an independent inquiry in to the origin of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Beijing's increasing crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in the former Commonwealth colony Hong Kong, has also ratcheted up tensions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, security agencies are currently investigating alleged efforts by the Chinese government to influence Australian politics. </p>

<p>Director of the Australia-China Institute James Laurenceson told Daily Mail Australia 'it is very sad' to see the diplomatic tensions spilling over in the community. </p>

<p>'Despite the political side of the relationship being tense, the economic and the people-to-people ties provided some real strength for the relationship,' Mr Laurenceson said.</p>

<p>'These instances are a tragedy for Australia's national interest because these aspects of the relationship are what held things together.' </p>
