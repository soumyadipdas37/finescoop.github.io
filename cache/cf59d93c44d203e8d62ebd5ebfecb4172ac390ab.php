<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A promotional video for a Mazda dealership in Queensland has been ridiculed after copying TikTok's viral 'Savage' dance.  </p>

<p>Grand Prix Mazda Aspley, in Brisbane, posted the ad to social media on September 17 and declared 'September's Savage' would be a month packed with savings.  </p>

<p>The video showed three staff members performing the choreographed dance routine while one of them promoted the sale. </p>

<p>But the ad was immediately slammed by perplexed social media viewers, who declared the marketing idea missed the mark.  </p>

<p>'Omg I don't know what's worse, that the company think this marketing works or the fact these people actually did this,' one Facebook user wrote.  </p>

<p>Another said: 'Why do I feel like a middle aged man named Greg thought this would be a good idea? </p>

<p>'Probably saw his niece watching it on TikTok and thought it was an excellent sales pitch.' </p>

<p>Some social media viewers said the footage turned them off Mazda vehicles forever.  </p>

<p>'Is there a firing squad behind that camera? That is literally the only logical thing I could think of,' an amused Facebook user wrote.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately this ad has made me never want to buy a Mazda for as long as I live,' another added.</p>

<p>Others went so far as to say they wanted to return or sell their cars.</p>

<p>'Y'all just made me want to sell my Mazda,' one customer joked.</p>

<p>'Oh dear I bought my cars from these guys, I can't even watch the whole thing,' another replied.</p>

<p>In the video (pictured) three employees perform the choreographed dance while one of them touts the dealership's 'September Savage' sale</p>

<p>It wasn't all bad for the dealership, with some viewers throwing their support behind the creative advertising.</p>

<p>'Marketing strategy is working, as funny and awkward these ads are, they are actually working,' one Facebook user wrote. </p>

<p>The video has been shared almost 2,000 times and has received more than 6,000 comments. </p>

<p>The 'Savage Challenge' swept video-sharing platform TikTok at the beginning of the year, with users performing the viral dance to Megan Thee Stallion's single Savage.  </p>
