<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England's players have accepted a 25 per cent wage reduction for the 2020/21 season, the Rugby Football Union has announced.</p>

<p>The one-year arrangement with England's men follows talks between the RFU and the Rugby Players' Association as a result of the challenges posed by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney said: "I would like to thank the players and the RPA for their strong co-operation and collaboration which has enabled us to reach this new agreement.</p>

<p>England players have agreed to a wage reduction due to the effects of the covid-19 pandemic</p>

<p>"This is a special squad of players and their appreciation and understanding of the difficulties being faced across the English game has led to this outcome."</p>

<p>Under the terms of the new agreement, the RFU has made firm commitments around a range of player welfare initiatives with ongoing management of the player welfare process and clearly defined rest periods.</p>

<p>These include a one-week break after the Guinness Six Nations match against Italy in Rome on October 31, and post-England autumn matches, two weeks to be taken with their clubs.</p>

<p>There will also be the cancellation of a New Year camp and a week off during the Six Nations to replace a fallow week camp.</p>

<p>Sweeney said: "We are committed to ensuring the RFU runs a sustainable operation to safeguard the future of the game in England and are grateful to the England international playing group for their willingness to accept a reduction in fees over the next 12 months to support this.</p>

<p>"We are committed to looking after their well-being during this challenging period of fixtures."</p>

<p>England's Saracens hooker Jamie George said: "The playing group wanted to address some concerns around welfare and rest for the EPS (elite player squad) and we are encouraged by the progress made by all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Issues to do with welfare surrounding Eddie Jones' side have also been discussed and agreed</p>

<p>"We fully understand the pressures around the next 12 months both on and off the pitch, so it was vital for us to agree these provisions going forward."</p>

<p>The RFU has also confirmed they will officially partner with Restart - the charity of the RPA and players - which provides financial, practical and emotional support to professional players and their families who have suffered injury, illness or hardship.</p>

<p>RPA chief executive Damian Hopley said: "The RPA would like to place on record our thanks to the RFU for their collaboration in agreeing to this extension.</p>

<p>"It is a very challenging time for rugby in England but the EPS and RPA are very grateful this process has been conducted in good faith throughout despite these trying circumstances."</p>
