<p>This week former footballer Rio Ferdinand checks in to our travel Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>He talks about the weirdest place he's ever played football - a floating pitch in Madrid - and why the Maldives is his favourite destination for some R&amp;R.</p>

<p>Favourite place?</p>

<p>The Maldives, where the children feel like they’re having an adventure, and us parents can just kick back and relax.</p>

<p>What destination is on your travel bucket list?</p>

<p>Safari. It’s one of those experiences you want to share with loved ones.</p>

<p>Food you miss most when travelling?</p>

<p>My Mrs’s Sunday roasts [Kate Wright, pictured above with Rio].</p>

<p>The most unusual thing you’ve eaten?</p>

<p>A durian fruit in Myanmar. It was seriously stinky.</p>

<p>Any memorable travel mishaps?</p>

<p>As a youngster, I was travelling to Las Vegas with mates and we had a lay-over. One of my mates ended up getting too drunk to be allowed on the plane so none of our group could board. </p>

<p>We had to wait for seven hours but we enjoyed a few more drinks and ended up missing the next flight, too.</p>

<p>Rio said his favourite place is the Maldives, where 'the children feel like they’re having an adventure, and us parents can just kick back and relax'</p>

<p>Weirdest place you’ve played football?</p>

<p>A mock-up pitch before a Champions League final in Madrid. They made a floating pitch out on the water. Playing on that was crazy.</p>

<p>Ultimate fantasy holiday?</p>

<p>Three types of holidays in one trip — first a beach break, then a week in the mountains enjoying the snow and, finally, a safari.</p>
