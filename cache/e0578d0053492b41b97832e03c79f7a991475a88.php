<p>In posts on Instagram Stories, the network shared a series of seemingly unassuming photos of Locky Gilbert and his two finalists, Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska from the finale.</p>

<p>But a closer look reveals the 31-year-old Bachelor's pocket square is a perfect match with Irena's brown animal print dress.</p>

<p>Oops: Just hours out from The Bachelor finale on Thursday, the show may have inadvertently given away the winner. Pictured, Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>The fabric used to create Locky's pocket square appears to have come from a cut off of Irena's sweeping floor-length gown, suggesting he picks the 31-year-old nurse.</p>

<p>The outgoing Bachelor even stuck to a similar colour palette as the Bachelor favourite, opting for a cream-coloured suit and white shirt.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bella, 25, is set to look equally glamorous in a strapless purple ball gown with a floor-length tulle skirt for the finale. </p>

<p>Telling clue: A closer look reveals the 31-year-old Bachelor's pocket square is a perfect match with Irena Srbinovska's brown animal print dress</p>

<p>According to an article on Medium back in February 2018, it's common for men to try and match their partner with something like a pocket square: 'Nothing says you're together quite like coordinating outfits.' </p>

<p>'The easiest and most noticeable way to match your date is to grab a colour from their ensemble and make it your pop of colour!' they added. </p>

<p>'For example, if you see your partner is wearing a great salmon pink dress, add an upgraded pocket square to your look.'</p>

<p>Irena has been a favourite to win Locky's heart since the beginning of this year's season, with the handsome Bachelor regularly talking about their connection.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Herald Sun on Thursday, Irena confessed she'd be 'heartbroken' if Locky chose Bella, after falling hard for him.</p>

<p>'I have fallen head over heels crazy for Locky, I see him as my future partner, my husband, the father of my children,' she revealed.  </p>
