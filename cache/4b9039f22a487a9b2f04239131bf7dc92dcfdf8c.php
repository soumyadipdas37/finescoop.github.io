<p>Britain is more divided over the virus than it was about Brexit, according to think tank Demos' online poll of 10,061 adults taken between 31 July and 7 August.</p>

<p>Britain is more divided over the virus than it was about Brexit, according to think tank Demos' online poll (pictured: police speak to demonstrators in breach of lockdown rules in May)</p>

<p>It showed 68 per cent of people who did not break lockdown rules have strong negative feelings towards those who did.</p>

<p>In comparison, only 33 per cent of people who voted Remain in the Brexit referendum feel animosity towards Leave voters, and 20 per cent of Leavers showed resentment towards Remainers.</p>

<p>The survey also considered issues reported during lockdown, with access to green space being cited as one of the most important problems.</p>

<p>Other issues included challenges facing the social care system, health inequality, the benefits system, educational inequalities and air pollution.</p>

<p>Polly Mackenzie, Chief Executive of Demos, said: 'In many ways, the Covid-19 pandemic has helped communities, neighbours and wider society come together. </p>

<p>'But our new research has found that there is also a more concerning picture that has arisen. The social divisions caused by the pandemic are stark, but we must work to ensure that these divisions don't fracture society in the long-term.</p>

<p>'Our project, Renew Normal, wants to hear from people up and down the country about their views on how Britain should build back from Covid-19. </p>

<p>'We hope that bringing people together for a national conversation to shape Britain's future will help heal the divides, find common ground and take forward the best of the community spirit gained through the health crisis.'</p>

<p>The research also found that 58 per cent of people who wear masks in the UK have 'severely negative attitudes' towards those who do not (pictured: commuters on the Jubilee line in June)</p>

<p>It comes as the number of people that can attend social gatherings will be slashed in England following a rise in coronavirus cases. </p>

<p>Gatherings of more than six people either indoors and outdoors, at home or in a pub will be illegal from Monday. </p>

<p>A single household or support bubble that is larger than six will still be able to gather.</p>

<p>Covid-secure venues like places of worship, gyms, restaurants and hospitality settings can still hold more than six in total. </p>

<p>Education and work settings are not affected by the new rules.</p>

<p>Weddings and funerals can still go ahead with a limit of 30 people if conducted in a Covid-secure way.</p>
