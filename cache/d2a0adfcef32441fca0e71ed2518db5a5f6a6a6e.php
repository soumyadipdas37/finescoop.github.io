<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Trainer Andrew Balding says The Queen's two-year-old Tactical with have another shot at a group one target when he runs in the Juddmonte Middle Park Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday.</p>

<p>Tactical landed the Windsor Castle Stakes at Royal Ascot and the July Stakes at Newmarket but a run on soft ground in the Group One Prix Morny at Deauville did not work out.</p>

<p>The colt also bred by the Queen first found himself racing away from the main pack as the field split into two groups and then had his forward momentum checked as he made a move before finishing fifth to Campanelle.</p>

<p>The Queen's horse, Tactical, will get another shot at a group one target this weekend</p>

<p>The two-year-old colt had a poor run in Morny at Deauville in July but will get another shot</p>

<p>Balding said: 'Tactical has won on Newmarket's July course, is in good form and will hopefully run a good race. The run in the Prix Morny was not ideal. The ground was not to his liking and it didn't happen for him but he has come out of it well.'</p>

<p>Opposition in the Middle Park includes Owen Burrows-trained Gimcrack Stakes winner Minzaal.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Balding's 2,000 Guineas winner Kameko, on course to run in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day at Ascot on October 17, looks like having an unexpected prep run in Friday's Group Two Joel Stakes at Newmarket.</p>

<p>Tactical has won on Newmarket before and his trainer, Andrew Balding, says he is in good form</p>

<p>Balding added: 'It's a long wait until Champions Day. That is very much our target but we feel a run beforehand will help our cause. He will have to carry a group one penalty and give weight to Benbatl. That will not be easy. He might have to put in a career best effort to win.'</p>

<p>Balding's St Leger runner-up Berkshire Rocco has been pencilled in to run in the Listed Noel Murless Stakes at Ascot on October 2.</p>
