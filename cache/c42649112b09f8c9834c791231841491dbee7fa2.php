<p>He continued: 'Please don't let the governments turn this into a 'new normal' otherwise your kids kids will be asking u why didn't you allow this c*** and where did our freedoms go? </p>

<p>'The hairdresser in question obviously took the scare mongering to a whole new level which unfortunately is where society is going unless we stand for our freedoms back.' </p>

<p>The Government guidelines state that 'children under the age of 11' are exempt from wearing a mask in settings where face coverings are required in England. </p>

<p>'That Bill Gates wants to force us all to get vaccinated so he can take over the world. </p>

<p>'That's so stupid. There're so many things in Britain that threaten your freedom, Brexit etc. Why not fume at that?'</p>

<p>Howard responded to the Twitter user and shared his view that 'freedom is maskless'. </p>

<p>He continued: 'You think it's stupid that they are trying to get everyone feared for their lives so people actually beg for a vaccine? </p>

<p>'That's the way it's going. Freedom is maskless and to breath true oxygen and go where u want to go without people looking at u like u are a disease.'  </p>

<p>The father-of-four, who has two daughters from previous relationships and Bowie Taylan, five, with Katie, said he would homeschool his children if masks were introduced. </p>

<p>However the singer was also slammed by a follower with a lung condition who claimed he had a 'blasé attitude towards the virus'.</p>

<p>Acknowledgements: Howard revealed how he understood the necessity 'for the old and vulnerable to wear them' but gestured to the 'bigger picture'.</p>

<p>In response to Howard, they penned: 'With 2/3 lung capacity and a damaged nervous system affecting my breathing, your blasé attitude towards the virus, which genuinely has the potential to kill me or change my life forever, scares me more than the government and media. Please think about the reality of this virus.' </p>

<p>Yet Howard revealed how he acknowledge the necessity 'for the old and vulnerable to wear them' but gestured to the 'bigger picture'.</p>

<p>He replied: Of course! I've already mentioned it's understandable for the old and vulnerable to wear them to stay safe. </p>

<p>'It's about the bigger picture and the control governments are having on the masses. Massive lockdowns where people aren't even allowed out affecting mental health.' </p>

<p>Howard claimed Microsoft founder Bill Gates has patents on vaccines and viruses themselves.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he wrote: 'I think I'm gonna delete Twitter for a few weeks before I really say what I think.</p>

<p>'Not saying things to wind people up,I'm just saying it because there is a bigger picture behind this and if we don't educate, humans will have freedoms taken away.</p>

<p>'I care for humans, especially kids.'</p>
