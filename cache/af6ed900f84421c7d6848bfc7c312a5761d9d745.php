<p>The Brazil international moved to Stamford Bridge on a free transfer earlier this summer after leaving Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>Silva took part in his first training session as a Chelsea player on Thursday after having extra time off following PSG's Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard has hailed the leadership qualities of new signing Thiago Silva</p>

<p>The Brazilian moved to Stamford Bridge on a free transfer from PSG this summer</p>

<p>Silva only took part in his first training session on Thursday but his impact is already being felt</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Lampard will play the 35-year-old against Premier League champions Liverpool on Sunday but the Chelsea boss was clearly impressed by his new man. </p>

<p>Lampard said: 'Certainly a leader. He'll bring that with him by nature.</p>

<p>'He doesn't speak the language that great at the moment but we'll work on that. </p>

<p>'By presence, by attitude in training and quality of the player, he commands respect and it is great having him around. That's all you can ask for as a coach.'  </p>

<p>The game against Liverpool offers an early test of Chelsea's title credentials this season after they spent around £230m in the transfer window to strengthen.</p>

<p>It will also be the first game that Lampard locks horns with Jurgen Klopp since the pair were involved in an angry confrontation at Anfield back in July. </p>

<p>Lampard insists he has nothing but respect for Jurgen Klopp following their touchline spat</p>

<p>Lampard accused Klopp’s coaching staff of crossing a line and showing a lack of respect by leaping up, shouting and smirking at him during Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat at Anfield earlier this summer. </p>

<p>Klopp moved to clear the air in his press conference on Friday and Lampard echoed those sentiments, insisting he had nothing but respect for the German.</p>

<p>Lampard added: 'Against Liverpool they are always going to give you a tough match.</p>

<p>'We have to push our limits to close that gap and that's the challenge in front of us. </p>

<p>'I reiterate what Klopp said. I've got huge respect for him as a manager and what he's done at Liverpool.</p>

<p>'That's on him as the focal point of the club and the talent they've brought in.</p>

<p>'The nature of the 90 minutes can always boil over but the respect I have for Klopp will never change.'</p>
