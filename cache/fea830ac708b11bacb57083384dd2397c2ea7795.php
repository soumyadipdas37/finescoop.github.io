<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mother of Julian Assange's children has opened up about the couple's prison wedding plans and her push for Australian citizenship.</p>

<p>South African-born lawyer Stella Morris and Assange began dating in 2015 after she helped work on a legal bid to halt his extraditions.  </p>

<p>The 49-year-old Australian faces espionage charges over the leaking of hundreds of thousands of classified U.S. intelligence documents. </p>

<p>He was also wanted in Sweden after being accused of rape. Assange always denied the sex allegations, which have now been dropped.</p>

<p>Gabriel, three, and his brother Max, one, were conceived while Assange was hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.</p>

<p>'It was a rational decision, I was 33 at the time and I knew I wanted children and it was faith in our love for each other and the certainty, a feeling that this was right,' Ms Morris told Sydney Morning Herald.  </p>

<p>The WikiLeaks founder was granted political asylum by Ecuador in 2012 until April 2019 when he was dragged out and taken to prison. </p>

<p>Ms Morris said she plans to marry Assange outside Belmarsh Prison in London's outskirts by Christmas this year.</p>

<p>The couple's children visited Assange in prison last month and Ms Morris tries to keep him 'present' in their lives by talking about him and watching videos.  </p>

<p>'I don't want Julian to become a martyr. We're a family, he's not a symbol to us. He's part of ... he's Daddy. So I just tell them that Daddy's coming home,' she said. </p>

<p>But Ms Morris is aware there is a chance the children will never be reunited with their father again.  </p>

<p>She would love to move to Australia - as long as the government can protect her family. </p>

<p>'I'll live wherever he is safe and that's why I want Australia to tell us that he will be safe there,' she said. </p>

<p>Gabriel, three, and his brother Max, one, were conceived while Assange was hiding out in the Ecuadorian embassy in London</p>

<p>Ms Morris said she asked Prime Minister Scott Morrison for political intervention but claims she was told they won't protect Assange from extradition.  </p>

<p>Assange's partner previously lifted the lid on how the couple managed to have children while he was holed up inside the embassy.</p>

<p>'We grew closer and became friends and watched movies together and I just loved spending time with him. It was very romantic and cautious and very sweet,' she told 60 Minutes earlier this year.</p>

<p>'It wasn't easy but when you're with someone you love you can make impossible situations possible.'</p>

<p>When Gabriel was conceived in 2016, Assange had been inside the embassy for four years and was thought to be under constant surveillance by American security services.</p>

<p>But Ms Morris said she and Assange - who became engaged in 2017 - conceived both their sons in rooms of the embassy that didn't have CCTV cameras.</p>

<p>'Julian had private spaces, his bedroom and office had no cameras,' she said.</p>

<p>'But when I got pregnant the first time there were microphones everywhere, so I had to write it down on a piece of paper to tell him.</p>

<p>'We loved each other, and we wanted to start a family. All these other circumstances would change but that was a certainty. I got pregnant and we were over the moon,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Morris was able to hide both her pregnancies from authorities and the media, who still weren't privy to any romantic relationship between the pair.</p>

<p>'I just piled on layers [of clothes] and complained about getting fat to hide it,' she said.</p>
