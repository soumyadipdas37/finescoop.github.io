<p>Looking fab: Brooke Shields was an ageless femme fatale as she posed up a storm for some evocative Instagram snapshots.</p>

<p>Brooke flaunted her assets in her high-cut one-piece, letting her straps slide evocatively off her shoulders.</p>

<p>'A great friend and a dream collaborator,' she wrote, adding: 'thank you for believing in my vision and helping bring it to life,' and tagging Helena.</p>

<p>After becoming a star as a model Helena also broke into photography and has previously snapped Brooke for Reserved magazine.</p>

<p>The dynamic duo have been friends for some time apparently as they were seen chatting amiably in New York a couple of years ago.</p>

<p>Brooke, who used to be Mrs. Andre Agassi, has been married since 2001 to screenwriter Chris Henchy who often works with Will Ferrell.</p>

<p>The Suddenly Susan star and her husband are the proud parents of two daughters, 17-year-old Rowan and 14-year-old Grier.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Helena has gone through three divorces and shares her 20-year-old son Mingus with her second ex-husband Norman Reedus. </p>

<p>During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live last year, Brooke told Andy Cohen that she is 'afraid of' having plastic surgery.</p>

<p>'But I also like wanna do everything I can to just look my best and feel my best, so I recently discovered - I think it's like a trick, it's like a resource,' she said.</p>

<p>Brooke has turned to a body treatment called warm-sculpting, aka SculpSure, a non-invasive procedure in which lasers are used to burn away fat cells.</p>

<p>Last April she was announced as a spokeswoman for SculpSure, which has been cleared by the Food And Drug Administration.</p>

<p>What a pair: Helena previously snapped Brooke for Reserved; they are pictured at the launch party for its third issue at New York's Jane Hotel in 2015</p>
