<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bare majority in battleground states considers President Donald Trump mentally unfit to be president and a similar percentage feels the same way about Democratic rival Joe Biden, according to a new poll.</p>

<p>Voters are nearly evenly split, 51 to 49 per cent, on whether Trump is mentally unfit to be president. </p>

<p>A nearly identical margin, 52 percent to 48 per cent, consider Biden mentally unfit, the CNBC / Change Research poll found.</p>

<p>A bare majority of swing state voters considers President Trump mentally unfit for office. A similar margin said the same about former Vice President Joe Biden</p>

<p>The results follow months of attacks by Trump on Biden's mental capacity. Trump regularly insults Biden as 'sleepy Joe' and has hounded him for riding out much of the summer in his basement, which Biden used for TV appearances and media interviews, amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>The poll queried voters in Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Polls in those same states the outfit released Wednesday showed Biden leading in every one of the battlegrounds.</p>

<p>A bare 52 per cent majority considers Trump physically fit for the job, compared to 54 per cent for Biden. Trump is 74 and Biden is 77. </p>

<p>Biden in a CNN interview that aired Thursday pledged to be 'totally transparent' about his own health as he ripped Trump for his insults.</p>

<p>'Thank God I am in good health. But here's the deal. Anything can happen,' he said. </p>

<p>'When it comes to Donald Trump versus me, just look at us, okay? Just look at us. Who seems to be in shape? Who's able to move around? I mean this idea of "Slow Joe." Anyway, I shouldn't laugh about it, because, anyway ... Donald Trump. Just look at us both,' he said.  </p>

<p>The president boasted about 'acing' his mental cognition test but has refused to reveal detailed information about his unannounced trip to Walter Reed Medical Center last November. </p>

<p>Trump took to twitter early this month to deny having a series of 'mini-strokes.'</p>

<p>“It never ends! Now they are trying to say that your favorite President, me, went to Walter Reed Medical Center, having suffered a series of mini-strokes,' Trump wrote. </p>
