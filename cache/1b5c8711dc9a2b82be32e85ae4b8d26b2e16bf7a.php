<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An old bucket factory has been converted into a trendy three-storey house on the outskirts of Sydney CBD, complete with upstairs and downstairs living rooms, antique timber beams and a rear made entirely of glass.</p>

<p>Built in the 1880s, 38 Foucart Street is regarded as a local landmark in Rozelle in the city's inner-west, and has been used as a church mission hall and photography studio since it was built roughly 140 years ago.</p>

<p>After falling into disrepair in the second half of the 20th century, the dilapidated warehouse was bought for $950,000 in 2002 by private owners who hired an architect to transform it into a modern family home.</p>

<p>The result of the redesign is a four-bedroom, two-bathroom semi-detached residence overlooking the city skyline, still fronted with the original brickwork and double door of the factory facade.</p>

<p>Old and new blend seamlessly in the renovated industrial block, where a living room flooded with natural light sits beneath period timber ceiling beams</p>

<p>Spread over 173 square metres, the renovated house is described as a 'sanctuary where space, style and privacy' are equally balanced.</p>

<p>This is thanks to features like a quiet upstairs living room - perfect for study and reading - and a landscaped garden patio.</p>

<p>Other standout features include a wine cellar and off-street parking.</p>

<p>Listing agent Cindy Kennedy from McGrath realtors called it 'one of the most unique' houses to come up for sale in central Sydney for many years. </p>
