<p>The Hammers already look like a club destined to struggle after opening their Premier League campaign with a 2-0 home defeat by Newcastle.</p>

<p>The fixture list has not been kind to manager David Moyes with Arsenal, Wolves, Leicester, Tottenham, Manchester City and Liverpool all to come before October is out.</p>

<p>Ryan Fredericks believes West Ham can pick up points from their daunting run of fixtures</p>

<p>But right-back Fredericks told the club website: 'I think we're a team who it doesn't matter who we're playing against, it's more about us on the day.</p>

<p>'We did well against some of the top six and top eight teams last season and I'm sure we'll do it again.</p>

<p>'We ended last season well, we were flying, and we've come back and we've been training well and training hard and trying to do the same things, but Saturday definitely wasn't good enough.</p>

<p>'We had the exactly same team that went and dominated most games at the back end of last season, even when we were playing some of the top teams in the league, but we just weren't at it.</p>

<p>West Ham are preparing for their Carabao Cup clash against Charlton on Tuesday night</p>
