<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump said Thursday morning that he is at a disadvantage in the upcoming debates against Joe Biden due to the 77-year-old Democratic nominee's near-half century of experience in Washington D.C.</p>

<p>'I think I'm the one without experience,' Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade during a live call-in on his radio show. 'He's been doing this for 47 years plus.'</p>

<p>'He has a tremendous advantage if you think about it,' the president continued, then employed his critical nickname of his primary competitor. 'The guy with the advantage is sleepy Joe Biden.'</p>

<p>Biden served as a U.S. Senator from Delaware for 36 years and immediately following served for eight years as Barack Obama's vice president.</p>

<p>Trump's first foray into public service was winning the 2016 presidential election.</p>

<p>The 74-year-old president and Biden will face-off in their first in-person matchup on Tuesday in Cleveland, Ohio where Fox News host Chris Wallace will host the first debate of the 2020 general election season.</p>

<p>Donald Trump insisted Thursday he is at a 'tremendous disadvantage' in the presidential debates where he will face-off against Joe Biden</p>

<p>'I think I'm the one without experience,' Trump told Fox News host Brian Kilmeade during a live call-in on his radio show. 'He's been doing this for 47 years plus'</p>

<p>The president has done several one-on-one interviews with the 'Fox News Sunday' host who is known for grilling his political interviewees.</p>

<p>Biden, however, has been invited several times to sit down with Wallace and has declined to do so â€“ as he continues to dodge many live interview television requests.</p>

<p>Kilmeade suggested Trump could have an advantage in the first debate since he has become used to Wallace questioning style and is more familiar personally with the host.</p>

<p>Trump pushed back against this claim.</p>

<p>'Chris likes me because his world is all about ratings,' Trump insisted, adding that his interviews with Wallace draw large viewership.</p>

<p>'I would be willing to bet that he won't ask Biden tough questions,' he continued to Kilmeade, insulting his fellow Fox News host.</p>

<p>'But he'll be controlled by the radical left,' Trump said of Wallace.</p>

<p>Kilmeade defended his colleague: 'I can tell you for sure that he's not controlled by anyone.'</p>

<p>There are two other presidential debates before the election on November 3.</p>

<p>Trump and Biden will meet in Miami, Florida on the evening of Thursday, October 15, where C-SPAN's Steve Scully will moderate the town hall meeting format for the debate.</p>

<p>The third and final debate will be held in Nashville, Tennessee October 22 and will be hosted by NBC's Kirsten Welker.</p>
