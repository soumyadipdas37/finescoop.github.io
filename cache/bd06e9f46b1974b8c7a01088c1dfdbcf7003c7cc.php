<p>Ashley ultimately assured Candiace and Gizelle that she would address the text messages with Michael.Â </p>

<p>'So, I will take this information. I hear what you're saying. I will talk to my husband about it,' Ashley shared.'I will get to the bottom of it, and I will see if there's some truth to it.'</p>

<p>The rumors are nothing new for Ashley as Michael said he would stop going to strip clubs after he allegedly came home smelling like perfume several months ago.Â Â </p>

<p>She opened up about a past occurrence that took place with Michael, 59, when he returned home from a strip club.</p>

<p>Ashley said 'I don't just ask questions, Candiace. I reads emails, text messages, I sniff underwear, everything.' when Candiace asked if she asked Michael directly about rumors</p>

<p>Shock admission: Candiace looked at Ashley in disbelief while Gizelle struggled to stifle her giggles under her sweater</p>

<p>The latest:Â Ashley, 32, revealed on Sunday's edition of the reality series that her husband Michael 59, was previously involved in an incident at a strip club in which 'this one woman kept touching him'</p>

<p>'One time, he did come home, smelling like perfume,' she said. 'I was upset and he was like, "I'm sorry I was at the strip club." I was pregnant and I was very sensitive.'</p>

<p>She said that after she asked him not to do it again, she presumed he 'stopped going to strip clubs.'</p>

<p>Ashley said that Michael told her 'he was at a strip club' in the incident, which took place when she and their one-year-old son Dean were at co-star Monique Samuels' house for a cast trip.</p>

<p>Candiace later revealed to Ashley an image of Michael at the strip club.</p>

<p>Parenthood: The couple are parents to son Dean, one, and expecting another baby</p>

<p>Ashley said that she and her spouse 'talked about the issue that Candiace brought up, and he told me he was at the strip club and this woman kept touching him.'</p>

<p>She said that tensions ran high and they slept in separate rooms, 'Michael slept in the baby's room and I slept in the bedroom.'</p>

<p>She said her husband 'regrets' his actions, which he didn't specify, and 'feels bad' about it.</p>

<p>On the show, Candiace, 33, said she'd received pictures of Michael 'in his boxers' at a hotel. Gizelle, 50, told Candiace, 'I'm minding my business and I had at least 40 DMs about Michael; this is the worst!'</p>

<p>Candiace said there was now 'photographic evidence of Michael at a hotel, Michael at the strip club and Michael at MGM.'</p>

<p>The show's Karen Huger said of the image, 'Michael doing something, but it don't look like it's Ashley.'</p>

<p>Monique, 36, said that 'in the big scheme of it all, the only person that matters right now is baby Dean.'</p>

<p>Robyn Dixon suggested that Michael show better restraint and 'go home to [his] wife.'Â </p>

<p>Previously, a cameraman on their reality series publicly claimed in 2018 that Michael had groped him during filming.</p>

<p>Out and about: Ashley joined (L-R) Robyn Dixon, Wendy Osefo, Gizelle Bryant and Charrisse Jackson-Jordan for Bryant's birthday in Washington, DC on Saturday</p>

<p>Charges of felony assault and misdemeanor improper sexual conduct were filed against him but later dropped due to a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>'When I got the news, I just froze,' Ashley said on RHOP while delving into the matter. 'It was not real that something like this was happening to my husband and I. My heart was racing, I was getting light headed. Like, this just canâ€™t be my reality.'</p>

<p>Last year, Michael was alleged to have made a sexual comment about one of Housewives' husbands.</p>

<p>'After the night died down, Michael walked past us and said, "Yeah, I would suck his d***,''' Dixon told Ashley on the show. 'You were there. You all were walking past us.'</p>

<p>Despite one of her fellow Housewives claiming Michael said it, Ashley adamantly denied he'd made the comment.Â </p>
