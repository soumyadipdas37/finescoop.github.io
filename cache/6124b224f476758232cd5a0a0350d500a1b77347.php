<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An aide to fugitive Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn pleaded not guilty to hiding tens of millions of dollars for his boss today as the trial against him began in Tokyo. </p>

<p>Greg Kelly denies an $87million conspiracy charge in a saga which has gripped the business world since Ghosn's arrest nearly two years ago.</p>

<p>Ghosn is at large after his spectacular escape from Japan last year - hiding in an instrument case to flee to Lebanon - leaving Kelly as the only person facing trial. </p>

<p>The trial, expected to last ten months, turns on whether Kelly concealed payments of 9.2billion yen ($87million) which were promised to Ghosn on his retirement. </p>

<p>Greg Kelly (pictured), an aide to ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, arrives at the Tokyo District Court for the first day of his trial today </p>

<p>Nissan itself is on trial over the same charges, and the company has pleaded guilty and is paying a 2.4billion yen ($23million) fine.     </p>

<p>But Kelly entered a not guilty plea on Tuesday, saying: 'I deny the allegations. I was not involved in a criminal conspiracy.' </p>

<p>Kelly, who faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted, says no final agreement was made on any post-retirement pay and therefore no disclosure was legally required.</p>

<p>The 64-year-old wore a mask as he entered the Tokyo court dressed in a dark suit and red striped tie today.   </p>

<p>Inside the courtroom, he described Ghosn as an 'extraordinary executive' who brought Nissan back from the brink of bankruptcy and was considered a 'retention risk' because rules introduced in Japan from 2010 limited executive pay.</p>

<p>He said various options for additional pay to Ghosn were considered, and he 'took it for granted' that any compensation would be 'lawful'.</p>

<p>'The evidence will show I did not break the law,' Kelly added.  </p>

<p>Nissan and Japanese prosecutors disagree, arguing they have evidence that future payments were pledged to Ghosn and should have been disclosed in filings. </p>

<p>Ghosn too has vigorously defended himself, maintaining his innocence since he was first arrested and sacked as Nissan boss in November 2018.   </p>

<p>After being released on $9million bail in March 2019, he was re-arrested in a dawn raid a month later and hit with fresh charges. </p>

<p>In September last year, US securities regulators accused Ghosn and Nissan of hiding more than $140million in expected retirement income from investors. </p>

<p>Ghosn was bailed a second time and banned from leaving Japan, but gave authorities the slip by hiding in an instrument case and flying to Lebanon just before New Year's Eve. </p>

<p>A week after his sensational escape, he gave a press conference claiming Nissan colluded with prosecutors to have him arrested because he wanted to deepen the Japanese firm's alliance with Renault.  </p>

<p>Ghosn said he fled because he did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan, which does not have an extradition treaty with Lebanon. </p>

<p>Prosecutors have amassed a vast trove of documents, only a small portion of which have been given to the defence so far, according to Kelly's lawyers.</p>

<p>His defence team say they had 'no choice' but to proceed with the trial because Kelly - who has been out on bail in Tokyo since December 2018 - is separated from most of his family while he waits for his case to go to court.</p>

<p>His wife Dee has stayed in Tokyo with him and told reporters it was 'disappointing' that Ghosn would not be testifying.</p>

<p>'But he is not here and he made the choice and he had to make that choice,' she said.</p>

<p>'He is going to have to deal with the consequences of the choice he made.'</p>

<p>Kelly's legal team say they are confident he can be acquitted - despite the track record of Japan's prosecutors, who win over 99 per cent of the criminal cases they bring to court.</p>

<p>But they argue they have been put at a strong disadvantage by the court's refusal to allow overseas witnesses to testify by videoconference.</p>

<p>Nissan has been tight-lipped about the trial, with a source close to the firm's leadership saying there was concern about negative media attention.</p>

<p>The witness list includes a number of top former or current Nissan executives, including Kelly's former colleague Hari Nada, who obtained whistleblower status from prosecutors in exchange for his cooperation.</p>

<p>Former CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced out over financial improprieties discovered by an internal investigation in the wake of the Ghosn scandal, will also give testimony.</p>
