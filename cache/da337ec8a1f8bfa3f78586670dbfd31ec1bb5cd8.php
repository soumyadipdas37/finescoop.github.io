<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of Australians are taking advantage of a quarantine loophole to avoid COVID-19 restrictions and state border closures.</p>

<p>Since July 17, 62,974 people have entered the Northern Territory, which has zero active coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>The figure is equivalent to a quarter of the population in Australia's Top End, or almost half Darwin's population. </p>

<p>Interstate travellers are only required to undertake two weeks of quarantine in the NT if they're travelling from or through a declared hotspot.</p>

<p>Once the two weeks is up, they are then free to travel anywhere in Australia. </p>

<p>Territory chief minister Michael Gunner said there were 700 COVID refugees in quarantine at Howard Springs (pictured)</p>

<p>Mr Gunner said many have described the facility as 'great' and 'better than a hotel'. Pictured: Two women at Howard Springs (left) and buildings at the facility (right)</p>

<p>The mandatory stay at Howards Spring costs $2,500 per person or $5,000 for a family of two or more sharing the accommodation. </p>

<p>Many are fleeing to the Territory to wait out the pandemic or quarantine before heading to the AFL finals in Queensland. </p>

<p>The facility, just south-west of Darwin, has received the tick of approval from many passing through.</p>

<p>Some have described it as 'great' and 'better than a hotel', according to chief minister Michael Gunner.</p>

<p>He labelled the NT as 'the safest place in Australia' and said there were currently 700 people in quarantine at Howard Springs.  </p>

<p>Two Victorian teachers who fled their home state told Mr Gunner they 'loved it', and were working remotely.</p>

<p>'So sorry Dan, we're taking your Victorians, this is a much better place to live and she's relocated to the Territory to teach her primary school kids,' Mr Gunner told news.com.au. </p>

<p>Australians arriving in the Northern Territory can travel anywhere else in the country once they clear the 14-day quarantine. Pictured: People arriving at an airport</p>

<p>A Darwin resident added: 'My new housemate is a Victorian public servant who has moved here for a month without telling her boss. They assume she is working from home, which she is. From my house!'</p>

<p>'If you're safe, you're welcome here and we want you here. We have great weather, great people and no coronavirus,' Mr Gunner said.</p>

<p>One of the COVID refugees staying at Howard Springs is Australian hip-hop artist Illy, who celebrated his birthday on site on Sunday.</p>

<p>In a post the 35-year-old uploaded to Facebook, Illy can be seen sprawlled out on a bed with balloons and tinsel to celebrate the occasion.</p>

<p>His post read: 'birthdays in quarantine hit different.' </p>

<p>The rapper, who released his new album Loose Ends in July, flew up from Victoria to play at Rebound - taking place at the Darwin Ski Club - on October 3.</p>

<p>Illy will be playing alongside acts including Lime Cordiale, Hot Dub Time Machne and Hermitude.</p>

<p>'This time last week I got a last minute offer to play a show. An actual f<strong>king show, holy sh*t. The catch - gotta do 2 weeks of quarantine first. Rough deal right. Maybe normally, but what the f</strong>k is normal in 2020,' he wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday.</p>

<p>'Amongst everything else, it's been the longest space between shows since my first time on stage. That's been my life forever. I miss it. So, hi Darwin, live from day 1 of quarantine. See you at Rebound, October 3. Single tear.' </p>

<p>Illy's celebratory post in COVID-19 quarantine even attracted a shout-out from Mr Gunner.</p>

<p>'We're seeing heaps of Australians from across the country come to the Territory, quarantine for 2 weeks to keep our community safe, and then enjoy our great Territory lifestyle,' Mr Gunenr said in a Facebook post.</p>

<p>'And I'm glad it means contributing to our music scene too. </p>

<p>'We're all very excited to have you up here to play at REBOUND 2020 in October. Here's to the Territory.'  </p>
