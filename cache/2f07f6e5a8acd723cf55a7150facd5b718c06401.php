<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid stars have been frustrated by Zinedine Zidane's recent tactical changes this season, according to reports from Spain. </p>

<p>Los Blancos have had a difficult summer and are being hit hard by financial implications caused by the coronavirus pandemic - being unable to sign a single player in this window, with Zidane forced to utilise his squad depth. </p>

<p>Madrid secured a narrow 1-0 win at home to Real Valladolid on Wednesday night thanks to substitute Vinicius Jr's second half strike, and the Frenchman raised eyebrows by rotating his side and picking a 4-4-2 diamond set-up.</p>

<p>Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has reportedly left his players confused by recent changes </p>

<p>He decided to play wantaway Luka Jovic and Karim Benzema up front in their win v Valladolid</p>

<p>He insisted the team was going to 'continue changing' as he attempts to experiment to find the best system for his side without any transfers incoming, and Marca claim that the first team have been left baffled by his tinkering. </p>

<p>The report says Zidane's ideas are 'misleading everyone' and points out how attacking midfielder Martin Odegaard was picked to start the 3-2 win at Real Betis before being dropped in favour of Isco. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rodrygo started the season opener against Real Sociedad but failed to feature in the next two games. And despite huge speculation linking him with a move away from Madrid, Luka Jovic has started alongside Karim Benzema for the previous two matches. </p>

<p>The Frenchman has rotated his squad heavily in their first three games of the LaLiga season </p>

<p>And Zidane shuffled his pack further by dropping Dani Carvajal for Alvaro Odriozola, with Marcelo coming in on the other flank in place of Ferland Mendy.</p>

<p>But Marca adds that Vinicius Jr has been the player most affected by the recent changes, with the Brazilian already used to 'appearing and disappearing from the team. He started against Sociedad but was an unused substitute at Betis before his goalscoring cameo against Valladolid. </p>

<p>It suggests that Vinicius Jr should have earned a starting spot at Levante on Sunday after his heroics, but says 'with Zidane you never know'. </p>

<p>Vinicius scored the winner against Valladolid but has been unable to nail down a regular spot</p>

<p>The legendary coach has already used 21 players so far in this campaign in a major sign of his reluctance to decide on a regular line-up he can count on. </p>

<p>With three games played, Madrid sit third in the LaLiga table with seven points, elevel with Getafe, Valencia and Villarreal at this early stage.</p>

<p>However, bitter rivals Barcelona have two games in hand over them after a delayed start to the season.  </p>
