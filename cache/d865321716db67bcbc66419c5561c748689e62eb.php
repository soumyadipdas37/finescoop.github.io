<p>Lost and found: Kyle Richards revealed that she finally caught sight of a ring that was stolen from her in a million-dollar heist of her home three years ago; seen on RHOBH</p>

<p>The picture in question appears to be Diane's post from July 2019 showing a pair of hands with immensely long black fingernails and several rings.</p>

<p>'YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE BLACK BUT IS THIS TOO MUCH? I TOOK THIS PHOTO OF A FORTUNE TELLER IN SANTA MONICA,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Kyle and her realtor husband Mauricio Umansky were holidaying in Aspen when about $1million worth of belongings were swiped from their Encino, California mansion.</p>

<p>They were joined by four daughters Farrah, Portia, Alexia and Sophia, to whom Kyle had wanted to bequeath a lot of her jewelry.</p>

<p>Legend: The 51-year-old shared that she saw the jewelry on Diane Keaton's (pictured) Instagram page when The Godfather star posted a picture of a psychic's hands</p>

<p>She explained on the new Real Housewives special, according to TooFab: 'I was looking on Instagram and I saw Diane Keaton - she posted a picture of a psychic's hands on the Third Street Promenade and they had my ring on her hand.' </p>

<p>Kyle turned to her realtor husband Umansky's company for help, sharing that 'we reached out to one of our agents at The Agency who happens to represent Diane Keaton and I said: "You need to find out what the situation is."'</p>

<p>She reported: 'So Diane got back to her and she was a psychic on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica and that she just took a picture of her hands because she thought the nails were so interesting.' </p>

<p>After a failed attempt to locate the fortune-teller with a private investigator, Kyle teamed up with her co-star Teddi Jo Mellencamp-Arroyave to find her themselves.</p>

<p>Possible: The picture in question appears to be Diane's post from July 2019 showing a pair of hands with immensely long black fingernails and several rings</p>

<p>Teddi Jo became close friends with Kyle on the show, but she recently announced that Bravo have given her the ax.</p>

<p>On the special Teddi Jo described the psychic search, dishing: 'We thought we were hot on the trail but then we realized we were just being sent in circles.'</p>

<p>Although Kyle at that point was sidetracked with a film shoot and her Real Housewives schedule she is now interested to resume the hunt for her ring.</p>

<p>She announced, 'I want to know if she bought that from someone at a pawn shop, even if I have to buy it back from her, I'm happy to do that.'</p>

<p>The home robbery was so traumatic she considered moving out of the Encino property, she confessed to Bravo in 2018.</p>

<p>'There was one point after our house was burglarized that I thought, you know, I might have to sell my house - but then I look at my dogs and see how much they love this house and I think: "I could never leave,"' she explained.</p>

<p>Years ago she told People that in the burglary 'everything my mother, who passed away, had ever collected and saved to give to me - that I had always envisioned of passing on to my four daughters - was gone.'</p>

<p>Away: She was on vacation with her family when the robbery happened; seen with her real estate agent husband Mauricio Umansky</p>

<p>She added: 'Even my children’s baby bracelets. Obviously, those are the things that hurt the most, things that I can't replace. They're completely invaluable.'</p>

<p>In a different People interview she shared that despite being one of three sisters she inherited 'the majority' of her mother's keepsakes.</p>

<p>As a result, when these valuables were stolen 'there was guilt attached to it. They got taken from me, from my house, on my watch.'</p>
