<p>There had been suggestions new arrival Thiago Silva would take over the armband following the veteran Brazilian's move from Paris Saint-Germain.</p>

<p>But Lampard has kept the Spanish full-back in the role even if Reece James could play at right-back in the majority of games this season.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard has confirmed Cesar Azpilicueta will remain as Chelsea's captain this season</p>

<p>The Spanish right-back (left) will compete for his place with Reece James this season</p>

<p>Azpilicueta, 31, has been struggling with a hamstring injury and only played five minutes off the bench in Chelsea's Premier League opener at Brighton on Monday.</p>

<p>However, his influence off the field isn't in question and Lampard is only too happy to keep him in the role.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of Chelsea's meeting with Liverpool on Sunday, he said: 'Yes, absolutely Azpi is club captain this season, he's done a great job of it.</p>

<p>'Since I've been in the role, he's been a huge help to me, how's he's handled himself on and off the pitch, how much he feels for the club, how much he communicates within the squad.</p>

<p>'We can all see the quality of Reece James and the competition I have in that right-back position, but Azpi's professionalism means he's going to be as important for us this year as he always is. He is officially club captain.</p>

<p>Lampard praised Azpilicueta's professionalism and influence off the field at Chelsea</p>

<p>Reece James started Chelsea's win over Brighton and scored an excellent long-range goal</p>

<p>'I can't ask players who are as competitive as Azpi to be content with missing one game. Every player here should be keen to play every game.</p>

<p>'I know Azpi is like that. I know him from very well from playing with him.</p>

<p>'I don't expect saints who say, 'okay, I'm not playing this game, everything's fine and rosy'.</p>

<p>'Players need to want to play but, when you have someone like Azpi with the qualities he has as captain, I know he gives everything.</p>

<p>'I know that whether he plays or there might be times when he doesn't he will have the same positive impact on the group off the pitch.</p>

<p>'That's all I can ask for, and it's a pleasure to have him here for that.'</p>
