<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United fans have mocked leaked images of their third-kit for the 2020-21 season.</p>

<p>The leaked pictures appear to show that a black and white striped design will be run across the entire strip - including shorts and socks.</p>

<p>Dubbed as the 'zebra design', fans of the club on social media have ridiculed the kit which also has a stencil-style club badge with red Adidas logo and iconic stripes over the shoulders.</p>

<p>Images have been leaked of Manchester United's third kit for the upcoming domestic season</p>

<p>Manchester United fans have ridiculed the leaked images comparing it to a 'zebra crossing'</p>

<p>The images show the third kit as striped from top to bottom on the shirt, shorts and socks</p>

<p>FootyHeadlines.com who leaked the images posted on their website: 'More pictures of the Manchester United 20-21 third kit have been leaked, revealing that the eye-catching pattern continues onto the shorts and socks.'</p>

<p>Twitter user MGTweetz said 'Strikers gotta look both ways before they cross your defence. Cus it do be looking like a zebra crossing.'</p>

<p>Ashwin Sapre replied: 'We got a zebra crossing kit cuz teams are gonna walk all over us'.</p>

<p>Many fans tweeted zebra related responses to the leaked images which would certainly make United stand out next season when they wear the kit.</p>

<p>PavleUtd tweeted: 'It looks like we're trying to hypnotise the opposition' while Kamil Kowalski added that the Red Devils will look 'stupid playing in pyjamas.' </p>

<p>Ryan Wedderburn gave a brutal response to the kit saying that the kit 'has to be up there as one of the worst kits ever released.' </p>

<p>The shirt retains US car giant Chevrolet as its principle sponsor, with the partnership due to run out in 2021, while American manufacturer Kohler again have sleeve sponsorship rights.</p>

<p>One of the things which stood out most to people in their response of the kit were the 'zebra' themed shorts. </p>

<p>Twitter user Wassem said: 'I laughed for a good 15 minutes after looking at those shorts and realising how ridiculous players will look wearing. <?php echo e('@'); ?>adidasfootball y'all still have time cancel this abomination.'  </p>
