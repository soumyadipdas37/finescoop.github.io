<p>Grant Hodnett, 38, began a campaign of stalking after he discovered his girlfriend was secretly an adult model, a court heard.</p>

<p>Warrington Magistrates' Court heard how he sent 20 erotic photos of his ex-girlfriend to her father stating that she was 'at risk and needed help'.</p>

<p>The former Gloucestershire batsman also sent derogatory messages and branded his ex a 'liar and a psychopath' to family, friends, employers and customers.</p>

<p>The court heard how the pair were embroiled in an argument after he learned about her adult modelling career which ended their relationship.</p>

<p>Former Gloucestershire batsman Grant Hodnett, 38, began a campaign of stalking after he discovered his girlfriend was secretly an adult model, Warrington Magistrates' Court heard</p>

<p>He sent 20 erotic photos of his ex-girlfriend to her father stating that she was 'at risk and needed help', and also sent derogatory messages to her friends and employers</p>

<p>Prosecutor Lucy Fitch-Adams told the court how the complainant was called into the office of the charity shop where she worked after Hodnett sent them a brown envelope.</p>

<p>The South Africa-born sportsman 'came perilously close to custody' but avoided jail because of his previous good character</p>

<p>In it were pictures of her, a letter talking about her personal life and the sites she had done adult modelling on.</p>

<p>Ms Fitch-Adams said the complainant now feels 'scared' as the Hodnett's 'persistent and unwanted behaviour' continued to escalate.</p>

<p>Reading from a victim impact statement, Ms Fitch-Adams said: 'The complainant is scared about what will happen next as the defendant's behaviour was escalating further and further.</p>

<p>'The defendant is aware she is a recovering alcoholic and signing her email up for sites has caused a decline in her mental health.</p>

<p>'She believes the defendant is trying to make her have a breakdown and wants his persistent and unwanted behaviour to stop, as it is making her life a misery.'</p>

<p>Hodnett, of Warrington, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to the charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress.</p>

<p>But the South Africa-born sportsman was saved by his 'previous good character' and a large collection of positive references.</p>

<p>The court heard that Hodnett has no previous convictions but did receive a caution in June 2015 for harassment.</p>

<p>In defence of his client, Mark Haslam pointed to a vast collection of character references which portray Hodnett as a man of good character, and determined the root of his behaviour to be the breakdown of their relationship.</p>

<p>Hodnett, of Warrington, Lancashire, pleaded guilty to the charge of stalking involving serious alarm or distress and was sentenced to 24 weeks in prison suspended for two years and ordered to complete a two-year community order</p>

<p>He said: 'The defendant accepts that his conduct was not just inappropriate, but totally unacceptable. It was not for him to go on a moral crusade.</p>

<p>'A number of people have written on behalf of the defendant and we had to draw the line at 25.</p>

<p>'The activities of the complainant came to the attention of the defendant, and this caused him to have a total breakdown as he felt betrayed.</p>

<p>'He spent three days in custody after his arrest, which was ample time for him to consider his behaviour.'</p>

<p>Mr Haslam also pointed out that the situation was not a 'one-way street', and said that in July, the complainant made contact with the defendant to 'discuss the possibility of a reconciling their relationship'.</p>

<p>He added: 'Since his first appearance in court, the defendant has been the target of material sent to parties he is connected with - his cricket club, who have said they will stand by him, and the gym that he works, who have said they will stand by him.</p>

<p>'He does not wish to report this to the police as wants to move forward with life.'</p>

<p>Before sentencing, chair magistrate Alan Davies said to Hodnett: 'You came perilously close to custody, but your previous good character has stopped you.</p>

<p>'If you come before this court in the next two years for any reason, take something with you, as you will be going to custody.'</p>

<p>Hodnett was sentenced to 24 weeks in prison suspended for two years and ordered to complete a two-year community order.</p>

<p>He will have to attend a building better relationships course, 20 rehabilitation activity requirement days and 150 hours of unpaid work.</p>

<p>The court also approved a restraining order preventing Hodnett from contacting the defendant and ordered him to pay £335 in court costs</p>
