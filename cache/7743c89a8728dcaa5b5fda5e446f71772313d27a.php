<p>So sweet: Hilaria Baldwin posted a nostalgic Insta Stories snap of her burgeoning bump way back in January near the beginning of her pregnancy</p>

<p>She posted a snap of herself taken on January 20 when she was barely visibly pregnant and 'hid it with high waisted pants.'</p>

<p>Her other way of concealing the bump was 'Leo hugs,' she wrote over a snap of herself lovingly holding her three-year-old son Leo against her front.</p>

<p>Alec and Hilaria are already the proud parents of a daughter called Carmen, six, and three sons - Rafael, five, Leonardo, three, and Romeo, two.</p>

<p>The soon-to-be mother-of-five recently posted an Insta Stories message revealing that 'Apparently it's my turn' to contemplate a certain talk with her eldest.</p>

<p>'Jan 20, 2020': The 36-year-old, who is expecting her fifth child by her 62-year-old husband Alec Baldwin, also revealed how she kept her bump a secret in those days</p>

<p>'Carmen is telling me her current idea on how a baby is made…I still am trying to figure out how I am supposed to properly explain it to her,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Last week she shared that she was 'WIPED' after mistakenly assuming she was in labor and embarking on an hours-long 'ROAD-TRIP' to the doctor.</p>

<p>'I’VE HAD A MILLION KIDS DROVE 3 HOURS TO THE DR TODAY BECAUSE I THOUGHT MAYBE I WAS IN LABOR,' Hilaria wrote.</p>

<p>'YOU’D THINK I WOULD KNOW BY NOW BUT WITH LIVING SO FAR FROM THE HOSPITAL DUE TO COVID, I’M TRYING TO ANTICIPATE LABOR EVEN SOONER. LITERALLY WAS THERE FOR 10 MIN AND HAD TO DRIVE 3 HOURS BACK HOME BECAUSE I WAS NOT IN LABOR,' she spilled.</p>

<p>Baby mine: Her other way of concealing the bump was 'Leo hugs,' she wrote over a snap of herself lovingly holding her three-year-old son Leo against her front</p>

<p>Hilaria revealed in April that she is pregnant with her fifth child after suffering two miscarriages last year, most recently in November.</p>

<p>'We are really excited. We just passed the mark of when we lost the last baby,' Hilaria told Renee Bargh of Extra in May. </p>

<p>'I am usually somebody that I share really early on. This time, because it happened so soon after the last one, I had to collect my thoughts… I was feeling the ups and downs of my emotions from what had just happened,' she revealed.</p>

<p>'Then, all a sudden, the coronavirus [happened], and I wanted to be respectful not to turn the conversation to myself, so I was waiting and waiting.'</p>

<p>Dear, oh, dear: The soon-to-be mother-of-five recently posted an Insta Stories message revealing that 'Apparently it's my turn' to contemplate a certain talk with her eldest</p>

<p>Conundrum: 'Carmen is telling me her current idea on how a baby is made…I still am trying to figure out how I am supposed to properly explain it to her,' she wrote</p>

<p>Hilaria has not gone public with the sex of the baby but announced during her Extra interview: 'We’re expecting sometime in September.' </p>

<p>In addition to his soon-to-be five children with Hilaria, Alec shares a 24-year-old daughter called Ireland with his first wife Kim Basinger.</p>

<p>Alec threw Hilaria a surprise baby shower this week with the members of their coronavirus 'quarantine bubble,' she revealed on Insta Stories. </p>

<p>The party featured David Nugent, artistic director of the Hamptons International Film Festival, and his wife Violet Gaynor, who co-founded the style website The Glow. </p>

<p>Misunderstanding: Last week she shared that she was 'WIPED' after mistakenly assuming she was in labor and embarking on an hours-long 'ROAD-TRIP' to the doctor</p>
