<p>The man who took Haku has repeatedly insisted he did not steal the dog, but thought she had been left with him permanently. </p>

<p>However Missing &amp; Stolen Pets page administrators wrote on Friday that they had copies of all conversations between the 'persons of interest' and the legal owners as well as a copy of the police report.</p>

<p>'Hand Haku into a vet, pound or police. Keeping an animal that is legally not yours is deemed under Australian law "theft of property",' they wrote, all in capital letters.   </p>
