<p>The TV presenter's daughter, 20, who has a compromised immune system and an underlying cardiac condition, has begun her second year of university amid the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Speaking on Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain, Ulrika, 53, said: 'At the beginning of Lockdown, Bo was terrified and went into lockdown a week before the nation went into lockdown.</p>

<p>Health: Ulrika Jonsson, 53, has admitted her daughter Bo, 20, was 'terrified' before Britain went into lockdown and is taking risks by going to university</p>

<p>'As time went by I became increasingly concerned about her mental health because she was basically locked up in her room. She had contact with her friends on FaceTime but that social thing they thrive on became a concern for me.'</p>

<p>The Swedish star explained that Bo is now doing a combination of in-person lectures and virtual work at university and feels more confident than she did at the beginning of lockdown.</p>

<p>She said: 'After three months, she decided when she was allowed, to bubble with another family and her present situation is that the college is doing a mix of lectures and virtual. </p>

<p>'She also does a lot of placements and those are constantly under review. I think Bo’s approach now is, strangely, a lot more relaxed than she was initially. She feels like she’s had a taste of normal life and is having to take some risks.'</p>

<p>Ulrika also gave her thoughts on Sweden's response to the coronavirus, who unlike the UK and many other countries, never had a full-scale lockdown.  </p>

<p>She said: 'Being Swedish, the Swedes have not had anything imposed on them. They’ve been asked to do things and as they’re community minded, they tend to do what they’re told. </p>

<p>'They’ve kept the country going and there are no real massive impositions. My nephew has been in school throughout, my sister has stayed working. I think they feel proud of the way their government has dealt with the situation.'   </p>

<p>It comes after Ulrika admitted earlier this month that she 'sobbed every night' when her son Cameron first went to university. </p>

<p>Ulrika said: 'I think Bo’s approach now is strangely, a lot more relaxed than she was initially. She feels like she’s had a taste of normal life and is having to take some risks'</p>

<p>Sharing snaps of her 25-year-old, who she shares with ex-husband John Turnbull, she reflected on when he left home seven years earlier, and the TV presenter said she was 'not good at letting go'. </p>

<p>She wrote: 'For all those parents going through the same right now: it does eventually get better. And then they come home penniless, hungover and qualified as plonkers (and in Goldenballs’ case, Film Director).</p>

<p>'But the changing shape of the family isn’t always an easy transition. 2 out of 4 of mine are gone.' </p>

<p>She went on: 'Now my youngest wonders why I cling on to him for dear life when he walks to school every morning, dragging me along the ground, behind him....'</p>

<p>Looking back: It comes after Ulrika admitted earlier this month that she 'sobbed every night' when her son Cameron, 25, first went to university</p>

<p>'I’m just not good at letting go of things I thought I owned but are apparently just on loan, ‘s all (sic).'</p>

<p>Her post comes after she praised her 'brilliant' daughter Martha for passing her GCSEs last month, after the government's U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimated grades following the cancellation of exams amid the pandemic.</p>

<p>The TV star shares Bo with hotel manager Marcus Kempen, and Malcolm, 12, with advertising executive Brian Monet.</p>
