<p>Hoffman told the outlet that she was catching up on Brian's inaugural Instagram Live show from August 29, which ran for almost 40 minutes.</p>

<p>In the final few minutes, the actor updated his fans on the schooling situation for his four children while also saluting teachers who were skilled enough to 'trick' uninterested youngsters into learning. </p>
