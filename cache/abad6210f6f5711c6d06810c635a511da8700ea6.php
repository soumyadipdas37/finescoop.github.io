<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A couple had their brand new garden bed destroyed by thieves just a month after moving into a trendy suburb - only for a heartwarming gesture to lift their spirits.</p>

<p>The pair discovered a number of plants had been ripped out and stolen from the front of their home in Surry Hills, in Sydney, on Monday. </p>

<p>But their disappointment was short-lived thanks to a random act of kindness from a total stranger. </p>

<p>The pair discovered a number of plants had been ripped out and stolen from the front of their home in Surry Hills, in Sydney, on Monday </p>

<p>The pair wrote about the brazen theft in a post in a neighbourhood Facebook group. </p>

<p>While many jumped to defend the local community, one man took it into his own hands to fix the issue himself.</p>

<p>'I just stopped on my way home from the gym... and bought you these,' Mike Galvin - who runs the Facebook page - wrote.</p>

<p>His post was accompanied by a photo of him holding three plants to replace the ones which had been ripped out of his neighbour's garden. </p>

<p>Mr Galvin said the whole point of the page was to bring community members together. </p>

<p>Michael Galvin (pictured) bought new plants to help cheer up the pair</p>

<p>'The inspiration for starting the group was a lady called Natalie Wood who had died in Surry Hills and she was in her apartment for eight years before she was found,' Mr Galvin told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'It's just sort of connecting neighbours and making sure loneliness and isolation can be avoided at all costs.' </p>

<p>He said the theft didn't reflect the community and he wanted to make the new residents feel welcome.  </p>

<p>'These things happen so often and it's nice to be able to jump in to help,' he said. </p>

<p>'I guess that's what we foster through the Facebook group is just bringing people together and helping instead of focusing on the negatives.</p>

<p>'There is a genuine sense of community in postcode 2010 that has been fostered over the Darlo Darlings Facebook page that is translating into face to face contact.'</p>

<p>The couple have already planted the new additions to their garden, after picking up the new gifts from Mark the Florist in Darlinghurst. They even sent photos of their new garden bed (pictured) to the man who made their dream a reality</p>

<p>He said since the coronavirus pandemic it has become more important than ever to make an effort to support the local community. </p>

<p>'We've built such a strong community. People have really united during COVID-19. So when things do go wrong I think people look out for one another,' he said.    </p>
