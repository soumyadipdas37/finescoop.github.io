<p>Jetting off: Kim Zolciak was spotted arriving to LAX with husband Kroy Biermann and daughter Brielle, 23, on Thursday afternoon in Los Angeles</p>

<p>Zolciak had her signature bleach blonde hair styled in loose waves that flowed down to her waist.</p>

<p>She perfectly meshed style and comfort by slipping her refined curves into a black form-fitting sweat set that included a cropped hoodie and a pair of leggings.</p>

<p>Kim, like the rest of her family, adhered to California's mask mandate by properly covering her mouth and nose with a reusable mask.</p>

<p>Brielle bared her toned midriff in a black sports bra and matching leggings.</p>

<p>She gave her ensemble an edgy vibe by rocking a pair of platform Dr. Marten boots and an oversized Nirvana band tee, which she threw on while walking through the airport.</p>

<p>Brielle's hair, like her mother's, parted her brunette tresses down the middle and sported a noticeable body wave.</p>

<p>Kroy, a former player for the Atlanta Falcons, had his arm wrapped tenderly around his wife of nine-years Kim, while donning a grey long sleeve tee and a pair of white sweat shorts. </p>

<p>He kept his blonde hair concealed beneath a baseball cap and he wore a black cloth face mask. </p>

<p>The reality TV family looked beyond content as they made their way through the airport terminal together with their luggage in hand. </p>
