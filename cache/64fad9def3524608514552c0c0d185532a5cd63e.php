<p>A pulsing signal was detected on Thursday from under the rubble of a building that collapsed during the horrific port explosion. </p>

<p>Rescuers are searching through the rubble of a building in Beirut after reports that a heartbeat was detected</p>

<p>A sniffer dog belonging to the Chilean search and rescue team first detected something as the team was going through a street in one of the worst hit areas.   </p>

<p>The team then used audio detection equipment for signals or heartbeat, and detected what could be a pulse of 18 to 19 beats per minute. </p>

<p>The origin of the pulsing signal was not immediately known but it set off a frantic search and raised new hope. </p>

<p>It is extremely unlikely that any survivors would be found a month after the blast but a Chilean volunteer, said their equipment detected a sign of a human. </p>

<p> A sniffer dog belonging to the Chilean search and rescue team first detected something as the team was going through a street in one of the worst hit areas</p>

<p>The worker who identified himself as Francesco Lermonda said it is rare, but not unheard of, for someone to survive under the rubble for a month. </p>

<p>As night fell, rescue workers set up light projectors to work through the darkness. </p>

<p>Every now and then, the team asked people on the streets to stay quiet for five minutes so as not to interfere with the sounds being detected by their instruments.</p>

<p>There were 2,750 tonnes of the hazardous chemical held in the warehouse at the time of the explosion - which measured as the equivalent of a 3.5 earthquake. </p>

<p>The explosion in a port warehouse killed 191 people and injured 6,000 others in the Lebanese capital on August 4. </p>

<p>Lebanon's president and prime minister were warned last month that a stash of ammonium nitrate at the port of Beirut could destroy the city if it exploded.</p>

<p>Security officials wrote a letter on July 20 saying the industrial chemicals which had been idling in a warehouse since 2013 needed to be secured immediately.     </p>

<p>Thousands of protesters continue to take to the streets and clash with police and the prime minister and his cabinet resigned after the devastating explosion.        </p>

<p>Every now and then, the team asked people on the streets to stay quiet for five minutes so as not to interfere with the sounds being detected by their instruments</p>

<p>Fires were still burning at the destroyed port following the blast  as the full extent of the devastation - in a country that was already in the midst of an economic crisis - was laid bare</p>
