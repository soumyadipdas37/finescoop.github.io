<p>Canberra woman Jay Gill went on an online and real-life rampage of harassment against with her partner's ex, sharing pictures of her online before chasing her around a supermarket.</p>

<p>Gill distributed 'revenge porn' pictures of the woman, who cannot be named, through Facebook Messenger to at least 80 people in November 2017.</p>

<p>Canberra woman Jay Gill went on a rampage with her partner's ex-girlfriend, sharing nude pictures of her online before chasing her around a supermarket</p>

<p>The woman had sent the 'tit pic' to her former partner while they were together thinking no one else would see it, Canberra Star reports.</p>

<p>When Gill sent the photo to other people she also sent a message saying the woman was a 'fat wh**e with her ugly nipple hanging out'.</p>

<p>Friends who saw the photo contacted the victim, including her butcher who asked if the woman knew there was a 'nude pic of you doing the rounds'.  </p>

<p>The victim told a hearing earlier this month that she was so horrified her butcher had seen the photos that she has not returned to his business since. </p>

<p>A stranger also messaged the woman saying: 'Hey I don’t even know you, but thought you might like to know Jay Kingsley is sending nude pictures of your tits to me! No idea why!'</p>

<p>Chief Magistrate Lorainne Walker said Gill then continued to post a 'running commentary of irrational vitriol' about the woman that turned into a 'public scandal'.</p>

<p>The woman sued for defamation and argued both the image and messages had damaged her reputation as it portrayed her as a 'wh**e and sl*t'.</p>

<p>Gill distributed nude 'revenge porn' pictures of the woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through Facebook Messenger to at least 80 people in November 2017</p>

<p>Ms Walker agreed that the online posts had portrayed the victim as 'a fat whore, a slut, neglectful of her children, an unfit mother and a person who bore children by different men in order to exploit the welfare system'.  </p>

<p>Gill attempted to fight the defamation and argued sharing the image was 'trivial' and was unlikely to cause the woman harm as her comments were 'honest opinion'.</p>

<p>She was briefly jailed in 2019 for threatening to kill the woman after continuously threatening her in public.</p>

<p>In one instance, Gill chased the woman and one of her four children around a supermarket yelling: 'fat wh**e, I'm gonna kill you'.</p>

<p>The woman said the treatment by Gill and the photo being made public had made her anxious, withdrawn and paranoid.</p>

<p>She had trouble sleeping and had also been prescribed medication for her anxiety.</p>

<p>Magistrate Walker said Gill's harassment was 'inherently quite vile' and awarded the victim $54,000 for defamation that Gill will have to payout.  </p>
