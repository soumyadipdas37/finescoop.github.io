<p>His Sunrise colleagues joked that his girlfriend didn't exist, and he proved that they were in fact together by sharing a photo of the couple on Instagram.</p>

<p>Sam has not alluded to a break-up on social media, but tellingly the pair haven't been pictured together since April 20.</p>

<p>That same month, the popular TV host told the Fitzy &amp; Wippa radio show that he was enjoying spending time with Elle in lockdown. </p>

<p>'There is definitely a positive to it [staying at home]. I mean, I've got a new girlfriend now so I've got time to actually spend with her,' he said.</p>

<p>Whispers: The pair are said to have called it quits last month after dating for less than a year</p>

<p>'We've only been official since just before isolation. I got her at the pre-isolation sale! I got her just before it all happened.'</p>

<p>Radio host Sarah McGilvray noted that it was 'pretty intense' for the couple to shack up in lockdown, considering they hadn't been together for that long. </p>

<p>'Yeah, it is a bit intense, but so far so good,' he replied.</p>

<p>Big news! He reluctantly announced his romance with Elle on Sunrise in March, when he brought her up during a weather report. His colleagues joked that his girlfriend didn't exist, and he proved that they were in fact together by sharing a photo of the couple on Instagram</p>

<p>Elle has a nine-to-five job as a communications adviser for Qantas, but Sam is often travelling around the country working unsociable hours. </p>

<p>The 38-year-old, whose real name is Sam McMillan, previously told New Idea: 'A lot of why I'm single is because of my dedication to my work.</p>

<p>'Particularly with this role, the travel means I'm probably only home a couple of days a week.</p>

<p>'It's the sort of role that it's not good to look too far ahead because it is too overwhelming. If I looked at the next two months of my schedule I would be freaking out.'</p>

<p>Dream job: Born in Adelaide, Sam worked in radio and for Channel 10's The Project before replacing Edwina Bartholomew as Sunrise's roving weather presenter in early 2016</p>
