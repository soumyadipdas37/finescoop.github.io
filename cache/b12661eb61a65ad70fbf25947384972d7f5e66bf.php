<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford are reportedly concerned they could lose their presenting jobs on This Morning as ITV tries to diversify its shows.</p>

<p>The couple, who present the show on Fridays and to cover Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby's holidays, are said to be awaiting the results of an internal poll to hear about their fate, reports The Sun.</p>

<p>A source has said: 'Eamonn fears he is basically too "pale, stale and male", and, at 60, perhaps not in line with the youth drive broadcasters are after.'</p>

<p>Worried? Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford are reportedly concerned they could lose their presenting jobs on This Morning as ITV tries to diversify its shows</p>

<p>They added that nobody at the show wanted to see the very 'popular' duo leave but there was tough decisions ahead.    </p>

<p>'The shows execs have some very tricky decisions. One possibility is to keep the couple on as regular holiday cover but lose their regular Friday slot. </p>

<p>'Nothing's been decided yet, and much rests on this internal poll,' they added.  </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Eamonn and Ruth to ask for a comment. </p>

<p>Regulars: The duo currently present This Morning on Fridays and as holiday cover for the usual weekday hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby</p>

<p>Although nothing has been confirmed, Rochelle Humes, 31, is thought to be a possible replacement as she's already worked on This Morning to cover Holly.</p>

<p>Another name said to be in the running if the duo are axed from the show is former Strictly winner and fellow presenter Ore Oduba.</p>

<p>It comes just two months after ITV announced its Diversity Acceleration Plan to try and increase inclusion on screen.</p>

<p>Potential replacement? Rochelle Humes is thought to have been mentioned as someone who could take over the shows (pictured working on This Morning in August with Dermot O'Leary)</p>

<p>In the running? Ore Oduba has also been hinted at being a potential replacement for Eamonn and Ruth (pictured with his Strictly partner Karen Clifton in 2017)</p>

<p>The broadcaster explained how the plan aimed to: 'Accelerate change in diversity and inclusion on screen and across ITV by creating more opportunities for those from Black, Asian, minority ethnic and other underrepresented groups. </p>

<p>A statement added: 'Over the next 12 months ITV will increase investment in this area and this plan will deliver measurable change across all levels and parts of ITV.</p>

<p>'The first move is to create a new role of Group Diversity and Inclusion Director, which will sit on ITV’s Management Board and report to CEO Carolyn McCall.'     </p>

<p>And just earlier this week changes to the BBC's A Question Of Sport hit the headlines when host of 24 years Sue Barker was axed.</p>

<p>Tv stars: Phillip and Holly present the show during the weekdays with Eamonn and Ruth taking the reigns on Fridays and during holidays (pictured together in February)</p>

<p>Rumoured: Alex Scott was tipped to be the new host on the BBC's A Question Of Sport earlier this week but was later targeted with racial abuse by trolls (pictured during Strictly in 2019)</p>

<p>Changes: Sue, 64, has been axed from the BBC show, alongside team captains Matt Dawson (left) and Phil Tufnell (right) and Alex has been widely tipped to replace her</p>

<p>After the news broke, former footballer Alex Scott was suggested as a potential replacement and it was then reported that she had received racial abuse from trolls on her social media pages.</p>

<p>However a BBC Spokesperson told MailOnline her being a host hadn't been confirmed. They said: 'This is all speculation, and no conversations have been made about the future line-up.'  </p>

<p>However BBC Spokesperson told MailOnline: 'This is all speculation, and no conversations have been made about the future line-up.' </p>

<p>Despite this, Gary Lineker caused a furore when he wrote on Twitter on Thursday: 'Congratulations and good luck to <?php echo e('@'); ?>AlexScott on being the new host for Question Of Sport. </p>

<p>'Smart, knowledgeable and perfectly qualified for the role. Oh... and if you have a problem with Alex getting the job, you might just be part of the problem.'  </p>

<p>Congratulations and good luck: Gary was accused of 'race-baiting' after he prematurely confirmed the news on Twitter and called out anyone who had a problem with the decision </p>

<p>Alex is of Irish and Jamaican descent and the wording of Gary's tweet about her appointment also seemed to ire the masses when he was accused of 'race-baiting people for an argument'.</p>

<p>They wrote: 'Lineker is real race baiter - seems he loves to stir things - I like Alex Scott - but Lineker should just get on with his other job as housing Officer ( to anyone but British) #DefundTheBBC.'</p>

<p>'What a smug, arrogant man you are! What was the point of that last comment? no need! You’re just baiting people for an argument.</p>

<p>'If she’s the right person for the job then good for her, no need to bring colour into it. You're part of the problem!'   </p>

<p>Reaction: Twitter users quickly responded to Gary's tweet with some accusing him of 'race baiting'</p>
