<p>Several agencies dispatched to San Marcos River and conducted a search of the area where Austin, 29, of Fresno, disappeared until 10pm. </p>

<p>The search was paused for the night, but authorities returned around 7am on Sunday. </p>

<p>Authorities discovered Austin's body around 1pm by local divers.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Caldwell County Sheriff's Department told DailyMail.com that the spot where Austin was found is popular tubing site and others have drowned in that area.</p>

<p>Authorities said Austin was tubing with family when he fell out of his tube and did not resurface from the water for approximately 10 minutes</p>

<p>Authorities said the area where Austin was found on San Marcos River is a popular tubing spot among locals </p>

<p>They said around that area, the water begins to slow down and people may not realize that there's a large drop underneath the water. </p>

<p>The spokesperson added that water conditions on Saturday appeared normal. </p>

<p>David Lackey, who oversees the Northway Summer League Adult Basketball League, said Austin was a 'fine example of a young man raising a family.'</p>

<p>'I met Jesse as player and I entrusted him as someone I could use to lead a team. That requires a lot of responsibility,' he said.</p>

<p>'I had the privilege of being their devotional leader on many occasions as I normally do with the teams that are new. Now it can be hard to walk into a room of people that have just lost a basketball game and then spread the word of God. Jesse’s team always held this part with the highest amount of respect. </p>

<p>'He was a leader, and a follower of Christ. He had a beautiful family, he loved the Lakers, whom happens to be my favorite team, so we had a lot in common.'</p>

<p>Lackey: 'He was a leader, and a follower of Christ. He had a beautiful family, he loved the Lakers, whom happens to be my favorite team, so we had a lot in common'</p>

<p>Lackey added that Austin 'recruited several players, not necessarily from a basketball perspective, but to help those come to know Christ perspective. </p>

<p>'He always used manors, he was always respectful and was someone I could trust to lead a team.'</p>

<p>On Facebook, people who knew Austin shared condolences as they mourned the loss of a father and beloved friend.</p>

<p>'I can’t even believe this,' one person wrote. 'Absolutely devastating. I’m so sorry to his family &amp; those who loved Jessie. A truly great person, gone too soon'</p>

<p>Another person wrote:  'Still can't believe this is real. I just saw you Friday night. My entire Austin fam is hurting right now. I'm glad we got us, but more importantly TMH got us.' </p>
