<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Classic car experts have tracked down the legendary Aston Martin Bulldog and are in the process of restoring it to its former glory, it has been revealed.</p>

<p>The Aston Martin Bulldog was a one-off supercar concept produced in 1979 in an effort to show off the capabilities of the company's new engineering facility in Milton Keynes.</p>

<p>Initially a production run of 15 to 25 cars was planned but the project was deemed too expensive and only one was ever built. </p>

<p>The car, designed by William Towns, was produced in 1979 and was the only one ever built</p>

<p>The car once reached speeds of 192mph but Top Gear experts estimate it could reach 237mph</p>

<p>Now the son of former Aston Martin boss Victor Gauntlett has tracked down the vehicle and is heading up a project to restore it.</p>

<p>Speaking to the BBC, Richard Gauntlett described the car as a 'mythical creature' and said no one has seen it run in at least 30 years.</p>

<p>He added: 'There's a great deal of personal meaning to this because I was obsessed with the car as a child.'</p>

<p>The car was located in the Far East and was bought by an American Bulldog fan before it was transported to Shropshire where it will be restored by a team of experts headed by Richard. </p>

<p>The car was traced to the Far East and has been bought by an American fan for restoration</p>

<p>The car's futuristic design with gullwing doors and wedge shaped body was popular with fans</p>

<p>Experts estimate the restoration project, in Shropshire, will take up to a year to be completed</p>

<p>The two-door coupe style car broke records when it reached 192mph in 1980 with its sleek futuristic design and Aston Martin 5.3-litre V8 engine but Top Gear experts estimate it was capable of going as fast as 237mph.</p>

<p>The vehicle itself was was 15ft 6in long and just 43in tall, with a pair of electro-hydraulically operated gullwing doors.</p>

<p>Inside, the supercar's interior was upholstered in leather and used multiple LED buttons.  </p>

<p>In 1981, when Victor Gauntlett became chairman of Aston Martin, he decided the project would be too costly, and the project was shelved. </p>

<p>In 1984, the Bulldog was sold to a middle eastern collector for £130,000 before reportedly spending time in the United States.</p>

<p>Experts estimate the project will take about a year to complete. </p>
