<p>Dramatic video shows FDNY firefighters rescuing a woman who had climbed onto the ledge of her 16th floor apartment to escape a blaze tearing through her home</p>

<p>One firefighter, Brian Quinn, scaled the side of the building from above and stood behind the woman to ensure that she wouldn't fall or jump</p>

<p>The fire had broken out inside the woman's apartment and she fled onto the thin ledge to escape. </p>

<p>As one group of firefighters secured the rope on the floor above to pull the woman to safety, another was in the apartment working to extinguish the flames.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Firefighter Quinn scaled the building from above and stood behind the woman to make sure she wouldn't fall. </p>

<p>He said one of his lieutenants was trying to coax her inside, but she wouldn't budge. </p>

<p>'She was completely panicked and she was not going to let go,' Quinn said.  </p>

<p>'I was right behind her, so if she did decide to jump or let go I was holding her to the glass. </p>

<p>'I just said: "I'm not going to let you fall. We're going to get you inside."</p>

<p>He said the smoke finally began to disperse after firefighters broke the windows to the apartment - alleviating some of the woman's fear about going back in. </p>

<p>FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said the crew's 'aggressive attack' managed to tame the fire enough to bring the woman into the apartment instead of going through with the rope maneuver. </p>

<p>The fire was contained within about 30 minutes. </p>

<p>FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro (pictured) praised the crew's 'aggressive attack'</p>

<p>Quinn noted that he and his crew had practiced the same drill just two hours before they responded to the Lenox Ave fire. </p>

<p>'We train all the time. That's our job,' he said.      </p>

<p>'This was really a heroic rescue and shows the talent and bravery of the members of the FDNY, something that is rarely done,' Nigro said in the Instagram post. </p>

<p>'They used their skills quickly, assessed the situation quickly, did what had to be done, bravely. </p>

<p>'Thanks to their bravery, effort and ingenuity, we have someone who was saved here on Lenox Avenue. It's a happy day for her and a happy day for all of us.'</p>

<p>Nigro said the woman, who has not been identified, was treated for smoke inhalation. </p>
