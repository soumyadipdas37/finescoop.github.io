<p>The daughter of Goldie Hawn had her golden hair tied up into a messy bun and she had on a face mask meant to resemble a cat's nose and whiskers.</p>

<p>She rocked a pair of suede booties and she had a brown leather bag slung over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Hudson had numerous large shopping bags resting in the crook of her arm, including a hefty bag from the designer store Anine Bing.</p>

<p>She, eventually, located her white Tesla in the mall's vast parking lot, slid into the driver's seat, and took off.</p>

<p>Kate and Danny, who first began dating in 2017, share one-year-old daughter Rani Rose.</p>

<p>The Fool's Gold star also has a 16-year-old son Ryder with ex Chris Robinson, 53, and an eight-year-old son Bingham with ex Matt Bellamy, 42.</p>

<p>Kate has successfully juggled a hugely consistent Hollywood career, while raising her three children.</p>

<p>And she recently appeared on Naomi Campbell's podcast No Filter to discuss the demands of her job and the harsh environment actresses are subjected to in Hollywood.</p>

<p>'The reality is I have three kids I love, I’ve got a lot of work and I love making movies. Nothing will ever keep me away from making movies,' admitted Kate to the 50-year-old supermodel.</p>

<p>'The issue with movie making is that it takes you away, and it’s really really sh***y hours, and when you’re doing it it’s like "I better really really like this story. I better love the people I’m working with. I better love this director," or it really is like why am I here?'  </p>

<p>She went on to suggest that, although she loves the movie business, there is a clear gender bias against actresses, which it makes it harder for them to forge their way.  </p>

<p>'One thing in Hollywood – women don’t get the same opportunities, and what I mean by that is one failure is like an equivalent to three failures for a guy.</p>

<p>'One female box office not great opening for a woman… the next time they’re thinking of casting you for something they’ll be like, "her last movie didn’t do great."</p>

<p>'For a guy, they usually give them about three to five chances, right? And they’ll still get paid, and they’ll still get the opportunity but for some reason with women it’s a little bit different.'</p>

<p>'The other thing is that when women get really famous, they don't really want the famous person in the movie, they want a new face, whereas for a guy it's totally different. I think it’s just a bad antiquated habit,' explained Kate. </p>
