<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea mounted a superb second-half comeback to force a share of the spoils with West Brom despite trailing by three goals at the break.</p>

<p>Callum Robinson struck twice to stun the new-look visitors, and Kyle Bartley finished with aplomb at the far post to plunge Chelsea ever closer to a shock defeat at the Hawthorns.</p>

<p>But it was Frank Lampard's homegrown heroes who helped the Blues emerge with a hard-fought point, with Mason Mount, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham all on target. </p>

<p>NICK CALLOW has given his verdict on each player's performance from the thriller in the Midlands.</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham netted a late equaliser as Chelsea fought back to take a point at West Brom</p>

<p>Callum Robinson's brace saw the hosts take a shock three-goal lead into the half-time break</p>

<p>West Brom (5-4-1)</p>

<p>Sam Johnstone - 6</p>

<p>Safe handling whenever called upon and that helped raise confidence levels in face of near-constant Chelsea possession. Couple of good saves from Havertz.</p>

<p>Darnell Furlong - 7</p>

<p>The son of former Chelsea striker Paul was dangerous going forward and delivered a great headed flick to assist Bartley's goal.</p>

<p>Semi Ajayi - 7</p>

<p>So solid in defence and his burst of pace past Alonso drew a booking for the Chelsea defender, who did not make it past half-time before being subbed.</p>

<p>Kyle Bartley - 7</p>

<p>Reliable at the back, the former Arsenal and Swansea defender took his goal like a seasoned striker.</p>

<p>Defender Kyle Bartley took his goal - West Brom's third of the evening - like a seasoned striker</p>

<p>Dara O'Shea - 6</p>

<p>The aspiring Republic of Ireland international does not look out of place at this level and hardly put a foot wrong.</p>

<p>Conor Townsend - 5</p>

<p>Beaten too many times on his side of defence as he wasted a chance to impress as a replacement for suspended left back Kieran Gibbs.</p>

<p>Matheus Pereira - 6</p>

<p>Busy and involved from the start, helping to set the tone and settle his team-mates. A great asset going forward.</p>

<p>Jake Livermore - 7</p>

<p>The Albion captain showed his Premier League experience with a sure-footed display and why he helped steer the club to promotion last season</p>

<p>Romaine Sawyers - 7</p>

<p>Not remotely intimidated by Havertz and co. with arguably the most important midfield display of the night.</p>

<p>Romaine Sawyers was not intimated by Chelsea's star-studded attack in a superb showing</p>

<p>Grady Diangana - 6</p>

<p>Looked lively and nearly got West Brom's fourth only for his finishing to let him down.</p>

<p>Callum Robinson - 8 </p>

<p>A brilliantly taken first goal was only his second in the Premier League. Scored his second on the night with equal assurance. Ability to score many more.</p>

<p>Robinson had netted twice and proved he possesses the ability to score more in the top flight</p>

<p>Subs: Robson-Kanu (replaced Robinson after 66 minutes) 6</p>

<p>Phillips (replaced Diangana 74 mins)</p>

<p>Field (replaced Pereira 90 mins)</p>

<p>Subs not used: Button, Harper, Edwards, Kipre</p>

<p>Chelsea (4-2-3-1)</p>

<p>Willy Caballero - 5</p>

<p>Not much he could do about any of West Brom's three first half goals, but did not do enough to suggest he will be the long-term replacement to Kepa.</p>

<p>Reece James - 5</p>

<p>A game to forget at right back. Better in attack than defence. Beaten by Robinson through his legs for opening goal and played Bartley onside, but recovered to deliver some dangerous crosses.</p>

<p>Andreas Christensen - 6</p>

<p>One of the better Chelsea defenders in that he did not commit any obvious howlers.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva - 5</p>

<p>Schoolboy error to gift Robinson West Brom's second after initially looking solid as captain on his Premier League debut. Will have better days.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva was guilty of committing a schoolboy error and will certainly have better days</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso - 4</p>

<p>Sloppy header to concede possession for West Brom's early goal, booked after beaten for pace by Ajayi. Replaced at half-time.</p>

<p>N'Golo Kante - 6 </p>

<p>Tireless running from the French international midfielder and still reads the game better than most.</p>

<p>Mateo Kovacic - 5</p>

<p>Did his best to keep things ticking in midfield and justify selection ahead of Jorginho, but did not do enough to stop Lampard taking him off after 45 minutes. Replacement Hudson Odoi an upgrade.</p>

<p>Mason Mount - 7</p>

<p>One of the few Chelsea players to emerge with credit. A strong first half followed up by a brilliant strike to get his side back into the match.</p>

<p>Mason Mount is one of the few Chelsea players to emerge with credit and netted from distance</p>

<p>Kai Havertz - 6</p>

<p>Another position for Chelsea's record signing to try and one of some promise, but little end product.</p>

<p>Timo Werner - 6</p>

<p>Will not come much closer to his first Premier League strike than his first half volley against the bar. Instrumental in Chelsea's second, but needs a goal.</p>

<p>Timo Werner clattered a first half volley against the woodwork and needs his first Chelsea goal</p>

<p>Tammy Abraham - 5</p>

<p>Wasted great chances to justify his first Premier League start of the season before his tap in for the dramatic late equaliser.</p>

<p>Subs</p>

<p>Hudson-Odoi (replaced Kovacic 45 mins) 6</p>

<p>Azpilicueta (replaced Alonso 45 mins) 6</p>

<p>Giroud (replaced Silva 73 mins)</p>

<p>Subs not used: Arrizabalaga, Jorginho, Barkley, Tomori</p>

<p>Referee: Jon Moss 6</p>
