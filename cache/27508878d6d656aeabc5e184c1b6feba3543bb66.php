<p>The clip starts with her spouse rubbing her feet after she had a yoga session.</p>

<p>'So I had a meeting with my mom the other day that left me feeling not so good,' started the reality TV standout.</p>

<p>She then relays to the camera that if she does not cut off her mom financially, her marriage will be 'over.'</p>

<p>Then she is seen sitting in a luxury home with her mother.</p>

<p>Ashley is at the head of the table while her mom, dressed in a pretty green, white and black leopard print top, sits to her side.</p>

<p>The mother looks downcast with no makeup on as she twirls the noodles in her soup bowl.</p>

<p>Not thrilled: 'So I had a meeting with my mom the other day that left me feeling not so good,' started the reality TV standout</p>

<p>Sad girl: 'This was by far one of the most difficult conversations I've ever had,' said the TV veteran</p>

<p>'It would be unfair to just say hey mom you're on your own and I would never do that to you ever in my life,' says the fitness enthusiast who wears a white halter top as a Corona beer sits in front of her.</p>

<p>'But at the same time I have this checklist,' continues Ashley who pulls out pieces of paper.</p>

<p>The mother starts to tear up and touches her face as she looks overwhelmed by the subject of the conversation.</p>

<p>TENSE: Then she is seen sitting in a luxury home with her mother. Ashley is at the head of the table while her mom, dressed in a pretty green, white and black leopard print top, sits to her side</p>

<p>Not having fun: The mother looks downcast with no makeup on as she twirls the noodles in her soup bowl</p>

<p>'The idea is basically you would begin to take control of you life,' added Ashley, who looks like she is struggling with this conversation but will power through.</p>

<p>Her mother cries then says, 'It's not a nice spot to be in.'</p>

<p>Then the clip turns to Ashley all made up with a green cage lace dress on in her living room. She says, 'I think I handled it pretty well. I think I was tough - tough love.'</p>

<p>No cash: 'It would be unfair to just say hey mom you're on your own and I would never do that to you ever in my life,' says the fitness enthusiast who wears a white halter top as a Corona beer sits in front of her</p>

<p>A list! 'But at the same time I have this checklist,' continues Ashley who pulls out pieces of paper</p>

<p>Tears: The mother starts to tear up and touches her face as she looks overwhelmed by the subject of the conversation</p>

<p>Sad turn: 'The idea is basically you would begin to take control of you life,' added Ashley, who looks like she is struggling with this conversation but will power through. Her mother cries then says, 'It's not a nice spot to be in'</p>

<p>Next her husband is seen on the sofa again where he is rubbing his wife's feet. 'Hmmm, interesting,' he says after she conveys the conversation.</p>

<p>He then goes on to say she needs to tell her mother explicitly that she is being cut off. 'You need to cut her off now,' says her spouse pointing his finger for emphasis.</p>

<p>Ashley says she cannot do that.</p>

<p>'This is my mom and I still have a heart, but I don't know what more I can possibly do without sacrificing my own sanity,' says Ashley during her sit-down interview.</p>

<p>Tough lady: Then the clip turns to Ashley all made up with a green cage lace dress on in her living room. She says, 'I think I handled it pretty well. I think I was tough - tough love'</p>

<p>This comes after she shocked fans by sharing that she and her husband have had 'threesomes.'</p>

<p>'Michael and I have been in situations where we have been with other people before,' admitted the star. </p>

<p>The admission comes after series regulars Gizelle Bryant and Candiace Dillard unveiled that Michael was allegedly with several strippers, telling people he had a wife and a boyfriend, and apparently trying to 'hook up.'</p>

<p>NO MONEY! Next her husband is seen on the sofa again. 'Hmmm, interesting,' he says. He then goes on to say she needs to tell her mother explicitly that she is being cut off. 'You need to cut her off now,' says her spouse pointing his finger for emphasis</p>

<p>Ashley added that her and Michael's 'marriage has had its own identity.'</p>

<p>After shocking the room with her candidness, Darby went on to provide an example of a memorable threesome she partook in at a David Guetta concert. </p>

<p>'For example, we were hanging out at the David Guetta concert and, you know, I saw someone that I was attracted to and...' she said before trailing off, insinuating that the attraction led to a threesome.</p>

<p>Monique Samuels, 36, not content with Ashley's subtly, asked her directly if her and Michael 'had a threesome' with the unnamed woman at the concert.</p>

<p>Spilling the beans: Darby opened up to her Real Housewives Of Potomac co-stars about consensually engaging in 'threesomes' with husband Michael</p>

<p>Say what? 'For example, we were hanging out at the David Guetta concert and, you know, I saw someone that I was attracted to and...' she said before trailing off, insinuating that the attraction led to a threesome</p>

<p>'Yes,' she replied coyly. This prompted the entire room to erupt in further shock and loud, jumbled chatter. </p>

<p>'It was two guys?' asked Monique, to which Darby clarified: 'No, it was a girl.' </p>

<p>In her confessional, Karen Huger, 57, said that, although she 'appreciates Ashley talking [to the group]' about the complexities of her and Michael's marriage, it came as no surprise to anyone.</p>

<p>'We already filled in the blanks. I know I have and I am ok with it.'</p>

<p>Not a surprise: In her confessional, Karen Huger, 57, said that, although she 'appreciates Ashley talking [to the group]' about the complexities of her and Michael's marriage, it came as no surprise to anyone</p>

<p>With cheating allegations at play, Huger attempted to clarify the state of Ashley's marriage for the rest of the group. </p>

<p>'Are you in a monogamous place right now? Because I feel that you are,' asked Karen.</p>

<p>Ashley insisted that she 'doesn't want anything with anybody else' and if Michael is caught in anymore infidelity-related drama that she is 'done.'</p>

<p>Ashley, who already shares son Dean with Michael, revealed last week on her Instagram that she's expecting her second child with the politician.  </p>

<p>Last year, Michael was alleged to have made a sexual comment about one of Housewives' husbands.</p>

<p>'After the night died down, Michael walked past us and said, "Yeah, I would suck his d***,''' Dixon told Ashley on the show. 'You were there. You all were walking past us.'</p>

<p>Despite one of her fellow Housewives claiming Michael said it, Ashley adamantly denied he'd made the comment.</p>

<p>The Real Housewives of Potomac can be seen on Bravo Sunday at 9/8c.  </p>
