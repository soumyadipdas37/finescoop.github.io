<p>A Utah grandmother has been charged with obstruction of justice for allegedly refusing to tell police the whereabouts of her six-year-old grandson who authorities say was kidnapped by his biological mother over the weekend. </p>

<p>Timothy Butler, the father of Terran Butler, contacted law enforcement to report that his son had been kidnapped on Saturday. </p>

<p>According to a statement from the Unified Police Department, Terran was on a court supervised visit with his biological mother, Emily Jolley, 43, and her mother, Larain Latter Jolley, when the alleged kidnapping occurred. </p>

<p>Police said Terran's father attempted to pick him up from the home only to discover that Emily had taken him from the residence without consent. </p>

<p>Terran, who still hasn't been located, was last seen in the area of Millcreek with Emily Jolley. </p>

<p>Latter was arrested by officers at her Millcreek home on Sunday, a day after an Amber Alert was issued for her grandson. </p>

<p>According to Fox13, Latter was the adult supervising the visit. Terran's dad said that he tried contacting both Latter and Jolley before he reported the kidnapping to police. </p>

<p>Upon arriving to Latter's home, police conducted a search for Terran. Later, in an interview, Latter admitted to police that she knew her grandson was safe, according to Fox13. </p>

<p>Her bail has been set at $10,000. </p>

<p>According to a Facebook post from Butler's girlfriend, Amelia Jensen Meneses, it's believed that Jolley had been planning the kidnapping 'for months even years'. </p>

<p>Jolley is reportedly driving a blue 2008 Toyota Prius that has a Utah license plate with the number E847GT.</p>

<p>'Emily has ties to Washington State and may be traveling to Washington with Terran,' authorities said in a statement. </p>
