<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A timber lorry fell onto its side and spilled all its logs after one of its rear wheels got stuck in a ditch while attempting to turn in the road.</p>

<p>The unfortunate accident was recorded in Louisville, Mississippi, and shows a red logging truck already stretched out across both lanes of a wide road.</p>

<p>At the start of the video, the truck's cabin faces towards the camera, as if the lorry had attempted to complete a tight turn out of the nearby gas station.  </p>

<p>A red timber truck tips over and spills its load onto a road in Louisville, Mississippi, after attempting a tight turn and overbalancing</p>

<p>The truck tilts dangerously on its side, with some of its rear wheels left hanging in the air.</p>

<p>Off balance, the lorry tries to correct itself by reversing back round the corner before attempting to drive off again, launching a cloud of smoke into the air from its exhausts.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one wheel gets caught in a ditch as the lorry tries to pull away causing the entire vehicle to topple over in the middle of the road.</p>

<p>The cab's hood visibly lifts away under the pressure of the trailer rolling over.</p>

<p>The truck had attempted to turn too sharply round a corner and had also got one of its wheel stuck in a ditch. Both factors caused the truck to topple over</p>

<p>As the truck tips over, all of the logs it's carrying spill out into the road, completely blocking it.</p>

<p>Speaking after the event, the person who filmed the toppling truck said: 'I was sitting in the road blocked by this truck trying to turn around or enter the road.' </p>

<p>The incident was filmed on May 14 but was recently re-emerged after being shared on social media. </p>
