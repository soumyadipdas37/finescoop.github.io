<p>'It's nice for the girls seeing their mum doing so well': Marvin Humes admitted on Friday's Loose Women that he loves the fact wife Rochelle earns more money than he does</p>

<p>'Growing up, both my mum and dad did the same amount of hours, so I've grown up with my mum and dad earning equally. </p>

<p>'It's nice for the girls seeing their mum doing so well and working so hard for what she wants, it's no problem at all.'</p>

<p>Rochelle is currently expecting their third baby, a son, in four weeks, and Marvin joked that even if she was due to give birth in 48 hours he would still head out to the Old Trafford to play in the charity football match.</p>

<p>He jokingly told Mark: '100 per cent. I don’t know how many years of this I’ve got left. Sorry, Roch!'</p>

<p>Olly also detailed how his girlfriend Amelia Tank was the main breadwinner for their household as he said the coronavirus pandemic has left him unemployed.</p>

<p>'At the moment, work is cancelled at the moment, I'm not doing anything. I'm self-employed, so at the moment, she's paying the bills,' he admitted.</p>

<p>While Mark said of wife Michelle Keegan: 'My wife works half and does very well. But when it comes to dating, going out, I insist on paying the bill. I don't know why, I always insist. </p>

<p>'So maybe it's the old fashioned way. When I was young, i don't remember my mum working so much, she was a great housewife, now she wants to work more than she used to do, she wants to try new thing. '</p>
