<p>And the Britain's Got Talent semi-finalists were in high spirits as they arrived for filming in London on Friday.</p>

<p>Stars in the making! Britain's Got Talent's semi-finalists were in high spirits as they arrived for filming in London on Friday</p>

<p>As they headed into filming, the contestants were certainly dressed to win as they donned reflective gold boiler suits with their protective masks.</p>

<p>They'll be hoping to win over the virtual audience, along with judges Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and Ashley Banjo, to win a spot in the final, which will air live in October.</p>

<p>Due to the COVID-19 crisis, bosses have introduced strict new social distancing measures for filming, which includes the judges being placed on separate desks two metres apart.</p>

<p>Hard to miss! The contestants were dressed in gold boiler suits and protective face masks as they were guided into the studio by crew members</p>

<p>Raring to go! With their bold metallic ensembles the contestants were on a mission to catch the judges eye during their performance</p>

<p>Determined: They'll be hoping to win over judges Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and Ashley Banjo, to win a spot in the final, which will air live in October</p>

<p>Simon Cowell will be noticeably absent from the semi-finals after breaking his back in a freak accident on his electric bike.</p>

<p>The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.</p>

<p>Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, "Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"</p>

<p>'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.' </p>

<p>Changes: Due to the COVID-19 crisis, bosses have introduced strict new social distancing measures for filming, with the semi-finals being pre-recorded for the first time</p>

<p>Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. </p>

<p>The BGT semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, will now take place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. </p>

<p>As usual, Ant and Dec will host the semi-finals, with the pair forming a 'cohort,' meaning they do not have socially distanced from each other.</p>

<p>Plans: Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs</p>

<p>Transitions: Some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen</p>

<p>With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences’ reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.</p>

<p>The series will then culminate with the live final where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.</p>

<p>Britain's Got Talent returns on Saturday at 8pm on ITV.</p>

<p>Two metres! The judges have also been placed on separate desks to ensure they adhere to social distancing measures</p>
