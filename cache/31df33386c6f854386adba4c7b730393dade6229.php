<p>The Yoruba people come to the grove from across Nigeria to offer sacrifices to their fertility goddess, Osun.   </p>

<p>Mr Jolaosho, a popular adult movie producer, uploaded the clip to his social media accounts and website. In the scene, Mr Jolaosho is allegedly dressed in a white robe, which is usually worn by the goddess's followers, the BBC reported.</p>

<p>Tobiloba Jolaosho (pictured), known in the Nigerian adult film industry as King Tblak HOC, has been arrested for allegedly recording a 'sex movie' at Osun Osogbo - a UN-designated World Heritage Site on the outskirts of the city of Osugbo</p>

<p>Police spokesman Opalola Yemisi told BBC Yoruba the movie producer's behaviour   'could have breached public peace' and that he will appear in court after an investigation is concluded. </p>

<p>Yemi Elebuibon, an Osun adherent, said that Mr Jolaosho had desecrated the sacred forest. </p>

<p>Mr Elebuibon added that the traditional worshippers in charge of the grove will decide what additional punishment Mr Jolaosho deserves after the police have finished their investigation. </p>

<p>Neither Mr Jolaosho nor his lawyer have commented on the case. </p>

<p>UNESCO describes the sacred grove as 'dotted with sanctuaries and shrines, sculptues and art works in honour of Osun and other deities'. </p>

<p>'The sacred grove, which is now seen as a symbol of identity for all Yoruba people, is probably the last in Yoruba culture,' it adds.  </p>

<p>According to Yoruba mythology, Osun was one of the three wives of Shango, a powerful axe-wielding deity in the Yoruba tradition.      </p>

<p>Thousands of people attend the two-week Osun Osogbo festival each year, where followers dance, sing, play drums and dress in colourful costumes to please the goddess. </p>

<p>The celebrations attract worshippers from across Nigeria and the rest of the world. </p>

<p>Yoruba followers say the Osun Osogbo forest is one of the few places that spirits still reveal themselves to bless adherents.   </p>
