<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former underground ammunition bunker used during World War II has been turned into a cosy 12-metre-long house.</p>

<p>David and Julie Hinds purchased several old concrete-lined sheds at RAAF Kowguran in Miles, 337km north-west of Brisbane, in 1986.</p>

<p>The base had been abandoned for 30 years when the couple purchased the land and moved in to one of the sheds, converting it into their dream home.</p>

<p>They have since turned the area into holiday homes called Possum Park, where people can park their caravans or stay in one of the bunkers. </p>

<p>'I think I must have said, "wouldn't it be good to live in here", and the rest is history,' Mrs Hinds told the ABC.</p>

<p>David and Julie Hinds purchased the property in 1986 and moved into one of the concrete bunkers (pictured, the cosy kitchen)</p>

<p>The bunkers, 337km north-west of Brisbane, (pictured) were used as an ammunition storage facility during World War II</p>

<p>She explained that while the renovation has been an adventure, they were met with a spate of problems including minimal mobile phone reception and issues with securing plumbing. </p>

<p>The couple had previously lived in a large farm house, meaning small cupboards and curved walls took some getting used to - and made it impossible to hang paintings.</p>

<p>Mr Hinds said the property was regarded as a secret base at the time.</p>

<p>'The townspeople would not have known what exactly what was going on, although the servicemen probably talked about it, and word gets around a small town,' he said. </p>

<p>The couple said they have had several vistors who served on the base between 1946, when it was founded, and 1956.</p>

<p>The men who served on the base used to live in wooden barracks, which were cool in winter and warm in summer.</p>

<p>Mr Hinds said the concrete bunkers have the opposite effect.  </p>

<p>They have since turned the area into an accommodation called Possum Park, where people can park their caravans or stay in one of the bunkers (pictured)</p>

<p>The couple said they have had visitors from people who served on the base between 1946, when it was founded, and 1956 (pictured, a double bedroom at the base)</p>

<p>Many of the bunkers (pictured) had hay inside of them when Mr and Mrs Hinds first purchased the property</p>

<p>'They complimented us saying "we should have thrown the bombs outside and lived inside the bunkers ourselves",' he said.</p>

<p>Many of the bunkers had hay inside of them when Mr and Mrs Hinds first purchased the property.</p>

<p>The curved, concrete walls are ten inches thick and have a metre of earth on top of them, while the bunkers are 3m in radius and 12m long.  </p>

<p>The former explosive storage facility had 20 reinforced concrete storage bunkers that housed up to 2,500 tonnes of explosives.</p>

<p>Mrs Hinds said the bunkers (pictured in 1985) are perfect for two people to stay inside of with sound bouncing off of the walls</p>

<p>The area was seen as the 'last stand' if Australia was invaded through the northern part of the country, but the ammunition reserve was never needed. </p>

<p>The former base sits on a whopping 360-ache block of land.  </p>

<p>Several people who have stayed at the accommodation have raved about their experience.</p>

<p>'Pity we were only staying one night. The owners are wonderful people and have a very friendly dog who thinks he is the boss,' one social media user said.</p>

<p>Another said: 'Heard about this place through friends and after staying here we will be recommending it to our friends in the future. </p>

<p>'The place is not just accommodation, it is an experience. We stayed in the bunkers which (despite being dated as was renovated in the 80s) were very homely.'</p>
