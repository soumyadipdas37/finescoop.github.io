<p>Daniel Lee, 36, (pictured) ditched his job at the Brisbane shopping centre to become a real estate king pin</p>

<p>But to get where he is today he spent a gruelling six months when he was 22 working in shopping centres begging people to change their phone providers. </p>

<p>'It was commission only, so on a bad day i was earning nothing. I used to get $90 for a sale,' Mr Lee told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>He would work from 9am to 5pm on his feet, working 12 hour days standing up on days with late night shopping.</p>

<p>'It was brutal,' he said.  </p>

<p>'Most of the angry types would say get a real job! But other than people who would say something nasty would just ignore you. It was just rejection all day,' he said.</p>

<p>He said it's hard to imagine his life how much his life would change over the past decade</p>

<p>He worked for a real estate business for nine years before starting his own business Plum Property in 2016</p>

<p>'It was a terrible job and you wouldn't want to do it for more than six months. It took away all of my fear of rejection because you just stand there getting rejected all day.'</p>

<p>He became the top salesperson out of about 2,000 employees and after six months he had enough. </p>

<p>'I was getting like 1,200 bucks a week. And i thought f*** if I'm number one there's not really enough dough in it. So I thought I'll go and sell something that actually makes money,' he said. </p>

<p>He worked for a real estate business for nine years before starting his own business Plum Property in 2016. </p>

<p>Now he sells extravagent homes including this home in Indooroopilly which sold for $1,450,000 in June</p>

<p>He said it's hard to imagine his life how much his life would change over the past decade.</p>

<p>This includes selling a property for more than $3.2million dollars. </p>

<p>'When I think back to when I started the business, if you ever said to me in four years you will have 23 staff, you're looking for your 4th location because you keep growing out of your own office, your office has made 160million in the last 12 months... I would have thought not a chance.'  </p>

<p>The real estate agent is also a minor celebrity in his own neighborhood due to his viral videos. </p>

<p>'People recognise me in the supermarket and the shopping centre all the time, mainly around my area,' he said.</p>

<p>'If I go to Toowong or Indooroopilly pretty much every time I go there someone stops me and says - you're the guy from those videos,' he said.  </p>

<p>He has credited his success to social media.</p>

<p>His Instagram Account has accrued more than 6,000 followers and his videos have been viewed thousands of times.</p>

<p>He posts funny videos trying to showcase the property while keeping viewers engaged the whole time. </p>

<p>'I was just sick of this image of real estates... Look at me in my sharp suit in my hair and I'm so cool, and everyone hates this and I took a completely different angle.' </p>

<p>The real estate Principal is also a minor celebrity in his own neighborhood due to his viral videos on his Instagram account</p>
