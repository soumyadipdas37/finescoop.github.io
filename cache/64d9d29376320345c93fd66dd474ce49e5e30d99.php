<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Platinum Equity, one of the potential buyers for breakdown business AA has withdrawn from the race three weeks after a deadline for bids was extended.</p>

<p>The private equity firm said that it had walked away from discussions with AA's board 'by mutual agreement.'</p>

<p>The news was unwelcome among AA shareholders will many hitting the sell button, sending the stock down 17 per cent to 28p.</p>

<p>Â Platinum Equity has withdrawn from the race to buy the AA by mutual agreement</p>

<p>It follows months of speculation over the future of the business after it announced talks with three potential bidders in early August.</p>

<p>However, finding a buyer from the trio proved harder than first hoped, and earlier this month a deadline set by the UK's Takeover Panel passed without any bids arriving.</p>

<p>It forced AA to ask for an extension, with the new deadline set at September 29.</p>

<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Platinum said: 'Platinum Equity announces today that discussions with the board of AA have been terminated by mutual agreement and it does not intend to make an offer for AA.'</p>

<p>But the US investor reserved its right to make or participate in a possible offer for AA within six months. However, this will be only with the agreement of the AA's board and if a rival bid is made.</p>

<p>Platinum's withdrawal potentially leaves only one consortium left in the race.</p>

<p>Late last month reports emerged that rival bidder Warburg Pincus was talking to Centerbridge Partners and Towerbrook Capital Partners about combining forces rather than making competing bids for AA.</p>

<p>Last month AA said that its trading has been resilient during the pandemic and it expects only a small hit when it presents its results on September 29.</p>

<p>Chairman John Leach said the businesses needed to pay down debts in order reach its 'full potential'. He hopes that a private equity deal could help.</p>
