<p>Fun in the sun: The TOWIE star was clearly in good spirits as she sauntered up to large group and began to strike a series of dance moves</p>

<p>On Friday, she took to Instagram to upload a snap of herself in grey loungewear as she posed on a plush sofa with a rose in her mouth.</p>

<p>Gemma took the opportunity to promote her new range, as she wrote in the caption: 'I AM .... MY OWN WORK of ART.</p>

<p>'[T]he countdown begins my beautiful luxury lounge wear designed by moi will be available from next week.'</p>

<p>Talking to PlayOJO bingo on Wednesday, Gemma opened up about her weight loss journey, as she revealed: 'I use Skinny Jabs – it's a programme that I am on and I have managed to lost 3 stone on it.</p>

<p>'It is a full programme, you get nutrition advice, nice recipes and guidance and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to lose weight.'</p>

<p>Outfit: Gemma was dressed appropriately for the occasion and ensured she could move around with ease in a black jumper and matching leggings</p>

<p>She's got moves: The TV star looked like she was having the time of her life as she threw shapes next to a group on roller skates </p>

<p>Party: 'I need some skates,' she yelled before the person filming her jokingly replied: 'No you don't' </p>

<p>The television personality has previously come under fire for promoting the jab, which 'regulate the glucose level in your blood, allowing your body to use your stored fat for energy'.</p>

<p>This means that you can safely consume small portions without experiencing the undesired effects of starvation mode.</p>

<p>Gemma continued: 'My advice to anyone looking to start a weight loss journey would be adopt the right mindset.</p>

<p>'I believe that all bodies are beautiful, but if you want to make a change its really powerful to do it from a health-first perspective.'</p>

<p>'Express yourself': Gemma captioned the playful video: 'On SUNDAYS we have fun !!!! LONDON I LOVE YOU❤️ FREESTYLE EXPRESS YOURSELF' </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Gemma furiously hit back at brands who refused to dress her as she was 'too fat'.</p>

<p>Talking about TOWIE's 10th anniversary, she said: 'I was never the prettiest girl on the show. I never had the best body.</p>

<p>'Obviously I was confident when I went on the show, but a lot of clothing brands wouldn't lend me their clothing because they said I was too fat.</p>

<p>'I was a size 14/16, and you know I'm bigger now, and basically I've got my own clothing brand.</p>

<p>'So to everyone who wouldn't lend me clothing or put me in their brands, what you got to say now, huns?'</p>

<p>Gemma then brazenly stuck up two fingers to the camera with both hands before saying it had been 'amazing' looking back at the reality show that made her a household name.</p>
