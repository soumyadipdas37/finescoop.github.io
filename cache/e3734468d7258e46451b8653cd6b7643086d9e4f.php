<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dominic Raab today warned the UK 'could end up in a national lockdown' if Boris Johnson's new coronavirus crackdown fails to get the disease under control. </p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said a second shutdown 'is what we want to avoid' but the nuclear option remains in the Government's 'arsenal' if all else fails. </p>

<p>Mr Raab said he hoped 'if everyone plays by the rules' then the nation will be able to go into the Christmas period without a national lockdown being imposed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, he defended the Government's plans to allow the police to ask the Army for help in order to boost Covid-19 enforcement. </p>

<p>Mr Raab said military personnel could be drafted in to 'relieve capacity' and allow officers to concentrate on enforcing rules as he dismissed claims that soldiers will be patrolling the streets as 'scaremongering'. </p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary's intervention came after it was claimed that Professor Chris Whitty has told Mr Johnson that England will likely have to follow Scotland's lead in banning visits between separate households.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson yesterday announced a wave of new restrictions designed to stop the spread of coronavirus. </p>

<p>He imposed a 10pm curfew on pubs, bars and restaurants across England from tomorrow, extended rules on the mandatory wearing of face coverings and also urged workers to work from home where they can.</p>

<p>Members of the Government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said the curfew would not be enough to slow the rate of infection.</p>

<p>But Mr Johnson insisted his approach was based on trying to 'balance saving lives with protecting jobs and livelihoods'. </p>

<p>However, he said he reserved the right to 'deploy greater fire power' should it be necessary. </p>

<p>Mr Raab today said a second national lockdown could be needed to control the spread of coronavirus if the latest measures do not work. </p>

<p>He told Sky News: 'We've always said we've got a sort of repository of measures in the arsenal to take. </p>

<p>'I don't think we would speculate about what further could be done.</p>

<p>'But the reality is they will be more intrusive or we could end up in a national lockdown. That is what we want to avoid.'</p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary said that if 'everyone plays by the rules' then a national lockdown may not be needed at Christmas. </p>

<p>He said: 'Let's hope that we can get through the winter months if we take these measures and if everyone plays by the rules, and we go into Christmas not needing to go into that national lockdown with all the impact on society and families but also the damage it would do to businesses.'</p>

<p>Mr Raab also defended the Government's 10pm curfew on hospitality, despite figures suggesting just five per cent of coronavirus cases are linked to pubs, bars and restaurants.</p>

<p>'We know that in bars and restaurants, particularly after people have had a few drinks, as you go into the later hours of the evening, that there's a risk that the compliance with the guidance ebbs a little bit,' he said. </p>

<p>'So we're taking this measure, we're confident based on the evidence that we've got domestically and internationally that it's one element of those that we need to make.'</p>

<p>Mr Raab also defended the Government's decision to offer military support to the police to free up officers to focus on enforcing coronavirus rules and imposing fines on rule breakers. </p>

<p>He said: 'The reality is there will be stronger enforcement, more powers for the police, higher levels of fines, mainly for the small minority who haven't complied always with the rules. </p>

<p>'We don't want them to blow it for the vast majority of people and end up in a second lockdown. </p>

<p>'The issue with the army, as throughout this pandemic they have been used to backfill, to support, for example local authorities with testing, delivery of PPE and if they can relieve any capacity for the police to do the very difficult job that they have done incredibly well, they will be there to do that.' </p>

<p>He said suggestions that there could be troops patrolling the streets was 'scaremongering'. </p>

<p>Number 10 has stressed that soldiers will not be enforcing the rules and will be used to fill office roles or guard protected sites. </p>

<p>However, senior police figures have rejected the offer of help and said it is unnecessary. </p>

<p>Martin Hewitt, chairman of the National Police Chiefs Council, said: 'Any military support must be assessed carefully. At the moment, no military involvement is necessary, nor do we anticipate this will be needed.' </p>

<p>John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation, said: 'This is not what policing has asked for and not what is needed.'  </p>

<p>Mr Johnson's new coronavirus clampdown faced swift scrutiny after Nicola Sturgeon went further than the PM and announced a ban on households mixing indoors in Scotland. </p>

<p>The Times reported today that Prof Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, has told Mr Johnson that England will likely have to follow Scotland's lead on the issue.</p>

<p>Prof Whitty is said to believe that further restrictions are inevitable and new measures like the curfew will not be enough on their own to get the virus under control.</p>

<p>His deputies Jonathan Van Tam and Jenny Harries are also said to have expressed concerns that the PM's measures do not go far enough but the trio apparently backed Mr Johnson trying his more limited restrictions first.   </p>

<p>Mr Raab said this morning there would always be the 'Goldilocks criticism – too much or too little' whenever new measures are announced. </p>

<p>But he said the Government was taking a 'balanced, targeted and proportionate approach' and insisted the four home nations had overwhelmingly taken a 'consistent' approach.  </p>

<p>He told BBC Breakfast: 'There's always an evidence basis which we all look at, it's slightly different in the four parts of the UK, although actually overwhelmingly we've taken a consistent and common approach.</p>

<p>'We recognise that the devolved administrations have the authority to decide things in a slightly different way.'  </p>
