<p>Many people find words such as ‘fat’ ‘chubby’ or ‘plus-size’ upsetting or offensive, a British study found.</p>

<p>Researchers suggested that GPs and other healthcare workers should make a ‘conscious effort’ to ask patients prior to appointments what terms they prefer.</p>

<p>Many patients favour more neutral language such as ‘overweight’ or ‘body mass index’ as they find it less distressing.</p>

<p>Obese patients should be able to pick what language doctors use to refer to their excess weight so not to upset them, experts have said (file)</p>

<p>A study by the University of Leeds and University College London examined the importance of language used by doctors, nurses and midwives when addressing overweight patients.</p>

<p>Nearly 3,000 adults, most of whom were overweight or obese, were asked what they prefer and questioned over their emotional response to different words.</p>

<p>People who eat most of their calories after 6pm tend to have unhealthier diets and eat more overall, according to a study.</p>

<p>Researchers said that late eaters were more likely to gain weight because they tend to let themselves get extremely hungry during the day.</p>

<p>This makes them more prone to binge eating, making bad food choices and eating junk food in the evening. </p>

<p>Whereas those who consume their biggest meals earlier in the day are often too full to stuff their faces at night. </p>

<p>For the latest study, researchers from Ulster University in Northern Ireland looked at more than 1,100 adults as part of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey.</p>

<p>The nationwide survey began in 2008 and collects detailed information on the food consumption, nutrient intake and nutritional status. </p>

<p>The volunteers - aged 19 to 64 - were quizzed about their meal timings and food choices.  </p>

<p>The researchers found those who ate 30 per cent or less of their food at night consumed less total calories overall than any group.</p>

<p>Whereas those who ate half of their calories at night were more likely to gain weight and consume food with little nutrition.</p>

<p>Words including ‘chubby’, ‘super obese’ and ‘fat’ were found to provoke the highest feelings of sadness, disgust, contempt and anger.</p>

<p>These emotions can in turn undermine attempts to get patients to engage with weight loss programmes and deter them from seeking medical support, experts said.</p>

<p>Most people said they would rather doctors used terms such as ‘weight’, ‘unhealthy weight’, and ‘body mass index’.</p>

<p>But the authors said that, if possible, healthcare professionals should ask patients for their ‘preferred weight-related terminology’ before consultations.</p>

<p>Lead author Dr Stuart William Flint, from the University of Leeds, said the guidance is applicable across all NHS settings, including GP surgeries and hospitals.</p>

<p>He said: ‘The general message for healthcare professionals is to be more cautious about the terms they are using because it can have a detrimental impact.</p>

<p>‘Patients should be asked what term they prefer to be used in the consultations where it is necessary to discuss weight.</p>

<p>‘If you’re going to speak about weight management or weight, start by eliciting what the patients’ preferred terms are.</p>

<p>‘There is no one-size-fits-all approach to which language to use. Some people may prefer “overweight” or “obesity”.</p>

<p>‘Some people dislike the term fat because it is often associated with bullying in schools, leading to feelings of anger and disgust.</p>

<p>‘It is important to ensure people are comfortable and at-ease will want to continue to engage in a positive fashion.’</p>

<p>Dr Flint said that terms such as tubby, chunky, and chubby have been ‘ingrained’ in society but provoke negative emotions.</p>

<p>‘Use of inappropriate language can have a negative impact on the patient-doctor relationship. This can not only have a negative impact on someone’s emotional and mental health, it can also deter them from seeking medical or healthcare support in the future,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Weight stigma in society can cause people to internalise stereotypes around laziness, gluttony and lower intelligence and believe these stereotypes are true.</p>

<p>‘This is associated with mental health concerns, lower self-esteem and depression.’</p>

<p>The charity Obesity UK has recently released a guide called ‘language matters’ advising doctors to avoid using non-medical terms when talking to obese patients.</p>

<p>It urges doctors to avoid ‘non-clinical terms, which can be disrespectful, judgmental and inappropriate’ such as: ‘You’re a bit on the chunky side, shall we say.’</p>

<p>The charity says language should be free from ‘judgement or negative connotations’ and that doctors should ‘ask permission’ to discuss a patient’s weight.</p>
