<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>JobKeeper handouts have been officially extended for an extra six months with a new two-tiered approach, with all eligible workers losing at least $300.</p>

<p>Wage subsidies were introduced by the federal government to tide over workers until businesses reopened after lockdowns ended.</p>

<p>The scheme was supposed to end in September but on Tuesday it was extended until March 28, 2021.</p>

<p>A new split system will replace flat $1,500 subsidies paid each fortnight.</p>

<p>Wage subsidies were introduced by the federal government to tide over workers until businesses reopened (pictured, a bar worker in Bunbury during the pandemic)</p>

<p>People who worked less than 20 hours a week before the crisis struck will be paid $750 a fortnight from the end of September, while all others will receive $1,200.</p>

<p>The maximum payment will then come down to $1,000 from December to March 2021. </p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison described the wage subsidy scheme as the most significant economic intervention in Australia's history.</p>

<p>'We are now extending and transitioning,' Mr Morrison told coalition party room colleagues on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'Transitioning and looking to a day when Australian communities don't need JobKeeper and when Australians can then run their businesses and hold their jobs sustained by a vibrant and growing economy instead.'</p>

<p>The second tranche of JobKeeper payments is expected to cost more than $30 billion.  </p>

<p>Labor waved through the extension after failing to introduce a wage floor for workers who are no longer eligible for the scheme.</p>

<p>Independent senator Rex Patrick also could not secure enough support for an amendment to force businesses that have paid dividends or executive bonuses to repay the wage subsidies.</p>
