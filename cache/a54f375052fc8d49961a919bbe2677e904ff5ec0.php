<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Roger Federer has been dragged into the dramatic Novak Djokovic saga just days after the Serbian was controversially defaulted from the US Open. </p>

<p>The world No 1 was booted out of the Grand Slam in dramatic fashion when he swiped a ball to the back of the court angrily, only for it inadvertently to strike Kentucky-based official Laura Clark in the throat.</p>

<p>The line judge fell to the floor and after consultation with the referee, officials determined they had no option but to disqualify Djokovic. </p>

<p>But days on from the controversial incident, fans have been quick to slam the decision to disqualify Djokovic - claiming 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer wouldn't have faced the same punishment if he was in the Serbian's shoes.</p>

<p>Federer was involved in a similar incident 14 years ago at the Australian Open when he accidentally hit a ball boy.</p>

<p>After his first serve was called out, Federer swung his racket behind his back and inadvertently hit the ball boy at the side of the net.</p>

<p>The Swiss tennis star didn't receive a code violation and the situation was laughed off, including by the ball boy, at the time.</p>

<p>However, fans have since brought that incident back up as they have been comparing it to the Djokovic saga. </p>

<p>The incident involving Federer back in 2006 was laughed off by everyone court-side</p>

<p>The ball boy from that day wrote on Twitter: '2020: <?php echo e('@'); ?>DjokerNole hits line umpire...disqualified from the US Open. 2006: <?php echo e('@'); ?>rogerfederer does a trick shot and hits me...says 'you got to be ready' and has a chuckle.</p>

<p>'It's been 14 tough years, Roger, is it time for an apology?'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another tennis fan simply said: 'If Federer did what Djokovic did he wouldn't be disqualified. The ATP hates to see Djokovic win.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'I'm not the biggest Djokovic fan but I would 100% agree that there was no anger or malice in that incident. </p>

<p>'I can't believe the extent of his punishment. I also agree that had that been Federer it would have been a totally different outcome.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, only two weeks ago at the Southern &amp; Western Open - which Djokovic won - Aljaz Bedene accidentally struck a cameraman after hitting the ball away in frustration.</p>

<p>The ball boy that was struck by Federer tweets after Djokovic was disqualified </p>

<p>Tennis fans were quick yo drag Federer into the argument after Djokovic's controversial saga</p>

<p>Bedene immediately apologised but the tournament official was called out to judge whether he should have been defaulted.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Bedene, he wasn't - receiving just a code violation instead.</p>

<p>And following that recent incident and Djokovic's disqualification, fans still found a way to bring Federer's name into it.</p>

<p>One fan wrote on social media: 'Good job guys, nice to see no.1 had the same treatment. I just hope he never plays here again. </p>

<p>'I just wonder what decision would be if Federer was in this situation? <?php echo e('@'); ?>DjokerNole.'</p>
