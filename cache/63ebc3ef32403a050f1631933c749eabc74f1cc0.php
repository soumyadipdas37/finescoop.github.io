<p>Unknown to the veteran radio hosts, Shane was silently waiting for his interview on a satellite feed in a Melbourne studio.</p>

<p>Kyle said it had been a hectic morning and claimed one of his 'annoying' producers kept pestering him about his upcoming interview with the Kenny star.</p>

<p>'I screamed at the producer and said, "I don't give a f<strong>k about Kenny the dunny guy! He can wait all f</strong>king day for all I care,"' he recounted.</p>

<p>Jackie, 45, then interjected and reminded Kyle that he had actually referred to Shane as a 'Z-lister', describing the unfortunate incident as 'awful'.</p>

<p>'You called him a Z-lister. You said, "I'm not prerecording this Z-lister. Nobody even knows who he is,"' she reminded him.</p>

<p>Kyle admitted he 'felt bad' after learning Shane had overheard his whole conversation with the producer.</p>

<p>Slip of the tongue: Kyle admitted he 'felt bad' after learning Shane had overheard his whole conversation with the producer</p>

<p>But he said Shane graciously laughed off the criticism, prompting Kyle to confess he would've handled it much differently if it had happened to him.</p>

<p>'I felt for him because I thought if that was me hearing someone, I'd bash them nearly to death. I know I would. I wouldn't be able to handle it,' he admitted.</p>

<p>Jackie said Shane's willingness to brush off Kyle's harsh remarks just proved he's 'the biggest sweetheart'.    </p>
