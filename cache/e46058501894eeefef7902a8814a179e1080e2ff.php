<p>Real Techniques' affordable super-soft and bright orange makeup sponge has become renowned for its makeup blending abilities (foundation, cream blusher, contour and concealer – you name it).</p>

<p>They're bigger than most blenders and feature a tapered pointy precision tip to target hard-to-reach areas like around the nose, rounded sides for effortless blending, and a flat edge for contouring.</p>

<p>When dampened, the sponge swells up to twice its original size. Not only will this give you more of a natural finish that you can build upon, but it prevents the sponge  soaking up excess foundation. It will help you get the best foundation finish of your life, trust us.</p>

<p>According to one review on Amazon, the 'finish you can achieve with these sponges is so much nicer than makeup applied with a brush or fingers'.</p>
