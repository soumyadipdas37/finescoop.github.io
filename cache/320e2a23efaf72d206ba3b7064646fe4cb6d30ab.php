<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fast food giant McDonald's have sued Hungry Jack's for trademark infringement after they launched their new 'Big Jack' burger. </p>

<p>McDonald's Asia Pacific filed documents in Federal Court against the Australian burger chain on August 28.</p>

<p>The documents claim Hungry Jack's 'Big Jack' trademark is 'substantially identical with or deceptively similar' to McDonald's Big Mac trademark.</p>

<p>McDonald's have held the 'Big Mac' trademark since 1973 and claim Hungry Jack's used 'flagrant or wilful disregard' in promoting their 'Big Jack' burger.</p>

<p>McDonald's have sued Hungry Jack's over their 'Big Jack' burger (pictured) and trademark</p>

<p>They believe the 'Big Jack' trademark 'is liable to be cancelled' because it is 'likely to deceive or cause confusion'.</p>

<p>Hungry Jacks applied for their 'Big Jack' trademark in November, which was accepted in February.  </p>

<p>They launched the 'Big Jack' in August before posting images to its website and social media pages.</p>

<p>It features 'two flame-grilled 100 per cent Aussie beef patties', special sauce, melted cheese, pickles and onions on a toasted sesame seed bun.</p>

<p>Eagle-eyed customers were quick to mock the chain's new creation on Facebook.</p>

<p>'Did they just steal the Big Mac?' one asked.</p>

<p>McDonald's believe the Big Jack is 'substantially identical or similar' to their own Big Mac (pictured)</p>

<p>A Hungry Jack's spokesperson said they had 'not been served any formal documents from the court'. Pictured: an empty Hungry Jack's store in Melbourne during the coronavirus pandemic in March</p>

<p>'That's literally a Big Mac,' another commented.</p>

<p>'I sense a lawsuit,' one hinted.</p>

<p>'I like how they're embracing their plagiarism,' someone else wrote.</p>

<p>'Looks exactly like a Big Mac only different name,' another wrote.</p>

<p>However Hungry Jack's appeared to recognise the cheeky nod to its rival with a comment.</p>

<p>'There's something…''special'' about our new Big Jack. It must be the flame-grilled Aussie beef,' Hungry Jack's wrote on Facebook with a cheeky winking emoji.</p>

<p>McDonald's want Hungry Jack's to destroy all material they have using the 'Big Jack' trademark. </p>

<p>'Hungry Jack's has not been served any formal documents from the court and, thus, is unable to provide any comment at this stage,' a Hungry Jack's spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>A McDonald's Australia spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia 'as this matter is before the court, it is not appropriate to comment at this time.' </p>
