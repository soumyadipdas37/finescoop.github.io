<p>Police are appealing for public assistance to find the two 14-year-old girls.</p>

<p>Tasmanian detectives released an update about 8.30pm with new information that indicated the girls had 'attempted to alter their appearance' after leaving school grounds.</p>

<p>Madeline Dixon and Molly Martin were last seen leaving Collegiate Middle School in Hobart in school uniform at 8.45am on Wednesday morning</p>

<p>Police claim both teens were last spotted together about 2.10pm on a bus from Rosny to Carlton.</p>

<p>They indicated they would get off the bus at Sorell, and police have reason to believe both Madeline and Molly remain in the area.</p>

<p>One of Maddie's relatives admitted he had 'no clue' who she would know in the region.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't have a clue who she associates with as her side of the family doesn't really talk to mine as much as we'd all like to,' he said.</p>

<p>'I just hope she's okay and nothing needs to be taken any further.'</p>
