<p>The collection, called Wearable Art, is the first of its kind, as it allows you to build your own design onto a denim jacket, hoodie, sweatshirt and other items of clothing (pictured)</p>

<p>The collection features the iconic Lego colour palette on all of its items (pictured)</p>

<p>'I plan on sporting this entire line,' one eager shopper wrote of the collection.</p>

<p>'I need these in my life,' another person added.</p>

<p>Almost every piece in the collection - from hoodies to bum bags - is customisable with little pieces of Lego.</p>

<p>The collaboration features the first-ever flexible Lego baseplate, which is a pliable Lego silicone panel onto which fans can create their own customised designs using Lego dots.</p>

<p>The collection isn't just sweatshirts, hoodies and denim jackets and jeans, as it also contains bum bags (pictured) and hats</p>

<p>Launching on October 1, the collection is already proving popular with fashionistas and lovers of Lego past and present (pieces from the collection pictured)</p>

<p>'This is such a fun collaboration celebrating self-expression, creativity and nostalgia,' Chief Product Officer for Levi Strauss &amp; Co Karyn Hillman told FEMAIL. </p>

<p>'It's Levi's and the Lego Group coming together to co-create something really special and new, but undeniably familiar.</p>

<p>'With the customisable baseplates, Levi's is now literally a new blank canvas for Lego play.' </p>

<p>In addition to the sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets, the collection also includes bags, hats, and even a cargo vest.</p>

<p>All of them feature fun Lego-inspired details like colourful buttons and a bright-red Lego patch swapped in instead of Levi's traditional leather version.</p>

<p>The limited edition line will be available in selected Levi's stores across Australia and New Zealand and online from October 1.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Lego has teamed up with a fashion or homewares brand.</p>

<p>In the past, the iconic toy brand has collaborated with both IKEA and Adidas. </p>

<p>Lego Adidas sneakers were especially popular with shoppers, which featured the original Lego logo as well as some Lego blocks on the lace tags. </p>
