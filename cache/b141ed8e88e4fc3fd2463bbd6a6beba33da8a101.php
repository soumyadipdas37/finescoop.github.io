<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boris Johnson's fiancée Carrie Symonds has revealed she will be judging a virtual lip sync battle hosted by the Conservatives LGBT+ wing. </p>

<p>The London-based conservationist, 32, said she was 'looking forward' to judging the event, which is part of party's conference, which will take place online this year due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Miss Symonds, who gave birth to the Prime Minster's son Wilfred in April retweeted a post by the group today, adding she rainbow emoji - a symbol of LGBT+ pride.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson's fiancée Carrie Symonds has revealed she will be judging a virtual lip sync battle hosted by the Conservatives LGBT+ wing. She is pictured outside Downing Street in May</p>

<p>Chair of the group Elena Bunbury replied saying she was 'so excited' that Miss Symonds was joining the event.</p>

<p>The event listing says it will see 'a host Tory Politicos attend' in the hope to wow the audience - and judge - with their lip syncing skills. </p>

<p>Lip Syncing has long been associating with the LGBT community and drag culture, and was popularised in the mainstream as a result of Emmy-award winning show Ru Paul's Drag Race.</p>

<p>The US show, which has spanned 12 seasons as well as dozens of spin-offs and international versions, sees drag queens 'lip sync for their lives' each week in order to remain in the competition.</p>

<p>The London-based conservationist, 32, said she was 'looking forward' to judging the event, which is part of party's conference, which will take place online this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>A separate TV show Lip Sync Battle, which sees celebrities compete against each other miming and dancing to songs, has become a viral hit too.</p>

<p>The show, which started as a segment on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, also inspired two UK series hosted by Mel B and Professor Green. </p>

<p>The Conservative Party conference was due to take place in Birmingham in October, but in July in a letter to members, the party's chair Amanda Milling said the gathering would be held online.</p>

<p>Carrie reportedly began an affair with Johnson while he was foreign secretary in 2018 while he was married to his second wife Marina Wheeler.</p>

<p>In May, she  announced the couple had become engaged and were expecting a baby. </p>

<p>Miss Symonds is living at Downing Street with the Prime Minister and their almost five-month-old son, Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas Johnson.</p>

<p>Carrie gave birth in London on April 29 with the Prime Minister at her side, days after he himself had been released from medical care following a lengthy battle with coronavirus.  </p>

<p>In a heart-warming Instagram post revealing the boy's name, Carrie said that the middle name Nicholas was a tribute to two NHS doctors, Dr Nick Price and Dr Nick Hart, who 'saved Boris' life last month' following his battle with coronavirus. </p>

<p>The first name is a tribute to the PM's paternal grandfather, Osman Wilfred Kemal, and Lawrie a reference to Carrie's grandfather. </p>

<p>Accompanying the caption was a photograph in which the first-time mother was seen tightly cradling her son, who sported an extraordinary full head of hair not dissimilar to that of his father.</p>
