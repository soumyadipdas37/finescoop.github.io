<p>'When you show up for a coffee/play date and realise you’ve both couple-dressed,' she captioned the picture. </p>

<p>In one photo Sylvia and her son Oscar, were matchy-matchy in an all grey ensemble, while Jayne and Joey both went nautical in blue and white stripes. </p>

<p>Both mum's flaunted their natural beauty with minimal makeup as they posed with their bubs. </p>

<p>Friends forever: In a second photo, Oscar (left) and Joey (right) appeared to be the best of mates as they were pictured laughing together in high chairs</p>

<p>This comes after Sylvia shared a sweet photo to Instagram of the six-month-old dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time on Monday.</p>

<p>In the hilarious picture, which was taken at Sydney's Bronte Beach, the child screwed up his nose and did not appear to be enjoying the milestone.</p>

<p>Not happy, mum! Sylvia has shared a photo of her son, Oscar, dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time at Bronte Beach. Oscar is pictured with his father, Peter Stefanovic</p>

<p> 'It was all fun and games until his toes touched the water,' Sylvia captioned the snap.</p>

<p>'Definitely a Queenslander,' she added, referencing the fact that both she and her husband, Peter Stefanovic, were born and raised in the Sunshine State.</p>

<p>In the image, Peter, 38, held on to Oscar reassuringly as he took his first dip in the ocean.</p>

<p>Much better: Peter later shared an image of Oscar looking much happier back on the sand as he cuddled up with his mother (Sylvia and Oscar pictured) </p>
