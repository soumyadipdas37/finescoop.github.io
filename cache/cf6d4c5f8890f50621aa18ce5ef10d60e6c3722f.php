<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ulrika Jonsson admitted she 'sobbed every night' when her son Cameron first went to university, as she shared a candid Instagram post on Thursday.</p>

<p>Sharing snaps of her 25-year-old, who she shares with ex-husband John Turnbull, she reflected on when he left home seven years earlier, and the TV presenter, 53, said she was 'not good at letting go'.</p>

<p>'I sobbed every night': Ulrika Jonsson admitted on Wednesday she 'mourned' when her eldest son Cameron first went to university and said she is 'not good at letting go'</p>

<p>'Couldn’t go in your room. Sobbed every night I laid the table for one less. Felt heartbroken; bereft.</p>

<p>'For all those parents going through the same right now: it does eventually get better. And then they come home penniless, hungover and qualified as plonkers (and in Goldenballs’ case, Film Director).</p>

<p>'But the changing shape of the family isn’t always an easy transition. 2 out of 4 of mine are gone.'</p>

<p>Looking back: Sharing snaps of her 25-year-old, who she shares with ex-husband John Turnbull, she reflected on when he left home seven years earlier</p>

<p>Struggle: In her emotional post about Cameron, she wrote: 'This day SEVEN years ago, I dropped you off at Uni. Drove home and mourned for 3 months'</p>

<p>She went on: 'now and my youngest wonders why I cling on to him for dear life when he walks to school every morning, dragging me along the ground, behind him....'</p>

<p>'I’m just not good at letting go of things I thought I owned but are apparently just on loan, ‘s all (sic).'</p>

<p>Her post comes after she praised her 'brilliant' daughter Martha for passing her GCSEs last month, after the government's U-turn meant results could be based on teachers' estimated grades following the cancellation of exams amid the pandemic. </p>

<p>The presenter, who shares the 16-year-old with businessman ex Lance Gerrard-Wright, was every inch the proud mother as she took to Instagram to upload a cheery image of the teen.</p>

<p>Joker: Ulrika added, 'For all those parents going through the same right now: it does eventually get better. And then they come home penniless, hungover and qualified as plonkers'</p>

<p>Honest: Ulrika went on, 'I’m just not good at letting go of things I thought I owned but are apparently just on loan, ‘s all'</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Martha Moo. So proud of you. (Except when you sleep til 3pm). But: GCSEs. You did it. In a messed up year with so many rites of passage snatched from you by C-19.'</p>

<p>Injecting a hint of her typical humour into the post, the media personality added: 'You have a brilliant mind. And you're stubborn. What else does a girl need?Maybe an alarm clock. </p>

<p>'Love you, darling girl. (Wishing all parents and students well today. What a palaver....)' (sic).</p>

<p>'Love you, darling girl': Her post comes after she praised her 'brilliant' daughter Martha for passing her GCSEs last month</p>

<p>Yay! The presenter who shares the 16-year-old with businessman ex Lance Gerrard-Wright, was every inch the proud mother as she took to Instagram to congratulate the teen</p>

<p>The results for GCSE students were released at the same time as revised A-level results which showed more than 10 per cent of A-level entries have been upgraded following a U-turn on the way results are awarded, with 38.1 per cent of students gaining an A or A* this year, compared to 27.6 per cent in 2019. </p>

<p>It was also announced that all A-Level students with the correct grades will get into their first choice of university, and caps on student numbers for medical degrees have been scrapped. </p>

<p>The surge comes after Education Secretary Gavin Williamson scrapped the controversial algorithm system for both A-levels and GCSEs following a mass outcry from students and parents - and conceded teachers' predicted grades must be used to mark pupils who could not sit their exams because of the pandemic. </p>

<p>The Swedish TV star also shares children Bo, 19, with hotel manager Marcus Kempen, and Malcolm, 12, with advertising executive Brian Monet. </p>

<p>Her biggest supporter: The former Gladiators host joked her daughter was 'stubborn' but made reference to her 'brilliant mind'</p>
