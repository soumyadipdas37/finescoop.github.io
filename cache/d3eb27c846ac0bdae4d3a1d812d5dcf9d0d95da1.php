<p>'It was a very unusual situation because I had never heard of the song before,' Silva said.</p>

<p>'This video of the lad Alex coming out of the crowd wearing my shirt, he got on stage and sang the song with all the other artists and it went viral.</p>

<p>'Of course, it arrived to me in Paris and I then got the opportunity to meet Alex and thank him because sometimes us footballers lose the idea of the influence and reach that we have.</p>

<p>'So I was really happy, it was pleasing that there's a song with my name. I remember that day well.'</p>
