<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wesfarmers CEO Rob Scott has criticised Daniel Andrews' lockdown extension and lack of consultation between the government and businesses.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old is the latest in a string of fed-up business owners and politicians to blast the Victorian Premier over his 'road map' out of COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

<p>Mr Scott claimed Mr Andrews' announcement would generate more ambivalence for businesses and workers and lead to further economic turmoil across the country. </p>

<p>'I worry that this latest ­announcement creates more ­uncertainty and hardship and will inflict a greater personal and economic cost, not just to the people of Melbourne but the whole of Australia,' Mr Scott told The Australian.</p>

<p>Wesfarmrs CEO Rob Scott (pictured) claimed extending lockdown would create uncertainty for businesses</p>

<p>Wesfarmers employs about 30,000 people in Bunnings, Kmart, Officeworks and Target stores in Victoria.</p>

<p>Staff at those outlets are feeling the pinch as all non-essential stores in Melbourne have been forced to close or operate with minimal workers due to coronavirus restrictions. </p>

<p>Mr Scott said the extension of lockdown would have an 'enormous, incalculable and growing toll personally for many people, financially and on their emotional wellbeing, and also for the economy'.</p>

<p>Despite being head of one of Australia's biggest companies, Mr Scott said he was unable to speak with the Victorian government to provide feedback to help develop their recovery strategy for businesses.</p>

<p>A Melbourne Bunnings warehouse employee counts the number of customers entering the store as part of the company's COVID-safe working model in May. Mr Scott said the government should have consulted with businesses to see how they have adapted to safely work during the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Mr Scott said government and businesses must work together to ensure the safest and most productive way of restarting their trade after the pandemic. </p>

<p>'To develop a better plan would require the Victorian government to engage in genuine consultation, to listen and learn about industries that are outside their expertise, including how businesses have evolved to be COVID-safe,' he said.</p>

<p>Premier Andrews on Sunday announced Melbourne will remain under coronavirus lockdown until at least October 26, with some restrictions to be eased from midnight next Sunday.</p>

<p>Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Paul Guerra said Mr Andrews' plan was a 'kick in the guts' for businesses across the state. </p>

<p>'Today we have been delivered a road to nowhere,' he said.</p>

<p>'This does not deliver for the thousands of businesses that are trying to keep this state going and trying to keep their doors open.</p>

<p>'We can't continue to let business and jobs be decimated on the way to controlling the spread of the virus. This has to end. Business needs hope.'</p>

<p>Mr Guerra said the COVID recovery plan wasn't good enough and would leave thousands of employees out of work. </p>

<p>'The heartbreak for members, and in fact business owners today is the realisation that many of them who have been desperately hanging on for months will see their businesses fold and they will have to look their employees in the eye and tell them that they no longer have a job,' he said.</p>

<p>'We need to get the virus under control. We are lock-step with both the federal and state governments on that aim. But we can't just let business and jobs be sacrificed on the way.'</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the lockdown extension 'crushing news for the people of Victoria' which will 'come at a further economic cost'.</p>

<p>Under Mr Andrews' road map out of lockdown, residents will have to wait until November 23 for all retail stores to reopen. </p>

<p>'We can't run out of lockdown. We have to take steady and safe steps out of lockdown to find that COVID normal,' Mr Andrews said on Sunday.</p>

<p>He stressed the importance of easing slowly into normal life to avoid a dreaded third wave. </p>

<p>'If we open up too fast then we have a very high likelihood that we are not really opening up at all,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>'We would all like to open up as quickly as possible. We would all like to find that COVID normal or go back to actual normal as soon as possible.</p>

<p>'But that is not the nature of this virus. It is wicked in many ways.' </p>
