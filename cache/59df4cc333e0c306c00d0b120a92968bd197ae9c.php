<p>The ring he received when he married Lisa 15 years ago had slipped off his finger when he was hit by the wave and he had not noticed.</p>

<p>His daughter's glasses were also sent flying by the wave, but those had been found by the family. </p>

<p>Before leaving the Isle of Wight Mr Eastley, from Paddock Wood in Kent, asked the owner of a cafe on the beach if they could keep a lookout for his ring on the off chance that it turned up.</p>

<p>He said that he had asked the cafe owner, expecting never to see it again and had already made plans to replace the band.  </p>

<p>Before leaving the Isle of Wight Mr Eastley, from Paddock Wood in Kent, asked the owner of a cafe on the beach if they could keep a lookout for his ring on the off chance that it turned up</p>

<p>However, less than 24 hours later, 11-year-old Priya Sahu, who attends King Edward VI secondary school in Southampton, Hampshire, discovered the ring washed up on the shore.</p>

<p>Priya said: 'I was looking under sand for sea shells and then I saw something shiny in the ground and I thought "ooh, what's this?"</p>

<p>'So I picked it up and said "mummy I've found a ring" and then she really wasn't that interested at all, she said it was probably just a fake ring.'</p>

<p>Together with her mother, Priya worked to locate Mr Eastley in order to return his ring.</p>

<p>Priya's mother, artist Aswita Sahu, from Southampton, said: 'Priya said it would be magical if we could actually find this person.' </p>

<p>Priya and her mother returned the ring to Mr Eastley in Watts Park, Southampton, on Sunday</p>

<p>By contacting a series of friends, the mother and daughter got in touch with the cafe owner who then directed them on to Mr Eastley. </p>

<p>Toni from Toni's Tea Rooms rang Mr Eastley to say: 'You're not going to believe it, but someone's found a ring.'</p>

<p>Mr Eastley described the phone call as a 'one in a million' event. </p>

<p>Mrs Sahu rang Mr Eastley and asked him to measure his finger size to make sure that the ring belonged to him.</p>

<p>Mr Eastley had his fingers measured and sent pictures of the ring to Aswita, who then arranged a date for them to meet.</p>

<p>Priya and her mother returned the ring to Mr Eastley in Watts Park, Southampton, on Sunday.</p>

<p>He described the return of his ring as a 'glass slipper in Cinderella' moment and that the ring had been irreplaceable.</p>

<p>Mr Eastley said: 'It's been a bit of a grim 2020 but [the find has] certainly put a smile on my face.' </p>
