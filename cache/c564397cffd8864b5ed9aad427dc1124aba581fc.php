<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dean Henderson could finally make his Manchester United debut in Tuesday's Carabao Cup visit to Luton as boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer plans wholesale changes to his side.</p>

<p>Rising star Henderson joined United's academy as a 14-year-old in 2011 and his prolonged push for a starting berth has been strengthened by first-choice goalkeeper David de Gea's erratic form.</p>

<p>Solskjaer saw De Gea and his teammates make a disastrous start to the Premier League season as they lost 3-1 at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday.  </p>

<p>United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will ring changes for the EFL Cup trip to Championship Luton</p>

<p>Henderson was on the bench for the defeat and could be drafted in for the third-round clash at Kenilworth Road following his impressive form on loan to Sheffield United for the past two seasons.</p>

<p>Solskjaer admitted: 'We'll make some changes – of course we will. For some, it's the pre-season and, for some, they've only been here for a week now, for different reasons.</p>

<p>'Some of them need game time. They do and we can see we're lacking in sharpness. [We have] no fresh injuries after that [Palace] game but, as I said, we'll rotate and give some minutes.'</p>

<p>Henderson has also been loaned to Stockport, Grimsby and Shrewsbury during his apprenticeship at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>Established number one David de Gea was criticised again after the 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace</p>

<p>He earned his first senior England call up in October 2019 as a result of his impressive form for the Blades, although he is yet to make his full international debut.</p>

<p>Solskjaer said that some of his squad will remain in Manchester to hone their fitness ahead of the Premier League trip to Brighton on Saturday.</p>

<p>He said: 'We need four or five games to get up to the standard we know we're capable of.</p>

<p>'We haven't had an opportunity to get those games in and we have to make sure, in these games, we get the minutes and make the players ready to start competing in the league again.</p>

<p>De Gea has struggled while Henderson's stock has risen after impressing at Sheffield United</p>

<p>'Brighton away is going to be a very tough one so we'll use this one. We want to get through, but it's also minutes for a few.'</p>

<p>Luton are third in the Sky Bet Championship after back-to-back wins against Barnsley and Derby and have beaten recently-relegated Norwich and table-topping Reading in the Carabao Cup.</p>

<p>Accepting the threat posed by Nathan Jones' team, Solskjaer warned: 'It's a team with confidence and they're playing Man United. Of course it will be a big game for them.</p>

<p>'But it's a big game for our players, the ones who get a chance, as they need to show they are ready to be called upon.'</p>

<p>Solskjaer has claimed his squad are some way short of full fitness after an unusual pre-season</p>
