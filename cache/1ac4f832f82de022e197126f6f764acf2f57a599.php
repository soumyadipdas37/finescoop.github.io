<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>'I haven't just been telling jokes for the last 20 years!' says Betis winger Joaquin Sanchez from the other side of the Zoom screen.</p>

<p>It's his response to the suggestion that never losing his sense of fun, and the infectious smile that no one, apart from maybe Ronald Koeman, has ever managed to wipe off his face, has prevented people from seeing the great player behind the grin.</p>

<p>Still crazy after all these years? Yes maybe, but a brilliant footballer too.</p>

<p>Copa del Rey x2</p>

<p>LaLiga Breakthrough Player of the Year, 2002</p>

<p>The winger who stood-up Jose Mourinho in a Seville hotel when the Chelsea manager was trying to sign him in 2005, is still wearing his training kit because of LaLiga's pandemic protocol that means all players must change at home.</p>

<p>It's the build-up to Saturday's visit to Real Madrid where at the grand old age of 39, he'll play his LaLiga match number 825, no outfield players has played more in Spain.</p>

<p>He smiles back at almost every question, but especially broadly, when Sportsmail asks: Did he actually talk to Mourinho about the Chelsea move?</p>

<p>'Well in the meeting I didn't because I never turned up!' he laughs.</p>

<p>'They were all at the Alfonso XIII hotel and I was coming back from a publicity thing in Madrid and I didn't want to go to the meeting. I knew if I went, I would end up going to England. So I didn't go.</p>

<p>'I spoke to Mourinho later and apologised. And afterwards he thanked me. He said: "I appreciate you being honest because, well, you are the first footballer that has said no to me".'</p>

<p>At the time he was a 23-year-old sensation for Betis and Spain. The former were a Champions League outfit and the latter building towards their greatest period.</p>

<p>'Lopera said to me that I had to leave, because they had reached an agreement,' says Joaquin, remembering Betis' then-president Manuel Ruiz de Lopera's negotiations with Roman Abramovich for a sale of around €37million (£33.6m - a Betis record at the time).</p>

<p>'It had all happened very quickly for me. I was 20-years-old when I played in the World Cup in 2002. I remember having a lot of stress because it was not easy to take it all on board.</p>

<p>'When the moment of truth came, I didn't want to take that step of going to another team. I just didn't see myself leaving home.</p>

<p>Joaquin impressed in the 2002 World Cup and caught the attention of Europe's biggest clubs</p>

<p>He once stood-up Jose Mourinho to avoid a transfer to Chelsea in the summer of 2005</p>

<p>'The president would say: "Here comes the Russian again with an offer behind his back". But I was happy where I was.</p>

<p>'People always say to me: "Joaquin, don't you regret it?"</p>

<p>'Well the answer is no, I don't. I know I lost an important opportunity to play for a great team and earn a lot of money but it just wasn't what I was thinking about at that time.' </p>

<p>Do young players these days forget too easily, that despite all the pressure, they can still decide to stay put if they want to?</p>

<p>'Yes, and also they are so young when they have to take those decisions,' Joaquin says. 'In the end this is such big business that the word of the player doesn't always count for much. And sometimes he goes even though he knows that he is not going to be an important player [at the new club].</p>

<p>'It's true that when you get an offer from a powerful club it's difficult to turn them down but sometimes we forget the most important thing, which is to play.' </p>

<p>He continued to impress but a move to Real failed in 2006 because Betis wanted too much</p>

<p>He signed for Valencia and played for Quique Sanchez Flores, Ronald Koeman and Unai Emery</p>

<p>In the summer of 2006 it did feel like time to move away from Betis. Real Madrid came calling but president Lopera asked for too much and in the end it was Valencia who bought him for €25m (£22m). There he played for Quique Sanchez Flores, Koeman and Unai Emery.</p>

<p>'The first period was not easy at the start,' he says. 'Quique was a coach who demanded a lot physically. I ended up playing and it was very good. Quique was a very important coach for me.'</p>

<p>Before he goes on to the next manager there is a pause and a scratch of the chin. 'Pfff! I'm not even going to name [the coach],' he says.</p>

<p>'Genuinely, he didn't do anything for me. You know very well how all that ended up. But these are things that you have to go through. I learnt from that but it wasn't good.'</p>

<p>Current Barcelona coach Koeman fell out with most of Valencia's players in his six-month spell at the club and he left Joaquin on the bench as an unused substitute for the Copa del Rey final victory that came just before he got the sack.</p>

<p>'I had a tough time during that period. I was in that dressing room where there were players who had been excluded from the rest of the squad. Every morning there was a really tense situation.</p>

<p>'When you get up and you have no desire to go into the dressing room, that says it all, it was really screwed up.'</p>

<p>Joaquin didn't have the best relationship with the new Barcelona manager at the Mestalla</p>

<p>He raises his shoulders as if a weight is lifted when he talks about his last Valencia coach. Emery was heavy going at times but in a more digestible way than Koeman.</p>

<p>He laughs at being reminded of once saying that Emery's video sessions were so long, he would 'run-out of popcorn'.</p>

<p>'It was a good time,' he says. 'He came with lots of enthusiasm and brought important changes. Tactically, he was one of the best-prepared coaches.</p>

<p>'But he was so intense that he made your head explode sometimes. And the videos thing, it's true. I think he's improved: I think the clips are more normal [length] now.'</p>

<p>When he left Valencia in 2011 for Manuel Pellegrini's Malaga they finished fourth in his first season and were harshly knocked out the Champions League by Jurgen Klopp's Borussia Dortmund at the quarter-final stage the following year.</p>

<p>Two offside goals in injury time gave the German team a 3-2 aggregate victory.</p>

<p>Joaquin had been outstanding scoring one and assisting the other before being taken off late on. </p>

<p>'If VAR had existed then we would have been in semi-finals,' he says. 'I went off in the 86th minute and I was in the semi-final. I sat down and what happened, happened.</p>

<p>Joaquin was in the Malaga team that were unfortunate to miss out on the Champions League semi-finals in 2013</p>

<p>'We came back [to the hotel] and it was so sad but when we got to Malaga, all that was taken away. It was as if we had won the Champions League.</p>

<p>'My hairs still stand on end when I remember it because the whole city was at the airport.'</p>

<p>Missing out on a European Cup semi-final is tough to take; so is missing out international honours.</p>

<p>The last of his 51 games for Spain came in November 2007 as they finished the job of qualifying for Euro 2008.</p>

<p>He watched from home as they lifted the trophy and won the World Cup and another Euros.</p>

<p>Everyone loved Joaquin for his open-book sincerity. But an interview in which he described the Spain team as a 'mess and a chaos' in 2006 was too candid.</p>

<p>He was right at the time but as things improved he got pushed out and was never welcomed back in.</p>

<p>'The way I am hasn't always done me any favours,' he says. 'But it shouldn't be like that. You have to judge me as a footballer.</p>

<p>'It's years ago now since I stopped thinking about it and it's also true that there has been a great national team and great players and its normal that they didn't have me down as a main option.' </p>

<p>Joaquin was not picked for Euro 2008 and watched Spain win the tournament from home</p>

<p>Could he bear to watch the 2008 final having been dropped from the squad right at the end of qualifying?</p>

<p>'I enjoyed it as much as anyone, and I was happy,' he says.</p>

<p>'Team mates called me and congratulated me, and I felt part of it. It was hard that I didn't get to experience it in person. It was unfair.</p>

<p>'At that time, I think Luis Aragones was very, very, very, very unfair with me. I have thought about it, dreamed about it, lots of times – and he knows that. I don't know where he is now, but wherever he is, he knows that.'</p>

<p>Joaquin has given football fans so much to smile about over the years. It would have been nice if he had been part of those historic tournament wins.</p>

<p>From the admission: 'My Mum breast-fed me until I was six or seven. The doctor says that's why I'm so strong,' to the joke he told at his Malaga presentation about a widow watching the team in the Champions League final with an empty seat beside her and being asked why no relative could have taken her late husband's ticket ('they are all at the funeral' being the punchline) Joaquin has kept supporters entertained with and without the ball at his feet. </p>

<p>He'll have more than enough memories to make up for some of the trophies his contemporaries have won. Even if there will be a few swapped shirts missing after thieves made a dent in a collection of over 800 his wife has encouraged him to make for when he retires.</p>

<p>Joaquin is still an important player for Betis, 20 years since he made his debut for the club</p>

<p>'They took David's [Beckham's], Ronaldo's, [Frank] Lampard's. They never touched the telly or the DVD, just the shirts,' he says.</p>

<p>Retirement is still not imminent though. Back at Betis and back playing for Pellegrini, he'll be 40 next July, how much longer can he go on?</p>

<p>'When you get to thirty-something, every year you think: let's see this year,' he laughs. 'But physically I'm in good shape.</p>

<p>'If I can do another year after this one, if my body can take it and they want me to, then you won't be able to drag me away!'</p>

<p>Does it feel like 20 years since he made his debut? 'No, it feels like yesterday,' he says.</p>

<p>'In the end I think my career has been down to always trying to be a guy who doesn't lose that enthusiasm, coming to training with plenty of hunger and desire to be professional, and of course that is the case now more than ever with the passing of the years.</p>

<p>'I'm never going to stop enjoying it because that's just the way I am.'</p>
