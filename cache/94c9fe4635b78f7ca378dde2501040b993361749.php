<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman watched in disgust as security escorted a mentally ill man from a hospital ward and left him on the side of the road just a day after he was admitted with hypothermia.</p>

<p>The man was still wearing his hospital gown when he was left out the front of Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital on Sunday.  </p>

<p>He had been found a day earlier naked and in a swampy creek, suffering from hypothermia, the Courier-Mail reported. </p>

<p>A woman was 'disgusted' when she watched security escort a mentally ill man from a hospital ward and leave him on the side of the road a day after he was admitted with hypothermia</p>

<p>Mother-of-three Hayley Birtles-Eades told the publication she was 'horrified' when she watched the man as he was 'frogmarched' out of the hospital.</p>

<p>'Protective services marched a mentally unwell and clearly unstable man out of the hospital... What the actual f**k is going on with the world?' she posted on Facebook after the incident.  </p>

<p>'This man is clearly unable to take care of himself, he’s a danger to himself and to the public, tossing him out on to a main road is NOT duty of care.'</p>

<p>Ms Birtles-Eades went on to say that the man should have been sedated and put in a psychiatric ward if that was what he needed, but that 'tossing him outside wearing only a hospital gown and a nappy' wasn't the answer.  </p>

<p>'I am shocked and horrified with what I just witnessed.'   </p>

<p> Ms Birtles-Eades recorded part of the ordeal.</p>

<p>The man was still wearing his hospital gown when he was left out the front of Royal Brisbane and Women's hospital on Sunday</p>

<p>Ms Birtles-Eades called an ambulance when she noticed the man had been left outside the hospital</p>

<p>In the footage, the man can be heard moaning and whining as he is forcibly dragged from the premises.  </p>

<p>'You've been discharged – let's go, come on… you're going... off,' one guard says.</p>

<p>The mother-of-three was in the emergency room waiting for her husband to receive treatment for a suspected stroke. </p>

<p>She was asked to stop filming the incident and was told it was 'illegal', but Ms Birtles-Eades said that was the least of her concerns. </p>

<p>'The hospital can fix broken bones, but if you've got a broken brain, you're stuffed,' she said.</p>

<p>'How many times does a person have to ask for help before they get it? How bad do you have to be – dead?'</p>

<p>Ms Birtles-Eades called an ambulance when she noticed the man had been left outside the hospital.</p>

<p>The Queensland Ambulance Service transported him right back to the same hospital emergency room. </p>

<p>A Queensland Health spokesman told the Courier-Mail that staff gave the man a gown as he arrived naked and said that the man's GP was contacted before he was discharged. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Queensland Health for comment. </p>
