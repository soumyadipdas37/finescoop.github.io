<p>He told Inside United magazine: 'I watched United a lot [when I was younger]. Because a lot of Dutch players have played here and this was nice to watch if you're a young kid and you see Dutch players there.</p>

<p>'Daley, Edwin, Robin van Persie... you see them. They won a lot of titles and United always played nice football, which was always good to see.'</p>

<p>Goalkeeper Van der Sar was United's No 1 between 2005 and 2011, helping the team win four Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2008.</p>

<p>Edwin van der Sar was United's goalkeeper for six seasons between 2005 and 2011</p>

<p>Midfielder Daley Blind made 141 appearances for the club over the course of four seasons</p>

<p>Striker Van Persie joined the Old Trafford club ahead of Sir Alex Ferguson's final season as manager and scored 26 goals as they won the Premier League.</p>

<p>Midfielder Blind arrived during Dutch manager Louis van Gaal's tenure - also from Ajax - and made 141 appearances for the club over four seasons.</p>

<p>He added: 'Old Trafford is an amazing stadium. The nicest thing will be when the fans are there too and I cannot wait to play for the first time in front of them.</p>

<p>'I hope to see them soon in the stadium because for our team they will give us a lot of power when we can have them with us.</p>

<p>'It's a family club, I feel this already from the first seconds I have been here.'</p>
