<p>The owner of the Park Mansion on East 82nd Street (pictured) says Libbieowes at least $148,450 from April</p>

<p>A source close to Libbie, who recently finalised an acrimonious divorce that was branded New York City's 'nastiest' split, said her ex-husband stopped paying her bills.</p>

<p>It is not known if David, 48, who shares two children with Libbie, was required to pay the rent since he filed for divorce in 2018.</p>

<p>The source said: 'The rent has not been paid. No one disputes this. </p>

<p>'But thanks to Gov. Cuomo, there's also a government moratorium on evictions that plays into this.'</p>

<p>The couple is seen above in New York City in April. They had been married for 14 years before his split</p>

<p>In August, the couple settled their divorce after Libbie demanded $100million, according to Avenue.</p>

<p>The pair were fighting over a $72million Manhattan townhouse, his family's art collection estimated to be worth $5billion and their Hamptons home. </p>

<p>Libbie is now said to be dating former Mighty Ducks actor turned blockchain entrepreneur and independent presidential candidate Brock Pierce.</p>

<p>She previously accused a houseguest of sleeping with her husband after the woman, David, and five other guests went skinny-dipping in the pool following a dinner party on the Fourth of July weekend in 2018.</p>

<p>She claimed she walked in at 6am the next morning to find her husband lying naked and asleep on top of an attractive brunette beneath a painting from Richard Prince's 'After Dark' series.</p>

<p>The houseguest, who has not been named but knew the Mugrabis from the world of art, said: 'It was fun. It was nothing sexual. As if we were teenagers.'</p>

<p>Libbie also accused David of physically assaulting her when he caught her trying to move a $500,000 Keith Haring sculpture out of their home.</p>

<p>At one point in court, proceedings became so heated that Libbie's attorney shouted at David: 'Cuff him and take him down to The Tombs!' </p>

<p>A source said after the divorce was settled: 'She asked for a hundred million, and she's happy with the deal she got.</p>

<p>'It includes art, real estate, alimony and child support. All the goodies.' </p>
