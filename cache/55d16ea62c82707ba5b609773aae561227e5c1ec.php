<p>When live radio goes terribly wrong: KIIS FM's Kyle Sandilands and Jackie 'O' Henderson (pictured) were left speechless on Thursday after a listener named Ahmed tried to win back his ex-wife Sally </p>

<p>Ahmed revealed Sally had dumped him last year because he'd failed to show her enough affection during their three-year marriage. </p>

<p>'She felt like I never loved her that much,' he said, adding: 'Whatever happens after today, it's just a closure for me. I've got a lot of guilt inside of me and I just want to make her understand I am guilty.' </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ahmed's dreams turned into a nightmare when Sally brutally rejected him on live radio.    </p>

<p>'Why would I get back together with a manipulative, lying [expletive]?' While Ahmed was confident he would be able to woo his former flame, Sally made it abundantly clear she wasn't interested </p>

<p>'I'm so sorry but I'm not with you... actually I'm not sorry,' Sally snapped. </p>

<p>'You're not sorry at all?' replied Ahmed.</p>

<p>'No, I'm not. Why would I get back together with a manipulative, lying [expletive]? Did you really think you'd get me back through this?' she raged. </p>

<p>'Figure out your sexuality first, then let me know whether you're straight or gay': The confrontation devolved further when Sally questioned Ahmed's sexuality</p>

<p>'Figure out your sexuality first, then let me know whether you're straight or gay,' she fumed.</p>

<p>Jackie was lost for words, while Kyle managed to awkwardly mutter: 'Oh oh...'</p>

<p>Sally proceeded to take yet another stab at Ahmed, declaring that she would 'rather be single for the rest of her life' than get back with such a 'toxic' person. </p>

<p>Making it clear her answer to Ahmed's romantic proposal was a resounding 'no', Sally added: 'He's a very toxic person. I spent three and a half years of my marriage living with him and I won't do that to myself again.; </p>

<p>Speechless: Jackie was lost for words, while Kyle managed to awkwardly mutter: 'Oh oh...'</p>
