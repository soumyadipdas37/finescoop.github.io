<p>Jordan Henderson's long ball caught out the Chelsea defence with Christensen bundling Mane to the ground before he could knock the ball past the on-rushing Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>

<p>Referee Paul Tierney originally gave the Blues' defender a yellow card but that was upgraded to a red after the official was advised to check the pitch-side monitor by VAR.</p>

<p>Andreas Christensen has been sent off against Liverpool after bringing down Sadio Mane</p>

<p>Paul Tierney used the pitch-side monitor to review his original decision of a yellow card</p>

<p>Christensen was not helped by his goalkeeper who came rushing out to try and meet the pass from Henderson, and with Mane's pace taking him away from the Dane, he was left with no choice but to bring him down.</p>

<p>Sky Sports pundits Jamie Redknapp and Ashley Cole were in agreement that the foul was a red card offence and Redknapp praised the use of VAR's pitch-side monitor.</p>

<p>'I think this is what fans have been wanting to see for ages,' said the pundit.</p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga was left in no man's land after rushing out to try and meet the long pass</p>

<p>'We've got the pitch-side monitor so it's there to be used. It's the right decision, it's definitely a red card.</p>

<p>'The run is perfect and he pulls into Christensen's blind spot. The pass is sensational. Mane makes that run from out in so well and it's a definite red card.' </p>

<p>Frank Lampard's 10-men now face an uphill battle in the second half and the Blues' boss has opted to bring on Fikayo Tomori to bolster his defence.</p>

<p>Christen is the first player to be sent off in a Premier League fixture between Chelsea and Liverpool since his manager saw red in 2009. </p>
