<p>A source told E! News in an article Wednesday that Kaia and Jacob have been friends for some time.</p>

<p>'Jacob definitely has interest in dating Kaia, but there is nothing serious going on there,' the insider said.</p>

<p>'They have many mutual friends and have hung out many times in the past. They both have very chill personalities and similar interests. Jacob makes Kaia laugh and her family adores him'.</p>

<p>Kaia has been keeping it friendly but they do flirt with each other, the source said, while adding, 'She has told friends she is single and is only having fun and hanging out with people'.</p>
