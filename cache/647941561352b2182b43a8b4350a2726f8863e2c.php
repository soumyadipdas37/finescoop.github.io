<p>Cat out of the bag? There have been increasing clues that Bella Varelis doesn't win Locky Gilbert's heart. And on former The Bachelor star Laura Byrne (pictured) has added fuel to the fire with a caring comment which seems to imply Bella could use some support</p>

<p>Laura replied tellingly: 'Thinking of you honey'. </p>

<p>Bachiefunny explained in their caption: '13 weeks ago... around filming time... And before anyone of us knew Bella and would have noticed this. </p>

<p>'Does Laura's response make you think it's all going to end in heartbreak for Bella? Or completely unrelated to Bachie?'    </p>

<p>It comes after eagle-eyed Bachelor fans noticed another telling clue that Bella doesn't win.</p>

<p>Heartbroken? Spotted by the Instagram account Bachiefunny, and showed Bella (pictured) wishing Laura's daughter Marlie-Mae a happy first birthday, on an Instagram post shared 13 weeks ago, around the time of filming for the show</p>

<p>As reported by New Idea, viewers have observed that one particular detail seals a contestant's fate even before the first episode has aired.</p>

<p>As a general rule, when a woman is the very first to be introduced to the public - either in trailers or via social media - she ends up being the heartbroken runner-up.</p>

<p>Every year, Channel 10 introduces viewers to the contestants one by one or in batches, and the first to be shown usually goes far in the competition.</p>

<p>But crucially they never actually win the Bachelor's heart. </p>

<p>Is her fate sealed? It comes after eagle-eyed Bachelor fans have noticed a telling clue that strongly suggests Bella doesn't win Locky Gilbert's (right) heart</p>

<p>Theory: As a general rule, when a woman is the very first to be introduced to the public - either in trailers or via social media - she ends up being the heartbroken runner-up. On July 25, several weeks before the season premiere, Bella was among four bachelorettes introduced on The Bachelor's official Instagram account (pictured)</p>

<p>Doomed from the start? That same month, She was also the first woman to have a dedicated promo showing her red carpet entrance</p>

<p>Third-place contestant Tara Pavlovic the first to be shown in promos during Matty Johnson's season in 2017.</p>

<p>The same was true for Brooke Blurton from Nick Cummins' season in 2018. She chose to leave before the finale, meaning she effectively placed third.</p>

<p>And who was the first of Locky's ladies to be introduced this year? Bella Varelis.</p>

<p>On July 25, several weeks before the season premiere, Bella was among four bachelorettes introduced via The Bachelor's official Instagram account.</p>

<p>Notably, her photo was the first image in the slideshow. </p>

<p>Pattern: Every year, Channel 10 introduces viewers to the contestants one by one or in batches, and the first to be shown usually goes far in the competition - but crucially they never actually win the Bachelor's heart. Pictured: Locky's top four (L-R) Izzy Sharman-Firth, Irena Srbinovska, Bec Cvilikas and Bella Varelis</p>

<p>That same month, She was also the first woman to have a dedicated promo showing her red carpet entrance.</p>

<p>She was shown stepping out of the limousine and strolling over to Locky, who was almost speechless and said: 'Sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.'</p>

<p>According to Sportsbet, Irena Srbinovska is the bookies' favourite to win as of Tuesday afternoon with odds of $1.30, while Bella is tipped for runner-up at $3.50.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>

<p>Other examples: Third-place contestant Tara Pavlovic (left) was also the first to be shown in promos during Matty J's season in 2017. The same was true for Brooke Blurton (right) from Nick Cummins' season in 2018; she chose to leave before the finale, meaning she placed third</p>
