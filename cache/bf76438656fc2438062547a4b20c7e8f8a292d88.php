<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea may have to pay goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga £5million to sit on the bench because they cannot find a club willing to sign him, according to The Sun.  </p>

<p>The Spaniard who cost an eye-watering £72m when he joined from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, has been relegated to the substitutes' bench following a series of high-profile errors.  </p>

<p>Kepa's alarming form forced the club to sign Edouard Mendy and appoint the Senegalese stopper as their new No 1. </p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga faces a season on the bench after a series of high-profile errors for Chelsea</p>

<p>Chelsea signed Senegalese goalkeeper Edouard Mendy from French side Rennes for £22m</p>

<p>It is believed Chelsea would want as much as £60m to sell the world's most expensive goalkeeper, but with no takers the west Londoners are looking to find a club interested in taking him on loan.  </p>

<p>Any club looking to secure Kepa on a temporary basis would be unlikely to pay his £150,000-a-week wages, meaning the Blues would need to subsidise at least half of that.</p>

<p>However with limited interest it is looking increasingly likely that Kepa will remain on the payroll at Stamford Bridge, costing the west London outfit around £5m to be Mendy's understudy for the season. </p>

<p>Kepa's latest goalkeeping error against Liverpool led to Mane's second goal of the game</p>

<p>Chelsea are desperately attempting to offload squad players before the transfer window closes, with Antonio Rudiger and Marcos Alonso both being linked with moves away from the club.</p>

<p>Jorginho and Tiemoue Bakayoko could also be on their way out, while Inter Milan are keen on signing N'Golo Kante.</p>

<p>Ruben-Loftus Cheek is also being linked with a season-long loan move to West Ham. </p>

<p>One player who has left the Bridge is Ross Barkley, the England international has completed a season-long loan to Aston Villa.</p>
