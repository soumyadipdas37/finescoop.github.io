<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea outcast Danny Drinkwater has tried to find the positives in his ongoing exile at Stamford Bridge, with the midfielder hoping to find a new club before the transfer window closes.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old has been surplus to requirements at Chelsea for a number of seasons now and is set for the exit once again this summer.</p>

<p>Danny Drinkwater has been told to find a new club by Chelsea before the window closes </p>

<p>And while the uncertainty of finding a new club will be stressful for the player, Drinkwater is determined to find a rosier outlook on things.</p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Drinkwater posted a picture of himself back at training with the Blues, along with the caption: 'Hmmm “Being challenged in life is inevitable, being defeated is optional...” </p>

<p>'Back at <?php echo e('@'); ?>chelseafc only for pre season... working hard, trying to get fit and be in the best shape I can be for wherever I go next. As much as I would love to be settled at a club like I should be, the unknown is kinda exciting.'</p>

<p>Drinkwater spent the first half of last season on loan at Burnley but failed to impress</p>

<p>Drinkwater faces a fight to rebuild his career after winning the Premier League title in 2016 and joining Chelsea for £35m in September 2017, but injuries and lack of trust from managers meant he made only 19 appearances in two years at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>He spent the first half of last season on loan at Burnley but played only twice before being sent on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of the campaign, where he made four appearances.</p>

<p>Drinkwater has two more years left on his current Chelsea deal. </p>
