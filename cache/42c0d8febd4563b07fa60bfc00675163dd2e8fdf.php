<p>After three and a half years in office, she shared that she is most proud of the measures the Trump administration has taken against addiction.   </p>

<p>Melania was born Melanija Knavs in 1970 and grew up in the Slovenian industrial town of Sevnica. </p>

<p>Her father, Viktor Knavs, was a car dealer, and her mother, Amalija Knavs, was a designer for children's clothing.</p>

<p>Looking back: Melania recalled how her husband announced on the Larry King Live show in 1999 that he was considering running for office, but it wasn't the right time </p>

<p>Confident: Melania, pictured at President Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017, said she knew that 'if and when he ran, he would win'</p>

<p>Role of a lifetime: Melania said her childhood in Slovenia, her life as an international model, and her time in New York has let to her 'serving our great nation as First Lady'</p>

<p>Melania started modeling when she was 16, and by the time she was 18, she was signed with an agency in Milan, Italy. She worked in both Milan and Paris before she moved to New York in 1996. </p>

<p>She met her future husband at a fashion party in 1998, and they married in a lavish ceremony in Palm Beach, Florida, in 2005. A year later, they welcomed their only child together, Barron, who is now 14. </p>

<p>Melania told Tatler that her childhood and subsequent years living across Europe had prepared her for where she is now. </p>

<p>'Growing up in Slovenia, living in both Milan and Paris at a young age, then moving to the United States and living in New York City in my 20s — all of that has led to my serving our great nation as First Lady,' she said. </p>

<p>Melania is the first First Lady to be a naturalized citizen as well as the first whose native language is not English.   </p>

<p>When asked how her life experiences had shaped her, she said: 'I can tell you that I believe in free-market capitalism.' </p>

<p>Melania's interview is promoted on the cover of the magazine with the headline: 'The final days of the First Lady? Melania talks to Tatler.' </p>

<p>While she rarely does in-depth interviews, she does not star on the cover of the November issue. That honor has gone to another internationally recognized woman from a powerful family: Meghan Markle. </p>
