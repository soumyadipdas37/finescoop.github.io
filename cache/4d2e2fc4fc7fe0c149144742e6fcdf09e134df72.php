<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea have been handed a huge boost in their pursuit of Bayer Leverkusen star Kai Havertz after his manager confirmed he has had his final training session at the club.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard's side have held a long-standing interest in the 21-year-old and the £90million move looks to be edging closer. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately, our squad has not yet been determined,' Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz said on Monday.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz arrived for Germany duty on Monday ahead of the Nations League</p>

<p>Bayer Leverkusen boss Peter Bosz confirmed that Havertz has trained for the last time at club</p>

<p>'I don't expect Kevin Volland and Kai Havertz to train with us again.</p>

<p>'It is possible that other players will also change. We definitely need to bring in players.'</p>

<p>Havertz checked in for international duty with Germany on Monday ahead of UEFA Nations League clashes against Spain and Switzerland this week.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard's Chelsea have held a long-standing interest in the 21-year-old midfielder</p>

<p>Lampard is continuing to rebuild his Blues side this summer after finishing fourth in his debut season in charge.</p>

<p>Havertz's fellow Germany team-mate Timo Werner made the switch from RB Leipzig to Stamford Bridge for £53m, following £38m Hakim Ziyech through the door.</p>

<p>The Blues recently added Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell to their growing list of new signings with the England international completing a £50m switch last week.</p>

<p>They also bolstered their options at the back with the signings of Paris Saint-Germain defender Thiago Silva on a free transfer and French defender Malang Sarr.</p>

<p>Havertz could be joining his fellow Germany team-mate Timo Werner at Stamford Bridge</p>
