<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gary Neville believes that Manchester United talisman Bruno Fernandes will return fit and firing again next season.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old playmaker was widely hailed as the turning point behind United's improved form after his January arrival from Sporting Lisbon, and his eight league goals helped haul the team into the top four.</p>

<p>Despite Fernandes appearing visibly tired towards the back end of a testing campaign, Neville has insisted that his former club's main man will avoid a dip in form. </p>

<p>Gary Neville has backed Manchester United star Bruno Fernandes to continue his lethal form</p>

<p>The Sky Sports pundit also insisted Fernandes will shake off any tiredness from last season</p>

<p>'Bruno Fernandes was shattered by the end of the season,' he told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'In the last few games he looked absolutely spent, but the expectation, what he'd done since he'd come in, he played in every single game, even the game at Norwich in the FA Cup, which was just bizarre at the time. </p>

<p>'I think Ole had a thing with him where he thought he'd just keep him going.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old playmaker was a key factor behind United sealing a Champions League spot</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer relied heavily on Fernandes' goals during United's late-season games</p>

<p>'He was on a roll, he's fit, he can run, he's so energetic and when he's in the team we win.</p>

<p>'But there definitely was that dip towards the end where he looked like he needed that rest. Hopefully, he's had that rest now and he's ready to go again.  </p>

<p>'His attitude doesn't tell me, and when you watch him, his performances don't tell me that there's going to be a dip because he just looks like he's got that belief in himself and the courage to take the ball. </p>

<p>'Even if he has a difficult start to the season he'll not lose that belief to get on the ball and go and find space, try and play the pass that is difficult and try and play the ball forward.</p>

<p>Neville believes the superb introduction of Fernandes has helped improve his team-mates</p>

<p>'That's the big thing for me, he always looks for a pass forward to try and unlock a team. He's enabled the front three to become a lot better.'</p>

<p>Fernandes netted 12 goals and recorded eight assists in all competitions after his £68million signing, and has proven a revelation after United wrapped up their third-placed finish and a Champions League spot. </p>

<p>The Old Trafford outfit begin the new league season by welcoming Crystal Palace on September 19. </p>
