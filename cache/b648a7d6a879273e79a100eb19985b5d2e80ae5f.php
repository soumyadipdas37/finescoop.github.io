<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel Andrews has said he will speed up Victoria's road map out of lockdown if coronavirus case numbers fall faster than expected.</p>

<p>Under the premier's plan, released on Sunday, lockdown will only end when there are an average of five cases per day, which is not expected until October 26. </p>

<p>Until then, a curfew will be in place from 9pm to 5am and residents can only leave home for exercise, shopping, school and work, and caregiving. </p>

<p>Daniel Andrews has said he will speed up Victoria's road map out of lockdown if coronavirus case numbers fall faster than expected</p>

<p>Police are seen along Elizabeth Street on Sunday as Premier Andrews released his roadmap</p>

<p>Mr Andrews has been slammed by businesses and opposition politicians who say such low numbers as a threshold for easing restrictions was unrealistic.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, the premier said he is open to changing the plan. </p>

<p>'If we saw things change dramatically then we would obviously remodel the whole thing,' he told Melbourne radio station 3AW.</p>

<p>'If the data was to fundamentally change then we would be standing up making different announcements.' </p>

<p>Mr Andrews also said he was not trying to eliminate the virus but suppress it enough  that contact tracing teams can identify and isolate the contacts of every case. </p>

<p>He said after lockdown is lifted there will be cases but they would not necessarily mean a return to harsh restrictions, saying the state was not pursuing unrealistic eradication but controllable numbers.</p>

<p>'A strategy where you're trying to eradicate it would mean that if you had one case you would go back into lockdown. That's the difference,' he said.  </p>

<p>'This thing, it moves so fast, so silently, that it can get away from you so fast.</p>

<p>'You've got to beat it first then you can find that new normal.'</p>

<p>On Monday Victoria announced nine more deaths from coronavirus, taking the state toll to 675 and the national figure to 762.</p>

<p>But there was some good news for the state, with new case numbers dropping significantly on Monday to 41.</p>

<p>It is Victoria's lowest daily case number since June 26.</p>

<p>Monday's figures come as Victorian small business rails against the government's roadmap out of lockdown restrictions, with Melbourne under stage-four measures for another fortnight.</p>

<p>A broader state-wide reopening is still months away, but Victorian deputy premier James Merlino said the government is doing all it can to have the economy moving again in a COVID-safe way.</p>

<p>Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell said owners are struggling under the weight of costs, including rent, equipment leases, loans and an accumulation of worker entitlements.</p>

<p>'What small businesses are telling us is that they are giving up,' she told Nine's Today program on Monday.</p>

<p>'For many of them, they are not going to be open until the end of November.'</p>

<p>Mr Andrews (pictured) said after lockdown is lifted there will be cases but they would not necessarily mean a return to harsh restrictions</p>

<p>Mr Merlino said the worst thing the government could do for business was open up and then a few weeks later reimpose restrictions because of a third wave.</p>

<p>'You've got to get the (infection) numbers down ... and once we do that then we can have a much broader reopening of our economy,' he told ABC radio.</p>

<p>Mr Merlino believes the state's voters are behind the government's suppression strategy.</p>

<p>'People are with us and they don't want to be put at risk,' he said.</p>

<p>'People understand that we need to ease restrictions safely and steadily.' </p>
