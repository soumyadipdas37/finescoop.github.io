<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Queensland mother was shocked to find a two-metre long python curled up in her young son's bed on a cold rainy day. </p>

<p>Stuart McKenzie, from Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers, was called to the Beerwah home on Monday after the reptile was discovered soaking up the heat of an electric blanket.  </p>

<p>Even the seasoned snake catcher was stunned when he caught sight of the 'massive' carpet python in the child's bedroom. </p>

<p>'Holy dooley look at the size of it, just sitting on the bed,' Mr McKenzie said.</p>

<p>'It's definitely not something you expect to see on your bed.' </p>

<p>A Queensland family were shocked when they discovered a two metre long carpet python taking up residence on their young son's bed (pictured)</p>

<p>The parents sent a picture of the snake to their son who was excited and wanted to post it to his social media. </p>

<p>It's thought the snake made its way inside to escape heavy rain before sensing the electric blanket and making a beeline for the young boy's bed. </p>

<p>After uncurling the reptile Mr McKenzie said it was even bigger than the two metres he had estimated.  </p>

<p>He was able to successfully capture the animal and move it outside before warning viewers there are some 'big snakes on the move at the moment'. </p>

<p>Snake catcher Stuart McKenzie said the snake (pictured) was attracted to the bed because of an electric blanket which had been left on, warning snakes were currently on the move </p>

<p>The start of spring has prompted calls for Australians to be on their guard as snakes move around and can become aggressive if looking for a mate or threatened.</p>

<p>The Australian Reptile Park's head of venom, Billy Collett, said they don't go out to hurt humans but if threatened they will attack, which can be fatal. </p>

<p>'All households should keep grass areas around houses low and well maintained, also avoid piling up left over wood from winter or accumulating stick piles,' he said.</p>

<p>'Tin sheets or any household items like these that are piled up, can draw in heat providing a perfect man made habitat for snakes.' </p>

<p>He said if one is startled while it's lying in wait for prey than it will most likely lash out with a bite to defend itself. </p>

<p>The Royal Flying Doctor Service said there are around 3,000 snake bites recorded in Australia each year with an average of two deaths. </p>

<p>After uncurling the snake (pictured) Mr McKenzie said it was probably larger than the two metres he had originally estimated</p>
