<p>Meanwhile Vicky Pattinson commented 'Congrats you beautiful girl' while Lottie Tomlinson wrote 'Congratulations' along with a love heart.</p>

<p>Loved-up: The pair were enjoying a loved up couple's holiday in Ibiza when business owner Charlie popped the question</p>

<p>Nicola quit Made In Chelsea at the end of 2016 after more than a year on the show, following the breakdown of her romance with Alex Mytton.  </p>

<p>The former couple were an item for two years, after meeting in August 2014 while he was DJing in Ireland.</p>

<p>However, Nicola, who was once romantically linked to Cheryl's ex-husband Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini, was left heartbroken when he ended their romance via text, while she was enjoying a family holiday in Florence, Italy. </p>

<p>Cute: Nicola regularly shares sweet pictures with her beau Charlie on her social media since they started dating </p>

<p>Happy: Nicola discussed her blossoming romance with Charlie in an interview with The Irish Independent two years ago, saying 'He's a very normal guy. He's a lovely guy'</p>

<p>Speaking to Hot Press magazine in 2018, Nicola said of their split: 'He cheated on me and it all kind of went spiralling downwards. Oh, God, I was devastated. Absolutely. I've had counselling about it.</p>

<p>'In extreme cases, when I broke up with my ex, I took tablets to calm me down. Or if I'm travelling I take some stuff to calm me down. I'm a really bad traveller – planes, tubes, sometimes in taxis. I don't like being in any confined space.</p>

<p>'I go to events regularly and they can make me panicky because I'm surrounded by loads of people. So, it's weird the job I do because I do suffer from that really badly.' </p>

<p>Quality time: Charlie owns a recruitment company in the city and Nicola was a regular on E4 reality series Made In Chelsea</p>

<p>Nicola discussed her blossoming romance with Charlie in an interview with The Irish Independent two years ago, saying 'Charlie isn't in the reality world. </p>

<p>'He's a very normal guy. He has a recruitment company in the city. He's a lovely guy,' she said.</p>

<p>'We've been going out for nearly nine months now, I think. We met through Alex. I was dating him after Alex and then we stopped for a while, but now we've started again. It's very nice.'</p>
