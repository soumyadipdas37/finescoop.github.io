<p>'I will love you forever. Rest In Peace my beautiful big sister, the world lost one of its treasures yesterday but heaven gained one. You will be dearly missed by all whose lives you touched.' </p>

<p>'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child.'</p>

<p>Lisa's ex-husband Grant broke the news of their daughter's death on Monday with a public statement.</p>

<p>Jaimi was the couple's eldest child, and a sibling to sister Morgan and son Jett. </p>

<p>Lisa and Grant married in 1986 and were one of Australia's most famous couples with both enjoying individual sporting success on the world stage.</p>

<p>But after their separation in 2019, Grant has since welcomed a fourth child with radio presenter Fifi Box, while Lisa married Elvis impersonator Mark Tabone in 2018.</p>

<p>Jaimi continued a close friendship with Fifi even after she separated from her father. </p>

<p>Lisa's husband Mark Tabone also addressed the tragedy in an Instagram post on Tuesday.</p>

<p>'As the tears flow and the heart aches, I write this as a tribute to beautiful young lady, who's life ended way too soon,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'Bright, caring and loving soul': The 58-year-old former competitive swimmer spoke of her 'unbearable' pain in a gut-wrenching Instagram post on Tuesday (above). Her post was interspersed with pink floral emojis - an ode to Jaimi's 'love of flowers'</p>

<p>Sad: 'Our hearts are broken and the pain is unbearable but we cherish every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured and so loved first child,' Lisa said </p>

<p>Pillar of support: He thanked the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'</p>

<p>'As your mother and father weep your loss, I too feel lost and heavy hearted. Nobody should ever lose their child. </p>

<p>'You always put everybody else first. You were gifted with many talents, amazing cook, arts and crafts, writing, and your love and creativity with flowers.' </p>

<p>He went on to thank the public for their condolences and said his 'job now is to nurture my wife through this unimaginable time'.</p>

<p>The Curry-Kenny family confirmed Jaimi's death on Monday afternoon with a public statement.</p>

<p>'It is with a very heavy heart that Lisa and I confirm that our beautiful daughter Jaimi has lost her battle with a long-term illness and passed away peacefully in hospital this morning in the company of loving family,' read a statement from Grant Kenny.</p>

<p>'Jaimi will forever be remembered as a caring, bright and loving soul who always put others before herself.</p>

<p>'Our hearts are broken and the pain is immense but we must move forward cherishing every wonderful moment we got to share with our treasured first child. </p>

<p>New chapter: In 2013, Grant, 57, welcomed a daughter named Trixie Belle with radio presenter Fifi Box (right). Fifi - who had a close friendship with her ex's adult children, including Jaimi (left) - did not acknowledge Grant was the father of her daughter until 2016. Pictured in 2017</p>

<p>'We thank the incredible team at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital for their tireless commitment to making her better and giving us as the extra time we were able to spend with her.</p>

<p>'It goes without saying that this is a very difficult time for family and friends and we trust we will all be allowed to grieve in privacy.'</p>

<p>Jaimi had just turned 33 in June, with her mother taking to social media at the time to wish her a happy birthday. </p>

<p>'Our first born. Really... where have all those years gone! Have a lovely day bubba. We all love you so much,' Lisa wrote. </p>
