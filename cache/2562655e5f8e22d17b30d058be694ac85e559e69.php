<p>Richard Doggett, 72, was killed in a freak accident on his property at Numulgi, near Lismore, on Friday</p>

<p>The former boss of Richmond AFL club has died in a tragic accident on his macadamia farm in northern New South Wales</p>

<p>'We send our deepest sympathy to Richard's family and friends.'</p>

<p>Mr Doggett died just days before the club was set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1980 Grand Final victory.</p>

<p>He spent two periods as the club's general manager, during 1979-1980 and again in 1986-1988. </p>

<p>'He also served as the Club's Treasurer in 1979-80,' Richmond FC wrote.</p>

<p>Mr Doggett then became an executive at Conrad Jupiters Casino on the Gold Coast before moving to Numulgi 13 years ago.</p>

<p>Since then he has been heavily involved in the Macadamia nut industry.</p>

<p>He had been growing macadamia nuts on his property and was also the chairman of the Australian Macadamia Society.</p>

<p>'It's certainly a lot cheaper to buy a macadamia farm than to get a house in Sydney at the moment, so come on up. We want to see you,' he told the ABC in 2015.</p>

<p>Richmond FC posted a touching tribute to Mr Doggett on social media: 'Richmond is mourning the passing of 1980 premiership General Manager Richard Doggett'</p>

<p>Mr Doggett died just days before the club is set to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the 1980 Grand Final victory</p>

<p>In the 1970s, he worked at Wrest Point and was the driving force behind the first Staff association and staff Magazine INTERWREST. </p>

<p>He then took on a position with the Southern Tasmanian Australian Rules association as Marketing Manager where he doubled the crowds in his first year.</p>

<p>His success there is what attracted Richmond FC to him - and he worked in marketing and as the club secretary before becoming director.</p>

<p>Friend Mick Caban wrote on Facebook that he 'had the honour of calling Richard my friend for over 45 years'. </p>

<p>'Richard had a special gift of making people feel that they were special,' he wrote.   </p>

<p>Mr Doggett's social media pages are littered with photos of himself and his wife travelling the world and enjoying nights out together. </p>

<p>A NSW Police spokesperson said a report is being prepared for the coroner but the death is not being treated as suspicious.   </p>
