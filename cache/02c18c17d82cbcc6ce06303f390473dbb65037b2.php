<p>Star-studded: The England side has seen an array of stars taking part since Soccer Aid began back in 2006</p>

<p>Last month Kem admitted he came close to pulling out of the matching after tearing his hamstring during training.</p>

<p>He told The Sun: 'I was pushing myself too hard and one day I heard it pop and I was in agony. It happened about three weeks before the game. </p>

<p>'It started bruising up straight away so I knew it was bad. The next day I saw the physio and he said I'd torn it.</p>

<p>Don't stop! Yung Filly was pursued by Katie Chapman and Mark as he headed for the goal</p>

<p>Funnyman: Comedian John Bishop has also made a return to the England squad</p>

<p>Getting in shape: Love Island narrator Iain Stirling led the stars from the World XI in the midst of training</p>

<p>'He was like, 'Realistically you probably shouldn't play but we can give it our best shot', so I'm just hoping for the best.</p>

<p>'I'd rather get injured again in the game and play a bit than watch on the side and feel gutted. I'll just see how I get on.</p>

<p>His reality star pal, Mark Wright, reportedly suffered a similar fate in 2019 when he tore his hamstring.</p>

<p>Back to work: Harry Redknapp has returned to manage the international side, along with Bryan Robson and Vic Bettinelli</p>
