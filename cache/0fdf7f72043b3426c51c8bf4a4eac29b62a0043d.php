<p>Elsewhere in the interview, co-panellist Chris Bath grilled the former Survivor star: 'Locky, what is harder? Doing a challenge after 20 days of little food or breaking a girl's heart dumping her on TV hours after telling her you love her?' </p>

<p>He responded: 'That was one of the hardest things I had to do. I will do a challenge for four day straights if it means I did haven't to break someone's heart. </p>

<p>'As you saw on TV, my emotions were real. It sucked. You never want to be, have that feeling for someone and then have to break their heart,' he added.</p>

<p>He broke down in tears as Bella arrived to face the music, telling her he 'fell in love' the first day he saw her, before coming up with a rather feeble excuse to end things.</p>

<p>'I know you don't, like, sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty,' he said, as Bella looked at him in utter disbelief.</p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added, to which the brunette replied: 'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me.'</p>

<p>Instead, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with nurse Irena.</p>

<p>He told her: 'When I think about our future together, I'm, like, so excited and, like, I can't wait to just travel the world and, like, make all your dreams come true.'</p>

<p>'Irena, I'm so in love with you. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you.'</p>

<p>Happy ending! In the end, Locky chose to pursue a relationship with Irena</p>
