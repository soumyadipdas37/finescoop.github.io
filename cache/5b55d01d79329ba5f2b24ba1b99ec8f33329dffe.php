<p>OnlyFans is an online service that allows for public figures to charge fans a subscription to their site, where they often share content usually deemed too provocative for other social media platforms.</p>

<p>Pia has also given her followers another opportunity to dent their bank accounts, as she's added an Amazon wishlist link to her profile – asking for everything from suitcases to lamps to LED strip lights.   </p>

<p>Since launching in September 2016, OnlyFans has reportedly paid out more than $1 billion to creators, according to the company. The service currently boasts over 50 million registered users and 700,000 content creators. </p>
