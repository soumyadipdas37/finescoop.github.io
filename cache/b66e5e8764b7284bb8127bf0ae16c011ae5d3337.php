<p>The FA launched a probe after a player was allegedly subjected to racist abuse from the crowd</p>

<p>And the shocking incidents prompted Hounslow United to take matters into their own hands as they decided not to continue the game. An FA spokesperson said: ‘We are aware of the allegations and we are currently investigating the matter.’</p>

<p>Sevenoaks said in a post on Twitter following the match: ‘Today’s game has been abandoned. We are investigating an alleged matter and no further comment will be made until this process has been concluded.’</p>

<p>Sevenoaks confirmed they had been gathering witness statements as part of the probe.</p>

<p>Hounslow have been asked for their observations by the FA, who are awaiting the referee’s report as part of their investigation.</p>

<p>The FA Cup tie was abandoned at Sevenoaks Town when Hounslow United chose not to play on</p>

<p>Isthmian League South East side Sevenoaks were 3-0 up at the break after goals from Kyle De Silva, Tyrell Richardson-Brown and James Bessey-Sakdana before the game was halted. No complaint had been made to Kent Police by Sunday night.</p>

<p>Last season an FA Cup qualifying match between non-League Haringey Borough and Yeovil was called off after racist abuse was aimed at players by the crowd.</p>

<p>Haringey’s players walked off after defender Coby Rowe suffered racist abuse, while goalkeeper Douglas Pajetat was spat at and had objects thrown at him, with Yeovil agreeing not to finish the match in a display of solidarity.</p>

<p>The incident led to five men being arrested.</p>
