<p>Legging  it: Rumer Willis was 1950s chic when she was glimpsed emerging from lockdown in Los Angeles this Thursday</p>

<p>Rumer's sleek ensemble featured a beige and navy spotted pattern against a white field, with the blue concentrated at the hems, cuffs and collar.</p>

<p>Letting her luxurious curly hair down she made sure to take the precaution of wearing a mask as she emerged from lockdown.</p>

<p>Slinging a black handbag from one shoulder, she pulled on a pair of white sneakers and matching socks for her latest outing.</p>

<p>Last month Rumer celebrated her 32nd birthday and could be spotted on social media starring in an Instagram album posted by her sister Scout.</p>

<p>Off she goes: The 32-year-old daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore emphasized her slim figure in a fitted 1950s chic collared dress</p>

<p>'Rumer is my best friend. I have the privilege of sitting next to her outside right now so let me just narrate what I am seeing: She is in the deep splendor of her 32 year, radiating the ultimate glow that comes from being a genuinely good person and being committed to always growing and learning about herself in service to emanating ever more compassion, love and grace,' wrote Scout.</p>

<p>'She is fully swathed in gauzy cotton with long Gorgina hair, a crown atop her head that reads "it’s my birthday" enjoying her special day as only a Leo can!' she added.</p>

<p>'I’m so lucky, Rumer is my best friend, so lucky that she is my big sister, so lucky that she has always looked out for me and taught me how to walk through the world. Her being my big sister means that I’ve never had a minute of my life without her, and I wouldn’t want it any other way,' Scout continued.</p>
