<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Zoe Ball has become the second highest paid star at the BBC after being handed a £1million pay rise for her Radio 2 role – as the broadcaster revealed its staff bill has rocketed to £1.5billion.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old is now the highest earning women at the corporation fetching £1.3million but is still lagging behind Match of the Day’s Gary Lineker who is now on £1.75million.</p>

<p>BBC accounts released at midday showed 76 presenters still earn more than the Prime Minister’s wage of £150,000 a year.</p>

<p>Radio 2 DJ Zoe Ball is now the highest paid female star at the BBC after the pay rise</p>

<p>It came as it emerged last night that the BBC had given pay rises to more than 700 female employees since the start of its equal pay scandal.</p>

<p>A Freedom of Information request revealed that at least 84 women were given pay increases through formal processes between July 2017 and March 2020.</p>

<p>During the same period, 608 women received a pay revision or increase through an informal pay enquiry.</p>

<p>The pay revelations are set to reignite fury over the BBC’s decision to strip almost 4million over-75s of their free TV licences.</p>

<p>The BBC has insisted it cannot afford the concession for all pensioners and says only around 900,000 who receive Pension Credit would continue to get it.</p>

<p>Gary Lineker is still the broadcaster's highest paid stars the new accounts showed today</p>

<p>Last night pensioners’ groups demanded the corporation slash star pay if they are to expect over-75s to pay for their licences.</p>

<p>Dennis Reed, of pensioners’ campaign group Silver Voices, said: ‘This increase shows a warped sense of priorities by the BBC in a time of difficulty.</p>

<p>'I would like to see them giving equal priority to poorer pensioners who struggle to pay their licence fee.’</p>

<p>The report shows there are now two stars raking in more than £1million, another earns between £500,000 and £1million, and 73 are on between £150,000 and £500,000.</p>

<p>Graham Norton and Steve Wright came in 3rd and 4th place in the BBC pay list today</p>

<p>And it says spend on on-air roles represents 10 per cent of total internal creative content – the same as the year before.</p>

<p>Tim Davie, the BBC’s new director-general, has vowed to slash the number of people employed by the corporation.</p>

<p>But the report is believed to show the total number has barely changed. It also reveals virtually the same number of senior managers as there were in the previous year.</p>

<p>Mr Davie is set to expand on his previous comments about tackling staffing levels in a speech today.</p>

<p>A source said: ‘[Mr Davie] will warn that public service BBC staffing levels must come down in the future.’</p>

<p>The ‘on-air talent’ bill covers those who appear on screen and on the radio.</p>
