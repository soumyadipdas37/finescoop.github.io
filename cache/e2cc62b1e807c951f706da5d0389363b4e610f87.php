<p>Sashi is adamant Ryan was not even recognised by producers, despite appearing alongside him on MasterChef Australia in 2018 at the family reunion.</p>

<p>The 11-year-old applied like everybody else, the 41-year-old said, and was not approached for the show due to his family connection.</p>

<p>Former MasterChef Australia winner Sashi Cheliah has revealed his son Ryan (pictured)  was not given special treatment when applying for the junior series of the hit cooking show</p>

<p>It was not until the first stage of the casting process that the young cook was recognised as a familiar face on the tenth season of Channel 10's show.</p>

<p>'I put in an application and then they called for an audition. So it's only after the audition that they realised Ryan is my son,' Sashi said, HuffPost Australia reported.</p>

<p>Discovering he would follow in his father's footsteps this month, Ryan has made plans to make a name for himself, instead of being known as 'Sashi's son'.</p>

<p>He added his father's advice to him being on the show included being creative in the kitchen, never giving up and always having a smile while cooking. </p>

<p>'People are going to know me for me, Ryan, instead of, "Oh that's Sashi's son",' the young cook told HuffPost Australia. </p>

<p>'My favourite thing to cook is a fish curry. Even though it may be a bit complicated, it's full of flavour and I really like eating it.'</p>

<p>'We are so thrilled to be bringing Junior MasterChef Australia to life very soon,' Melissa said in July. </p>

<p>'To be showcasing a generation of kids who have grown up with the show and who have literally been cooking for most of their lives, you know this is going to be spectacular.</p>
