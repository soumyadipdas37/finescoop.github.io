<p>The discount retailer signed a million-dollar deal with Tesco, the UK's largest supermarket, to be able to sell its top items four months ago.</p>

<p>The groundbreaking supply deal comes as The Reject Shop tries to reposition itself as a bigger player on the Australian retail scene.  </p>

<p>Sure to be a hit with British expats, the range includes Tesco Gold Instant Coffee 100g for $6, tinned vegetable soup, bottles of vinegar and packets of rice cakes for $2 and Tesco biscuits are range from $2 to $2.50. </p>

<p>The products are currently available at all stores in New South Wales, Canberra and Queensland, meanwhile Victoria will have the range at the end of the week </p>

<p>The Reject Shop CEO Andre Reich said the supply deal meant huge savings were here to stay.</p>

<p>'We've teamed up with one of the biggest supermarkets in the world selling their best-selling lines. The higher the volume we buy, the cheaper it will be for customers,' he said.</p>

<p>'A lot of people are struggling to make ends meet, that's one thing COVID has taught us. We're all facing tough economic times. This is about giving Australians the best-quality products at the best price,' he told news.com.au.</p>

<p>The discount chain, which first launched four decades ago, is eyeing up the likes of Aldi and Kmart and already employs over 5,300 workers across Australia, generating more than $800million in sales each year. </p>

<p>The products are now available at all stores in New South Wales, Canberra and Queensland, while Victoria will have the range at the end of the week.</p>

<p>South Australia, Tasmania and Western Australia will have the new grocery items by the end of September. </p>

<p>Because of Tesco's buying power, The Reject Shop has assured customers it will always be fully stocked with cheap items. </p>

<p>In August, financial services firm Morgan Stanley suggested the The Reject Shop could become a $3billion stock within the next 10 years as it moves towards a younger consumer-based feeling the economic pinch from COVID-19. </p>

<p>As well as dry-store packaged food, Tesco will also supply The Reject Shop with a range of health and beauty products in coming months as well as other household items.</p>

<p>Although both parties admit the unusual deal may take some customers by surprise, Tesco Group Export Director Jack Brabin said it will be a major windfall for Australian consumers - along with the 1.2 million British expats living Down Under.</p>

<p>Gross profit increased 0.3 per cent to $335.8million.</p>
