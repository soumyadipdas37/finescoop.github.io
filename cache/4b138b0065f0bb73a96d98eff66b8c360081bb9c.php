<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham are ready to loan out young goalkeeper Alfie Whiteman.</p>

<p>A number of League One and League Two clubs have shown interest in the 21-year-old and Spurs are keen for him to go out and gain more competitive game time.</p>

<p>Whiteman has been at the club since 2015 and is under contract until 2022. A former England Under 19 international, Whiteman was born and bred in Tottenham, is a lifelong Spurs fan and figured on the bench last season.</p>

<p>He trains regularly with the first team but with the arrival of Joe Hart only adding to the competition, Whiteman is ready to step out and gain experience elsewhere.</p>

<p>Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Alfie WhitemanÂ  is available to go out on loan</p>

<p>Many lower league clubs are interested in a short term deal for the 21-year-old</p>

<p>Tottenham also have Brandon Austin available for loan. He had a spell at Viborg in Denmark earlier this season while they have also fielded enquiries for Paulo Gazzaniga.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho is happy with his goalkeeping options but still wants to strengthen his attack and defence.</p>

<p>They hold an interest in Real Madrid left-back Sergio Reguilon, who has been talking to Manchester United, but any proposed deal for Crystal Palace striker Alexander Sorloth looks unlikely.</p>
