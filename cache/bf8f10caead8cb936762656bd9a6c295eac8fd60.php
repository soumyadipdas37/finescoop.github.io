<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's rising coronavirus infection rate may actually speed up vaccine trials and move the world one step closer to eradicating the disease, scientists say.</p>

<p>The UK is now well and truly in the midst of a second wave, with 6,000 new cases every day and hospital admissions doubling every week.</p>

<p>Britons have been told they will need to live with tough new lockdown restrictions for another six months, with ministers banking on a jab being ready by then.</p>

<p>Oxford University's front-runner vaccine candidate was supposed to be rolled out this autumn but trials came to a standstill when infection rates petered out over summer.</p>

<p>Studies had to be moved abroad to the likes of Brazil, the US and South Africa - where coronavirus was still rife - to test if the jab can prevent infection.</p>

<p>In order to prove beyond doubt a vaccine works, scientists need to inoculate tens of thousands of people then send them back into the community and wait for some to get infected.</p>

<p>This has been a sticking point for the Oxford team because there was barely any Covid-19 transmission for months in the UK. But experts have told MailOnline the one 'silver lining' to Britain's climbing Covid-19 rates is that it could speed up this process. </p>

<p>It comes amid concerns that Britain will not be able to vaccinate the entire country until at least 2022 because of logistical concerns at various stages in the supply chain.</p>

<p>Everyone over the age of 80 and NHS staff will be second in line, updated guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation states</p>

<p>Professor Paul Hunter, a medical expert and epidemiologist at the University of East Anglia, told MailOnline higher transmission in Britain 'should indeed speed things up somewhat'. </p>

<p>Early trials of Oxford University's jab have yielded promising results, with tests showing the vaccine is safe to use in humans and appears to provoke an immune response. But data that proves it protects people is not expected until later this year. </p>

<p>Care home residents and staff will be the first to get a Covid-19 vaccine when one is approved, according to fresh government advice.</p>

<p>Everyone over the age of 80 and NHS staff will be second in line, updated guidance from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation states.</p>

<p>The body, which consists of 20 top scientists, advises ministers on all vaccines. It admitted its guidance for any UK Covid-19 vaccination scheme is likely to change in the future.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock previously pledged that Britons with underlying conditions would be near the front of the queue for any jab. But millions living with heart disease or other ailments that raise their risk of dying of Covid-19 won't be vaccinated until everyone over the age of 65 is inoculated, according to the new guidance. </p>

<p>WHO WILL GET A COVID-19 JAB FIRST?</p>

<p>Under the proposed ranking by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the vaccines will be rolled out in the following order:</p>

<p>To prove without doubt that it protects people from infection, vaccines need to go through rigorous phase three trials.</p>

<p>In these tests, the vaccine is being given to tens of thousands of people in real-world environments to see if it stops them from catching Covid-19 in the community. </p>

<p>The Oxford scientists behind the jab had to move their studies abroad over the summer – to South Africa and Brazil where Covid-19 is still rife – to speed up the trials.</p>

<p>There were not enough people catching the virus in the UK to be able to reliably test whether the jab was working - but this may not be the case over winter when experts anticipate a large scale resurgence of Covid-19.</p>

<p>However, Professor Ian Jones, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline that it was dangerous to put a positive spin on Britain's spiralling outbreak.</p>

<p>He said the stance risks a 'the more, the merrier' view, 'which would not be advisable' because it may encourage people not to abide by lockdown rules.</p>

<p>Professor Jones added: 'The only positive spin currently would be that numbers appear to be following Spain/France as they did the first time around and as we are about two weeks behind them we have time to try and slow the spread if we can get realistic measures right.' </p>

<p>It comes as another drug giant launched the final-stage trial of its coronavirus jab. Novavax will test its double-dose vaccine - which the UK government has already bought 60million doses of - on 10,000 volunteers in the UK. </p>

<p>They will be held across the country including in Greater Manchester, London, Glasgow and Belfast.</p>

<p>Sixty million doses of the vaccine have been secured by the Government, to be manufactured in Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, if it is successful. The Government has also already pre-ordered 100million doses of Oxford's vaccine.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged to deliver the shot to the most vulnerable - including the very elderly - by early next year, if it's not possible by the end of 2020.  </p>

<p>Mr Hancock has suggested there could be a 'mass roll-out' within the first half of 2021. </p>

<p>But today experts expressed concerns that this could be delayed for two years due to supply chain issues.</p>

<p>The UK is said to be short on glass vials - used to store the vaccine - and refrigerated lorries used to transport doses around the country without spoiling them.</p>

<p>Philip Ashton, chief exec of logistics group 7Bridges - which is working on the delivery of the Oxford vaccine - told iNews: 'I am not aware that the Government has spoken to the Oxford Vaccine Group (OVG) about the logistics of getting a vaccine to the entire population yet.</p>

<p>'We may not get the mass vaccination on the timeline we think. It is doable if the Government commences the planning right now.</p>

<p>'We can expect frontline workers and high-risk populations to be vaccinated by the end of next year, but vaccinating the entire population is a real challenge.'</p>

<p>The logistics expert said he believes the UK is short of  'cold chain' trucks used to transport the vaccine.</p>

<p>Oxford's vaccine needs to be kept at exactly between 2C and 8C during transportation or it risks going off.</p>

<p>1. GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi Pasteur: 60million doses </p>

<p>The Government revealed on July 29 it had signed a deal with pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Sanofi Pasteur</p>

<p>If the vaccine proves successful, the UK could begin to vaccinate priority groups, such as frontline health and social care workers and those at increased risk from coronavirus, as early as the first half of next year, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said. </p>

<p>Human clinical studies of the vaccine will begin in September followed by a phase 3 study in December. </p>

<p>The vaccine is based on the existing technology used to produce Sanofi's seasonal flu vaccine. Genetic material from the surface protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is inserted into insect cells - the basis of Sanofi’s influenza product - and then injected to provoke an immune response in a human patient.  </p>

<ol start="2">
<li>AstraZeneca (manufacturing University of Oxford's): 100million</li>
</ol>

<p>AstraZeneca, which is working in partnership with Oxford University, is already manufacturing the experimental vaccine after a deal was struck on May 17.</p>

<p>Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading the Oxford team, is confident the jab could be ready for the most vulnerable people by the end of the year.</p>

<p>Her comments came after the results from the first phase, published in The Lancet on July 20, showed promise.</p>

<p>The team have genetically engineered a virus to look like the coronavirus - to have the same spike proteins on the outside - but be unable to cause any infection inside a person. This virus, weakened by genetic engineering, is a type of virus called an adenovirus, the same as those which cause common colds, that has been taken from chimpanzees. </p>

<p>3.  BioNTech/Pfizer: 30million </p>

<p>US drug giant Pfizer - most famous for making Viagra - and German firm BioNTech were revealed to have secured a deal with the UK Government on July 20.</p>

<p>It reported positive results from the ongoing phase 2/3 clinical trial of one called BNT162b1 on July 1.  The company is still running phase 2 trials at the moment.</p>

<p>Pfizer's vaccine is one called an mRNA vaccine, which do not directly inject bits of the virus into the body but send genetic material.</p>

<p>mRNA vaccines programme the body to produce parts of the virus itself by injecting the body with a molecule that tells disease-fighting cells what to build. The immune system then learns how to fight it.</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>Valneva: 60million </li>
</ol>

<p>The Government has given Valneva — whose vaccine is understood to be in the preclinical stages of development — an undisclosed amount of money to expand its factory in Livingston, Scotland. </p>

<p>While the Government revealed a 60million dose deal on July 20, the company said it had reached agreement in principle with the UK government to provide up to 100million doses. </p>

<p>Valneva's jab is an inactivated whole virus vaccine, meaning it injects a damaged version of the coronavirus itself into the body.</p>

<p>The virus has been destroyed in a way that makes it unable to cause infection, but the body still recognises it as a dangerous intruder and therefore mounts an immune response which it can remember in case of a real Covid-19 infection. </p>

<ol start="5">
<li>Janssen (Johnson &amp; Johnson): 30million</li>
</ol>

<p>The Government has agreed to buy 30million doses of a vaccine made by Janssen if it works.</p>

<p>Officials have agreed to help the company in its development of the jab by part-funding a global clinical trial. The first in-human trials of Janssen's jab began in mid-July and are being done on adults over the age of 18 in the US and Belgium.</p>

<p>The jab is named Ad26.COV2-S, recombinant, and is a type of jab called a viral vector recombinant vaccine.</p>

<p>Proteins that appear on the outside of the coronavirus are reproduced in a lab and then injected into the body to stimulate an immune reaction.</p>

<p>The 'Ad' part of the vaccine's name means it works using an adenovirus - a virus best known for causing the common cold - as a vehicle to transport the coronavirus genetics into the body.</p>

<ol start="6">
<li>Novavax: 60million</li>
</ol>

<p>Britain has ordered 60million doses of a vaccine being developed by the US-based company Novavax. It will help to fund late-stage clinical trials in the UK and also boost plans to manufacture the vaccine in Britain.</p>

<p>Novavax's jab, named NVX-CoV2373, showed positive results in early clinical trials.</p>

<p>It produced an immune response in 100 per cent of people who received it, the company said, and was safe and 'generally well-tolerated'. </p>

<p>Novavax's candidate is also a recombinant vaccine and transports the spike proteins found on the outside of the coronavirus into the body in order to provoke the immune system. </p>

<ol start="7">
<li>Imperial College London: Unknown quantity</li>
</ol>

<p>Imperial College London scientists are working on Britain's second home-grown hope for a jab. The candidate is slightly behind Oxford's vaccine in terms of its progress through clinical trials, but is still a major player.</p>

<p>The UK Government is understood to have agreed to buy the vaccine if it works but details of a deal have not yet been publicised. </p>

<p>Imperial's jab is currently in second-phase human trials after early tests showed it appeared to be safe. </p>

<p>Imperial College London will try to deliver genetic material (RNA) from the coronavirus which programs cells inside the patient's body to recreate the spike proteins. It will transport the RNA inside liquid droplets injected into the bloodstream. </p>
