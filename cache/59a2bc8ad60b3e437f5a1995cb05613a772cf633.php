<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sydney has been rocked by 29 shootings in less than five weeks as bikie feuds and low-level drug wars explode in suburban neighbourhoods.</p>

<p>A worrying map has revealed Sydney's south-west is at the centre of the gang-linked violence, with over a dozen drive-by shootings in recent weeks.  </p>

<p>Acting Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna said police were ramping up patrols and resources after a huge surge in shootings since August 1. </p>

<p>Ten of the shootings have been in regional NSW and 19 in Sydney's central metro region, which covers the CBD, eastern suburbs, Inner West and Sutherland Shire. </p>

<p>Just three days into the new month and there have already been three shootings - all in the central metro region.</p>

<p>A worrying map has revealed Sydney's south-west has had an outbreak of crime believed to be linked to outlaw motorcycle gang conflicts</p>

<p>Police cordon off the area before forensic officers arrive at Knoll Avenue in Turella after a shooting last week</p>

<p>In the most recent shooting, bullets were sprayed into a home in Fairfield Heights just after 10.15pm on Wednesday.</p>

<p>No one was injured during the shooting and police believe it was targeted.  </p>

<p>One of the attacks left infamous former Comanchero bikie Fares Abounader dead outside his home in Panania on August 29.</p>

<p>Police believe Abounader, who was present during the Sydney Airport bikie brawl, was a victim of a targeted shooting amid tension between the Comancheros and Bandidos.  </p>

<p>However, officers now suspect the botched hit on Turrella businessman Mohamed Saab three days earlier was related.</p>

<p>NSW Police Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said there are now a handful of theories about Abounader's death.</p>

<p>'We've uncovered at least five indicators around why (Mr Abounader's) shooting occurred … we've had discussions with particular (bikie gangs) about acceptable behaviour. Anyone that participates in a public place shooting carries 25 years to life in prison,' Mr Smith said. </p>

<p>Mark Shammo was shot in the legs and torso on Garrong Road in Lakemba on September 1</p>

<p>Mr Smith said both Abounader and Saab had alleged links to outlaw motorcycle gang conflicts, while most of the other hits are believed to be targeted. </p>

<p>'It is not acceptable under any circumstances,' Mr McKenna said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter who is involved in these shootings - it's not acceptable and we will come down on them.'</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith says the shootings are a result of individual conflicts, and could relate to low-level drug dealing which has been made harder given the border closures.</p>

<p>Shots were fired in a unit with three people inside on Columbine Avenue in Punchbowl on September 2</p>

<p>'We have seen COVID-19 putting some pressure in terms of the ability of organised crime to move illicit prohibited drugs into the state,' Mr Smith told reporters.</p>

<p>'There is some indication it's reflecting a higher than average price for drugs which is possible that some of this low-level stuff is a conflict occurring around the payment of drugs.'</p>

<p>Mr Smith said it was 'unacceptable' and 'dangerous' to other members of the public, warning the punishment could be life in prison.</p>

<p>'These people are taking a significant risk that they will spend a lifetime behind bars,' he said.</p>

<p>So far eight shootings have resulted in nine people being charged. </p>

<p>Mohamed Saab (pictured) was found with gunshot wounds to his shoulder, ribs and leg outside a home in Turrella</p>
