<p>During a speech at the 2020 HeliRussia exhibition, the head of Russia's state space agency Dmitry Rogozin claimed the country was the 'first and only one' to land on the planet, The Moscow Times reports.</p>

<p>His statement comes after experts from the UK said they had found signs of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere — suggesting the planet must support unknown chemical processes, or even life.</p>

<p>Experts from the UK said they had found signs of phosphine in Venus' atmosphere — suggesting the planet must support unknown chemical processes, or even life</p>

<p>But Rogozin claimed prior research by Russian scientists had shown Venus to be inhospitable, adding: 'The spacecraft gathered information about the planet, it is like hell over there.'</p>

<p>As well as Rogozin's claims that Venus is 'Russian', Rocosmos revealed earlier this week that it plans to do its own mission to the planet. </p>

<p>As part of the announcement it said the expedition would be conducted 'without involving wide international cooperation'.  </p>

<p>The latest mission plans will be conducted in addition to another, Venera-D, which the country is due to take part in alongside the U.S in 2026 or 2031. </p>

<p>As well as Rogozin's claims that Venus is 'Russian', Rocosmos revealed earlier this week that it plans to do its own mission to the planet which will be conducted 'without involving wide international cooperation'</p>

<p>In response to the revelation of possible life on Venus, the Breakthrough Initiatives programme has said it will carry out its own research into possibility - paid for by billionaire internet mogul Yuri Milner. </p>

<p>The UK research was carried out by astronomer Jane Greaves of Wales' Cardiff University and colleagues observed Venus using both the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope at Hawaii's Mauna Kea Observatory and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile. </p>

<p>On Earth, phosphine — a colourless gas that smells like garlic, or decaying fish — is naturally produced mainly by certain microorganisms in the absence of oxygen.</p>

<p>It can also be released in small amounts from the breakdown of organic matter, or industrially synthesised in chemical plants.</p>

<p>Despite the latest discovery, researchers have cautioned that life is only one possible explanation for the source of the phosphine — with further investigation needed.  </p>
