<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain are confident Dele Alli wants to join the club as talks with Tottenham continue over a 12-month loan deal.</p>

<p>Alli started the opening game of the season against Everton but was hauled off at half-time and then left out of the trips to Lokomotiv Plovdiv and Southampton.</p>

<p>The arrival of Gareth Bale on a season-long loan deal from Real Madrid has also intensified competition for places and forced Alli out of the first team picture. </p>

<p>PSG are confident of signing Dele Alli on a 12-month loan deal before the October 5 deadline</p>

<p>Alli has been left out of Tottenham's last two squads against Plovdiv and Southampton</p>

<p>The England international has struggled for consistency for much of the last two seasons</p>

<p>However, Mourinho's ruthless decision to not name him in his squad has come as a shock to both Alli and his Spurs team-mates. </p>

<p>The England international has struggled for consistency over the past two seasons but has been a regular since Jose Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino.</p>

<p>According to the Telegraph, PSG are now the favourites to be his next club, though the two sides are only discussing a loan move rather than a permanent deal.   </p>

<p>Alli started the opening game against Everton but was hauled off at half-time by Mourinho</p>

<p>Alli scored eight goals in 25 Premier League games last season as Spurs finished sixth</p>

<p>Spurs chairman Daniel Levy is thought to prefer a loan move, in the knowledge that Alli's value has suffered through a combination of poor form and a depressed transfer market. </p>

<p>PSG have a good relationship with Spurs having sold Lucas Moura and Serge Aurier to the Premier League side in recent years and that could help them to clinch a deal before the transfer deadline on October 5. </p>

<p>Alli still has four years left on the contract extension he signed back in 2018 and Spurs are hopeful a loan move will help him to recapture his best form.</p>

<p>There remains interest in Alli from Inter Milan but the Serie A club may struggle to finance a loan move for the 24-year-old.</p>

<p>Last season the former MK Dons midfielder, who joined the club in 2015, scored eight goals in 25 Premier League games as Spurs finished sixth in the top flight. </p>
