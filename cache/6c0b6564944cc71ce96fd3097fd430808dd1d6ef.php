<p>Taking no chances: Their get-together comes after Holly had to cut her seven-week family holiday to Portugal short so she could quarantine to be ready to return to the show in time</p>

<p>The pair were wearing face-masks with their own faces on them at the start of the show and couldn't get over how weird they looked.  </p>

<p>Holly said: 'Don’t adjust your TV sets, there is nothing wrong, we are just wearing masks with our faces on</p>

<p>Phil laughed and said: 'Holly: the best ones are if you have a photo taken of your teeth.'</p>

<p>Doing her bit: Holly cut short her family trip to Portugal to quarantine and be back in time for work and said: 'I've just got out of quarantine so I feel a bit like "wow there's people around'</p>

<p>Happy news: Using the screen, Holly and Phil noted it had been six months since they were last able to safely embrace</p>

<p>Chatting about his own summer break, he said: 'I did the cube for the first time in six years which was amazing, the best series we ever made.</p>

<p>'We played it with two people so some people were in their own bubble. I think its out in October. I'm probably not supposed to have said that but I have.'</p>

<p>Talking about her sunshine break, Holly said: 'I've just got out of quarantine so I feel a bit like "wow there's people around!"</p>

<p>WOW! Holly and Phil were wearing face masks with their own faces on them on the show</p>

<p>Do not adjust your sets: Phil made sure to show off his teeth with his mask </p>

<p>What a way to reunite: The pair looked quite funny in their masks as they started the show</p>

<p>Using the screen, Holly and Phil noted it had been six months since they were last able to safely embrace.</p>

<p>They said they are going to keep the screen for the foreseeable future so they can hug when they wish.   </p>

<p>The TV duo returned to screens on September 1, taking back the reins back from Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford who stood in for them during their hiatus. </p>

<p>The autumn shows will also include a new four-part 'Best of British' series where Nigel Havers will tour around Britain.</p>

<p>Viewers will also be treated to a three-episode series called 'Dr Scott's Super Dogs' which will see the show's resident vet meet dogs who are helping to save lives across the country. </p>
