<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a van driver fly-tipped a mountain of debris on a residential street in broad daylight.</p>

<p>A woman's voice can be heard yelling: 'Oi!' as the driver lifts the back of the truck, sending waste across the pavement in Yardley Wood, Birmingham.</p>

<p>The trucker fled the scene after dumping his load on the street Sunday. </p>

<p>Witnesses reported the matter to the council and on the police non-emergency 101 line in an effort to catch the trucker. </p>

<p>The fly tipper drove up onto the pavement in Yardley Wood, Birmingham to dump his waste </p>

<p>The driver dumped wooden pallets and off cuts of timber along with some scrap on the road</p>

<p>Witnesses said the driver was not concerned about people who were watching him dump his load illegally on the pavement </p>

<p>The council removed the waste shortly afterwards. </p>

<p>According to one witness whose house overlooks the area: 'It made me furious as it's right opposite my home.</p>

<p>'It is not nice to see or look at and someone could have been seriously hurt if perhaps they were partially blind or a child was playing in it.</p>

<p>'Also if someone was coming around the corner on their push bike, they could've ended up on top of it and really hurt themselves.</p>

<p>'I reported it to 101 and the council, who quickly came out and removed it from the footpath as it was a dangerous hazard.</p>

<p>'Also school children would be en route to school in the morning and may have felt the need to walk in the road to avoid it.'</p>

<p>A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: 'Fly-tipping is a criminal offence. It is a crime that damages the environment that we all have to live and work in.</p>

<p>'Where we have credible evidence, we will investigate and prosecute.</p>

<p>'We receive hundreds of reports of fly-tipping across the city every week and do everything we can to remove as much waste as possible and investigate the circumstances behind rubbish that is dumped.</p>

<p>'The council can only prosecute when credible evidence, that meets the criminal burden of proof, is available.'</p>

<p>The incident happened on Ravenshill Road, in the Yardley Wood area of Birmingham.  </p>

<p>Birmingham City Council arrived at the scene a short time later and removed the rubbish</p>

<p>Residents complained the dumped waste was a danger to children and vulnerable pedestrians</p>
