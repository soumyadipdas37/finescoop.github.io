<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kai Havertz has missed Bayer Leverkusen's performance tests over the weekend as he closes in on a transfer to Chelsea, according to Bild.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old did attend the club's headquarters on Friday and Saturday as he reported for two coronavirus tests, as he is required to carry them out for his upcoming national team matches with Germany.</p>

<p>Chelsea have been pursuing the attacking midfielder for some time, as they continue to spend big in their summer rebuild under manager Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz missed Bayer Leverkusen's performance tests as he closes in on Chelsea transfer</p>

<p>The 21-year-old did attend the club's headquarters as he reported for two coronavirus tests</p>

<p>Earlier in the window, fellow Germany team-mate Timo Werner made the switch from RB Leipzig to Stamford Bridge, with Havertz reportedly taking baby steps closer to following him.</p>

<p>The Blues recently added Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell to their growing list of new signings, as the England international made a £50million move to London.</p>

<p>They also announced the signing of Thiago Silva, formally of PSG, on a free transfer from PSG, as well as French defender Malang Sarr.</p>

<p>Chelsea have made progress in their pursuit of Havertz as they try to agree a transfer fee</p>

<p>However, Sarr could be heading straight off to Germany on loan to long-term admirers Bayer Leverkusen in a sweetener to help Chelsea get a deal for Havertz over the line.</p>

<p>The German wonderkid is set to cost Chelsea around £90million, with the finer details of the deal being the biggest negotiating factor in the drawn out transfer saga.</p>

<p>The Premier League side were hoping to secure Havertz' signature for £70million, but Leverkusen stuck by their £90m valuation.  </p>

<p>Aston Villa asked about Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham but the star is keen to stay at the club</p>

<p>Elsewhere, Chelsea striker Tammy Abraham has attracted interest from his former loanee club Aston Villa but remains determined to battle with Werner for a first-team spot at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Abraham scored 26 goals for the Midlands outfit and helped fire them to top-flight promotion in 2019, but has enjoyed a successful breakthrough campaign with Chelsea.</p>

<p>The youngster is keen to once again prove his first-team credentials in west London and looks set to turn down any advances made this summer.  </p>
