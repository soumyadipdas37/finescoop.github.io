<p>Linking the human brain to a computer is usually the work of science fiction writers and filmmakers, but moves are underway to make the technology a reality. </p>

<p>Last month, Elon Musk hosted a high-profile event where he spoke about the developments with his own version of brain chip technology, Neuralink. </p>

<p>However, innovation in the field is being held back by the high cost and the length of time it can take to develop prototype implants. </p>

<p>3D printing offers a customisable, quick and cheap option which could revolutionise the burgeoning industry. </p>

<p>Researchers say that being able to 3D print the neural implants they could better treat a range of nervous system conditions, including paralysis </p>

<p>Scientists suggest that in the future, the implant could be printed in the operating theatre while the patient is being prepped</p>

<p>Elon Musk gave the first look of Neuralink's 'Link' device last month, saying 'it will blow your mind' – but many who tuned into the livestream are saying just the opposite.</p>

<p>Leading up to the demonstration, Musk promised to show neurons firing in a living brain, leading many to believe a human would be the subject – but instead viewers saw the brain activity of a pig.</p>

<p>The Tesla and SpaceX CEO also made claims that the device will one-day cure debilitating illnesses and mental disorders, along with creating a brain-computer interface. </p>

<p>Neuroscientists criticised the technology because recording neural signals is 'decades old,' while the public is sure the billionaire is taking Netflix's series 'Black Mirror' too seriously.</p>

<p>In the new study, researchers used a multi-layer, soft chip to stimulate the damaged spinal cord of cats, rats and zebrafish.   </p>

<p>The study also shows the chip is effective on the surface of the brain, peripheral nerves and muscles.</p>

<p>While the spinal cord remains the primary focus, the technology could allow for therapeutic developments for conditions affecting these tissues.</p>

<p>Professor Ivan Minev, one of authors of the study from the University of Sheffield, says the research demonstrates how 3D printing can be benefit researchers.  </p>

<p>'The power of 3D printing means the prototype implants can be quickly changed and reproduced again as needed to help drive forward research and innovation in neural interfaces,' he says. </p>

<p>He also suggests that, in the future, the implant could be printed in the operating theatre while the patient is being prepped.   </p>

<p>The vision relies on implants that can sense and supply tiny electrical impulses in the brain and the nervous system, the experts said.   </p>

<p>Using the new technique, a neuroscientist can order a custom design which can feed instructions to the printer.  </p>

<p>Findings have been published in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. </p>
