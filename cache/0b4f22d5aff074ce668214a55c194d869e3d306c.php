<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds United have agreed an agreement in principle for the transfer of Diego Llorente from Real Sociedad.</p>

<p>The Spanish club tweeted out the announcement, as well as a farewell video showing off some of the defender's highlights.    </p>

<p>The exact specifics have not yet been revealed, but earlier on Tuesday, Leeds were thought to be closing in on a deal worth up to £20million. </p>

<p>Defender Diego Llorente is on the brink of joining Leeds from Real Sociedad for £20million </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Marcelo Bielsa will use Llorente as cover or a starter</p>

<p>Llorente will be the second Spain international to join in the window with the club having already secured Rodrigo from Valencia.</p>

<p>Llorente, capped five times by his country, has not always convinced regarding his consistency but Leeds hope his experience can help their young squad.</p>

<p>Robin Koch and Liam Cooper are Marcelo Bielsa's first-choice centre-back pairing so it will be interesting to see where Llorente fits in.</p>

<p>Llorente has plenty of experience and has been capped by Spain on five occasions </p>

<p>Llorente spent the early part of his career at Real Madrid, but only made three appearances for the first team. </p>

<p>Instead he often played in youth squads or out on loan at Rayo Vallecano and Malaga.</p>

<p>He joined Real Sociedad in 2017, and has since made 88 appearances for the club, scoring eight goals in that time. </p>
