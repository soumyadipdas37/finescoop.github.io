<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>While Jose Mourinho managed to salvage Tottenham Hotspur's 2019-20 season following a dreadful start under Mauricio Pochettino, there were still holes for the Portuguese coach to plug. </p>

<p>Spurs were in 14th place in the Premier League table when Mourinho took over, with 'The Special One' guiding them to a sixth-place finish come the end of the season at the end of July. </p>

<p>Despite this minor success, Mourinho knows he can get more out of this group of players and has once again turned to the transfer market to turn Spurs back into top-four challengers and possibly even beyond.  </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has made some shrewd signings for Tottenham Hotspur in this summer window</p>

<p>Spurs have added midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg (left) and Joe Hart (right) to their ranks</p>

<p>The acquisitions of goalkeeper Joe Hart on a free transfer, Wolves defender Matt Doherty and Southampton midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg so far can be seen as smart purchases who will bring in a clear culture that Mourinho wants to instill in this Tottenham team.</p>

<p>That culture is a title-winning one. Yet it is one which Spurs clearly lack and it lets them down on the big stage. The north Londoners have failed to win a trophy since the 2008 League Cup title, which in itself was their first major honour in 21 years. </p>

<p>It means despite the talent Harry Kane, Dele Alli and Hugo Lloris bring to the table, their lack of trophy-winning experience at club level will always hold them and Spurs back. </p>

<p>With 25 trophies as a manager, Mourinho can go somewhere to help the drought - but it isn't enough. He needs the players to show the same bottle he has shown on the touchline for the past 15 years. </p>

<p>Wolves right-back Matt Doherty has also joined Mourinho's squad for the 2020-21 season</p>

<p>Spurs players who have won league titles in their careers:</p>

<p>Davinson Sanchez - 4</p>

<p>Toby Aldeweireld - 4</p>

<p>Lucas Moura - 4</p>

<p>Joe Hart - 3</p>

<p>Steven Bergwijn - 3</p>

<p>Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg - 2</p>

<p>Matt Doherty - 2</p>

<p>Giovani Lo Celso - 1</p>

<p>Gedson Fernandes - 1 </p>

<p>Rest of the squad - 0</p>

<p>(Bold indicates player signed by Jose Mourinho at Tottenham Hotspur)</p>

<p>This mission to get more title winners in the Spurs squad cannot be more clearly visible than through the signing of Hart, whose influence are more likely to be used in the dressing room rather than between the sticks.</p>

<p>The England international, who appears to have been brought in as Spurs' third-choice shot stopper, won three league titles with Manchester City - but most importantly shared a dressing room with the likes of Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero and David Silva.  </p>

<p>Throughout his career, Hart has been a winner and the recycling of those title-winning conversations and leadership skills could be key to Spurs' success even if he does not play too much. </p>

<p>Yet Hart is not the only new face that Mourinho has brought in to fix this issue. Out of the nine Spurs players to have won a league title in their respective careers, five have been purchased by the Portuguese manager. </p>

<p>In January, Mourinho signed Gedson Fernandes and Steven Bergwijn, who have both won the top-flight in Portugal and Holland respectively in their careers. </p>

<p>Now he has added right-back Doherty, who won the Championship and League One titles with Wolves. And Hojbjerg featured for Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich side for three seasons - winning the Bundesliga twice. He also won two league cups and the Champions League during his time in Germany.</p>

<p>Hart (right) will bring much-needed title-winning experience from his time at Manchester City</p>

<p>Doherty is an attacking full-back - he has 15 goals and 15 assists in his last two years at Wolves</p>

<p>There are tactical elements to these signings too. Doherty is an excellent fit to the asymmetrical formation that Mourinho has employed at the north London club.</p>

<p>Left-back Ben Davies likes to tuck inside and form a back-three with the two centre-backs, leaving the right-back to push on and support the attack without defensive responsibilities.  </p>

<p>That high-flying right-back role was taken by Serge Aurier last season, but the Ivorian's wastefulness in the final third, along with his inability to track back and defend, meant Mourinho had to find an alternative option.</p>

<p>At Wolves, Doherty held a similar role - albeit as a wing-back in a 3-4-3 formation under Nuno Espirito Santo - and the Irishman has scored 15 goals and registered 15 assists in all competitions since Wolves were promoted to the Premier League two years ago.  </p>

<p>Hojbjerg (right) made more tackles and covered more ground than any Spurs player last term</p>

<p>The necessity to fix Spurs' defensive midfield issue is the reason why Mourinho and Daniel levy have invested £25million in Hojbjerg. Eric Dier was sub-standard in the role and is now used as a defender, while Tanguy Ndombele and Harry Winks have showed promise but are too inconsistent for Mourinho.</p>

<p>Yet Hojbjerg brings something different to Spurs in his role as a fixed ball-winning midfielder. The former Bayern Munich man ran 284.17km in the top-flight last season - more than any other Spurs player. </p>

<p>That statistic is even more impressive given the fact that the Danish midfielder started just one of Southampton's last seven matches last term after he was stripped of the Saints captaincy by Ralph Hasenhuttl due to speculation about his future.</p>

<p>Mourinho's new signings may not be glamorous - but they can certainly make a difference</p>

<p>The 27-year-old also ranked 17th in the league for tackles (80) last term which shows his ability to regularly win the ball back in the middle of the park.  </p>

<p>The signings of Hart, Hojbjerg are not the glamorous names Spurs fans would have wanted - but it is important to remember Mourinho has brought them in for a reason.</p>

<p>If Spurs go on to claim a trophy during the Portuguese coach's first full season in charge - they may just be the most important buys the club have made in years. </p>
