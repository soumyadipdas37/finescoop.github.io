<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>South Koreans returned to gyms and coffee shops today as the country eased social distancing rules for two weeks after a decline in cases. </p>

<p>After suppressing an early Covid-19 surge with extensive testing and tracing, South Korea has battled several spikes in recent weeks, mainly in the Seoul region which is home to half the country's 52million people. </p>

<p>But new cases have fallen to around 100 per day compared to a peak of more than 400 in a day in late August, meaning restrictions can be loosened. </p>

<p>Starting this week, coffee chops can resume sit-down service while restaurants and bakeries are returning to normal hours - but tougher measures will return ahead of a three-day national holiday in late September and early October. </p>

<p>Infections in South Korea have been dropping again after a summer spike which brought the worst single-day increases since March </p>

<p>In the early days of the pandemic, South Korea was one of the first countries outside China to be heavily affected, with nearly 3,000 cases in the month of February. </p>

<p>While the crisis spiralled out of control in Europe and the Americas in March and April, South Korea brought the epidemic to a near-standstill with a widely-praised testing and tracing scheme.</p>

<p>Cases started picking up again in late summer, with infections rising by nearly 300 per cent from July to August, leading to new restrictions.</p>

<p>The 441 new cases on August 27 were the most since March, but cases have slowed since then with only 106 new positive tests announced today, the fewest in a month. </p>

<p>Seoul was responsible for 32 of today's new cases, while another 39 were in the Gyeonggi-do region which surrounds the capital.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, deaths remain low with only 367 fatalities since the start of the pandemic - although there have been 43 in the last two weeks compared to 18 in the previous fortnight. </p>

<p>Around 3,100 people are currently in quarantine in South Korea, with nearly 400 released from isolation in the last 24 hours.  </p>

<p>Prime minister Chung Sye-kyun told a government meeting on Sunday that measures would be eased in the Seoul metropolitan area for two weeks.   </p>

<p>'We're not in a situation to relax yet but the effect of tightened quarantine measures has been showing little by little,' he said.</p>

<p>'The number of daily infections is still not dropping to double-digits and it isn't yet a situation where measures can be significantly relaxed, as one out of four people's path of transmission is untraceable.' </p>

<p>The easing means that franchise coffee shops can resume normal operations after previously being limited to takeaways.  </p>

<p>Restaurants and bakeries will return to normal hours, while indoor gyms and hagwons - private cram schools - can open their doors again. </p>

<p>But Chung warned of tougher social distancing rules during the Chuseok holiday - the Korean harvest festival - from September 30 to October 2. </p>

<p>Chuseok is one of the country's biggest holidays with millions travelling across the country to visit family in the nation's largest annual migration.</p>

<p>Although officials had earlier asked the public to skip the annual tradition, local reports said hotels at popular vacation spots were fully booked for the holiday.</p>

<p>'The long weekend is forecast to be the biggest crisis for quarantine efforts against Covid-19 in the second half of the year,' Chung said.</p>

<p>Restrictions on large gatherings will remain, with nightclubs and karaoke bars still closed, authorities said.</p>

<p>Indoor gatherings are limited to 50 people and outdoor gatherings to 100, while spectators are banned from sporting events.  </p>

<p>In addition, restaurants and cafes are still required to restrict seating and take their customers' names and contact details.  </p>
