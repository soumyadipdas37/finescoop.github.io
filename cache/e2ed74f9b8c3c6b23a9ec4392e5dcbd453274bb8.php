<p>Mr Andrews used an old snap of a 2018 visit to Chisolm TAFE in a post spruiking his education agenda on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The picture, which was posted to his Facebook page followed by one million people, shows the premier smiling alongside Emily Roberts and Jack Sharlassian.</p>

<p>But the pair have been left furious at being associated with Mr Andrews because they have both lost their jobs during his 15-week lockdown of Melbourne. </p>

<p>In a comment on the post, Ms Roberts wrote: 'I'm the female apprentice standing next to Dan and all I can say is... this photo was taken two years ago and why you dragging me into this now brah?!</p>

<p>'I'm not your friend! I'm not even working (due to coronavirus lockdown in Melbourne)'.</p>

<p>Mr Sharlassian, a plumbing apprentice in his final year, has also lost his job due to the coronavirus-caused recession.</p>

<p>Emily Roberts (circled) replied to the post with a furious  response</p>

<p>He told Daily Mail Australia: 'I've been laid off as well due to lockdown. I'm not too impressed with the pic. It seems like a joke.' </p>

<p>Mr Sharlassian said the premier has gone too far with his coronavirus restrictions which keep Melburnians locked up at home for 22 hours of the day.</p>

<p>They will remain in place until 19 October even though fewer than 20 cases have been recorded each day for the past week. </p>

<p>Victoria's second wave began in May when coronavirus escaped from two quarantine hotels and spread rapidly around the city.</p>

<p>Melbourne was placed into lockdown on 8 July and a curfew was imposed preventing residents from leaving home after 8pm, although that was removed earlier this week.</p>

<p>The federal treasury estimated the second lockdown would cost 400,000 jobs by Christmas. </p>

<p>On Wednesday private security guards were pulled from a Melbourne quarantine hotel and replaced by police after a health worker raised fears about infection control breaches.</p>

<p>Guards employed by a services company were sent home from the Novotel in Southbank half way through their shift.</p>

<p>The state government took action after an anonymous health worker at the hotel tipped off a local newspaper with claims that infection control protocols were not being followed.   </p>

<p>Melbourne is not accepting international travellers but hotel quarantine is still being used to isolate coronavirus patients who cannot isolate at home. </p>

<p>Opposition leader Michael O'Brien slammed the government for continuing to use private security guards. </p>

<p>'This hopeless Labor government has learnt nothing from its hotel quarantine scandal that's already killed 781 Victorians,' he wrote. </p>

<p>'They're still using private guards not up to the task. Andrews must go - his toxic mix of arrogance and incompetence is destroying Victoria.'</p>

<p>Victoria reported two more deaths and 15 infections overnight. </p>
