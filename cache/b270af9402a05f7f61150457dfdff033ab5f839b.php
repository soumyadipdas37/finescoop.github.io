<p>'Everybody knew the R rate was going to go higher because everybody kept coming out the house,' Adam, who plays for Dundee in the second-tier of Scottish football, began. </p>

<p>'There's got to be a point where we've got to move on and... I understand it's getting higher. It will get higher because there's so many people out now.</p>

<p>'But if we're going to shut down football, let's just shut down pubs, restaurants - everything again and the economy will go bust.'</p>

<p>Scottish Premiership teams are in a testing bubble with two checks each week, but this does not apply to the Scottish Championship, League One or League Two. </p>

<p>However, when questioned about whether he feels comfortable playing amongst players not regularly tested, Adam was unequivocal. </p>

<p>'No. I'm fine. I'm happy. I'm playing. That doesn't bother me,' Adam stated.</p>

<p>The 34-year-old revealed coronavirus does not come into his mind when playing football </p>

<p>'Covid does not come into my mind. It's all about playing football. Because that's my job, that's the excitement, that's the buzz I get from it.</p>

<p>'And do you know? If I pick the virus up, then ok, - I'll deal with that.</p>

<p>'I'll have to isolate and things like that... but I'm not worried. I'm young, I'm healthy, that's how I feel. Everybody might be different...' </p>
