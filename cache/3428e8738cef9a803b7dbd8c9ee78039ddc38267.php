<p>Kmart Australia has launched a new website feature that allows customers to see how products look in their homes before purchasing them.</p>

<p>Using augmented reality (AR) technology, customers can use their phones to choose from a range of furniture, home décor and bedding products to visualise and view how the products will look.</p>

<p>Unlike virtual reality (VR) that requires headsets to be worn and immerses the user in a digital location, augmented reality brings the digital into the real world through phone cameras.</p>

<p>The technology is easy to use and is helpful in order to see whether certain products will fit in a space or if it matches other objects in the room</p>

<p>Customers can access the feature through the k-labs page on the Kmart website and use their phones to choose products and digitally place them in their homes.</p>

<p>The digitalised items can be moved and turned in order to fit in the desired place in a room.</p>

<p>Currently on the site shoppers can choose from Kmart's popular rattan cupboards along with side tables, lamps, cushions and ottomans.</p>

<p>The technology is easy to use and is helpful in order to see whether certain products will fit in a space or if it matches other objects in the room.</p>

<p>It will also assist those who are looking to redecorate and style their homes differently.    </p>

<p>A KBot assistant is available to provide shoppers with product dimensions, colour and material details. </p>

<p>Prices are also listed beside the image of each product.  </p>

<p>'The immersive AR and AI experience was designed to bring joy and inspiration to customers' lives,' said Kmart head of digital Melissa Wong.</p>

<p>'With extra help from our AI chatbot personality – KBot assist – we have been able to make shopping easier for customers by sprinkling delight across the customer journey,' she said.</p>
