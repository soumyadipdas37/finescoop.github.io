<p>Neymar and Alvaro Gonzalez have continued their war of words on social media on Monday</p>

<p>The Brazilian was one of five players sent off in a feisty derby between PSG and Marseille </p>

<p>The 28-year-old alleges that Gonzalez called him a 'monkey motherf*****', which infuriated the £208m star and resulted in him throwing a punch at his rival. </p>

<p>The Spaniard responded to the allegation on social media, labelling Neymar a 'bad loser' before the Brazilian responded to Gonzalez's denial of the allegation. </p>

<p>'There is no place for racism... Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field. Incredible 3 points today. Allez l'OM. Thanks family,' Gonzalez tweeted alongside a picture of himself with his team-mates.</p>

<p>Neymar protested after his dismissal, alleging that Gonzalez had racially abused him</p>

<p>He was caught on camera throwing a punch at the Spanish defender during the game </p>

<p>'You are not a man to assume your mistake, losing is part of the sport. Now insulting and bringing racism into our lives no, I don't agree,' Neymar responded on Twitter.</p>

<p>'I DON'T RESPECT YOU! YOU HAVE NO CHARACTER! Assume what you say mermon ... be a MAN RAPÁ! RACIST'.</p>
