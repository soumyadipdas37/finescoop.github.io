<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former California sheriff’s deputy who pleaded guilty to having sex with the 16-year-old son of her ex-boyfriend has been sentenced to a year in jail.</p>

<p>Shauna Bishop, 46, was a Sacramento County sheriff’s deputy in April 2019, shortly after she ended a yearlong relationship with a man who also worked for the department.</p>

<p>The man told his ex-wife that he was uncomfortable with the way Bishop behaved around their 16-year-old son, according to The Mercury News.</p>

<p>But the ex-wife had been on friendly terms with Bishop, who was invited to her home to speak to the boy about his drinking and marijuana use, according to court documents.</p>

<p>On April 28, 2019, Bishop was invited to spend the night at the ex-wife’s home.</p>

<p>Shauna Bishop, 46, was sentenced to a year in jail after she pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual conduct with a minor</p>

<p>Bishop admitted to having a sexual encounter with the 16-year-old son of a man she dated. The encounter took place in April 2019</p>

<p>After the mother fell asleep, Bishop went to the boy’s room and engaged in intercourse and oral sex with him, according to authorities.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, the boy told his 19-year-old sister, who then told her mother. The mother then notified Folsom police.</p>

<p>Bishop told investigators that she was under the influence of Ambien, a sedative used to treat insomnia.</p>

<p>Both Bishop and the boy’s mother took Ambien before going to bed that night, according to authorities.</p>

<p>When the investigation began in May 2019, Bishop was placed on administrative leave. Soon afterward, she resigned.</p>

<p>Bishop resigned from the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department last year</p>

<p>In June 2019, Bishop was arrested.</p>

<p>As part of a plea agreement, she agreed to plead guilty in July to unlawful sexual conduct with a minor.</p>

<p>In exchange, prosecutors agreed to dismiss four other charges.</p>

<p>In addition to jail time, Bishop will be placed on five years probation and have to perform 180 hours of community service.</p>

<p>She will also be required to register as a sex offender. </p>
