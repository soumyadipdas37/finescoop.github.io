<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sony's PlayStation 5 will be launched on November 20, according to an alleged leak by Amazon Japan.   </p>

<p>Amazon accidentally listed and then removed the console's release date, Gizmodo Japan first reported.</p>

<p>Sony's official word on when PS5 will come out isn't more specific than 'late 2020', even though it officially revealed the console back in June. </p>

<p>The leak comes a couple of days after gaming rival Microsoft revealed the release date for its fourth generation consoles, the Series X and Series S – November 10. </p>

<p>Sony revealed the full design for the PlayStation 5 back in June but it's still yet to reveal an official word regarding a release date</p>

<p>The screenshot by Gizmodo Japan, showing a November 20 release date for the PS5 and accessories </p>

<p>PlayStation 5 and its related accessories go on sale on November 20, Gizmodo Japan's screen captures show. </p>

<p>'Related products are still accepting reservations on Amazon.co.jp,' the site says.</p>

<p>'Somehow, I think it's very reasonable in terms of time.'  </p>

<p>It's already known that PlayStation 5 will be available in two models – one with a standard a disc drive and a second, 'PlayStation 5 Digital Edition,' without a disc drive.</p>

<p>The latter will likely only play games downloaded over the internet but not physical discs bought in stores.</p>

<p>Both will allow 'lightning-fast loading' and deeper immersion with support for haptic feedback, which applies vibrations to the gamer to match the gameplay.    </p>

<p>As well as the new console, Sony took the opportunity to announce a redesigned controller and a host of accessories, including a wireless charging station for its DualSense controllers, a media remote control, PlayStation-branded over-the-ear headphones with 3D audio support and a new HD Camera with dual 1080p lenses</p>

<p>PS5 accessories include a wireless charging station for its DualSense controllers, a media remote control for those who want to use it to stream video and PlayStation-branded over-the-ear headphones with 3D audio support.</p>

<p>The console will feature an 8-coreA MD Zen 2 CPU, a powerful AMD RNDA 2 graphics processor, 3D audio output and a speedy solid-state drive that will help games load faster.  </p>

<p>Sony also unveiled a range of new games, including entries in familiar franchises such as Resident Evil Village, Gran Turismo 7, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, Horizon 2: Forbidden West, and Spider-Man: Miles Morales. </p>

<p>PS5 owners will get an online multiplayer Grand Theft Auto Online completely free at launch. </p>

<p>When the PS5 is released this holiday season, it will find itself up against Microsoft's fourth-generation Xbox range, which consists of the Series X and slimmer, cheaper Series S.  </p>

<p>The flagship Xbox Series X is priced at £449, while the compact version, the Xbox Series S, will retail at £249. </p>

<p>Both the Xbox Series X (left) and Series S (right) will be available on November 10. Pre-orders for both begin September 22</p>

<p>Both will launch November 10, Microsoft confirmed on Wednesday, and pre-orders begin on September 22.</p>

<p>The devices will also be made available through its Xbox All Access programme, allowing players to split the cost across 24 months from £20.99 a month. </p>

<p>Microsoft has said the Series X is the most powerful console it has ever made – featuring processing power twice that of the current generation Xbox One X. </p>

<p>The fourth generation Xbox consoles have backwards compatibility, which allows them to play games from older consoles. </p>

<p>The feature means gamers will have access to thousands of titles across four generations of content – from the original Xbox, released in 2001, to 2005's Xbox 360 and 2013's Xbox One. </p>
