<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England, Scotland and Wales today recorded another 33 coronavirus deaths between them in the preliminary toll as Britain's fatality toll continues to creep up.</p>

<p>Health officials have yet to confirm the final daily figure, which takes into account data from every setting across the UK. The early count for England only includes laboratory-confirmed victims in NHS-ran hospitals.</p>

<p>NHS England today revealed another 30 patients had died after testing positive for Covid-19, including one victim who was no older than 19. Scotland and Wales announced two and one fatality, respectively. None were recorded in Northern Ireland.  </p>

<p>Government figures show deaths are finally rising in line with cases, which began to spiral earlier this month. On average, 25 Britons are now succumbing to the illness each day, almost double the rate of 13 last week. It had dropped to a low of seven at the start of September.</p>

<p>The Department of Health will offer a full update on cases and deaths later this afternoon. Yesterday saw another 6,178 infections recorded — showing the outbreak has risen 37 per cent in the space of a week. </p>

<p>The figure was, technically, the second-highest amount of cases ever recorded in a 24-hour spell in Britain. But it is impossible to compare infections now to numbers recorded during the first wave because only fewer than 20,000 people were being swabbed on the darkest days in March and April, compared to around 230,000 now.   </p>

<p>But one expert today claimed the actual number of cases occurring each day in England now may be three times greater than what official figures show. Dr Julian Tang, a respiratory disease expert at the University of Leicester, said the UK's coronavirus testing regime may only pick up a third of cases in the community due to people being asymptomatic. His estimate would mean the true number of daily infections is around the 18,000 mark.</p>

<p>Dr Tang said findings from the Real-Time Assessment of Community Transmission study, a large population survey examining the prevalence of coronavirus in England, showed that 'up to two-thirds (60-70 per cent) of Covid-19 cases may be asymptomatic'. Other studies have revealed it may actually be as low as 20 per cent.</p>

<p>Test and Trace figures released today also revealed the number of positive cases has now plateaued, after almost doubling the week before. More than 19,000 infected patients were transferred to the system in the week ending September 16, up just 3 per cent on the 18,770 in the previous seven-day spell — which was up on the 10,491 from the week before that. </p>

<p>England, Wales and Scotland today posted 27 more Covid-19 deaths while Northern Ireland recorded none in the preliminary toll</p>
