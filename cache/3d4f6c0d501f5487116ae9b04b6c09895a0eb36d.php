<p>As reported by The Sun, United are concerned about the financial impact of a second wave of coronavirus.</p>

<p>United retain a strong interest in the England winger but don't want to pay such a significant fee.</p>

<p>Manchester United are unwilling to match Borussia Dortmund's asking price for Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Many Premier League clubs are concerned about the possibility of a new lockdown in addition to the continued uncertainty regarding when supporters will return to stadiums.</p>

<p>With infection rates continuing to rise, fears are growing about the impact on football.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side are unwilling to pay £100m due to fears over a second lockdown</p>

<p>Midfielder Donny van de Beek is the only major arrival at United so far in this transfer window</p>

<p>United signed Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40million but haven't conducted any other transfer business during this window. </p>

<p>Bringing in Sancho, who has scored 34 goals and provided 43 assists in 99 appearances for Dortmund, would certainly boost United.</p>

<p>However, in the current circumstances it is difficult for them to finance such a deal.</p>
