<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Astrazeneca has struck a deal to mass-produce a potential Covid-19 vaccine, as it begins large-scale human trials in the US.</p>

<p>The FTSE 100 drugs firm will pay gene therapy group Oxford Biomedica £15million up front to scale up manufacturing capacity of the vaccine, as it hopes to win fast-track approval in the US, and plans to enrol up to 30,000 test candidates.</p>

<p>Astrazeneca's shot, developed in collaboration with researchers at Oxford University, is one of the most promising vaccinations under way. </p>

<p>Vaccine deal: Astrazeneca will pay gene therapy group Oxford Biomedica £15m up front to scale up manufacturing capacity of the vaccine</p>

<p>Experts hope it will halt the spread of coronavirus, which has already killed more than 850,000 people.</p>

<p>A final-stage trial is in progress in the UK, and reports have emerged that the US may be aiming for approval before the November presidential election.</p>

<p>Astrazeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot said: 'We are moving quickly but without cutting corners, and regulators have clear and stringent efficacy and safety standards for the approval of any new medicine, and that includes this potential Covid-19 vaccine.'</p>

<p>Oxford Biomedica said it expected to receive more than £35million more if the vaccine was successful, as it manufactures large batches of the vaccine until the end of 2021.</p>

<p>Already the UK has bought 100m doses of the vaccines, while the European Union has bought 300m. Astrazeneca shares fell 1.7 per cent, or 143p, to 8197p.</p>
