<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boxing superstar Canelo Alvarez has filed a complaint against his promoter Oscar De La Hoya, Golden Boy Promotions and DAZN, according to reports.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old Mexican made the move on Tuesday in Los Angeles federal court - alleging that there was a breach of contract.</p>

<p>According to The Athletic, Alvarez is at war with his promoter and the streaming service, DAZN, over his multi-million 10-fight boxing contract.</p>

<p>Canelo Alvarez is at loggerheads with his promoter and DAZN over his 10-fight contract</p>

<p>Back in October 2018, Alvarez put pen to paper on a a 10-fight deal worth $350million (£270m) with DAZN but just two bouts into that contract - he is at odds with both the streaming service and De La Hoya over payment of his set $35m (£27m) per contest.</p>

<p>'I'm the pound-for-pound No. 1 in the world,' Alvarez said in a statement to The Athletic. </p>

<p>'I'm not scared of any opponent in the ring, and I'm not going to let failures of my broadcaster or promoters keep me out of the ring.</p>

<p>'I filed the lawsuit so I can get back to boxing and give my fans the show they deserve.' </p>

<p>It has been reported that DAZN have already been reluctant to pay Alvarez his full fight purse after just two bouts - instead offering him roughly half as much.</p>

<p>Alvarez has filed a complaint against Oscar De La Hoya, Golden Boy Promotions and DAZN</p>

<p>The streaming service argue that four-weight world champion Alvarez has failed to seal a mega-fight with one of boxing's biggest opponents.</p>

<p>They have been digging in their heels over Golden Boy's failure to deliver a money-spinning trilogy fight with Gennady Golovkin. </p>

<p>But after rejecting DAZN's offer of half the fight purse, he subsequently turned to Golden Boy to find a new broadcaster to deal with.</p>

<p>However, it has been alleged that his promoter failed to negotiate a new deal and are now part of the lawsuit as well.</p>

<p>Alvarez is also looking for damages at a minimum of $280m (£216m). </p>

<p>Almost two years ago, Alvarez penned a 10-fight deal with DAZN worth $350million (£270m)</p>
