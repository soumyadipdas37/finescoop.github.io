<p>Iconic name: Bey's mom Tina Knowles-Lawson, 66, recently revealed a surprising story behind her daughter's name, one that's since launched an empire</p>

<p>Origin story: Tina told Heather Thomson on the podcast In My Head: 'A lot of people don't know that Beyoncé is my last name. It’s my maiden name' (pictured in February, 2018)</p>

<p>Racist misspelling: She revealed that she and her brother were the only ones with the surname, as the hospital misspelled the family's name Beyincé on their birth certificates</p>

<p>'My name was Celestine Beyoncé, which at that time was not a cool thing to have that weird name. I wanted my name to be Linda Smith because those were the cool names.'</p>

<p>She revealed that she and her brother were the only ones with the surname, as the hospital misspelled the family's name Beyincé on their birth certificates.</p>

<p>The House of Deréon co-founder detailed the subsequent conversation with her mom: 'So I said, "Well, why didn't you argue and make them correct it?"</p>

<p>'And she said, "I did one time. The first time, and I was told be happy that you're getting a birth certificate because, at one time, Black people didn't get birth certificates."'</p>
