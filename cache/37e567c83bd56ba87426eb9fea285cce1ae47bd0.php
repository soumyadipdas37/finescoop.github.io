<p>Friends say Jeffrey Mumper had beaten prostate cancer and was battling pancreatic cancer, according to WTHR. </p>

<p>Jakob was an elite swimmer and senior at Bloomington North High School who was set to break several school records this season.</p>

<p>Police discovered the bodies on Sunday at the Mumper's family home in Bloomington, Indiana</p>

<p>'Those were my records from when I went through. So, to have coached someone who's now better than me, that's kind of what you really want as a coach. So, it's a tough loss on so many levels, the athletics being one of the lesser levels for sure,' Bloomington High School North boys swimming coach Max Irwin said.</p>

<p>Friends also say Annemarie Greta wanted to become a teacher and drove a school bus with the hopes of one day achieving her dream. </p>
