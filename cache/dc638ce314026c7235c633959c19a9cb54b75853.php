<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Southgate will hold heart-to-heart talks with Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden before deciding whether to axe the shamed duo from his next England squad.</p>

<p>The youngsters were kicked out of the squad on Monday morning as it emerged they arranged a secret rendezvous with two Icelandic models at the team hotel in Reykjavik on Sunday night.</p>

<p>England and Southgate's immediate concern was the breach of Covid protocols - but speaking after Tuesday's draw in Denmark the national team manager admitted the pair would have been sent home anyway because of their behaviour.</p>

<p>England manager Gareth Southgate is to hold talks with Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden</p>

<p>Greenwood and Foden (pictured) broke protocols and have been fined after they snuck girls into their hotel room in Iceland, breaking their Covid-19 bubble</p>

<p>The controversy has cast doubt over Manchester United forward Greenwood and Manchester City midfielder Foden's positions in Southgate's forthcoming squads leading up to next summer's European Championships given the disciplinary breach.</p>

<p>Southgate will hold talks with Football Association officials before making a decision on their immediate international futures, but sources claim that the England boss will not consider either for next month's games against Belgium, Wales and Denmark.</p>

<p>Similarly, Southgate has revealed he will seek out the pair for talks as he decides how to resolve the situation ahead of his squad announcement for October's international matches.</p>

<p>Southgate said: 'I obviously have to think through lots of conversations that need to happen. Trust can be built in many different ways.</p>

<p>'I need to spend time (with them) because I don't know the two boys well. I need to spend time to understand all of that situation far better than I had time to speak on Monday.</p>

<p>There have been suggestions that the pair could be dropped from Southgate's next squad</p>

<p>Southgate has revealed his concerns about fixture congestion during the upcoming season</p>

<p>'I literally had 10 minutes before training, and five minutes before we left, for something as significant as we've been through. That isn't an adequate opportunity to really sit and talk things through.' United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and City manager Pep Guardiola will also speak with their respective youngsters in the coming days.</p>

<p>Both clubs are said to be focused on protecting their players from further public criticism rather than looking condemning them further for their breaches of discipline.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Southgate has revealed his concerns at how the forthcoming season's congested schedule will impact on his preparations for the next summer's European Championships and England's World Cup qualification campaign which starts in March.</p>

<p>'It won't be an easy nine months. March, in particular, will be very complicated regarding the World Cup qualifiers,' added Southgate.</p>
