<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>All 20 Premier League clubs are set to approve plans to allow all top-flight matches to be shown live on TV this season until at least October 1, according to reports.</p>

<p>Out of the first 28 games of the 2020-21 season, 11 matches are currently not going to be shown on television, with fans currently banned from entering football stadiums.</p>

<p>Some top-flight clubs, the UK Government and football suppporters have put pressure on England's major football league to eradicate the 3pm blackout on football matches once again in order to allow fans watch their teams.</p>

<p>The Premier League are set to allow all top-flight matches until October 1 to be shown on TV</p>

<p>And according to The Sun, Premier League chiefs and the 20 sides will give way to the pressure and allow all the behind closed doors matches to be broadcasted following a meeting on Monday.</p>

<p>This could mean some Premier League matches are given to the BBC, who were given four matches at the end of the 2019-20 season after the coronavirus hiatus. </p>

<p>Amazon Prime, who also have rights to broadcast some Premier League matches, could also be given extra games in order to help supporters watch matches. </p>

<p>This would be the second time the 3pm blackout has been scrapped in 2020, as all top-flight games were shown on TV following the Premier League's return in March. </p>

<p>11 matches in September have not picked for TV so far, but that could soon change after talks</p>

<p>The 20 Premier League clubs reportedly met on Monday to discuss the broadcasting plans</p>

<p>Some games were even shown on free-to-air channels, including on the BBC, Sky One and Sky's Pick channel.  </p>

<p>So far, TV picks have only been made for the opening three matches of the 2020-21 Premier League season. The picks were not kind to Newcastle United, who had no matches selected for TV meaning their fans are currently set to have no way of watching their start to the season. </p>

<p>The change in TV broadcasting rules could see some Premier League fixtures change. For example, Sheffield United's tie against Wolverhampton Wanderers, origninally set for 8pm on September 14, could be moved to a 6pm kick-off in order to avoid a clash with Chelsea's trip to Brighton - which is live on Sky Sports.  </p>

<p>The Government is set to allow fans to return to matches from October 1, albeit with a reduced capacity of between 15 and 35 per cent. </p>
