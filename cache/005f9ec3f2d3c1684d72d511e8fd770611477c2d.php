<p>Candid: Marion Cotillard has revealed that she found lockdown 'very interesting' as she felt 'connected' to the rest of the world</p>

<p>'I felt really connected to the rest of the world, and I think many human beings felt that way. No FOMO any more! But I also had a lot of thoughts about the world, about what's going on socially and environmentally.'</p>

<p>Marion was feeling reflective as she also discussed her recent Antarctic voyage as part of being a Greenpeace Ocean Ambassador in January.</p>

<p>The movie star was joined by Vikings star Gustaf Skarsgård and The Flowers of War actress Ni Ni for the trip of a lifetime where they researched climate change and marine life.</p>

<p>Talking about the experience, she said: 'It's definitely one of the most beautiful places I've seen in my life. It's almost untouched; its energy is really fed by the fact that you can't buy anything, you can't sell anything. </p>

<p>'But we saw a decreasing population of penguins, and plastics in a place where no man goes, so that was very disturbing. </p>

<p>'The whole trip, from pole to pole, was to try to open the public's eyes to what could happen if we don't set rules for these places.'</p>

<p>Marion noted that just weeks after the trip, the Covid-19 crisis happened, she added: 'We were there to draw attention to this project. And I came back and then it was just a couple of weeks to a different crisis.'</p>

<p>Marion revealed she started acting from a young age and it was something that was 'really strong' inside her.</p>

<p>She said: 'I was just fascinated by my parents' life. There was a lot of energy in the house, and then I started to have my own experience of acting. Right away I felt it was something that was really strong in me. </p>

<p>'The first time was in a summer camp. I did this play at the end, and I felt something that shook me. </p>

<p>'I was playing an old housekeeper and the reaction of the audience, people laughing, and then coming up to me afterwards... That was the first time I felt it would be my life.'</p>
