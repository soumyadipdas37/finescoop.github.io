<p>Living luxuriously: On Thursday, Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed the luxurious 'waste of money' she barely used  that caused her electricity bill to skyrocket to $7,000</p>

<p>'I had the underfloor heating on for three months solid through winter, never turned it off once,' she explained during segment on Thursday's Kyle and Jackie O show. </p>

<p>'In the morning I wake up, I go to the kitchen to make a cup of tea, before I put my slippers on and it's really nice to have the floor warm at that point in time.' </p>

<p>That's rich! The KIIS FM star revealed she left her under floor heating on for three months straight in her Bondi apartment. Jackie said: 'I had the under floor heating on for three months solid through winter, never turned it off once'</p>

<p>Jackie said she had no idea that the heating was so expensive. </p>

<p>'You freaked out when you saw the electricity bill.' Kyle asked.</p>

<p>'Yeah $7,000,' she replied, leaving both the shock jock and newsreader Brooklyn Ross shocked.  </p>

<p>Costly creature comforts: Jackie added that she had no idea that under floor heating was an expensive luxury. She called it a 'waste of money' because she is rarely is barefoot in her home. Pictured is Jackie with her daughter Kitty in their apartment with a puppy</p>

<p>'Yes, I died, I was like "oh my god, why is this so expensive?"' she added. </p>

<p>'Because you left it on for three months day and night?' Kyle concluded. </p>

<p>'It's like a big heater underneath the tiles, all over the house, like a house-size heater on 24/7' he added, telling his radio co-host she should have known better. </p>

<p>Bill shock! Kyle pointed out that her use of the heater only amounted to a short amount of time during the week and said: 'You freaked out when you saw the electricity bill.' 'Yeah $7,000,' she revealed, which left Kyle (pictured) and newsreader Brooklyn Ross (background) shocked</p>

<p>Jackie has since moved to an $11m home in the leafy suburb of Woollahra, which also has underfloor heating.</p>

<p>'Now I've got underfloor heating at this new place, and I haven't touched that obviously,' she joked.</p>

<p>'Give her a while, she's only been there three days,' Kyle said with a laugh. </p>

<p>'She's only been there three days': Jackie, who has since moved to an $11m home in Woollahra, which also has under floor heating, said she won't be turning on the heating feature. But Kyle joked she would have it on in no time</p>
