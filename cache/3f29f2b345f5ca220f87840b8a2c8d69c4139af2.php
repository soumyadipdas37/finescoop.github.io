<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More than six months after rain robbed them of the chance to reach the T20 World Cup final at a packed MCG, England’s women began to get the disappointment out of their system with a resounding 47-run win over West Indies.</p>

<p>This was the first of five behind-closed-doors games at Derby in 10 days — and on this evidence England must be eyeing a series victory. Tammy Beaumont got them going with a powerful 62 off 49 balls, then the bowlers strangled the tourists, who made 116 for six.</p>

<p>For England this felt like the start of a new era after a season in which the visits of South Africa and India have fallen foul of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>England batsman Tammy Beaumont hit a powerful 62 off 49 balls to guide the hosts to victory</p>

<p>The England bowlers then played their part to dismiss the West Indies 47 short of their target</p>

<p>ENGLAND: 163-8 (20 overs — Beaumont 62, Knight 25, A Jones 24; Selman 3-26, Matthews 2-25, Taylor 2-34)</p>

<p>WEST INDIES: 116-6 (20 overs — Dottin 69; Sciver 2-16, Ecclestone 2-19). </p>

<p>Beaumont, back in her favoured opening role after spending much of the early part of the year tasting little success in the middle order, hammered her first T20 half-century in 16 innings — the perfect riposte to coach Lisa Keightley’s call for more oomph in the powerplay.</p>

<p>‘It’s good to be back at the top of the order,’ said Beaumont. </p>

<p>‘I feel like I’ve been playing for my place a bit since January, which was probably fair enough. It made me look at my game, and go out there and be more aggressive.’</p>

<p>Quickfire twenties from captain Heather Knight and Amy Jones helped England to 163 for eight, though from 113 for two in the 14th over they should have done better.</p>

<p>West Indies needed 24 more than they had ever scored in a T20 game against England, and were soon in trouble. </p>

<p>Deandra Dottin responded with a fluent 69, but no one else reached double figures. </p>

<p>Katherine Brunt conceded only eight off her four overs. Game two is on Tuesday.</p>
