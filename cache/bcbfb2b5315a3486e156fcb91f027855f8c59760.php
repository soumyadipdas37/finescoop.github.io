<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fund managers in many sectors have earned their considerable salaries for those who kept faith with them since the turn of the millennium, data from an investment industry body suggests.</p>

<p>Despite the growing popularity of cheap passive or tracker funds, managed investment vehicles have outperformed benchmarks in many sectors and regions as global markets have gyrated over the last 20 years, according to figures crunched for This is Money by the Association of Investment Companies.  </p>

<p>The data also reveals that it is investment trusts that outperform their open-ended fund rivals, particularly over 20 years. The AIC represents the universe of investment trusts - the stock-market listed funds that are also known as investment companies. </p>

<p>But the AIC figures are backed up by separate data from investing platform Interactive Investor, which directly compared investment trusts with similar funds. (See tables below.) </p>

<p>The AIC ran the numbers for investment trusts and funds over the last 10 and 20 years, using total returns with dividends reinvested. The table includes some stock market indices for comparison, and as an indication of what a pure index tracker would have earned.</p>

<p>The average investment trust returned 157 per cent over 10 years and 372 per cent over 20 years, while open-ended funds earned 99 per cent and 150 per cent over the same periods. That compares to total returns for the FTSE 100 indx of 83 and 100 per cent, and for the FTSE All Share of 91 and 124 per cent. </p>

<p>Which is hardly surprising when you consider that the FTSE 100 index is currently trading about a thousand points below where it reached on New Year's Eve 1999.</p>

<p>But the FTSE All World USD benchmark showed returns of 205 and 231 per cent, while the barnstorming S&amp;P 500 shows returns  of 348 and 286 per cent when translated back into sterling.</p>

<p>So certainly, in 2010 one of the best things an investor in funds could have done would be to buy the cheapest S&amp;P 500 tracker - and keep hold of it through thick and thin. </p>

<p>In the North America sector, open-ended funds returned 302 per cent over 10 years, while investment trusts returned their holders 400 per cent over 20 years. In the North America Smaller Companies sector, trusts returned an even greater 450 per cent over the longer period.</p>

<p>The fees charged by fund managers and investment houses eat into these returns - but in comparing trusts with funds the difference is slight, with the former on average thought to be slightly cheaper. </p>

<p>It is passives and trackers that really win out on this count. But investors must pick their trackers - and betting on an index requires care, insight and luck.</p>

<p>It is in allowing the home investor exposure to more unfamiliar sectors and geographies that funds and more particularly investment trusts tend to prove their worth - while absorbing and spreading the risks of holding individual company shares. </p>

<p>Technology sector investment trusts have returned an eye-opening 652 per cent over the last 10 years. </p>

<p>In the Emerging Markets sector, trusts earned 628 per cent over 20 years, while in Asia Pacific (ex-Japan) the figure was 532 per cent. It is worth noting in both these sectors, return for ITs over the last 10 years were substantially less impressive at 64 per cent and 160 per cent. </p>

<p>Open-ended funds were more likely to match their trust cousins over 10 years, and won out in a few sectors for that timeframe. And separate data from Interactive Investor backs up the suggestion that investment trusts tend to pull away from funds with total returns over the longer term.</p>

<p>Some investment trusts, the so-called Dividend Heroes, are particularly noted for their consistency in paying a substantial income - even when dividends in the companies they hold dry up - and that can boost returns significantly, especially over long periods. </p>

<p>But because investment trusts are listed on the stock market, they are vulnerable to wider market sentiment and short-term volatility. Their share price can also diverge from their underlying or net asset value.</p>

<p>The above table shows how 'mirror' funds and trusts, which are managed by the same team, performed this year up to 10 August. In all but three cases, the fund shows either a better return or a smaller loss.</p>

<p>Over five years (above) the comparison varies more widely sector by sector - but the trust is ahead in six cases out of the 10.</p>

<p>However, over 10 years the investment trusts pull away, with only the Baillie Gifford Global Discovery Fund outdoing its mirror Edinburgh Worldwide trust, as the table below shows. The Standard Life Smaller UK Companies trust returned 298 per cent to the ASI UK Smaller Companies fund's 176 per cent.</p>

<p>Dzmitry Lipski, Head of Funds Research at Interactive Investor says that there is a 'growing body of evidence that shows they tend to outperformance over the long term'. </p>

<p>'The ability to gear, borrow money, is a structural advantage investment trusts have over funds which, for many, has turbo charged returns during the record- breaking bull market spanning over a decade,' he said. </p>

<p> 'Then Covid-19 pandemic happened, and the subsequent unprecedented lockdown measures enforced by governments over the globe sent markets into freefall. In falling markets, gearing, even a small amount, has the reverse effect: enhancing losses on the way down.</p>

<p>'Investing is intrinsically a long-term game, and as long as you have time on your side, you can ride out the inevitable bumps in the market for a smoothed return. This is not to say that investment trusts trump funds more broadly. Both instruments have their advantages and disadvantages and a place within a well-diversified portfolio.'</p>
