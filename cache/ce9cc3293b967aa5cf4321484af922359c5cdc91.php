<p>The Asian giant softshell turtle he ate is regarded as a 'high status' food and is now threatened as a direct result of human consumption</p>

<p>'Hello. I have removed my tweet about soft shell turtles &amp; eels, and apologise to all those who took offence,' he wrote online.</p>

<p>'My intent was not to promote these dishes, but to tell people about some of the foods I was offered during my recent provincial visit.'</p>

<p>Giant softshell turtles disappeared from most of their habitat last century.  </p>

<p>Some scientists describe the species as endangered, while other say it is threatened, at the very least. </p>

<p>'I certainly do not condone the harvesting of any endangered species for food or other purposes, and will be more careful about my actions in future,' Mr Kang wrote. </p>

<p>Mr Kang deleted the original tweet following the backlash, before issuing a public apology. In spite of his apology, Mr Kang's actions drew the ire of environmentalists who expressed concern about the damage he could have caused</p>

<p>Prior to holding his post with Cambodia, he worked as the ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, and the High Commissioner to Vanuatu for Australia</p>

<p>Mr Kang's actions drew criticism from environmentalists who expressed concern about the damage he could have caused. </p>

<p>'All Softshell Turtle species in SE Asia are listed as at least vulnerable, while others are endangered,' one person tweeted.</p>

<p>'Consumption is the number 1 threat, and demand is in part due to perception that it is a 'high-status' food, all the more reckless for an Ambassador to promote!'</p>

<p>A wildlife account added: 'Really? Promoting consumption of endangered species and therefore the illegal wildlife trade? Not responsible actions from an Ambassador.'</p>

<p>Mr Kang is an experienced diplomat.</p>

<p>Prior to holding his post with Cambodia, he worked as the ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, and the High Commissioner to Vanuatu for Australia.  </p>
