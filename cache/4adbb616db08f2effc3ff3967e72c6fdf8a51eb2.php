<p>The retired UFC star released a flurry of tweets on Friday night as he tried to explain the reasoning behind his decision to walk away from the sport earlier this summer, and even showed private Instagram messages between him and Dana White. </p>

<p>McGregor was keen to fight on several cards but revealed that he decided to retire - his third in just four years - when the coronavirus pandemic hit after being told he would have to wait until fans could return.</p>

<p>The Irishman then went on to write: 'Anyway all water under the bridge who gives a fook. I’m boxing Manny Pacquiao next in the Middle East.'</p>
