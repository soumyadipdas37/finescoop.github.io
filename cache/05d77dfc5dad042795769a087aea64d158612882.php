<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Memphis Depay is Barcelona's first choice to bolster their attacking options.</p>

<p>As reported by Mundo Deportivo, Depay is an attainable target for Barcelona as he is within their current salary budget.</p>

<p>Depay has also played under Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman for the Dutch national team. </p>

<p>Barcelona have made Memphis Depay their first choice as they look to bolster their attack</p>

<p>Koeman had considered a move for Alexander Isak, but Barcelona deemed the Real Sociedad striker's release clause of €70million (£64million) to be too expensive.</p>

<p>Depay, who could cost £28million, has also been the subject of interest from AC Milan.</p>

<p>Depay played under Ronald Koeman for Holland and could now make the switch to Barcelona</p>

<p>Barcelona considered signing Alexander Isak but were deterred by his £64m release clause</p>

<p>During his time at Lyon Depay has scored 58 goals and provided 43 assists across 142 appearances.</p>

<p>Barcelona are eager to bring in another attacker following the departure of Luis Suarez to Atletico Madrid. </p>

<p>Depay's versatility - he can operate effectively as a striker or on either flank - is hugely appealing to Barcelona. </p>
