<p>'I'm not watching Studio 10 without Joe,' another person commented. 'Joe we need you back on Studio 10 pronto,' another agreed.</p>

<p>'Today's #Studio10 was like trying on a new pair of shoes for the first time. It will take a bit of wearing in before I decide if I like them or not,' one person said.</p>

<p>'That's the end of the show. Doubt it gets renewed next year,' another person wrote.</p>

<p>'I'm not watching without Joe!' Many viewers have criticised the revamped version and want Joe to return to the show alongside Sarah Harris</p>

<p>Studio 10 have also reportedly made the decision to disable comments on the shows Instagram account after viewers criticised the new format.</p>

<p>According to TV Blackbox, hundreds of negative comments have been deleted from the show's Instagram and Facebook pages.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Joe revealed that he had come to the difficult decision to leave Studio 10 last week.</p>

<p>The presenter's position on the morning talk show had been up in the air ever since Channel 10 announced its latest round of redundancies last month.</p>

<p>Addressing the uncertainty surrounding his role, Joe explained that he 'wanted to rip the Band-Aid off and not make it harder than it has to be'.</p>

<p>He began: 'I do have some news. I want to say it here first before you saw it or heard it anywhere else.  </p>

<p>'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought and it's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.</p>

<p>'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role.'</p>

<p>'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of,' he added.</p>

<p>His announcement came after regular Studio 10 panellists Kerri-Anne Kennerley and Natarsha Belling were axed from the network last month due to budget cuts. </p>
