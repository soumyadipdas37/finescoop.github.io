<p>Davina is the 'Director of the New Development Division' at the Oppenheim Group, the real estate firm featured on Selling Sunset</p>

<p>It means that if she really was 30 now she would have been around eight in the university photo and 16 when she obtained her real estate license.</p>

<p>While agents on Selling Sunset are often seen driving high-end cars as they enjoy the high life, Davina was spotted this week in an older Audi A4 as she ran errands in West Hollywood.</p>

<p>In what are believed to be the first candid pictures taken of her, Davina can is seen leaving a home in the Hollywood Hills after apparently going for a swim.</p>

<p>Selling Sunset has been Netflix's first big reality TV hit but recently came under fire after model Chrissy Teigen cast doubts over its stars' real estate careers.</p>

<p>The model tweeted that she looks at a lot of LA real estate and neither her nor her agents had heard of them.</p>

<p>Davina is the 'Director of the New Development Division' at the Oppenheim Group, the real estate firm featured on Selling Sunset.</p>

<p>Currently Mary Fitzgerald, Davina Potratz, Christine Quinn, Amanza Smith, Chrishell Stause, Heather Young, and Maya Vander are all listed on the group's website as realtor associates, despite claims it's all for show</p>

<p>According to the date on the yearbook photos, if she really were 30 now she would have been around eight in the university photo and 16 when she obtained her real estate license</p>

<p>Fans had already raised suspicions over Davina's age after finding out that she first obtained her real estate license in 2006 and now yearbook evidence back up that she is not in her 30s </p>

<p>DailyMail.com spotted her leaving her home in the Hollywood Hills after apparently going for a swim</p>

<p>While agents on Selling Sunset are often seen driving high-end cars as they enjoy the high life, Davina was spotted this week in an old Audi A4 as she ran errands in West Hollywood</p>

<p>Since Selling Sunset's second season, Davina has been seen handling the listing of a $75million mansion in Beverly Hills</p>

<p>The company's website says: 'Throughout her career, Davina has secured property sales in excess of over half a billion dollars and served as an international sales and marketing consultant at several branded and marquee luxury developments.'</p>

<p>Since Selling Sunset's second season, Davina has been seen handling the listing of a $75million mansion in Beverly Hills.</p>

<p>Set on an acre of land, the property features nine bedrooms and 12 bathrooms and is currently owned by real estate developer Adnan Sen.</p>

<p>Despite struggling to find a buyer, Davina recently said: 'It is a great opportunity. It's almost two million dollars in commission.</p>

<p>'So I think anyone who knows all the facts should certainly give it a shot.'</p>

<p>Davina's boss Jason Oppenheim recently fired back at critics of the show, telling Page Six: 'As a licensed agent, Davina had transacted many deals before joining the team in 2018.</p>

<p>This comes as Chrissy Teigen said she has 'never seen' any of the show's stars on on her real estate search, and neither have her agents </p>

<p>The 34-year-old wife of John Legend took to Twitter after her streaming binge to share her thoughts on the show</p>

<p>'Any insinuation that the agents on our show are not experienced, successful, or licensed, evidences a complete disregard for the facts.</p>

<p>'Even a superficial investigation would identify previous team photos, hundreds of millions in transacted sales, and more than 50 years of combined licensed real estate experience from these agents.'</p>

<p>Davina is seen by many fans as Selling Sunset's villain after she had a dramatic season 3 finale bust up with co-star Chrishell Stause.</p>

<p>Former soap actress Chrishell, 39, was just learning about her divorce from This Is Us actor husband Justin Hartley when Davina refused to support her and claimed there were 'two sides to the story'.</p>

<p>Davina later claimed that there was no bad blood between her and Chrishell, saying: 'I want to be neutral and that does not mean that I defend Justin and don't support Chrishell.</p>

<p>'I absolutely support Chrishell and she knows that. I have nothing but compassion and empathy for Chrishell and her situation.'</p>
