<p>Speaking to Dancing on Ice co-hosts Phil and Holly on This Morning, he said: 'I think it's a little bit different than Strictly because that's really defined by the moves that you do. </p>

<p>'Skating is very much the flow and the rhythm of being on the ice. Let's be honest, ice is not that forgiving, and I am 52. I know I look pretty good for it, but that could all change.' </p>

<p>Let's talk: The Australian star spoke to Dancing on Ice co-hosts Phil and Holly on Thursday's edition of This Morning</p>

<p>When Phil joked that Jason would've been "unlikely to smash [his] teeth in" on Strictly like he possibly could on Dancing on Ice, the actor said: 'Thanks for that, Phil. That's a load of encouragement for me.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I've done a little bit of skating in my youth in Australia, surprisingly, in the heat of an Australian summer. I've surfed, I've skied a lot. I guess you bring a little bit of that sort of confidence. </p>

<p>'Doing that in front of five, six, or seven million people is probably a little bit of a difference. To be able to learn a skill and spend some time focused is quite exciting, and I'm looking forward to seeing you guys.'</p>

<p>So far, other stars confirmed for the show include Emmerdale's Joe-Warren Plant, Denise Van Outen and Myleene Klass. </p>

<p>Sweet: Faye, who was previously engaged to Gareth Gates, sweetly gushed that she has loved having her personal trainer boyfriend, Joe Davis (pictured), by her side during training</p>

<p>The Loose Women panellists revealed that Denise, 46, would be appearing on Dancing On Ice on Wednesday's show. </p>

<p>However panellist Linda, 62, sadly pipped her to the post by confirming that she is headed to the ice before the big reveal. </p>

<p>By means of hinting, the Loose Women panel opened an array of envelopes including a picture pf Denise Welch, a transit van, and a breakfast fry up - to mark her time on The Big Breakfast - but Linda accidentally barked: 'Van Outen!'</p>

<p>Despite the gaffe, Denise spoke on the show about her new role and her daughter Betsy, 10, saying: 'I'm really excited. Finally, I get to tell people. I've kept this a secret from most of my friends and family. Betsy doesn't even know....</p>

<p>Yay! The Loose Women panellists revealed that Denise, 46, would be appearing on Dancing On Ice on Wednesday's show</p>

<p>'She's at school, so she's going to find out this afternoon when I pick her up from school.. She will be so excited. She loves the show and we watch it every year...</p>

<p>'Literally, I cannot stand up on ice. Every time I've taken Betsy around on a rink I've been the one on the penguin.' </p>

<p>Last month, it was reported that Denise has signed up to the upcoming series as a contestant in a staggering £40,000 deal. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, Dancing On Ice hosts Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield announced on Tuesday's This Morning that Joe-Warren would be a contestant and teased that they already knew who his partner will be.   </p>

<p>Revealed! Joe Warren-Plant has been confirmed as the second star to sign up to the next series of Dancing On Ice, which will take place in the new year</p>

<p>Denise and Joe-Warren, who has been dating model girlfriend Nicole Hadlow since 2017, joins the previously announced Myleene Klass.</p>

<p>Phillip and Holly will once again return to present the show and the expert panel of Jane Torvill and Christopher Dean, John Barrowman and Ashley Banjo will all resume their roles as judges.</p>
