<p>Who's that girl? Amanda Holden made a casual statement on Wednesday morning as she dressed down for a day of work at Heart Radio</p>

<p>Amanda, who is typically seen in chic dresses at work, was barely-recognisable in the over-sized shirt-jacket with the loose-fitting trousers. </p>

<p>She paired the look with heeled boots and clutched a small handbag for the trip. </p>

<p>In her response to critics after BGT hit screens, Amanda, whose most recent appearance caused 235 viewers to contact the regulator, wrote: 'Mmmm really?! Who has nipples this close to their cleavage?!'  </p>

<p>Sharing the secret behind her bold look, the media personality added: 'FYI. A boned corset dented the girls all night', alongside a series of fried egg emojis.  </p>

<p>Changing looks! The presenter, 49, donned a loose-fitting shacket and baggy trousers in a move that came after she denied suffering a wardrobe malfunction during Saturday's edition of Britain's Got Talent, which was met with over 200 Ofcom complaints</p>

<p>Lashing out: In her response to critics after BGT hit screens, Amanda, whose most recent appearance caused 235 viewers to contact the regulator, wrote: 'Mmmm really?! Who has nipples this close to their cleavage?!'</p>

<p>According to a report from The Mirror on Monday, Ofcom received 277 complaints about the programme, with the majority focusing on the former Wild At Heart actress' ensemble.</p>

<p>Her gown featured a sweetheart neckline and was cinched around her svelte waist, teamed with a pair of sparkling silver barely-there heels.</p>

<p>In a snap shared to Instagram, the blonde showcased her toned pins in the chic outfit, which featured a perilously high thigh slit up the leg of the gown. </p>

<p>What complaints? Amanda, who is typically seen in chic dresses at work, was barely-recognisable in the over-sized shirt-jacket with the loose-fitting trousers</p>

<p>Check me out: The look was worlds away from her usual style as she stepped out </p>

<p>However at the time, some fans claimed Amanda had suffered a nip slip in the look, and they took to Twitter to question if they'd seen more than they'd bargained for during the show.</p>

<p>One wrote on social media: 'Is it me or Amanda's nipples nearly hanging out of her top?', while a second asked, 'Are Amanda's nipples on show?'</p>

<p>Another shared on Twitter, 'Just me, or does Amanda's dress make it look like her nipples are out?', before adding: 'To be clear... I'm not offended just commented on the obvious nipple shadow.'</p>

<p>Chic: She paired the look with heeled boots and clutched a small handbag for the trip</p>

<p>No problems here: She certainly didn't look bothered by the controversy </p>

<p>Clearly shocked, one viewer wrote: 'Is it me or can you see Amanda's nipples?' </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Ofcom, as well as Amanda's representatives and a Britain's Got Talent spokesperson for comment. </p>

<p>This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show.</p>

<p>Amanda made an impression in thigh-skimming gown by Ziad Nakad, showing off a liberal amount of leg thanks to the asymmetric hemline.</p>

<p>Oh dear: This is not the first time Amanda's ensembles have caused a stir, as last year her raunchy ensembles sparked hundreds of complaints from viewers who thought they were too revealing for a family show</p>
