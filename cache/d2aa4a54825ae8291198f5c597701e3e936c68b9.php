<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Insurers have been branded 'shameless' for trying to wriggle out of payments to small businesses battered by coronavirus.</p>

<p>Two High Court judges ruled earlier this month that insurers must pay out under most business interruption policies – types of insurance taken out by firms to protect their income if they are forced to close.</p>

<p>The judgment was heralded as a lifeline for thousands of struggling companies which had to shut their doors during lockdown, after most insurers had refused to pay out, claiming the policies were not designed to cover a nationwide pandemic.</p>

<p>Two High Court judges ruled insurers must pay out under most business interruption policies – types of insurance taken out by firms to protect their income if they are forced to close</p>

<p>But now seven insurance giants, including Hiscox and RSA, have lodged applications to appeal the High Court's decision. </p>

<p>Firms from events companies to restaurants, who were relying on the insurance payout to help them survive the pandemic, fear for their future as they face more delays.</p>

<p>Kim Roe, who runs events business Circa Group based in Tunbridge Wells, holds a business interruption policy with Hiscox.</p>

<p>Despite being told by lawyers that her claim should be covered by the High Court judgment, she is still waiting for a payment. </p>

<p>She said: 'It's clearly a delaying tactic – people like myself are under a lot of pressure, and they're hoping that because of that we'll settle for a lesser amount.</p>

<p>'It is shameless. A lot of people will go to the wall because of this. Insurers are acting like hyenas and waiting for everyone to drop off so they can pick at the bones.'</p>

<p>RSA, which made £492million in profits last year, said it would take an £85million hit if it had to pay out under business interruption policies. </p>

<p>Hiscox, which made £45million of profits in a poor year after a number of catastrophe claims, said the hit would be less than £100million.</p>

<p>The High Court case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority on behalf of businesses affected by the pandemic, in order to decide whether insurers must pay out. </p>

<p>The FCA took eight insurers – Arch, Argenta, Ecclesiastical Insurance, Hiscox, MS Amlin, QBE, Royal &amp; Sun Alliance and Zurich – to court to act as examples. </p>

<p>The judges ruled on September 15 that a majority of the 400,000 firms with business interruption insurance should have a valid claim. </p>

<p>But since then, insurers have been dragging their feet as they remain locked in talks with the FCA over how to pay policyholders.</p>

<p>Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, urged insurers to 'do the right thing by policyholders'.</p>

<p>Hiscox said yesterday that it 'remains committed to an expedited resolution and today's application, pending this hearing, preserves speed of process for all parties should there be an appeal'.</p>

<p>The FCA declined to comment. </p>
