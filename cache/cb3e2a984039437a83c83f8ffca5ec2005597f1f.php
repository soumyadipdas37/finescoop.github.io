<p>Looking ahead: The educational publisher has turned to Andy Bird to guide the company through its move to become a digital-first business</p>

<p>He spent several years as the chairman of Walt Disney International, turning the media giant into a digital-first business – an echo of the ambitions that Pearson has for itself. </p>

<p>The 35-year industry veteran will be appointed once shareholders accept clauses in his pay package, which includes a more than 50 per cent rise in base salary compared to his predecessor John Fallon. </p>

<p>His pay package also includes 16 per cent of his base salary, or £200,000, in cash in lieu of a pension, incentive plans, and money towards a flat in New York 'to be used for business purposes'. </p>

<p>Parts of the plan will need shareholder approval, and Bird's appointment in mid-October will depend on this, a Pearson spokesman said. </p>
