<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A policewoman and a married officer have been sacked over their secret on-duty sex fling - after top brass used GPS to track their squad cars to her home address.</p>

<p>Zoe Phillips, 32, performed oral sex on Andrew Perry, 35, in a force vehicle but they were rumbled by their own police cars.</p>

<p>Mother-of-one PC Phillips also sent him sexy selfies and the two officers met up at her home when they were supposed to be on duty.</p>

<p>The former PCs got together for a string of secret trysts but were snared after an anonymous tip-off to the force.</p>

<p>A misconduct hearing was told an investigation was launched and senior officers tracked the GPS history of officers' squad cars to prove they had been meeting up on duty.</p>

<p>Traffic specialist Perry and schools liaison officer Phillips worked for Gwent Police but resigned when the affair came to light.</p>

<p>Zoe Phillips, 32, pictured, sent Andrew Perry, 35, sexy selfies and the two officers met up at her home when they were supposed to be on duty</p>

<p>Father-of-three Perry, whose wife is still a police officer with the force, confessed to 'heavy petting' between the pair and receiving oral sex.</p>

<p>The hearing was told the pair would separately drive their cars to remote areas so they could meet when they were supposed to be on duty.</p>

<p>The pair have been barred from the force after the panel ruled their actions amounted to gross misconduct.</p>

<p>But the panel said Perry and Phillips - named only as Mr A and Ms B in the hearing - would have been dismissed if they had not quit.</p>

<p>Panel chair, Christopher McKay slammed the pair for their 'deplorable' behaviour and said that their actions had 'undermined public confidence in the police force'.</p>

<p>He added: 'All the contact Mr A had with Ms B was during working hours when he was on duty and this was to the detriment of Gwent Police and the public.</p>

<p>'The fact he was with Ms B in remote locations is likely to have prohibited his ability to respond to calls.</p>

<p>'Ms B sought to minimise her own responsibility for her actions and sought to blame Mr A.</p>

<p>'She was not a victim but a willing participant in what happened between her and Mr A.'</p>

<p>Presenting officer Jonathan Walter had previously told the hearing: 'Anonymous phone calls were made to Gwent Police alleging that Ms B and Mr A were meeting in remote locations whilst on duty and at Ms B's home address for the purpose of a sexual relationship.</p>

<p>'The investigating officer obtained GPS Tetra Mapping data to show the likely whereabouts of Ms B and Mr A in relation to each other whilst they were on duty.'</p>

<p>The hearing was told that the data revealed that the officers were together on a 'large number of occasions when there was no policing reason for doing so'.</p>

<p>In an interview, Phillips admitted that there would be 'kissing and cuddling' when they were both on duty.</p>

<p>Mr Walters said: 'To Mr A's eternal credit he did not flinch from telling the investigating officers exactly what happened.</p>

<p>'This led him to admitting that on one occasion Ms B had performed oral sex on him in a police vehicle when they were both on duty and there had been sexual contact in the form of heavy petting.'</p>

<p>Father-of-three Perry, pictured, whose wife is still a police officer with the force, confessed to 'heavy petting' between the pair and receiving oral sex</p>

<p>The pair also met up at the home of Phillips house for sex while Perry was on duty.</p>

<p>Mr Walters added: 'There is no doubt that Ms B and Mr A were seeing each other during working hours in early 2018 and by no later than March, this had developed into an emotional relationship.</p>

<p>'Ultimately, the relationship between Ms B and Mr A developed into a sexual relationship.'</p>

<p>Perry admitted that two allegations against him amounted to gross misconduct.</p>

<p>Phillips admitted meeting with Perry while he was on duty and to sending a sexualised photograph to him while on duty.</p>

<p>She denied sexual contact with Perry while on duty and argued that her action amount only to misconduct rather than gross misconduct.</p>

<p>However these allegations were found proven by the panel who found it also amounted to gross misconduct.</p>

<p>An allegation that Phillips had taken an x-rated picture while on duty was also found proven but found only to amount to misconduct.</p>
