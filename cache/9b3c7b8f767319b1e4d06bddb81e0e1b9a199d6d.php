<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New data released by Yelp has suggested that a staggering 60 percent of businesses that were forced to shut down temporarily in the coronavirus pandemic have now closed their doors permanently.</p>

<p>As of August 31, 163,735 total U.S. businesses on Yelp had closed since the pandemic began in March, with 97,966 of those going on to shutter permanently, according to a report from the company.</p>

<p>Despite the lifting of the harshest lockdown measures in most areas, the pandemic continues to take a steep economic toll, with capacity limits and lower demand driving many small companies out of business, the data shows.</p>

<p>Restaurants have been among the hardest hit businesses, with 19,590 closing permanently since the pandemic began.</p>

<p>Permanent business closures have risen sharply from July as a percentage of all closures in the pandemic, according to a new report from the directory site Yelp</p>

<p>Restaurants, shopping, beauty and nightlife have been among the hardest hit categories</p>

<p>Faring the worst were restaurants that specialize in dine-in service, such as breakfast and brunch spots, burger joints, dessert places and Mexican restaurants.</p>

<p>On the other hand, restaurants that are well suited to delivery and take-out have fared better, including pizza places, delis, food trucks, bakeries and coffee shops.</p>

<p>Bars and nightlife have also been hard-hit, with permanent closures rising by 10 percent since July.</p>

<p>Retail and shopping have seen a similar rise in permanent closures, with clothing and home decor shuttering at the highest rates.</p>

<p>The beauty industry has seen the sharpest increase in permanent closures since July, rising 43 percent for a total of 7,002 permanent shut-downs.</p>

<p>However, some categories of small businesses have managed to weather the pandemic particularly well, including professional services such as attorneys, architects and accountants.</p>

<p>While professional services such as lawyers and accountants have seen low rates of closures, while burger joints and brunch spots have been among the hardest hit</p>

<p>In those categories, only two to three businesses out of every thousand have been forced to shut down permanently, according to Yelp.</p>

<p>Home and auto services have also survived at a higher rate. Towing companies, plumbers and contractors in particular maintained a low rate of closures, with only six to seven out of every thousand businesses closed.</p>

<p>Geographically, the economic damage has not been spread evenly throughout the country. </p>

<p>Large and densely populated cities and states have seen higher rates of permanent closures, likely due to higher rents and more stringent pandemic regulations on small businesses.</p>

<p>Los Angeles and New York City, the two largest cities in the nation, have seen the highest total number of permanent closures, with more than 7,000 businesses in each city shutting down for good. </p>

<p>Hawaii, California, and Nevada have the highest rate of total closures and permanent closures, while West Virginia and the Dakotas have the lowest closure rates</p>

<p>Hawaii, California, and Nevada have the highest rate of total closures and permanent closures. They’re also the three states with the highest unemployment rates, and among the biggest states for tourism. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, West Virginia and the Dakotas have the lowest closure rates.</p>

<p>Across the country, there are more than 30 million small businesses, which account for roughly half of all private-sector employment. </p>

<p>'Since the first fears of the pandemic emerged in the U.S. in early March, businesses across the nation have endured six months of uncertainty,' Yelp analysts wrote in the report.</p>

<p>'Even in the wake of increased closures we’re seeing businesses effectively transition to new operating models while keeping their employees and consumers safe.'  </p>
