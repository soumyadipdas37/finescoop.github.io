<p>The detached mock-Georgian double-gated property was cordoned off by police today after she was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.</p>

<p>Police were called at around 9.15pm on Tuesday after the unnamed woman was found collapsed in Bexley village, south east London. Pictured, police at the scene today</p>

<p>The death is being treated as suspicious and a man was arrested on suspicion of murder after the grim discovery in the suburb on the London and Kent border.   </p>

<p>He was taken to a south London police station where he remains at this time.</p>

<p>The Met Police say the man and the woman are thought to be known to each other.</p>

<p>Formal identification of the woman has not yet taken place but she was described as 'lovely' by one neighbour who did not want to talk about the tragedy.</p>

<p>Officers were today manning a cordon at the top of Becketts Close, where the horror unfolded.</p>

<p>A police van was parked outside the early-2000s property. The gates were open but a cordon was draped across it.</p>

<p>The garage door was left open with a white Volkswagen parked outside. The house is in a side street cul-de-sac next door to just one other home in a desirable area.</p>

<p>There are also mock Tudor and white rendered mansions with BMWs, Audis and Range Rovers parked in the street.</p>

<p>One local said: 'It's such a quiet area usually - there are a lot of families and it's a good mix of people. There's no troublemakers.</p>

<p>'But last night there were about four police cars with their flashing lights on and an ambulance. That never happens round here.</p>

<p>'I couldn't believe it when I heard someone had been murdered. It's so tragic.'</p>

<p>Another woman said: 'It's such a peaceful neighbourhood and we all look out for each other. It's a tremendous shock to us all.'</p>

<p>One neighbour who lives near the property said: 'We are all totally shocked. We can't believe something like this would happen.</p>

<p>'It's such a nice quiet area. We don't know who the lady is but our thoughts are with her poor family.</p>

<p>'It's a terrible thing to happen.'</p>

<p>A murder investigation has been launched led by Detective Chief Inspector Mick Norman.</p>

<p>He said: 'We are at the very early stages of our investigation, we have arrested a man and our enquiries continue at a pace.</p>

<p>'Our thoughts are with the deceased's family at this sad time. I urge anyone who has information, but has not yet come forward, to get in touch without delay.'</p>
