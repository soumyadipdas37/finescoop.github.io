<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andrea Pirlo appears to already be very comfortable in his new role as Juventus manager, and may even take the surprising decision to rest Cristiano Ronaldo at times this season.</p>

<p>Ronaldo isn't one to sit on the sidelines, but with the star man turning 36 this season, there comes a time where even his legs may need a break.</p>

<p>'When it comes to less important games, we'll try to give him a rest,' Pirlo told Sky Sports Italia. </p>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo may be rested during Juventus' less important fixtures this season</p>

<p>New Juventus boss Andrea Pirlo has said the Portuguese star knows his body's limits</p>

<p>Juventus got their first win of the new Serie A campaign against Sampdoria on Sunday, a routine 3-0 victory in which Ronaldo got on the score sheet. </p>

<p>Pirlo is already putting new tactics into practice, particularly when it came to giving Aaron Ramsey more agency in midfield. </p>

<p>Ronaldo looked just as good as he always has in recent years, but Pirlo knows what it's like to come towards the end of your career, having done so just a few years ago.</p>

<p>'We are thinking about it and talks it over,' he said when asked whether Ronaldo would be part of his squad rotation this year. </p>

<p>Ronaldo got on the score sheet as Juventus thrashed Sampdoria 3-0 in their first game back</p>

<p>The global star is now 35-years-old, so may not be able to play as often as he once did</p>

<p>'He's not tired yet, as we just started, but when we come up to less important games, we'll try to give him a rest.</p>

<p>'He's a very intelligent lad who knows his body very well, so he is aware of when it's time to rest or to step it up.' </p>

<p>With the amount of work Ronaldo puts into his body, it still seems unlikely we'll see him on the bench that often this season. </p>

<p>Pirlo will be in charge as Juventus aim for their 10th Serie A title in a row, and they're off to a good start. Next up they'll play Roma away. </p>
