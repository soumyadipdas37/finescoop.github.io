<p>In a new trailer for Showtime's The Comey Rule released on Thursday, President Trump is painted as a 'mob boss' during the investigation into Russia's interference on the 2016 election</p>

<p>The upcoming miniseries, featuring Jeff Daniels as James Comey, is based on the former FBI director's 32018 memoir, A Higher Loyalty </p>

<p>The new trailer opens with Trump speaking to Comey in the Oval Office as  he threatens to 'go after reporters' spreading 'fake news'.</p>

<p>The series has been promoted as a political drama/thriller however, it appears to have to take a few comedic jabs at the president.</p>

<p>In one scene, Gleeson's character is seen telling one of his aides: 'He's got people thinking I like golden showers!' </p>

<p>The line is reference to the salacious allegations that emerged from an unverified dossier in the Russia investigation in 2016. </p>

<p>In his book, Comey alleged Trump wanted him to investigate the allegation and to prove it was a lie.  </p>

<p>He also claimed the president asked for his 'loyalty' during the investigation - a conversation that is also depicted on screen. </p>

<p>Another scene also references Trump's love for McDonald's, showing an egg McMuffin being delivered to his desk. </p>
