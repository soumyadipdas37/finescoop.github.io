<p>'Some people who are in their 50s are settled down with a partner. I don't live with my partner. I have got more time on my own by being at home. I think I have got a little better as I'm not so co-dependent.</p>

<p>'I used to be not able to do anything on my own and I do like sharing my life with somebody. </p>
