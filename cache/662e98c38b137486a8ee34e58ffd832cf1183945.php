<p>As of Wednesday morning, the Queen is the favourite with odds of just $1.30.</p>

<p>The Bushranger is tipped for second place ($4) and Frillneck is most likely to place third in the competition ($7.50).</p>

<p>Place your bets now! As of Wednesday morning, the Queen is the favourite with odds of just $1.30. Her extremely short odds suggest some degree of insider knowledge that she wins</p>

<p>It's possible an insider leaked the result overnight, causing a surge in bets that resulted in the Queen's odds being slashed significantly.</p>

<p>The majority of viewers are convinced that the Queen is singer Kate Miller-Heidke.</p>

<p>This is because the cryptic clues align with Kate's career and personal life, and The Queen's powerful voice matches that of the classically trained songstress.</p>

<p>Candidate: The majority of viewers are convinced that the Queen is singer Kate Miller-Heidke</p>

<p>Evidence: Tellingly, one particular clue ('I'm 13 times a bridesmaid but never a bride') matches how many times Kate has been nominated for an ARIA award without winning </p>

<p>Makes sense! Another hint about the Queen's desire to 'rule the world' seemingly alludes to her performance at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019</p>

<p>Tellingly, one particular clue ('I'm 13 times a bridesmaid but never a bride') matches how many times Kate has been nominated for an ARIA award without winning.</p>

<p>Another hint about the Queen's desire to 'rule the world' seemingly alludes to her performance at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2019.</p>

<p>The Bushranger is believed to be either Jessica Mauboy or Bonnie Anderson.</p>

<p>Singer and actress Bonnie was briefly 'outed' as the Bushranger on her Wikipedia page last week, but the rogue edit was swiftly deleted.</p>

<p>The Masked Singer's grand finale was filmed under strict lockdown conditions on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Host Osher Günsberg, and judge Jackie 'O' Henderson filmed their segments from a Channel 10 studio in Sydney, while fellow panellists Dave Hughes and Dannii Minogue remained in Melbourne, according to TV Blackbox.</p>

<p>The fourth panellist, Urzila Carlson, is believed to have Zoomed in from New Zealand.</p>

<p>Production at Melbourne's Dockland Studios had been suspended last month after COVID-19 outbreak on set, and the entire cast and crew went into self-isolation.</p>

<p>Channel 10 and Warner Bros. allowed Osher, Jackie and Urzila to return home after two-week quarantine period on compassionate grounds, hence why they filmed their segments remotely.</p>

<p>Jackie revealed on her KIIS FM breakfast show on Wednesday morning that filming had wrapped at about 3am and she hadn't slept.</p>

<p>The finale of The Masked Singer will air Monday, September 14 on Channel 10 </p>
