<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Any suggestions Ole Gunnar Solskjaer had lost his scoring touch were left looking rather foolish as the Manchester United boss showed his strikers how it is done in training. </p>

<p>Filmed by assistant manager Mike Phelan, Solskjaer is seen receiving a ball on his right foot, taking another touch beyond a mannequin marker before striking into the top corner. </p>

<p>'Bang, bang... boom,' comes a voice off camera as the Norwegian expertly picks out the top right corner of the net - and the clip quickly got lots of attention on social media.  </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer showed he has not lost his scoring touch during a training exercise</p>

<p>Shifting the ball onto his right foot after a pass from the left, Solskjaer prepared to shoot</p>

<p>The net had holes in various locations and the aim of the exercise is to fire into the top corner</p>

<p>Solskjaer, who spent 11 years at United as a player, found the top corner finish with aplomb</p>

<p>The 47-year-old United boss is more used to playing his part on the touchline and in the dugout these days but he has not lost his scoring touch. </p>

<p>He formed part of United's attack from 1996 to 2007 and famously scored the winning goal against Bayern Munich to seal the treble in 1999.</p>

<p>Solskjaer will hope his strikers saw the clip of his top-corner finish as the Norwegian ramps up preparations for the new Premier League season.  </p>

<p>Solskjaer is more used to striking on the touchline as manager of Manchester United now</p>

<p>Due to United's run to the Europa League semi-finals last month, their start to the new campaign has been delayed by a further week.  </p>

<p>United start 2020-21 at home against Crystal Palace on September 19 and Solskjaer will look to his strikers to hit the ground running with so much competition for places at the club right now. </p>

<p>Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood combined for 62 goals in all competitions last season.</p>

<p>With Bruno Fernandes preparing for his first full season, Paul Pogba back healthy and £40million arrival Donny van de Beek looking to make a statement in England, Solskjaer will hope he is seeing the ball go into the back of the net on a regular basis as he looks to build on last season's third-placed finish.  </p>

<p>He will hope strikers Anthony Martial (left), Mason Greenwood (middle) and Marcus Rashford (right) prove they are just as clinical as he was in the training drill come the new season</p>
