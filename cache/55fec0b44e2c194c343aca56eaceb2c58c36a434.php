<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former Victorian minister has accused Premier Daniel Andrews of the 'biggest public policy disaster in Australian history' over the handling of his state's coronavirus outbreak in a scathing opinion piece.</p>

<p>Adem Somyurek was sacked as minister for local government and small business by Mr Andrews in June following a 60 Minutes expose on his alleged Labor branch stacking. Mr Somyurek later resigned from the party.</p>

<p>The Turkish-born politician has since launched an attack on the Victorian premier, writing the 'buck stops with him' in an opinion piece published in The Herald Sun.  </p>

<p>Mr Somyurek said he shares responsibility for the deaths of more than 780 Victorians because he was working as a minister when the Victorian government decided to use private security guards in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>Adem Somyurek was sacked in June as the minister for local government and small business, following a 60 Minutes expose on his alleged Labor branch stacking.</p>

<p>'Not because I was part of a collective cabinet decision-making process, but because I failed to insist the premier comply with a proper cabinet process,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Victoria's deadly second wave of coronavirus infections can be traced back to outbreaks at two Melbourne hotels used in the quarantine program. </p>

<p>The embattled program was subject to an inquiry before retired judge Jennifer Coate, who will hand down a report on November 6.</p>

<p>Mr Somyurek claimed the 'decision-making processes of the executive and the potential intermediary role played by their staff' was not in evidence before the inquiry.   </p>

<p>'As the only former minister not constrained by party discipline, it is in the public interest that I attempt to shed light on how we got into such a mess, with so much pain and destruction for so many Victorians,' he wrote.</p>

<p>The former minister claimed Mr Andrews had been 'lucky' until the bungled hotel quarantine program came to light.  </p>

<p>The Turkish-born politician has since launched an attack on the Victorian premier (pictured), writing the 'buck stops with him' in an opinion piece published in The Herald Sun</p>

<p>Mr Somyurek wrote that the premier decreed the use of private security guards for the program, 'without any cabinet decision at all'. </p>

<p>He said quarantine is a federal matter and Mr Andrews did not appear to allocate the portfolio responsibility to another minister, which means 'the ministerial responsibility buck stops with him'. </p>

<p>Mr Somyurek said the premier had been mentored by Legislative Council, Gavin Jennings - who retired from Parliament in mid-March. </p>

<p>Without the 'calming guidance' of Mr Jennings, Mr Somyurek said 'the result is the biggest public policy disaster in Australian history'. </p>

<p>The former minister concluded by writing the premier's government is 'centralised and micromanaged', adding that 'talented ministers lack autonomy'. </p>

<p>Mr Somyurek previously wrote another opinion piece for The Australian, where he slammed Melbourne's lockdown curfew. </p>

<p>Mr Somyurek said Mr Andrews, who hails from Labor's Socialist Left faction, had little regard for the economic cost of his Stage Four lockdowns.</p>

<p>'The loss of civil rights and economic damage are just collateral damage,' he said.</p>

<p>'The government has encroached on our lives in ways unimaginable only a few months ago.'</p>

<p>On Thursday, Victoria recorded 15 new cases of coronavirus and two more fatalities, bringing the state's death toll to 800 and the national figure to 888. </p>
