<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Value-losing vehicles: We reveal the 10 70-plate cars in showrooms this September that will lose around three quarters of their list price after three years of ownership, starting with the Vauxhall Astra (pictured)</p>

<p>September is a bumper month for car sales due to the increased demand for a new number plate arrival, which bring with it a raft of discounts on 70-plate models. </p>

<p>But there are some 70-plate models this month that you might want to avoid - even if they are massively discounted.</p>

<p>That's not because they're particularly unreliable or bad to drive, but they depreciate quicker than any other model.</p>

<p>We've listed the 10 cars to steer clear of if you don't want to see the value of a vehicle plummet as soon as you drive it off a dealer's forecourt.</p>

<p>Price, running costs, the type of car a buyer wants, reliability, the looks, what technology it has and its badge appeal are all factors customers consider when stepping foot into a showroom to purchase a new motor.</p>

<p>However, one aspect of ownership that is commonly overlooked is depreciation - which should really be one of the first thing a new car buyer considers when stepping foot into a showroom.</p>

<p>That's because the slower a car loses value the more you will get when it comes time to sell.</p>

<p>And even if you think you're avoiding this issue by getting a new car on finance, rapid depreciation will also sting you when you're spreading out the cost of a zero-mile motor.</p>

<p>That's because the most commonly used form of car finance - Personal Contract Purchase, or PCP - calculates the monthly payments by how much the model depreciates.</p>

<p>Fortunately, for those motorists intending to buy a new car this month, we can tell you which motors you might want to side step.</p>

<p>What Car? has named 10 models that lose the highest percentage of their original price - as well as the cars that hold their value best. </p>

<p>All figures are based on the trade-in value for an example that's just turned three years old and has covered an average of 36,000 miles...</p>

<p>Model:  1.5 Turbo D Ultimate Nav</p>

<p>The Astra is a very competent family hatchback, but buyers are starting to look elsewhere and resale values have taken a battering as a result</p>

<p>List price new: £27,855</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £7,400 </p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 73.4%</p>

<p>Vauxhall dealers are likely to offer huge discounts on the Astra right now. That's because its family hatchback is losing pace with rivals like the VW Golf and Ford Focus, which are both better to drive.</p>

<p>That said, the Astra is spacious, well equipped and offers good value for money when you can haggle a big discount. But you'll need to strike a decent deal to avoid the sizable depreciation of 73.4 per cent in three years.</p>

<p>Model: 1.0 Mild Hybrid Launch Edition</p>

<p>The Fiat 500 is a hugely popular model in the UK, but the convertible version isn't in the same level of demand as the hatchback</p>

<p>List price new: £19,800</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £5225</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 73.6%</p>

<p>The Fiat 500 is a very popular city car, thanks to its dinky dimensions, cute looks and all-round retro styling. But while the hatchback is in big demand and holds its value well on the second-hand market, the convertible - or 'C' - isn't really cut for motoring in Britain and suffers as a result.</p>

<p>Throw into the mix that a new 500C is now launched with an electric powertrain only and you might begin to understand why depreciation is pretty catastrophic for this car right now.</p>

<p>Model: 3.0d V6 Portfolio</p>

<p>The Jaguar XF is arguably the best executive saloon to drive, but lacks the suave interior and refinement buyers want in this category</p>

<p>List price new: £50,550</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £12,950</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 74.4%</p>

<p>The more expensive a new car is to buy, the bigger impact depreciation has. And in the case of the Jaguar XF, a rapid loss of value means the family saloon with a 3.0-litre V6 engine hemorrhages a massive £32,500 of its £50,500 list price after 36 months of ownership.</p>

<p>It's a bitter blow for the executive cat, which is arguably the best to drive in its class, but does lack a flashy interior and hushed refinement.</p>

<p>Model: 1.0 VTi 72 Feel 3dr </p>

<p>The Citroen C1 is proof that badge power does exist. It's mechanically the same as the Toyota Aygo but depreciated much faster due to the negative reliability connotations of French cars</p>

<p>List price new: £12,795</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £3,275</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 74.4%</p>

<p>The C1 ticks every box you want if you're buying a city car. It's ultra compact, nimble, roomy enough for four and extremely economical as well as cheap to tax and insure.</p>

<p>However, it has fallen foul of other rivals entering the smallest of car segments, especially the emergence of the VW Up!, Seat Mii and Skoda Citigo triumvirate. The Citroën badge also doesn't help the C1, as buyers are more likely to choose the mechanically-identical Toyota Aygo due to the Japanese brand's strong reliability track record. The result is pretty catastrophic depreciation.</p>

<p>Model: 1.0 72 Allure 3dr </p>

<p>The Peugeot 108 and Citroen C1 and sister cars. Both have become less desirable on the used market with the emergence of rivals, such as the VW Up! city car</p>

<p>List price new: £14,140</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £3,475</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 75.4%</p>

<p>No, you're not having a case of déjà vu. The Peugeot 108 and Citroën C1 are sister cars, along with the Aygo. But while the Toyota avoids the huge levels of depreciation that would land it in a list like this, the French twins are not in big demand on the used market.</p>

<p>Aside from a number of minor visual differences, the 108 is essentially the same the Citroën C1 and therefore shares all the same city-car traits.</p>

<p>Model: S560 Grand Edition</p>

<p>The S-Class Cabrio is a fine way to spend a summer frolic through the country lanes. But values of expensive convertibles don't perform well in the UK</p>

<p>List price new: £125,010</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £30,300</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 75.8%</p>

<p>This one is going to hurt. As previously mentioned with the Fiat 500C, convertibles aren't big business in the UK due to our less than ideal climates. But if you do want to feel the sun on your shoulders and the wind through your hair, the Mercedes S-Class Cabriolet is not a bad way to go.</p>

<p>However, crippling depreciation strips owners of almost £95,000 of the £125,000 they would have paid up front. You'll be losing pounds as quickly as your hair follicles driving at 100mph with the top down.</p>

<p>Model: L 55 TFSI quattro Vorsprung </p>

<p>The Audi A8 is a quality limo. It has a beautiful ride, is hushed on the move and is packed with technology. But buyers of expensive cars like this aren't necessarily looking on the second-hand market</p>

<p>List price new: £107,535</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £24,925</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 76.8%</p>

<p>The A8 is like the Harry Houdini of the Audi range - but instead of making an elephant disappear it will see your bank balance vanish before your eyes.</p>

<p>This one is a little harder to explain, given how good the long-wheelbase limo is. It rides beautifully, is incredibly refined and built to an exceptionally high standard. The downfall is likely thirsty engines - especially the 3.0-litre V6 petrol in this one - and the limited demand for second-hand luxury executive cars.</p>

<p>Model: 1.5 Blue HDi 100 Active </p>

<p>The 308 is Peugeot's answer to a Ford Focus or VW Golf. Buyers tend to prefer the latter two models, which is hitting the resale values of other cars in the sector, including this one</p>

<p>List price new: £22,740</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £4,875</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 78.6%</p>

<p>While most buyers in the medium-size family hatchback market will opt for the badge kudos of the VW Golf of all-round appeal of the Ford Focus, the French brands also throw their weight into the class, including Peugeot and its 308.</p>

<p>If running costs are a big issue then you'll be taken with its range of frugal engines. It also has a neat interior. But poor driving dynamics, cramped rear seats and little demand for them on the used market means depreciation is a whopper for the 308.</p>

<p>Model: 1.6 Multijet Lounge</p>

<p>Fiat has failed to break into the family hatchback market with the Tipo. Sales are very limited, and demand for them on the used market is low</p>

<p>List price new: £21,815</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £4,600</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 78.9%</p>

<p>If you thought the Peugeot 308's value dropped like a stone, check out the family hatchback rival from neighbouring Italy.</p>

<p>While Fiat is better known for its compact models like the Panda and 500, it has recently attempted to crack the medium-size hatchback sector with the Tipo. And failed. Prices are cheap in comparison to rivals, discounts are usually hefty and equipment levels generous. But very few people want them, hence the near 79 per cent loss of value in three years.</p>

<p>Model: V6d </p>

<p>Expensive to buy and run, diesel powered, not likely to be reliable and expensive to repair - it's easy to see why the Maserati Quattroporte tops this list</p>

<p>List price new: £75,735</p>

<p>Value after 3 yrs/36k miles: £15,775</p>

<p>Percentage of value lost: 79.2%</p>

<p>This Maserati ticks all the boxes for a car that's likely to depreciate quickly.</p>

<p>It's built by a brand with a sloppy recent track record for reliability, it has a big and powerful diesel engine and is a car class that's widely avoided on the second-hand market due to fears that repairs will be astronomically expensive. Add to that the fact the Quattroporte is extremely dated by today's standards, is bland to drive, has a rattly ride and lackluster infotainment system. No wonder it sheds so much value so rapidly. </p>

<p>Model: 2.9 V6 4 PDK</p>

<p>List price new: £74,795</p>

<p>Value after 3yrs/36k miles: £40,325</p>
