<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the shocking moment a member of the public is karate-kicked in the face by a suspected fly-tipper he was filming.</p>

<p>The victim, a wildlife enthusiast who does not wish to be identified, was out looking for a peregrine falcon to photograph when he saw two men driving a white van down a remote country lane in Dorset.</p>

<p>He followed them on foot and when he caught up with the pair he found them apparently dumping rubbish inside a burnt-out vehicle already left there.</p>

<p>The incident happened on Watery Lane on the outskirts of Burton, near Christchurch, Dorset, on Tuesday. </p>

<p>A member of the public caught two men 'fly-tipping' down a country lane on the outskirts of Burton, near Christchurch, Dorset. He blocked their escape and forced them to retrieve rubbish dumped in a burned out car</p>

<p>The public-spirited man started videoing the two men for evidence.</p>

<p>In the footage, he can be heard shouting: 'Pick that up! Pick up the stuff you've left stuff there. Pick it up! Go back!'</p>

<p>He then blocks their escape by standing in front of the Peugeot van.</p>

<p>The driver has no choice but to reverse towards the dumped rubbish.</p>

<p>As one of the men gets out and starts retrieving the waste, the filmer continues says: 'Well done,' before the man aims a flying kick at the 51-year-old victim.</p>

<p>The force of the blow knocked the camera out of his hands and sent it flying to the ground.</p>

<p>The incident happened in a notorious fly tipping spot on the outskirts of Burton on Tuesday and was caught on camera</p>

<p>Suddenly the man turns aggressive and karate-kicks the person filming him in the face, bruising his fingers and knocking the camera out of his hand</p>

<p>The man also suffered bruising to his fingers in the assault and had to go to hospital.</p>

<p>He reported the incident to the police and sent them the footage - which clearly shows the number plate of the van in question.</p>

<p>But he received a reply to say that a police officer would contact him on October 3 and they only after that will they speak to the suspects. </p>

<p>The man said: 'I was filming wildlife up the lane and saw this white van go down a restricted road where a burned out car is still waiting to be taken away by the council from several weeks ago.</p>

<p>'The area has been notorious for fly tipping over the years.</p>

<p>'I followed the van because I suspected they were fly-tippers.</p>

<p>'I started filming them as they began unloading the van.</p>

<p>'I was shaking through nerves but was quite pleased when they started putting the stuff back into their van.</p>

<p>'I was going to let them off and not do anything with the footage but then I was attacked.</p>

<p>A second man waits in the white Peugeot van as the other retrieves the waste. The incident was reported to the Dorset Police and they are making enquiries </p>

<p>'The guy had so much stuff in his arms that I was really shocked when he kicked at me.</p>

<p>'I didn't feel any pain but then I looked at my fingers and they were bruised.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for Dorset Police conformed they had received a report of assault and criminal damage in relation to the incident.</p>

<p>He said: 'It was reported that a small white van drove down a restricted footpath and the occupants were seen to unload bags in the area.</p>

<p>'A member of the public asked them to put their stuff back, but was then reportedly assaulted and damage was caused to a camera he was holding.</p>

<p>'Enquiries are ongoing into the incident. No arrests have been made.' </p>
