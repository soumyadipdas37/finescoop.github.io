<p>An ice addict father who repeatedly raped a five-year-old girl and made a sick collection of photographs of his abuse has been jailed for nine years (file picture)</p>

<p>Flenady, who the court heard has 'many children' of his own, pleaded guilty to a raft of child sex offences.</p>

<p>Judge Paul Smith said Flenady's sexual abuse was 'brazen' and that he used 'violence to discipline her, which explains her silence'.</p>

<p>'This was a vulnerable child who had not yet reached her sixth birthday when the offending began,' the judge added.</p>

<p>The child rapist's defence lawyer Colin Reid said his client was addicted to meth at the time of the rapes, was sorry and was studying the Bible in prison.</p>

<p>Flenady was jailed for nine years and will not be eligible until he has served half of his sentence. </p>
