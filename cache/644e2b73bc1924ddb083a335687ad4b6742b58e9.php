<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho would've liked to say a few more things in his interview following Tottenham Hotspur's draw with Newcastle United on Sunday, but avoided a fine by keeping quiet. </p>

<p>Newcastle were given a last minute penalty in yet another handball controversy, and Callum Wilson made it 1-1 at the death with their only shot on target in the whole game.  </p>

<p>'If I want to give some money away I'll give it to charity, not to the FA,' Mourinho told Sky Sports. 'So, I prefer not to comment.'</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho would not comment on a late controversial penalty given to Newcastle United</p>

<p>Andy Carroll latched onto a header from a late free-kick, and the ball came off Eric Dier's arm. </p>

<p>The Tottenham man was just inches away, and was facing in the other direction, however since his arm was in an 'unnatural position,' the spot kick was given after a VAR check.  </p>

<p>More to follow. </p>
