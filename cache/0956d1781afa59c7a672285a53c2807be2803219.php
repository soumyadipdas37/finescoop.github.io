<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelorette, starring sisters Elly and Becky Miles, is set to premiere on Wednesday, October 7.</p>

<p>And on Thursday, Channel 10 released an extended trailer for the brand new series - and it looks like it's going to be one of the wildest seasons to date.</p>

<p>The new promo teases a cringeworthy strip show courtesy of one of the contestants, at least fifteen steamy kisses, and a particularly savage break-up.</p>

<p>Wild! An extended trailer for The Bachelorette shows Becky Miles (centre) getting a lap dance from a potential suitor, while her sister Elly Miles (right) watches on in disbelief</p>

<p>'Can't wait to see these guys with their shirts off!' Elly, 25, says within the first 20 seconds of the trailer, as it's revealed the sisters are about to watch a strip tease in order to get closer to the lads.</p>

<p>The promo then cuts to a suitor gyrating on Becky, 30, completely shirtless, as the flustered blonde tells the camera: 'Shannon could do that anytime!'</p>

<p>The teaser also reveals some of the high-octane single dates, including skydiving, sailing on a private yacht, and walking across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.</p>

<p>But despite these high points, host Osher Günsberg makes the sinister promise that it won't be an easy ride for the siblings.</p>

<p>Thrills! The promo also reveals some of the high-octane single dates, including skydiving, sailing on a private yacht, and walking across the Sydney Harbour Bridge (pictured)</p>

<p>'I think it's time for you to leave': Becky (right) is also seen furiously telling a mystery man to get out of the mansion before a rose ceremony</p>

<p>Devastated: Elly is shown storming out of the mansion in tears during the two-minute clip </p>

<p>'If I've got to push people out the way to get what I want, sorry, but I'm going to do that,' one suitor says, before another warns Becky of the 'shallow and disrespectful' comments one of his rivals is making about her behind her back.</p>

<p>'I think it's time for you to leave,' Becky then furiously tells a mystery man, before the camera cuts to Elly in tears in the mansion's garden.</p>

<p>However, in true Bachelorette style, there's an abundance of passion to be had - and the women are seen sharing raunchy kisses with a range of suitors.</p>

<p>'I'm falling in love with you,' one of the men is heard saying, as the jaw-dropping trailer comes to an end. </p>

<p>Emotional moment: Elly bursts into tears multiple times during the trailer, as she finds it hard to ascertain who is genuine and who is just looking for fame</p>

<p>Steamy! In true Bachelor style, there's an abundance of passion to be had - and the sisters are seen sharing steamy kisses with a range of suitors</p>

<p>Saucy! Elly is even shown hooking up with a suitor in a hot tub</p>

<p>It appears the show has been a positive experience for the sisters.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Elly told Who magazine they had both found and were still with their respective winners.</p>

<p>'Yes we have [both found love]. I'm so happy right now for myself and for Bec. Her guy is the best, I love him - for her,' she said.</p>

<p>Elly added that she'd hoped her sister would find someone on the show after going though 'a lot of hardship' in past relationships.</p>

<p>Hot and heavy! The trailer features at least 15 kisses, as it's clear the sisters didn't hesitate to try the merchandise before making their decisions</p>

<p>Becky also told the publication that Elly had allowed herself to be more vulnerable this season, and was glad it had paid off for her.</p>

<p>When asked if they'd ever fought over the same guy in the mansion, Elly gave one major reason why that was never going to be on the cards.</p>

<p>'There was no chance we'd fall for the same guy, because we both have very different taste when it comes to men,' she said.</p>

<p>'Anyone Becky is interested in, I automatically put them in the brother basket.'</p>

<p>The Bachelorette premieres Wednesday, October 7, at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>It worked! It appears the show has been a positive experience for the sisters. On Thursday, the pair told Who magazine they'd both found and were still with their respective winners</p>
