<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Matthew Koma is one committed husband and father.</p>

<p>The musician, 33, is the beloved spouse to one Hilary Duff, and on Monday he revealed the latest way he's demonstrating his undying love for his dear wife.  </p>

<p>In a very cheeky Instagram post, the Winnetka Bowling League frontman showed off a brand new tattoo of Duff's first name – scrawled onto his left buttock.</p>

<p>Commitment: Matthew Koma, beloved spouse of Hilary Duff, on Monday revealed a brand new tattoo of Duff's first name – scrawled onto his left buttock</p>

<p>The ink displays Hilary's name – one 'L', not two – scrawled in a cursive that some users commented was actually her signature.</p>

<p>'Good luck winning a fight with your wife when her name's tattooed on your butt cheek,' Matthew captioned the literally cheeky snap. </p>

<p>He added the hashtags #squats #gainz and #laseraway, the first two referring to his efforts at toning that particular part of his body with exercise. </p>

<p>Clearly in love: It was the latest way Matthew demonstrated his undying love for his dear wife of nearly one year; seen on Instagram </p>

<p>Hilary, for her part, vociferously approved of the body decoration, writing in the comments, 'Finest tiniest booty around'. </p>

<p>She also added a hashtag of her own: #YouStuckNowBoy.  </p>

<p>Other famous followers chimed in as well, with Mandy Moore simply commenting, 'Dying' and comedienne Whitney Cummings joking, 'Wait I just got this too'. </p>

<p>Hilary, for her part, vociferously approved of the body decoration, writing in the comments: 'Finest tiniest booty around'</p>

<p>And Hilary's moniker isn't the only tatt Koma has recently added onto his person.</p>

<p>Just last week, he displayed another image on Instagram, this time showing what appeared to be a tattoo on the back of his thigh in honor of his daughter with Duff, Banks. </p>

<p>The illustration shows a crowned troll, with a toothy grin, wearing a fur cape of sorts. </p>

<p>For daughter Banks: And Hilary's moniker isn't the only tattoo that Koma has recently added onto his person</p>

<p>In the caption, Koma explained the reasoning for the adornment.</p>

<p>'When your daughter’s favorite movie is Trolls and your best friend is the voice of Gristle, you have <?php echo e('@'); ?>jaynawon tattoo this on you. Thanks for the Bergen ❤️'</p>

<p>The ink is clearly an ode to the 2016 animated film adored by Banks, almost two, as well as Matthew's good friend, Superbad star Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who voiced King Gristle in the film as well as this year's Trolls World Tour sequel. </p>

<p>Duff and Koma have been in a relationship since January 2017, which eventually led to them getting married in December 2019.</p>

<p>The Younger actress had previously been married to NHL athlete Mike Comrie for nearly five years when she filed for divorce in February 2015.</p>

<p>The pair share son Luca Cruz, eight. </p>
