<p>She told New! Magazine: 'I've had a lot of abuse from people in wheelchairs because I said I felt like Carl wouldn't fancy me in a wheelchair. </p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'Katie was horrified when she was called about the fire - apparently the caretaker built a huge fire right next to the house, and when it went up the side of the house was covered in flames.</p>

<p>'It was a huge fire - a neighbour called the fire brigade thinking the house was burning down. It was put out in the end but you could see the smoke billowing across the road. She says the house is cursed.'</p>
