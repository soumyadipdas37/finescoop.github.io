<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona 'are primed to make one final effort to sign Lautaro Martinez from Inter Milan' after player sales freed up funds.</p>

<p>Inter have not budged from their £90million valuation of the 23-year-old Argentine forward all summer.</p>

<p>That has proved prohibitive for Barcelona, whose finances have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Barcelona 'will make one final attempt' to sign Argentine striker Lautaro Martinez from Inter</p>

<p>Martinez, pictured after Inter's Europa League final loss, is valued by the Italian club at £90m</p>

<p>But, according to Spanish newspaper Marca, the departures of Arturo Vidal, Nelson Semedo and Luis Suarez in recent days has allowed one last push.</p>

<p>The money raised from selling these three players, plus Arthur Melo and Ivan Rakitic, has enabled them to make a final offer for Martinez.</p>

<p>Marca say that around £64m has been cut from Barcelona's wage bill to accommodate Martinez's salary.</p>

<p>However, Barcelona know that if they meet Inter's asking price, they won't be able to strengthen in other areas prior to the deadline of October 5.</p>

<p>Ideally, Ronald Koeman would like to add depth at centre-back and right-back before the summer window closes.</p>

<p>New Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has overseen a revamp of the Barcelona squad</p>

<p>Dutch forward Memphis Depay, of Lyon, is Koeman's preferred attacking option</p>

<p>Luis Suarez became the latest player to depart Barcelona after he joined Atletico Madrid </p>

<p>Koeman would prefer Memphis Depay to Martinez, while Girona striker Cristhian Stuani has emerged as another option in attack.</p>

<p>Barcelona will kick-off their LaLiga season at home to Villarreal this Sunday evening following a summer of upheaval.</p>

<p>Not only has Koeman replaced Quique Setien as manager in the wake of their humiliating 8-2 Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich, but the squad has been revamped.</p>

<p>Several players have departed, including Arthur, who signed for Juventus in a swap deal with Miralem Pjanic, and Suarez, who joined Atletico Madrid for £5.5m this week.</p>
