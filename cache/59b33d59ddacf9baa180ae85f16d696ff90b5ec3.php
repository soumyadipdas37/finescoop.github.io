<p>The former footballer, 40, was said to be gearing up to don his skates in January but Frankie, 31, told MailOnline the show is a big time commitment he can't do right now.</p>

<p>Speaking as part of her ambassador role with Atopia's Month of Moderation, Frankie said: 'No, I don't think [he'll be doing it]. He’s actually really good at ice-skating. Annoyingly, he’s good at everything.'</p>

<p>Not happening: Frankie Bridge has revealed her husband Wayne, 40, will not be appearing on this year's series of Dancing On Ice, despite recent reports saying he had joined the show</p>

<p>While Frankie has a background in dance from her years as a member of The Saturdays and as a contestant on Strictly Come Dancing, she doesn't think she'd be any good on the ITV series.  </p>

<p>She said: 'I have the fear! Wayne does not have the fear. We’ve been ice skating with the kids sometimes and I just found it so difficult. He came to the ice rink with me a couple of times and was skating backwards and doing all this stuff.</p>

<p>'I don’t know, it’s a big time commitment and I think the difference between Dancing On Ice and Strictly is that I love Strictly and I had always wanted to do it. </p>

<p>'It’s nerve wracking and you get to learn something new but with Dancing On Ice, it's a little underplayed because you have to learn to dance and skate and you have to be so brave, there’s so many injuries. I don’t think I could do it.'</p>

<p>Stars who have signed on to compete on next year's series include Myleene Klass, Denise Van Outen and Jason Donovan.  </p>

<p>Wayne, who made 36 appearances for the England national team between 2002 and 2009, retired from football in 2014.</p>

<p>Asked if he misses the game, Frankie said: 'I think he probably does miss it. He played for so long and for such a long age, he really enjoys being at home with the kids and having more family time. </p>

<p>'I think he mainly misses the banter and hanging out with the other guys, he misses that side of it more.'</p>

<p>The couple, who are parents to Parker, six, and Carter, five, became viral sensations during lockdown as they entertained their social media fans with their humorous TikTok dance videos.  </p>

<p>Frankie added: 'It’s a big time commitment and I think the difference between Dancing On Ice and Strictly is that I love Strictly and I had always wanted to do it' (pictured in 2014)</p>

<p>Frankie told how the couple are both dedicated to fitness but they still let themselves cut loose every now and then. </p>

<p>She said: 'We generally don’t work out together because normally one of us has the kids and we have quite different ideas about what a workout is. Wayne likes to punish himself whereas I quite like to enjoy myself and do what needs to be done. </p>

<p>'We do try to be as healthy as possible but we still go out for dinners and have a drink and we have chicken burgers and we’re not strict.'</p>

<p>Asked if her children are aware she was in a famous girlband or that their father is a former footballer, Frankie said: 'They have no idea. They know we’re on the telly sometimes but I think they think everyone’s parents are on the telly sometimes.'</p>

<p>Frankie added whether either of her children will take after her in musical ability remains to be seen, saying: 'They can both find a beat and they’ve both got rhythm. My oldest has just started playing the drums, but who knows if he’ll keep that up.'</p>

<p>Speaking about cutting down on alcohol for Atopia's Month of Moderation, Frankie said: 'It’s about being a bit more mindful, not saying you can’t ever drink again, but think about it, and you’ll feel fresher the next day. It’s about finding the balance and what works with you.'</p>

<p>Atopia is hosting a Month of Moderation throughout October to show how to moderate alcohol for a more mindful way of living. </p>
