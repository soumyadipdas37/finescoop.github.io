<p>Having long been dubbed the brightest future star in world tennis, Tomic's career is almost at a point of no return.</p>

<p>The argument led to Ms Hoppe (pictured) leaving the club, while Tomic - a regular patron - was allowed to stay. Daily Mail Australia understands the pair have been involved in an on-and-off relationship for a number of years, including following Ms Hoppe's season of The Bachelor</p>

<p>Ms Hoppe refused to comment on the altercation when contacted by Daily Mail Australia</p>

<p>The world number 209 has not won a Grand Slam singles match since mid-2018.</p>

<p>The former Wimbledon quarter finalist was such a prodigious young talent that at 12 he was signed by management giant IMG.</p>

<p>But after reaching a highest ranking of 17 in 2016, Tomic's career has been downhill ever since and marred by a number of incidents both off and on the court.</p>

<p>His altercation with Ms Hoppe came just a day after two AFL players were kicked out of the league's COVID-19 hub for a brawl outside the same strip club.</p>

<p>Bookmakers currently list Kaitlyn as a $15 chance to win the heart of The Bachelor, Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>CCTV showed the man being knocked to the ground in the push and shove.</p>

<p>Stack, 20, and Coleman-Jones, 21, were both suspended for the remainder of 2020.</p>
