<p>Couple: Last week, on the Tamron Hall Show, Banks denied she and Bélanger-Martin were engaged after she was snapped with a ring on her left hand ring finger </p>

<p>Banks, meanwhile, is finding her footing as the new host of Dancing With The Stars, replacing both Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews for season 29 which premiered earlier this month.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it hasn't been smooth sailing for the star and fans of the long-running celebrity competition series have been vicious about her performance on social media. </p>

<p>After the season premiere, a majority of the tweets desperately begged for the return of veteran hosts Bergeron and Andrews who were shockingly canned in July.</p>

<p>And following last week's episode, Banks shared a video on TikTok in which she acknowledged she had made some mistakes on the show but had pushed through them.</p>

<p>'Tonight I hosted the second episode of Dancing with the Stars... and, it wasn't perfect,' the TV host said in the video. 'Yeah, I had a lot of fun but I messed up, I said the wrong words, but the thing is I kept going.' </p>

<p>Speaking up: Also last week, Banks defended herself as the new host of Dancing With The Stars after facing criticism on Tuesday night's episode and the show's season 29 premiere </p>

<p>New gig: The former Victoria's Secret Angel and daytime chat show host replaced longtime DWTS hosts  Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews for season 29 which premiered earlier this month</p>
