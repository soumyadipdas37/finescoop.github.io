<p>For the only signal a man needs to tell if a woman is in the mood for a passionate encounter is to pay attention to their natural smells, a study shows. </p>

<p>Scientists found males are able to detect subtle changes in the armpit aroma of females who are aroused. </p>

<p>And far from being a turn-off, it gets chaps in the mood too. It is believed to be the first study to confirm men can detect pheromones in sweat when women are sexually excited. </p>

<p>In the first test, the women read an article about knitting and watched a short film about bridge-building. </p>

<p>The men, who had no idea what the other group had been doing, were asked to rate whether they found the scent stimulating or not afterwards. </p>

<p>A week later, the experiment was repeated but the women read erotic passages from 50 Shades Of Grey and watched sex scenes from a film. </p>

<p>The results showed men found the odours much more intense and sexually arousing in those that had been reading or viewing erotic material. </p>

<p>The study was published in the Archives of Sexual Behaviour.</p>

<p> Previous studies have suggested women give off a certain aroma at their most fertile time of the month. </p>

<p>Others suggest humans can smell chemicals in those gripped by fear. </p>
