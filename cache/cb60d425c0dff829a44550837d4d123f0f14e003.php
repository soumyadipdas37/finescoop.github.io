<p>Bruno Fernandes' last-gasp penalty gave Manchester United a 3-2 away at Brighton</p>

<p>Here are the post-match player ratings from the match at the Amex... </p>

<p>Brighton (3-4-3):</p>

<p>Mat Ryan - 6</p>

<p>Powerless to prevent any of United's goals, distributed well throughout.</p>

<p>Ben White - 6</p>

<p>Faded in second half after a promising opening. Left for dead by Rashford’s brilliance in build up to United’s second.</p>

<p>Ben White (right) was left for dead as Marcus Rashford (left) put United 2-1 in front</p>

<p>Commanding display, slightly hesitant on United’s equaliser which allowed Maguire to nip in.</p>

<p>Aaron Webster - 6</p>

<p>Looping header hit the crossbar in first half. Solid if slightly hesitant when bringing the ball out from the back.</p>

<p>Tariq Lamptey - 7</p>

<p>Won the first-half penalty, a real threat down the right-hand side. Faded slightly in second half but another strong performance from the teenager.</p>

<p>It was another bright showing from Tariq Lamptey (left) who won another first-half penalty</p>

<p>Adam Lallana - 7</p>

<p>Marshalled Pogba well, provided great energy. Replaced on 74 minutes as Brighton went in search of equaliser.</p>

<p>Steven Alzate - 8</p>

<p>Excellent on the ball, kept Brighton ticking in midfield. Unfortunate to be on the losing side.</p>

<p>Solly March - 7</p>

<p>Grabbed equaliser in stoppage time and will rightly feel aggrieved to be on losing side after promising display.</p>

<p>Leandro Trossard (right) hit the woodwork three times at the Amex Stadium against United</p>

<p>Leandro Trossard - 6</p>

<p>Hit the woodwork on three separate occasions, worked hard throughout. Will be cursing his luck in front of goal.</p>

<p>Busy and ran the channels well, never let United’s defenders settle. Replaced on 74 minutes.</p>

<p>Neal Maupay - 7</p>

<p>From hero to villian after cheeky panenka left De Gea red-faced, adjudged to have handled the ball which led to United's penalty at the death.</p>

<p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka - 6</p>

<p>Struggled at time defensively and sloppy in possession. Strong in the tackle though and looked threatening going forward.</p>

<p>Victor Lindelof - 6</p>

<p>Kept busy by Brighton’s industrious front three. Dealt with any aerial danger commandingly. Still questions marks over his abilities in 1v1 situations.</p>

<p>Harry Maguire - 6</p>

<p>Forced the equaliser at a time when United badly needed it. Better in possession than in recent weeks, still hesitant at times in defensive situations.</p>

<p>United captain Harry Maguire (right) played a big role in the equaliser then won a late penalty</p>

<p>Luke Shaw - 6</p>

<p>Tough time dealing with the lively Lamptey to begin with but better going forward and won the free kick which led to United’s equaliser.</p>

<p>Paul Pogba - 5</p>

<p>Too casual in possession at times, struggled to have any real impact on the game. Survived VAR penalty check early in second half. Replaced on 64 minutes.</p>

<p>Nemanja Matic - 6</p>

<p>Worked hard and provided Maguire with the equaliser. Too slow to release the ball at times.</p>

<p>One of his quieter days in front of goal, looked a threat on the counter. Replaced on 82 minutes.</p>
