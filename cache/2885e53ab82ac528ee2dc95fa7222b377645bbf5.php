<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of London's oldest parks is today welcoming a herd of rare cows which haven't been at the site for over 150 years.</p>

<p>The new herd of longhorn cattle was let out to graze on Wanstead Park, east London, this morning to help maintain rare acid grasslands.</p>

<p>The habitat, which is now threatened and exists only in scattered patches around the capital, supports a wide range of rare and beautiful plants and animals including insects and spiders.</p>

<p>A herd of Longhorn cattle was let out to graze at one of London's oldest parks today</p>

<p>The cows were reintroduced to Wanstead Park in east London for the first time in 150 years to help maintain rare acid grasslands </p>

<p>It is also home to a variety of butterflies including small heath, small copper, and common blue.</p>

<p>These species like the hot ground conditions in the summer and autumn and rely on plant life and seasonal cycles unique to acid grassland.</p>

<p>The park lies on the fringes of Epping Forest, where the cattle have been grazing for the last 1,000 years.</p>

<p>This morning's reintroduction of cattle marks the start of The City of London Corporation's two-month trial across September and October to help conserve the species that live on the grade-II listed park.</p>

<p>To avoid having to use unattractive electric fences, the cattle will be stopped from wandering too far by using an invisible fencing collar system</p>

<p>Graeme Doshi-Smith, chairman of the City of London Corporation's Epping Forest and Commons Committee, said: 'Our grazing pilot is helping us identify better ways to protect Wanstead Park's historic views at the same time as conserving a wide range of species and supporting an even better ecological balance at the site.</p>

<p>'Grazing is used as a natural way to manage grasslands and meadows across Epping Forest.</p>

<p>'As part of the programme we have prevented encroachment by scrub and more vigorous grasses in favour or rarer plants and herbs, benefitting a whole range of insects and birds. </p>

<p>The park is located near Epping Forest where longhorn cattle have been grazing for centuries</p>

<p>'It is exciting to be grazing heritage cattle here in this East London park, right on the edge of our capital city.'</p>

<p>The habitat is under threat from advancing scrubland and could be lost if it isn't properly managed.</p>

<p>To avoid having to use unattractive electric fences, the cattle will be stopped from wandering too far by a GPS collar system that creates an audio signals when the animals cross an invisible boundary.</p>

<p>While conservationists hope that visitors will enjoy sharing the park with the cows, they ask that people avoid feeding or approaching them.</p>

<p>English Longhorn cattle have grazed in Epping Forest for over a thousand years</p>

<p>For more than a thousand years people have exercised their right to graze cattle on Epping Forest, as part of the commoners right to do so.  </p>

<p>In 1912, there were as many as 972 cattle roaming freely in the forest. </p>

<p>The ancient tradition in Epping Forest took place continuously until the outbreak of BSE (mad cow disease) in the mid 1990s, and no more cattle were released after 1996. </p>

<p>A herd of English Longhorn cattle were re-introduced to graze in an area of Epping Forest at Fairmead and Chingford in 2002 and since then Red poll cattle have also been introduced.  </p>

<p>The importance of their historical link to the forest - dating back thousands of years - was realised, as well as the value of their grazing habits. </p>

<p>Grazing allows more flowers to flourish than mowing and there was a reported loss of some insect species and a decline in others, including butterflies.</p>

<p>Epping Forest was the first open space in the world to use invisible fencing - the buried wire that sends a warning signal to the collars the cattle are wearing - since its introduction in 2011.  </p>

<p>However, those who have lived near the forest for many years will remember the days before the invisible fencing when cattle would take themselves for a walk around the nearby towns and villages. </p>

<p>It was a common sight to see cows wandering up the road and munching on flowers in peoples front gardens.  </p>
