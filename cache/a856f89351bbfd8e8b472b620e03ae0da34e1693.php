<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's seventh heaven for Chelsea with goalkeeper Eduoard Mendy the latest arrival at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has joined the Blues in a £22million transfer from Ligue 1 outfit Rennes - in what will be a major boost to manager Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>Mendy is now expected to become Chelsea's No 1 with Lampard increasingly frustrated at Kepa Arrizabalaga's high-profile mistakes.</p>

<p>Eduoard Mendy is now a Chelsea player having completed his £22million transfer from Rennes</p>

<p>Kepa Arrizabalaga is the Blues current No 1 but he is much-maligned after several mistakes</p>

<p>Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record. </p>

<p>'I am so excited to be joining Chelsea,' Mendy told the club's official website. </p>

<p>'It's a dream for me to be a part of this exciting squad and to work with Frank Lampard and all of his coaching staff. I look forward to meeting my team-mates and can't wait to get started.' </p>

<p>His arrival takes Chelsea's outlay this summer beyond £250m following the purchases of Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva  and Kai Havertz.</p>

<p>On signing Mendy, Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia said: 'As soon as Petr Cech and our technical team identified Edouard as the most suitable goalkeeper to complement our existing group, there was only one player we wanted to bring in. </p>

<p>'Edouard arrives following a season of real success with Rennes, he is ambitious for more, and we welcome him to our club.' </p>
