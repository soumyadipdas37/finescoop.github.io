<p>Chloe has found that her usually forthright husband is sometimes reserved when speaking about what's going on in their lives on the show.</p>

<p>She said: 'When I’m honest, I’m really honest. Because of his time in rugby, James is good at being honest while holding something back and feeding the audience what they want to hear.'</p>

<p>She said: 'I was accused of nepotism because I was Richard and Judy’s daughter. It was true, therefore it hurt. Now I’ve built up my own thing, I feel a lot stronger'</p>

<p>The couple aren't worried about any criticism they may receive from putting themselves out there with James saying it's 'water off a duck's back'.    </p>

<p>Chloe, who married James in 2018, previously took to Instagram to reveal how they were coping during lockdown as she admitted that all relationships take 'hard work' to make it work.</p>

<p>She sweetly added: 'I love you James, thank you for making me laugh my ass off every day.'</p>
