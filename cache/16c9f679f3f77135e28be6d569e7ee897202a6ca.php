<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham are reportedly set to meet with Napoli and Arkadiusz Milik's agent in London today to negotiate a deal over the striker's potential transfer.</p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho is desperate to bring in a striker in the closing stages of the summer transfer window to provide back-up for England international Harry Kane.</p>

<p>And according to Calciomercato, both Tottenham and Napoli - plus Milik's agent - will meet to try and thrash out a deal.</p>

<p>Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik has reportedly emerged as a target for Tottenham this summer</p>

<p>The Poland striker appeared to be on his way to Roma this summer, signing on loan with an obligation to buy for £16.5m plus up to £6m in add-ons and bonuses.</p>

<p>However, that move collapsed after Milik took too long to come to an agreement over his departure from the Serie A outfit.</p>

<p>There are reportedly a number of issues that need to be resolved between the player and the club, regarding outstanding wages, fines and image rights. </p>

<p>Reports suggest that if Tottenham were to launch an offer of £17.5m plus £6m in bonuses, then a deal could be struck this summer.</p>

<p>Milik joined Napoli back in 2016 from Dutch side Ajax, and has gone on to feature 122 times for the club - scoring 48 goals and providing five assists.  </p>
