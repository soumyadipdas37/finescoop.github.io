<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One of Australia's biggest banks has launched a credit card with no interest charges or late fees. </p>

<p>NAB's StraightUp Card allows consumers to pay the same fee every month.</p>

<p>A customer with a $3,000 limit incurs a $20 monthly fee on the understanding they pay off a minimum $110 each month from their credit card.</p>

<p>NAB has launched a credit card with no interest charges or late fees - but the bank will block your account if you do not meet minimum repayment amounts</p>

<p>Someone with a $1,000 limit must pay off $35 a month, which includes a monthly $10 fee.</p>

<p>A borrower with a $2,000 limit must pay off $75 a month, taking in a standard $15 charge.</p>

<p>Unlike traditional credit cards, this National Australia Bank product doesn't keep charging interest the longer a bill remains unpaid.</p>

<p>The StraightUp credit card, however, blocks any customer who has missed a payment.</p>

<p>'Customers are required to pay the minimum payment or the card may be blocked,' a NAB spokeswoman said.      </p>

<p>'When customers have missed a payment, they will be alerted and contacted by NAB as with our existing products.' </p>

<p>Customers can set up payment reminders using internet banking and will also receive SMS reminders three days out from their due date.  </p>

<p>'There’s a lot we can do to help and urge customers to contact us as soon as possible if they are struggling to meet payments,' the spokeswoman said. </p>

<p>There are also no foreign currency fees.      </p>
