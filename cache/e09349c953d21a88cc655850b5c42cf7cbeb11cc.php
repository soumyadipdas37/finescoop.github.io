<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Virgil Van Dijk made his third mistake directly leading to a goal since the start of the 2018-19 season in Liverpool's 4-3 win over Leeds - and no player has managed more.</p>

<p>The Liverpool defender miscontrolled Mateus Klich's ball forward which then fell into the path of Patrick Bamford who poked home to level the scores at 2-2. </p>

<p>While it was his third blunder in 77 league matches for the Reds, according to Squawka, Van Dijk's error count is up there with some of the clumsiest players in the league. </p>

<p>Virgil Van Dijk's error versus Leeds (above) was the third mistake he has made since 2018-19</p>

<p>Patrick Bamford picked up Van Dijk's horror touch to level the scores at 2-2 in the first-half</p>

<p>Arsenal defender David Luiz has the same amount of mistakes leading to a goal as the Dutch defender, though has managed the feat in 69 games. </p>

<p>Danny Rose also has three mistakes to his name since 2018 and is nearing an exit to Tottenham this year.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the entire Chelsea backline which conceded 54 goals last season - more than anyone in the top ten - have also registered three mistakes in the past two seasons. </p>

<p>David Luiz (middle) and the entire Chelsea defence have also made three errors since then</p>

<p>The previous mistake Van Dijk had made in the Premier League before Saturday's win over Leeds came in Liverpool's defeat to Arsenal back in July. </p>

<p>The Dutchman gave the ball away to Reiss Nelson and the ball fell to Alexandre Lacazette who rounded Alisson for a simple tap-in to level the scores. </p>

<p>Nelson then struck again for the Gunners after more slack defending later on in the game as the Premier League champions spurned the opportunity to achieve an all-time record points total. </p>

<p>Van Dijk's previous defensive mishap came in a 2-1 defeat to Arsenal for Alex Lacazette's goal</p>

<p>His first error in a Liverpool shirt came via a dodgy backpass header against Fulham (above)</p>

<p>His first top-flight error in a Liverpool shirt came away to Fulham in March 2019. The Dutch defender headed a slack ball back to Alisson which was intercepted by ex-Reds winger Ryan Babal who also had a simple finish.</p>

<p>According to Opta Sports, who supply data to Squawka, describes a defensive error as 'a mistake made by a player losing the ball that leads to a shot or a goal.'</p>

<p>Overall, Van Dijk has made 124 appearances for the Reds and has helped them win the 2019 Champions League title and the Premier League in 2020.  </p>
