<p>Fans were quick to point out how many posts she had done from this day, one wrote 'Hello number 20!!! 20th repost!!! It’s almost like Britney isn’t alive for them to make new content lol.' </p>

<p>'How many of these did you take in one day girl,' another asked. While a fellow commenter added 'We want a live!.' </p>

<p>We've seen this: Fans were quick to point out how many posts she had done from this day, one wrote 'Hello number 20!!! 20th repost!!! It’s almost like Britney isn’t alive for them to make new content lol' (posted August 10)</p>

<p>Go live: 'How many of these did you take in one day girl,' another asked. While a fellow commenter added 'We want a live' (original post August 3)</p>

<p>Other comments suggested it wasn't Britney posting and was her 'team' or boyfriend Sam Asghari.  </p>

<p>Three days after he original August 3 post she shared a full length video, showing she was wearing white shorts with the video, she wrote 'What can I say …I really like my new top.'</p>

<p>A week after her original post, she also posted six photos with two originals and each photo with two different filters, and used the same caption she used on Monday. </p>

<p>Again in August, fans notified she had posted in the same outfit and hairstyle multiple times and wrote 'Just so you guys know these aren’t old ... check the date at the top of the 2nd pic.' </p>

<p>Playing it off: Three days after he original August 3 post she shared a full length video, showing she was wearing white shorts with the video, she wrote 'What can I say …I really like my new top' (posted Aug 13)</p>

<p>Claims: When fans continued to point out she was largely posting photos from the same few photoshoots, she wrote 'to the peeps who think I’m posting the same pics …… well you know us girls …... it’s the same top and same hair but if you look at the details it’s a completely different picture,' on September 1, referring to the different angles (posted August 7)</p>

<p>The caption referenced them as being from August 6, despite originally being posted August 3 and that post being on August 14. </p>

<p>By August 21, she continued to post in the same outfit and hairstyle, but added roses to her hair and began calling it her 'Just a Touch of Rose,' series.  </p>

<p>When fans continued to point out she was largely posting photos from the same few photoshoots, she wrote 'to the peeps who think I’m posting the same pics …… well you know us girls …... it’s the same top and same hair but if you look at the details it’s a completely different picture,' on September 1, referring to the different angles. </p>

<p>Though, the following day she changed her story saying 'this was shot last month …. so were the pics with the flower crown ...... yes I shot a lot of footage because I have been loving my hair these day,' again over photos from the same day. </p>

<p>Change of tune: Though, the following day she changed her story saying 'this was shot last month …. so were the pics with the flower crown ...... yes I shot a lot of footage because I have been loving my hair these day,' again over photos from the same day (posted August 19)</p>

<p>Free Britney: Fans use the frequent reposting as proof of the Free Britney movement which is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers </p>

<p>Earlier this month, her attorney filed court documents on her behalf in an attempt to make public sealed parts of her legal case and stated that the Free Britney movement was not 'a conspiracy theory or a joke', TMZ reported. </p>

<p>The viral movement is popular among Britney's fans who believe that the pop star is being held 'hostage' and controlled by her caretakers. </p>

<p>Spears' lawyer filed documents to oppose Britney's dad Jamie's motion to seal parts of his daughters conservatorship case, according to TMZ. </p>

<p>'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote.  </p>

<p>The why: A principal motivation for the changes Britney is seeking appears to be her desire to no longer continue performing; she has not performed live since October 2018 (Pictured on tour in August 2018)</p>

<p>The legal filing also included the icon's stance on the Free Britney movement, popular among her fans. </p>

<p>Many fans have been using online petitions, social media posts and even some in-person protests to call for the Womanizer crooner to be released from her conservatorship.</p>

<p>'[Britney] welcomes and appreciates the informed support of her many fans,' her lawyer penned on her behalf. </p>

<p>Spears' dad Jamie, who has been in control of the conservatorship since its inception, has previously tried to shut down the controversial movement as illegitimate.   </p>

<p>'Britney herself is vehemently opposed to this effort by her father to keep her legal struggle hidden away in the closet as a family secret,' Britney's legal team wrote (Jamie pictured in 2008 when the conservatorship was put in place)</p>

<p>The court document stated of Free Britney: 'Far from being a conspiracy theory or a 'joke' as James [Jamie] reportedly told the media, in large part this scrutiny is a reasonable and even predictable result of James' aggressive use of the sealing procedure over the years to minimize the amount of meaningful information made available to the public.'  </p>

<p>That line seemed to be in direct response to an interview that Britney's dad gave last month in an effort to curtail the movement.</p>

<p>'All these conspiracy theorists don't know anything,' Jamie told PageSix.</p>

<p> Earlier this summer the Free Britney frenzy reached a fever pitch when a legion of her fans became convinced that her social media videos were old and being shared by her team to try to 'fake' that she is okay.</p>
