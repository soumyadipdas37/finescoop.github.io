<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson is planning to start a late-stage clinical trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine in up to 60,000 people worldwide in late September.</p>

<p>If the company hits the enrollment aim, which was reported on a US government database, it would be the largest-ever study looking at a possible immunization for the virus.</p>

<p>Rival companies, such as Moderna Inc and Pfizer Inc, are only recruiting half as many volunteers, about 30,000 each for their respective late-stage studies.</p>

<p>A J&amp;J spokesman told The Wall Street Journal the company wants 'to enroll a robust number of participants who are representative of those populations affected by COVID-19.'  </p>

<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson plans to start its late-stage trial for its experimental coronavirus vaccine in September with up 60,000 people.

<p>The enrollment aim is much larger than rival companies, such as Moderna, that have enrolled about 30,000 people for their studies. Pictured: Johnson &amp; Johnson headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, August 1</p>

<p>According to The Journal, the trial will be conducted at 180 locations in the US and eight other countries including Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and South Africa.</p>

<p>In the US, locations will be in 28 states such as California, Florida, Texas, the states with the most cases and among the highest transmission rates.</p>

<p>The spokesman said the New Jersey-based company hopes the trial will also determine safety, efficacy and the proper amount of dosing. </p>

<p>Subjects will be followed for at least two years but preliminary results will be published much sooner. </p>

<p>Dr William Schaffner, who is not part of the trial, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said determining if the jab is effective could be easier with more subjects. </p>

<p>'It will certainly speed up the evaluation process,' he told The Journal.</p>

<p>The timeline is quite surprising given that J&amp;J only recently began phase I clinical trials, testing safety and efficacy for a one-dose and two-dose jab, in the US and Belgium.</p>

<p>This places the company behind others such as AstraZeneca, Moderna and Pfizer, which have started phase III clinical trials looking at large-scale volunteer use and examines if the vaccine is better than what's already available.  </p>

<p>J&amp;J's vaccines combines genetic material from the new virus with the genes of the adenovirus - which causes the common cold - to induce an immune response.</p>

<p>It is the same technology the company used to make an experimental Ebola vaccine for people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2019.  </p>

<p>Shares of the company rose marginally on Thursday, paring their earlier losses, after The Journal first reported the news. </p>

<p>The developments comes on the heels of news that US government will pay J&amp;J more than $1 billion in exchange for 100 million doses of its potential coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>It's the latest move by the Trump administration as it stocks up on inoculations and drugs in an attempt to tame the pandemic that has killed 173,000 Americans.</p>

<p>The latest contract is priced at roughly $10 per vaccine dose, including a previous $456 million the government promised to J&amp;J for vaccine development in March.</p>

<p>That compares with the $19.50 per dose the US is paying for the immunization being developed by Pfizer and German biotech BioNTech SE.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the jab being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford is estimated to cost between $3 and $4 per dose.  </p>

<p>According to the World Health Organization, more than 100 COVID-19 vaccines are under development around the world and at least 23 are in human trials.</p>
