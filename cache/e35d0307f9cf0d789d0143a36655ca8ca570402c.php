<p>The outside fabric is waterproof, breathable and windproof to keep you dry and comfortable outdoors, while the hood and cuffs are lined with a faux fur for extra snug appeal. </p>

<p>While rain jackets aren't typically the most flattering of coat styles, the Regatta Romina Jacket has impressed shoppers.

<p>One shopper wrote in their review: 'This jacket is everything I hoped for when I bought it. It’s a good length, a flattering fit, warm, and waterproof. It has a zip that can be unzipped from the bottom up, as well as the more traditional from the top down.'</p>

<p>Another reviewer added: 'I'm 5'7 and the coat comes down to my knees. It is warm, windproof and waterproof but doesn't have the bulkiness of others I've seen. </p>

<p>'It has ample secure pockets and can be pulled in at the waist if required. The hood can also be drawn in to make it nice &amp; cosy.'</p>

<p>The waterproof coat has been designed with clever hand-warmer pockets, a hood and faux fur lining to make it extra cosy </p>

<p>The durable water-repellent finish makes the jacket perfectly suited to long autumnal walks but, thanks to the flattering mid-length cut, it's stylish enough to throw over any outfit. </p>

<p>Those shoppers that have invested in the Regatta brand have become loyal followers and repeat buyers, impressed with both the quality and the price.  </p>

<p>One wrote: 'I have bought regatta coats/jkts for years and can't fault them, the sizing is true to size and the quality is excellent. The romina jkt is suitable for spring or autumn weather as it is not as thick as some of the other regatta jkts but it is water repellent so a very useful jkt to purchase.' </p>
