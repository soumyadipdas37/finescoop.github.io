<p>Michael Cohen says President Donald Trump believed Russian leader Vladimir Putin was behind the sale of his languishing Palm Beach Mansion that saw him pocket a $54million profit in 2008</p>

<p>'I don’t know what he was thinking….He believes that all of the Russian oligarchs are basically pawns of Vladimir Putin, he believes he controls all of them,' Cohen said on The Rachel Maddow Show last week.</p>

<p>Cohen detailed Trump’s belief that Putin secretly funded the deal in his new book Disloyal: A Memior, which was released on September 8. </p>

<p>Cohen, the disbarred lawyer who served as an attorney for Trump from 2006 to 2018 was sentenced to three years in jail in 2018 for tax evasion and campaign finance violations.</p>

<p>In May he was released early due to concerns regarding the pandemic to serve the rest of his sentence under house arrest. </p>

<p>'Trump is keen on this power and whether its Putin, Mohammed bin Salman, Kim Jong Un, it’s the power that he’s so involved with and so in search of, that this is exactly what he believes,' Cohen said of Trump on the show.</p>

<p>'He believes that Putin controls all of Russia and all of its wealth and anything, like the purchase of this home, had to be with the permission of Vladimir Putin,' he added. </p>

<p>The 'dodgy' Palm Beach mansion deal reportedly was investigated in the Mueller report into Trump but its findings weren’t released in the final report.  </p>

<p>Cohen says that Trump has a genuine admiration for the Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his power. Cohen said: 'He believes that all of the Russian oligarchs are basically pawns of Vladimir Putin, he believes he controls all of them'</p>

<p>As revealed in court records, Trump had dispatched Cohen to try to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, a 120-story building in the Red Square that would include a free penthouse for Putin. </p>

<p>Trump’s relationship with Russia has faced scrutiny time and time again in his election and presidency.</p>

<p>Cohen writes in his book that the Trump campaign didn’t need to conspire in the Russian election interference effort, all Trump had to do was sit back and reap the benefits.</p>

<p>'What appeared to be collusion was really a confluence of shared interests in harming Hillary Clinton in any way possible, up to and including interfering in the American election — a subject that caused Trump precisely zero unease,' Cohen writes in his book.  </p>
