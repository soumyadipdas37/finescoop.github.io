<p>Depressed people's hearts beat an extra ten to 15 times per minute on average during the daytime, a study has found.</p>

<p>Their heart rates fell at night – which is normal as we recover from the stresses and strains of the day – but less so than people who were not depressed.</p>

<p>Scientists discovered this after tracking the heart rates of 16 people with depression and 16 who were not depressed over four days and three nights.</p>

<p>They were able to predict who had depression, based on their heart rate alone, in up to 90 per cent of cases.</p>

<p>Experts believe that depressed people's hearts may have to work harder because their chronic stress or anxiety means that they are constantly in a low-level state of 'fight or flight'.</p>

<p>Inflammation in the body caused by poor mental health may also reduce activity of the vagus nerve, which helps to regulate heart rate. </p>

<p>The findings mean people could detect early signs of poor mental health in themselves by using a 24-hour fitness tracker to chart their heart rate.</p>

<p>Dr Carmen Schiweck, who led the study at Goethe University in Germany, said: 'Normally heart rates are higher during the day and lower during the night.</p>

<p>'Interestingly, it seems that the drop in heart rate during the night is impaired in depression. This seems to be a way of identifying patients who are at risk to develop depression or to relapse.'</p>

<p>Study volunteers, who were a similar age in the depressed and non-depressed groups, wore miniature echocardiogram patches on their chest to monitor their heart rate day and night.</p>

<p>Previous evidence had shown that depressed people did have higher heart rates, but this latest research found that the difference is up to 15 more beats a minute throughout the day.</p>

<p>For the first time, it emerged that people's heart rates fell less at night if they were depressed.</p>

<p>Daytime heart rates, which also fluctuated less in those with depression, could be used to predict the condition with 81 per cent accuracy.</p>

<p>Night-time heart rates were better, achieving an accuracy of 90.6 per cent when a computer programme analysed the readings to provide a diagnosis.</p>

<p>The authors of the study, which was presented at the virtual conference of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology, caution that heart rate may provide a red flag for depression only in those who are very depressed.</p>

<p>The volunteers in the study, diagnosed by a doctor, had tried two types of antidepressants which did not work.</p>

<p>But if people can predict depression early, they can take action – by doing more exercise or seeking counselling – to try to cope better.</p>

<p>If depression alters the heart rate so significantly, this may help to explain its link with coronary artery disease and heart failure.</p>
