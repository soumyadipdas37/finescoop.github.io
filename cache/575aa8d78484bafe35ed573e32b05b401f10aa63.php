<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump will fly back to Washington, D.C. to visit his hotel for just 85 minutes for a campaign fundraiser on a day that takes him to three swing states. </p>

<p>The president woke up in Florida at his Trump National Doral Miami and hosted a 'Latinos for Trump' roundtable before heading to Georgia, back to D.C., and then onto Virginia for a Friday night rally.  </p>

<p>'So I'm thrilled to be back in Doral, I never knew if I was gonna even see it again, this is nice,' he told a crowd at his a.m. campaign event. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump will hit three swing states on Friday: Florida, Georgia and Virginia - and stop back in Washington, D.C. for a fundraiser. He started his day at his Miami Doral property participating in a 'Latinos for Trump' event</p>

<p>After a stop in Atlanta, Georgia Friday afternoon, President Donald Trump is scheduled to spend 85 minutes at his Washington, D.C. hotel to participate in a roundtable with supporters before heading to Virginia for a rally Friday night </p>

<p>The president hit his political rival, Joe Biden, telling the crowd the Democrat 'sold out the Hispanic American community' by offshoring jobs. </p>

<p>Trump referred to himself as a 'wall' - like the wall he's trying to construct between the United States and Mexico. </p>

<p>'I'm like a wall between the American dream ... between the American dream and chaos, and a horror show,' the president said.   </p>

<p>He also predicted that he would win the 2020 presidential election, citing a number of polls at the top of his remarks.  </p>

<p>'I think we're going to win it big,' Trump said.   </p>

<p>Nationally, Biden has a 6.6 point edge, according to the Real Clear Politics polling average. In Florida, polling shows the race extremely tight, with the RCP average giving Biden a slight edge of 1.3 points. </p>

<p>Playing to his audience, he called the Russia investigation into his 2016 campaign a 'coup.' </p>

<p>'And you know, you never think of this country as a coup,' Trump said. 'You think of certain South American countries for coups.'  </p>

<p>From Miami the president will travel to Atlanta, Georgia - a state Democrats want to flip this cycle - where he'll deliver remarks on 'Black Economic Empowerment.'</p>

<p>He then returns to Washington, D.C., and is scheduled to spent 85 minutes at his Pennsylvania Avenue hotel.</p>

<p>He's slated to attend a roundtable with supporters. </p>

<p>And the schedule seemingly gives him time to eat dinner as well. </p>

<p>Biden and the Democrats significanly outraised the president and Republicans last month.  </p>

<p>The president will then get back on Air Force One to fly to Newport News, Virginia for a 9 p.m. campaign rally.  </p>

<p>While Virginia is likely to stay blue, Newport News is close enough to the North Carolina media market, for the president to benefit there too. </p>

<p>President Donald Trump held a rally in Jacksonville, Florida Thursday night where he mocked Joe Biden for having a lighter campaign schedule than the president, who's held large rallies despite the coronavirus pandemic </p>

<p>He made a stop in Charlotte, North Carolina Thursday to give a speech on healthcare before his Thursday night rally in Jacksonville, Florida. </p>

<p>He held rallies on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, travels to Virginia Friday night, and then heads to Pennsylvania Saturday night after nominating a new Supreme Court justice. </p>

<p>Biden, on the other hand, has kept his campaign events small, his schedule light and continues to greet donors virtually, due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>The president has interpreted Biden's caution as evidence the candidate is 'low energy.' </p>

<p>'Did you see he did a lid this morning again? Lid. Lid. Do you know what a lid is?' Trump asked his crowd Thursday night in Jacksonville. 'A lid is when you put out the word that you're not going to be campaigning today. That he won't be working today.' </p>

<p>The former vice president was prepping for his Tuesday debate with Trump.  </p>

<p>Trump suggested Biden could be 'right' when it came to this tactic. </p>

<p>'Think of it, supposing he never campaigns and he wins, do you know how badly I'm going to feel?' he asked the audience. 'I'm working hard.'  </p>
