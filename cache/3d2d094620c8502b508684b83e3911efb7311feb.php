<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Sainsbury's security guard had a painfully boring day at work recently - so much so that he decided to jump a barrier.</p>

<p>However, he fails to make the jump and ends up toppling backwards onto his head in what looks like an excruciatingly painful fall. </p>

<p>His attempt was caught on video and has been watched almost 400k times on Twitter with users scoring his jump skills and 'aspiration'.</p>

<p>The video shows the security man outside a Sainsbury's story wearing his full uniform. </p>

<p>He readies himself before he makes the jump, eyeing up the height of the plastic orange barrier. </p>

<p>With a huge athletic effort, he leaps on top of the barrier but his feet slip and he loses his balance. </p>

<p>He  flips backwards, in a 360 turn, landing painfully on his head.</p>

<p>One Twitter user jokingly gave the jump a score out of ten, writing: '8/10 on jump height but 0 on the landing.'</p>

<p>Ruth Topham on Twitter, credited the security man's efforts to scale the barrier, writing: '10 out of 10 for aspiration.' </p>

<p>However, Tom Pine was more concerned for the plastic barrier involved, joking: 'I hope the barrier is ok.'</p>
