<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new poll suggests the race for the White House between Democratic nominee Joe Biden and President Donald Trump is getting closer in the battleground state of Florida with just a 2 point gap between the two candidates.</p>

<p>Biden has the edge of Trump, 48 percent to 46 percent according to a new poll by CBS News that was published on Sunday. </p>

<p>The survey, conducted earlier this month between September 15 and 18th asked 1,200 voters who they would be voting for. </p>

<p>Florida remains a close battleground state in the presidential election with the current margin between Trump and Biden just 2 percentage points</p>

<p>Trump narrowly won Florida by just over 100,000 votes in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and will almost certainly need it this time around too </p>

<p>The poll's 3.7 percent margin of error still sees Biden taking the lead in the Sunshine State.</p>

<p>Some 5 per cent of voters also say they are still 'not sure' whom they wish to vote for.</p>

<p>Although Biden is still out in front, his lead appears to have been diminished somewhat after a poll in July showed him to be 6 points in front.   </p>

<p>In terms of demographics, Trump is leading among white people likely to vote in Florida with 59 percent suggesting they will vote for the president. </p>

<p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads Trump up by 2 points in the Sunshine State</p>

<p>However, Biden appears to have a lead among Hispanic voters, by a similar margin -  56 percent compared to Trump's 36 percent.</p>

<p>Trump narrowly carried the state in 2016 49% to Hillary Clinton who secured 47%. </p>

<p>The state is just as likely to be just as crucial this time around if the Democrats are to be successful at voting Trump out of office.  </p>

<p>The economy appears to be one of the most important issues for voters with many of those surveyed believing Trump's policies to be aiding a recovery with potential voters saying they feel the president's economic policies would better help their family's financial situation than Biden's proposals.   </p>

<p>Also, despite coronavirus cases still rising, Florida voters appear to feel more positive about efforts to combat the virus than efforts earlier in the summer although largely among party lines.  </p>
