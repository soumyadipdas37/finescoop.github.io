<p>Admitting that she could have easily succumbed to her anger and grief, Demi said: 'When my parents died my world could have spiralled out of control but you have to hang on.'</p>

<p>She went on to say that she was helped greatly by doing a lot of self-care and reading books about 'spirituality' and 'enlightenment', while she tried to look at her tragedy as part of 'life's plan'.</p>

<p>Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.  </p>

<p>She went on: 'Behind closed doors there's been a lot of torment and I suppose I have turned that into a positive as I feel I have been through so much nothing can push me down again'.</p>

<p>The social media sensation Demi also opened up about her mental health in the interview, and admitted it played a part in her recent move to Ibiza. </p>

<p>She explained: 'During lockdown I lived on my own in London and my mental health really did get the better of me. I had up and down days and with so much time on my hands I obviously had a lot of time to reflect on things.'</p>

<p>After battling her sadness while confined at home, when lockdown restrictions were eased, she made the decision to relocate to Spain, a decision she states is one of the 'best choices' she's ever made. </p>

<p>Demi also suggested that the sunshine and abundance of friends she has in Ibiza have helped her immensely. </p>

<p>Earlier this year, the brunette beauty revealed she is 'healing' from her parents' deaths following a tough year.  </p>

<p>The Birmingham native explained how their tragic deaths made her 'grow up really fast' as she opened up about dealing with grief during the recording of her PrettyLittleThing podcast episode.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've lost both of my parents, my dad cancer and my mum had a heart attack which caused a stroke when I was 17 and I was left as her carer as she was left disabled.</p>

<p>Heartache: The star revealed how she was forced to 'grow up' from a young age after her mother was left disabled following a heart attack, resulting in a then 17-year-old becoming her carer </p>

<p>'I was caring for her for so many years, about seven years,' explained the social media star.  </p>

<p>Demi then went into detail about the impact the death of her parents had on her and how she aims to help others experiencing the same thing.</p>

<p>She explained: 'Then my dad passed away with cancer and then my mum then sadly passed away seven months after him with a stomach infection, and it just made me grow up really fast and be really really strong about things.</p>

<p>'And I think if I can inspire people by talking about grief, then you know if they can relate to me and they can understand it a little bit and I can help them then that's important to me.' </p>

<p>After experiencing the loss of both of her parents, Demi admitted: 'I've gone through a lot, so I can talk on it.</p>

<p>'I feel like nothing can really affect me now, nothing can really make me feel a certain way - I've gone through it all.' </p>
