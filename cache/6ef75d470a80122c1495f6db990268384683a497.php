<p>What a babe! The Victoria's Secret star continued to turn heads by switching into a shiny tasselled slip dress, as well as another co-ord set</p>

<p>Irina shares 50/50 joint legal and physical custody of her daughter Lea with her ex-partner Bradley Cooper, according to TMZ. </p>

<p>And while the former couple officially ended their four-year romance in June 2019, the amicable exes were spotted embracing each other earlier this month. </p>

<p>Screen star Bradley, 45, is on break from filming his role as Barbra Streisand's hairdresser-turned-movie producer Jon Peters in Paul Thomas Anderson's untitled seventies San Fernando Valley-set flick. </p>

<p>The couple haven't let the end of their romance or their busy schedules interfere with their co-parenting.</p>

<p>There are still challenges because he does have a very busy schedule and she's back at work now so there are times they have to compromise, and they do,' a source told HollywoodLife in March. </p>

<p>'He's been making an effort to take projects that aren't too far from New York so he can be there to share custody, he's very committed. And so protective, if it were up to him he'd carry her everywhere.'</p>

<p>'He's totally devoted to Lea, it's really sweet to see how much he loves being a dad,' the insider went on. </p>
