<p>Astra Space Inc made its first attempt to launch a rocket into orbit on Friday in Kodiak, Alaska</p>

<p>Video showed the 38-foot-tall rocket taking off from the Pacific Spaceport Complex at 7.19pm local time and flying for about 30 seconds before it veered off course and fizzled out</p>

<p>The rocket created a fiery explosion as it landed in a designated crash area</p>

<p>Astra is among a number of space start-ups working to create small, low cost rockets that can be sent into orbit on a daily basis. </p>

<p>Friday's flight marked the first of three scheduled to take place in the coming months as Astra aims to work out kinks with its hardware and software. </p>

<p>The first-time failure was unsurprising given that other companies have seen similar issued with debut flights. </p>

<p>Competitor SpaceX - founded by Tesla CEO Elon Musk - experienced similar growing pains when it started sending up rockets and took four tries to find success.  </p>

<p>After hearing about Astra's launch, Musk offered support on Twitter. </p>

<p>'Sorry to hear that. I'm sure you'll figure it out though,' he wrote. 'Took us four launches to reach orbit. Rockets are hard.'</p>

<p>SpaceX founder Elon Musk shared his support for Astra on Twitter</p>

<p>The founder and CEO of Rocket Lab - the only company that has managed to conduct successful commercial flights - also shared encouragement.  </p>

<p>'Data in this game is so hard won, so big congratulations to the team for pulling down actual flight data from today's attempt!' Peter Beck tweeted.  </p>

<p>Astra had said beforehand that it was not expecting perfection the first time around, as it hopes to achieve orbit within three flights.</p>

<p>The goal for the first flight was to achieve a nominal first-stage burn. While that didn't happen, the company said that it did gain valuable insights going into the second attempt.  </p>

<p>'We didn't meet all of our objectives, but we did gain valuable experience, plus even more valuable flight data,' company representatives wrote in the blog post. </p>

<p>'This launch sets us well on our way to reaching orbit within two additional flights, so we're happy with the result.'</p>

<p>Astra had said beforehand that it was not expecting perfection the first time around, as it hopes to achieve orbit within three flights</p>

<p>Astra co-founder and CEO Chris Kemp praised the launch, saying that systems worked as expected and fed ample information back for engineers to plan the next flight.  </p>

<p>'Obviously, it didn't do everything we wanted it to, but it launched, and we got a ton of great data,' Kemp said. </p>

<p>'We learned things that we would not otherwise learn unless we flew.' </p>

<p>Fellow Astra founder Adam London, the company's chief technology officer, said that early findings indicated an issue with the rocket's guidance and navigation software.  </p>

<p>When the rocket began to veer off course, a safety officer shut off its engines to ensure that it would land in a designated safety zone, the company said. </p>

<p>London assured that the crash wouldn't cause any lasting environmental issues.  </p>

<p>'Our rocket doesn't have any toxic propellants,' he said. 'It is quite a benign thing environmentally.'</p>

<p>Adam London, Astra's co-founder and chief technology officer, assured that the crash wouldn't cause any lasting environmental issues</p>

<p>Astra is aiming to build a simpler rocket than other companies in the field that could significantly undercut competitors on price. </p>

<p>Rocket Lab, the current market leader, charges about $7.5million per flight, while Astra says its rockets would cost just $1million per flight.  </p>

<p>Astra had hoped to be further along in the trial process but its timeline has been disrupted on several occasions this year - including by bad weather and the pandemic. </p>

<p>It's second rocket is already waiting in the wings for round two, which likely won't take place for a few months as engineers analyze what when wrong with the first launch.  </p>
