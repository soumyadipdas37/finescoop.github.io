<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Captain Sir Tom Moore has lent his support to Lloyd Scott as he plans to climb the Three Peaks wearing a 130lb deep-sea diving suit.</p>

<p>Mr Scott, 58, will be climbing Britain's three tallest mountains over an eight-day period next month.</p>

<p>It comes 18 years after he earned the world record for slowest time to complete a marathon while wearing the same suit - with a time of five days, eight hours, 29 minutes and 46 seconds.</p>

<p>The ascent of Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Mount Snowdon will be Mr Scott's final charity challenge, after raising over £5 million across 30 years for charitable causes.</p>

<p>Captain Tom and Mr Scott chatted during the visit ahead of Mr Scott's final fundraising challenge next month</p>

<p>Captain Tom met Mr Scott at his home in Marston Moretaine, Bedford, and even won a short race against the veteran fundraiser in his diving suit.</p>

<p>Mr Scott told MailOnline: 'It’s been fantastic to meet Captain Tom. It’s a real thrill.</p>

<p>'It was kind of coming up with something to say that hasn’t been said. For me the biggest accolade that I could think of was that he brought the very best out of humanity.</p>

<p>'To have someone like him supporting and endorsing my challenge, it was very special.</p>

<p>'We had a race. He’s such a gentleman, he didn’t want to go in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr Scott (pictured as the suit's helmet was placed over his head) raced a marathon in the suit in 2002. He earned the world record for slowest marathon after five days, eight hours, 29 minutes and 46 seconds</p>

<p>Mr Scott (pictured in the suit with Captain Tom) told MailOnline: 'It’s been fantastic to meet Captain Tom'</p>

<p>'Everyone’s had a very difficult time this year. With my specific brand of fundraising, if I could put a smile on the face of the nation it might lift peoples spirits.' </p>

<p>Mr Scott's first charity challenge was the 1987 London Marathon, which he completed after being diagnosed with leukaemia. </p>

<p>He has since completed an Everest marathon, an underwater marathon, and cycled a Penny Farthing across Australia.</p>

<p>'I needed the finality of saying an event was my last and I was going out on top,' Mr Scott said.</p>

<p>Former cricketer David Gower speaks to Captain Tom at the launch event for the Lloyd Scott Three Peaks Challenge</p>

<p>Social distancing was maintained as former cricketer Mr Gower spoke to Mr Scott about his upcoming challenge</p>

<p>'The last I had done was the Malden mud race in 2014. It took seven guys tying a rope around me to get me over the line, so I wasn't going out on that.'</p>

<p>Mr Scott will start the 23-mile challenge, involving an ascent of 3,064 metres, on October 4.</p>

<p>'Knowing that my family can be there at the end, and that both my boys and brother can come along means so much,' he said.</p>

<p>'Sadly, my dad passed away in February, but I'll have his red fleece that he wore on all his adventures with me.'</p>

<p>Mr Scott will be raising money for The Lord's Taverners, a youth cricket and disability sports charity, which he has been a member of for 15 years.</p>

<p>The pair enjoyed a distanced conversation with Captain Tom. Mr Scott said his next challenge would be his last</p>

<p>'When I had leukaemia, there was a period where I couldn't play any sport. It's only when you have something, and it's taken away from you and that you realise how important it is,' he said.</p>

<p>'The thought of children out there that may not experience the thrill, excitement, enjoyment of sport really resonates with me. I couldn't think of anyone I wanted to do this for more.'</p>

<p>Due to Covid-19 restrictions, Sir Tom will not be joining Mr Scott at any stage of the challenge. </p>
