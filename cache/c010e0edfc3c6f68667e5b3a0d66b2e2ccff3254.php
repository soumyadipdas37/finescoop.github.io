<p>Floyd, 46, died on May 25 after a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck during arrest for almost nine minutes.</p>

<p>Amid the uproar, one man commented: 'I would not like to be Shauna Kinville today. I honestly can’t believe someone would go on the news and actually say something so stupid.'</p>

<p>Another woman described the episode as profoundly depressing, and a damning indictment of the United States.  </p>

<p>'This is depressing. I cannot even begin to address the George Floyd comment - no logic at all. The level of selfishness and self centered behavior...' she said.</p>
