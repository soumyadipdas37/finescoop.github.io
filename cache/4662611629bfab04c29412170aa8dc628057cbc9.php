<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The most visible part of the bed (in which the average person spends a third of his or her life) is, curiously, often the most ignored.</p>

<p>It's a shame, since a headboard isn't merely decorative: it plays an important function in rest and relaxation. </p>

<p>It serves as a cushion for when we're sitting up in bed watching TV, reading or browsing on a mobile before nodding off — and it keeps walls from getting dirty. </p>

<p>Statement piece: The Lucifer’s horn king-sized headboard by Andrew Martin is from £1,195</p>

<p>We've come a long way from the bubblegum-pink, satin-padded creations of the Eighties. But upholstered, eye-catching designs are back. </p>

<p>'We are seeing more clients being daring with their design choices,' says Emma Deterding, founder and creative director of Kelling Designs (­kellingdesigns.com) and KDLoves. 'Big, bold shapes in bright colours and patterned fabrics being a go-to choice.' </p>

<p>SIZE MATTERS</p>

<p>Deciding on size, shape and finishings — as well as the colour and pattern — is part and parcel of creating your dream headboard. Size matters, say experts who insist you should get the largest one the room can take to give the most impact. </p>

<p>Some of the biggest headboards are even winged to create a sense of scale, as well as a cocoon-like feel. The curved Monroe from Heal's combines sweeping lines with generous proportions. (heals. com, from £779). </p>

<p>Curves are popular for headboards without wings, too, according to Sarah Massouh, founder of Willow &amp; Hall (­willowandhall.co.uk). 'Headboards in shapely designs such as scalloped and curved designs are proving on trend.' </p>

<p>High-end design house Andrew Martin offers clients the choice between a curvaceous feminine shape, a silhouette as tailored as a gentleman's suit, or lines that mimic the eccentric torrents of Lucifer's horn (andrewmartin. co.uk, from £1,195 for a king — they don't offer doubles). </p>

<p>While upholstered headboards are increasingly popular, because they allow you to create a unique look, they can also be reupholstered as trends — and tastes — change. Designer Bethie Tricks (kdloves. com, from £1,400 for a double and £1,600 for kingsize). </p>

<p>Prints are made on sustainable Belgian flax linen and inspired by much that nature has to offer, such as botanical plant structures or cells under a microscope. </p>

<p>With nature and mindfulness being an important factor for many when it comes to bedrooms, there may be temptation to shy away from anything too wild for a headboard. </p>

<p>However, Deterding insists vivid tones, such as shades of pink, blue and green, can be 'just as restful as grey or beige'.</p>

<p>STANDALONE BOARDS</p>

<p>Standalone headboards are a smart purchase as they can be paired with any bed. </p>

<p>At Loaf, all sit on the floor or can be wall-mounted. It has 18 shapes and 155 fabrics to choose from. The Tall Billow headboard ticks the boxes for being oversized and bold — check out spiced orange. (loaf.com, from £625 for a double). </p>

<p>For a bespoke feel, attention to the finishings is a must. Buttoning, piping and studding add those extra eye-catching details that will ensure your headboard makes a real statement. If it's studs you like, try ­Neptune's Eva headboard with its scalloped shape and double line of studs (neptune. com, from £475 for a double).</p>

<p>BUDGET BESPOKE</p>

<p>For those who want to be part of the design process, go bespoke — even if you're working with a tight budget. At many High Street stores, you can choose the shape, height and fabric. </p>

<p>For a bold design, try Next (next.co.uk) for Catherine Lansfield's brightly coloured velvet collection. The chic Boutique Velvet headboards start at £150. At Dunelm (dunelm.com), a velvet headboard starts at £104. </p>

<p>ART ATTACK</p>

<p>If you prefer to read in your favourite armchair rather than your bed, Sue Jones, founder and creative director of Oka (oka.com), suggests using a piece of artwork instead of a headboard. </p>

<p>'Create your own unique headboard with a piece of wall art or even an ornate mirror,' she says. </p>

<p>Fine art lovers can go a step further and get a headboard made from any of the paintings that the National Gallery holds in its permanent collection.</p>

<p>High-end British bed-maker Savoir Beds joined forces with Andrew Martin, which has permission under licence to reproduce paintings within the gallery to be upholstered on to a headboard (and base). </p>

<p>You can sleep in the presence of work from the likes of Monet, Degas, Turner or Rembrandt. </p>

<p>The catch is you have to buy the bed base, and prices start at £16,037 (savoirbeds.com). </p>

<p>Whatever you decide to bring into the bedroom, make sure it delivers the drama that dreams are made of.</p>
