<p>'Currently, the side effects are causing days on end with no sleep and very little energy but I feel that a lifetime of working punishingly long hours in hospitality has weirdly prepared me for chemo,' she continued. </p>

<p>After coming to terms with the 'initial shock' of her diagnosis, the chef decided to turn her battle into something more positive.  </p>

<p>In May, Shannon received some backlash on after appearing on MasterChef Australia to host a vegan challenge.</p>

<p>Judge Melissa Leong pointed out the fact that Shannon is a meat eater, which caused her to awkwardly respond: 'No. I'm not [vegan]. Shock, horror. But I think that lends itself to sort of why I make the food that I make, you know?'</p>

<p>'I'm coming at vegan food from a non-vegan perspective, I guess': In May, Shannon received some backlash on after appearing on MasterChef Australia to host a vegan challenge, despite not being vegan herself</p>

<p>'I'm coming at vegan food from a non-vegan perspective, I guess. Understanding mouthfeel, textures, flavours.' </p>

<p>However, many fans thought it was odd for a chef who specialises in vegan cuisine not to actually be vegan.</p>

<p>'It really unsettles me that the owner of Smith &amp; Daughters isn't vegan,' Tweeted one viewer, while another added: 'A vegan chef that isn't vegan? What is she doing with her life?  </p>
