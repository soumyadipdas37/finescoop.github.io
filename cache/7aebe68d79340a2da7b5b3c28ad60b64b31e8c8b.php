<p>Abigail Brady's two-year-old son, Theo, insists on bringing his skeleton, Benny, in the car to run errands or to play at the park.</p>

<p>In an interview with Today, Brady, 27, said: '2020 has been probably one of the craziest years in a while and I know it has brought a lot of people a lot of turmoil and a lot of hardship.</p>

<p>'My hope is that this can just spread some happiness. Even if it makes someone’s day for a couple of minutes, that makes me so happy.'</p>

<p>Two-year-old Theo has found friendship in the form of his new favorite toy: a five-foot-tall Halloween skeleton</p>

<p>Brady has shared several photos and videos of her son on her Instagram account hanging out with Benny. </p>

<p>Some of those show Theo riding in a cart at a grocery store with Benny as well as playing at a local park.</p>

<p>According to Brady, the friendship began on September 15 when she noticed her basement had flooded and began to bring items upstairs. </p>

<p>While she was bringing the boxes upstairs she heard Theo yelling: 'Mom, mom, help, help, help.'</p>

<p>When she went to check on him, she found Theo trying to pull the skeleton up the stairs. </p>

<p>'I was like, "Oh my gosh that is so funny." So I brought it upstairs,” Brady told Today. </p>

<p>From there, Brady refused to go any where without the decoration and Brady has been sharing that journey on social media ever since. </p>

<p>Recently, Brady received a skeleton dog from Home Depot as a gift for Theo. In another video, Theo gets super excited about having a skeleton pet for his bony pal.  </p>
