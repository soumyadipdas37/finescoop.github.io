<p>The 44-year-old's pedigree Bengal cat Leo had been missing for eight months when a neighbour brought over a mog they thought might belong to Will.     </p>

<p>The star said he genuinely thought the cat was his, and when the vet said the it had throat cancer he agreed to have it put down. </p>

<p>Unbelievable: Ex-Hollyoaks actor Will Mellor has revealed he accidentally put down someone else's cat thinking it was his own</p>

<p>He then displayed the cat's ashes in an urn for weeks - before his own cat one day finally turned up after being run over.   </p>

<p>Speaking on the Two Pints With Will and Ralf podcast, he revealed: 'I get a knock on the door — 'We've got your cat'. It was haggard. He had something wrong with his throat.</p>

<p>'So I took him to the vet, and they said, 'He's got throat cancer, got it really bad, we advise you put him down'.</p>

<p>'I thought, my daughter's going to be upset. So I brought him home, let them have one more day with the cat, taking pictures with him, saying goodbye to him.</p>

<p>Oh no! Will's cat Leo is a Bengal pedigree (stock photo) </p>

<p>Comical: Will was speaking on his Two Pints With Will and Ralf podcast</p>

<p>'On the day, I was so upset they put me in the relatives' room. It was terrible, I was so emotional. After, we buy a cheap urn for the ashes and put it on the side.</p>

<p>'Anyway, a month goes by and then the buzzer goes — 'We've got your cat, it's been run over'. It was someone else's cat. I've put down someone else's cat!</p>

<p>'So I'm like, 'Who the f**k's on my windowsill then? I've got the ashes of someone's cat on there, and they don't know where the cat is, and I've just killed it.'</p>

<p>A saga: Will said he was 'so upset' after they put down the first cat, storing his ashes on the window sill for weeks</p>

<p>While the family was happy that the real Leo had returned, Will had to take him to the vet to have his hip dealt with following his car accident. </p>

<p>He said: '£5,000 in vet bills later… Do you know how much it is for a f***ing drip on a cat overnight? A saline drip? It's a fortune.'</p>

<p>In a cruel twist of fate, Will confided that Leo has once again run away: 'Window left open, the f<strong>ker f</strong>ks off and he's not been back since.</p>

<p>'I couldn't believe it. I was fuming. He's gone. He's cost me a fortune and he's just p****d off as soon as he was fit enough.'</p>

<p>Twist of fate: Will confided that Leo has since in fact run away again</p>
