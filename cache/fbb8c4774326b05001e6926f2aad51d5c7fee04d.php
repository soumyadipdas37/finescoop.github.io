<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The British head of global HR at McDonald's was sacked for making women at the firm 'feel uncomfortable', it is alleged.</p>

<p>David Fairhurst, who was promoted to McDonald's 'chief people officer' in 2015 by fellow Brit Steve Easterbrook, was suddenly sacked last year after Easterbrook was also dismissed for having a relationship with at least one employee.</p>

<p>At the time no reason was given for Fairhurst's dismissal and his family claimed he had been made a 'scape-goat' for his boss, but allegations have now emerged that the Wigan-born executive was also the subject of complaints from members of staff.</p>

<p>David Fairhurst, McDonald's head of HR until he was fired for unknown reasons last year, has been accused by an internal investigation of making women at the company 'uncomfortable'</p>

<p>Heidi Capozzi, the new head of McDonald's HR, told staff during a meeting last week that Fairhurst was fired for 'making women at the company feel uncomfortable on numerous occasions at business events', the Wall Street Journal reported.</p>

<p>Sources separately told the paper that Fairhurst had contributed to a 'party culture' under Easterbrook's tenure.</p>

<p>Fairhurst was sacked after the company received a complaint about his behavior around women at the company, the paper reported, without saying exactly what the complaint was.</p>

<p>The HR boss did not respond to requests for comment from the Wall Street Journal.</p>

<p>At the time of his departure last year, he posted a message on LinkedIn saying that he was 'moving on to my next career challenge', without elaborating.</p>

<p>Fairhurst was promoted to HR boss by Steve Easterbrook, McDonald's CEO until he was sacked over relationships with staff (pictured with a PR executive he had an affair with)</p>

<p>Fairhurst is now thought to be at the center of a McDonald's investigation into Easterbrook's tenure as company CEO. </p>

<p>Members of staff said they felt complaints to the HR department were ignored, while others feared retaliation if they complained to the firm's executives, WSJ reported.</p>

<p>'The board will follow the facts wherever they may lead,' McDonald's said in a statement to DailyMail.com.</p>

<p>Easterbrook rose to the very top of the McDonald's management structure in 2015, having worked his way up from a store manager job he took back in 1993.</p>

<p>Shortly after being flown to company HQ in Chicago to start his new job, he promoted Fairhurst - who he had previously worked with in the UK - to head of HR.</p>

<p>The two ran the company until November last year, when Easterbrook was sacked after having a consensual relationship with a female employee.</p>

<p>McDonald's company policy forbids any relationships between managers and either direct or indirect subordinates.</p>

<p>Despite being fired, Easterbrook was allowed to keep hold of $40million in bonuses and stock after telling McDonald's that no other relationships had taken place.</p>

<p>But McDonald's is now suing their former CEO, saying an internal investigation has uncovered relationships with at least three more employees.</p>

<p>The company says a tip-off led them to servers where nude and partially nude images and videos of members of staff were being stored.</p>

<p>The files had originally been sent to Easterbrook's work phone and email account, but had been deleted. They were archived on the server without his knowledge.</p>

<p>McDonald's is now suing Easterbrook amid allegations had had affairs with up to four staff members, while also investigating the HR culture during his time at the head of the firm</p>

<p>McDonald's has accused Easterbrook of deleting the files in order to hide the relationships, and then of lying to investigators about them.</p>

<p>Easterbrook has since filed a motion against the company, saying it knew about the other relationships when negotiating his severance package.</p>

<p>McDonald's has asked the court to dismiss his motion. </p>

<p>It has also been revealed that Easterbrook had another relationship with a female PR representative who was recruited by McDonald's before becoming CEO.</p>

<p>He is thought to have dated Denise Paleothodoros for two years until the relationship came to light in 2015, the same year he was promoted to CEO.</p>

<p>McDonald's was aware of the relationship, but concluded it did not violate policy.</p>

<p>After the affair was revealed, Miss Paleothodoros's employers, Golin, moved her to another account.</p>

<p>Easterbrook was married to wife Susie and the couple have three children, though it is not clear when they separated.</p>

<p>At the time of his departure, Easterbrook sent an email to staff saying: 'Given the values of the company, I agree with the board that it is the time to move on.'  </p>
