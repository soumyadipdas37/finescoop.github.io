<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Wisconsin construction worker taking a morning stroll along a beach in search of a peace of mind got more than he bargained for yesterday when he found a brain wrapped in foil washed up on the shoreline.</p>

<p>Jimmy Senda, of Racine, was partaking in his daily walking ritual along the shore of Lake Michigan, near to Samuel Myers Park, on Tuesday when he made the horrifying discovery.</p>

<p>Senda, who’s a part-time artist, says he regularly combs beaches in the area in search of interesting items such as sea glass to incorporate into his sculptures.</p>

<p>And the 47-year-old was understandably intrigued when he spotted a package, wrapped in aluminium foil and fastened with a pink rubber band, close to the water's edge.</p>

<p>‘Curiosity got to me, so I popped it open and it looked like a chicken breast,’ Senda told FOX6. ‘It took a little bit for it to really [register] of what was going on; it was a brain.’</p>

<p>Senda said he was so dumbfounded by the discovery his own brain struggled to comprehend precisely what was unfolding</p>

<p>Jimmy Senda, of Racine, was partaking in his morning ritual along the shore of Lake Michigan, near to Samuel Myers Park, yesterday when he made the horrifying discovery</p>

<p>Also concealed in the bizarre package were two light-pink flower heads and what appeared to be Chinese currency, he said.</p>

<p>Senda said he was so dumbfounded by the discovery that his own brain struggled to comprehend precisely what was unfolding.</p>

<p>‘I don't really know how to explain it, it didn't register...I was just like, “What is this?”’ he continued.</p>

<p>The construction worker then consulted with some city workers nearby who concluded, ‘”Yeah, that’s a Brain,”’ as he recalled it.</p>

<p>Senda then called police who made the same determination. The officers then took the brain away from the scene to investigate further.</p>

<p>Cops have since said they don’t believe the brain is human, but are awaiting official confirmation from the Racine County Medical Examiner’s Office.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from the examiner's office told DailyMail.com: 'We definitely know it's an animal brain, we're just not certain what kind yet.' </p>

<p> Early signs in the investigation suggest it could be a cat brain, according to TMZ.</p>

<p>He found the brain wrapped in aluminum foil, secured by a rubber band, close to the water </p>

<p>Also concealed in the bizarre package were two light-pink flower heads and what appeared to be Chinese money, according to Senda</p>

<p>Senda, meanwhile, told FOX6 he normally walks the beaches further north and said it has been a while since he had been to Myers Park</p>

<p>While Examiner’s Office continues their probe, Semba’s disturbing discovery has been blowing minds on social media.</p>

<p>‘Just when you thought 2020 couldn’t get any more f***ed up,’ said one commenter on Senda’s original Facebook post, documenting what he found.</p>

<p>‘Is there a cannibal running around,’ added another.</p>

<p>While many voiced fears the brain was human, others voiced scepticism from the beginning that it appeared to be a pig brain, or another animal, due to the scale of the encephalon compared to his hands.</p>

<p>‘Why won’t you say what the police said,’ one user scoffed. ‘It’s obviously not a FULL GROWN human brain.’</p>

<p>Multiple other disturbed viewers theorized the brain may have been used in some form of sacrificial worship.  </p>

<p>Senda, meanwhile, told FOX6 he normally walks the beaches further north and said it has been a while since he had been to Myers Park.</p>

<p>He said that on some level he’s glad it was him who made the discovery.</p>

<p>‘There’s a lot of kids and families that are down here, and what happens if a kid would have found it?’ he said.</p>
