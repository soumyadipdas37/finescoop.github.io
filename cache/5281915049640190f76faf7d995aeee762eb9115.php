<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A virtual reality simulation system costing £300,000 is being trialled by the Royal Air Force (RAF) in an effort to make combat training more immersive and realistic.</p>

<p>The 'first-person shooter' -style combat game is being developed under contract with the UK Ministry of Defence by the veteran-run software company SimCentric.</p>

<p>The simulation software — dubbed 'SAF-TAC' — is built on top of Epic Games' Unreal Engine 4, which also powers the popular video games Fortnite and Borderlands 3.  </p>

<p>SAF-TAC features bespoke training scenarios, high-definition surround sound, high-fidelity graphics, haptic feedback and intuitive gesture-based controls. </p>

<p>SAF-TAC will also be put through tests this year with members of the British Army and the Royal Marines, alongside the air force.</p>

<p>It is intended that the virtual simulator will become a routine part of the armed forces' wider training programme to support and enhance real-life exercises. </p>

<p>A virtual reality simulation system costing £300,000, pictured, is being trialled by the Royal Air Force in an effort to help make combat training be more immersive and realistic</p>

<p>The 'first-person shooter' -style combat game, pictured, is being developed under contract with the RAF by the veteran-run software company SimCentric</p>

<p>'As a veteran and current reservist, I’m proud to help train the armed forces of the future,' said SimCentric's director of innovation, Tom Constable, formerly of the British Army air corps. </p>

<p>'I joined the British Army in 2006 and later served in Afghanistan,' he explained.</p>

<p>'This gave me a passion for building technology that will reduce the risk to our armed forces and improve the quality of training.'</p>

<p>SimCentric's work, he added, has 'the ultimate aim of saving lives.'</p>

<p>According to the RAF, it is 'crucial' that they keep up with the acceleration in technological developments — both to understand their current capabilities, but also to make such fit their evolving training needs.</p>

<p>SimCentric's combat simulator has already been trialled by the air force's Training Wing, which is based out of RAF Honington in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.</p>

<p>Sargent R.E. Minshall of Training Wing's Training Support Squadron said that the trial of the combat simulator had 'allowed [him] to gain further understanding of how we can incorporate VR into training.'</p>

<p>'With the given opportunity to have input from the instructors on the trial, it will make for a system that is fit for our needs.'</p>

<p>'I am looking forward to seeing this become incorporated into out training in the future.'</p>

<p>'I can see its many of benefits being used to enhance the training that Training Wing provides to all phases.'</p>

<p>The tests of the SAF-TAC combat simulator come amid a wider push by the British Armed Forces towards virtual war gaming.</p>

<p>According to the Financial Times, defence chiefs have tasked software firm Improbable to create a digital replica of Britain, with the aim of testing the country's resilience to future pandemics, natural disasters and attacks from hostile nations. </p>

<p>'This would have been really useful in understanding the spread of the pandemic, [...] of measures taken to inhibit it and improving public communications,' said former head of Britain’s joint forces command, Richard Barrons.</p>

<p>'We still need one for whatever [crisis] happens next.'</p>

<p>The 'single synthetic environment' — which will marry maps of geographical terrain with those of critical infrastructure like fuel, power and water supplies  — will be used to simulate disaster scenarios with the aid of artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Future simulations could also include realistic reconstructions of overseas combat arenas — and, in fact, one of Improbable's prototypes is based on a Baltic country, the Financial Times reported.</p>

<p>They added that the Ministry of Defence has already invested £25 million in contract with the software development firm.</p>

<p>Virtual reality is a computer-generated simulation of an environment or situation. </p>

<p>Virtual reality is the term used to describe A three-dimensional, computer generated environment which can be explored and interacted with by a person. </p>

<p>That person becomes part of this virtual world or is immersed within this environment and whilst there, is able to manipulate objects or perform a series of actions.</p>

<p>How is virtual reality achieved? </p>

<p>Virtual reality is usually implemented using computer technology. There are a range of systems that are used for this purpose, such as headsets, omni-directional treadmills and special gloves. </p>

<p>These are used to actually stimulate our senses together in order to create the illusion of reality. </p>
