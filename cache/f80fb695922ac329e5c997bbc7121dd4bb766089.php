<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Profiles on a software billionaire, the boss of a mining conglomerate, an ex-military chief and even the prime minister have been compiled by a Chinese Communist Party contractor which boasts of waging 'hybrid warfare' for Beijing.</p>

<p>The database containing intelligence on some of Australia's most influential political and economic powers has been leaked from the files of Zhenhua Data based in Shenzhen in China's south-east.</p>

<p>The military contractor has been described as 'Cambridge Analytica on steroids' by one intelligence analyst. </p>

<p>A client of the Chinese government, the firm says its goal is to use big data - much of which has been 'scraped' from public online sources like Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn - to achieve 'the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation'.</p>

<p>Software billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes pictured with his wife Annie. He has been listed as a 'special interest' by a Chinese firm which has compiled the data of 35,000 Australian figures</p>

<p>Singer Natalie Imbruglia was also named by the company's 'Overseas Key Individuals Database'</p>

<p>Liberal MP Andrew Hastie pictured right. He has been mentioned along with members of his family by the Chinese database</p>

<p>The leak comes amid worsening political tensions between Australia and China and follows two Australian journalists fleeing the country last week.</p>

<p>Zhenhua's database covers 2.4million individuals worldwide, of which 10 per cent have been restored by a Canberra cyber security company, including more than 35,558 Australians - 656 of whom are called 'special interest' or 'politically exposed'.</p>

<p>Nine Entertainment CEO Hugh Marks is included on the list as well as Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the former commander of the Royal Australian Navy Raydon Gates.</p>

<p>Each of the 2.4 million figures globally who have been mentioned in the database have been given a numerical ranking to represent their influence in a certain country, The Australian Financial Review reported. </p>

<p>Gov van Ek - co-founder of energy trading company Power Ledger</p>

<p>Brandon Munro - chief executive of mining conglomerate Bannerman Resources </p>

<p>Scott Morrison - Australian prime minister </p>

<p>Natalie Imbruglia - singer</p>

<p>Raydon Gates - Ex-Royal Australian Navy commander</p>

<p>Jennifer Westacott - Business Council of Australia chief executive</p>

<p>Emma Husar - Ex-Labor MP</p>

<p>David Oldfield - One Nation co-founder</p>

<p>Anthony Cavanough - Victorian Supreme Court judge</p>

<p>Mike Cannon-Brookes - Atlassian co-founder </p>

<p>Geoff Raby - ex-ambassador to China</p>

<p>Andrew Hastie - Liberal MP </p>

<p>Information on the young family of Liberal MP Andrew Hastie - an ex-SAS soldier who is now the chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security - is also catalogued by Zhenhua Data.</p>

<p>Zhenhua's chief executive is a former employee of technology giant IBM and has said China's social media app WeChat should be used to conduct 'hybrid' and 'psychological warfare' and manipulate public opinion. </p>

<p>Former commander of the Royal Australian Navy Raydon Gates is featured in the leaked dossier from a company described as 'Cambridge Analytica on steroids'</p>

<p>Singer Natalie Imbruglia and Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brooks, who was ranked fifth in Forbes' list of Australia's 50 richest people this year, were also named by the company's 'Overseas Key Individuals Database'.</p>

<p>The database was leaked to US academic Professor Chris Balding who was employed by China's Peking University until 2018 before leaving the country in fear of his safety.</p>

<p>'China is absolutely building out a massive surveillance state both domestically and internationally,' Professor Balding told ABC News.</p>

<p>'They're using a wide variety of tools — this one is taken primarily from public sources, there is non-public data in here, but it is taken primarily from public sources.' </p>

<p>A high-powered chief executive of uranium developer Bannerman Resources Brandon Munro, which has also been listed by Zhenhua, said he was not surprised he was considered a person of interest by China.</p>

<p>'Given the geopolitical importance of uranium supply and the scale of Bannerman's Etango project [in Namibia], I am not surprised to be of interest to various governments,' he said.  </p>

<p>Australian journalist Cheng Lei (pictured) was detained in China's capital city Beijing in August. She is a high profile anchor for CGTN, China's English language state broadcaster</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Zhenhua for comment.</p>

<p>Last week, the Chinese government revealed why Cheng Lei, a high profile business anchor on Chinese state television, had been held in a secret location for more than three weeks. </p>

<p>'The Australian national Cheng Lei is suspected of carrying out criminal activities endangering China's national security,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.</p>

<p>'Compulsory measures have been imposed on Cheng and she has recently been investigated by relevant authorities.'</p>

<p>He said the case was being handled according to Chinese law and Ms Cheng's legitimate rights and interests were fully guaranteed.</p>

<p>Two Australian journalists were rushed out of China for their own safety last week after being banned from leaving until they answered questions about Ms Cheng.</p>

<p>Bill Birtles from the ABC and Michael Smith from the Australian Financial Review returned to Sydney on Tuesday after a five-day diplomatic stand-off.</p>

<p>The explanation for Ms Cheng's arrest comes after two Australian reporters, Bill Birtles (pictured) from the ABC and Michael Smith from the AFR, fled China fearing for their safety </p>

<p>Their rushed evacuation has left Australia without any correspondents working on the ground in China for the first time in 50 years.</p>

<p>Chinese police told the journalists they were people of interest in the case of Ms Cheng and both men were ordered to report for questioning.</p>

<p>They sheltered in Australian diplomatic compounds for days as their travel rights were revoked.</p>

<p>Consular officials secured safe passage after the pair agreed to be interviewed.</p>

<p>Both journalists say they are relieved to be home but disappointed about the circumstances surrounding their departure. </p>

<p>Mr Birtles and Mr Smith (pictured) were initially banned from leaving the country until they answered questions about Cheng. Both reporters had been told they were persons of interest </p>
