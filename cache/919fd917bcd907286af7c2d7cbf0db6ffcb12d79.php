<p>Recap the action as it unfolded below. </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>That's all for our coverage of Barcelona's win against Villarreal. Thank you for following the game with us. </p>

<p>Barcelona's overall performance was very impressive and Koeman's 4-2-3-1 system worked well.</p>

<p>Villarreal, meanwhile, struggled and there is much work for Unai Emery to do. </p>

<p>The game is over, and it's a winning start for Koeman. Fati scored a brace, Messi netted a penalty and Pau Torres turned the ball into his own net. </p>

<p>90 mins - Messi is still looking for another goal and sends a free-kick over. </p>

<p>89 mins - Kubo is continuing to threaten and forces Neto to make a save</p>

<p>86 mins - Messi has another effort tipped over. Pjanic has done well since being brought on, while Kubo has impressed for Villarreal. </p>

<p>Gerard Moreno goes into the book for Villarreal for a clash with Pique. </p>

<p>Funes Mori comes on for Albiol. Bacca is on for Moreno.</p>

<p>81 mins - Villarreal, to their credit, haven't been disheartened and have continued to push forward with regularity. Gaspar's effort goes over. </p>

<p>Two debutants for Barcelona as Trincao and Pjanic enter the fray. Griezmann and Busquets are the players to make way </p>

<p>73 mins: A rare moment of alarm for Barcelona as De Jong loses the ball, but Clement Lenglet is there to clear the danger. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kubo, on loan from Real Madrid, replaces Chukwueze for Villarreal. </p>

<p>71 mins: Alba gets forward well again and picks out Messi, but the Argentina star's header is off target. </p>

<p>It was a very good performance from Coutinho, who could prove to be a crucial player for Koeman this season.</p>

<p>Those Barcelona changes are made, with Dembele and Pedri replacing Fati and Coutinho. </p>

<p>65 mins: Messi's effort is tipped over the crossbar. It looks like Dembele and Pedri are about to come on. </p>

<p>62 mins - Frenkie de Jong is pushing forward to good effect at times. It certainly wouldn't be a surprise if Barcelona were to add to their lead.</p>

<p>56 mins - Barcelona are determined to add to their considerable lead, and Griezmann goes for goal, but his effort is blocked. </p>

<p>53 mins - Villarreal have looked a little more threatening since Emery's changes, but Barcelona's defence are coping well so far</p>

<p>51 mins - It has been a very quiet night for Neto so far, but the Barcelona goalkeeper is alert on this occasion to rush off his line and clear the danger. </p>

<p>48 mins - Barcelona are continuing to push forward with regularity. Ansu Fati is still at the heart of proceedings and plays a lofted pass into the path of Messi, who sees his shot saved.</p>

<p>The second half is underway at the Nou Camp, with Emery making a couple of changes for Villarreal. Trigueros and Iborra are on for Coquelin and Alcacer. </p>

<p>It has been a hugely impressive first half for Koeman's side, with Fait netting a brace, Messi scoring a penalty and Pau Torres' own goal adding to the scoreline.   </p>

<p>Messi plays a wonderful ball into the box and Villarreal defender Pau Torres inadvertently turns it into his own net. </p>

<p>Barcelona are starting to work the ball very well and one intricate move concludes with Coutinho trying his luck and his effort being tipped over by Asenjo.</p>

<p>Alcacer thought he had a chance to score but Neto claimed it and the flag was up anyway</p>

<p>Messi steps up to convert the penalty, despite Asenjo diving the right way. </p>

<p>Fati wins a penalty as he's brought down by Mario Gaspar.</p>

<p>Francis Coquelin, who joined Villarreal from Valencia, doesn't look sharp at all and has been struggling physically in the opening weeks of the campaign. </p>

<p>Estupinan pushes forward for Villarreal but his effort lacked conviction. They've struggled to supply Gerard Moreno</p>

<p>25 mins: Barcelona are utterly dominant at the moment. Alba is getting forward with ease, and the left-back sees his shot saved.</p>

<p>Fati's quality was already clear last season but this could be a hugely productive campaign for the 17-year-old. It appears that Ronald Koeman has a lot of faith in the winger, who will be looking to progress even further. </p>

<p>It's another goal for Fati, with Coutinho finding the talented young winger. Villarreal's defending was disappointing but it's still a well-worked goal.</p>

<p>Barcelona get the first goal of the Ronald Koeman era. Jordi Alba finds Ansu Fati, who finishes excellently to open the scoring. </p>

<p>Villarreal have kept their shape well so far and have looked rather composed despite Barcelona's quality. </p>

<p>Barcelona are starting to get into the game. Alba won a corner, with Coutinho subsequently seeing a shot deflected away</p>

<p>At the moment Griezmann is on the right wing with Messi up front</p>

<p>The game is underway at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>While Barcelona are attempting to restore their reputation, the same applies to Unai Emery.</p>

<p>His spell at Arsenal certainly didn't go to plan, but, back in Spain, he will hope that he will be able to make a major impact at Villarreal. </p>

<p>The conclusion to last season was hugely frustrating for Barcelona as they ended the campaign without a trophy and were thrashed 8-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League.</p>

<p>Koeman faces a tough task in attempting to improve Barcelona's fortunes. Coutinho's return, though, could be a major boost. </p>

<p>While Barcelona are playing their first league game of the season, this is Villarreal's third fixture. They have four points so far.</p>

<p>Unai Emery can call upon the likes of Gerard Moreno and Paco Alcacer. </p>

<p>Villarreal: Asenjo; Gaspar, Albiol, Torres, Estupinan; Chukwueze, Parejo, Coquelin, Gomez; Moreno, Alcacer.</p>

<p>Subs: Bacca, Baena, Trigueros, Funes Mori, Rulli, Cabrera, Jaume Costa, Kubo, Iborra</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman has named his first official starting lineup as Barcelona manager.</p>

<p>Philippe Coutinho, back from his loan spell at Bayern Munich, is involved from the outset, as is Ansu Fati, who has been officially promoted to the first-team squad.</p>

<p>Lionel Messi, of course, also starts after he ended up staying at the club.</p>

<p>Neto is in goal, with Marc-Andre Ter Stegen out injured. </p>

<p>Barcelona: Neto; Roberto, Pique, Lenglet, Alba; Busquets, De Jong; Messi, Coutinho, Fati; Griezmann</p>

<p>Subs: Pena, Rafinha, Araujo, Dembele, Pjanic, Tenas, Ramos, Firpo, Puig, Alena, Trincao, Pedri. </p>
