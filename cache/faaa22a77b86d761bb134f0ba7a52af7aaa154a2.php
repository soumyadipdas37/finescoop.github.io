<p>Laurence Fox is launching a new political party to fight the culture wars and has already raised more than £1million</p>

<p>The actor, 42, has received substantial sums from former Tory donors and hopes to stand dozens of candidates across the UK</p>

<p>Among his aims are reforming the BBC and celebrating Britain's contribution to the world, according to The Telegraph.</p>

<p>The new party is provisionally called Reclaim and has a website named LaurenceFoxParty.</p>

<p>He hopes to launch the party next month and the name is subject to the Electoral Commission's approval.</p>

<p>His website states: 'Over many years it has become clear that our politicians have lost touch with the people they represent and govern. Moreover, our public institutions now work to an agenda beyond their main purpose.</p>

<p>Among his aims are reforming the BBC, protecting free speech and celebrating Britain's contribution to the world</p>

<p>Among the early proponents of the new party are Toby Young who said Fox's contribution to politics was 'exciting news'</p>

<p>'Our modern United Kingdom was born out of the respectful inclusion of so many individual voices. It is steeped in the innate values of families and communities, diverse in the truest sense but united in the want and need to call this island home.</p>

<p>'The people of the United Kingdom are tired of being told that we represent the very thing we have, in history, stood together against.</p>

<p>'We are all privileged to be the custodians of our shared heritage. We can reclaim a respectful nation where all are included and none are ashamed to have somewhere to call home.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I have been so encouraged by the support I have received by those wishing to add their voices to this reclamation of our values.</p>

<p>'Our country is now in desperate need of a new political movement which promises to make our future a shared endeavour, not a divisive one. This is now my endeavour.'</p>

<p>Many on social media are divided over the news, with some celebrating an alternative to the current options in politics, while others derided Fox and his views</p>

<p>A Westminster source said the new party is a version of UKIP for the culture wars and believes it could attract hundreds of thousands of unhappy Conservative voters.</p>

<p>Sources close to Fox said the party does not see itself as strictly left or right wing but will be a broad church.</p>

<p>Reclaim so far has three objectives, which include protecting free speech, reforming publicly funded institutions, and preserving and celebrating Britain's cultural history.</p>

<p>Planning has been underway for the last two months and backers include former Tory donor Jeremy Hosking.</p>

<p>Staff are already being recruited for the party after Fox was launched into the political arena after his performance on Question Time in January.</p>
