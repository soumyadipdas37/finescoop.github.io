<p>Figures from the Association of Dogs and Cats Homes revealed that felines were twice as likely to be abandoned than their canine companions.</p>

<p>A survey of more than 130 animal-rescue homes in April found that 17 per cent reported more cats were being abandoned during lockdown - compared to eight per cent more dogs.</p>

<p>The trend in unwanted pets could be due to fears that owners could contract Covid from their beloved creatures, despite the fact that there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus.</p>

<p>It could also be related to financial worries which may lead owners to ditch their pets.</p>

<p>This comes as the Dogs Trust warned in August that up to 40,000 more stray or abandoned dogs could be in need of help if an economic recession lies ahead.</p>

<p>More results from the survey from the Association of Dogs and Cats Homes showed that some animal-rescue homes reported fewer animals being abandoned than before the 'stay at home' lockdown. </p>

<p>Even so, 15 per cent of rescue homes were reporting fewer dogs being abandoned than usual, but only seven per cent reporting fewer cats being dumped.  </p>

<p>However, there is hope these unwanted pets will soon find a new home. Animal-rescue homes reported a 35% increase in people wanting to re-home a cat or dog. </p>

<p>David Bowles, a trustee of Association of Dogs and Cats Homes, speaking to The Telegraph said: 'We saw more cats being abandoned in May, June and July than we did in April. </p>

<p>He added: 'Under lockdown people wanted to have a companion and they saw dogs as a good companion. </p>

<p>'And in early lockdown we were only allowed out once a day for exercise – and dogs provided a very good excuse for exercise.'</p>

<p>Pet shops and vets can stay open during the pandemic as they are deemed 'essential retailers'.  </p>
