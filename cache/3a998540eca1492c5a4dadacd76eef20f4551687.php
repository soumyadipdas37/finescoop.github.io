<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Prime Minister David Cameron wants to add an outdoor swimming pool to his £1.5million family home in the Cotswolds. </p>

<p>The 53-year-old has applied for planning permission for the 14x4 metre outdoor pool, which plans suggest would be heated.   </p>

<p>If approved, it would be the latest luxury addition to the ex-PM's Cotswold home. </p>

<p>He caused a stir in 2017 when he installed a shepherd's hut in the garden - a plush upgrade on a garden shed.   </p>

<p>Former PM David Cameron has submitted plans to the council to build an outdoor swimming pool at his home, where he installed a luxury shepherd's hut in 2017 (pictured)</p>

<p>Plans submitted to West Oxfordshire District Council suggest he hopes to heat the outdoor pool if it is installed at his £1.5million Cotswold's bolthole</p>

<p>With sheep's-wool insulation and mod cons including dimmer light and classic Bakelite switches, the hand-crafted outbuilding has pride of place in the back garden of Mr Cameron's Oxfordshire home.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron has a wood-burning stove in the hut, which would make it a great place to warm up after a dip in the outdoor pool.</p>

<p>West Oxfordshire District Council has not yet approved the plans, The Sun reports.</p>

<p>Flood risk officials are said to want more details on how the pool will be drained before the plans can progress.  </p>

<p>The shepherd's hut Mr Cameron has in his garden is on black metal wheels, so could be moved alongside the pool to act as a pool house if plans to build it are approved.</p>

<p>He is so fond of his £25,000 luxury bolthole he installed a second one in his family's holiday home in Cornwall after the first one sparked a family fall out.  </p>

<p>The rural home in Oxfordshire is where the former PM hunkered down to write his memoirs, which were published in September last year</p>

<p>The Council has not yet approved the plans for the heated outdoor pool at their family bolthole, as flood officials need more details on how it will drain</p>

<p>He said back in 2017: 'There's been a bit of a fight already – my children want to use it as a wendy house. </p>

<p>'I want to use it as a book-writing room and my son wants it as an alternative bedroom.' </p>

<p>The posh shed is where Mr Cameron hunkererd down to write his memoirs, For The Record, which were published in September last year.   </p>

<p>The huts are made by Paul Bennett of Red Sky Shepherd's Huts.</p>

<p>Prices start from £20,000 and rise to £25,000 before optional extras such as stoves, kitchenettes, bathrooms and French doors are added.  </p>
