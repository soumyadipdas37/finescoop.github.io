<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Performing random acts of kindness can improve your wellbeing more than any pre-planned act of generosity or time spent volunteering, a new study revealed. </p>

<p>Researchers from the University of Hong Kong analysed the results of more than 200 previous studies into generosity involving over 198,000 participants.</p>

<p>There is a modest link between doing good and mental and physical wellbeing, but not all studies confirmed the link and some found there were caveats. </p>

<p>They found that overall unplanned actions such as helping a neighbour with their shopping was more beneficial than a regular volunteering activity. </p>

<p>This may be because informal helping is more casual and spontaneous and may more easily lead to forming social connections, study authors explained.</p>

<p>To better understand the link between doing good and wellbeing, Dr Hui and colleagues analysed the findings of previous studies - finding not all found a link. </p>

<p>Lead author Dr Bryant Hui said altruism, cooperation, trust and compassion are all necessary ingredients of a harmonious and well-functioning society. </p>

<p>'It is part of the shared culture of humankind, and our analysis shows that it also contributes to mental and physical health.' </p>

<p>To better understand what led to some studies finding a link and others not finding a link, Dr Hui and his colleagues looked at studies that examined that connection. </p>

<p>Overall, they found there was a 'modest' link between doing good and wellbeing.</p>

<p>But Dr Hui said that although the effect size was small, it was still 'meaningful' given how many people perform acts of kindness every day.' </p>

<p>'A modest effect size can still have a significant impact at a societal level when many people are participating in the behaviour,' Hui explained.</p>

<p>Dr Hui found that random acts of kindness were more strongly associated with overall wellbeing than formal behaviour, such as scheduled volunteering.</p>

<p>He said that 'informal giving' is also more varied and less likely to become stale or monotonous than 'formal giving'.</p>

<p>The researchers also found a stronger link between kindness and what is known as 'eudaimonic wellbeing'.</p>

<p>This focuses on self-actualisation, realising one's potential and finding meaning in life - than between kindness and 'hedonic well-being' which refers to happiness and positive feelings.</p>

<p>Dr Hui, who began the research while at Cambridge University, noted that the effects also varied by age.</p>

<p>They found that overall unplanned actions such as helping a neighbour with their shopping was more beneficial than a regular volunteering activity. Stock imagee</p>

<p>Younger givers reported higher levels of overall wellbeing, eudaimonic wellbeing, and psychological functioning.</p>

<p>However, older givers reported higher levels of physical health, Hui explained.</p>

<p>Women showed stronger relationships between prosociality and several measures of wellbeing compared with men, according to the findings.</p>

<p>Dr Hui said that may be because women are stereotypically expected to be more caring and giving, and so derive a stronger sense of good feelings for acting in accordance with those social norms.</p>

<p>He said future research might also examine whether more prosociality is always a good thing, or whether there is an 'ideal level' of prosociality beyond which too much kindness and giving become detrimental to the giver.</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Psychological Bulletin. </p>

<p>Being generous really does make people happier, according to research from an international team of experts.</p>

<p>Neurons in an area of the brain associated with generosity activate neurons in the ventral striatum, which are associated with happiness, the study found.</p>

<p>A group of 50 volunteers in Switzerland took part in a spending experiment, with each given 25 Swiss Francs (£20/$25) per week for four weeks. </p>

<p>As part of the experiment, participants performed an independent decision-making task, in which they could behave more or less generously while brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).</p>

<p>They were asked to choose to give between three and 25 francs of their money as a present to a recipient different from those previously chosen.</p>

<p>The researchers found that participants who had committed to spending their endowment on others behaved more generously in the decision-making task.</p>

<p>They also discovered greater self-reported increases in happiness as compared to the control group. </p>

<p>The full results were published in the journal Nature Communications.</p>
