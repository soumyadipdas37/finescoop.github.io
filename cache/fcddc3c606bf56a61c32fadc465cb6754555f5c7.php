<p>A Romanian serial sex attacker who raped a woman just a week after entering the UK has been jailed for nearly eight years.</p>

<p>Mihai Roban, 47, attacked the 28-year-old behind a public toilet on Regents Park Road in north London at around 2.40am on January 20 this year.</p>

<p>The terrified woman had been walking home from a bar in Finchley when she was accosted by the rapist and dragged behind the loos.</p>

<p>She begged Roban, who has two convictions for rape in his home country, to stop, but the depraved sex criminal continued his brutal attack.</p>

<p>Police were called to the scene after a member of the public heard the victim's screams through the night air, Harrow Crown Court heard.</p>

<p>Roban was still with his victim when he was arrested, the court heard. He was taken into custody where he refused to make any comment about the incident during an interview with officers. </p>

<p>The Romanian was charged with rape the same day by Public Protection Detectives from the North West Command Unit. The triple rapist finally admitted the offence a week before he was due to stand trial in July.</p>

<p>Scotland Yard said he had arrived in the UK a week before carrying out the attack.</p>

<p>Today Roban, of no fixed address, was jailed for seven years and eight months. He is also required to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life.</p>

<p>Mihai Roban, 47, raped the 28-year-old woman behind a public toilet on Regents Park Road in north London at around 2.40am on January 20 this year</p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Michael Daly, from the Metropolitan Police, said: 'Roban had only been in the country for a week when he carried out this attack.</p>

<p>'When we conducted inquiries with police in his home country of Romania we discovered that he had two previous convictions for rape and prison is the right place for him.</p>

<p>'He maintained his innocence until the week before the trial was due to start which brought further anguish to his victim.</p>

<p>'The victim has been incredibly strong throughout the investigation and I hope that knowing Roban will be in prison for some time will help her to move on from her horrible ordeal.</p>

<p>'I also wish to thank the member of the public for doing the right thing and calling the police when they heard the victim's calls for help, as well as the investigation team for their excellent work and their continued dedication supporting victims of rape and bringing the offenders to justice.'</p>
