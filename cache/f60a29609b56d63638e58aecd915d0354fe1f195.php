<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David De Gea has brushed aside fears over his confidence, insisting he is in top shape and ready to fight Dean Henderson for his starting place.  </p>

<p>The Manchester United keeper's shocker in 2019-20 featuring costly howlers against Tottenham and Chelsea have put the man formerly known as the world's best keeper in jeopardy of losing his place. </p>

<p>The Spaniard started Unite'd opening day 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last weekend but more slip-ups could see 23-year-old Henderson steal his spot, having returned from an impressive Sheffield United loan.  </p>

<p>David De Gea is determined to keep his starting spot as Manchester United's No.1 this season </p>

<p>The Spaniard's dreadful 2019-20 has seen him come under pressure from Dean Henderson </p>

<p>De Gea kept his placed for United'd dour 3-1 defeat on the opening day the Premier League </p>

<p>'I feel very, very well and very confident and very positive and that's very important for me,' the Spaniard told manutd.com.  </p>

<p>'Now it's time to be back to winning ways and winning trophies, that's the most important thing for us at the moment. Like I say I feel very, very good.</p>

<p>'It's great to train every day here with the coaches and the goalkeepers. </p>

<p>'We always try to learn from each other and try to push altogether. It's great. If you see the training it's really good to see the goalkeepers together.</p>

<p>Henderson's time on-loan at Sheffield United showed the keeper's quality at just 23-years-old</p>

<p>'It's very important to have good feelings with the other goalkeepers and the goalkeeping coaches as well. It's great. </p>

<p>'We are training, like I say, very, very well – the whole department of keepers. We need to be at this level every day and to show the players that the keepers are feeling 100%. Now like I said we have to go for trophies.'  </p>

<p>United's dreadful start to 2020-21 will need to be bettered at Brighton on Saturday, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side with Graham Potter's side having set off strongly.   </p>
