<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Phillip Schofield is reportedly planning an 'amicable' divorce from his wife Stephanie Lowe where he will share his £9million fortune.</p>

<p>The TV star, 58, - who came out as gay in February - apparently wants to avoid a bitter showdown like his friend Ant McPartlin, who divorced his wife of 12-years Lisa Armstrong earlier this year.</p>

<p>Unlike Ant and Lisa, Phil is believed to be against signing non-disclosure agreements and only expects his wife's 'ongoing loyalty' during the process.  </p>

<p>Fair and square: Phillip Schofield is reportedly planning an 'amicable' divorce from his wife Stephanie Lowe where he will share his £9million fortune</p>

<p>A source told the Sun: 'Phillip and Steph have had a lot of hard, painful conversations over the past ten months but remain as tight and devoted to one another as ever.  </p>

<p>Phil reportedly has no plans to move on with anyone else and is against a costly divorce battle - especially with his earnings at an 'all time high'.</p>

<p>The source added: 'Steph is entitled to half. He is not disputing this — all he wants in return is her ongoing loyalty . . . and discretion, his family is his No1 priority and that will never change.'</p>

<p>Last week it was reported that Phil's wealth has increased by £800,000 and as director of his company Fistral Productions, Steph will be entitled to some of it.</p>

<p>Together: Unlike Ant and Lisa, Phil - who came out as gay in February - is believed to be against signing non-disclosure agreements and only expects his wife's 'ongoing loyalty' during the process (pictured in 2020)</p>

<p>Plans: Phil reportedly has no plans to move on with anyone else and is against a costly divorce battle - especially with his earnings at an 'all time high' (pictured with their daughters Ruby and Molly)</p>

<p>He recently inked a £60,000 deal to become the face of a gin advent calendar and has long-running deals with Waitrose, We Buy Any Car and Princess Cruises.</p>

<p>Although they have reportedly discussed divorce, it doesn't seem like Phil is going far judging by apparent plans to convert a garage at his £2.6m family home into a two-bedroom bachelor pad.</p>

<p>He was thought to have moved out of his Oxfordshire mansion earlier this year, however he later suggested he'd spent lockdown at the spacious abode.</p>

<p>And now Phillip is said to be planning to make some changes to the house he shares with his wife Stephanie.</p>

<p>No thanks: The TV star, 58, apparently wants to avoid a bitter showdown like his friend Ant McPartlin (pictured), who divorced his wife of 12-years Lisa Armstrong earlier this year</p>

<p>Making changes? Phillip is reportedly set to convert a garage at the Oxfordshire house he shares with his wife Stephanie into a bachelor pad (pictured at their home in 2018)</p>

<p>Plans for the renovations seen by The Sun suggest that Phillip will knock down one of the house's garages to make space for his pad.</p>

<p>It is thought that there will be two-bedrooms in the new space as well as a large kitchen which will replace the former garage area.  </p>

<p>As for the more decorative details, there will reportedly be floor to ceiling windows to create a bright space and a large living room area to complete the home.    </p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'Phillip and Steph are getting on really well and are in no rush to make any big decisions.</p>

<p>Revelations: It was thought that the This Morning host (pictured with co-star Holly Willoughby) had moved out of the £2.6m mansion after revealing he was gay in February</p>

<p>'This annex can be used by any member of the family at any time — and is a great investment long-term, adding value to the property.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Phillip to ask for a comment at the time.</p>

<p>It had previously been thought that Phillip had moved out of the mansion he shared with his wife and two daughters and moved into a flat in London after coming out as gay earlier this year.</p>

<p>However he appeared to refute this in May, saying he had spent lockdown at the home after a fan questioned how he was able to visit his family during lockdown.  </p>

<p>Reports: It was believed that the TV presenter had moved out of the Oxfordshire house and into a flat in London after revealing that he is gay (pictured with his family during lockdown) </p>

<p>Questioning: After seeing the photograph on his Instagram page, one confused follower commented: 'So you moved out but you're allowed to visit your family?'</p>

<p>The confusion arose after Phillip posted some pictures of his family - wife Stephanie and daughters Ruby, 24, and Molly, 27 - enjoying a murder mystery evening together.</p>

<p>After seeing the photograph on his Instagram page, one follower commented: 'So you moved out but you're allowed to visit your family?  </p>

<p>'But I can't go and visit my children and grandchildren. Just the rich or famous that are allowed, good to know. [angry face emoji].'</p>

<p>In response, Phillip quizzed his critic on where they had heard that he had moved out of his family home, suggesting that he was still living there.</p>

<p>Phillip was pictured arriving at a flat in central London following his week-daily appearance on This Morning in April.</p>

<p>Ten weeks after coming out on national television, the presenter was pictured stepping out of a black car and into the pad, which is miles from the sprawling Oxfordshire property. </p>

<p>Phillip was reported to have amicably moved out of the £2m family home in Oxford after publicly coming out earlier this year. </p>

<p>While in May it was reported that staff at the ITV studios were made aware of the star's change of address, including the drivers who ferry him to and from the studio.</p>

<p>Glimpses: Phillip has previously shared snaps from inside the spacious home, revealing its cosy living area and decorative mirror</p>

<p>Comfy: Other pictures show a selection of cushions over a sofa and other stylish touches such as a floor lamp and plant</p>

<p>A source said: 'There has been talk for weeks that Phillip isn't living with Steph any more, that he had moved out for good and had a new home. He has a place in central London.</p>

<p>'It's not as big but it's the beginning of a new life for him. It very much also seems as though their marriage could well be over.' </p>

<p>However in February, when Phillip discussed his decision to come out on TV and Instagram, he insisted: 'We'll always be a family' and it's clear they remain close. </p>

<p>Announcement: Phillip surprised fans on February 7 by taking his place on the This Morning sofa besides co-host Holly Willoughby to reveal he is gay</p>

<p>He also insisted he still loves Steph as much as he did when they met 'if not more'. </p>

<p>During an emotional interview on This Morning with his co-host Holly, Phillip revealed that he has suffered 'inner conflict' and was ready to 'celebrate and be proud' of his sexuality, yet insisted he is not thinking about a new relationship. </p>

<p>Phillip said: 'Every person I tell it gets a little lighter and a little lighter, at the same time I have made this decision which is essential for me and essential for my head and that is principally the reason I have done this. They have been supporting while we get to this moment because we all know it was coming...</p>

<p>'Feeling lighter and lighter': Phillip announced he is gay in an impassioned post shared to Instagram before appearing on This Morning to discuss the news with his co-star Holly</p>

<p>'We've never had any secrets. It is tough but it's not something that has happened quickly, I have had to deal with this in my head for quite some time, we've gone through this together, we have been honest and have been open and Stephanie as I said, you know'.</p>

<p>Quick to lavish praise on his wife, he said: 'She's amazing, she's incredible, there's no one in my life who would have supported me. </p>

<p>A friend in need... Holly proved the depth of their friendship as she supported him during the announcement </p>

<p>Candid: Kicking off the subject on This Morning, Holly said: 'I think we all just take a breathe at that point, reading that I can hear your voice the pain how difficult it is for you, this is a big day, I know this is something you've been living with for a really long time'</p>

<p>'As a wife the way she's supported me, she's astonishing, literally astonishing, it's a good questions, you know this has been bothered me for a very long time...</p>

<p>He added: 'Steph has been incredible - I love her so very much. She is the kindest soul I have ever met. </p>

<p>'My girls have been astonishing in their love, hugs and encouraging words of comfort. Both mine and Steph's entire families have stunned me with their love, instant acceptance and support.' </p>
