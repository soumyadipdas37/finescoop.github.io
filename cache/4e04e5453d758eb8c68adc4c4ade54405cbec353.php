<p>The ancient workshop is thought to date back to the 18th Dynasty, during the reign of Amenhotep III – King Tut’s grandfather.</p>

<p>The Swedish-Egyptian team behind the discovery also found hundreds of hieroglyphic fragments at the site along with a small ‘practice piece’ of a sphinx that may have been carved by an apprentice.</p>

<p>Archaeologists have discovered the 3,000-year-old remains of an Egyptian carving workshop containing several unfinished sculptures, including a ram-headed sphinx chiseled from sandstone.</p>

<p>Amenhotep III inherited an empire that stretched from Euphrates to Sudan.</p>

<p>The 18th Dynasty ruler became king at age 12, with his mother as regent.</p>

<p>He is believed to have ruled Egypt between 1386 and 1349 BC.</p>

<p>He chose the daughter of a provincial official as his royal wife, and throughout his reign Queen Tiye featured alongside the king.</p>

<p>The king's palace at Malkata was close to his funerary temple - the largest ever built with its original location marked by the two 'Colossi of Memnon' statues.</p>

<p>Amenhotep III died in around 1354 BC and was succeeded by his son Amenhotep IV, known as Akhenaten.</p>

<p>Researchers with the Gebel el Silsila Project revealed their latest discovery in a blog post this week.</p>

<p>The team, led by archaeologists from Lund University and the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, says only the head of the ram-headed sphinx – known as a criosphinx – was visible before the excavations in the quarry.</p>

<p>Now, they’ve uncovered the full body of a sculpture that measures roughly 5-meters long and 3.5 meters tall.</p>

<p>The top half of its head, however, has broken off and appears to have been lost to time.</p>

<p>Beside the stomach of the large sculpture, the team uncovered yet another, smaller sphinx that appears to have been carved by an apprentice.</p>

<p>They also found a rough-cut sculpture of a coiled cobra that had been carved do crown the head of the main sphinx.</p>

<p>The ancient workshop is thought to date back to the 18th Dynasty, during the reign of Amenhotep III – King Tut’s grandfather. Researchers with the Gebel el Silsila Project revealed their latest discovery in a blog post this week</p>

<p>The finds included a fragment of a winged solar disk, shown above. The team also found a falcon sculpture and a quarry text written at the time the site first opened, during the ruler’s reign about 3350 years ago</p>

<p>‘Both sculptures are preserved in a rough-cut and prepared for transportation, but were likely abandoned at Gebel el-Silsila as the larger sculpture fractured,’ the researchers said.</p>

<p>‘Since then, later Roman quarry activity buried the sphinxes in spoil.’</p>

<p>According to the team, the trove of hieroglyphic fragments also found at the quarry came from a since-destroyed shrine to Amenhotep III.</p>

<p>The 18th Dynasty ruler reigned in the mid 1300s BC alongside Queen Tiye.</p>

<p>The team is now working to decipher the texts, which were written in red ochre.</p>

<p>Archaeologists will continue excavations and digital recordings at the site during the next dig season.</p>
