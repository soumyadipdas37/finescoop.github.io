<p>Leeds United are preparing for their first top-flight season in 16 years following promotion</p>

<p>Jamie O'Hara on Talksport said Leeds are getting 'overhyped' ahead of their first season back</p>

<p>On talkSport, former Leeds striker Jermaine Beckford and O’Hara were discussing where Leeds will finish this season with the former saying he fancies his side to finish inside the top-half.  </p>

<p>O'Hara replied: 'Top half? I'll start this off and I think they are getting way over-hyped. Way over-hyped with everything that's going on with Leeds right now.</p>

<p>'This is your first season back in the Premier League and I'm hearing people talking they are going to be top six. People are talking Champions League.</p>

<p>🤔 “They’re getting way over-hyped!”👀 “Get back in your box, Leeds United fans. You’re going to struggle.” ❌ “This isn’t the Championship.” Jamie O'Hara has a message for #LUFC fans, ahead of the new season. pic.twitter.com/fW02Z8PFoU</p>

<p>'Get back in your box Leeds United fans. You are going to struggle. It's going to be a long, hard, tough season.</p>

<p>'This is not the Championship. This is the pinnacle of football, the Premier League.</p>

<p>'Do not think you can just roll up and turn teams over every week. It ain't going to happen.'</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa's side are gearing up for their first-game back against champions Liverpool</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa's side are back in the Premier League after finishing top of the table in the Championship last season.</p>

<p>So far Leeds have been fairly busy in the transfer window including big money moves for striker Rodrigo from Valencia, Helder Costa from Wolves and defender Robin Koch from Freiburg.</p>
