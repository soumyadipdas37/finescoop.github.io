<p>The reality TV star revealed that the country legend, 74, insisted she needed to 'avoid temptation' for the time being to focus on her career as a West End star.</p>

<p>Amber has been single ever since she split from James Hawkins in 2018, after ending her romance with Love Island hunk Kem Cetinay.</p>

<p>She told The Sun she is so focused on work she doesn't have time to date and she has no plans to find a new man instead deciding to focus on her West End career.  </p>

<p>The star is set to appear in the stage version of Bring It On alongside Olympic gymnast Louis Smith once the coronavirus lockdown is lifted.  </p>

<p>She explained: 'It was actually Dolly Parton who first gave me the advice.</p>

<p>'I always thought I'd be ­settling down by now, but I went out to meet her and she warned me to avoid the temptation of romance for now and focus on my career.</p>

<p>'She said, ''Career first, men can wait for you'', and it turns out she was completely right.'</p>

<p>Amber met Dolly after playing the role of Judy in the West End adaptation of the 1980 film 9 To 5, which famously saw Dolly star and record the film's now-iconic theme song.</p>
