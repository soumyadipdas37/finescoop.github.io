<p>The blonde beauty was all smiles as she clutched the stunning bunch of fuchsia flowers, but it is unclear whether they were gifted by a secret admirer or simply a friend.  </p>

<p>Ashley has been single since ever since her split from Strictly Come Dancing professional, Giovanni Pernice.</p>

<p>The couple called time on their year-long romance in January after meeting during Ashley's stint on the BBC One dance competition in late 2018. </p>

<p>She reflected on her breakup from the Italian dancer, 29, in an interview with Fabulous magazine last month. She said: 'I'm good on my own, though. I'm pretty independent. </p>

<p>'It's nice to have that connection with someone, but at the moment lockdown is still [effectively] here, so "me" is where it is.'</p>

<p>She said about dating in lockdown: 'You can get to know someone a bit more before other "things" can happen… perhaps that's something that's positive. We'll see.'</p>
