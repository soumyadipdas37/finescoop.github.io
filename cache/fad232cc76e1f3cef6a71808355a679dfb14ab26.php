<p>WA Police Traffic posted an image of the woman's fine on their Twitter feed, drawing some hilarious responses in the comments.</p>

<p>'Better than carrying it I guess,' one response reads.</p>

<p>'Teaching it how to drive?' another said.</p>

<p>Road rules and penalties regarding animals in cars vary from state to state in Australia.</p>

<p>As a general rule in most states, an animal must be secured in the car and not in the driver's lap to avoid getting a fine.</p>

<p>Fines range between $100 and $560 depending on your state. </p>

<p>Under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, if an unrestrained animal is injured in a car accident, the driver can face six months in jail and a fine of $5,500.</p>

<p>The woman earned a $100 fine and lost one demerit point for driving with the goat on her lap</p>
