<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian lingerie designer and model Natalie Roser has blasted Kim Kardashian's shapewear brand Skims for being 'wasteful' in its new advertising campaign. </p>

<p>The campaign, which was shot by photographer Vanessa Beecroft, sees a unitard-clad Kim, 39, sitting on the floor surrounded by piles of shapewear in different skin-tones. </p>

<p>The floor and backdrop were also completely covered in the garments.  </p>

<p>'So much excess': Australian lingerie designer Natalie Roser, 30, (left) has slammed Kim Kardashian, 39, (right) for being 'wasteful' by using piles of shapewear as props for her new Skims campaign</p>

<p>Reposting an image from the campaign to her own Instagram account, Natalie, 30, wrote on Wednesday: 'So much excess. So many products to line the walls and floor of a studio. What happened to it after the shoot?' </p>

<p>'I watch Skims closely as it's a competitor for Rose &amp; Bare, but this campaign clearly sets us apart,' Natalie declared.  </p>

<p>'Rose &amp; Bare is not fast fashion. We strive for minimal waste, reusing as much as we can, even the fabric cut offs, we use to secure items in transport (and I use them as hair ties!)' she continued. </p>

<p>'This campaign clearly sets us apart': Reposting an image from the campaign to Instagram on Wednesday, Natalie pointed out what she believes is the difference between her brand Rose &amp; Bare and Skims</p>

<p>Continuing her comparison between the two brands, Natalie wrote: 'One year for Skims with a huge budget and reach and one year for Rose &amp; Bare as a self funded start up.' </p>

<p>'And I like to think that Rose &amp; Bare holds a more sustainable future as a brand with a soul,' she continued.</p>

<p>The blonde ended her rant with a more positive take on the situation, explaining that the popularity of Kim's brand means there is a future for skin colour-inclusive lingerie. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has reached out to Skims for comment. </p>

<p>Natalie launched her lingerie brand in May last year after noticing a gap in the Australian lingerie market. </p>

<p>'Australia is such a beautiful, multicultural country and I was surprised that so many underwear brands ignored the diversity of Australian women.' Natalie told POPSUGAR at the time. </p>

<p>'So I started working on Rose and Bare to solve that problem and provide a greater spectrum of 'nude' underwear,'' she said.  </p>
