<p>At the halfway point, the TOWIE star confided: 'I don't know if I can get through another half,' to which Tommy obliviously replied that he felt like he was 'glowing'.</p>

<p>Tommy gave numerous exercise tips to his fans, demonstrating how best to carry out an array of jabs and undercuts, press ups and squats. </p>

<p>The two reality hunks appeared on separate screens due to logistical reasons – despite the fact that both were in fact exercising at other ends of the same field.</p>

<p> Toned: Both Tommy and Mark sported tight-fitting grey exercise gear, that emphasised their enviable physiques</p>

<p>Amusingly at one point, Mark called across the field for Tommy to wave, and the myth of their separation was broken as it became clear they were just a few hundred metres away. </p>

<p>Despite Mark's visible tiredness, both he and Tommy appeared in good shape.</p>

<p>They each sported tight-fitting grey exercise gear that emphasised their enviable physiques. </p>

<p>When asked as to when he might next be in a boxing bout, Tommy said: 'I'm feeling in magnificent shape – and hopefully will have some fight news for you all soon.'  </p>

<p>Different abilities: While Tommy barely seemed to break a sweat, Mark appeared exhausted</p>

<p>He later added: 'I'm dedicating everything - I'm 21 years old, I'm living in camp, there's no partying, there's no drinking - I want to be a champ.'</p>

<p>For now though, he seemed pleased to help Mark out with his exercise business wrightfit.</p>

<p>He said: 'It's a pleasure being out today in the sun, motivating people, that's what it's all about.'  </p>

<p>Just over there: The myth of their separation was broken at one point, as it became clear they were just a few hundred metres away</p>
