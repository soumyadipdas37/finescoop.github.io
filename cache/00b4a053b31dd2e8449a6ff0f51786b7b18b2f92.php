<p>The Blades are understood to have offered £3m plus add-ons for the 19 year-old.</p>

<p>But Arsenal responded by asking for a total package worth in the region of £15m, comprising an initial payment with further bonuses.</p>

<p>Arsenal have turned down an approach from Sheffield United for Folarin Balogun</p>

<p>England Under 19 striker Balogun has less than a year left on his contract.</p>

<p>And Arsenal’s valuation stunned the Blades given Balogun will be free to sign a pre-contract agreement from January to leave at the end of his current deal, a situation which will earn the Gunners a small compensation fee.</p>

<p>Sheffield United are looking to bolster their attacking options with a new striker in the present transfer window.</p>

<p>Their move for Balogun comes amid links with another young England striker in Liverpool's Rhian Brewster.</p>

<p>Chris Wilder's men fired a blank when they began their season on Monday with a 2-0 defeat at home to Wolves. </p>

<p>Arsenal, meanwhile, started with an eye-catching 3-0 win against Fulham but Balogun did not make the substitute bench for the game at Craven Cottage. </p>
