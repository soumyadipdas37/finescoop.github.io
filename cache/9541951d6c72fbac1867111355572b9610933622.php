<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Grant and Chezzi Denyer have one of the strongest marriages in Australian showbiz.</p>

<p>But it wasn't always smooth sailing for the lovebirds, who started their romance when they were both colleagues on Channel Seven's Sunrise in 2005.</p>

<p>Chezzi revealed on their podcast It's All True? that the pair began dating when they were both in relationships with other people.</p>

<p>'It was a rough journey' Grant, 43, and Chezzi Denyer, 40, have revealed their cheating scandal as they spoke candidly about their decade-long marriage on their podcast, It's All True? Pictured here: Melbourne Cup, 2019 </p>

<p>'It was a rough journey - it wasn't like what you see in the movies,' said Chezzi, 40, who was Grant's producer on Sunrise when he joined the program as a weatherman. </p>

<p>When they first got together, Chezzi was married to another man, and Grant, 43, was already dating another woman.</p>

<p>'It was problematic, it took a long time to navigate,' Grant said. </p>

<p>Complex: When they first started their relationship, Chezzi (L) was married to another man while Grant, 43, (R) was already seeing a woman</p>

<p>Working together at Seven complicated matters further, as executives were apparently convinced Chezzi was 'leaking' stories about the pair to the press.</p>

<p>She feared the network would send her off to Cairns or Townsville as a punishment, but instead she decided to leave television altogether.</p>

<p>'In the end I left TV. I couldn't deal with it. My parents were petrified. I basically ran away and moved back to Bathurst,' she said. </p>

<p>The Denyers didn't confirm their relationship for a while, and even Grant's family didn't know how serious things were between them.</p>

<p>But everything changed when Grant broke his back in a monster truck accident in 2008. </p>

<p>'At the time we hadn't confirmed our relationship,' Chezzi said. 'Grant's family didn't know about me but we had been living together for three months.' </p>

<p>Complicated: 'At the time we hadn't confirmed our relationship,' Chezzi said. 'Grant's family didn't know about me but we had been living together for three months'</p>

<p>Grant's mother apparently didn't want the couple living together, fearing Chezzi was a 'gold digger', but they persevered nonetheless.  </p>

<p>Chezzi remained by her husband's side every step of the way during his recovery, and they ended up marrying in 2010.</p>

<p>They share two daughters, Sailor, eight, and Scout, four, and Chezzi recently confirmed she was pregnant with their third child. </p>

<p>Hard times: Chezzi remained by his side every step of his recovery after he broke his back in 2008 due to a monster truck accident. The couple ended-up marrying each other in 2010</p>

<p>Grant said their unfiltered podcast was a way of the couple setting the record straight on tabloid stories concerning their marriage.  </p>

<p>'This could be a platform for us to level with you and tell you what the hell is true and what isn't true,' he explained.</p>
