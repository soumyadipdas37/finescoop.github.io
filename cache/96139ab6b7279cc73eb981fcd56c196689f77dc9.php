<p>Therese Ryan attempted to claim $2.36million from Brian Harrison's estate following the death of the Cairns District Court judge in October last year.</p>

<p>Ms Ryan had been divorced from Mr Harrison since 1993 and said she suffered from anxiety and depression after she claimed her former partner was 'violent' and possessive. </p>

<p>She has been living on a disability support pension and claimed Mr Harrison had a 'strong moral obligation' to support her, Courier Mail reported. </p>

<p>However Justice Glenn Martin ruled that Ms Ryan should not be considered a 'spouse'.</p>

<p>He said the bulk of the estate would instead go to Mr Harrison's former carer and housekeeper Rampai Harrison - who he married in 2018.</p>

<p>Instead, Ms Ryan has been ordered to cover the estate's costs of the proceedings. </p>

<p>Therese Ryan attempted to claim $2.36million from Brian Harrison's (pictured) estate following the death of the Cairns District Court judge in October last year </p>

<p>The decision comes after the Queen's Counsel for the estate Rebecca Treston told the court in August that Ms Ryan was not entitled to any provision from the state as a former spouse.</p>

<p>She argued Ms Ryan was not a dependent receiving maintenance at the time of Mr Harrison's death.  </p>

<p>Ms Ryan's counsel, Gerard Forde, said Ms Ryan did not apply for further maintenance in court before the judge's death as she 'feared for her safety'.  </p>

<p>Ms Ryan claimed in an affidavit that she divorced Mr Harrison following 'extremely violent' behaviour.  </p>

<p>'After our marriage … the deceased became very controlling and abusive on all levels; financially, emotionally, psychologically and physically,' Ms Ryan said in the affidavit.</p>

<p>'This was my first experience with domestic violence and it devastated me and resulted in my lifelong symptoms of depression, anxiety and … mental torture for me.' </p>

<p>Ms Ryan said Mr Harrison 'would erupt into one of his wild, violent and dangerous rages' if he did not approve of something she did.</p>

<p>She confirmed in the affidavit he had deliberately set their house on fire on June 2, 1991 - and alleged lawyers colluded to cover up the blaze, which Mr Harrison was not charged over. </p>

<p>Though Justice Glenn Martin decided last Tuesday Ms Ryan was not considered to be a 'spouse' and that the bulk of the estate would go to Mr Harrison's (left) former carer and housekeeper Rampai Harrison (right) - whom he married in 2018 </p>

<p>Earlier this month, ABC printed details from court documents revealing Ms Ryan alleged her then husband 'controlled every aspect' of her life, including paying her a wage she could only spend on 'household expenses, including groceries'.  </p>

<p>The documents revealed she felt 'worthless, powerless, depressed and in a constant state of anxiety because if I ever did something he didn't approve of, he would erupt into one of his wild, violent and dangerous rages'. </p>

<p>'I often saw Therese with bruises and a swollen nose and believed at the time that she was clearly a victim of domestic violence,' Helen Jarvis, the couple's housekeeper from 1990 to 1992, wrote in an affidavit. </p>

<p>Benjamin Ryan, a pathologist and one of Ms Ryan's sons from another marriage, said in an affidavit earlier in August: 'He would push her into walls and punch her about the head and face and when sometimes she fell to the floor, he would kick her in the stomach.' </p>

<p>Ms Kumkuang was Mr Harrison's former carer and housekeeper until they married in 2018</p>
