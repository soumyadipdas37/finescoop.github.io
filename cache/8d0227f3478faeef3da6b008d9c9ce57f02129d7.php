<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows portrayed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head as out of the loop on the heels of Dr. Robert Redfield saying coronavirus vaccines wouldn't be readily available until mid-2021. </p>

<p>'I'm not saying he's not part of the process, I'm saying he's not closest to the decision making as it relates to the clinical 3 trials and the distribution thereof,' Meadows told reporters outside the White House Thursday. </p>

<p>Meadows was echoing comments made by President Donald Trump at Wednesday's press briefing, as the president pushed back on the two sound bites that came out of Redfield's testimony earlier in the day before a Senate committee. </p>

<p>White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows told reporters Thursday morning that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention head, Dr. Robert Redfield, was 'not closest to the decision making' when it came to the timeline of COVID-19 vaccine distribution </p>

<p>President Donald Trump contradicted his own CDC chief at Wednesday's press briefing, calling Dr. Robert Redfield 'confused' and 'mistaken' for saying vaccines wouldn't be widely available until halfway through 2021 and masks work better than vaccines </p>

<p>Dr. Robert Redfield testified Wednesday morning before a Senate committee and said a ' face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.' He also said a COVID-19 vaccine wouldn't be widely available until quarter two or three of 2021 </p>

<p>Trump said the CDC head was 'confused' and 'made a mistake' when he told lawmakers most Americans wouldn't get a COVID-19 vaccine until the 'second or third quarter' of 2021 - meaning a full year from now.   </p>

<p>The president also said that Redfield must have 'misunderstood' a question on masks. </p>

<p>Redfield held up his mask during testimony and said, 'I might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against COVID than when I take a COVID vaccine.'</p>

<p>'No, the mask is not more important than the vaccine,' Trump said, telling reporters he called Redfield earlier Wednesday to set him straight.</p>

<p>Meadows agreed with Trump on that too. </p>

<p>'If masks truly were the answer where everybody can go back to work, and that they actually worked as the best protocol for keeping people safe, I think everyone would be more than happy to wear their masks and return to work,' Meadows told the press. 'I don't think the science backs that up. I think it's extra precaution and it's good, but it doesn't necessarily make sure that you're, you're not going to come down with COVID.' </p>

<p>The comments the president made at the briefing pushed a Redfield spokesperson to release a statement saying the CDC head was 'answering a question he thought was in regard to the time period in which all Americans would have completed their COVID vaccination.' </p>

<p>'He was not referring to the time period when COVID-19 vaccine doses would be made available to all Americans,' the spokesperson said. </p>

<p>Redfield was also quoted talking up a coronavirus vaccine in the briefing's aftermath. </p>

<p>'I 100 per cent believe in the importance of vaccines and the importance in particular of a COVID-19 vaccine. A COVID-19 vaccine is the thing that will get Americans back to normal everyday life,' Redfield said.  </p>

<p>'The best defense we currently have against this virus are the important mitigation efforts of wearing a mask, washing your hands, social distancing and being careful about crowds,' he added.  </p>

<p>Meadows suggested that Redfield wasn't fully clued in on the vaccine process because trials were being done by private companies.  </p>

<p>The White House chief of staff also slightly disparaged the agency. </p>

<p>'Generally speaking, speed of development and speed of distribution is not the strong suit for the CDC, and we saw that going back to the early days of the testing regimen that aws put forth,' Meadows said.  </p>

<p>Meadows then doubled down on the president's abbreviated timeline. </p>

<p>'I can tell you the president is pushing very hard to make sure that we're deliverying a vaccine before the end of the year,' he said. 'I'm not sure where Dr. Redfield got his particular timetable, but it's not based on those that are closest to the process.'   </p>
