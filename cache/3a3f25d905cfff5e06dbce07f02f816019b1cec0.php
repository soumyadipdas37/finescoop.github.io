<p>Those behind the poll said: 'The results show a city divided and pessimistic—especially among those least able to afford the city—and consistent support, across partisan divides, for certain reforms.' </p>

<p>Two in five of those questioned said that they would leave the city, if they had the ability to live anywhere they wanted with the economy and public safety the two leading worries for New Yorkers. The NYPD got the support of 53 per cent of the city; 40 per cent disapprove of the unit. </p>

<p>The suspect began rifling through the rabbi’s pockets and grabbed some cash, but when they found Kass’ police shield, they dropped it and fled on foot, cops say.</p>
