<p>Noel Nubla, who witnessed the attacks and tried to subdue the assailant, told CBS Local McGlone also pulled out a knife.</p>

<p>'Once we got outside we were kind of just bumping fists. He got me in the face a couple of times, I got him back and he started bleeding,' he said.</p>

<p>'And then I took him down to the ground. I saw him pull out a knife - I pulled him down.</p>

<p>'He got to the floor, his hand was there. I stepped on it, stepped on his wrist pulled him up disarmed him from the knife.' </p>

<p>Witnesses also said McGlone was yelling something about his daughter during the attack. </p>

<p>Police said officers then arrived on the scene and talked McGlone into dropping the weapon.</p>

<p>He was arrested and taken into custody. </p>

<p>The victims had singed hair (pictured) but were otherwise unharmed in the attacks. McGlone was arrested and is now facing felony charges over the attacks</p>

<p>White said a search of McGlone uncovered knives including a machete, matches, lighters and several ‘Molotov cocktails'.  </p>

<p>Police later learned McGlone had allegedly set a trashcan on fire outside Kathmandu Market &amp; Deli around 20 minutes before his first attack on the diners.  </p>

<p>McGlone was charged Wednesday with 10 felonies including four counts of assault with caustic chemicals, two counts of criminal threats, assault with a deadly weapon, arson, possession of a destructive device and other allegations.</p>

<p>He was denied bail and is being held in Santa Rita Jail. </p>

<p>The victims had singed hair but were otherwise unharmed in the attacks. </p>
