<p>This comes after a source claimed Bert's recent battle with pneumonia 'shook him to the core'.</p>

<p>'When he had a health scare with pneumonia in 2017, it shook him to the core,' an insider told the publication in April.</p>

<p>'He realised he was actually vulnerable and that terrified him. He knew he had a close call and had to take far better care of himself.'</p>

<p>Bert's health first became a concern in 2012 when he underwent a quadruple bypass.</p>

<p>In the years following the heart surgery, he was hospitalised three times with pneumonia and was also diagnosed with anemia.</p>

<p>Anemia can make a person feel tired or weak because there are not enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues.</p>

<p>The four-time Gold Logie winner told reporters outside hospital in 2017 that he was feeling better after being treated for pneumonia.</p>

<p>'I'm feeling better now. It took a while. I didn't realise until I copped it the first time, that pneumonia is such a serious thing, but I'm feeling better now,' he said.</p>
