<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It is extremely unlikely you will stumble across Howard’s House Hotel, tucked as it is deep in the Wiltshire countryside at the bottom of a valley in the tiny village of Teffont Evias.</p>

<p>Do seek it out though if exploring the Nadder Valley, on your way to Stonehenge or Salisbury.</p>

<p>In the village, honey-stoned cottages and a converted manor house run along the clear chalk stream which wends its way past St Michael’s church.</p>

<p>Secluded: Howard’s House Hotel is tucked away at the bottom of a valley in the tiny village of Teffont Evias, Wiltshire</p>

<p>It is an enchanting sight, flanked by sloping fields where cows graze, and so deserted that, but for the odd passing car, it could be a scene from centuries ago.</p>

<p>Without the sign hanging outside you might miss the family-owned Howard’s House. Rather than a rambling hotel, this 17th Century former dower house to the original manor is now Grade II listed with petite proportions throughout the dining room, lounge and snug.</p>

<p>Undulating, landscaped gardens with lawn and flower-packed borders draw guests outside to eat on the terrace, and, even on a rainy Monday in August, business is brisk at lunch, tea and dinner.</p>

<p>Inside the elegant coach house, which is now a venue for private events such as wedding receptions</p>

<p>The Mail on Sunday's Sarah Hartley was impressed with head chef Andy Britton's 'exceptional' culinary talents </p>

<p>Head chef Andy Britton shows off his exceptional talents with a dinner of salmon, watermelon, edible violets and ginger so prettily arranged it’s a pity to disturb. But it is soon devoured, as too the duck, pea and pomegranate followed by the lightest passionfruit souffle with mango sorbet.</p>

<p>With the rooms, it’s all about the outlook: original shutters frame Gothic windows set in thick mellow stone. The adjoining coach house is now a venue for private events such as wedding receptions. </p>

<p>Outside, you can follow a path to the kitchen garden to see how far your fruit, veg and herbs travel before they reach your plate. You’ll meet Howard’s Legbar hens who give the scrambled eggs at breakfast their golden glow (best eaten with ‘home honey-roasted Wiltshire ham’).</p>

<p>Rest: There are ten individually decorated rooms with comfy beds and all have White Company products</p>

<p>If you must head out, wonderful walks nearby include one to the National Trust’s Dinton Park.</p>

<p>The USP: Traditional English village setting and romantic garden.</p>

<p>The rooms: Ten, individually decorated with comfy beds. If you are into four-posters, ask for Room Three. For views of the gardens, book Room One. All have White Company products.</p>

<p>The food: Whether sampling simple kidney bean and red onion houmous with bread, tomato gazpacho or succulent beef carpaccio at dinner, or an afternoon tea, you will find room for just one more mouthful.</p>
