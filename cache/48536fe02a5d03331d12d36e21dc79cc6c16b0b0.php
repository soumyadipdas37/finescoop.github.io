<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jeremy Hunt: I’m backing The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to end lone births, which has been championed in Parliament by my formidable colleague Alicia Kearns</p>

<p>Covid has brought many hidden tragedies: elderly residents in care homes bereft of family visits, families in quarantine missing loved one’s funerals, and mums forced to go through labour alone. </p>

<p>Much of this has been necessary, however painful, but I fear we’re getting the balance badly wrong in maternity care. </p>

<p>That’s why I’m backing The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to end lone births, which has been championed in Parliament by my formidable colleague Alicia Kearns.</p>

<p>Infection control in hospitals is critically important, but mothers’ mental health can’t be pushed down the priority list.</p>

<p>Imagine the agony of a new mum sent for a scan on her own, only to be told that her much longed-for baby has no heartbeat. Or the woman labouring in agony for hours who is told she is not yet sufficiently dilated to merit her partner joining her for moral support.</p>

<p>I have heard some truly heartbreaking stories, which quite frankly should have no place in a modern, compassionate health service. One woman who gave birth to a stillborn baby alone at 41 weeks; another woman who was left alone after surgery due to a miscarriage at 12 weeks.</p>

<p>Perhaps most concerningly of all, there are reports of partners being asked to leave their new babies and often traumatised mothers almost immediately after birth. </p>

<p>That means they miss out on vital bonding time and mums lose crucial support to help them recover mentally and physically, in some cases with partners not allowed back to meet their new child properly for several days.</p>

<p>I know from the birth of my own three wonderful children just how critical those first few hours and days can be.</p>

<p>For families, it simply feels crushingly unfair and illogical that six people can meet in a pub and 30 people can go shooting, yet mothers have to go through one of life’s most harrowing and precious milestones alone.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we desperately need to sort out our mass population testing regime so that hospitals have confidence asymptomatic visitors aren’t unwittingly spreading infection.</p>

<p>I know that both the Health Secretary and the Prime Minister spoke sympathetically about this issue in the House of Commons last week, and health organisations have recently developed a framework for the local reintroduction of hospital visitors and individuals accompanying women to appointments.</p>

<p>But I don’t think a voluntary framework will end the arbitrary way these rules are being applied by some hospitals.</p>

<p>A postcode lottery is unacceptable on a matter of this importance.</p>

<p>As Churchill said, ‘action this day’ is required to ensure no mum in any corner of the country is forced to go through labour or birth alone.</p>

<p>This is a question of basic compassion and decency – the very values that the NHS embodies and the reason we’re all so proud of our universal health service – so we need every hospital to commit to urgent action without delay.</p>
