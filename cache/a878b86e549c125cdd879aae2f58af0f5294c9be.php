<p>The search for the solo Channel swimmer began shortly after midday. He was picked up by a passing vessel at around 8pm having made it just 500 yards out of Dover </p>

<p>He has been brought to shore and will be checked over by ambulance staff.</p>

<p>The incident was not related to migrant crossings.</p>

<p>A coastguard spokesperson said: 'At around 12.10pm today HM Coastguard received a call from a member of the public with information that their friend was swimming unaccompanied to Calais from Dover.</p>

<p>'Coastguard rescue teams from Deal and Langdon, RNLI lifeboats from Dover and Dungness and coastguard search and rescue helicopters from Lydd and Lee-on-Solent were sent.</p>

<p>'Vessels in the area were asked to keep a sharp lookout and Kent Police, Dover Port Police and Dover Port were informed.</p>

<p>'The swimmer was spotted shortly before 8pm by a passing vessel only 500 metres off Dover and was taken onboard the RNLI Dungeness lifeboat, cold and tired but otherwise well.</p>

<p>'He has been brought to shore and will be checked over by South East Ambulance Service.'</p>

<p>Air temperatures in Dover on Monday afternoon were about 17C with winds of up to 10mph, according to the Met Office.</p>

<p>The fastest ever swim across the Channel is a little over seven hours and across the shortest route, measured at 21 miles, great care and planning must be undertaken to avoid colossal cargo vessels. </p>
