<p>Set in fictionalised wellness resort 'Tranquillum', Nine Perfect Strangers is being partially filmed at real luxury retreat, Soma Byron Bay.  </p>

<p>Local Ray White real estate agent Matthew McCormack told Daily Mail Australia: 'Nicole Kidman's show took 60 houses for six months - that's a $100 million project, and it's brought a lot of money and people to the area.'  </p>

<p>Nicole and her family are expected to reside in the beach town for the next 15 weeks as she continues to film the Hulu series - which she also stars in.</p>

<p>Nine Perfect Strangers is based on Liane Moriarty's bestselling novel of the same name.</p>

<p>In July, Nicole told The Daily Telegraph, she's 'thrilled' to be able to bring the $100 million production and hundreds of jobs to the local film industry, after it was sent crashing down by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>There are three separate productions underway in Byron at the moment, attracting further cast and crew to the region.  </p>
