<p>Madeleine spoke about their split on The Kyle and Jackie O show last year.</p>

<p>'I'm a big believer that everything in life has a season... we change, we evolve.</p>

<p>'I don't think that's fair to the children either, to see two parents that are constantly at cross-purposes,' she continued.   </p>
