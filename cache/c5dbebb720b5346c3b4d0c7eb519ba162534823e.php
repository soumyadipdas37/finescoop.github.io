<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bachelor's resident 'boss lady' Areeba Emmanuel has hit back at whingeing former contestants who insist the reality show is 'fake' and 'scripted'.</p>

<p>The outspoken 25-year-old said on Thursday that the most surprising thing about filming The Bachelor was just how genuine the whole experience was.</p>

<p>While she didn't mention any of her co-stars by name, Areeba's comments appear to be in reference to claims made by ex-bachelorette Nadine Kodsi last month. </p>

<p>Setting the record straight: The Bachelor's resident 'boss lady' Areeba Emmanuel (pictured) has hit back at whingeing former contestants who insist the reality show is 'fake' and 'scripted'</p>

<p>Nadine tried to publicly expose the show as 'staged' after being eliminated on the first episode, claiming that Locky Gilbert was told what to say via an earpiece.</p>

<p>But Areeba, who was sent packing on Wednesday's show before production went into lockdown, told Now To Love that this couldn't be further from the truth.</p>

<p>'Well, a lot of people would say that the show is all pre-planned, like "Oh the producer made me say it", but the biggest surprise was actually realising that it was reality TV,' she said.</p>

<p>'We genuinely had no idea who Locky was. So the first time I ever met him was when I got out of that car. They don't tell you anything. It can be quite annoying, actually.'</p>

<p>Just days before the Bachelor's season premiere last month, Nadine had told Daily Mail Australia that the first days of filming were carefully choreographed.</p>

<p>She said the producers were 'evil', that Locky was a 'puppet', and that the women were pushed into behaving in a certain way.</p>

<p>Nadine has since gone out of her way to sabotage this year's season, putting her at risk of legal consequences by breaking her participation agreement with Channel 10 and Warner Bros.</p>

<p>She recently shared an Instagram post 'leaking' Locky's final two contestants: Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska.</p>

<p>However, these women have been the bookies' favourites for weeks, so her insight was hardly groundbreaking.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>
