<p>'We tailor for anyone', said Jade, 'no age is a barrier, male or female, there is a wide span of our customer range. During lockdown we had a surge because of isolation issues surrounding people, young old, anybody.</p>

<p>'Every time a restriction would come into place, I would see surges and these dolls are very much companion dolls, when people come to my website they’re looking for more than just a sex toy. </p>

<p>'This is a companion, this is someone to sit in your home and bring a lot of happiness into people’s lives'. </p>

<p>'You've seen an increase in sales of male dolls haven't you' , asked host Holly Willoughby.</p>

<p>'I have', she replied, 'A really large increase in male dolls, there’s a really big market, and transexual dolls as well. </p>

<p>'Couples, the safe threesome. I’m actually in the process of setting up a pop up shop, because couple’s usually want to view the doll before they purchase.' </p>

<p>'There are a lot of people out there who see a doll as a presence', she told, 'Like having a dog or cat in your home, they do warm up we can put voice boxes in which is quite a big request.'</p>

<p>She explained that some customers buy their dolls simply so they can prop it up in a chair, or pose it lying in their bed.  </p>

<p>'It is the fact I have customers who buy dolls to just sit in the chair or lie in a bed and that, unfortunately, does take the place of a real person, said Jade. </p>

<p>Jade's most expensive dolls cost up to £8,000, but customers are able to design their companion in any way they want</p>

<p>'Social media has made people interactive online but not outside, this is a really Covid safe way of having psychical interaction with someone'.  </p>

<p>'You make the doll completely bespoke to your liking', Jade explained, 'You choose everything, the dimensions of the doll you’d have, the hair implanted which looks better, you choose every aspect of that doll. </p>

<p>'That again has brought a lot of comfort to people, if that’s what people want to do who are we to judge?'</p>
