<p>And Molly-Mae Hague, 21, looked sensational as she modelled a white jumpsuit with a stylish corset detail during a recent shoot for the online brand.</p>

<p>It comes as PLT announces that they're looking for five 'next level babes' to become the new faces of the brand and work alongside the existing model squad.</p>

<p>Sizzling: Molly-Mae Hague looked sensational in a white jumpsuit with a corset front during a recent PrettyLittleThing photoshoot</p>

<p>Molly-Mae flaunted her curves in the figure-hugging jumpsuit, which boasted a plunging neckline to accentuate her ample assets.</p>

<p>The beauty tied her long blonde locks back into a sleek ponytail and and kept her accessories to a minimum with a pair of clear heels.</p>

<p>During the shoot Molly-Mae also slipped into a pair of wide-leg jeans with rips over the knees and flashed her taut midriff while lifting her grey jumper.</p>

<p>While in a third stylish look, the Love Island star wore a light grey t-shirt with a ribbed detail under the bust and a silver chain necklace.</p>

<p>Work it: The Love Island star was sure to work all her angles as she posed up a storm in the tight one-piece and a pair of clear heels</p>

<p>Casual chic: Molly-Mae also slipped into a grey logo jumper and white ripped jeans</p>

<p>The sizzling snaps from Molly-Mae's shoot come as PLT announce they're launching an UK and Ireland wide search for the next faces of the brand in October.   </p>

<p>Speaking exclusively with MailOnline, the company explained how they're looking for five 'next level babes' to represent their brand.</p>

<p>PLT said they're after diverse individuals who aren't afraid to be themselves, standout and who exude beauty inside and out.</p>

<p>The lucky winners will receive a prize valued at five figures which includes a one-year contract with newly-launched The Four Model Management and the chance to be the face of a PrettyLittleThing campaign. </p>

<p>Looking good: She accessorised her second look with a pair of stylish chunky hoop earrings</p>

<p>Toned: The blonde beauty flashed a glimpse of her taut midriff as she lifted up her jumper</p>

<p>Poser: Molly-Mae added a full face of makeup including a slick of brozer and a nude lipstick to accentuate her pretty features</p>

<p>This global campaign will give the winners a chance to be seen by millions and include a two-day location shoot with the rest of the winning model squad. </p>

<p>The winning models will also be treated to a press and influencer dinner to celebrate the campaign launch.</p>

<p>To be in with the chance of launching into model stardom, hopefuls have to submit a maximum for four pictures. PLT said a mixture of head and full length shots would be preferred but not essential.</p>

<p>However a major factor in the application is that no filters or editing can be used on the submitted images – the brand is after natural beauty.</p>

<p>Third act: The star also modelled a grey t-shirt with a ribbed detail under the bust</p>

<p>Sleek: She wore her long blonde locks tied back into a ponytail for the photoshoot</p>

<p>Alongside the competition, PrettyLittleThing founder and CEO Umar Kamani is launching a new agency Four Model Management.</p>

<p>The modelling agency will be based in Manchester, with Umar saying he's 'incredibly excited to bring to life our new agency'.</p>

<p>The businessman said: 'We plan to become the next generation of modelling agencies and will bring the next level of diverse, inclusive and freshest faces to the table.' </p>

<p>While a spokesperson for Four Model Management added: 'With the industry changing at such a fast pace we rely on our experienced staff members to be one step ahead at finding the NEXT TOP THING. </p>

<p>Style: Molly-Mae has launched several collections with PLT and recently signed another six-figure deal with the online fashion brand</p>

<p>'As a global management we aim to represent the strongest and most diverse individuals all over the world ensuring they have the correct care, management and support in the industry. </p>

<p>'The Four aims to launch the most explosive vibe to the model world ultimately becoming the next new powerhouse in the game!' </p>

<p>The announcement comes after Molly-Mae recently revealed that she was giving away a massive haul of goods – including Louis Vuitton bags – as she celebrated garnering 1million YouTube subscribers. </p>

<p>However, she soon found herself to be the target of relentless trolling on Twitter, after several men complained that the competition post, which has been liked and shared more than 1 million times, was clogging up their feeds.</p>

<p>As the complaints ramped up on the site, the reality star clapped back and wryly tweeted: '£10 to any boy that's not tweeted '£10 to any girl thats not entered Molly-Mae's giveaway'..... terms and conditions apply x.'</p>

<p>Exciting: PrettyLittleThing's CEO Umar Kamani is now launching his own modelling agency and a search for FIVE new faces of the PLT</p>

<p>However, Molly-Mae later revealed on her Instagram Stories that the negative comments had hit a nerve. </p>

<p>She said: 'I've been kind of trying to not look at Twitter too much just because even though it's meant to be a lovely thing and something we can all enjoy together people still have their mad opinions on it always. </p>

<p>'I'm one of those people that do tend to read things and I do tend to let it get to me.</p>

<p>'But I just made this giveaway for something for us all to enjoy together, a way that we can celebrate having a million subscribers together and also a way for me to give back was the main thing.  </p>

<p>'I wouldn't have any of this stuff without you guys, I wouldn't be able to do any of the things I do. Like even be where I am now in Milan, that wouldn't be happening without you guys, so it's just a way I can give back and say thank you, really.' </p>

<p>Can't believe it: It comes after the blonde beauty revealed the winner to her £8k giveaway on Instagram</p>
