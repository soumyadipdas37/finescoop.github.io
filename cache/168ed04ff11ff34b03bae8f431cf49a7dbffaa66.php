<p>Metropolitan Police officer Sgt Ratana was killed when alleged gunman Louis De Zoysa, 23, who had been arrested for alleged possession of ammunition and Class B drugs in south London, was brought into his police station in Croydon.</p>

<p>Despite being cuffed and searched outside, the suspect is believed to have smuggled a revolver inside and shot Sgt Ratana as he took his temperature to comply with Covid regulations.</p>

<p>Police searches have been taking place at Banstead in Surrey as well as in South London</p>

<p>Five shots were fired at 2.15am on Friday, including one which left De Zoysa in hospital. Detectives have as yet been unable to speak to him.  </p>

<p>No police firearms were discharged in the incident, and the case is not being treated as terror-related.</p>

<p>Another man arrested following the fatal shooting of Sgt Ratana on suspicion of supplying a firearm was released on bail on Wednesday. </p>

<p>The man from Norwich was bailed until October as police searches continued at the home of alleged gunman De Zoysa, 23, in Norbury, South London.</p>

<p>Detectives investigating the murder of Sergeant Ratana at Croydon custody centre last Friday have also been searching an area in Banstead, Surrey.</p>

<p>The Banstead location includes access to several derelict buildings and more than 30 acres of land, with police saying the 'complex' search will take days to complete. </p>

<p>The custody centre remains a crime scene, while searches in Pollards Hill, where De Zoysa was arrested, and a location in central London have also been carried out.</p>

<p>It came as further details about De Zoysa emerged on Tuesday, including that he excelled at the Catholic John Fisher School in Purley, South London.</p>

<p>De Zoysa, whose school yearbook entry said he was 'good with weapons', went on to study mechanical engineering at University College London.</p>

<p>Friends said he was very intelligent but dropped out after just a year. De Zoysa and his four siblings were brought up by their translator mother and yoga teacher father.</p>

<p>Friends have previously spoken of their middle-class lifestyle and his younger brother now attends Oxford University.</p>

<p>But one neighbour who knew the family well said the De Zoysa house was notorious in the street for loud arguments and aggressive dogs which were bred for money.</p>

<p>Speaking yesterday, the source said that his father Channa, from Sri Lanka, struggled to hold down regular employment.</p>

<p>The neighbour also claimed to have witnessed arguments which spilled out into the street.</p>

<p>Five shots were fired at 2.15am on Friday, including one which left alleged gunman Louis De Zoysa (pictured) in hospital. Detectives have as yet been unable to speak to him</p>

<p>Police searches continued yesterday at the home of De Zoysa, 23, in Norbury, South London</p>

<p>It backs up reports that De Zoysa's British mother, Elizabeth, took out a restraining order against her husband in 2015. This was withdrawn last year when they reconciled.</p>

<p>The neighbour added that she filed a police report when De Zoysa was in his early teens, claiming to have heard gun shots from the garden of the property.  </p>

<p>'Some neighbours felt bullied by them,' she said. 'The family were known because their dogs would bark all the time. They were like wild guard dogs.</p>

<p>'The family had some really bad problems. I would often hear loud arguments with very strong language. '   </p>

<p>Colleagues with the Met, local and international sportsmen, and the Prince of Wales were among those paying their respects to Sgt Ratana following his death.</p>

<p>Su Bushby, his partner of five years, described him as her 'gentle giant', while the House of Commons also fell silent on Monday in tribute.</p>

<p>An inquest into Sgt Ratana's death is due to open and adjourn in Croydon later on today. </p>
