<p>Parents who have been denied refunds for cancelled school trips should get their money back, says the competition watchdog.</p>

<p>In June, Money Mail revealed how one junior rugby team from Jarrow, Tyne and Wear, was battling for a £30,000 refund after its trip to Orlando, in Florida, U.S., was cancelled.</p>

<p>Under consumer law, holidaymakers should be refunded within 14 days for cancelled package holidays. </p>

<p>But many firms have refused to pay back groups, as they are not individuals.</p>

<p>However, the Competition and Markets Authority has now told travel firms: 'Consumers will generally be entitled to a refund when they have paid in advance for services or goods that cannot be provided because of legal restrictions as a result of the pandemic.'</p>
