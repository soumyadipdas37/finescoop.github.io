<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Range Rover has added a new £57,000 electrified plug-in hybrid option to its refreshed and upgraded Velar 4X4 line up.</p>

<p>The aerodynamically-shaped mid-size luxury SUV, which sits between the Range Rover Evoque and Range Rover Sport, is gaining a new additional P400e model variant combining a 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with a 105kW electric motor.</p>

<p>The set-up produces a combined 404 horsepower, which propels the Velar from 0-to-60mph in 5.1 seconds (0-62mph in 5.4 seconds) up to a top speed of 149mph - and 33 miles can be covered without the unleaded motor kicking in.</p>

<p>Electrified: Range Rover has added a new £57,000 plug-in hybrid model to its range</p>

<p>With the 17.1kWh lithium ion battery fully charged, it can be driven for 33 miles in pure electric mode</p>

<p>The 17.1Wh lithium-ion battery housed under the floor of the boot can be charged to 80 per cent in just 30 minute using a fast DC charge point, or in 1 hour 40 minutes using a standard 7kW domestic wallbox. That rises to 5 hours 29 minutes on a domestic plug – enough to give an overnight charge.</p>

<p>As a hybrid, linked to an eight speed automatic transmission, it has a claimed average overall fuel economy of 130.2mpg and CO2 emissions from 49g/km.</p>

<p>There are three driving modes: EV (Electric Vehicle) mode, which enables the vehicle to prioritise running solely on the electric power using the energy stored in the battery, for quiet, zero emissions journeys up to 33 miles with a full battery charge; Hybird (also the ‘default’ driving mode), combining petrol and electric drive in the most efficient manner; and finally Save model that prioritises the petrol combustion engine to conserve the battery to be used when needed – such as when entering urban areas. </p>

<p>The plug-in hybrid p400e is priced from £56,550 up to £71,020 for the range-topping R Dynamic HSE. The Velar ranged itself is priced from £46,110 for the base D200 specification.</p>

<p>The battery can be charged to 80% in just 30 minute using a fast DC charge point, or in 1 hour 40 minutes using a standard 7kW domestic wallbox</p>

<p>Land Rover said the plug-in hybrid Velar ‘offers customers the perfect balance of design and technology – now with electric power'.</p>

<p>Colin Kirkpatrick, chief product engineer for the Range Rover Velar, said: ‘It’s smooth and enjoyable to drive, while delivering the same power as a 3-litre petrol engine with more torque and better fuel consumption. We’ve also maintained the Velar’s all-terrain ability, with equivalent ground clearance on the plug-in hybrid as its non-electric counterpart.’</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a new family of 3.0-litre straight-six Ingenium 400 horse-power petrol and 300 horse-power diesel engines is also introduced to the Range Rover Velar for the first time, all with 48-volt mild hybrid electric vehicle technology for reduced fuel consumption and heightened refinement.</p>

<p>The set-up produces a combined 404 horsepower, which propels the Velar from 0-to-60mph in 5.1 seconds (0-62mph in 5.4 seconds) up to a top speed of 149mph</p>

<p>Land Rover said the plug-in hybrid Velar ‘offers customers the perfect balance of design and technology – now with electric power'</p>

<p>The plug-in hybrid p400e is priced from £56,550 up to £71,020 for the range-topping R Dynamic HSE</p>

<p>The new P400 straight-six engine delivers allows Velar to accelerate from 0 to 60mph in 5.2 seconds (0 to 62mph in 5.5 seconds.) The engine features an electric supercharger supported by a twin scroll turbocharger.</p>

<p>The D300 in-line diesel offers 0 to 60mph in 6.1 seconds (0 to 62mph in 6.5 seconds) with fuel economy of up to 37.2mpg and CO2 from 199g/km. It also meets latest emission standards including Euro 6d-final real-world driving compliance.</p>

<p>The next generation four-cylinder Ingenium D200 (204 horse-power diesel) offers more power, lower CO2 of 165g/km and improved fuel economy of up to 44.9mpg.</p>

<p>Inside are integrated digital screens fitted with Land Rover’s Pivi and Pivi Pro infotainment systems. Land Rover says: ‘Customers can access software updates ‘over-the-air’ reducing the need to visit a retailer.’</p>

<p>Land Rover said the experience inside the Range Rover Velar is now ‘an even calmer sanctuary’ thanks to the addition of ‘active road noise cancellation technology. </p>

<p>This works like a pair of noise cancellation headphones, constantly monitoring vibrations from the road surface and calculating the opposing sound wave needed to remove or cancel-out the noise heard by the occupants.</p>

<p>Land Rover said: ‘The effect is subtle, but the minimum reduction of 4 decibels ensures an even more refined and calming interior space.</p>

<p>‘This advanced system delivers a more serene experience inside Velar, even reducing driver tiredness, which can be brought about by extended exposure to low-frequency sound on long journeys.’</p>

<p>A new cabin air filtration system reduces levels of harmful particulates, pollen, allergens, and even odours and helps keep the driver and occupants feeling fresh.</p>

<p>New design features include a steering wheel with integrated smart buttons ready to receive the latest software updates over-the-air.</p>

<p>A tactile new ‘Drive’ selector replaces the rotary gear version. </p>

<p>The firm said: ‘The Range Rover Velar is now even more desirable, sustainable and intelligent with the introduction of an electric plug-in hybrid option, advanced new infotainment technology and elegant new design features.’</p>

<p>Nick Rogers, executive director for product engineering at Jaguar Land Rover said: ‘The Range Rover Velar’s name and bloodline dates back to the code name of the original Range Rover prototypes. It has been fifty years since the introduction of the pioneering Range Rover in 1970, and now every family member is electrified with our awesome plug-in hybrid technology.’</p>

<p>He added: ‘Electrified powertrains and cleaner mild hybrid diesel engines mean the Velar is an even more efficient and sustainable option for our customers. ‘</p>
