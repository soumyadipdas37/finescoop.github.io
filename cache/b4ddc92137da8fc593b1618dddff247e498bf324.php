<p>The Devon-born M&amp;S model, 33, lives in LA with her fiance, Hollywood hardman Jason Statham, and son Jack, three.</p>

<p>And she’s regularly told she needs injections of toxins. </p>

<p>She is one of the world’s most beautiful women, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley (pictured at the #REVOLVEawards 2019 at Goya Studios in Hollywood, California) feels under pressure to submit to cosmetic treatments nevertheless</p>

<p>‘I’m cautious, especially in LA where people are like, “Do you want breakfast and Botox?” and I’m like, “Uh, no. I’ll take the breakfast and you can keep the Botox.”’</p>

<p>At least she doesn’t have to fret about her famous pout. </p>

<p>‘I never worry about my lips,’ she adds. ‘They stay in good shape.’ Phew!</p>

<p>Tim Rice suffers an identity crisis</p>

<p>He won an Oscar for The Lion King and made millions with his lyrics for West End hits, but Sir Tim Rice is feeling a little unrecognised.</p>

<p>Reminiscing about working with U.S. pop star Cyndi Lauper in 1989, he says: ‘It was soon clear that she hadn’t a clue who I was, so I managed to subtly inform her that I’d written the words for One Night In Bangkok, which had been a massive hit in the States.</p>

<p>‘And by the time I’d flung Superstar and Evita into the mix, Cyndi’s enthusiasm had perked up a bit.’</p>

<p>He adds: ‘Funnily enough, I met her in a restaurant in Barnes about 25 years later, and on that occasion she thought I was [impresario] Robert Stigwood.’ </p>

<p>Ouch. </p>

<p>Known as the king of Saturday night TV when he presented hit shows such as Stars In Their Eyes and Game For A Laugh, Matthew Kelly has turned down the chance to win a new generation of fans by competing on Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

<p>‘I was offered Strictly,’ he tells me at the first night of Sleepless, A Musical Romance, at the Troubadour Wembley Park Theatre. </p>

<p>‘While the money was good, I turned them down because I need to sell my work, not my life. </p>

<p>'Dancing is not my thing at all, and I don’t really like reality TV shows.’</p>
