<p>Some 2,500 refugees and asylum seekers are to be relocated overall, following coronavirus tests, according to the migration ministry. </p>

<p>It comes three weeks after the sprawling Moria camp on the island burned down leaving more than 12,000 asylum seekers homeless on September 8.</p>

<p>Over 700 people (some pictured) are set to sail to the Greek mainland aboard a ferry on Monday organisers said while another group will leave on Thursday</p>

<p>Some 2,500 refugees and asylum seekers are to be relocated overall (some of the group being transferred today), following coronavirus tests, according to the migration ministry</p>

<p>It comes three weeks after the sprawling Moria camp on the island burned down (the remains of the camp, pictured) leaving more than 12,000 asylum seekers homeless on September 8</p>

<p>Six Afghan youths are on trial for arson in connection to the fire. They deny the charges.</p>

<p>The Moria camp was notorious for overcrowding, poor sanitation and ethnic gang violence.</p>

<p>Also Monday, Greek police said they had identified 33 aid workers who allegedly facilitated illegal migration to Lesbos.</p>

<p>A Greek police source later said the 'preliminary' investigation was still under way.</p>

<p>A police statement said the suspects, who worked for four non-governmental organisations, were part of 'an organised network' created to 'systematically' facilitate illegal migration to the island.</p>

<p>Two other foreign nationals - identified by state TV ERT as an Afghan and an Iranian - were also part of the alleged operation, the police said.</p>

<p>No information was given on the aid groups in question, the identities of the suspects, or whether any were already in custody. </p>

<p>Police said the alleged operation was active from at least June, 'providing substantial assistance to organised migrant-smuggling networks' by helping direct migrant boats to shore safely.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Germany has offered to take 1,500 asylum seekers from Greece, including former Moria residents.</p>

<p>For its part France has offered to take in 500 minors from the camp.</p>

<p>Authorities and local residents on Lesbos had long campaigned for the immediate removal of most of the asylum seekers.</p>

<p>After the camp burned down, a makeshift tent facility was hurriedly erected to house some 9,500 people.</p>

<p>But the temporary camp, on a hill overlooking the sea, is ill-equipped to handle winter conditions.</p>

<p>The government is now in talks to build a smaller permanent camp on the island. </p>
