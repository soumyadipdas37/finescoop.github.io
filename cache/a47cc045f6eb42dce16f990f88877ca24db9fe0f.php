<p>The Mayor of London and members of his security team mounted £3,000 electric bikes which were delivered to his house in a VW transit van this morning. </p>

<p>Some of his protection detail tailed them in the 4x4 on their journey from Tooting to City Hall on the south bank of the Thames.  </p>

<p>Today is Car Free Day in the capital and Londoners are encouraged to ditch their vehicles and commute by more environmentally friendly means.</p>

<p>Santander bikes are free to hire today, but Mr Khan opted for a state-of-the-art e-bike that retails at £2,700.</p>

<p>Bag slung over his shoulder, the suited Mr Khan pushed off from outside his south London home with two protection guards wearing bright clothing and riding slightly chunkier Tern Vektron bikes which cost £3,000. </p>

<p>The riders were followed by one of the V8-engine Range Rovers Mr Khan regularly uses to travel to work.</p>

<p>It is understood to be a Range Rover Sentinel, Land Rover's protection vehicle which is kitted with armoured glass, under-floor blast protection, spike-proof tyres and an emergency escape system. </p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police provide round-the-clock protection for Mr Khan, who is unlikely to be able to refuse their heavy security measures. </p>

<p>The nature of the job often makes it difficult for high-profile politicians to avoid needing a car.</p>

<p>David Cameron memorably was tailed by a car carrying his briefing documents while he cycled as part of a publicity drive to showboat his green credentials.</p>

<p>Pollution is one of the key issues blighting the capital and Mr Khan used Car Free Day to launch his new School Streets new air quality campaign.</p>

<p>It is understood to be a Range Rover Sentinel, Land Rover's protection vehicle which is kitted with armoured glass, under-floor blast protection, spike-proof tyres and an emergency escape system</p>

<p>Thirty cutting-edge sensors will monitor levels of nitrogen dioxide at 18 primary schools across Brent, Enfield and Lambeth. </p>

<p>TfL has funded 430 new School Streets, where roads surrounding schools are closed to traffic at drop-off and pick-up times.</p>

<p>Launching the project, Mr Khan said: 'I'm delighted that we are launching our School Streets air quality monitoring project on Car Free Day. </p>

<p>'It is vital that we don't throw away the improvements made to air quality during lockdown and the past few months with a damaging car-based recovery from this pandemic.</p>

<p>'The 430 new School Streets which have been funded as part of our world-leading Streetspace plan will play an important role in enabling parents and children to walk, cycle or scoot to and from school which has so many benefits, not least in improving air quality. </p>

<p>'Too many lives are already lost each year as a result of our city's toxic air and the results of our monitoring study will show just how much of a difference reducing car journeys through School Streets makes.'  </p>
