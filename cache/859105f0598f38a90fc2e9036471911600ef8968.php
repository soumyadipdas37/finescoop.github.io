<p>Cover girl: Julianne Moore graces the cover of DuJour Magazine's fall print issue and got candid in the interview about her upcoming role as feminist icon Gloria Steinem</p>

<p>Julianne is set to portray Steinem in the upcoming Julie Taymor biopic, The Glorias, which starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video/VOD on September 30.  </p>

<p>'It was intimidating,' Moore revealed about her first meeting with Steinem. 'She's such a magnificent and formidable woman and the definition of an activist.'  </p>

<p>The Oscar winner will portray the activist in the film after age 40 and actress Alicia Vikander, 31, will take on the character from ages 20–40.</p>

<p>Steinem was on hand throughout the production of the film and diplomatically stepped in to make sure the acting was true to form. </p>

<p>'It was intimidating,' Moore revealed about her first meeting with Steinem. 'She's such a magnificent and formidable woman and the definition of an activist.'</p>

<p>'She'll gently correct you,' Julianne said, 'but she's so modest.'    </p>

<p>'As an actress, it was a challenge to portray her, because her mannerisms and her vocal quality are so subtle,' the Magnolia star said. 'Watching her speeches and interviews, I'm so aware of how much abuse was inflicted on her. But she's never rash and doesn't yell. She never took the bait.'</p>

<p>The trailer - which dropped earlier in September - showed the actresses in character with Steinem's iconic long blonde hair. In the film the different aged versions (there are four in all) are able to interact with each other.</p>

<p>'As an actress, it was a challenge to portray her, because her mannerisms and her vocal quality are so subtle,' the Magnolia star said.</p>

<p>'The fantastical element of the film was so appealing to me. She cinematically encompasses who this person was to all of us,' Moore said. </p>

<p>The legendary Bette Midler took on the role of New York Congresswoman Bella Abzug, who co-founded the National Women's Political Caucus with Gloria.</p>

<p>Orange Is the New Black scene stealer Lorraine Toussaint portrays lawyer Florynce 'Flo' Kennedy, who also helped found the National Women's Political Caucus.</p>

<p>R&amp;B songstress Janelle Monáe (Harriet, Hidden Figures) plays the co-founder of Ms. magazine, Dorothy Pitman Hughes. </p>

<p>Oscar winner: Julianne posed for a casual yet chic cover shoot for the magazine - ditching her blonde tresses from The Glorias and embracing her classic fiery red shade</p>

<p>'You never walk into a trailer and see the kind of diversity that we had on set. So many women are represented in the film and that sense of Gloria being about all women,' Julianne reflected. </p>

<p>Adding: 'The film is a real reminder on whose shoulders we stand and the rights we take for granted now—like birth control.' </p>

<p>Since March, she has been living the good life in quarantine with her husband and daughter in The Hamptons.</p>

<p>'We felt so lucky to have it,' she said of her Montauk residence. 'It was so, so cold in the winter, but amazing.' </p>

<p>'It's always wonderful to be with your family,' Julianne mused about this unprecedented situation. 'My husband cooks and I clean - but we're both so sick of the endless loads of laundry and dishes.'</p>

<p>'It's been a lesson for all of us,' she reflected on the pandemic. 'Trying to go forward as if nothing has changed is a bit of a fool's errand. We just have to accept that we don't know what's happening with anything.' </p>

<p>Coming soon: The Glorias, which starts streaming on Amazon Prime Video/VOD on September 30</p>
