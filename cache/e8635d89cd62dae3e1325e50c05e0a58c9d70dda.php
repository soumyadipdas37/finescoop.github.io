<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victorians might be spending less time outside due to COVID-19 restrictions but health authorities are still urging residents to be wary of deadly thunderstorm asthma.</p>

<p>Ten people died during or soon after a thunderstorm asthma event in Melbourne on November 21, 2016.</p>

<p>Victoria's deputy chief health officer Allen Cheng warned about the freak storm, which prompted an inquest, in a message to the public on Thursday.</p>

<p>A combination of high pollen levels and strong winds can trigger the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Victorian health authorities have issued a warning for residents to we wary of thunderstorm asthma events in months to come - four years after a storm in Melbourne (pictured) killed ten people</p>

<p>November is usually the peak period for the asthma event, but Dr Cheng said it could take place any time from October to December.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Meteorology confirmed a La Nina over the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday, meaning Australia is likely to have a rainy spring and summer.</p>

<p>There is the possibility of flooding and more severe tropical cyclones than usual.</p>

<p>'This is likely to mean that it is somewhat of a high risk of thunderstorms, although the pollen forecast at this stage is only that it is probably going to be moderate,' Dr Cheng told reporters.</p>

<p>Current, former or undiagnosed asthmatics and hay fever sufferers should stay indoors when high-risk epidemic thunderstorm asthma events happen, or they should have good control of their condition.</p>

<p>'If you are in any one of those groups, you should see your GP and make sure that you have an action plan in case something happens,' Dr Cheng said.</p>

<p>'There have been a lot of changes to recommendations about medications over the last year.</p>

<p>'Even if you have seen your GP, but haven't seen them for a little while, it may be worth going back to make sure the medication you are on is appropriate.'</p>

<p>Dr Cheng said concerned Victorians could check pollen count meters on the VicEmergency app and University of Melbourne website.</p>

<p>He assured the community that systems were ready to issue high pollen warnings and monitor hospital admissions for signs of epidemic thunderstorm asthma.</p>
