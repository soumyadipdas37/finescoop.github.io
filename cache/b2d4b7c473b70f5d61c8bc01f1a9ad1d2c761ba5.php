<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new mum and CEO of fashion brand Showpo was asked by a nurse if she was 'checking in or out' of the hospital after giving birth to her son.</p>

<p>Jane Lu, 34, who lives in Sydney, welcomed Lachlan James Waldie into the world on August 14, 2020, after what she described as a 'tough' labour.</p>

<p>When she was checking out with him and her husband James Waldie, one of the nurses asked if she was actually preparing to 'check in'.  </p>

<p>'When we were checking out of the hospital, the lady asked me 'are you checking in or checking out?'' Jane captioned a recent Instagram post.</p>

<p>Jane Lu, 34, who lives in Sydney, welcomed Lachlan James Waldie into the world on August 14, 2020, after what she described as a 'tough' labour (one day after birth)</p>

<p>When she was checking out with him and her husband James Waldie, one of the nurses asked if she was actually preparing to 'check in'</p>

<p>'No one ever tells you what your body will look like after giving birth. This is me at the hospital the next day, a bit surprised that I still looked pregnant. I know, so dumb, what was I expecting?'</p>

<p>In the corresponding photo Jane had her hair tied up in a high ponytail, was wearing a white business shirt and colourful pyjama bottoms. </p>

<p>'Six weeks later and I'm the heaviest I've ever been (bar the actual pregnancy), and two clothes sizes bigger, but am just completely loving my body for what incredible things it can do and the incredible journey it's been on the last 10 months,' she said.</p>

<p>'Also, hello boobs! Where have you been my whole life!'</p>

<p>Many of her fans were quick to offer words of support to the new mother, saying that women should never expect to be 'the same person' after having a child (pictured at 39 weeks pregnant)</p>

<p>'Girl I'm still my heaviest nearly two years after baby two. The body changes. The shapes change. The hormones change. You've made that beautiful little man. As if we'd ever be the same?!' One woman said</p>

<p>'YESSSS. Love this so much! I wish we saw more instant post birth bellies so we all knew how normal it is! So hard not to be AMAZED by our bodies after bringing babies into the world,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'You look beautiful Jane! So many people post pictures of them looking back in shape. Unrealistic expectations for many. Look after yourself'. </p>

<p>Head of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at the Women's at Sandringham Dr Penny Sheehan told Huffington Post Australia that women gain an extra half of your normal blood volume during pregnancy.</p>

<p>A third added: 'You look beautiful Jane! So many people post pictures of them looking back in shape. Unrealistic expectations for many. Look after yourself' (pictured a year before getting pregnant)</p>

<p>Ultimately Dr Sheehan believes it's unrealistic for women to believe their bodies will revert back immediately after delivery, and the people around them during this time should acknowledge this</p>

<p>This extra fluid doesn't immediately dissipate after you have a child, not even if you lose blood during the delivery of the baby and placenta.  </p>

<p>'You might have nasty swelling from the fluid a few days after the birth, which might freak you out, but it's normal,' she told the publication.</p>

<p>'Your tummy also takes time to go down. In that six week postpartum period, it takes at least that for the stretched tissue to start to regain its elasticity and come back to its normal size.</p>

<p>'It also takes at least six weeks for your uterus to shrink back down. It will be half the size it was after delivering the baby, but it still has extra shrinking to do, and that takes a few weeks. You can't expect your tummy to just go back to being flat.' </p>

<p>During pregnancy a women's skeleton will also change and her ribs will protrude more than they used to, a change that doesn't reverse itself post-birth. </p>

<p>Ultimately Dr Sheehan believes it's unrealistic for women to believe their bodies will revert back immediately after delivery, and the people around them during this time should acknowledge this. </p>
