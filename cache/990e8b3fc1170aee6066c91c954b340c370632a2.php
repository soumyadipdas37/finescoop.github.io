<p>Lights, camera, action! The boys certainly pulled it out of the bag when it counted on Sunday's episode of The All New Monty: Guys and Gals</p>

<p>Tom Derickx, Adam Dovile, Orpheus Pledger, Wayne Carey, Samuel Johnson, Michael Slater, Shannan Ponton and Paul Fenech practised rigorously throughout the episode to nail their routine.</p>

<p>And choreographer Todd McKenney certainly had his work cut out for him as he struggled to get the boys to flawlessly execute their dance moves in rehearsals.</p>

<p>Attempting to ease their nerves, Todd took the performers to the salon to get a wax and a spray-tan.</p>

<p>Once primped and preened, it was time for the boys to hit the stage and perform for a packed out theatre.</p>

<p>Good cause: The celebrity line-up showed off their fancy footwork while stripping naked in a bid to raise awareness for prostate and testicular cancer during their final performance on the Channel Seven charity special</p>

<p>Where to look? With the boys' clothes dropping by the second, audience members could not contain themselves as they screamed, danced and clapped in support from their seats</p>

<p>Despite the less than promising rehearsal, the final performance went without a hitch with everyone hitting their marks at the perfect time.</p>

<p>While many sported evident nerves about stripping off earlier in the episode, they oozed confidence as a bevvy of glamorous back-up dancers ripped their white shirts from their bronzed torsos.</p>

<p>Not done there with the racy displays, the boys cheekily stripped off their trousers to reveal their silver G-Strings.</p>

<p>With the screams in the audience getting louder, the boys let the audience members in for one final treat as they ripped off their barely there underwear.</p>

<p>The boys clearly had adrenaline rushing through their veins as they rushed off stage in excitement.</p>

<p>Perfection: Despite the less than promising rehearsal, the final performance went without a hitch with everyone hitting their marks at the perfect time</p>

<p>Work it! While many sported evident nerves about stripping off earlier in the episode, they oozed confidence as a bevvy of back-up dancers ripped their white shirts from their bronzed torsos</p>

<p>Barely there: Not done there with the racy displays, the boys cheekily stripped off their trousers to reveal their silver G-Strings</p>

<p>Backstage, Adam gushed: 'My heart was beating out of my chest! It gave me goosebumps, that was amazing!'</p>

<p>Choreographer Todd told the men: 'Talk about pulling it out of the bag when it counted. Like, that was seriously the best you've done it!'</p>

<p>Earlier in the episode, the girls came together for the first time to discuss their nerves about stripping naked and discuss their personal experiences with breast cancer.</p>

<p>The All New Monty: Guys and Gals continues Sunday at 7pm on Channel Seven.</p>

<p>The whole package: With the screams in the audience getting louder, the boys let the audience members in for one final treat as they ripped off their barely there underwear</p>
