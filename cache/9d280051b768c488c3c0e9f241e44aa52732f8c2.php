<p>After a month of 'crying, screaming and sobbing', Ruth said Eamonn told her she had 'so much to live for.'</p>

<p>Ruth explained: 'Eamonn pointed out that he was, in effect, losing not one, but two of the most precious people in his life – Julia and me. He showed me how I had so much to live for in Julia's memory – and beyond.'</p>

<p>'He pleaded with me not to let it win, by ruining everything I had achieved – and still had to celebrate.'</p>

<p>She added: 'You are left with the 'what ifs'. It's her family now that I think will need so much help.'   </p>

<p>Sharing a photo alongside Julia in June last year, Ruth told her Instagram followers at the time of her sister's tragic death: 'My lovely Sis Julia has sadly died after a very long illness. My heart is completely broken.'</p>
