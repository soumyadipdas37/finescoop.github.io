<p>The analysis claims areas in north-west England where local lockdowns have been put in force - including Bolton, Manchester and Rochdale - 'never really left the epidemic phase'.</p>

<p>An epidemic refers to a disease infecting a large group of people whereas endemic is generally when a bug is constantly affecting a particular region.</p>

<p>Parts of northern England could be in the midst of a coronavirus endemic, according to leaked Public Health England documents. Pictured: Members of the public wear masks as they walk through Bolton town centre on Tuesday</p>

<p>The analysis claims areas in north-west England where local lockdowns have been put in force - including Bolton (people pictured in Bolton this week), Manchester and Rochdale - 'never really left the epidemic phase'</p>

<p> It claims 90 per cent of Greater Manchester boroughs are 'currently experiencing an epidemic phase'. Pictured: People in Bolton this week</p>

<p>The paper - marked 'official sensitive' and seen by The Observer - looked at areas with a high amount of Covid-19 cases and examined links between large caseloads, economic deprivation, over-crowded housing and larger BAME communitites.</p>

<p>It suggests coronavirus is solidly in place in various areas meaning local lockdowns will hardly make any difference.</p>

<p>While the document - which uses data up until August - does focus on northwestern regions which have been put back into partial lockdowns following a spike in coronavirus cases - it implies the its findings could be used on a national level.</p>

<p>It reads: 'The overall analysis suggests Bolton, Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale never really left the epidemic phase - and that nine of the 10 boroughs [of Greater Manchester] are currently experiencing an epidemic phase.'</p>

<p>The new measures, which were announced on Saturday evening, will come into effect immediately. Pictured: Bolton town centre at the start of September</p>

<p>People should only use public transport to travel to education, work or for essential appointments in Bolton. Pictured: a trace testing centre on Thursday</p>

<p>It adds: 'If we accept the premise that in some areas the infection is now endemic - how does this change our strategy? </p>

<p>'If these areas were not able to attain near-zero-Covid status during full lockdown, how realistic is it that we can expect current restriction escalations to work?' </p>

<p>Bolton was last night placed under tighter Covid-19 restrictions as the infection rate in the area becomes the highest in England with hundreds of thousands of people banned from mixing.</p>

<p>Bolton Council has asked for people in the town to avoid mixing with other households and to only use public transport for essential purposes.</p>

<p>It comes as the town's infection rate recently increased to 99 cases per 100,000 people per week, the highest in England, the council said.</p>

<p>Glasgow locals have slammed their local lockdown as confusing after rules state they can't meet at each other's homes but can go out for a meal together.</p>

<p>Under the guidelines - which also apply to West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire - residents are no longer allowed to meet up with other households indoors from midnight on Tuesday.</p>

<p> But restaurants, pubs and bars have all stayed open causing confusion among locals.</p>

<p>Helen Smith, 45, told The Observer: 'I’ve followed all the rules since the start of this thing but I can’t get my head round these latest ones</p>

<p>'We were told to avoid pubs and restaurants and large groups of different households.</p>

<p>'Now I can meet my own family in a pub or a gym with loads of other people but I can’t privately go round to their house.'</p>

<p>It came after the NHS regional board of Greater Glasgow and Clyde reported 66 cases of coronavirus in 24 hours - 43 per cent of Scotland's total cases on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Officials say the spike appears to be mostly traced back to indoor gatherings, leading to the limited rules.</p>

<p>Just days earlier, Boris Johnson came under fire for 'mess after mess' in the coronavirus crisis after the government performed another embarrassing U-turn on lockdowns.</p>

<p>Bolton and Trafford were among a series of areas in the North West due to see restrictions eased on Wednesday.</p>

<p>But the move was abandoned at the 11th hour after a furious backlash from local politicians including Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, who said infection levels were still far too high.</p>

<p>Councillors from both Bolton and Trafford warned of a spike in coronavirus cases - but a lockdown was not put in place until 12 hours after most locals understood that it was lifted. </p>

<p>Local leaders have repeatedly felt exasperated by the national government throughout the pandemic as confusing 11th-hour rules have left constituents seeking clarity.</p>

<p>Many councils have used volunteers or staff to take on community-lead virus control, focused on communication, the paper reports.</p>

<p>Public health directors have slammed the current approach - where rules and guidance on local lockdowns comes from London - as making their job even more difficult.  </p>

<p>New lockdown rules were also enforced in Glasgow from midnight on Tuesday following a spike in coronavirus cases there.</p>

<p>Under the guidelines - which also apply to West Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire - residents are no longer allowed to meet up with other households indoors.</p>

<p>Only essential hospital visits are permitted in the affected areas and anyone visiting a loved one in a care home must do so outside.</p>

<p>The rules will be reviewed after a week but they are set to remain in place for 14 days in total. </p>

<p>It comes after the NHS regional board of Greater Glasgow and Clyde reported 66 cases of coronavirus in 24 hours - 43 per cent of Scotland's total cases on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Addressing the restrictions, Ms Sturgeon wrote on Twitter: 'I know how difficult this will be - I am a Glasgow resident so these rules apply to me too - but they are essential to, I hope, nip this in bud and avoid tougher restrictions.'</p>

<p>The additional regulations in the three areas come after Aberdeen was thrust into lockdown again on August 5.</p>

<p>The city's population of more than 200,000 were banned from travelling more than five miles from their homes and pubs, bars and restaurants were shut.</p>

<p>The lockdown rules were then relaxed 18 days later.</p>
