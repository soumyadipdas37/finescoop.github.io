<p>Meghan Markle (left with Prince Harry) met Jameela Jamil (right with boyfriend James Blake on a Montecito beach on Wednesday) at the couple's sprawling California mansion just one day after the former Radio 1 DJ dubbed Prince Andrew a pedophile on Twitter, a source claimed</p>

<p>The Good Place star, 34, said the Duke of York - Prince Harry's uncle - was the Firm's 'alleged resident pedo' and claimed he was 'besties with a sex trafficker' in a Twitter rant (pictured) on August 22</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Jameela and James drove up to Montecito from Los Angeles and spent time with Meghan and Harry.</p>

<p>'They also had a stroll on the beach but Meghan and Harry didn’t venture out with them.' </p>

<p>Jamil and Blake were pictured taking a stroll on a beach in Montecito - just a short distance away from Meghan and Harry's new home - on August 22, one day prior to their supposed visit and the same day as the tweet.</p>

<p>Jamil stood up for Meghan amid claims the Suits actress went against royal family rules by being political. </p>

<p>The former T4 star wrote: 'I <em>THINK</em> they may be more embarrassed by their alleged resident pedo Andrew who was besties with a sex trafficker, than an American supporting women voting in her own country, and loosely referencing the importance of general democracy which is being threatened here currently.'</p>

<p>A Twitter user replied to Jamil's post by saying: 'Plus didn't they step back from the monarchy? Why does everyone wanna hate her so much, its so sad and disgusting.'</p>

<p>Jamil responded: 'Because she’s not white. And because she’s smart, strong, opinionated, rebellious, beautiful, happy and has everything they never will. </p>

<p>'She’s a terrifying threat to patriarchy because she doesn’t fit the stereotype for women. They discredit her because they can’t kill her.'</p>

<p>Virginia Roberts - now known as Virginia Giuffre - says she was trafficked by pedophile financier Epstein and alleges the duke had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was 17.</p>

<p>Andrew has categorically denied he has had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Giuffre.  </p>
