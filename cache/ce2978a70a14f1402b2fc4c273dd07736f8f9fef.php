<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The head of the NHS in England has hit out at drugs firms which try to ‘price-gouge’ taxpayers.</p>

<p>Sir Simon Stevens claimed one company was attempting to raise the cost of a medicine for mental health disorders by 2,600 per cent.</p>

<p>The firm, Essential Pharma, raised the costs of lithium carbonate tablets from £3 to £87 in 2016.</p>

<p>They have since withdrawn one of their other products which means the NHS may be forced to switch to this more expensive version.</p>

<p>Sir Simon called for it to be made illegal for ‘bad apple’ companies to hike their prices arbitrarily. </p>

<p>Sir Simon Stevens claimed Essential Pharma was attempting to raise the cost of a medicine for mental health disorders by 2,600 per cent</p>

<p>He also claimed up to 50,000 patients could be affected by the move.</p>

<p>Essential Pharma owns the rights to two other brands of lithium carbonate and the costs to the NHS for the drug are now likely to rise from £2million to £17million.</p>

<p>The tablets are used to treat bipolar disorder and depression and the health service could be forced to ration them or switch to less effective alternatives if it cannot negotiate a lower price.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Health Service Journal’s virtual Integrated Care Summit yesterday, Sir Steven explained how the NHS frequently negotiated with drug firms to lower their fees.</p>

<p> He added: ‘You do occasionally get the one bad apple – which isn’t the same as the whole barrel. </p>

<p>'There is a case, unfortunately going on right now, where we have a company, Essential Pharma, who are trying to jack the prices of a longstanding medicine for people particularly with bipolar disorder.</p>

<p>‘This is them just using the cover of coronavirus to try and price gouge British taxpayers, in a way which is also introducing clinical risk for vulnerable patients, and it is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>‘So I hope where we find those isolated examples... we can take action. </p>

<p>'If there needs to be a change of the law to make that happen perhaps that is something that could be included in the forthcoming NHS bill.’</p>

<p>Essential Pharma, raised the costs of lithium carbonate tablets from £3 to £87 in 2016</p>

<p>An Essential Pharma spokesman said: ‘We have sought to minimise disruption to patients and to allow time for the transfer to suitable alternative lithium products by providing an extended notice period of such discontinuance.’</p>

<p>Mental health experts say lithium carbonate is the ‘gold standard’ treatment and patients should ideally keep taking it.</p>

<p>Scientists believe that it helps strengthen nerve cell connections in the regions of the brain responsible for regulating mood, thinking and behaviour.</p>

<p>Essential Pharma owns one of the most widely-used brands of lithium carbonate which currently costs £4.02 for a pack of 100 tablets.</p>

<p>But the company – owned by a Swiss private equity firm – recently said ‘restrictions on permitted pricing’ of this brand, Priadel, meant it was ‘no longer viable.’</p>

<p>They held talks with health officials to negotiate a higher price but chose to pull the brand altogether. </p>

<p>Supplies will likely run out by April. Patients will likely be switched to other brands of lithium carbonate, such as the one Essential Pharma raised the price of in 2016.</p>
