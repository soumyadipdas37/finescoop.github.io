<p>The 94-year-old monarch was seen cruising alone on the public roads of the Sandringham estate.</p>

<p>Last month she and husband Prince Philip, 99, cut short their summer holiday at Balmoral by three weeks to spend some time together at Wood Farm, where the Duke of Edinburgh now lives alone in a 'modest' five-bedroom home. </p>

<p>Donning a pair of sunglasses and a head scarf adorned with butterflies, the Queen looked deep in thought as she drove down the tree-lined roads.</p>

<p>Her Majesty is expected to head back to 'HMS Bubble' at Windsor next week, with reports claiming Philip is 'being made' to return to the castle because there is not enough staff to create two anti-Covid-19 bubbles.</p>

<p>Palace officials are in the process of creating a special 'bubble' between Sandringham and Windsor, which means the Queen can travel between the two with the same team. </p>

<p>Earlier this week the monarch was said to be 'furious' when employees of the Royal Household revolted against a plan for them to stay in a coronavirus bubble at Sandringham over Christmas.   </p>

<p>A team of about 20 staff members had been asked to remain at the 20,000 acre property without their families to support her, Prince Philip and other members of the Royal Family during the festive period.</p>

<p>But the group – said to involve cleaners, laundry and maintenance workers - are believed to have mutinied because they are unwilling to isolate from loved ones for four weeks. </p>

<p>Staff were being asked to stay for the month-long period so they could remain in a Covid bubble to protect the 94-year-old monarch.</p>

<p>The uprising means the Queen could be forced to spend Christmas at Windsor Castle for the first time in 33 years. </p>

<p>Last month it was revealed Her Majesty will receive a bailout from the taxpayer after her land and property investments plummeted in value due to the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>The Treasury said that it will top up the Sovereign Grant to help maintain her income, which is severely threatened by the pandemic.</p>

<p>The monarch's income is based on a 25 per cent share of the profits of the Crown Estate, which owns valuable land in London and elsewhere. </p>

<p>Mid-September, the estate announced its profits would fall 'significantly' this year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
