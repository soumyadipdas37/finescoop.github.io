<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hudson Yards, known as the most expensive real estate project in American history, lays all but abandoned amid the country's coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>The $25 billion complex, located on Manhattan's West Side, was once touted as the most exciting new attraction in New York City. </p>

<p>But just 18 months after its initial opening - and four years out from its expected completion date - the 18 million square foot development resembles a ghost town. </p>

<p>Photographs taken by DailyMail.com on Thursday show Hudson Yards' desolate parks, shuttered offices, and empty shops - images that cast doubt on the future of the retail, commercial and residential hub. </p>

<p>It's a far cry from the initial aspirations of developers, who boasted back in 2018 that Hudson Yards could become the 'center of gravity' in New York City.  </p>

<p>The development was initially imagined as an oasis for the rich, with luxury apartments and a one million square foot shopping mall full of high-end stores. </p>

<p>It was hoped Hudson Yards could contribute nearly $19 billion annually to the Big Apple's economy, according to a report in Business Insider.  </p>

<p>But as wealthy residents flee the city amid the ongoing pandemic and a shocking spike in violent crime, swanky apartments are staying vacant and luxury retailers are struggling to draw in customers. </p>

<p>Photos from inside the Hudson Yards shopping mall show that stores such as Rolex, Cartier and Fendi are eerily quiet, despite having reopened to the public.  </p>

<p>Hudson Yards features a one million square foot shopping mall full of high-end stores. However, as wealthy residents have fled the city amid the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the retailers are struggling to draw in customers</p>

<p>The mall is surrounded by brand new office buildings, many of which are currently unoccupied as a majority of white-collar workers continue to  do their jobs remotely </p>

<p>There was barely a soul in sight at the Hudson Yards shopping mall on Thursday. Some stores, including Louis Vuitton, remain shuttered </p>

<p>Designer store Fendi looked almost empty, as did a men's clothing store located on the level above </p>

<p>On Thursday, luxury retailer Louis Vuitton was closed and it's expensive products had been removed from display</p>

<p>Some franchises, however, remained shuttered during DailyMail.com's visit on Thursday. </p>

<p>Upscale department store Neiman Marcus has not reopened since the pandemic upended American life back in March. The business filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and the future of its Hudson Yards' store remains unseen. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, luxury retailer Louis Vuitton was also closed, and it's expensive products removed from display behind barred doors. </p>

<p>Some eateries have also refused to reopen, with Jack's Stir Fry and Shake Shack both darkened during the lunch time rush. </p>

<p>Both outlets were popular spots for workers employed in Hudson Yards' plush new office buildings. </p>

<p>However, most of those buildings are now empty, with a majority of white collar workers still doing their jobs remotely.  </p>

<p>Hudson Yards also briefly became a tourist hot spot, with many visitors from across the world flocking to see The Vessel. </p>

<p>People lined up for hours to climb the interactive sculpture and snap a selfie, at the hot new attraction. </p>

<p>But on Thursday, The Vessel was almost empty as the number of tourists to New York City remains at near historic lows. </p>

<p>According to The Gothamist, around $3.3 billion of taxpayer money was used to help construct Hudson Yards. It used to cover the cost of new roads and parks, as well as a subway extension. </p>

<p>However, the Hudson Yards subway station was also eerily empty on Thursday, and the future of the development now remains in doubt before it has even been completed. </p>
