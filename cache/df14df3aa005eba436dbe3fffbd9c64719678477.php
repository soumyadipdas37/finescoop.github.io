<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale looks set for the chop at Real Madrid this summer and fans reckon his hair could do with one as well.</p>

<p>The Madrid star shocked fans as he showed off his mane of hair during Wednesday's training session with Wales.</p>

<p>Bale is away on international duty and has trained with the squad this week ahead of their Nations League matches with Finland and Bulgaria.</p>

<p>Fans were knocked for six after pictures emerged showing how long Gareth Bale's hair has got</p>

<p>The Wales star took down his man bun and showed off his locks in training on Wednesday</p>

<p>During Wednesday's session, Bale was snapped taking his hair down from his trademark man bun revealing the full extent of his flowing locks - which is a rare occurrence in front of the cameras.</p>

<p>Bale has become an outcast at Madrid, having only made five appearances since the turn of the year and one fan joked his overgrown barnet may be the reason Zinedine Zidane is not playing him.</p>

<p>Hundreds of other fans took to social media to express their surprise at just how long and out of control Bale's hair has gotten.</p>

<p>A tweet from Paddy Power's account said: 'I don't care what people say; I think Gareth Bale is an inspired choice to play Scar in the new Lion King sequel.'</p>

<p>Others were quick to poke fun at Bale's appearance by joking he could feature in the Disney favourite. </p>

<p>Bale has donned the long-hair look for some time and was seen placing his hands on the side of Jonny Williams' head on Wednesday as he shared a joke with his team-mate - who has not been as fortunate as him in the hair department.</p>

<p>The former Tottenham forward has established himself as a reliable star performer for Wales but his time in the Spanish capital has turned sour over the last few years.</p>

<p>He spent much of last season either out of the squad or sitting on the bench and the club are desperate to get him off their wage bill after a deal to move to the Chinese Super League in January never came to fruition.</p>

<p>Bale appeared to joke with Jonny Williams - who isn't as fortunate as him in hair department</p>

<p>He spent much of last season at Real Madrid on the sidelines and could be sold this summer</p>

<p>However, Bale's departure from Madrid is likely to be frustrated by the club's reluctance to pay off the remaining two years of his salary.</p>

<p>Bale's €17million (£15.1m) salary over his remaining two years would mean Madrid would have to negotiate a possible €34m (£30.2m) pay-off which they are not in a position to do.</p>

<p>Marca suggested a meeting between Bale's representatives Stellar Group has already been set up but Sportsmail understands there is still no imminent meeting planned.</p>

<p>The coming together will not be instigated by Bale whose agent Jonathan Barnett has repeated the player's intention to honour the two years remaining on his contract despite being frozen out by Madrid boss Zidane.</p>
