<p>'My body is definitely starting to feel stretched, especially after a big meal. I'm using body oil to keep my skin nice and stretchy (it also really relieves itchy nipples!).</p>

<p>Social distancing: Ashley reflected on the difficulties she has faced with the current coronavirus restrictions including not being able to see her family</p>

<p>'I took a break from training and reduced my length of walks, and that seems to have helped reduce the pain around my pelvis, so I'm ready to get back to training this week. </p>

<p>'Oh, I also got a birthing ball. Not being able to go see my family was a bit gutting, however we did a family zoom call and there's some other perks about the current lockdown (trying to look on the brightside): the 10pm curfew means I get to see my friends and still get to bed early,' accompanied by a winking emoji. </p>
