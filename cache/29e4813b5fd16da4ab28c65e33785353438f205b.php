<p>She has turned herself into a bona fide Hollywood star and has a swanky home in New York, so I was rather surprised to see Sienna Miller slumming it in London, sporting an ultra-fashionable pair of high-waisted baggy jeans, visiting an ordinary cafe – and not wearing her engagement ring.</p>

<p>Sienna, who had major roles in American Sniper and The Loudest Voice, stopped for coffee at a table outside a cafe in London with her mum Jo, sister Savannah and her ex, Tom Sturridge.</p>

<p>Is Sienna, 38, maybe a secret Madness fan? That might explain the baggy trousers, which she paired with a £450 yellow Frame Les Second Tote handbag.</p>

<p>She was pictured without her engagement ring, following reports in the US of a split from her toy boy fiance of nine months, Lucas Zwirner. She is said to have called off her engagement to Lucas, son of art dealer David Zwirner, a few weeks ago. The couple were first pictured together at the Met Gala in May 2019, and Lucas, 29, popped the question in January.</p>

<p>At least she had a shoulder to cry on in Tom, dad of her daughter Marlowe, eight.</p>

<p>My lips are sealed, but... </p>

<p>Which mega-rich family of ‘creatives’ is advertising for a French-speaking nanny/cook who can iron and walk two small dogs? </p>

<p>You won’t have to start until noon each day, will be paid £50,000 a year and will be provided with accommodation at the family’s Marylebone mansion.</p>

<p>Duties involve looking after the family’s baby daughter – and perks include holidays at their villa in Europe. Time to brush up on my Franglais!</p>
