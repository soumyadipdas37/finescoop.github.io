<p>For a limited time only, Amazon is offering a saving of £175.01 on their number one bestselling Philips Lumea Prestige IPL Cordless Hair Removal Device </p>

<p>The Philips Lumea Prestige IPL Cordless Hair Removal Device (BRI954/00) uses intense pulsed light (aka IPL) to stop hair growth. It can be used once every two weeks for full body hair removal, and it comes with different-sized treatment caps for the body, face, bikini and underarms helping you to target those hard-to-reach areas.</p>

<p>Not only significantly less painful than waxing, but it's also more convenient than shaving as you can treat both legs in just a few minutes.</p>

<p>'Absolute game-changer,' wrote one shopper. 'I have very thick hair. I used to have to shave every other day, but now I can go just over a week. I used to get really painful ingrowing hairs on my bikini line, and now it barely grows.</p>

<p>'I am on my 6th cycle. I do it every two weeks even though the app says I can now do it monthly; I am still doing every two weeks as I have found that I have missed areas. It has changed my life completely. Best money I have ever spent and I thought about it for a long time.'</p>

<p>'A week after using this and I'd already seen a reduction in hair growth, and it's getting less and less with each use,' said another in their five-star review. 'I'm honestly in disbelief as nothing has ever worked like this for me. I now live in shorts and skirts, having lived my whole life covering up my stubbly prickly legs!'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Have used this five times now, and while there is still minor regrowth, it is virtually invisible, and I can't even feel the stubble, up to five to six days after shaving. Legs lovely and smooth.'</p>

<p>The intelligent precision attachment is medium-sized with a 3 cm2 window for precise coverage of bikini and underarm areas</p>

<p>With continued use (two to three months), the hair follicle is killed and falls out, leaving you with silky, smooth skin. Philips recommends repeating the treatment once every couple of months to prevent hair from growing back.</p>

<p>According to Philips, you'll see up to 92 per cent of hair reduction within just three treatments.</p>

<p>It takes little effort. To use, place or slide the device on the areas you want to 'zap' by holding down the flash button. The device's sensor will identify which of the five power settings is right for your skin tone. And after the flash, you move on.</p>

<p>There's no denying the Philips Lumea Prestige IPL Cordless Hair Removal Device is expensive. But keep in mind a more expensive device will give better results.</p>

<p>Customers have hailed it 'a life-changer' claiming it's 'well worth the money' and gives 'great results'</p>

<p>Plus it saves you time, as you can fit sessions around your lifestyle. Plus, it's far cheaper than salon visits in the long run, which cost anywhere up to £730 per fully body treatment.</p>

<p>In-salon IPL - although brilliant - can tedious and very painful. Speaking of which, you'll be pleased to the quick 'zaps' of light cause minimal discomfort.</p>

<p>As one Amazon customer wrote in their review: 'No pain for me on most areas at time of use, any time I felt a little zing I did as I was told and reduced the light intensity - It still works.'</p>
