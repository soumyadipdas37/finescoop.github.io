<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hundreds more serious criminals will be locked up for longer at a cost of around £1billion.</p>

<p>Sexual and violent offenders will serve at least two thirds of prison terms rather than half.</p>

<p>Under the sentencing reforms announced yesterday, whole-life orders will extend to child killers and those aged 18 to 20 convicted of terrorist killings.</p>

<p>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland (pictured) said the changes would result in a ‘fairer system’ that better protects the public</p>

<p>This is on top of previously-announced plans for the removal of early release for those with terms of more than seven years.</p>

<p>The sentencing white paper said these reforms could lead to 2,600 prisoners serving longer jail sentences by 2028.</p>

<p>Last night the Ministry of Justice admitted this would cost around £1billion – £385,000 per offender. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said the changes would result in a ‘fairer system’ that better protects the public.</p>

<p>The white paper also proposes 20-hour daily curfews for up to two years, community punishments and GPS tracking for burglars, robbers and thieves when they are released from prison.</p>

<p>Killer drivers – including those using their mobile phone at the wheel – will face tougher sentences. In a speech for the Centre for Social Justice, Mr Buckland said the public ‘expects child killers to feel the fullest and harshest extent of the law’.</p>

<p>He said the white paper was an ‘opportunity to grow trust and confidence in the sentencing system – in its ability to make the smart choices to protect the public from the harmful effects of crime, in whatever form they take’. </p>

<p>The announcement comes days after a parliamentary report warned prisons could run out of space to hold more criminals within the next three years, with some higher-risk inmates already having to be held in low-security jails.</p>

<p>Meanwhile courts in England and Wales are grappling with a backlog of more than half a million cases, with delays exacerbated by the pandemic.</p>

<p>At the same time, temporary laws are also being introduced to extend the custody time limit for people awaiting a trial for serious crimes.</p>

<p>The sentencing measures will also look at efforts to rehabilitate low-level criminals in a bid to reduce reoffending – such as cutting the time before a conviction is classed as ‘spent’ to help them find work. Mr Buckland said that sentencing failures left low-level offenders stuck in a life of crime and with little hope of turning things around.</p>

<p>He added: ‘Aside from the social impact, it is also a waste of money, with the cost of reoffending running into the billions every year. We need a new approach.’</p>

<p>David Lammy, Labour’s justice spokesman, urged the Government not to apply tougher sentences ‘gratuitously’ but said his party welcomed the reforms to ‘protect the British public’. </p>
