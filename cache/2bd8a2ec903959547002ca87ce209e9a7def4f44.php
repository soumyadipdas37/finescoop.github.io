<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Zara and Sam split towards the end of last month.</p>

<p>'They had been arguing a lot since moving in together as a result of lockdown and things just built up between them.</p>

<p>'Zara has moved back to her parents' house in Essex where she's taking some time for herself, she really loved Sam so this hasn't been easy for her.</p>

<p>'Sam has gone away to have a break from it all and clear his head away from Zara and social media.'</p>

<p>'Hasn't been easy': Love Island star Zara, 23, and Made In Chelsea's Sam, 28, called quits on their romance last month, just weeks after enjoying a loved up holiday in Mykonos </p>

<p>Protective?: The end of their relationship comes days after Sam's sister Louise, 30, posted a cryptic tweet about a friend 'cheating' and trust taking 'seconds to break' </p>

<p>Louise tweeted last Wednesday: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful,' which prompted fans to assume she had trouble in her own relationship with fiancé Ryan Libbey.</p>

<p>Days later she sparked further speculation by posting: 'Trust takes years to build, seconds to break, and forever to repair' followed by 'I'm proud of my heart. It's been played, stabbed, cheated, burned and broken… somehow still works.' </p>

<p>An insider told MailOnline: 'Things between Louise and Ryan are really great. Her tweet last week was actually aimed at a friend.'</p>

<p>Zara and Sam, who regularly post on Instagram and TikTok together, haven't shared any content as a couple since August. </p>

<p>Happy: Louise tweeted: 'Cheaters always want you to be loyal while they're being unfaithful,' which prompted fans to assume she had trouble in her own relationship with Ryan Libbey</p>

<p>About Sam and Zara?: But an insider told MailOnline: 'Things between Louise and Ryan are really great. Her tweet last week was actually aimed at a friend' </p>

<p>The couple went public with their romance in May 2019, four months after Zara's split from Love Island co-star Adam Collard.</p>

<p>Zara joined the cast of E4's Made In Chelsea, where she and Sam have been filmed having numerous arguments over his continued friendship with ex-girlfriend and co-star Tiffany Watson.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, the pair had words over Sam sharing a taxi home with Tiffany after a night out, leaving Zara to doubt the trust in their relationship.</p>

<p>Sam and Tiff split in 2017, which led to her exit from the reality show, before re-joining the cast as a single woman this year. </p>

<p>Trouble in paradise: Zara joined the cast of MIC, where she and Sam have been filmed having numerous arguments over his friendship with ex-girlfriend and co-star Tiffany Watson</p>

<p>Zara moved into Sam's west London home at the start of lockdown, and confessed to MailOnline that living together for the first time had put a strain on their relationship.</p>

<p>Speaking in July, Zara said: 'I have learnt more about Sam in the last couple of months than I have the whole of last year. Sam is quite a weird person.</p>

<p>'He needs his space but also likes attention and it's been hard to know when to give him his boy time and when to be a really attentive girlfriend.</p>

<p>'It hasn't been plain sailing for us like we have argued over the most stupid things. I would think 'Why am I arguing with Sam over who's unloading the dishwasher today?'</p>

<p>'Sometimes I will do the wrong thing and he'll do the wrong thing but it's part of being in a relationship.'</p>

<p>Zara, who launched her singing career on The X Factor: Celebrity last year, told MailOnline she believed her relationship with Sam would be long-lasting and had dreams of the pair marrying.</p>

<p>She said: 'I would not be with someone who I couldn't see myself being with forever. I know him well enough to know the way we work and being able to smile and laugh everyday is not something I've never had before. </p>

<p>'Sam teaches me not to take myself so seriously. He brings out all the good in me and that's all I want in a person.</p>

<p>'His sister Louise is like a sister to me now, we are super close and lockdown has bought us together so much.</p>

<p>'I don't know how we're going to have time apart now. I do love him so much – he's the sweetest thing.'  </p>

<p>'Hard': Zara moved into Sam's west London home at the start of lockdown, and confessed to MailOnline that living together for the first time had put a strain on their relationship </p>
