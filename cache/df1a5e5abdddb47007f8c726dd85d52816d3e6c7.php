<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Queensland has recorded four new coronavirus cases overnight with health officials urging more than three million people across the state to be on alert.</p>

<p>Three of the new cases are residents living at a Forest Lake home, in south-west Brisbane. The other case is a resident living at Collingwood Park at Ipswich.  </p>

<p>The state's Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young urged residents with symptoms to get tested, especially those in South East Queensland. </p>

<p>More than 3.5 million people live in the region, which stretches across the east coast and covers Brisbane, the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast.</p>

<p>'They might have been where one of our cases has been,' she said.</p>

<p>'Anyone who lives in that southeast corner should think of themselves as a casual contact.' </p>

<p>A casual contact is someone who has had brief face-to-face contact or been in the same closed space for less than two hours with a person who has coronavirus.</p>

<p>Queensland has recorded four new coronavirus cases overnight with top health officials urging more than three million people to get tested immediately (pictured, nurses at a drive-through COVID-19 pop-up clinic)</p>

<p>All of the new cases are connected to the cluster at Queensland's Corrective Services Academy in Wacol, with 11 cases linked to the cluster </p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on Friday Schoolies Week had been cancelled less than three months before it was scheduled to begin</p>

<p>Dr Jeanette Young went on to urge residents to wear face masks when visiting shopping centres.</p>

<p>'Over the last few days I've been saying to people this is the time to get out those ... surgical masks that you can now buy anywhere.</p>

<p>'Or if you've made a mask with three layers of thickness, they are effective as well — not quite as effective, but they're pretty good.' </p>

<p>All of the new cases are connected to the cluster at Queensland's Corrective Services Academy in Wacol, with 11 cases linked to the cluster. </p>

<p>A Brisbane childcare centre in Fig Tree pocket has also been closed for at least a week after receiving a COVID-19 positive visitor on August 21. </p>

<p>Queensland has extended its health restrictions, limiting the number of people who can gather at the Gold Coast and Darling Downs regions.</p>

<p>No more than ten people can gather in Brisbane, Ipswich and Logan without a COVID-19 safety plan, following an initial outbreak at a youth detention centre.</p>

<p>That will be extended south to the Gold Coast from 8am Saturday after two Pimpama residents linked to the cluster were diagnosed with the virus.</p>

<p>The new rules will also come in to effect in the Darling Downs from 8am on Monday, after health alerts were issues for The Southern Hotel and Queens' Park Markets in Toowoomba.</p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on Friday Schoolies Week had been cancelled less than three months before it was scheduled to begin.</p>

<p>'This is a mass event. It poses a high risk,' she told reporters.</p>

<p>Concerts and large parties will be banned, with limits on gatherings at beaches and apartment complexes.</p>

<p>'It's a tough year for everyone. Hopefully, things will get better by the end of next year and we can have a double celebration,' she said.</p>

<p>Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate said he backed the decision but conceded it would be tough on local businesses, such as accommodation providers.</p>

<p>'There will be costs in their business operations and I sympathise ... because to get new business in 85 days is near impossible,' he said.</p>

<p>Kimberley Brown (pictured), from Ballina, in northern New South Wales, was unable to obtain a travel exemption for urgent surgery in Queensland </p>

<p>Mr Tate said the event should have been cancelled sooner and called on tourism promoters to encourage families to the region, to replace the students. </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has also been criticised over the border closure after a mother lost one of her unborn twins and another one was separated from her newborn son.</p>

<p>Kimberley Brown, from Ballina, in northern New South Wales, was unable to obtain a travel exemption for urgent surgery in Queensland.</p>

<p>Her unborn twins had developed twin transfusion syndrome - a disorder that leads to malnourishment and organ failure in one of the babies. </p>

<p>Mrs Brown lived just two hours from Queensland's Mater Hospital but instead had to wait 16 hours for an emergency flight and travel 750km to Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.  </p>

<p>An ultrasound later showed Mrs Brown had lost one of the babies.  </p>

<p>Chantelle Northfield was also separated from her newborn son because of the border closure.</p>

<p>She had given birth to her son at Lismore Base Hospital, in New South Wales.</p>

<p>Chantelle Northfield (pictured) was also separated from her newborn son because of the border closure </p>

<p>Her son experienced difficulty breathing and was airlifted to Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital.</p>

<p>Ms Northfield remained in New South Wales and was unable to visit her baby without quarantining for 14 days.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke at a Bush Summit at Cooma on Friday to slam the border closure.  </p>

<p>'Much more needs to be done to ensure these border movements are made easier and ultimately to ensure they're open again,' he said.</p>

<p>'While the scale of the Victorian outbreak meant the borders between NSW and Vic were regrettably necessary — and they are and remain — this does not diminish the principle that border restrictions, especially where there are no or very low cases in regional areas, cannot and should not be sustained.</p>
