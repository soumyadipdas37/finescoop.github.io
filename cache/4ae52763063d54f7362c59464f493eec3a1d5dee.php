<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wedding DJ is urging Queensland's government to reconsider a bewildering double standard in its lockdown laws that ban dancing at receptions while allowing group sex parties with random strangers.</p>

<p>Nik Edser has created a petition to present to Queensland Health, pressuring the government body to review the blanket rule on dancing.</p>

<p>Currently, only the couple getting married and their parents can get on the dance floor. </p>

<p>'Currently swingers clubs have the dance floor roped off and closed to dancing due to the risks of spreading COVID-19,' Mr Edser said.</p>

<p>'If I was to attend a swingers club and met a woman, I would not be allowed to dance with her due to it being seen as high risk, yet in this very same establishment I could take her to a bedroom and have sex with her and this is not considered illegal.'</p>

<p>Nik Edser (pictured), a wedding entertainer, has created a petition to Queensland Health in order to review the blanket rule on dancing at weddings</p>

<p>Mr Edser told Daily Mail Australia he wants to make clear that he is not targeting the lifestyle of swingers.</p>

<p>'They should be able to continue doing what they're doing. I am targeting the discrepancy,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's the same with sport. I could go and sign up for a football match this weekend and a stranger could tackle me. The sporting field isn't going to magically stop the spread of the virus.'</p>

<p>He said he has had a lot of cancellations and postponements due to the Queensland Health regulations, and estimates it has cost him $15,000 worth of business.</p>

<p>'And even when people postpone, yes while we may still have that money but they will take a weekend next year where we could have had another wedding,' he said. </p>

<p>He said it's 'random' that people are unable to dance at weddings, but sex with strangers at swingers parties are still allowed (stock image)</p>

<p>Mr Edser added that wedding postponements also hurt caterers, florists, hire cars and many other wedding-centric businesses. </p>

<p>His petition does make allowances for social distancing, saying anyone not from the same household must stay 1.5 metres apart at all times on the dance floor, and numbers on the dance floor must be capped.</p>

<p>Mr Edser also suggested anyone drinking must stay seated, and no drinks brought to the dancing area. </p>

<p>Swingers clubs, and other sex-related industries, are regulated by Queensland's COVID Safe Industry Plan for Sex on Premises Venues and Adult Parties.</p>

<p>He said he has had a lot of cancellations and postponements because of the rules by Queensland Health. Mr Edser estimates he has lost $15,000 worth of business</p>

<p>However, they can only operate with an approved plan, and strict contact tracing regulations in place. </p>

<p>The parties are deemed high-risk but the documentation outlines mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>A Queensland Health spokesperson said planning for these types of events has been a 'unique challenge'.  </p>

<p>'Queensland’s COVID Safe Plans are our best system to balance the health response necessary to keep our community safe with keeping life as normal as possible,' the spokesperson said.</p>

<p>'Those operating under COVID Safe Industry Plans or COVID Safe Checklists are aware of their roles and responsibilities in conducting business during a pandemic to prevent any uncontrolled spread of COVID-19.' </p>
