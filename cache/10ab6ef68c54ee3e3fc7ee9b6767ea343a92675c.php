<p>Geppert (pictured with former girlfriend Allaina Vader) was released on bail in January for a spate of alleged violent incidents before taking to social media to say he was putting that life behind him</p>

<p>The alleged pursuit started after cops approached Geppert when they saw him standing by a car in Harpullia Court.</p>

<p>He was taken into custody and charged with the outstanding arrest warrant before being refused bail. </p>

<p>Geppert is already serving a three-year suspended prison sentence following a fight outside a KFC restaurant on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p>He was released on bail in January for a spate of alleged violent incidents before taking to social media to say he was putting that life behind him.</p>

<p>'I can pretty much say 2020 will be the year for the BG! How much money have you lost chasing p****? How much p**** you lost chasing money? Think about it', he wrote. </p>

<p>The former bikie moved to Airlie Beach following the stabbing death of his 17-year-old brother Harrison during a brawl in September, 2019. </p>

<p>At the time of his brother's death, Geppert said he was 'crushed' and 'if I could give my life for you to have yours back I would do so without thinking twice'.</p>

<p>He is due to appear before the Tweed Heads Local Court on Thursday where it's expected Queensland Police will file an application for his extradition. </p>
