<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Team Trump is going after Vice President Joe Biden for claiming in a town hall Thursday that all people 'would still be alive' rather than succumbing to the coronavirus had the president done his job.</p>

<p>Biden tore into the president as usual during a CNN town hall outside his hometown of scranton – then stretched credulity by blaming the president for every single death. He was responding to a question from a woman who lost her mother to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>'If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people — I’m not making this up. Just look at the data. Look at the data,' Biden told her. </p>

<p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden was under fire Friday for claiming at a CNN town hall: 'If the president had done his job, had done his job from the beginning, all the people would still be alive. All the people'</p>

<p>The claim was quickly highlighted in the Washington Post as 'made up' by factchecker Glen Kessler, who has spent much of the last three years correcting claims by President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee blasted the remark in an appearance on Fox News Thursday night.</p>

<p>'Joe Biden went hyperbolic at a super-sonic level,' Huckabee quipped. </p>

<p>'Joe Biden has had more flip-flops than Miami Beach on the Fourth fo July,' he quipped. 'For him to say that every death was the personal fault of the president, that's pretty outrageous.'</p>

<p>'He didn't say a word when the president took the really unpopular step of saying we were going to ban travel from Europe. 'This was early on in this,' Huckabee said. </p>

<p>He claimed the president was following the advice of government scientist, although he brought up Dr. Anthony Fauci, who Trump has publicly clashed with.    </p>

<p>'The president has followed the advice of Dr. Fauci and the counsel that he has surrounded himself with,' said Huckabee.</p>

<p>Biden's remarks came at an event where he ripped the president for his coronavirus response, as the nation approaches 200,000 deaths. He brought up modeling that could show another 200,000 deaths </p>

<p>And he seized on the Bob Woodward tapes revealing Trump calling the virus 'deadly stuff' and admitting he liked 'playing it down' and said: 'He knew it and he did nothing. It's close to criminal.'</p>

<p>'The idea that you're going to not tell people what you've been told that this virus is incredibly contagious, seven times more contagious than the flu. You breathe the air, you get it sucked into your lungs. What has he done?' Biden said. Trump has responded to the taped comments, saying he didn't want to put the country in a 'panic.'</p>

<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, during extended press statement Friday, made comments implying that Biden's remarks were a stretch – while also faulting Trump for actions that led the U.S. to lead the nation in coronavirus deaths.  </p>

<p>'We are 200,000 people dead and that didn't have to happen,' Pelosi said. </p>

<p>'Would they have all been saved? No. But many would have. And there are metrics on this, don't take it from me,' she said. 'There are scientific metrics of how many people could have been saved.'</p>
