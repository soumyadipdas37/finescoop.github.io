<p>YOUR WARDROBE STAPLE</p>

<p>Just like so many other things in our lives now, the way we wear clothes has changed. We may not need formal outfits for work, parties are off the agenda and we all want our wardrobes to multitask with the minimum of fuss. Which is why the little black dress (LBD) has come back into its own. Trends come and go but this one looks set to stay — not even a pandemic can see it off.</p>

<p>KEEP IT CLASSIC</p>

<p>You may associate the LBD with evening occasions but its versatility lends itself to so much more, especially if you choose a simple style. Prada showed it on the catwalk without any fuss and frills, a throwback to Calvin Klein’s sleek minimalist designs from the 1990s. Take a big step away from minidresses, body-con and anything with too much beading or embellishment. Today’s LBD is pared right back: more wearable and practical yet as chic as it ever was.</p>

<p>BE FUSSY ABOUT FABRIC</p>

<p>Pay attention to fabrics. A heavyweight cotton like this one I’m wearing from Cos will not only be more breathable than the sweaty polyester so often consigned to the Christmas dress rails but it will hang better, too. Its midi length is also practical and who doesn’t love a dress with pockets? They make any dress feel more relaxed and yet all it takes is a blazer thrown on top to sharpen it up. My current favourites are Kaya Turello’s power jackets (£170, kayaturello.com).</p>

<p>EMBRACE 1960s STYLE</p>

<p>Style icons Audrey Hepburn and Jackie Onassis had it right — necklines are best kept high with chunky pearls, and oversized sunglasses can be relied on for glamour. I like adding a pop of colour with footwear for a fun finish, but trainers wouldn’t look out of place.</p>
