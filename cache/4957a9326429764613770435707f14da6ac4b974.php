<p>Toned: Amanda exuded confidence as she displayed her toned figure in the ensemble </p>

<p>The TV personality shares the property with her record producer husband of 12 years, Chris Hughes, and their two daughters Lexi, 14, and Hollie, eight. </p>

<p>The Britain's Got Talent host has made the most of her daughters' old playhouse by transforming it into an incredible comfy home for her two rabbits Princess and Beatrice. </p>

<p>Amanda is thought to have spent £6,000 to up-cycle the space for her beloved pets who can now enjoy their own porch and bunk beds, reports The Sun. </p>

<p>Big fans! The video sent Amanda's 1.5 million followers and celebrity pals into meltdown as they called the star the 'hottest radio DJ' </p>

<p>A source said: 'Amanda loves these rabbits, and they're treasured members of the family. It's only right they live like starlets.' </p>

<p>And a representative for Amanda told MailOnline: 'The playhouse was purchased 6 years ago for Lexi and Hollie to play in, but they’ve outgrown it now.  </p>

<p>'Converting it into a home for the rabbits has cost just £200. Rather than dismantling it, Amanda has simply recycled it!' </p>

<p>Pricey! It comes after it was revealed Amanda has ended up with a £6,000 luxury rabbit pen for her bunnies at her south-west London home </p>
