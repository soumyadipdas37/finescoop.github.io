<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Azeem Rafiq has revealed that he filed a complaint with Yorkshire management three years ago amid fresh claims of both racist and insensitive behaviour towards him from those within the club.</p>

<p>Rafiq, 29, said in an interview with BBC Sport that team-mates would stereotype him, saying ‘he stinks’ and use a racially offensive term relating to his Pakistani heritage.</p>

<p>The former England Under 19 captain also indicated that he had reported an individual to director of cricket Martyn Moxon and coach Andrew Gale in 2017. </p>

<p>Cricketer Azeem Rafiq has added more detail to his accusations of racism towards Yorkshire </p>

<p>The ex-Yorkshire captain says he raised issues of racism three years ago but was ignored </p>

<p>He alleged that he left a meeting with Moxon in tears 12 months later, on his first day back at work after his son was still-born in May 2018. </p>

<p>Yorkshire plan to stage an investigation using ‘impartial, external parties’, set to begin at the start of next week. </p>

<p>Rafiqy said: ‘On my first day back after losing my child, I was called into the office by the director of cricket and he gave me a dressing down. He said my attitude was wrong, that the club had done all this work for me. I left that meeting in tears.</p>

<p>Yorkshire have launched an independent investigation into the treatment of Rafiq at the club</p>

<p>‘In 2017, I raised issues about a certain individual to the coach and director of cricket — but while I was pouring my heart out, the director of cricket was too busy looking at the clock. He wasn’t interested.’</p>

<p>Yorkshire chairman Roger Hutton responded, saying in a statement: ‘Everyone at the club had a huge amount of sympathy for Azeem and his family at the time of the tragic loss of his son, and he was encouraged by the club to take more time off... but he chose to return.</p>

<p>‘We want to assure Azeem that we take the all the issues raised extremely seriously. We have tried to contact him this week. We will make further efforts to include first-hand testimony from Azeem in the investigation.’</p>
