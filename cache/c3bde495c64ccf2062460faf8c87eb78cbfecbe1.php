<p>Retired UFC star Conor McGregor had planned to take part but was forced to withdraw as he waits to see if he will be re-arrested over alleged sexual assault and indecent exposure.</p>

<p>McGregor is waiting for the results of ‘key physical tests’ and ‘the examination of film evidence’ before learning whether he will be re-arrested.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) star was taken into police custody on the French holiday island of Corsica last Friday following a complaint from a young woman.</p>

<p>She has claimed the 32-year-old Irishman assaulted her and showed off his manhood following a heavy drinking session in the upmarket port town of Calvi on September 6.</p>

<p>Charlene appeared emotional as she completed the challenge today while her team mates were elated  </p>

<p>McGregor was released on Saturday without charge, but the criminal case is still active and he could be summoned before a magistrate later this week.</p>

<p>Emmanuelle Ramon, McGregor’s lawyer, said his client ‘vigorously denied any wrongdoing’.</p>

<p>‘He has been released before the legal end of police custody and without any judicial review,’ said Mr Ramon.</p>

<p>Audie Attar, McGregor’s manager, said in a statement: ‘I am irate and putting out a warning loud and clear: Conor McGregor is not and will not be a target for those seeking to score a headline or a payday.’</p>
