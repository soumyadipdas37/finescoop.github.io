<p>Researchers at the University of Queensland have designed a method that cryopreserves the shoots and revive them later to grow a healthy plant (pictured)</p>

<p>Professor Neena Mitter: 'I suppose you could say they are space-age avocados – ready to be cryo-frozen and shipped to Mars when human flight becomes possible.'</p>

<p>The team set out on this mission to find a solution to protect the world's supplies of avocados, which are commonly face shortages throughout the year and around the world.</p>

<p>Mitter joked saying their work is not only about protecting the fruit, but also 'ensuring we meet the demand of current and future generations for their smashed 'avo' on toast.'</p>

<p>This is the first time scientists have successfully created a cryopreservation method for avocados – something that has been in the works for more than 40 years.</p>

<p>Hollywood has suggested that space faring heroes living on Mars will have a menu of just potatoes, but scientists are working on a way to add avocados to the list (stock) </p>

<p>University of Queensland PhD student Chris O'Brien, who developed the first critical steps, said:' The aim is to preserve important avocado cultivars and key genetic traits from possible destruction by threats like bushfires, pests and disease such as laurel wilt – a fungus which has the capacity to wipe out all the avocado germplasm in Florida.'</p>

<p>'Liquid nitrogen does not require any electricity to maintain its temperature, so by successfully freeze avocado germplasm, it's an effective way of preserving clonal plant material for an indefinite period.'</p>

<p>Cryopreservation is typically used to freeze sperm and eggs, which is stored at -320 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>However, the process has also been used on other plants including bananas, grape vines and apple.</p>

<p>O'Brien teamed up with Mitter and Dr. Raquel Folgado from The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens in California to perfect his technique.</p>

<p>They began with a clonal shoot tip developed from tissue culture propagation technology, which is a technique used to maintain plant cells.</p>

<p>This allowed up to 500 avocado plants to grow from just one shoot-tip.</p>

<p>However, O'Brien said the initial work resulted in the team sifting through brown mush.</p>

<p>The shoots are placed in an aluminum foil strip and then in a 'cryotube' before being stored in liquid nitrogen</p>

<p>The team says it takes about 20 minutes for the shoots to recover and within two months, the plants regrew leaves</p>

<p>'There was no protocol so I experimented with priming the tips with Vitamin C, and used other pre-treatments like sucrose and cold temperature to prepare the cells – it was a question of trial and error to get the optimal mixture and correct time points,' he said.</p>

<p>After some trial and error, the group placed the shoot tips on an aluminum foil strip.</p>

<p>This was key to allowing it to quickly cool and rewarm without becoming a slush.</p>

<p>And then the strips were put into 'cryotubes' that were stored in liquid nitrogen.</p>

<p>'It takes about 20 minutes to recover them,' Mr O'Brien said.</p>

<p>'In about two months they have new leaves and are ready for rooting before beginning a life in the orchard.'</p>

<p>The team achieved 80 percent success in regrowing frozen Reed avocado plants and 60 percent with the Velvick cultivar.</p>
