<p>Thanks for joining me today on Sportsmail's live transfer blog. We'll be back here tomorrow morning so make sure you tune in for all the latest news and gossip. </p>

<p>Manchester City fans are nervously waiting to see if the club can pull off an unthinkable move for Lionel Messi, and we have a first comment on the saga from the Etihad as defender Joao Cancelo tipped the Argentine to be a success if he were to sign. </p>

<p>The full-back called him a 'great player' and said he would have a great season with quality players by his side.</p>

<p>Fulham boss Scott Parker is thought to be keen to keep a balanced squad this season after the club went on a massive spending spree the last time they were in the top flight - as they were sent straight back down to the Championship.</p>

<p>But reports say the Whites have identified winger Traore as a target to add quality to Parker's squad and give them a good chance of staying in the league.</p>

<p>Lyon are believed to be happy to sell Traore, but Fulham are set to face competition from Leicester, Everton and Newcastle.</p>

<p>Allan's switch to Everton drew ever closer on Wednesday afternoon as the Brazilian midfielder was pictured arriving in Liverpool on a private jet.</p>

<p>The Napoli midfielder was seen exiting the aircraft with his wife Thais Marques and the pair were collected by a member of club staff.  </p>

<p>He travelled to Liverpool to undergo a medical with Everton ahead of sealing a £21million switch, which will see him reunite with Carlo Ancelotti.  </p>

<p>ADRIAN KAJUMBA: Aston Villa have agreed a £16m deal with Nottingham Forest for right-back Matty Cash.</p>

<p>Villa have made a breakthrough in their attempts to land Cash after seeing a number of previous bids rejected.</p>

<p>A Villa offer made up of an initial £14m fee with a further £2m in add-ons has now been accepted by Nottingham Forest.</p>

<p>Leipzig defender Dayot Upamecano has revealed he has held talks with other clubs about a possible transfer this summer - but insists he is in no rush to leave.</p>

<p>The Frenchman is interesting a number of teams after some colossal displays at the back for the Bundesliga side in 2019-20, including a man of the match performance in their Champions League win over Atletico Madrid.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Manchester United are looking to prize Upamecano away from Leipzig as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to reinforce his defence and find a top quality centre-back partner for captain Harry Maguire.</p>

<p>While Messi's departure is far from set in stone, reports from the player's camp that there is no way back are hardly inspiring as Barcelona clutch at straws to keep the Argentine at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Victor Font - a candidate for the club's presidency next year - believes it is unlikely Messi will change his stance after telling Barca he wants to leave - but says the club are hopeful they can convince him to stay during crunch talks. </p>

<p>Messi's father Jorge will hold crucial discussions with the hierarchy today, and Font feels that so long as there is a dialogue, there is a chance he could perform a U-turn. He also said the superstar could return to the club in some capacity - even if he leaves for Man City.  </p>

<p>ADRIAN KAJUMBA: Grady Diangana has been given permission to discuss personal terms with West Brom after they had a bid for the attacking midfielder accepted by West Ham.</p>

<p>The Baggies have made their move for the 22 year-old, who spent last season on loan at the Hawthorns, with an offer worth in the region of £20m including add-ons.</p>

<p>West Brom are keen to finalise terms with Diangana and wrap up his return as soon as possible, mindful of rival interest.</p>

<p>Having a player model your new jersey for next season is usually a good sign. But in this case, Messi wearing Barcelona's 20-21 kit doesn't seem to hint he's set for a dramatic U-turn - and fans are far from happy.</p>

<p>Some supporters believe Barca are using his image to boost kit sales, as the Argentinian stands centre next to Ousmane Dembele, Antoine Griezmann, Frenkie de Jong, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Gerard Pique.</p>

<p>Pique is another name linked with an exit from Barca, but with so many players facing uncertain futures at the club, the marketing team don't have much to work with.</p>

<p>It's open season on top players who were relegated from the Premier League last season and Watford are bracing for interest in some of their prized assets. </p>

<p>One of those is midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure, who had a few suitors when he was a top-flight player. Now rival clubs will smell a bargain for the Frenchman. Monaco are said to have joined the race for his signature, but they'll face a battle with Everton.</p>

<p>The Toffees had a £30m bid rejected by the Hornets last year and will be hopeful of a discount, while Monaco will try to persuade him to return to his home country. </p>

<p>The latest drama in the Messi saga unfolds. Ahead of showdown talks with the club, the player's father Jorge said few words when asked about his future but admitted it would be tough for the Argentine to commit to the club.</p>

<p>Jorge arrived in the Catalan city on Wednesday morning as he looks to gain clarity on the future of Messi, who continues to boycott pre-season training in a bid to force through his departure.</p>

<p>PETE JENSON: Gareth Bale's departure from Real Madrid is likely to be frustrated by the club's reluctance to pay off the remaining two years of his salary. </p>

<p>Bale's €17million (£15.1m) salary over his remaining two years would mean Madrid would have to negotiate a possible €34m (£30.2m) payoff which they are not in a position to do. </p>

<p>Marca suggested a meeting between Bale's representatives Stellar Group has already been set up but Sportsmail understands there is still no imminent meeting planned.  </p>

<p>Most goalkeepers would call it a day after the nightmare season Kepa Arrizabalaga had at Stamford Bridge in 2019-20. But the Spaniard is determined to be a success in west London and wants to battle for the No 1 jersey - even if the club sign a new keeper.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard looked less than impressed with Kepa after a string of errors last season, bringing in Willy Cabellero for a handful of games, and the club have been linked with Rennes shot stopper Edouard Mendy.</p>

<p>Kepa will still be hoping to go to the Euros with Spain next summer but must show a huge improvement in his displays this season for that to happen.</p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara has long been linked with a move to Liverpool but could he be set for a switch to their rivals instead?</p>

<p>Manchester United have reportedly attempted to beat the Reds to the signing of the talented centre-mid from Bayern Munich with German media claiming Old Trafford officials have approached his representatives.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old is out of contract next year and has a £29m price tag on his head. With midfielder Donny van de Beek incoming for £40m - will Ole Gunnar Solskjaer try to get Thiago in as well?</p>

<p>We have our first deal of the day and it's from the SPL with Celtic boss Neil Lennon bolstering his squad as Irishman Duffy joins his ranks. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old had fallen down the pecking order at the Amex Stadium in recent months and will now spend the 2020-21 campaign with the reigning Scottish Premiership champions.</p>

<p>Duffy, who completed his medical in Dublin, where he is currently based with the Republic of Ireland squad, made just one start for Brighton following the resumption of the season.</p>

<p>ALVISE CAGNAZZO: Juventus have earmarked Luis Suarez as the world-class player to lead their attack. </p>

<p>This season the Uruguayan will turn 34 but his age has not deterred the Italian champions, who are eager to see him replicate his performances for Barcelona in Turin.</p>

<p>Both Gazzetta dello Sport and Corriere dello Sport report that Suarez and Juventus have reached an agreement over the switch. </p>

<p>It's all happening at Barcelona isn't it? It looks like the club are preparing for life after Messi and a long term transfer target in Lautaro Martinez looks like he may finally get his move from Inter Milan. </p>

<p>According to reports, Barca have approached the Serie A side about a swap deal and could use Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal as a makeweight. </p>

<p>Martinez is one of the most coveted forwards in the game and could be asked to spearhead Ronald Koeman's new era if the signing is secured. With Luis Suarez also on his way out, the club's striking spots are there for the taking. </p>

<p>The former Gunners boss has been linked with a handful of Arsenal players of late but its believed Unai Emery wants to take goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez to Villarreal.</p>

<p>Emery was appointed by the yellow submarine this summer and is looking at a few options to give himself a strong start to LaLiga, and Martinez would help provide competition to Sergio Asenjo.</p>

<p>But the Spaniard should have his work cut out with the Argentine enjoying the No 1 jersey under Mikel Arteta at present while Bernd Leno sits out injured.</p>

<p>He'll be keeping an eye on the situation when Leno returns as reports claim Martinez - who is the birthday boy today - will only leave if he doesn't emerge as first choice.  </p>

<p>It's a big day at Barcelona today. In fact, one of the biggest in the club's history as Lionel Messi's father Jorge jets in for huge talks with club chiefs about the future of his superstar son.</p>

<p>Messi Snr will meet with club president Josep Bartomeu, who has fallen out with the Argentine forward, as he looks to seal a mega move to Manchester City. The player himself believes he can leave on a free transfer, while Barca insist he still has a year left on his deal - with a £629m release clause.</p>

<p>The situation remains complicated and there are many details to be thrashed out before this saga can progress. You can follow all the latest on those talks today with Harry Slavin. </p>

<p>A player has made a U-turn on a possible transfer between Barcelona and Manchester City... but it's not the one you think. </p>

<p>Eric Garcia looked set for the Etihad exit door this summer after refusing to sign a new contract, and Ronald Koeman was keen to take the teenager back to Spain after coming through their La Masia academy. </p>

<p>But for now, the centre-back claims he's focused on playing for Pep Guardiola, despite having just a year left on his current deal.</p>

<p>Chelsea seem to be edging closer to a stunning deal to sign Leverkusen's Kai Havertz with German media claiming he has already completed a medical at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The Blues already have four signings through the door with £130m spent, and now Frank Lampard is nearing a £90m deal for the talented midfielder.</p>

<p>If it goes ahead, it will edge past Manchester United's £89m signing of Paul Pogba as the biggest transfer in English football.</p>

<p>It turns out Barcelona aren't only focused on outgoings this summer. Reports from Spain say talks with Liverpool midfielder Gini Wijnaldum have kicked off, and the Dutchman has already agreed terms with the Nou Camp outfit. </p>

<p>He would link up with his Holland boss Ronald Koeman if he made the move to the Catalan side and it's believed Barca are willing to offer no more than £18m for the 29-year-old. After Rakitic departed yesterday, there is an opening in the middle.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum was key for Jurgen Klopp in their title-winning season but has just one year remaining on his deal.  </p>

<p>Hello and welcome to another exciting day in the transfer window. </p>

<p>Things are really hotting up now with major deals being announced every day. Yesterday Arsenal finally confirmed defender Gabriel Magalhaes after a transfer saga that was dragging on all summer, while Barcelona's clearout began with midfielder Ivan Rakitic leaving for former club Sevilla. </p>

<p>There is also the small matter of Lionel Messi's future to deal with as his representatives start crunch talks with the Spanish giants over a mega move this summer. It promises to be an eventful day in store.</p>
