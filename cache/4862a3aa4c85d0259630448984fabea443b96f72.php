<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez was greeted by photographers, journalists and Juventus fans as the Barcelona striker arrived in Perugia to take an Italian exam. </p>

<p>Suarez has been deemed surplus to requirements at the Nou Camp by new boss Ronald Koeman and that has accelerated interest in him from Italian champions Juventus. </p>

<p>But with Andrea Pirlo limited as to the number of non-EU (European Union) players he can acquire in one window, the club need Suarez to pass his exam in Perugia and acquire dual nationality to make a transfer possible this month. </p>

<p>The Barcelona striker was wearing a mask and was met by Juventus supporters on his arrival</p>

<p>He got into a car with his entourage and headed for the university ahead of taking his exam</p>

<p>Suarez, 33, has been deemed surplus to requirements by new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman</p>

<p>Suarez took part in training with his Barcelona team-mates earlier on Thursday before flying to Perugia for the university exam.  </p>

<p>Juventus have already brought in Brazilian international Arthur Melo and Unites States midfielder Weston McKennie this summer, limiting their options in pursuit of the 33-year-old striker.  </p>

<p>The transfer deadline closes on October 5 but Suarez's appearance at the university in Perugia on Thursday is the clearest indication yet that he is pushing to secure a move to Turin to join Juventus. </p>

<p>Serie A rules state Juventus can only sign two non-EU players each year and Brazilian midfielder Arthur, who joined from Barcelona earlier in this window, took one of the spots</p>

<p>Suarez arrived in denim shorts, trainers and a white Puma t-shirt as he was seen wearing a face mask due to the ongoing health concerns for players amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>There were reported jeers on his arrival at the university with some passers-by making jokes about Giorgio Chiellini, who Suarez famously bit at the 2014 World Cup when playing against Italy for Uruguay.  </p>

<p>More to follow.  </p>
