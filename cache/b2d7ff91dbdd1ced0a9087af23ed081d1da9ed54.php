<p>Shocking: Loose Women has been hit with over 100 Ofcom complaints after Ivana Trump's controversial appearance on the ITV show on Monday </p>

<p>On the show, Ivana - who is herself a legal immigrant to the US - said she is 'very proud' of her former partner, particularly for 'all he has achieved with immigration', insisting that all who migrate to America should 'enter legally'.</p>

<p>She then went on to rant about US immigrants, in an outburst which saw her claim 'they do not dressing Americanly' once in the country, while accusing some immigrants of 'not having a job, stealing, and raping American women'. </p>

<p>Her comments were met with outrage from both the panel and viewers, leading to fans of the show contacting Ofcom with over 100 complaints, The Sun report. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Ivana, Ofcom and ITV for comment.  </p>

<p>That was then: Donald Trump's ex-wife, 71, who was married to the president for 15 years til 1990, was branded a 'bigoted embarrassment' for her 'disturbing' comments on US immigration, in which she claimed: 'They steal and rape the women'  </p>

<p>Challenged: In the space of four days, the regulatory body received over 100 complaints for the exchange, in which the Czech businesswoman locked horns with panellist Jane Moore, 58, who told her that the comments were 'inhumane and offensive' </p>

<p>Jane said: 'What you've just said about migrants a lot of people would find quite offensive. You're a migrant yourself - are you not shutting the door behind you?... </p>

<p>'Do you not understand some people just want a better life? How you describe them is quite inhumane.'</p>

<p>Ivana replied: 'It is inhumane but everybody has to pick themselves up. They have to go and apply for the visa properly then they come to America. They can come and cross the border properly.'</p>

<p>She grew up in Czechoslovakia and moved to Canada in September 1973. She met Trump at a modeling event in New York City in 1976, and they married in April 1977. </p>

<p>Scandal: On the show, Ivana - who is herself a legal immigrant to the US - said she is 'very proud' of her former partner, particularly for 'all he has achieved with immigration', insisting that all who migrate to America should 'enter legally' </p>

<p>The couple's first son, Donald Trump Jr, was born later that year in December. They welcomed their daughter Ivanka in 1981 and then their son Eric in 1984.</p>

<p>All three children were born in New York, making them US citizens. </p>

<p>Ivana was legally living in the country at the time, but she didn't become a US citizen until 1988, although she was eligible for naturalization and citizenship three years after tying the knot to the President Of The United States.</p>

<p>During her interview, Ivana addressed her own emigration to the US, insisting that she 'has no problem with immigrants' if they enter the country legally, pay taxes, and 'be a part of society' - while suggesting that those who travel to the US illegally all become involved in criminal activities.</p>

<p>Scandalous: Her comments left viewers outraged, with one calling the outburst 'disturbing', while another called the mother-of-three an 'embarrassing bigot' (the former couple pictured in 1989) </p>

<p>Her comments left viewers outraged, with one calling the outburst 'disturbing', while another called the mother-of-three an 'embarrassing bigot'.</p>

<p>When asked whether she is proud of her ex husband, she said: 'Very proud, he was my husband of 15 years, I wish him all the best.</p>

<p>'I see he can do a great job, he is pro everything which I believe in. He is Republican and so am I. He has achieved so much - especially with immigration.</p>

<p>'I am an immigrant, and I have no problem with the immigrants, but they must come into the country legally and get a job and pay taxes like the rest of the Americans and just live and and be part of society.</p>

<p>'There are some people who don't even dress Americanly, they dress whatever they dress in and they don't get a job and they steal and they rape the women and that is not the idea.' </p>
