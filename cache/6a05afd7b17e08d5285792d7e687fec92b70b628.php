<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain have reportedly entered the race to land Jorginho from Chelsea by opening talks over a loan move to the French capital.</p>

<p>The Italy midfielder has started the Blues' first two Premier League games of the season but was substituted in both before being dropped for Saturday's 3-3 draw at West Bromwich Albion. </p>

<p>With the summer arrival of Kai Havertz, competition is high for a starting spot in the Blues midfield and the 28-year-old could be open to a move away from west London.</p>

<p>Jorginho (centre) was dropped for Chelsea's 3-3 draw at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday</p>

<p>According to Telefoot, French champions PSG have already 'established a connection' with Chelsea over signing Jorginho on loan.</p>

<p>However, Thomas Tuchel's side are expected to face a fight for the signature of the former Napoli star from Arsenal who are also keen on landing the player. </p>

<p>Jorginho arrived at Chelsea in 2018 in a move worth around £57million as he followed manager Maurizio Sarri from Napoli where he had starred in Serie A.</p>

<p>PSG are hoping to land the midfielder on loan who started Chelsea's first two league games</p>

<p>Despite Sarri's departure a year later, he remained a key part of Lampard's side that finished inside the top four last term to seal a return to the Champions League.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Chelsea's midfield clear out could see N'Golo Kante leave the club, with Manchester United making a shock enquiry for the 29-year-old.</p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek may also be surplus to requirements as Aston Villa, West Ham and Southampton chase England's World Cup star from two years ago in Russia. </p>
