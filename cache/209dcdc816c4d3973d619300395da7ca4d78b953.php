<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ministers have given green light for grouse shooting to be included on a list of sports that are exempt from coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>The new ‘rule of six’, which came into force yesterday, bans gatherings of seven or more people in England.</p>

<p>But government guidelines provide an exemption for shooting - including hunting and paintball that requires a shotgun or firearms certificate licence - as an organised sport that can be done in groups.</p>

<p>Ministers have given green light for grouse shooting to be included on a list of sports that are exempt from coronavirus restrictions</p>

<p>Other physical activities that can be done in with five or more others include team sports such as football, hockey and netball, as well as sailing, angling and polo.</p>

<p>The guidance states: ‘When participating in organised sport or licensed physical activity, you must not gather in groups of more than six before and after the activity. </p>

<p>'You must also ensure you socially distance from people you do not live with (or have formed a support bubble with) wherever possible.</p>

<p>‘When playing sports informally with people you don’t live with, you must limit the size of your group to six. It is illegal to do so in a larger group and you may be fined.’</p>

<p>The government last night faced criticism from opponents of hunting, but received praise from those who had warned that a ban would impact the rural economy.</p>

<p>Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said well-organised shooting and hunting meets posed ‘no serious risk’ to the spread of the disease, as both activities take place outdoors where organisers are able to implement social distancing.</p>

<p>Mr Bonner said applying the rule of six to country sports would have been a heavy blow to rural communities, which have already been hit hard by the loss of much of the tourist season.</p>

<p>‘Both hunting and shooting are intrinsic parts of the countryside, both economically and socially,’ he said. </p>

<p>‘Many areas of the countryside have suffered economically during the lockdown... In some areas, hunting and shooting are the main drivers of tourism in the winter months.’ </p>
