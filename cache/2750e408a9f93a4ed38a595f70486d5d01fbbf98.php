<p>The reality star previously hit out at trolls who criticised his marriage in a foul-mouthed rant after a fan questioned why Jacqueline stays with him.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Because we love each other, have a beautiful family, I'm a good husband, good dad to our kids, we get on well, laugh together, super attracted to each other…</p>

<p>'Any more reasons you need? You didn't know none of that, eh? That's because you do not f***ing know me, or my wife, or us as a couple lol.</p>

<p>'So concentrate on your own life and you (sic) clearly never been taught to not be rude, especially to people you don't even know. Hope you've learnt something from this.'</p>

<p>The response stemmed from a post Jacqueline shared the previous day of herself and husband Dan, urging him to 'hurry home please' amid his recent Turkey trip.</p>
