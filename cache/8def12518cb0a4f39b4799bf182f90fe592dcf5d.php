<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Government Ministers have confirmed that abandoned migrant boats will be donated to charities, after the proposal was made by Dover &amp; Deal MP Natalie Elphicke.</p>

<p>Mrs Elphicke, who has been calling for a crackdown on illegal people-smuggling across the English Channel, approached Ministers about the idea in July.</p>

<p>It comes after MailOnline revealed they are being stored on an industrial estate in the Whitfield area of the Kent port town. </p>

<p>Mrs Elphicke said she was keen to see if the vessels could be used locally by groups such as Walmer RNLI and the Sea Scouts.</p>

<p>The boats are stacked three high and in multiple rows and vary from fibreglass rowing boats to high tech large ribs used by unscrupulous gangs who exploit migrants' desire to come to the UK. </p>

<p>Long after having served their purpose in bringing people across the Channel, the boats, some of which cost thousands of pounds, lay discarded, deflated and damaged.</p>

<p>Hundreds of the vessels once used by migrants are stacked up at the warehouse facility</p>

<p>A number of engines from various vessels can be seen on wooden pallets near facility in Kent</p>

<p>In a letter to her this week, Immigration Compliance Minister Chris Philp said the Home Office had 'taken steps to implement a system which will allow for the Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boats (RHIBS) to be donated to interested charity and voluntary sector groups, subject to completion of the necessary legal requirements.'</p>

<p>He added: 'A number of charities have registered their interest in this scheme, and some representatives have already visited the site or are booked to visit.</p>

<p>'Upon visiting, they can view the potentially available boats and inform our Border Force teams which RHIBS they have an interest in obtaining.'</p>

<p>MP Natalie Elphicke welcomed the news, while warning that the focus must remain on bringing the crossings to an end 'once and for all'.</p>

<p>She said: 'Residents came to me with this sensible idea to put dinghies to good use after the Home Office have finished examining them - so I welcome Ministers listening and taking it forward.</p>

<p>'Yet I have also been clear that the real focus should be on making sure the dangerous crossings themselves end once and for all.'</p>

<p>It comes as record numbers of migrants continue to cross the channel throughout 2020.</p>

<p>September is already the busiest month for migrants crossing the Channel by small boat ever recorded.</p>

<p>Dover MP Natalie Elphicke speaks about the migrant crossings crisis at Dover port, Kent</p>

<p>The Home Office confirmed 26 people were detained in two separate incidents on Wednesday.</p>

<p>It means at least 1,487 have made the treacherous journey across the world's busiest shipping route this month.</p>

<p>The total now surpasses the 1,468 migrants who made it to the UK by small boat during the previous record month of August.</p>

<p>Wednesday's arrivals take the total for the year to 6,512. There are not expected to be any migrant crossings today or for the next three to four days until Tuesday as tides have changed and water is very choppy.</p>

<p>French authorities have warned people to be on guard due to weather.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Maritime Prefecture of the Channel and the North Sea said: 'This is why the maritime prefect calls for the utmost caution of all users of the sea, and in particular those who practice fishing on foot or who will walk on the coast subject to the tide.</p>

<p>'A few minutes can sometimes be enough to be isolated by the rising tide.</p>

<p>'The high tides have the consequence of increasing the tidal range (difference between the height of the open sea and that of the low tide) with a greater mixing of sea water; they therefore make sea currents stronger and the sea more dangerous.'</p>

<p>But despite high northerly winds on Wednesday, French authorities rescued a further 24 migrants attempting to cross the Channel.</p>

<p>Waleed (C), 29, a Kuwaiti migrant, sits in a dinghy with his brother's family and other migrants as they illegally cross the English Channel from France to Britain on September 11, 2020</p>

<p>A group of 17 were recovered at 2pm while another boat of seven were found at 6pm. All were returned to Boulogne-sur-mer.</p>

<p>Mrs Elphicke said last Friday: 'I fully appreciate the strength of feeling about the continued small boats crossings. With around 6,000 illegal entrants this year alone, it is entirely unacceptable.</p>

<p>'I am working hard on this, and the Government has outlined a number of steps that it is taking to tackle this issue.'</p>

<p>Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said: 'These crossings are facilitated by callous criminals who risk people's lives for money.</p>

<p>'We are working with our French counterparts to make this route completely unviable and continue to crack down on the criminal gangs responsible - making 50 arrests so far this year.</p>

<p>'These migrants are leaving France which is a safe country, where those seeking refuge can and should claim asylum, rather than attempting these perilous crossings to the UK.</p>

<p>'We continue to return those who do not have a legitimate asylum claim despite barriers to removals under the Dublin Regulations and legal challenges, and more flights are planned in the upcoming weeks.'</p>

<p> Yesterday, pictures revealed French border guards escorting a boatload of 16 migrants into British waters and 'dumping' them there.</p>

<p>The incident was witnessed on Tuesday morning from a fishing boat about 12 miles from Folkestone near the French-British sea border.</p>

<p>French RIB speeds towards migrants as they sail through French waters in perilous conditions</p>

<p>But French do nothing even though migrant boat is so low in choppy waters with high winds</p>

<p>The images capture the moment a French rigid inflatable boat or RIB, carrying two border guards, was dispatched from a larger naval vessel to check on the migrants. </p>

<p>But, rather than block them from entering British waters, they allowed the illegal crossing to continue.</p>

<p>Most of the 16 on board the little inflatable were understood to be Afghan nationals, including two children and two women. </p>

<p>A passenger on the fishing boat said they called UK Border Force just after 7.45am because it looked as if the overloaded vessel was about to sink. The migrants were using cut up plastic bottles to it bail out.</p>
