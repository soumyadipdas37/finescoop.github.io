<p>Woolworths (pictured) planned to run the Disney figurine promotion until October 20 but revealed stocks would run out this weekend due to 'extraordinary demand'</p>

<p>Customers receive one of the Ooshies for every $30 spent in store. There are 36 Disney+ Ooshies, with the popular promotion combining the worlds of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars.  </p>

<p>Other customers have also shared their observations of crazed shoppers verbally abusing Woolworths staff members.    </p>

<p>'Poor girl that works at my local Woolies was in tears after copping a verbal beating from some knob because they were out of Ooshies,' one user wrote. </p>

<p>'Every time I've gone to Woolworths, there's some Ooshie related fight going on.</p>

<p>'“What do you mean the Ooshies are out of stock? I bought so much groceries because my kids want Ooshies! Unbelievable!",' another commenter said.      </p>

<p>Woolworths has urged customers to treat supermarket staff with respect.    </p>

<p>'The safety of our team members is our top priority and we will not accept customer abuse in any circumstance.</p>

<p>'Our team members are doing the very best they can to look after our customers, so please support them, and each other,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.   </p>

<p>Woolworths employees and shoppers (pictured in a Woolworths store) took to social media to share instances where staff had been mistreated over the Ooshie collectables </p>

<p>The supermarket giant also said the incidents were isolated and did not appear to be widespread across stores.   </p>

<p>'We've found the vast majority of customers have been respectful towards our team members and we thank them for their patience,' the spokesperson said. </p>

<p>The Disney collectables were initially supposed to be available until October 20. </p>

<p>Woolworths also told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday the promotion had to end early because the Ooshies were 'extraordinarily popular with customers'.    </p>

<p>'These collectibles take more than 12 months to plan and the quantity produced is based on our experience of running many collectible campaigns that we've previously offered. </p>

<p>'To our customers, we thank you for your excitement and engagement with the Disney+ Ooshies and apologise for any frustration or disappointment caused by running out of stock,' the spokesperson said. </p>

<p>The Ooshie collection was launched in Victoria last week after a delayed start due to Stage Four lockdown. </p>

<p>Woolworths said that staff abuse over Ooshies (collection pictured) was not happening at all stores and there had only been 'isolated cases' at some supermarkets </p>
