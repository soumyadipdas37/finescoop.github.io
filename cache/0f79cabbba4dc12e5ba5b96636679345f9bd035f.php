<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has admitted he considered leaving Arsenal this summer</p>

<p>'Two things persuaded me to stay,' he told Sky Sports. 'The first thing was Mikel Arteta, because since he came in he brings a lot of positivity and a new philosophy for us.</p>

<p>'I think that was important because it matched my game and I feel that I can improve with him. I think this was the key factor and as well, the love that I receive from the fans and the whole club.</p>

<p>'Everyone is treating me very, very good, so I feel at home and that's why I'm staying.</p>

<p>Barcelona made a bid to lure the 31-year-old striker to the Nou Camp this summer</p>

<p>'We had a chat during lockdown and we were supposed to talk about a game and he said 'okay, forget about it, we're going to talk about the future' and he asked me what I wanted to do.</p>

<p>'I was like 'I feel good since you came, I'm improving, and the philosophy is very, very nice so I just want to stay' and he was like 'I'm sure if you stay you can leave a legacy, but it's all about you and what you want. Of course you can leave and go for trophies in big clubs as well but I think you can create a legacy here in this great club.'</p>

<p>'This was the key message to me and after that conversation I was like 'okay, it's all clear for me and I just want to stay' and that's it.'</p>
