<p>A British holidaymaker has told how she stared death in the face during a horror boating accident in Ibiza.</p>

<p>Scot Suzanne Cassidy was sucked into the propeller blades of a speedboat which had just pulled her through the water on an inflatable doughnut ring.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old nursery worker only survived by grabbing on to the side of the boat and twisting her body round as the razor-sharp blades hacked into her leg.</p>

<p>Lucky escape: Suzanne Cassidy was sucked into the propellers of a pleasure boat in Ibiza. She said she is lucky to be alive</p>

<p>Friends saved her life by pulling her aboard and helping her get to hospital as she started haemorrhaging blood from a wound near her knee which required several stitches. She also suffered a badly broken leg.</p>

<p>She is recovering after an emergency operation at Can Misses Hospital in Ibiza Town.</p>

<p>Her tibia was left sticking out of her right leg in the accident and the broken bone had to be pinned back together.</p>

<p>Suzanne, from Glasgow, only arrived in Ibiza 11 weeks ago to start a summer job in a bar.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm just glad to be alive. I really thought I was going to die.</p>

<p>'I knew immediately the danger I was in when I felt my leg being sucked towards the propellers by the force of the engine.</p>

<p>'Somehow I found the strength in my upper body to twist myself around and away from danger.</p>

<p>'My friends pulled me back on board the boat and that's when I saw the blood.</p>

<p>'I could feel the throbbing in my leg where it was broken but I was running on adrenaline by that point and I didn't want to look at it so I only found out the bone had been sticking out of my leg after I came to from the operation.</p>

<p>'It was a four-and-a-half-hour operation. Friends have asked me how many pins and stitches they've put in my leg but I just don't know.'</p>

<p>Accident: Suzanne was saved by friends who pulled her aboard the boat in the party resort of San Antonio and got her to hospital quickly</p>

<p>The accident happened around 4pm on Sunday in a pretty cove near the party resort of San Antonio called Cala Conta.</p>

<p>Suzanne had jumped into the water to swim to a bigger boat anchored nearby after being dragged through the sea in an inflatable ring with friends.</p>

<p>She said: 'We'd gone out as part of celebrations for a friend's 30th birthday party with other pals and my boss at the bar I'm working at.</p>

<p>'Five of us had just finished our turn on the ring and we were doing a changeover with other friends who were waiting in the bigger boat so they could go out for their turn.</p>

<p>'It all happened so quickly. I don't know if our boat moved or I jumped into the sea too near the engine but I don't remember hearing any warning.</p>

<p>'I've been told I'll be in hospital for another four or five days and I won't be able to fly for a while.</p>

<p>'I'll probably head back to Scotland at the end of September when I was due to fly back anyway.</p>

<p>'The doctors have told me I'll walk again without a limp. And I love dancing so with time I'll be looking forward to dancing again."</p>

<p>Local Civil Guard officers have launched an investigation into the incident.</p>

<p>The owners of the boat involved in the accident were not available for comment.</p>

<p>Suzanne, who is working in Ibiza for the summer, was enjoying birthday celebrations on the island when the accident happened</p>
