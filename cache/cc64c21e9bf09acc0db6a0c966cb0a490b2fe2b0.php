<p>First Lady duties: Melania Trump, 50, hosted a roundtable discussion to raise awareness for sickle cell disease (SCD) on Monday</p>

<p>Outfit of the day: Melania cut a stylish figure in a $945 white belted midi dress by Max Mara and added a pop of color to her sleek look with her sky-high orange stilettos</p>

<p>Style: Melania's highlighted brown hair was styled loosely around her shoulders, and she stuck with her signature makeup: dark, smokey eyeshadow and a pink lip</p>

<p>The former model's perfectly tailored sheath dress was made in Italy from stretch wool, fully lined, and cut with a single vent in the back. </p>

<p>The sold-out design comes with a removable woven belt that matches the frock's braided trims, which she opted to wear.      </p>

<p>Melania has favored minimalistic looks over the years, and Monday's look was no exception. She let her shoes and dress doing to talking by keeping her jewelry to a minimum. </p>

<p>The first lady wore nothing more than two sparkly platinum and diamond bands — one on each of her hands.  </p>

<p>Her highlighted brown hair was styled loosely around her shoulders, and she stuck with her signature makeup: dark, smokey eyeshadow and a pink lip.</p>

<p>Ready to go: The first lady had a bright smile on her face when she entered the State Dining Room of the White House ahead of the discussion</p>

<p>Happy: Melania spoke with SCD patients, researchers, and medical professionals at the event</p>

<p>Attendees: Melania, who did not wear a mask, was seated between a young patient named Samuel Price and Ashley Valentine, the co-founder and president of Sick Cells</p>

<p>Risky? While there were sickle cell disease patients of varying ages, including children, only a few people who were seated at the table wore a mask</p>

<p>Having sickle cell disease increases a person's risk for severe illness from COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   </p>

<p>Melania, who did not wear a mask, was seated between a young patient named Samuel Price and Ashley Valentine, the co-founder and president of Sick Cells, which raises awareness for SCD. </p>

<p>Valentine was one of the few attendees who was photographed wearing a mask, though she briefly removed it while speaking.  </p>

<p>Right on time: The event came just a few weeks after President Donald Trump formally recognized September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month</p>

<p>Chronic condition: Sickle cell disease is the umbrella term for a group of inherited conditions that severely affect red blood cells</p>

<p>All ears: Melania listened intently as sickle cell disease patient Samuel Price spoke </p>

<p>Sickle cell disease is the umbrella term for a group of inherited conditions that severely affect red blood cells.</p>

<p>Healthy red blood cells — produced by stem cells within bone marrow — are biconcave discs that can bend and flex easily. However, in those with sickle cell disease, faulty stem cells produce red blood cells that are crescent shaped.</p>

<p>They are rigid, unable to squeeze through smaller blood vessels and prone to causing blockages that deprive parts of the body of oxygen.</p>

<p>Sufferers are not expected to live beyond 60 and treatment mainly focuses on alleviating symptoms, such as pain and infections, through blood transfusions and painkillers.</p>

<p>The disease affects about 100,000 people in the U.S., and disproportionately affects African and Hispanic-Americans to a higher degree.</p>

<p>In 2018, President Trump signed into law the Sickle Cell Disease and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention, and Treatment Act, a prevention and treatment program that authorizes initiatives for research.  </p>

<p>This year, on August 31, he formally recognized September as Sickle Cell Disease Awareness Month.   </p>
