<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Flavoured ice cubes containing the breast milk of women who have had Covid-19 could help fight off the life-threatening infection, scientists say.</p>

<p>Dutch researchers claim to have found antibodies in 30 mothers' breast milk after they recovered from Covid-19. </p>

<p>Breast milk could therefore be used to protect the most vulnerable people in the event of a second wave, experts claimed. </p>

<p>They said the best way to provide this would not be a drink, but rather sucking an ice cube.</p>

<p>This, they claim, gives the antibodies more of a chance to latch on to the mucous membranes of the mouth and airways, where they can prevent the coronavirus from spreading further in the body.</p>

<p>The blood of Covid-19 survivors, rich in antibodies, is already being used to treat patients, including in the UK.</p>

<p>Using breast milk is a 'strange picture', the Dutch team admit - but if it can help to prevent infection, it should not be frowned upon.</p>

<p>Thousands of women have responded to a campaign asking them to donate 100ml of breast milk for further research. </p>

<p>The thick yellowish milk (colostrum) produced for the first few days following birth is particularly rich in antibodies against other viruses, such as chickenpox, according to the NHS.</p>

<p>The antibodies are not destroyed by pasteurisation - a heating process necessary in order to kill pathogens before it can be drunk by other people. This means they could be pasteurised and then made into a form of ice cream or ice cubes and given to patients suffering the infection, it is claimed (stock of milk cubes)</p>

<p>The initial study, a collaboration between Emma Children's Hospital of Amsterdam UMC and other institutes, started in April.</p>

<p>Dr Britt Van Keulen, of the Dutch Breast milk bank of Amsterdam UMC, said: 'We know breast milk protects newborn children against respiratory infections.</p>

<p>'That's because there are antibodies in breast milk. By breastfeeding, the mother passes on her own antibodies to her child. '  </p>

<p>Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance, like the coronavirus. </p>

<p>The role of antibodies is to latch on to invading pathogens and mark them for other immune cells, such as T-cells, to kill. </p>

<p>Neutralising antibodies are able to kill the virus themselves, rather than just tagging it for other immune cells to attack.  </p>

<p>Researchers recruited 30 women who had already recovered from Covid-19.</p>

<p>They claim laboratory experiments showed the antibodies they found are powerful enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus, The Times reported.</p>

<p>Breast milk contains antibodies passed on from the mother, which boost a baby's immune system and help it fight infections and viruses. </p>

<p>This is on top of the last three months of pregnancy, when antibodies from the mother are passed to her unborn baby through the placenta, the NHS says.</p>

<p>Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to the presence of a foreign substance, like the coronavirus. </p>

<p>The role of antibodies is to latch on to foreign substances like the coronavirus and mark it for other immune cells, such as T-cells, to kill.  Neutralising antibodies are able to kill the virus themselves.</p>

<p>The transfer of antibodies from mother to baby provides the baby with 'passive immunity'. </p>

<p>If they catch an infection, there is more chance they can fight it using the immune cells their mothers passed on to them.</p>

<p>The amount and type of antibodies passed to the baby depends on the mother's immunity.</p>

<p>For example, if the mother has had chickenpox, she'll have developed immunity against the condition and some of the chickenpox antibodies will be passed to the baby.</p>

<p>But if the mother hasn't had chickenpox, the baby won't be protected.</p>

<p>Passive immunity to measles, mumps and rubella can last for up to a year, which is why the MMR vaccine is given just after your baby's first birthday. </p>

<p>If a mother has had Covid-19, it can be suspected she will have antibodies that are passed on to the baby.</p>

<p>But it is not clear how long antibodies against Covid-19 last, with scientists saying it is evident they can wane after just a few weeks.</p>

<p>Therefore, if a women had Covid-19 in the first few months of her pregnancy, it's not clear if she would still have the antibodies for it when she gives birth.</p>

<p>Many people infected with Covid-19 in March and April don't have antibodies anymore.</p>

<p>On top of this, some people with Covid-19 never mount an antibody response anyway, because other immune cells, such as T-cells, fight the virus off rapidly. </p>

<p>Bottle-feeding can be costly for many parents struggling to cope with the financial burden of a new baby.</p>

<p>Formula milk also has varying levels of nutrients, decided by the provider, but cannot contain antibodies which are produced by the mother's immune system.</p>

<p>But there do not appear to be findings published in a medical journal or elsewhere. </p>

<p>The antibodies are not destroyed by pasteurisation - a heating process necessary in order to kill pathogens in breast milk before it can be drunk by other people.</p>

<p>This means they could be pasteurised and then made into a form of ice cream or ice cubes and given to patients suffering the infection, it is claimed. </p>

<p>Dr Van Keulen said the antibodies need to be in contact with mucous membranes - a layer of cells surrounding body organs that secrete a thick fluid protecting the inside of the body from pathogens such as viruses.</p>

<p>This is why an ice cube is the most attractive form of giving the breast milk because it needs to be sucked on. </p>

<p>Dr Van Keulen said: 'When you drink it, it disappears quickly. Our idea is to give it in the form of ice cubes, so it takes a little longer, there is longer contact with the mucous membranes to create that layer.' </p>

<p>Hans Van Goudoever, head of Emma Children's Hospital, said: 'We think that after drinking the milk, the antibodies attach themselves to the surface of our mucous membranes. There they attack the virus particles before they enter the body. ' </p>

<p>Treatments would not be available on a mass scale because of the limited quantities of breast milk.</p>

<p>But it could also be used to protect vulnerable people, such as elderly residents during an outbreak at a care home or young children.  </p>

<p>'In that case, breast milk could possibly be used for risk groups when a second corona wave occurs,' said Dr Van Goudoever.</p>

<p>'You would have to give the milk for ten days. After that, the virus will hopefully have left that nursing home.' </p>

<p>Dr Van Keulen said: 'It is perhaps a strange picture, elderly people drinking breast milk.</p>

<p>'But if it protects against a deadly virus, we should just get over that embarrassment.'  </p>

<p>The researchers pleaded for thousands of women to donate breast milk, even if they have not had not been formally diagnosed with Covid-19, in order to detect how prevalent the antibodies are among nursing mothers.</p>

<p>The response has been 'overwhelming', a spokesperson for the hospital told The Brussels Times. </p>

<p>Some 5,000 women have responded to the call to donate 100ml of breast milk in the name of coronavirus research. </p>

<p>The researchers initially said it would be 'difficult' to get responses because few pregnant women are known to have had Covid-19 infection.</p>

<p>'Women who have been infected with corona unnoticed may also have produced antibodies that can be found in the milk,' Dr Van Goudoever said.</p>

<p>'We are therefore looking for mothers who have (possibly) been infected with the corona virus, but even if this is not the case, a mother can register.'  </p>

<p>The team will now try to determine what percentage of mothers' milk contains antibodies.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether the breast milk is indeed effective as a preventive treatment against the coronavirus. </p>

<p>But Dr Van Keulen is hopeful because of information about a pregnant woman during the 2003 outbreak of SARS - a related human coronavirus. </p>

<p>She said: 'This woman became seriously infected with the SARS virus and gave birth to a healthy baby at 38 weeks. </p>

<p>'Antibodies to that virus were found in her breast milk. If you know that the coronavirus is very similar to the SARS virus - they are from the same family - then I think that corona antibodies can also end up in breast milk.' </p>

<p>Antibodies are a promising line of Covid-19 treatment because they could be used to bolster the immune system of people struggling to fight off the infection.</p>

<p>The blood of Covid-19 survivors, rich in antibodies, is already being used to treat patients.  </p>

<p>The treatment — used for around a century for other infections — works using the liquid part of the blood, known as convalescent plasma.</p>

<p>This antibody-rich plasma is injected into Covid-19 patients struggling to produce their own antibodies, with hopes it can help clear the virus.</p>

<p>Other therapies in the pipeline, such as injections, use laboratory genetically engineered antibodies.</p>

<p>Administered in doses like a vaccine, scientists say antibodies could give humans the ability to avoid being struck down by the disease. </p>
