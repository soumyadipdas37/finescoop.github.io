<p>Big day: Eric and Lara Trump celebrated their son Luke's third birthday on Saturday at Trump National Golf Club in Westchester County, New York</p>

<p>Fun times: Little Luke was photographed blowing out the candle on his dog-themed cake </p>

<p>The first photo shared by the mother of two was a family picture. In the snapshot, Lara and Eric, 36, are posing with the birthday boy, their one-year-old daughter Carolina, and their dogs Charlie and Ben. </p>

<p>They were both dressed casually for the pool party, with Lara donning a white henley shirt, light purple draw-string shorts, white Chanel espadrilles, and funky sunglasses. </p>

<p>Eric, meanwhile, wore a gray camouflage zip-up vest over a black T-shirt and shorts. Luke also had on a T-shirt and shorts to play with his friends, but little Carolina was the most dressed up in a precious red dress to celebrate her big brother's birthday. </p>

<p>Other images show Luke playing in a golf cart with four of his friends, though his cousins didn't appear to be at the party. </p>

<p>Proud mom: Lara had her phone out and ready to right before Luke blew out the candle </p>

<p>Like family! Lara's dear friend Emily Aronson as photographed holding Luke's one-year-old sister Carolina</p>

<p>While Eric's older sister, Ivanka Trump, is living in Washington, D.C. and likely couldn't make it, neither Donald Trump Jr. nor his children were in any of the photos that were shared. </p>

<p>Lara's dear friend Emily Aronson was there, however, and she was photographed holding Carolina outside the golf club's stone facade.  </p>

<p>Long-time Trump aide Lynne Patton was also at the party, and Lara shared a photo of herself posing with her while holding her two kids — one on each of her hips. </p>

<p>Message: 'Teach them young! Happy 3rd birthday to my best little boy!' Eric captioned the images of Luke on the rowboat </p>

<p>It's unclear how many people attended the outdoor birthday bash, but no one was wearing a mask or practicing any form of social-distancing in the images Lara shared. </p>

<p>Eric also paid tribute to Luke's third birthday on Instagram, though he opted to share photos from their father-son fishing trip on Sunday. </p>

<p>In the snapshots, Luke is wearing a yellow and red life vest while standing up in a rowboat. Eric is holding up a fish that they caught, and his little boy is curiously examining it.  </p>

<p>'Teach them young! Happy 3rd birthday to my best little boy!' Eric captioned the images.  </p>
