<p>As she leaned back in a plush lounge chair, Woods kept her eyes closed and propped her right arm over her wide-brimmed hat. </p>

<p>While flashing her sun-kissed legs, the 5ft9in beauty appeared to be enjoying her tropical getaway, at an undisclosed location, ahead of her birthday on September 23. </p>

<p>She cheekily captioned the image, 'b***h I am a job.' </p>

<p>At the beginning of 2019, Woods blamed her alleged kiss with the NBA player on being 'blackout drunk' and nothing more than a 'stupid' drunken mistake, an insider told TMZ.</p>

<p>The cheating scandal, which also came as a betrayal to her former best friend Kylie Jenner, ended her relationship with the Kardashian-Jenner family.    </p>

<p>More than a year after the fall-out from the indiscretion, she is 'working' and 'had a stint on a TV show.' </p>

<p>Connections gone wrong: Jordyn was previously the best friend of Kylie Jenner before she was caught kissing Khloe Kardashian's boyfriend and baby daddy, Tristan Thompson </p>

<p>A source furthered noted to People, 'She's not doing too, too much, but is staying busy.'</p>

<p>After the scandal came out into the public, the model was quick to appear on Jada Pinkett-Smith's red table talk to speak about what had gone down from her side. </p>

<p>During her appearance on the Facebook series, she admitted kissing Tristan, though she claimed that it wasn't 'intimate.'  </p>

<p>She also broke down during the interview, saying she was 'no homewrecker' and denied being that the reason Khloé and Tristan's split.</p>

<p>Tristan, who shares a two-year-old daughter with Kardashian, has never publicly addressed his side of the cheating scandal. </p>
