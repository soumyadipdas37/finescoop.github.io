<p>The events industry is currently 'starring into the abyss' due to the lack of clarity about the Government ban on gatherings of more than six people, according to the Telegraph.</p>

<p>The publication reported that events organisers are experiencing mass cancellations within the industry, which supports 700,000 employees.  </p>

<p>Jane Longhurst, chief executive of the Meetings Industry Association, said: 'It hasn’t actually defined what government is trying to do, and there’s no clarity, and it has completely shattered any confidence that anyone holding events had.' </p>

<p>If arts events were deemed against the law, the police have the powers to enforce these legal limits, including to issue fines of £100, doubling for further breaches up to a maximum of £3,200.</p>
