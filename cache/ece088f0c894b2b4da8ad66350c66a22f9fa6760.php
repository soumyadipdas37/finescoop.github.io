<p>After a number of her followers inquired about her choice to repeat one outfit multiple times, Spears provided some clarification, earlier this month. </p>

<p>'A lot of people have been saying that a lot of my posts are not new but they're old. But just to let you guys know, none of my pictures or posts are more than a month old,' she explained.  </p>

<p>'Yes, I know I did wear the same top 17 times. But it's for a project, Project Rose. And you will be seeing way more of Project Rose in the future,' she noted. </p>

<p>Britney previously referred to her personal photo project as the 'Just a Touch of Rose' shoot in an August 21 post.</p>

<p>Britney's latest post comes as the fate of her conservatorship and financial freedom has been the dominant topic among her droves of fans. </p>

<p>While Britney herself hasn't directly brought up the issue on social media, many fans have speculated that her seemingly innocuous posts – whether they display yoga and dance routines, a flowery photo project, or new fashions – betray a secret or encoded cry for help.</p>

<p>Last week, it was reported her stars' divorced parents Jamie and Lynne Spears are allegedly 'at war with each other' over what's best for her. </p>

<p>'Roses have energy fields that vibrate at a high electrical frequency': Since March 25, the Mississippi-born blonde has shared 17 depictions of the fragrant flower as well as countless rose emojis embedded in her captions</p>

<p>'Lynne wants a care plan established that would transition Britney's personal life out of the conservatorship,' a source told Us Weekly on Monday.</p>

<p>'Jamie has told her that Britney needs long-term monitoring, and he doesn't think she is prepared to take such a drastic action.' </p>

<p>Britney is reportedly more engaged than ever in the legal battle, wanting to unseal details of her conservatorship rather than keep them 'hidden away in a closet as a family secret.' </p>
