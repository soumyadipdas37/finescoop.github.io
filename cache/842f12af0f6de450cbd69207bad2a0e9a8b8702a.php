<p>A pet owner has gone above and beyond to build the ultimate dream home for her dogs</p>

<p>The Australian woman transformed an old timber crate into a miniature property</p>

<p>The woman said the old crate was given to her from a friend but mentioned she had seen similar versions sold on online marketplaces</p>

<p>'Thought we would transform an old timber crate into this gorgeous doggie house for our fur babies, complete with planter boxes and festoon lighting,' she wrote in a Facebook group. </p>

<p>'We used temp fence panels and one enclosure gate panel to make the enclosure, we sprayed them with black spray paint.'</p>

<p>The woman said the old crate was given to her from a friend but mentioned she had seen similar versions sold on online marketplaces.</p>

<p>She purchased the solar garden lights from $2 each, light up flowers, potted plants and fence panels from Bunnings.</p>

<p>The pet owner explained that the roof is attached to the crate so she can't 'lift up for cleaning' but there's another way she can access the space.</p>

<p>'[The roof] is fixed. However it's big enough to get inside if you needed too,' she said.</p>

<p>The stunning dog home features festoon lights, water tank, solar lamps and a grassy patio</p>

<p>She recycled the crate by painting it with navy blue and white stripes, attached a steel roofing on top and decorated the exterior with stunning potted flowers</p>

<p>She spray painted fence panels from Bunnings black so she could use as the enclosure</p>

<p>Her post has since been 'liked' more than 800 times, with dozens of people saying it's a great way to turn old crates into a 'beautiful palace' for their pets. </p>

<p>'How cool is this and they have their own vertical garden. Amazing,' one woman said.</p>

<p>Another pet owner said: 'Super loved and spoilt. Amazing job. I'd pay for this at my place, while one added: 'Oh that's fab very creative... lucky dogs.'</p>

<p>Many insisted the woman's dogs are 'very lucky' while others described the home as the 'best thing I've seen in ages'.</p>

<p>And one woman joked: 'Amazing! If I were smaller, I'd live in there.'</p>
