<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The nation was left shocked last week when The Bachelor's Locky Gilbert told both finalists he was in love with them - only to dump Bella Varelis and choose Irena Srbinovska as his winner.</p>

<p>And it appears the cast of Gogglebox were equally as stunned by the ending, with their hilarious reactions set to air on Channel 10 on Thursday night.</p>

<p>In a trailer for the episode, Vestal Delpechitra describes the finale as 'mental', as the other households watch in disbelief as Locky makes his gut-wrenching decision.</p>

<p>Shocked! Viewers were left gobsmacked during The Bachelor finale, as Locky Gilbert (pictured) told BOTH finalists he had fallen for them, before eventually choosing Irena Srbinovska as his winner</p>

<p>The trailer begins with Sarah Marie and Matty Fahd and their pal Jad eagerly awaiting the episode, as Matty screams out: 'Bachelor finale, baby!'</p>

<p>As footage is shown of Locky telling both women he's in love, Vestal shouts: 'This is mental, because now both girls think they're the winners!'</p>

<p>Anastasia Katselas then offers a hilarious solution to Locky's problem by suggesting he try a 'ménage à trois' with both women.</p>

<p>The screen then cuts to Di, who cackles at Locky's indecision. </p>

<p>'Bachelor finale, baby!' the trailer begins with Sarah Marie (centre) and Matty Fahd (right) -alongside their pal Jad (left) - as they eagerly await the jaw-dropping episode</p>

<p>Shook! As footage appeared on-screen of Locky declaring his love for both women, Vestal Delpechitra (far left) shouted: 'This is mental, because now both girls think they're the winners!'</p>

<p>After the Bachelor finale aired, fans expressed their disapproval that Locky would declare his love for both women, knowing he'd have to break up with one of them.</p>

<p>One viewer tweeted: 'I don't agree with his telling them both he loves them pretty silly poor girls heading for heartbreak.'</p>

<p>'To be honest - I would not want a man who was in love with another woman at the same time as me – and struggled to chose between us,' another added.</p>

<p>Hilarious: Anastasia Katselas (left) came up with a hysterical solution to Locky's problems - saying a 'ménage à trois' could be in order for the finalists. Meanwhile, Di (right) was seen cackling at the camera at the bizarre scenes she just witnessed</p>

<p>'He has no idea what being in love is!' Bachelor fans slammed Locky for telling Bella and Irena he's falling in love with them, labelling him 'emotionally immature'</p>

<p>A third agreed: 'It's not true soul love if you are in love with two women. True love is the one and only, Locky is the emotionally immature one, not the girls.'</p>

<p>'Locky is in love with the idea of being in love. Being in love with two people is not real love. He has no idea what being in love is. I couldn't be with someone who isn't solely in love with me,' a fourth wrote. </p>

<p>Gogglebox Australia airs Thursday at 8:30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Bizarre: In a confusing twist and just hours after telling Irena the same thing, Locky had told Bella: 'Babe, I'm definitely falling in love with you'</p>
