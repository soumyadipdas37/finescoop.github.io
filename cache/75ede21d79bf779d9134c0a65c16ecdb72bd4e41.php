<p>RB Leipzig cruised to a 3-1 victory against Mainz in opening match of the Bundesliga season</p>

<p>Julian Naglesmann's side welcomed back 8,500 fans who returned to the Red Bull Arena</p>

<p>Spectators were socially-distanced throughout the stands - sitting in their 'social bubbles'</p>

<p>And it took the hosts just 17 minutes to get their fanbase off their feet for the first time in months, as Emil Forsberg converted from the penalty spot.</p>

<p>Just four minutes later and the crowd were cheering yet again as Yusuff Poulsen doubled Leipzig's lead. </p>

<p>The striker rose the highest after a delightful cross from Dani Olmo as Leipzig got back to business at the Red Bull Arena. </p>

<p>At the beginning of the second period, Jean-Philippe Mateta brought the visitors back within one after some good work from Robin Quaison unleashed the Frenchman one-on-one.</p>

<p>It took just 17 minutes to get their fanbase off their feet as Emil Forsberg scored a penalty</p>

<p>Amadou Haidara got on the scoresheet early in the second half as Leipzig secured three points</p>

<p>However, Leipzig spent no time to restore their two-goal cushion as scorer of the first Forsberg found Amadou Haidara inside the box who finished coolly. </p>

<p>Elsewhere in the Bundesliga, Champions League holders and German champions Bayern Munich started their season in emphatic fashion with an 8-0 win over Schalke.</p>

<p>Serge Gnabry scored a hat-trick whilst Leroy Sane got on the scoresheet for the first time since his move from Manchester City.</p>

<p>Borussia Dortmund also got off to a winning start with a 3-0 triumph over Borussia Monchengladbach as Jadon Sancho and Erling Braut Haaland shone once again with some brilliant link-up play.  </p>
