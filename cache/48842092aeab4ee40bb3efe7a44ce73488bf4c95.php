<p>Student Anne Marie Mackey sparked a storm on Twitter after she shared a hilarious image of herself during an online college lecture, where she appeared with the accidental moniker 'big t<strong><em>y b</em></strong>h' - a name she'd used for a lockdown party in April</p>

<p>College student Anne Marie Mackey posted about her Zoom fail on Twitter - and promptly saw it go viral, with more than 470,000 people viewing her faux pas</p>

<p>Warning fellow Zoom users not to make the same cringe-worthy mistake, she penned a capped-up missive, saying: 'This is your reminder to CHANGE YOUR SCREEN NAME ON ZOOM BEFORE YOU GO BACK TO COLLEGE.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I JUST JOINED MY FIRST ZOOM MEETING LECTURE AND MY NAME CAME UP ON THE SCREEN AS 'BIG T<strong><em>Y B</em></strong>H' FROM A F<strong><em>KING ZOOM PARTY WITH MY FRIENDS IN F</em></strong>KING APRIL.'</p>

<p>After the faux-pas went viral, Anne Marie decided to back off from the storm after attracting negative comments but this morning announced she was back online, saying: 'I'm a bad b***h you cant kill me.' </p>

<p>There was reassurance that at least she wasn't the only one, as others began sharing their own embarrassing Zoom name gaffes in solidarity. </p>

<p><?php echo e('@'); ?>regcrawford3 relayed a Zoom call with a pizza face, saying: 'My wife’s boss chaired a video meeting with her face overlaid with a pizza. The overlay was so good it looked as if the pizza was talking. The meeting was about the surgery moving to digital prescriptions. The Practice Manager knew she was a pizza but didn’t know how to change it.' </p>

<p><?php echo e('@'); ?>francesthoughts disclosed: 'My kiddo (she's 8) decided to try and join her class meeting with the name "I hate my life" leading to a fun call from the teacher, school nurse, guidance counselor, and school social worker. She was just angry bc the milk had gone bad and she couldn't have her cereal.'</p>

<p>Last month <?php echo e('@'); ?>FionaLeverick had recounted: 'So today I joined a meeting with a High Court judge and Scottish Law Commission with my Zoom name as Gruntasnorus Poo Face. How’s your day going?' </p>
