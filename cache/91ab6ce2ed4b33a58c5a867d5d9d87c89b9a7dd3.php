<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The NRL has been rocked by yet another racist scandal, with Indigenous star Tyrone Peachey alleging he was called a 'black c**t' by an opponent. </p>

<p>Peachey immediately approached referee Chris Sutton following the alleged on-field slur from Newcastle Knights back-rower Mitchell Barnett during Friday night's game.</p>

<p>'That back-rower (Barnett) just called me a black c**t,' Gold Coast Titans star Peachey said.</p>

<p>Despite Peachey's claim, Barnett has reportedly told Knights club officials he did not racially abuse the former Sharks and Panthers utility, according to The Newcastle Herald.</p>

<p>Referee Chris Sutton (pictured left) repeatedly asked Tyrone Peachey (pictured right) if he wanted to take the matter further</p>

<p>On field, Sutton repeatedly encouraged the Titans lock to make an official complaint, but Peachey declined to do so, meaning the referee was unable to take the allegation further. </p>

<p>The NRL and the Knights will now launch a formal joint investigation into Peachey's allegations. </p>

<p>The Titans are also likely to follow up the matter.</p>

<p> 'It is hugely disappointing to report an alleged racial slur in that game in which Tyrone Peachey was the victim,' Fox Sports presenter Jess Yates told Fox League viewers on Friday night.</p>

<p>'It was fairly obvious to hear what was allegedly said to him. It's highly disappointing to think that still exists in our game.</p>

<p>'There is absolutely no room for any racial slur or racial abuse, and if that is what happened tonight hopefully there will be an apology from that player.'</p>

<p>Last month Penrith centre Brent Naden made a complaint against crowd members after they racially abused him during a game on the NSW Central Coast.</p>

<p>The matter was closed after Naden recently accepted an apology from one of the men. </p>
