<p>Flinders Island offers a genuine escape to nature for travellers eager to flee the rat race</p>

<p>The beef, dairy and seafood are also a big drawcard for tourists, as well as the island's natural beauty. </p>

<p>Flinders Island offers a genuine escape to nature for travellers eager to flee the rat race.</p>

<p>Adventure seekers can take part in a range of experiences from hiking to mountain-biking, kayaking and diving.</p>

<p>The high cost of flights appears to be a deterrent for many on social media.</p>

<p>'Unless the price of flights come down a bit I doubt we will be going. Family of five is a bit expensive!' one woman wrote.  </p>

<p>'Cheaper to fly to the big island, think I will wait it out until borders open,' another wrote.</p>

<p>'This would be unreal,' a third said.</p>

<p>The Tasmanian borders will remain closed to mainland Australia until December 1, meaning for the time being only Tasmanians will be able to take advantage of the flights.  </p>

<p>Flights will operate on Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays for a minimum of $480 return</p>
