<p>The Delroy family have been developing the new 'Delcado' for the last 30 years at their orchards in Pemberton, southwest WA.</p>

<p>Delcados arrived at Sydney Markets last week and will be sold at Woolworths, Coles, ALDI and Harris Farm Markets from October to February.</p>

<p>Orchard owner Russell Delroy said Delcados have 'a little more depth of flavour, a rich, almost nutty smoothness and a delicious aftertaste at the back of the palette'. </p>

<p>Avocados harvested in Australia are generally removed from the tree as soon as possible since they only ripen after being picked.  </p>

<p>But Mr Delroy's daughter Suzie, 25, said Delcados have a different flavour because they mature on the tree for much longer at 12 to 16 months. </p>

<p>'It's just quality control. They taste fresh because we keep them on the tree for longer. So, slower growing times and good temperature management results in better tasting avocados,' she said. </p>

<p>'Plus, we try really hard to get them from farm to shelf faster than anyone else.'   </p>

<p>Ms Delroy said the local Karri loam soil is high in nutrients and the surrounding freshwater is 'pristine', which allows the avocados to flourish. </p>

<p>Delcados are checked every day and the oil content of the fruit is also tested before its picked to ensure it has the right qualities. </p>

<p>Once picked, the avocados are X-rayed for bruises, blemishes, sunburn and damage beneath the skin and scanned and photographed 26 times for quality control. </p>

<p>Premium avocados are transported from farm to supermarket shelves within 12 days.</p>

<p>Avocados that don't meet the premium Delcado specifications are graded and supplied to food service, weekend markets, food manufacturers or used on the farm.</p>

<p>Hass avocados are in season from May through to January while Shepard avocados are in season from February through to May.</p>

<p>Delcado avocados will be available at from October to February, when historically the Hass variety would have to be imported. </p>

<p>The first batch of Delcados arrived at Sydney Markets last week and will be sold at Woolworths, Coles, ALDI and Harris Farm Markets in the coming months. </p>

<p>Australians consumed a yearly average of 3.81kg of avocado per person in 2018/19. </p>

<p>During this same time, 85,546 tonnes of avocado were produced, which is expected to increase to at least 115,000 tonnes by 2025. </p>
