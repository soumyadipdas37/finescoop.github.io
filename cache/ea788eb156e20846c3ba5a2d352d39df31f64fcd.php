<p>Adorable: The former Made In Chelsea star took to Instagram, where she shared the adorable footage of her baby lying in her crib, attempting to say 'hello'</p>

<p>Admitting the family have experienced their ups and downs since discovering the condition, the TV star said: 'Despite my initial fears, Sienna is doing really well in her pavlik harness for her hip dysplasia.  </p>

<p>'Everyone kept reassuring me that babies adapt really quickly, and although for the first few days she was very unsettled, she's now back to her usually smiley self and she's even started to find her voice. </p>

<p>'She coos, sings and shouts all day long which is such a delight to hear! We've been told we can remove the harness to do some tummy time and give her a bath every evening and It's the best part of my day!' </p>

<p>Adjustments: Last week, Millie took to Instagram to upload a sweet snap of herself cradling her baby girl as she wore her harness and said Sienna is back to her 'usually smiley self'</p>

<p>'She coos, sings and shouts all day long': Declaring she and husband Hugo, are 'remaining positive', the star said she's 'delighted' her little one has managed to 'adapt really quickly'</p>

<p>Update: The reality star updated her social media followers on how Sienna has been getting on in the post's accompanying caption</p>

<p>The media personality, who previously revealed full recovery for Sienna is 'very likely', added that while she's unaware of how long the tot will have to be in a brace, she and the sunglasses entrepreneur are content with her progress.  </p>

<p>She explained: 'We aren't sure yet how much longer she'll have to wear her harness, but we're remaining positive and we've been so overwhelmed by all your lovely messages and comments. </p>

<p>'I wanted to send a big thank you to everyone that shared their stories with me, it's made it all much easier to deal with as I had no idea this condition affected so many people. </p>

<p>Millie and Hugo welcomed their first child together in May, just over two years after they tied the knot at Whithurst Park in West Sussex.</p>

<p>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) occurs when the ball and socket joint does not form properly in babies and young children.</p>

<p>The hip joint connects the thigh bone, or femur, to the pelvis. The top of the femur is ball shaped and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket.</p>

<p>In DDH, the hip socket is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place. This causes the hip joint to be loose. In severe cases, it can dislocate.</p>

<p>DDH can affect one or both hips. It is more common in the left hip, as well as in girls and firstborn children.</p>

<p>One or two in every 1,000 babies have DDH that requires treatment.</p>

<p>This may include a fabric splint, called a Pavlik harness, which secures the hips in a stable position so they can grow normally.</p>

<p>If this does not work, or the child is over six months at the time of diagnosis, surgery may be required to place the ball of the femur in the hip socket. </p>

<p>Left untreated, DDH can cause patients to develop a limp, hip pain or oestoarthritis. </p>
