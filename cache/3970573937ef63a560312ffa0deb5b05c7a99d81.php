<p>'Of course you want to win some trophies for the team, for the club and for the fans. But, obviously, I'm happy with the individual trophies,' Fernandes told the club's official website.</p>

<p>'I know you can say: "Oh, I don't care" and everything, but it's always important for a player. You always feel good when you win these kinds of awards, and I am no different. </p>
