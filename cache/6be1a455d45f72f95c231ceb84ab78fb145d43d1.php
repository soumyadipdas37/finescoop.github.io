<p>We're back! TOWIE original Sam Faiers and her sister Billie were seen arriving at the famous Faces nightclub on Friday morning for TOWIE's 10th anniversary</p>

<p>Sam and Billie went for low-key ensembles as they headed to filming yet seemed to be carrying their glad rags in large bags ready to get changed inside. </p>

<p>Prior to filming, Sam insisted: 'I won't be getting involved because, to be honest, it's like I'm at a completely different stage in my life now,' she told The Sun. 'I don't even know what I would do on there any more. </p>

<p>A representative for ITV told MailOnline: 'We are grateful Sam and Billie were able to take time out of their busy schedules to participate in our special anniversary programme....</p>

<p>'They are hugely popular with the viewers and we all enjoyed laughing at old clips and reminiscing about their time on the show. Viewers can join them in celebrating ten years of TOWIE this Sunday on ITVBe at 9pm.'</p>

<p>Here come the girls! Sam shot to fame in TOWIE in 2010, with her on-off relationship with Mark Wright and her subsequent engagement to Joey Essex making her a show hit </p>

<p>Out and about: Sam and Billie went for low-key ensembles as they headed to filming yet seemed to be carrying their glad rags in large bags ready to get changed inside</p>

<p>Over and out: She was holding her undoubtedly glam look in a bag</p>

<p>Here we are: The crew members were wearing masks outside the building </p>

<p>Sam herself revealed she was returning to film retrospects, as she detailed her contribution to the anniversary after making the U-turn: 'We're not going back on to the show to film as such but we're doing the 10 year anniversary best bits... </p>

<p>'So we'll be looking back at old clips and all the TOWIE best moments.' </p>

<p>Back? Sam Faiers is set to return to TOWIE (pictured in 2011)</p>

<p>Stylish: Sam looked extremely comfortable during the outing</p>

<p>Off we go: Billie was clutching a chic Louis Vuitton bag</p>

<p>Since leaving the show, she has scooped her own reality show, The Mummy Diaries, with her partner Paul Knightley and their kids, Paul, five, and Rosie, two. </p>

<p>Her friendship with Amy Childs - who is returning for the anniversary - was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans. </p>

<p>Despite this, the girls sadly fell out when Amy left the show.  </p>

<p>Fancy seeing you here! Sam fondly greeted a show aide</p>

<p>That was then... Her friendship with Amy Childs - who is returning for the anniversary - was one of the central elements and won the hearts of many fans (pictured with Amy and Kirk Norcross in 2010)</p>

<p>Off we go: Despite her low-key look, she was rocking lashings of make-up </p>

<p>In 2011, Sam said of their now-defunct friendship: 'When she was in Celebrity Big Brother I gave her all the support in the world...</p>

<p>'I put her in my column and tweeted about her constantly. But when the last series of TOWIE started I didn't even get a text or a phone call. I feel very let down...</p>

<p>'TOWIE was a massive thing for both of us, and it would only take one phone call to show we're still friends. We're just not close any more and it's sad.'   </p>

<p>Tight! Billie looked sensational in her gym gear</p>
