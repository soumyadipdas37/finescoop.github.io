<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jude Law's 'creepy' psychological thriller The Third Day has won praise from viewers who say it's the modern equivalent to classic horror film The Wicker Man. </p>

<p>The TV drama, which premiered this week on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK, tells the story of Sam (Law), who finds himself on a mysterious island off the British coast that is cut off from civilization and inhabited by religious fanatics. </p>

<p>After trying to help a young girl in trouble, Sam arrives unplanned on the island – filmed on the real, privately owned Osea Island off the Essex coast, where stars such as Cara Delevingne have partied and pop star Rihanna has recorded music – and finds the locals are preparing for an oyster festival.</p>

<p>But things soon turn weird as the secretive rituals of its inhabitants force Sam to grapple with a past trauma, and the line between fantasy and reality fragments. </p>

<p>The eerie qualities have led viewers to compare the show to 1973's The Wicker Man and horror-drama Midsommar, which is also set at a rural festival. </p>

<p>In The Wicker Man Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is forced to confront strange pagan rituals and practices after arriving on a small Scottish island in search of a missing child who the locals claim never existed.</p>

<p>Gushing about the show, one viewer tweeted: 'The first episode of new miniseries The Third Day with Jude Law came out and it's excellent. Good surreal folk-horror that genuinely made me feel unsettled with its sound design. Just a really cool slice of bizarre cinema.'</p>

<p>A second added: 'Had a chance to watch The Third Day with Jude Law last night and I can report that it's convincingly creepy, very much along the line of The Wicker Man.'  </p>

<p>A stream of social media users admitted they're hooked on The Third Day series and likened it to a combination of The Wicker Man and Midsommar </p>

<p>A third wrote: 'Really digging The Third Day with Jude Law. Gimmie a few weeks of Wicker Man vibes and I'm happy.'</p>

<p>The series will include an ambitious 12-hour performance screened live as an extra element halfway through the series.  </p>

<p>The project is the brainchild of Dennis Kelly, the writer of C4’s black comedy Utopia, and Punchdrunk, a performance company that specialises in immersive, semi-improvised theatrical experiences. </p>

<p>The live episode, which will air after episode three with just a single camera following the actors and work in real time over the course of a day, covers the festival itself when the celebrations become more unhinged.</p>

<p>The Third Day is centered around seasonally-themed episodes and a live broadcast event set to air on Sky Arts on Saturday 3rd October. Pictured: Jude Law as Sam and Katherine Waterson as Jess in The Third Day </p>

<p>Emily Watson plays pub landlady Mrs Martin, one of the few on the island who welcome Jude’s character Sam and invites him to stay. </p>

<p>’The people believe in a religion which is basically Christianity, but shot through with some disturbing pagan elements,’ Emily told Weekend Magazine. </p>

<p>‘It’s a cult really. So Sam arrives on the island then can’t get off, which is partly his choice but partly him being manipulated and partly just bad luck. </p>

<p>'The island has this allure. People want to stay, it’s feral and extreme. In episode two there’s a rehearsal for the festival, which was great fun to film. There were explosions and bonfires and people in weird masks.</p>

<p>‘There’s a bit where Sam takes acid that’s given to him by a girl, and he’s looking at me,’ adds Emily.  </p>
