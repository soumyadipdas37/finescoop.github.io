<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A psychiatrist has told the extradition hearing of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange it is 'clear' he is on the autistic spectrum said he would find extradition 'unbearable'.</p>

<p>Dr Quinton Deeley, a consultant neuropsychiatrist, diagnosed the 49-year-old with Asperger's syndrome after witnessing a two-hour autism assessment and conducting six hours of phone calls with Assange in Belmarsh prison.</p>

<p>Assange is fighting extradition to the US, where he is facing an 18-count indictment alleging a plot to hack computers and conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.</p>

<p>Giving evidence on Wednesday, Dr Deeley, who also spoke to Assange's parents during his assessment, said: 'To my mind, it's clear Mr Assange presents as a person with an autistic spectrum condition.</p>

<p>'He's an intelligent person, he's learnt to adapt to some of those characteristics.'</p>

<p>A neuropsychiatrist told the extradition hearing WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is on the autism spectrum and would find extradition back to the US an 'unbearable ordeal'</p>

<p>Dr Quinton Deeley, a consultant neuropsychiatrist, diagnosed Assange with Asperger's syndrome after witnessing an autism assessment and conducting six hours of phone calls</p>

<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is preparing to kill himself in prison after hearing voices in his head saying 'we're coming to get you', a psychiatrist told his extradition hearing.</p>

<p>Assange, 49, had a history of depression and frequently called the Samaritans after suffering from auditory hallucinations, the psychiatrist said, branding him at 'high risk' of suicide. </p>

<p>Professor Kopelman told the Old Bailey on Tuesday he has visited Assange some 20 times in high-security Belmarsh prison, where he is being held on remand. </p>

<p>The emeritus professor of neuropsychiatry at King's College London said: 'He reported auditory hallucinations, which were voices either inside or outside his head, somatic hallucinations, funny bodily experiences, these have now disappeared.</p>

<p>'He also has a long history of musical hallucinations, which is maybe a separate phenomenon, that got worse when he was in prison.</p>

<p>'The voices are things like, "you are dust, you are dead, we are coming to get you". They are derogatory and persecutory.' </p>

<p>Professor Kopelman said: 'The risk of suicide arises out of clinical factors...but it is the imminence of extradition and or an actual extradition that would trigger the attempt, in my opinion.' </p>

<p>The professor said the combination of Assange's depression and ASD (autism spectrum disorder) has caused an 'almost obsessional rumination' on the topic.</p>

<p>Dr Deeley went on to tell the court that Assange 'would find [extradition] an unbearable ordeal' and added that he thinks '[suicide] is more likely than not [should he be extradited].’</p>

<p>It comes after it was reported yesterday psychiatrist Professor Michael Kopelman said the Australian had begun making preparations to end his own life including confessing to a Catholic priest, drafting farewell letters to his family and drafting a will. </p>

<p>The Old Bailey heard Assange refused to complete two components of the autism test, including a task to act out brushing his teeth and answering questions about his daily 'self-management' or 'self-care' routine because he found them 'demeaning'.</p>

<p>James Lewis QC, for the US government, suggested: 'It's highly unusual for people to refuse these tests?'</p>

<p>Dr Deeley, who said he has assessed hundreds of people to determine if they are autistic, replied: 'Correct.'</p>

<p>He described Assange as 'an intelligent person' who shares the characteristics of 'many high-functioning people on the autistic spectrum', including engineers and computer scientists.</p>

<p>Dr Deeley said he has 'difficulty discussing his own emotions', with a 'primary focus on his own thoughts and interests' and noted a 'failure to initiate or sustain' conversations.</p>

<p>Assange's mother, Christine, told the doctor her son as a child 'had a preference for solitary play' but made a small number of friendships in his teens with 'geeky' boys who shared his interest in computers, the court heard.</p>

<p>The court also heard Assange's close friend Suelette Dreyfus referred to his 'Edwardian style of speaking', such as talking about Coca-Cola as mead, 'like he's been reading Jane Austen novels'.</p>

<p>She also talked about Assange's 'outrageous behaviour and lack of propriety', such as moving furniture around in cafes, helping himself to condiments from another table, or going behind the bar to change the music, Dr Deeley said.</p>

<p>Mr Lewis said Assange has hosted a 'chat show' on the Russia Today television network and played footage to the court of a question and answer event where he appeared by video link at London's Frontline Club.</p>

<p>But Dr Deeley said he was talking about a topic in which he was an expert, which was not incompatible with his diagnosis.</p>

<p>Mr Lewis also raised Assange's long-term relationships, during which he has fathered five children.</p>

<p>Assange has two children with his current partner, Stella Moris, who he has been with for nine years, the court heard.</p>

<p>Dr Deeley said: 'He has had very few lifelong friends and the people who have befriended him have had to make allowances or accepted things which are generally considered to be quirky, unusual or odd aspects of his interpersonal interactions.'</p>

<p>He also told the court: 'It is true that many, perhaps the majority of people on the autism spectrum don't form intimate relationships successfully. There are a minority who do so.</p>

<p>'In Mr Assange's case, his high standing and celebrity, for some individuals would also make him an attractive figure, an interesting and compelling figure, and that likely contributes in the formation of some of his relationships.'</p>

<p>Mr Lewis told the court that Assange's father described him as 'good company' with a 'good sense of humour' while his partner said he 'could turn on the charm and entertain people'.</p>

<p>He added: ‘His mother said he has a wonderful sense of humour he is an extraordinarily selfless father.</p>

<p>‘That last comment - an extraordinarily selfless father - that alone is very inconsistent with someone who is on the autistic spectrum.’</p>

<p>Julian Assange is fighting extradition back to the US in a hearing being held at the Old Bailey</p>

<p>Dr Deeley: ‘No because a person on the autistic spectrum can be dutiful but it doesn’t necessarily mean they have an acute or nuanced understanding of the thoughts, feelings and perspectives.’</p>

<p>The lawyer claimed Assange’s family relationships contradicted the diagnosis, asking: ‘He’s maintained many long term relationship and has fathered five children, is that not inconsistent?’</p>

<p>‘Did you know Julian Assange was given sole custody to his child and he brought him up?</p>

<p>‘No court would give custody to [someone displaying these symptoms].</p>

<p>Dr Deeley said: ‘I don’t accept that. Someone on the autistic spectrum can manage as parents and function in everyday life independently.</p>

<p>The hearing continues.</p>
