<p>Posting the happy news online, Laura wrote: 'Welcome to the world!! After causing me some worry and stress with when they might come, we decided last minute to break my waters.</p>

<p>'If the contractions began, it was a sign they were ready, if they didn’t, we would go ahead with the natural Caesarian.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'Thankfully my precious girls decided it was a good day to be born! </p>

<p>'3.5ish hours from waters being broken to both being born. Molly was born in the pool and Milly was born very soon after on the bed. </p>

<p>Laura went on to share a snap of adventurer Ed cuddling one of the twins in hospital shortly after the birth </p>

<p>'Both nice and healthy and safe.</p>

<p>'I lost quite a bit of blood so I’m staying in overnight but I can’t wait to introduce Ran to his new sisters tomorrow!'</p>

<p>She went on to praise the staff in hospital for their efforts, writing: 'The nhs midwives at the General in Leicester have been phenomenal and really open to allowing me to go with my flow and assisting me where they could.</p>

<p>'So let me introduce to you; Mary Elizabeth Stafford (8.5lbs) and Camilla Claire Stafford (6.5lbs) (Molly and Milly for short).'</p>

<p>Researchers in Illinois recently used an artificial insemination procedure to, hopefully, impregnate a wolf (file photo)</p>

<p>Artificial insemination is among the slew of new reproductive medicine techniques that has come out recently.</p>

<p>Human couples who opt for the technology see specialists who use ultrasounds, blood tests or ovulation kits to check to see if a woman is ovulating at the time of her procedure.</p>

<p>A sample of sperm is then required from the woman's chosen donor; the doctor puts the sample in a catheter that is threaded through the woman's vagina and cervix before reaching her uterus.</p>

<p>The success rate for the procedure varies. The following can affect the chances a woman has of becoming pregnant thanks to artificial insemination:</p>

<p>Scientists near Chicago recently tried to use artificial insemination technology to impregnate a wolf.</p>

<p>Their hope is that the technology can revive the species, which has been considered endangered since 1976.</p>

<p>She went on to share a series of emotional photographs from the birth, including the moment she welcomed daughter Molly in a birth pool.</p>

<p>In another photograph, the couple snuggled up with their newborns for their first selfie together. </p>

<p>The couple, who are both adventurers and met while exploring the globe, fell pregnant with the help of artificial insemination.</p>

<p>They previously suffered a devastating miscarriage just 18 months ago, with Laura telling The Mirror it was 'the most traumatic thing' she'd ever been through.</p>

<p>The mother-of-three documented the experience on Instagram with a series of photographs from the birth</p>

<p>The 27-year-old shared the emotional moment she first met one of her daughters and had skin-to-skin </p>

<p>She said: 'I've put my body through hell and back on my travels, but losing my babies was the hardest thing.' </p>

<p>Laura has cycled 4,350 miles across South America and in 2018 led the first descent of Guyana’s Essequibo River.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ed set a record in 2010 as the first person to walk the 3,976-mile length of the Amazon River over a gruelling 30 months.</p>

<p>Ed Stafford walked the 4,000 mile course of the Amazon river</p>

<p>An adventurer and former British army captain, Ed may be best known for trekking the 4,000 mile length of the Amazon river.</p>

<p>He filmed and blogged his dangerous journey, where he avoided large snakes, roasted monkeys, and met people living in the rainforest, which was turned into a Discovery Channel documentary.</p>

<p>The Newcastle University geography graduate decided to walk the river after helping to run expeditions for young volunteers in Belize.</p>

<p>He had thought about being a stockbroker, after spending four years in the army, but took the position abroad with Trekforce instead.</p>

<p>The explorer now lives in rural Leicestershire with his wife Laura Bingham, who cycled across South America in 2016 to raise awareness for a children's charity, and his son Ran.</p>

<p>Ed's 2011 documentary on the Amazon was sold in over 100 countries and was translated into Mandarin, Ukrainian, Polish and Spanish.</p>

<p>He was awarded the Guinness World Record for being the first person to walk the Amazon, as well as European Adventurer of the Year and the Mungo Park Medal by the Royal Geographical Society for his contribution to the subject through exploration. </p>

<p>He has also done seven other survival series. The first, called Naked and Marooned, saw him stranded without clothes, food, water and tools on an uninhabited island for 60 days.</p>
