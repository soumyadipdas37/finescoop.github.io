<p>The outspoken British chef uploaded a video to Instagram last week of himself making a Vietnamese braised pork carbonara served with an egg yolk.</p>

<p>Mr Orr claims the recipe was an exact replica of his one of his dishes - macaroni, pig's head and egg yolk - once served at his former Rushcutters Bay restaurant  ACME.  </p>

<p>He commented on Ramsay's post, saying: 'Looks familiar mate,' which instantly drew support from the hospitality industry.</p>

<p>Mr Orr said that while chefs and cooks don't own recipes, it is 'standard etiquette to give credit where credit is due'.</p>

<p>'Gordon is one of the biggest chefs in the world with over 9 million followers on social media – the right thing to do is to credit where the inspiration for the dish came from,' told Emerald City.  </p>

<p>Mr Orr said that while chefs and cooks don't own recipes, it is 'standard etiquette to give credit where credit is due'</p>

<p>Mr Orr reached out to Ramsay's employee, chef Michael Dabbs, who was tagged in the post. </p>

<p>'I haven't heard anything from Gordon himself, but I have been in contact with the chef he tagged who agreed the [pasta] was too similar not to have given me credit for,' Mr Orr said.</p>

<p>Mr Orr closed ACME last year before going to work at CicciaBella in Bondi. He left in May and hasn't revealed what the next step in his career will be.</p>
