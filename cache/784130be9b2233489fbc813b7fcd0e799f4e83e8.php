<p>'No more tears tomorrow': Lady Gaga has revealed her grandmother urged her to make it big after the pop sensation spent days crying on the couch following her rape</p>

<p>'After I was raped, I cried on her couch for days,' she explained. 'Eventually she turned on MTV and told me to lookup. A female artist was performing. My grandmother said, "I'll let you cry the rest of the day, but then tomorrow you're going to go back out and make a real change in this world. No more tears tomorrow."'</p>

<p>Gaga has previously revealed she was repeatedly raped as a teenager, leaving her to suffer from fibromyalgia and PTSD. </p>

<p>Eventually, Gaga achieved profound success in the music industry.</p>

<p>The 11-time Grammy Award winner released her sixth studio album in May 2020, Chromatica, and last year made the transition from music to film with a role in A Star Is Born, garnering her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. </p>

<p>In addition to her career success, Gaga launched the Born This Way Foundation, a youth-oriented program focusing on mental health and wellbeing.  </p>

<p>The pop star has been open with fans about her struggles with her own mental health, and how she has sought therapy to overcome it.</p>

<p>Gaga was just as open about her battles with depression in her Oprah interview, where she revealed she nearly gave up in the throes of her mental health woes.</p>

<p>'Once I felt so depressed, I thought it was a good idea to give up. That's the worst thing you can do. I wish I'd just asked for help. But I forgive myself,' she said.</p>

<p>Now she cites dialectical behavior therapy as most important for her mental health.</p>

<p>'It's a skills-based treatment method that keeps my psyche and body focused, and balances my emotional and rational mind,' she explained. </p>

<p>'I have fibromyalgia, and although living with chronic physical pain is difficult, I've radically accepted that while I cannot think my way out of this problem, I can behave my way out of it with distress tolerance skills and routines.' </p>
