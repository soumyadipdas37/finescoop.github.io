<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's been billed as one of the favourites to win Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart.</p>

<p>But Bella Varelis has well and truly proved she doesn't get the final rose during next week's finale.</p>

<p>The brunette beauty was spotted frolicking on Bondi Beach with fellow bachelorette Bec Cvilikas this week, after the pair moved in together. </p>

<p>More pictures that spoil the end of The Bachelor: Bella Varelis was spotted on Bondi Beach with fellow bachelorette Bec Cvilikas last weekend </p>

<p>The 25-year-old stood out on the sand in a high-cut hot pink bikini that accentuated her tan. </p>

<p>It also revealed a very racy tattoo on her groin - a small heart design.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bec flaunted her curves in a white retro-style floral bikini.  </p>

<p>Pretty (hot) in pink! Marketing consultant Bella, 25, stood out in a sea of people in a high-cut hot pink bikini that accentuated her tan</p>

<p>The two women were seen gossiping away during the beach outing, no doubt chatting about their time on the Channel 10 show. </p>

<p>Later, Bella was greeted by her mother and stepfather who met up with the girls during their sun baking session. </p>

<p>The brunette greeted her stepdad with a hug, and the group later went to local sushi restaurant Raw Bar.    </p>

<p>That's a bit naughty! The revealing swimsuit revealed a tiny heart tattoo on her groin </p>

<p>Their day out all but proves neither win Locky's heart. </p>

<p>Bachelor finalists are encouraged to keep a low profile while their season airs, but Bella and Bec chose to top up their tans at yet another paparazzi hotspot.</p>

<p>And they made no effort to hide their friendship, chatting and laughing away as they put their towels on the sand.  </p>

<p>Firm friends: Bella and Bec are said to have moved in together in the area </p>

<p>Fans are convinced that Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler.</p>

<p>Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale.</p>

<p>However, it's important to note that some former Bachelor winners have remained friends with their co-stars.   </p>

<p>Hi guys: Later, Bella was greeted by her mother and stepfather who met up with the girls during their sun baking session </p>

<p>Hug: The brunette greeted her stepdad with a hug</p>

<p>Meanwhile, after arriving into The Bachelor mansion as Locky's 'angel', Bella has quickly turned into the villain of the show. </p>

<p>Fans turned on the brunette on Wednesday night after she accused her former best friend Irena Srbinovska of 'lying'.</p>

<p>The marketing consultant told the other women, Irena, 31, has 'manipulated her way through the show'. </p>

<p>Cooling off: The pair enjoyed a refreshing dip during their tanning session</p>

<p>Bachelor fans flocked to Twitter to slam the brunette's behaviour and labelled her a 'hypocrite'. </p>

<p>'If anyone's manipulating Locky now it's you Bella,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'Bella has made one mistake that gets people sent home... b**chin about another person in the house!! Bye bye Bella, you used to be my favourite,' another said. </p>

<p>Summer is almost here! The duo were taking advantage of the warm spring sunshine </p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Has Bella never seen The Bachelor because this always happens and never ends well?'   </p>

<p>'Bella embarrassing herself more as the episodes go on,' one person commented.</p>

<p>'Oh Bella, right or wrong about Irena, it's absolutely not worth it,' another person tweeted.</p>

<p>'What did you expect Bella? It's The Bachelor... You are all there for the same reason,' another said. </p>

<p>Villain: After arriving into The Bachelor mansion as Locky's 'angel', Bella has quickly turned into the villain of the show</p>

<p>Spoiler! Fans are convinced that Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler</p>

<p>Give away! Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale</p>

<p>During Wednesday's episode, Bella accused Irena of 'manipulating her way through the show'.</p>

<p>'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said.</p>

<p>'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Beep beep: After the beach outing, Bella drove away in her cream Mini Cooper, with Bec in the passenger seat </p>

<p>Dinner time: The Bachelor finalists later went to dinner at a local sushi restaurant with Bella's mother and stepfather </p>
