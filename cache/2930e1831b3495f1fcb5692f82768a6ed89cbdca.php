<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel James will emerge from his tough time at Manchester United a stronger player says his Wales manager Ryan Giggs.</p>

<p>Speedy winger James hit the ground running at Old Trafford following his Â£18million move, including add-ons, from Swansea in June 2019.</p>

<p>James scored three goals in his first four games as a United player but managed only one more in his next 42 appearances as his early-season form faded.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old started just one Premier League game when football returned after the coronavirus lockdown in June and was regularly singled out for criticism on social media platforms.</p>

<p>But Giggs is expected to hand James a starting role in Wales' Nations League opener against Finland in Helsinki on Thursday and believes he will actually benefit from his time out of the United spotlight.</p>

<p>'Dan didn't play as much towards the end of the season, but sometimes in the long run that can help you,' Giggs said.</p>

<p>'He might not like it (being out of the team) and might want to be involved.</p>

<p>'But knowing Dan, the way he trains and his attitude, he will come through and be all the better for it. You can have a different perspective of things.'</p>

<p>James was ever-present in Euro 2020 qualification as Wales reached next summer's delayed pan-European finals.</p>

<p>But his starting place was under threat for this week's double header against Finland and Bulgaria, with David Brooks named in the squad for the first time in 15 months.</p>

<p>Bournemouth forward Brooks, however, has since withdrawn from the squad with an ankle injury and James should feature in a front three with skipper Gareth Bale and targetman Kieffer Moore.</p>

<p>'I think sometimes the players that don't necessarily play all the time for their clubs, it gives them a chance to get some minutes,' Giggs said.</p>

<p>'It is a chance to try and get some form to go back to their clubs and show them what they can do.</p>

<p>'Perhaps DJ is in that camp. United start a week later, but DJ will turn up fit and raring to go, I'm sure.</p>

<p>'He has always been great when he has come into camp, he has always turned up in the right frame of mind.'</p>

<p>Wales have issues at the back with Ashley Williams, Chris Mepham and Joe Rodon all absent for one reason or another.</p>

<p>Liverpool full-back Neco Williams and Swansea centre-half Ben Cabango could both make their senior debuts this week.</p>

<p>'I am excited by these two new good talents,' Giggs said. 'There's an eye on winning the games, but also a definite eye on the summer and building for the future.</p>

<p>'First of all we're dealing with the here and now, but we also have one eye on the Euros.</p>

<p>'I've always said if everyone's fit that it will be a nightmare picking that 23 next summer, and it's getting harder with the likes of Ben and Neco coming into the frame as well.'</p>
