<p>Eifert, a 30-year-old in his first season with the Jags, played in Sunday's win over Indianapolis with Dorn's name appearing on the back of his helmet.</p>

<p>'Great win to start the season,' Eifert wrote on Twitter alongside a picture of his David Dorn decal. 'Love being a part of this new team and community! It was honor wearing David Dorns (sic) name on my helmet today!'</p>

<p>While much of the NFL honored the black victims of police violence on Sunday, Jacksonville Jaguars tight end Tyler Eifert paid tribute to retired St. Louis police officer David Dorn, a 77-year-old African-American man who was shot and killed by a suspected looter during a night of protests in June. Eifert, a 30-year-old in his first season with the Jags, played in Sunday's win over Indianapolis with Dorn's name appearing on the back of his helmet</p>

<p>The NFL previously announced in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police that players would be allowed to honor victims of systemic racism and police violence with helmet decals during the season.   </p>

<p>Other NFL players honored African-American victims of police violence, such as Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Stephon Clark.  </p>

<p>Dorn's body was discovered on a St. Louis sidewalk on June 2 at around 2:30am after he reportedly responded to a burglar alarm at his friend's pawn shop. Video of the burglary released by police showed seven suspects involved in the break-in, which occurred amid nationwide protests in the wake of Floyd's killing on May 25. </p>

<p>Stephan Cannon, 24, has since been arrested for first-degree murder in the case, as well as robbery and felony possession of a firearm.</p>

<p>Eifert, a former Pro Bowl selection with Cincinnati who has battled injuries in recent years, finished Sunday's game with one reception for eight yards in a 27-20 win over the Colts.</p>

<p>Sports radio host Tony Bruno responded to Eifert's decal on Twitter, calling him the 'only true hero in the NFL.'</p>

<p>'Much respect for the courageous stance,' Bruno added.</p>

<p>NFL player protests have been the major story of Week 1, with the Jaguars and several other teams choosing to stay in the locker room for The Star-Spangled Banner and Lift Every Voice and Sing.</p>

<p>The latter song, considered by many to be the 'black national anthem,' was played before each opening game of the new season following commissioner Roger Goodell's admission in May that the NFL should have listened sooner to players' concerns about racism. </p>

<p>'Our team is made up of many differences,' Jaguars said in a statement. 'Different races, different backgrounds, and different beliefs. Despite this, we are united by our humanity, our respect for each other, our support of another, and our common goals.</p>

<p>'We understand that not everyone will agree with our position and demonstration, however, we hope that all will seek to understand the reason for it. We all want the same thing: equity and justice.'</p>

<p>Several other demonstrations were seen around the league in Week 1. In front of a limited crowd of 17,000 spectators in Kansas City, due to the pandemic, Chiefs and Texans players were actually booed while locking arms at midfield during a moment of solidarity.</p>

<p>Dorn's widow Ann has since spoken in support of Donald Trump at the 2020 Republican National Convention.  </p>

<p>However, she called out by their daughters Lisa and Debra, who said their father disagreed with the President's policies and actually supported Colin Kaepernick, the free agent quarterback who initiated the NFL player protests as a member of the San Francisco 49ers in 2016.</p>

<p>Kaepernick and other protesting NFL players have been a constant target for Trump for nearly his entire term.</p>

<p>'The things he said about Colin Kaepernick, the kids locked up in cages, the racist remarks – these things really bothered [our father],' Debra White told the St. Louis American.</p>
