<p>Comedian: The Scouse vicar made jokes about funerals and his uncle passing away during the semi-final</p>

<p>Allan often uses his job in his act and began his routine by joking about forgetting the name of a deceased person while at their funeral. </p>

<p>He said: 'I forgot to put the deceased’s name down on my notes, I think it’s Hilda but I can’t be sure, the next minute it feels like a game of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</p>

<p>'I'd have loved to have gone 50/50 or phone a friend – I am just glad it wasn’t Deal Or No Deal, I wasn’t going to open that box for no offer.'</p>

<p>He then made a joke about his only uncle passing away after he had picked his name in a family Secret Santa.</p>

<p>Reaction: Unimpressed viewers took to social media to react to his routine, with one writing: 'Joking about death during a pandemic! Tasteless!' </p>

<p>Allan's performance drew mixed reactions from the judges, with Ashley Banjo commenting: 'You had some good moments, but halfway through it lost me, I don't think it landed and hit as much as you wanted it to.'</p>

<p>David Walliams had a more positive reaction, saying: 'Good comedians need to be memorable and you're really memorable, you're Scouse and a man of the cloth, really liked that the jokes were about what you do.'   </p>

<p>Controversial: It comes as Diversity's BLM dance set is still receiving complaints almost two weeks after their BGT performance, with TV regulator Ofcom receiving 24,041 to date</p>

<p>BGT has also received thousands of complains, with the current total at 24,041, in the past two weeks concerning Diversity's polarising BLM performance. </p>

<p>The routine, which narrated the senseless death of black man George Floyd beneath the knee of a white police officer, divided fans after it aired during the live show on Saturday September 5th. </p>

<p>The negative response has made it the second most complained about TV moment of all time, just behind Roxanne's Pallett's notorious appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, with a record 25,237 objections.  </p>
