<p>Sir Keir Starmer (pictured) will today seek to distance himself from his hard-left predecessor by painting Labour as the party of patriotism and of family</p>

<p>And he will make a plea to thousands of voters across the north of England who turned to the Tories following the disastrous leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ‘We hear you.’</p>

<p>‘I ask you: take another look at Labour,’ Sir Keir will say. ‘We’re under new leadership. We love this country as you do.</p>

<p>‘This is the country I grew up in and it’s the country I will grow old in. And I want it to be the country I know it can be. That, in the end, is why I do this. To change lives for the better.’</p>

<p>The speech is taking place on the day that would usually be the highlight of the Labour Party conference, which has been called off this year thanks to coronavirus.</p>

<p>In a speech in Doncaster, he will pledge the party is ‘under new leadership’ and that under him, Labour is now ‘serious about winning’</p>

<p>Sir Keir will say: ‘My vision for Britain is simple: I want this to be the best country to grow up in and the best country to grow old in. A country in which we put family first.</p>

<p>‘A country that embodies the values I hold dear. Decency, fairness, opportunity, compassion and security. Security for our nation, our families and all of our communities.’</p>

<p>He will add: ‘I can see in my mind’s eye the country I want us to be. Properly funded universal public services. World-class education which unleashes everyone’s potential.</p>

<p>‘A huge investment in skills and a plan, working hand-in-hand with businesses and trade unions, to create high quality jobs.</p>

<p>‘An economy that doesn’t force people to move hundreds of miles from family and friends just to find a decent job. One that truly works for all regions and nations of this United Kingdom, with opportunity and security in every part of the country and at every stage of our lives.</p>

<p>‘A country committed to a greener, cleaner and fairer society. Where every policy is judged not just by how much it costs today but by what it does for the planet tomorrow.</p>

<p>‘A country which would be an active force for good in the world, once again admired and respected leading the world - and leading by example - in tackling the climate emergency.’ </p>

<p>Sir Keir will describe ending the education gap as a ‘national mission’ and urge ministers to commit to closing it as part of the levelling up agenda.</p>

<p>The speech is taking place on the day that would usually be the highlight of the Labour Party conference, which has been called off this year thanks to coronavirus</p>

<p>‘I’m calling on the Prime Minister to make this his priority,’ he will say. ‘Bring forward a national strategy to close the education gap.</p>

<p>‘Enforce it through an independent body, such as the Children’s Commissioner, and make sure no family loses out because of the exam’s fiasco or delays in getting children into school.’ </p>

<p>In a direct message to people who have switched their vote to the Conservatives in recent elections, Sir Keir will say: ‘Trust takes time. It starts with being a credible Opposition. With taking the job seriously. That’s what we will do.</p>

<p>‘So, to those people in Doncaster and Deeside, in Glasgow and Grimsby, in Stoke and in Stevenage to those who have turned away from Labour, I say this: we hear you.’</p>
