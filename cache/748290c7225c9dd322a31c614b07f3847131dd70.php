<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A family on a kayaking trip were forced to dodge dozens of potentially deadly monkeys that had dive-bombed into the river in front of them.  </p>

<p>Cheyenne Sosebee was paddling through the Silver Springs State Park in Ocala, Florida, with her family on September 20 when she spotted marauding rhesus macaques overhead.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old had just kayaked away from the tree that the primates started to leap from only seconds later.</p>

<p>Video footage taken by the stay-at-home mother shows the monkeys throwing themselves from a tree and into the water below.</p>

<p>One-by-one the monkeys dive-bomb into the river during the bizarre display, fearlessly launching themselves almost to the opposite side of the river.</p>

<p>Cheyenne Sosebee was kayaking at Silver Springs State Park in Ocala, Florida, with her family on September 20 when marauding rhesus macaques began jumping from a tree above them</p>

<p>The rhesus monkeys, which are native to southeast Asia, carry herpes B which can be potentially fatal to humans</p>

<p>Rangers are heard warning people to 'move away from the monkeys, you don't want them to attack you' as Ms Sosebee continues to film the primates splashing into the river. </p>

<p>Around 30 per cent of the species carry herpes B, which is potentially fatal to humans, but it is unlikely to spread from the monkeys, according to WDBO.</p>

<p>Ms Sosebee said: 'Before we moved our kayak away from their tree, I was worried about them landing on us. I certainly wouldn't want them in my boat. Seconds after we moved, they started jumping.</p>

<p>'I didn't want them jumping into my boat or pooping on me. I learned years ago they can carry a herpes b virus, which can be fatal to humans.</p>

<p>'I knew they could swim but I had no idea they dive-bombed the water from the top of trees and with babies on their backs.' </p>

<p>The monkeys travel by jumping from tree-to-tree but often leap from trees into the water below to reach the other side of a river.</p>

<p>The agile primates are able to propel themselves the majority of the way across the river, allowing them to swim the short distance to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Rhesus macaques also enjoy jumping from heights and diving into water just for fun, according to the 2014 BBC documentary Monkey Planet.</p>

<p>Ms Sosebee said that she had never heard about monkeys jumping into the water before and said it was 'fun' to watch from a safe distance.</p>

<p>Ms Sosebee videoed the agile primates propelling themselves from a tree (left) and into the river below (right) to quickly travel from one side of the bank to the other </p>

<p>She added: 'I was the first one to notice them, they were running on the bank and I saw them in the trees above us, as soon as I got my camera they started jumping. </p>

<p>Rangers warned people to 'move away from the monkeys, you don't want them to attack you' as Ms Sosebee, who was with her children (daughter above), filmed the animals</p>

<p>'I'm assuming they were jumping to get to the other side for foraging. I saw them later walking around the park eating plants.</p>

<p>'I have always loved this park, so seeing the monkeys crossing was a real incredible treat for me and my family.</p>

<p>'I have never seen them jumping into the water or that many at once.</p>

<p>'I have been to Silver Springs many times since I was a kid, but was lucky if I saw maybe one or two. The monkeys are so small but them hitting the water was so loud in person.' </p>

<p>The rhesus monkeys are native to southeast Asia and only six arrived in Florida in 1938 during a failed attempt to create a Tarzan-themed attraction on a small island in the park.</p>

<p>The animals have since spread across Silver Springs State Park, which measures around 5,000 acres.</p>

<p>The primates live in forests close to water and can leap up to five metres. They are strong swimmers to enable them to access food and avoid predators.</p>
