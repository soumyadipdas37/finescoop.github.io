<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Willian jokingly told Thiago Silva that he would have turned down a move to Arsenal and stayed at Chelsea if he knew the defender was heading to Stamford Bridge, the Telegraph have claimed.</p>

<p>Silva, 35, signed a one-year deal with the Blues last month after his contract at Paris Saint-Germain expired, allowing the defender to leave the Champions League runners-up on a free. </p>

<p>News of Silva's arrival at Chelsea could've seen Willian extend his stay in west London after the winger playfully told his compatriot: 'If I'd known you were moving to Chelsea, I would have stayed there after all.'</p>

<p>Willian has joked Thiago Silva's move to Chelsea would've convinced him to stay at the Blues</p>

<p>Chelsea completed the free transfer of Thiago Silva last month on a one-year deal</p>

<p>Willian brought the curtain down of his seven-year spell with Chelsea last month to join London rivals Arsenal on a three-year deal.</p>

<p>And while the 32-year-old was one of the people he'd sought advice on over his next move, it was another Brazil international that played a key role in convincing him to join the Blues.</p>

<p>Ahead of PSG's Champions League campaign in Lisbon, the Telegraph's report goes on to claim that Neymar gave Chelsea a ringing endorsement, saying he was 'remarkably clear' in urging Silva to join Frank Lampard's side.</p>

<p>Silva also attracted interest from a number of Italian clubs, with a return to Milan also on the table, but a chat with Lampard made up the veteran defender's mind.</p>

<p>Following his arrival, Silva told the club's official website: 'I am so happy to be joining Chelsea. </p>

<p>'I am delighted to be a part of Frank Lampard's exciting squad for next season and I'm here to challenge for honours. See you soon Chelsea fans, I look forward to playing at Stamford Bridge very soon.' </p>

<p>Silva became Lampard's fifth major signing at the club after Chelsea became incredibly active in the transfer market, also bringing in Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Malang Sarr.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz has also been added to the squad, following his £89million move from Bayer Leverkusen. </p>
