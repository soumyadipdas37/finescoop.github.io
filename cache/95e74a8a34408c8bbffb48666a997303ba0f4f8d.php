<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Staff have missed the everyday spontaneous conversation of the office and the chance to learn from each other while working at home during lockdown, a chief executive has warned.</p>

<p>Lord Wolfson, the boss of high street retailer Next, warned about the damaging and 'joyless' effects of the new work environment on businesses.</p>

<p>The Conservative life peer also criticised video conference calls such as Zoom which have become vital for many companies as employees work from home.</p>

<p>He told The Telegraph that online meetings transformed 'meetings from productive exchanges of ideas into boring, one-way lectures'.</p>

<p>Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, has warned working from home means employees cannot learn from each other or enjoy spontaneous everyday conversations </p>

<p>It comes as many bosses fear that office staff will soon be back working from home within weeks due to the current testing fiasco - as supermarkets make contingency plans if workers can't get swabbed.  </p>

<p>The Government has come under fire after widespread reports of people having to travel hundreds of miles to get checked and being unable to book a test at all.</p>

<p>This is despite Ministers pledging that testing capacity will hit 500,000 a day by the end of October.</p>

<p>The test and trace system has buckled under the pressure since children returned to school and the Government made a concerted effort to encourage people back into the office in order to try and kickstart the flagging UK economy.</p>

<p>Business leaders have displayed concerns about the current testing system and emphasised that it working effectively will be vital for getting employees back to work and boosting the UK economy.</p>

<p>Matt Fell CBI, UK Chief Policy Director, said if the Government wants to encourage people into their workplace safely then the test and trace system will be a 'key component.'  </p>

<p>'Reports of people being unable to access tests in their area or waiting too long to get the results will be deeply frustrating for individual and businesses alike,' he added.</p>

<p>'No one doubts how much effort is going in to get it right. The prize is having a faster turnaround in getting results which will let people know where they stand and whether they need to self-isolate or can return to work quickly.'</p>

<p>Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told the Financial Times, the Government needed to improve the testing facility 'immediately'.</p>

<p>'A truly comprehensive test and trace programme is essential if the UK is to manage the virus without further lockdowns which will cripple businesses.'</p>

<p>'Continuing delays and a shortage of tests saps business, staff and consumer confidence at a fragile moment for the economy.'</p>

<p>Business leaders are becoming increasingly anxious that members of staff will be left self-isolating at home with family members waiting for test results to come back, rather than being back in the office during a pivotal moment for the UK economy.</p>

<p>Some supermarkets and food retailers have already put contingency plans in place if the testing system buckles.</p>

<p>There have been long queues at some Covid testing sites, such as this one in Southend-on-Sea, but others have been deserted despite people struggling to get screened</p>

<p>Brakes, a food wholesaler, who have been operating throughout the pandemic, said:  'We've got very strong contingency plans in place which include temperature checks before being allowed on site.</p>

<p>'Only essential people on site and stringent policies once people are there, which has meant that so far we have had very few people showing COVID-like symptoms.' </p>

<p>The Co-op group said that funeral care staff are on the key worker list so can get priority testing, but their food workers are not. </p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'We've built a model where we know that we have access to variable colleague resources at fairly short notice, so we have some resilience on that. </p>

<p>'Clearly we all hope that the testing capability will continue to strengthen and improve but we've got some protection in place, because the Co-op has had to deal with this throughout. </p>

<p>'It's clearly a real challenge and anything that can be done to help the [testing] situation [is welcome].'</p>
