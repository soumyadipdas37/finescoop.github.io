<p>Mum-to-be: Kate Lawler, 40, looked sensational as she stepped out for dinner in London on Monday just a day after announcing her pregnancy</p>

<p>Kate put on a fashionable display in a pale pink top and white blazer with ruched sleeves.</p>

<p>Not forgetting her accessories, Kate added a pair of brown cowboy boots and toted a large handbag over one shoulder</p>

<p>The mum-to-be tied her blonde locks back into a sleek ponytail, letting two strands down at the front to frame her face.</p>

<p>As she posed up a storm for some snaps, the podcast star placed a hand on her growing stomach and sweetly looked down at her bump.</p>

<p>Oh baby! The Big Brother star sweetly smiled as she cradled her blossoming bump </p>

<p>Kate revealed she was pregnant on Instagram on Sunday, adding that her first child is due in February 2021.</p>

<p>Speaking with Hello! magazine, Kate explained that she and fiancé Martin started trying for a baby after their wedding was cancelled.</p>

<p>Kate said the pregnancy was 'completely planned' after her nuptials were rearranged twice due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>She explained: 'The wedding got cancelled and I wasn't thinking about a baby at all.</p>

<p>Looking good: Kate looked sensational in black maternity jeans and a white blazer</p>

<p>'But when we rebooked it for the following year, a few of our friends and family said we could have a baby between now and then.</p>

<p>'I laughed, but then I turned 40 in May and suddenly I felt grown up and like I was ready for something and I didn't know what it was.'   </p>

<p>The reality star also said she had felt 'pressurised' in the past but is happy that she waited to have a child until it felt right.</p>

<p>Kate, who won Big Brother in 2002, said: 'I think I am going to be a much happier person knowing that I did this when I wanted to.'   </p>

<p>Congratulations! Kate revealed she's pregnant with her first child with fiancé Martin on Sunday, saying the baby is due in February 2021</p>

<p>During the candid interview, Kate also told the magazine doctors said she had a low egg count and this helped contribute to her being ready to become a mother.</p>

<p>The star explained how she knew the 'decision would be taken out of her hands eventually' and she was 'sad' at thinking she wouldn't be able to conceive.   </p>

<p>Sharing the news on social media, she wrote: 'Still can’t believe we’re adding another set of paws to our pack and this time it’s not another dog.'  </p>

<p>Kate previously discussed the possibility of having children last September during another Hello! interview, saying her partner of eight years Martin really wanted to start a family.</p>

<p>Love: The couple had planned on getting married on June 13th but had to rearrange to September 26th before postponing again to June 5th 2021 because of the pandemic</p>

<p>The issue became the subject of several 'heated arguments' between the pair and features as the central theme to a podcast hosted by them, called Maybe Baby. </p>

<p>Asked what would happen if Kate didn't change her mind, she revealed fears of Martin divorcing her after they tie the knot. </p>

<p>'He always said we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. And I know what that means - that we'd get divorced,' she said.  </p>

<p>Out now: read the full interview in this week's HELLO! magazine, out now </p>

<p>But the radio DJ, who presents Virgin drive time, added that Martin recently offered her reassurance with a sweet comment. </p>

<p>She told the magazine: 'But a couple of weeks ago, he said: "If you decide you really don't want kids, I'm okay with that. I would rather have you and not have children than not have you. " It was the first time he'd ever said that.'  </p>

<p>The blonde beauty also previously spoke about her disappointment when her wedding had to be cancelled after their venue closed down.</p>

<p>Posting a selfie with Martin to Instagram, she explained: 'Smiling through the sadness that our wedding venue is closing down. Absolutely gutted for The Ace Hotel in London. </p>

<p>'Covid’s been devastating for so many businesses across the world, and now The Ace, one of my favourite hotels in the city. We have such fond memories here, of dog-friendly brunches, cocktails with friends, gigs and our friend’s wedding a few years ago. </p>

<p>'Obviously we’re both hugely disappointed that we no longer have The Ace for our wedding, which was already postponed from June 13th this year to September 26th, then again to June 5th 2021.' </p>

<p>Ready: Kate said she's 'never felt more ready' to be a mum and revealed she's happy she waited until now to have a child </p>
