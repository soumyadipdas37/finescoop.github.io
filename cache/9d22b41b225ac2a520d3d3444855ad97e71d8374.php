<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Virgin Atlantic has confirmed it could axe a further 1,150 jobs from across the company taking the total number of job losses to 4,700 during the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>The company has said they are 'working closely with unions Unite and BALPA' and that a company-wide consultation period of 45 days begins today.</p>

<p>It comes less than four months after axing 3,150 roles and announcing the closure of its base at London's Gatwick Airport. </p>

<p>The company confirmed a further 400 employees left through voluntary redundancy or early retirement.</p>

<p>The announcement has been made just days after securing a £1.2billion rescue deal. </p>

<p>Virgin Atlantic has confirmed it could axe a further 1,150 jobs from across the company</p>

<p>In a statement, the firm said: 'The last six months have been the most challenging in Virgin Atlantic’s history.</p>

<p>'Even in the toughest times, the people of Virgin Atlantic are what sets it apart and they have made tremendous sacrifices.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, despite actions already taken to reshape and resize the business, regrettably the airline must go further one last time with changes at scale, to ensure it emerges from this crisis.'</p>

<p>It added that to mitigate as many cabin crew redundancies as possible, additionally, the airline is introducing a voluntary, Company-led and financed furlough scheme for an additional 600 crew when HM Government’s Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme ends at the end of October.</p>

<p>Should the Government extend its Scheme, the airline intends to continue to benefit from it. </p>

<p>The airline is calling on the UK and US governments to introduce testing regimes to help ease the restrictions on transatlantic travel.</p>

<p>The statement said: 'As the airline increases passenger operations, the opening of US borders and removal of quarantine is imperative to recovery.</p>

<p>'These travel restrictions impact on Virgin Atlantic disproportionately given its long-haul operations focussed on the transatlantic.</p>

<p>'The airline is calling for both UK and US governments to introduce robust passenger testing regimes to lift travel restrictions whilst protecting public health.'</p>

<p>It comes as it was revealed there are at least 30 countries which offer or accept coronavirus tests at airports.</p>

<p>Many have introduced systems where a negative test will either end the need to quarantine or reduce its length.</p>

<p>Some carry out testing on arrivals at the airport. Others also accept recent tests carried out before departure.</p>

<p> Countries where testing before flying or on arrival can reduce quarantine times include Germany, France and Austria</p>
