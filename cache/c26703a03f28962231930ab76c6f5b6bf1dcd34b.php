<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Forget the circus that followed Gareth Bale to the desolate surrounds of Helsinki’s Olympic Stadium, this trip represented a chance for Ryan Giggs to blood more potential Welsh heroes of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Bale, ostracised at Real Madrid and teasing a Premier League return, enjoyed a first competitive start for more than two months.</p>

<p>But the captain lasted only 45 minutes, having rubbed his thigh. Without him, Daniel James and striker Kieffer Moore combined to stretch Wales’ unbeaten run to seven matches.</p>

<p>Gareth Bale started the match but was hauled off by Ryan Giggs at the half-time interval</p>

<p>As the game fizzled towards stalemate, Moore turned home James’s low cross to settle a largely lifeless Nations League opener against Finland.</p>

<p>With his squad ravaged by injuries to the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Joe Allen and David Brooks, Giggs stuck to his promise of experimentation. </p>

<p>He handed debuts to Liverpool’s Neco Williams and Manchester United midfielder Dylan Levitt as Wales began their long run-up to the postponed European Championships.</p>

<p>Daniel James (right) impressed for Wales who were missing several key individuals</p>

<p>There were signs of vulnerability and promise in a first outing since they secured a place at Euro 2020.</p>

<p>This young squad should benefit from an extra year of experience but with the pace of Bale and James they already have enough to hurt any team.</p>

<p>Inside five minutes, James raced clear and crossed for Moore, whose header was ruled out for a foul.</p>

<p>Moore thought he had given Wales the lead after four minutes but was penalised for a foul</p>

<p>Then James’s cross-cum-shot was parried towards Bale, who couldn’t quite gather.</p>

<p>Finland did grow into the game and they had a first-half goal ruled out, too, this time for offside against Joni Kauko.</p>

<p>Only the post saved Wales shortly after the break when Sauli Vaisanen hit the woodwork from a couple of yards out, the goal gaping.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Wales, Moore made no such mistake when his late chance came. </p>
