<p>Before her death she decided to leave her estate to her former husband Vili Fualaau and their two daughters. </p>

<p>Letourneau made headlines in 1997 when she abused Fualaau when he was just a 12-year-old student while she was a teacher and she was sentenced to jail. She later married him, but after 12 years they seperated.</p>

<p>'She loved Vili to the end. She had built a life with him and he deserved to inherit what little she had,' a source close to Letourneau said to People Magazine.</p>

<p>'He got the photos, the memories, a lot of sentimental things. They didn't have a ton of money, but he and the girls are going to divvy that up. They're more interested in the sentimental things, though,' the source added.</p>

<p>Though the couple finalized their separation in August last year, Fualaau had been providing her with 24 hour care in the final stages of her life.</p>

<p>In a joint statement following Letourneau’s death the Fualaaus and the Letourneaus said they were 'deeply saddened' and shared that she died 'peacefully' after a six-month battle.</p>

<p>The insider said there will now be no controversy over Letourneau’s estate.</p>

<p>'No one is going to fight over what she had. They are all mourning her death, and they family has drawn very close together. And now everyone is going to be able to move forward,' the source said.</p>

<p>'They didn't speak every day, but she would update him on her cancer treatment,' a source told PEOPLE. </p>

<p>'At the beginning, the talk was that she was going to beat it, that even though the prognosis wasn't good, that she'd fight with everything she had, and that she had a shot of surviving it.' </p>

<p>In an interview with TODAY, her friend and longtime attorney David Gehrke said after her death that Fualaau uprooted his life to ensure he could be there to carry out that care.</p>

<p>'Vili moved back from California, gave up his life there, and for the last two months of Mary’s life he stood by her 24/7 taking care of her,' he said. 'So yes, they were divorced and they had their spats, but they were always in love with each other.</p>

<p>'He knew that this was Mary's end coming, fast moving, and for her sake and the family's sake, and for his sake, he came back up and was with her, and it meant the world to her, Gehrke said. 'And I know it meant the world to Vili, as painful as it was,'</p>

<p>'Their marriage lasted longer than most,' he continued. 'But they always, always deeply cared for each other.'</p>
