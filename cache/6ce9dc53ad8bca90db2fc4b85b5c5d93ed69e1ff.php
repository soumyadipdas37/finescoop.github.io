<p>The odd question left dozens of parents scratching their heads, due to the unusual wording of the problem. </p>

<p>Teresa Hopper from Norfolk shared a photo of her seven-year-old's question sheet to the Facebook group Family Lockdown Tips and Tricks where she asked for help</p>

<p>Taking to Facebook, Teresa wrote:  'I hate homework. Please help!</p>

<p>'Is the answer to a) &amp; b) the same or am I missing something?!'</p>

<p>QUESTION: </p>

<p>Karla says: "I have three hundreds counters, 17 tens counters and 16 ones counters"</p>

<p>'a) Can she make two equal three-digit numbers? If so, draw the counters to show them.</p>

<p>' b) Can she make two equal three-digit numbers if she had to use all her counters? If so, draw the counters to show them.'</p>

<p>ANSWER:</p>

<p> a) Yes. There are several correct solutions for a, as there are many different three digit answers between 100 and 243 Karla can create with equal counters.</p>

<p>For example, she could make a hundred counter twice, a hundred counter and a one counter twice, and so on.</p>

<p>b) Yes. Karla's counters make a total of 486. We can see this by adding them up:</p>

<p>3 x 100 = 300</p>

<p>17 x 10 = 170</p>

<p>16 + 1 = 16</p>

<p>300 + 170 + 1 = 486.</p>

<p>From here, you can divide 486 by 2 to get 243.</p>

<p>This can be made twice by adding  </p>

<p>i) Two hundred counters, four ten counters and three one counters</p>

<p>ii) One hundred counter, 13 ten counters, and 13 one counters </p>

<p>One woman shared a helpful drawing on how to solve the tricky question on the thread that left many baffled</p>

<p>Teresa added a picture of the homework which read: 'Karla says: "I have three hundreds counters, 17 tens counters and 16 ones counters"</p>

<p>' b) Can she make two equal three-digit numbers if she had to use all her counters? If so, draw the counters to show them.'</p>

<p>Teresa (pictured) later confirmed she solved the problem but it took her 'ages to get the gist' and even the teacher marked it correct</p>

<p>While it initially seems straight forward, many people were left scratching their heads, with one person asking: 'My school work wasn't that hard what they training them for Nasa?!</p>

<p>Another woman added: 'I have a PhD in maths, and I have no idea what this question is asking.</p>

<p>'Unless there's a diagram to go with it, or more explanation somewhere else.'</p>

<p>A third asked: 'How old is this homework meant for? Clearly not for a 40 year old woman, I'm lost. </p>

<p>Teresa later confirmed she solved the problem but it took her 'ages to get the gist'.</p>

<p>Her son's teacher marked the answer - yes for both - correct.</p>
