<p>Slovakian huntress Petra Krchavá, 31, from Vinica, Slovakia, revealed she is bombarded with death threats from trolls who say she should be chased down and killed like her animals</p>

<p>Forest engineer Petra has been hunting for over 13 years and the passion goes back several generations in her family</p>

<p>Despite the threats, Petra says she has spent several thousand pounds contributing to conservation efforts. </p>

<p>This money has been spent on feeding wild animals - which costs roughly £1,800 a fortnight - providing medicine, building lakes to counteract habitat destruction, embarking on litter pick-ups, and running educational programmes for young children. </p>

<p>Hunting has allowed Petra's family to become self-sufficient in their meat consumption - with every element of the animal used, leaving next to no waste.  </p>

<p>But during a hunt last year, the horror of the trolls' comments came true when a fellow hunter standing just 87 yards away from Petra was accidentally shot and died almost immediately. </p>

<p>The horrifying scene tested Petra's her strength and resolve.</p>

<p>Having first been introduced to the activity by her father, Peter, 56, when she was six, hunting has become more than just a hobby for Petra. It has become a lifestyle</p>

<p>For some time, Petra found it difficult to love hunting in the same way she had previously. </p>

<p>However, she says her determination to protect animals for future generations prevailed and so she continues to hunt to conserve and manage game numbers.</p>

<p>'Hunting is a way of life and a tradition in my family,' she explained. 'We adapt our lives to fit alongside the hunting season.'</p>

<p>'Hunting is never just about the hunt. There's so much time, energy, and care that goes into it, but most people don't realise this.</p>

<p>'People have wished me the same death as the animals I've harvested. People think we kill animals for fun ,which is not the case at all.</p>

<p>'I've been told "I hope you die like that animal," and "I wish you'd shoot each other."</p>

<p>But while the hunter claims the welfare of the animals is her number one priority she has still been attacked by trolls who say things such as, 'I hope you die like that animal,' and 'I wish you'd shoot each other'</p>

<p>Despite the threats, Petra said she has spent several thousand pounds contributing to conservation efforts</p>

<p>This money has been spent on feeding wild animals - which costs roughly £1,800 a fortnight - providing medicine, building lakes to counteract habitat destruction, embarking on litter pick-ups, and running educational programmes for young children.

<p>Petra continued: 'They don't see that I feed the animals to make sure they survive the winter. I distribute drinking water in summer and build feeding facilities. </p>

<p>'We dig lakes, give them medicine, save young and other injured animals, and organise waste collection outings.</p>

<p>'We teach children in schools and run educational summer camps. I've spent thousands of my own euros contributing to these efforts.'</p>

<p>Petra adds that hunters 'love nature' and that the practice has been a way of life for thousands of years. </p>

<p>She says that work to manage the numbers of animals and their sexual composition preserves herds for future generations, adding that she's developing her own clothing collection to raise money for an endangered species.   </p>

<p>'I'm working on my own clothing collection of which the proceeds will go towards rescuing the western capercaillie - a member of the grouse family with a declining population,' she said.  </p>

<p>After the experience of watching another hunter die so close to her, Petra stopped hunting for a period and spent time alone with nature to rekindle her passion. </p>

<p>She now hopes to continue educating young people on the benefits of conservation through hunting.</p>

<p>'I love enjoying the early morning sunrise, the birdsong, the magic fog, the silence - all whilst watching the animals,' the huntress explained.</p>

<p>'Being alone in nature with just my thoughts always seems to make my day better. Hunting has also brought me strength, courage, and some incredible friendships.</p>

<p>However, she said her determination to protect animals for future generations prevailed and so she continues to hunt to conserve and manage game numbers</p>

<p>'When we process the game meat, it's something shared by family, friends, and our village. It's the healthiest meat a person can eat. </p>

<p>'There are no toxic products used. I know exactly what happened to that animal.</p>

<p>'During the current coronavirus crisis, we've been able to be self-sufficient when the supermarkets were empty.</p>

<p>'I've had people reach out to me to thank me for what I do for nature. Adults sometimes ask me how we can pass this message on to young people too.</p>

<p>'It's important that we preserve nature for future generations. I hope I can teach my own child this one day.'</p>
