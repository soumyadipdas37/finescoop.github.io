<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid are ready to let Gareth Bale leave for a cut-price fee of £22million as they continue to try and free up their hefty wage bill.</p>

<p>Bale is reportedly desperate to leave the Spanish champions but the club are reluctant to pay off the remaining two years of his contract worth £30.2m.</p>

<p>Bale claimed recently that Real were making it 'very difficult' for him to leave the club. </p>

<p>Real Madrid are finally prepared to let Gareth Bale leave the club for a cut-price fee of £22m</p>

<p>Bale is having talks with Real Madrid head coach Zinedine Zidane over his future at the club</p>

<p>But reports in Spain now suggest that Real would be prepared to let him go should an offer of £22m be made for the 31-year-old.</p>

<p>According to Mundo Deportivo, Real head coach Zinedine Zidane doesn't want Bale at the club but the board will only let him leave for a fee.</p>

<p>Zidane is meeting with Bale this week to decide what the next steps will be. The sale of James Rodriguez to Everton for £20m earlier this week has already helped cut Real's annual wage bill down from £312m and Bale's departure would reduce it further.</p>

<p>Real sold James Rodriguez to Everton for £20m this week to help free up their huge wage bill </p>

<p>The biggest sticking point for any side wanting to sign Bale is his weekly salary, which at £600,000 a week is a staggering amount.</p>

<p>Manchester United are one side who could afford that but their interest in Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho is still active. Tottenham have also been credited with a strong interest in their former player but money would be an issue.</p>

<p>Bale did try to leave for the Chinese Super League before the start of last season but that move was blocked by Real.</p>

<p>The Wales international told Sky Sports last week that the La Liga giants haven't made it easy for him to find a new club. </p>

<p>Bale tried to leave the Spanish champions before last season before they blocked his move </p>

<p>He said: 'I tried to leave last year and they blocked everything at the last second. It was a project I was excited for but it didn't materialise.</p>

<p>'There have been other instances where we have tried to go but the club won't allow it or they have done something.</p>

<p>'So I guess it is for the club [to answer about what will happen]. What can I say? I want to play football. I am still motivated to play football so I guess it is on the club really. I can't do anything, they are in control of everything</p>

<p>'I have a contract so all I can do is carry on what I am doing an hopefully something comes up.</p>

<p>'It is in the club's hands and they have made things very difficult to be honest.' </p>
