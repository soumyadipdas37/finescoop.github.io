<p>Some like it hot! Tammy Hembrow showed off her flat stomach and super toned legs in a white bikini as she soaked up the Queensland sun on Tuesday </p>

<p>The blonde bombshell also flaunted her golden tan as she continued to soak up the Queensland sun.  </p>

<p>Fit as a fiddle: Tammy told Daily Mail Australia earlier this year that she aims to fit in the gym three to five times a week</p>

<p>'As long as I go at least three times a week, then I'm good. If I don't have time to go at least three times, then it just stresses me out,' Tammy said.</p>

<p>'I work out to keep my sanity, but between three and five workouts is usually what I do.'</p>

<p>Tammy follows a routine of HIIT (high-intensity interval training), weights, resistance training involving booty bands, ab circuits and boxing.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur got fans' attention when she announced on Instagram that she was going vegan for 2020.</p>

<p>But like others who make the switch, she admitted that it's been quite challenging.</p>

<p>'I was trying [vegan]. I lasted a little while but now fish is back in my diet,' she said.</p>

<p>'I don't really eat chicken or meat, it's mainly fish and vegetables. Hopefully I can go fully plant-based.' </p>
