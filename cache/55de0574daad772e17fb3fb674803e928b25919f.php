<p>And it is easy to see why stunning Sunshine Coast beauty Bec Cvilikas leaves Locky Gilbert and the other girls seething when she is introduced via Zoom on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old stuns, showing off her slender figure and angelic good looks in a promotional image posted on her Instagram page.</p>

<p>No wonder they are threatened! New Bachelor intruder Bec Cvilikas stuns in promotional photo as she is dubbed 'the most beautiful person to ever be on the show'</p>

<p>Bec, who is lives in Sydney but hails from QLD wears a flirty wrap around top in the photo that shows off a hint of her toned torso.</p>

<p>Thought I’d pop in and see what all the fuss is about ���� Catch me 7.30 tonight on #thebachelorau on <?php echo e('@'); ?>channel10au,' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>According to Bec, the blonde beauty instantly shares intense chemistry with Locky. </p>

<p>'The second Locky and I connected on the screen, there was this instant spark. You couldn't have wiped the smile off our faces if you tried!' Bec told TV Week this week.</p>

<p>'Some of the girls are definitely taken aback by how strong our connection is in such a short time I mean, even I am!' she continued.</p>

<p>Bec describes herself as 'a bit of a tomboy' having played rugby for years.</p>

<p>'I don't know if the other girls are jealous, but if it was the other way around, I'd be feeling protective over my connection as well,' she added.</p>

<p>In a teaser trailer for this week's episodes, host Osher Günsberg tells the remaining ladies another woman has entered the competition via video link.</p>

<p>'She's frickin amazing!' an excited Locky gushes in a piece-to-camera. 'All the boxes are being ticked.'</p>

<p>But while Bachelor Locky is thrilled about the new arrival, fellow suitor Izzy Sharman-Firth describes the newcomer as a 'kick in the d**k'.</p>
