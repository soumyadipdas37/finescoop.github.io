<p>The beauty has long been the subject of surgery rumours, however, she has seldom spoken of her possible use of cosmetic injectibles. </p>

<p>All natural: Tammy has repeatedly denied speculation she has had a Brazilian butt list in order to attain her shapely derrière. Here: 2020</p>

<p>'Miss Hembrow is the quintessential Instagram model for our social media world where fake is the new real,' Dr Haworth said. </p>

<p>'As attractive as she is, she sits alongside countless other online influencers that have been matriculated in the Kardashian-Jenner School of Beauty.' </p>

<p>The celebrity surgeon went on to claim that the Queensland-based mother-of-two looks strikingly different in her celebrity photos compared to images of her taken several years ago. </p>

<p>'Miss Hembrow is the quintessential Instagram model for our social media world where fake is the new real': Dr Randal Haworth claimed that Tammy looks strikingly different in recent photos compared to images of her taken several years ago.

<p>'Based on what I presume to be filtered photos, she has undergone a striking transformation of not only her facial features but also of her facial shape,' Dr Haworth claimed.    </p>

<p>He added: 'Specifically, her jawline is more defined into a "V-line". I would even venture to say her chin has been shortened and narrowed compared to her teenage years.'</p>

<p>Dr Haworth also believes her V-line chin could have been achieved through either 'liposuction or bony chin modification'.</p>
