<p>A dating app that lets women make the first move is planning to go public in a float worth up to £6billion.</p>

<p>Bumble is looking at listing on the New York Stock Exchange early next year, according to reports. </p>

<p>It would be the latest in a string of technology floats over the last couple of years – which have included Uber, Lyft and Pinterest.</p>

<p>Bumble allows users to set up a profile and see the profiles of other singletons nearby.</p>

<p>Users can swipe left if they aren’t interested in someone, and right if they are. </p>

<p>But what makes Bumble different is that once two people swipe right and match with one another, women have to initiate the conversation.</p>

<p>Founded in 2014 by Whitney Wolfe Herd, who previously co-founded the first mainstream dating app Tinder, it was set up like this to give women more control after some reported feeling harassed on other dating apps.</p>
