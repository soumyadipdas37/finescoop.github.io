<p>Star midfielder Brad Crouch and his teammate forward Tyson Stengle were stopped by police in the Adelaide CBD early on Monday morning.</p>

<p>They avoided any criminal charges but will likely face sanctions from the football club, the AFL or both.</p>

<p>Star midfielder Brad Crouch (pictured with coach Matthew Nicks) and his teammate were stopped by police in the Adelaide CBD early on Monday morning</p>

<p>Stengle, 21, was already in hot water after allegedly being caught drink driving at 0.125 blood alcohol level in April.  </p>

<p>Adelaide football manager Adam Kelly said the pair would be 'counselled' and given appropriate support'.</p>

<p>'First and foremost the alleged conduct is serious and we will continue to ask questions and make sure we have all of the facts before settling on a definitive position going forward,' he said.</p>

<p>'The club will also liaise closely with the AFL and AFL Players' Association during this process including working through any consequences under the AFL's illicit drug policy.</p>

<p>Tyson Stengle was also stopped by police at the same time and was already in hot water after allegedly being caught drink driving at 0.125 blood alcohol level in April</p>

<p>'What is absolutely clear is that all players across the league are well educated about drug use and relevant policies.</p>

<p>'As an organisation we take a very strong stance against any behaviour of this kind.</p>

<p>'The wellbeing of Brad and Tyson is also paramount and we will make sure they receive appropriate support.'</p>
