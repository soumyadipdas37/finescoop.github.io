<p>Honest Biebs: Justin recently vowed to give up his 'selfish desires' every day in order to be a 'good husband and future dad'. The 26-year-old singer took to Instagram to reflect on his past and admitted that growing up in the spotlight as a teenager meant his 'insecurities and frustrations' were dictated by what he valued in life at the time and his 'ego and power' destroyed his relationships</p>

<p>The 'As Long as You Love Me' hitmaker explained that he's now 'motivated by truth and love' and what he values in life has changed.</p>

<p>He wrote alongside a studio snap of himself: 'I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada. I didn't have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music. But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in. </p>

<p>'My values slowly started to change. Ego and power started to takeover and my relationships suffered because of it. I truly desire healthy relationships. I want to be motivated by truth and love. I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them! I want to walk in the plans God has for me and not try and do it on my own! I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad! I'm grateful that I can walk with Jesus as he leads the way.'</p>

<p>Justin's vow to focus on being the best husband and father one day comes after sources claimed the topic of becoming parents has become a 'very real conversation' for the couple.</p>
