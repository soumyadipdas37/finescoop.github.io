<p>'Once I asked and got approval from her dad, I had to because he was my friend, I thought "I can't stuff this up". So I have to do what I can.'</p>

<p>Funny story: Pete replied: 'It was just foolish and I don't know, I think in my thirties, I think I was having a mid-life crisis. I really do. In my forties, I just wouldn't do that now.'</p>
