<p>The Britain's Got Talent judge recently spoke on the show's controversy regarding Diversity's dance performance about Black Lives Matter and police brutality.</p>

<p>Ofcom complaints have soared to 23,308 over the performance which featured a portrayal of a policeman kneeling on Ashley Banjo's neck. </p>

<p>On Good Morning Britain this week, Amanda said: 'It is extraordinary. I think the number of negative complaints means this conversation is right and fundamental and should continue to happen.</p>

<p>'What hasn't really been highlighted is the fact that we were inundated with overwhelming positive response, hundreds of thousands of them. </p>

<p>Sensational style: Amanda sheltered her eyes with a pair of stylish tortoiseshell shades and wore gold hoop earrings with a dangling pendant</p>

<p>'As BGT family, and Diversity is very much part of that family, and Ashley is doing a phenomenal job on BGT, we stand by him and stand by that performance 100 per cent.'</p>

<p>The star added of Ashley Banjo: 'He sends out positive vibes to both the haters and the lovers of the piece that they did. He is saddened by negativity.' </p>

<p>Presenter Piers Morgan, 55, reiterated his support for the routine saying: 'If you can't handle that without feeling the need to never watch BGT again or to complain to Ofcom, there's something wrong with you. </p>

<p>'You, you're the problem! You're part of the problem.</p>

<p>'By the way, if you don't like me saying this, then don't watch us either. Don't watch Good Morning Britain. Because I agree with Ashley Banjo and Diversity. And if you can't handle it Britain, wake up.'  </p>
