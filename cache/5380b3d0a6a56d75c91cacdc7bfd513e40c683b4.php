<p>Ha! Alison Hammond is up to her cheeky antics once again in her appearance on the first episode of Ainsley Harriott's new ITV show Ainsley's Food We Love</p>

<p>Alison appeared delighted to be showcasing her culinary skills on the show, during which Ainsley asked what her favourite kind of holiday is. </p>

<p>She replied: 'I like the type of holiday where you really explore the culture. I'm not a beach person but I'm more of a pool person...</p>

<p>'I want to meet the people of the environment. If I go to Florida, I want to meet people from Florida. If I go to Tunisia, I want to meet the Tunisians'.</p>

<p>She then went in to detail about the very starts of her showbiz career - before her stint on Big Brother's third series in 2002. </p>

<p>So it begins! In the show, which debuts on Saturday, the Big Brother star, 45, was cooking up a Tunisian cous cous and during the demonstration she told Ainsley how she accidentally got a job as a kids' entertainer during a trip to Tunisia</p>

<p>That was then! She told the hilarious story (pictured in June last year)</p>

<p>Alison said: 'I love Tunisia. It's one of my favourite places to go. I went there with my friend and the entertainer in the hotel had left...</p>

<p>'The next thing i know Ainsley, I'm on the stage on my holidays entertaining the kids doing mini disco, singing I Am The Music Man, the kids loved it!...</p>

<p>'The manager came up and asked if I want to get a job and I didn't have a job at the time. So you never know - by going on that holiday I wound up in that sort of career. That's how I got that kind of career!'</p>

<p>Ainsley then pointed out: 'You never know what's around the corner!'</p>

<p>Way back when: She then went in to detail about the very starts of her showbiz career - before her stint on Big Brother's third series in 2002</p>

<p> She said of the series: 'There's exciting things coming up.'</p>
