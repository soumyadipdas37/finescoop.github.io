<p>Indeed the sister of Kim and Khloe Kardashian did slightly resemble an alien emoji as her hair was slicked back and she had on heavy eye makeup that gave her a cat-eye look.</p>

<p>Her expression was also flat with zero human expression.</p>

<p>This comes after a report she has not reunited with ex Scott Disick. </p>

<p>While the KUWTK star and her former partner of nine years, 37, have been spending more time together since he called it quits from Lionel Richie's 21-year-old daughter Sofia last month, sources claim the friendly exes will never reunite.</p>

<p>From planet Kardashian! 'Greetings earthlings,' was all the mother of three said in her brief caption</p>

<p>The insider added that they are maintaining a healthy co-parenting relationship for the sake of their children Mason, 10, Penelope, eight, and Reign, five.</p>

<p>They told TMZ: 'They're are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia. </p>

<p>'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both. </p>

<p>'The kids had a blast [during their recent trip to Lake Coeur d'Alene in Idaho] and Scott and Kourtney realised it's good for the fam and they want to do more of it.'</p>

<p>Not going back: This comes after a report she has not reunited with ex Scott Disick .

<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Kourtney and Scott for further comment. </p>

<p>They dated from 2005 until 2010, with the media personalities splitting due to Scott's issues with alcohol misuse. </p>

<p>The pair reconciled in mid-2010 after the birth of their first child Mason, before splitting for good in five years later following claims of cheating on his part.</p>

<p>The lifestyle blogger went onto date male model Younes Bendjima, 27, from late 2016 until August 2018, while Scott started his romance with Sofia in May 2017. </p>

<p>The father-of-three even left a flirty comment on one of his ex's radiant swimsuit images from their recent glamping trip.</p>

<p>Just weeks earlier, a source alleged Scott and Sofia were 'easing back into a relationship' following his rehab stint.  </p>

<p>They said: 'Scott and Sofia never lost touch while spending time apart, but have been seeing each other more often recently. They have hung out a handful of times in the last couple of weeks and are slowly easing back into a relationship. </p>

<p>'It feels totally back to normal from how things were before Scott went to rehab, but they've decided they don't want to put pressure on the status of the relationship.'</p>

<p>They are no longer on talking terms, with an insider recently telling E! News: 'They have been off and on for two months.</p>

<p>'Sofia really pushed to make things work between them after they initially broke up, but Scott officially called it off recently and they are no longer speaking. Friends attributed their 15-year age difference becoming an issue.</p>

<p>'He's in a very much different place in his life, really focused on a more quiet lifestyle, his kids and his investment businesses. And Sofia, at 21 years, really still trying to figure what she wants to do which drove them apart over time.'</p>
