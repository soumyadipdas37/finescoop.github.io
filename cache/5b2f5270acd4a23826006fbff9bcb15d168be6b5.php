<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There may be an almost 40-year-age gap between them, but Dennis Quaid and his much younger wife Laura Savoie appear to be perfectly in sync with one another.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the newly-married couple were pictured on a casual outing together in Los Angeles, as they arrived at a friend's house both showing off their trim frames.</p>

<p>Inner Space star Dennis, 66, looked slim in a tight-fitting navy blue T-shirt and grey jeans, while Laura, 27, showed off her athletic figure in black skintight running gear.  </p>

<p>In sync! Dennis Quaid, 66, and new wife Laura Savoie, 27, both show off their trim frames while arriving to a friend's house in Los Angeles on Monday </p>

<p>Despite his older years, Dennis still appears to be in great shape, and no doubt being a busy father has kept him on his toes. </p>

<p>The actor has three children, Jack, 28, - from his marriage to Meg Ryan, 58, (1991-2001) and twins Thomas and Zoe, 12, from his marriage to Kimberly Quaid, 48, (2004-2018). </p>

<p>Dennis was also married to his first wife, American actress P.J. Soles from 1978 to 1983. </p>

<p>Keeping fit: Dennis looks to be in good shape, proving that he can still keep up with his much younger wife </p>

<p>Meanwhile Dennis and Laura have faced plenty of criticism during their whirlwind romance, which started last May, mostly over their nearly 40-year age difference.</p>

<p>Quaid told the Today Show last month: 'There's 30-something years between us, and we just don't even notice it. I've never related to someone in my life better than we do.</p>

<p>'We have such a great relationship and you know, love finds a way, wherever it is. You never know when love is coming, who it's gonna be, and you have no control over it. We just couldn't be happier.' </p>

<p>Keeping up the Quaids: The married couple appear to be leading an active lifestyle </p>
