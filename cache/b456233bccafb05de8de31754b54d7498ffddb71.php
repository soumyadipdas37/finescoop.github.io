<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victorians may have finally had enough. </p>

<p>Less than two weeks after a poll found the majority supported Daniel Andrews' lockdown measures, most now say it's time to ditch three key restrictions the premier continues to impose. </p>

<p>The latest Roy Morgan survey results released on Thursday found 61 per cent believe they should be allowed to travel more than 5km from their homes.</p>

<p>Some 56 per cent want Melbourne’s restaurants, pubs, cafes and clubs to open inside dining with social distancing - up 19 per cent from a survey three weeks ago. </p>

<p>Melburnians say it's time to get rid of restrictions and let them travel more than 5km from their home, visit immediate family and have hospitality venues with indoor dining. Pictured: Residents exercising in Melbourne</p>

<p>A surprising new poll has revealed that the majority of Victorians want to ditch Premier Daniel Andrews' restrictions just days after data found the state supported his strict lockdown</p>

<p>Nearly 60 per cent want to be able to visit their families - a rise of 4 per cent from three weeks prior. </p>

<p>The Roy Morgan survey results also found approval ratings for Premier Andrews had dropped nine points to 61 per cent.</p>

<p>He still has high approval ratings among Labor supporters with 89 per cent approval, and the Greens, with 80 per cent. </p>

<p>Daniel Andrews celebrates his re-election in November 2018. An unnamed MP said the Victorian Labor leader is an 'election-winning machine'</p>

<p>A separate poll for The Australian published on September 21 found 62 per cent of Victorian voters agreed the premier has managed the crisis well, despite the hotel quarantine bungle that sparked the second wave. </p>

<p>Separately, 61 per cent of voters around Australia, including 57 per cent of Coalition voters, said the restrictions which locked Victorians at home and prevented them from travelling interstate, were appropriate. </p>

<p>Mr Andrews is facing growing criticism within his party over the state's COVID-19 response with numerous calls to resign in the wake of the pandemic.</p>

<p>However, sources say with no alternative leader banging on the door he is unlikely to be challenged for the top job.</p>

<p>Health Minister Jenny Mikakos sensationally resigned from her position on Saturday after Mr Andrews told an inquiry she was 'accountable' for the state's doomed hotel quarantine program which has been linked to numerous deaths.  </p>

<p>Ms Mikakos is the fourth minister the under-fire premier has lost in barely three months - after three other high-ranking Labor politicians were stood down or sacked over branch-stacking allegations which emerged in June.</p>

<p>The premier's list of detractors in the party is growing according to sources - particularly in Victorian Labor's right-wing faction - who believe he threw Ms Mikakos under the bus over the crisis, but he is likely to survive the pressure.</p>

<p>Ms Mikakos resigned from parliament altogether and took a parting swipe at the premier as she claimed in a statement her integrity had been 'undermined'. </p>

<p>Mr Andrews won re-election as Victorian premier in November 2018 in a landslide victory, but a MediaReach poll earlier this month said the Liberals were now well ahead with 61.2 per cent of the vote on a two party-preferred basis.</p>

<p>Earlier on Tuesday, it emerged the taxpayer-funded budget for the inquiry into Victoria's bungled hotel quarantine program had blown out to $5.7million.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews has approved an extra $2.7million to the inquiry board, on top of the $3million originally allocated by the Victorian government.</p>

<p>Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos stepped down from her role on Saturday after Mr Andrews said she was 'accountable' for hotel quarantine in the state. A Labor source said there is anger due to the belief he threw Ms Mikakos under the bus over the crisis</p>

<p>Up to 56 per cent of people surveyed this week said it was time for businesses in the coronavirus-stricken city to open inside dining, the latest Roy Morgan results found</p>

<p>So far, 794 Victorians have died and five million Melburnians have been forced to endure weeks of Stage Four lockdown.</p>

<p>The inquiry heard of that total, 768 had died because of outbreaks at the botched hotel quarantine program responsible for the state's deadly second wave of cases.</p>

<p>The inquiry is now sifting through the final submissions and more than 200,000 documents after six weeks of hearings ended last week. </p>

<p>The inquiry's final findings will be handed down November 6.</p>

<p>The public hearings have already been slammed by some commentators and Victorians, after it did not find the person responsible for allowing private security guards to work in the hotels.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four deaths on Wednesday, bringing down the 14-day average to 16.4 in Melbourne and 0.3 in regional Victoria. </p>

<p>Victorians surveyed were each asked the following questions to determine their attitudes towards the current Victorian Government Stage 4 directives:</p>
