<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A veteran snake catcher has been left stunned after discovering a giant curled-up carpet python concealed underneath a suburban garden bin. </p>

<p>The python was found under a green wheelie bin by Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers wrangler Stuart McKenzie - who said the serpent was 'double the size of what I was thinking'.</p>

<p>The snake catcher warned homeowners to be wary of a small gap underneath their backyard bins, but said even he was shocked to discover the actual size of the python at a home in the Sunshine Coast suburb of Nambour.</p>

<p>'Holy! Look at the size of it! That is double the size of what I was thinking,' he said in footage filmed in the home's courtyard.</p>

<p>Stuart McKenzie and his team relocated an enormous carpet python (pictured) underneath a garbage bin in Nambour</p>

<p>You'll never want to take the trash out again: 'Holy! Look at the size of it! That is double the size of what I was thinking,' Mr McKenzie said in footage filmed in the home's courtyard</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie brought a pillow case with him in the hope of using it to snare the python but knew it would be insufficient for the task once he discovered the task at hand.</p>

<p>Despite him holding up the snake to reveal it was even longer than him, the resident who first made the discovery said she 'wasn't even frightened' of the huge animal.</p>

<p>'This is one of the biggest carpet pythons I've caught in years! As you can tell, I was pretty stoked,' Mr McKenzie wrote as he shared his find on the Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 Facebook page.</p>

<p>'He was taken a good distance away [from the home] to live a longer life and hopefully not scare anymore old ladies!'</p>

<p>'I’m going to be terrified taking the bins out from now on,' one social media user wrote in response to the video.</p>

<p>'Absolutely beautiful! I can’t believe that snake fit under the wheelie bin,' another wrote. </p>

<p>Mr McKenzie held up the snake to reveal it was even longer than him, but the resident who first made the discovery said she 'wasn't even frightened' of the huge animal</p>

<p>The clip has been shared almost 7,500 times and has more than 6,700 likes since first being posted on Monday.</p>

<p>Although carpet pythons are non-venomous to humans, their bite can still cause significant damage including severe punctures and lacerations.</p>

<p>The Queensland snake catcher on Monday issued a warning to the public after capturing a huge red belly after it slithered through a school.</p>

<p>Stuart McKenzie (pictured) caught this huge red belly black snake from the back of a school on the Sunshine Coast on Friday</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie told Daily Mail Australia he had seen a number of large adult snakes on the move through the Sunshine Coast region.</p>

<p>'It's been hectic,' Mr McKenzie said. 'It's that time of year. All the big adult snakes are out and about and mating and all the boys are fighting each other.'</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie was called to relocate an enormous red belly black snake on Friday after it snuck its way through the playground to the back of a school. </p>

<p>'It was very big for a red belly,' he said. 'A good four-and-a-half to five foot and fat and chunky.</p>

<p>'The teachers did a great job of keeping the kids away.'</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie estimated the snake was around eight-years-old and among a wealth of elder snakes travelling about on the Sunshine Coast lately.</p>

<p>'Everyone's coming out to play,' he said.</p>
