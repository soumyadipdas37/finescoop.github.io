<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A boisterous Trump supporter wearing a MAGA hat in downtown Kenosha called police to drive him home Tuesday after getting into a fight with a crowd of protesters who ordered him to 'get the f**k out of the park,' hours after the president left town.</p>

<p>The fight broke out at 5:30pm in Civic Center Park, across from the county courthouse.</p>

<p>A former U.S. Marine named David, who refused to give his last name because he fears he'll be targeted, was at the park earlier in the day leading chants among scores of Trump supporters who were facing off against Black Lives Matter protesters during the president's visit. </p>

<p>He described them as 'the true criminals' in America.</p>

<p>A Trump fan in a white MAGA cap shoved by a Black Lives Matter protester, then threw a punch</p>

<p>The two men brawled in front of the cameras on Tuesday evening after Trump's visit</p>

<p>David's side went home, but he stuck around and got into a heated argument with the remaining protesters in a spectacle that played out before news crews in town covering Trump. </p>

<p>David was shoved by a Black Lives Matter protester, then threw a punch. </p>

<p>He then got clocked in the face, thrown to the ground and pummeled by protesters who kicked him while he was down. </p>

<p>Some demonstrators intervened to stop the fight, then protected David as others chased him down the street while heckling him.</p>

<p>'Keep f**k'g walking, go home,' one shouted on a megaphone. </p>

<p>'Walk faster, go home. F<strong>k you. F</strong>k Donald Trump.'</p>

<p>David ended up with cuts and bruises after the encounter on Tuesday evening</p>

<p>David was escorted out of the park in central Kenosha after the scrap on Tuesday</p>

<p>Black Lives Matter supporters were out in force on Tuesday, ahead of Trump's visit</p>

<p>Police then drove David home following the scuffle in Kenosha</p>

<p>David, his hat off, eye swollen and neck bleeding, rounded a corner where he spoke with reporters.</p>

<p>'I was trying to have a conversation with them,' he said. </p>

<p>'You can obviously see from the way they're chanting and the things they say that they were just looking to beat up any white guy with a MAGA hat.</p>

<p>'These are Maoist terrorists,' he added. </p>

<p>'They are not Americans. They are not liberals. They are Maoists, and they will attack you, they will hurt you, they want to burn down this United States. Even if Joe Biden wins, they will not stop. Don't you understand me?'</p>

<p>A medic came to treat his eye, telling him to see a doctor. Then another Black Lives Matter protester approached.</p>

<p>David said he felt threatened and called Kenosha police to escort him home.</p>
