<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian jobs have been decimated during the COVID-19 crisis, but a bonanza of work could soon be on the way for those with a trade, as infrastructure spending soars.</p>

<p>The NSW government is hoping to cut a 50/50 deal with Canberra to fund the construction of Sydney's proposed Western Harbour Tunnel - a move which could create thousands of full-time jobs.  </p>

<p>NSW Transport Minister And­rew Constance has hinted that Scott Morrison may look to announce the mega project in next month's federal budget, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>Australian jobs have been decimated during the COVID-19 crisis, but for those with a trade, a bonanza of work could soon be on the way as infrastructure spending soars</p>

<p>'It can generate 15,000 jobs which is critical to our economic future,' NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance said.  </p>

<p>'I'm keen for the feds to have a close look at it.</p>

<p>'This will be the biggest road project of the 2020s in terms of impact and I'm keen for Canberra to help us.'  </p>

<p>The 6.5km tunnel would link Rozelle in Sydney's inner west to the Warringah Freeway on the Northern Beaches - bypassing the CBD, Harbour Bridge and easing congestion on the ANZAC Bridge.</p>

<p>About 7,500 full-time would be created during the construction of the Western Harbour Tunnel and Warringah Freeway upgrade, which spans another 4km.</p>

<p>When combined with the proposed Beaches Link, there should be 15,000 jobs for tradespeople on offer.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Sydney, the construction of the Harbour city's second airport at Badgerys Creek is poised to stimulate a projected 200,000 jobs by the time it's up and running in 2026. </p>

<p>For workers in Queensland, another mammoth construction project is preparing to ramp up.</p>

<p>The Cross River Rail, worth about $6.8billion, is the state's largest-ever infrastructure project.</p>

<p>The 10.2km rail line, which is already under construction, will run from Dutton Park to Bowen Hills and includes 5.9km of twin tunnels that will go under the CBD and Brisbane River.</p>

<p>Tradespeople and contractors looking for work on the project can go to the government's website to apply. </p>

<p>The project is set to be completed in 2024. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Perth's massive rail development METRONET is also shaping up to be a windfall for workers. </p>

<p>The New South Wales government is hoping to cut a 50/50 deal with Canberra to fund the construction of Sydney's proposed Western Harbour Tunnel</p>

<p>'Perth will have six METRONET projects under construction at once, creating thousands of local jobs and opportunities for local businesses,' Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan said.</p>

<p>'The TCL will connect two of Perth's train lines for the first time – the first time we will have a east-west connection between rail lines on our network.'</p>

<p>Details about how to land work on the METRONET are available at the organisation's website.</p>

<p>But perhaps the city in most need of a jobs resurgence is the coronvirus-hit Victorian capital.</p>

<p>Melbourne's $11billion Metro Tunnel project began in 2018 but is not due to be completed until at least 2025.</p>

<p>Up to 7,000 jobs will be created by the 9km twin rail tunnels connecting five new underground stations.</p>

<p>Hundreds of those positions will also include apprentices and trainees. </p>

<p>Job hopefuls can apply at the government website for a role on the project. </p>

<p>The Western Harbour Tunnel 'can generate 15,000 jobs which is critical to our economic future,' NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance said</p>
