<p>Happy couple: Charles Dance, 73, and his Italian producer girlfriend Alessandra Masi, 53, soaked up the late summer heatwave while strolling around London on Monday</p>

<p>Alessandra mirrored her partner's style in a navy spaghetti-strap top and baby pink floral shorts, teamed with trainers and a black leather satchel bag. </p>

<p>The couple looked happy and relaxed in each other's company as they shopped for fresh fruit and vegetables, before cooling off with a refreshing drink during a sweltering day in the capital.</p>

<p>Charles and Alessandra we seen kissing as they enjoyed a day at the beach during a break from Venice Film Festival events earlier this month. </p>

<p>The pair are believed to have met in 2018 when he acted in art movie The Book Of Vision, on which Alessandra was the unit production manager.</p>

<p>Love story: The Crown star displayed his youthful physique in a navy vest and khaki shorts as he held hands with his leading lady, before shopping for an al fresco drink</p>

<p>She has also been hired to work on his next film, The Inn At The Edge of the World, an adaptation of the Alice Thomas Ellis book about an unrelated group who answer an advert and go to a remote Scottish island to escape Christmas.</p>

<p>Charles will direct as well as star in that film, alongside Joanna Lumley and Freddie Fox.</p>

<p>Alessandra, who comes from Bologna, has a degree in film from Bologna University and has been working in the movie industry for nearly three decades. </p>

<p>The actor's marriage to sculptor Joanna Haythorn ended in 2004 after 34 years. The couple have two adult children, Oliver, 46, and Rebecca, 40.</p>

<p>In an interview last year, the star – who plays Lord Mountbatten in The Crown – said the end of his marriage had been a matter of great sadness. </p>

<p>He explained: 'I regret that the marriage ended; it was largely my fault. But sensibly, we’re now the best of friends.'</p>

<p>Charles told another interviewer that he had not been ‘the greatest husband in the world’ to Jo, whom he met when he was 19.  </p>

<p>Before their split was announced, he was linked to actress Emilia Fox. Then came a relationship with actress Sophia Myles, 33 years his junior; they dated from 2003 to 2005.</p>

<p>Next he dated model Shambhala Marthe, 26 years his junior, whom he met in a fruit and veg market. </p>

<p>She was succeeded in his affections by painter Eleanor Boorman, by whom he had a daughter, Rose, when he was 65. </p>

<p>Boorman is 25 years his junior and they split in 2012 soon after the baby arrived.</p>

<p>He told an interviewer in 2019 he likes 'beautiful women' and added: ‘I like independence, I like strong women, women who survive and thrive in what is still a male-dominated world in most professions. </p>

<p>'I think that description fits my ex-wife and my former fiancee, Eleanor.'</p>
