<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Zac Efron has been staying in the Australian coastal town of Byron Bay for the last few months.</p>

<p>And rumours that the Hollywood star could move there permanently have upset a few local residents, who fear that the town is now losing its 'community atmosphere'.</p>

<p>In a post shared to a Byron Bay Facebook group, one local wrote: 'Byron Bay used to be inclusive. If you don't have a tonne of money forget it.</p>

<p>'Byron Bay used to be inclusive!' Some Byron Bay locals have expressed concerns about Zac Efron potentially moving to the coastal town </p>

<p>'And by the way, I've lived in Byron Bay for nearly forty years, so it's got nothing to do with tall poppy [syndrome]. It's to do with losing the community atmosphere.</p>

<p>'Now it's all AirBnBs, this is what I don't like,' they finished.</p>

<p>Responding to the post, another resident wrote: 'Byron Bay has been destroyed for decades now, long before Efron ever went there. Hasn't been the hippie utopia it used to be.'</p>

<p>Another person wrote: 'They will inflate the prices, next thing the average Aussie can't afford to live there.'</p>

<p>Comedian Ed Kavalee, 41, said on Monday that Zac's presence in Byron Bay potentially spells disaster for locals. </p>

<p>'No, no, just even hearing the words... I mean Byron was already teetering and now it's gone... that's terrible news!' he said on the Hughesy &amp; Ed drive show.</p>

<p>Ed warned that an influx of American celebrities could soon follow if word spreads that Byron Bay is a haven for young Hollywood stars.</p>

<p>'Because where one goes, they all follow,' he said.</p>

<p>Speaking out: Comedian Ed Kavalee (pictured with his wife, Tiffiny Hall) said on Monday that Zac's presence in Byron Bay potentially spells disaster for locals</p>

<p>Ed's radio co-host Dave 'Hughesy' Hughes supported Zac and said that he would like to see more celebrities in Byron Bay. </p>

<p>But Ed strongly disagreed, saying that a wave of famous actors would result in house prices going through the roof.</p>

<p>Having so many celebrities in town could also make it difficult for locals to gain entry to venues, he argued.</p>

<p>Locals: Zac isn't the only famous face in the area. Chris Hemsworth (right) and his wife, Elsa Pataky (left), live in a $20million mega-mansion in Broken Head, near Byron Bay</p>

<p>Ed explained: 'It's already expensive. Prices will go through the roof. You'll try and go to a café and they'll be like "Sorry, not today" and there's four people in there and it'll be Efron and his buddies and someone else!'</p>

<p>Dave said this was unfair, and pointed out that Zac 'blends in' with the locals and 'wants to hang out in Australia and live a real life'.</p>

<p>He also noted that famous Byron Bay locals, like Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, don't get special treatment and are considered part of the community.</p>

<p>Zac, who has been living in Byron Bay for several months, is said to be dating a local woman named Vanessa Valladares.</p>

<p>They reportedly met in July when Vanessa, who is also a model, was working as a waitress at the Byron Bay General Store café.</p>
