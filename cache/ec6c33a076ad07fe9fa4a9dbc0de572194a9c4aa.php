<p>An ex-Army sergeant who battered a father-of-two to death with 'ferocious' blows and stole from his home to pay off a drugs debt has today been jailed for life.</p>

<p>Daniel Shovelton, 40, was found guilty of killing Mark Bradbury, 58, in his own home in Warrington, Cheshire in an attempt to solve £53,000 of debt he had accumulated due to his £1,000-a-month drug habit.</p>

<p>He initially lied to police about sleeping in his parents' car at the time of the murder, but was caught on CCTV buying whisky with Mr Bradbury's cash just hours later.</p>

<p>Shovelton was today handed a life sentence with a minimum of 24 years in prison after being convicted of the murder at Liverpool Crown Court.</p>

<p>During a two-week trial, jurors heard how 'doting' dad Mr Bradbury was 'battered to death' in the harrowing ordeal in August last year.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said Shovelton saw 'small time' cocaine dealer Mr Bradbury, who sold drugs in order to fund his own habit, as the 'answer to his problems'.</p>

<p>Shovelton, who served in Afghanistan and Ireland, made three trips to his victim's street on the day of Mr Bradbury's death, and was captured a fourth time on CCTV in the area at 7.10pm.</p>

<p>He remained there for three hours before leaving shortly before 10pm. </p>

<p>Victim Mark Bradbury's daughter Hannah (pictured together), 19, read out a 'powerful and poignant' statement in court as Shovelton was sentenced today</p>

<p>The body of Mr Bradbury was discovered three days later, with a post-mortem investigation concluding that he had died of head and neck injuries. </p>

<p>Shovelton, who had recently lost his job as a delivery driver, had known Mr Bradbury for 20 years before the attack and regularly bought cocaine from him. </p>

<p>The court heard how he was living with his parents after his home was repossessed and had resorted to asking his daughter to lend him money.</p>

<p>Shovelton was found guilty of murder on Friday, after police found traces of blood on a key ring.  </p>

<p>Officers also recovered Mr Bradbury's gold ring inside his pocket and an empty packet of cigarettes which police believed were purchased on the evening of his death. </p>

<p>The victim's daughter Hannah, 19, read out a 'powerful and poignant' statement in court as Shovelton was sentenced today.  </p>

<p>She said: 'It is extremely difficult to put into words the experience over the last year.</p>

<p>'It is a pain only imaginable and a living nightmare. The things I used to enjoy I do not anymore, and it does not get easier. On August 4, my life fell apart and nothing will ever fix that.</p>

<p>'People say I am brave, but I am not. I'm frightened and scared that I will never stop grieving.</p>

<p>'You cannot say everything happens for a reason as this shouldn't happen to anyone.</p>

<p>'My dad made memorable impressions on people and was someone who would give anyone the coat from his back.</p>

<p>'He will be greatly missed.'</p>

<p>Sentencing, Judge David Aubrey told Shovelton: 'In August last year, you battered and strangled to death Mark Bradbury in his own home. </p>

<p>'I am satisfied that you killed him and intended to do so as you were desperate and he was an easy target.</p>

<p>'The killer, you, had been rumaging around and was looking for anything worth stealing.</p>

<p>'You went on a magical mystery tour to discard discriminating items, including your blood-stained clothing.</p>

<p>'A powerful and poignant statement from the victim's daughter describes him as someone who would give anyone the coat from his back.'</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Sarah Oliver, from Cheshire Police, added: 'I hope the conviction of Shovelton helps Hannah and all those who knew Mark to continue to come to terms with what happened.</p>

<p>'Shovelton has never shown any remorse for his actions and continues to avoid responsibility for the hurt he has caused.</p>

<p>'He has shown himself to be an utterly selfish man who put his own need for cash and cocaine above all else.</p>

<p>'He saw Mark as someone who he could take both - with devastating consequences.</p>

<p>'This case demonstrates the impact drug and gambling addiction can have and I would urge anybody with an addiction to seek help.'</p>
