<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp insists there is no 'secret recipe' to their incredible unbeaten home form and it is purely down to hard work.</p>

<p>The Reds are closing in on the club record of 63 home league wins, set between 1978-81 and the last time they were beaten at Anfield was when they lost 2-1 to Crystal Palace in April 2017.</p>

<p>They have dropped only six points out of the last 120 at home (winning 37 and drawing three of 40 matches).</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp insists that there is 'no secret recipe' to Liverpool's formidable Anfield record</p>

<p>The Premier League champions have dropped just six of their last 120 points available at home</p>

<p>However, Liverpool's formidable statistics mean little to Klopp.</p>

<p>'The only time I think about that number is when someone asks me about it and once I've answered the question I forget it immediately because I am absolutely not interested,' he added.</p>

<p>'We did what we did. We try to win football games and we've done that at home in different circumstances, at nighttime, lunchtime, with supporters, without supporters.</p>

<p>'It is our home and we feel really well there but it is no secret recipe what we have - we never expect to lose but we don't expect to win.</p>

<p>'It is just we know we have to work and we want to deserve three points, that's what we want. That is it, pretty much.'</p>

<p>Klopp says there is no expectation to win at home and said he does not think about the record</p>

<p>Liverpool's 60-match unbeaten home run will be put to the test by a resurgent Arsenal on Monday in what promises to be an enthralling encounter.</p>

<p>Klopp believes it is far too premature to talk about title contenders but he promised the defending champions will be among them come the end of the season.</p>

<p>Their last two encounters have seen the Gunners prevail, albeit once on penalties in last month's Community Shield, but having beaten big-spending Chelsea last weekend Klopp refused to view this as a showdown between two title rivals.</p>

<p>'I don't know why we speak about winning the league after two matchdays,' he said.</p>

<p>'A lot of times it is an open race. Chelsea will be there 100 per cent, (Manchester) United, Arsenal, Tottenham - these teams will always be there.</p>

<p>'Then there are tough moments for us and others in a season and it is about how you react.</p>

<p>'The season is not a sprint it is a marathon and you have to go through a lot of different moments.</p>

<p>'I don't know who will win the league at the end of the season but I know a few teams will try and we will be one of them.'</p>
