<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Aston Villa chief Christian Purslow has blasted the government’s decision to cap crowds at 1,000 for potential test events in September.</p>

<p>In July the government indicated fans may be able to return to stadiums from October but that is now under review after a rise in infections. </p>

<p>That has left England’s major sports contemplating a £1billion black hole if crowds cannot come back.</p>

<p>Christian Purslow has blasted decision to cap crowds at 1,000 for test events in September</p>

<p>Purslow has warned the Premier League faces losing £100m a month while fans are shut out</p>

<p>Villa chief executive Purslow said: ‘We feel rather disappointed. The only thing you will learn from having 1,000 fans at a test event is that football clubs lose huge amounts of money when their stadiums are empty and that has a profound impact on the economy of football.’</p>

<p>Purslow, who has warned the Premier League faces losing £100m a month while fans are shut out, pointed to a successful test event at Brighton in which 2,500 fans were allowed in to watch a pre-season friendly against Chelsea. Arsenal's Premier League home match against Sheffield United had been earmarked as potential reduced-capacity test event.</p>

<p>Purslow also revealed Villa Park’s 42,000 capacity would be reduced to just 4,000 under the current rules. </p>

<p>A test event at Brighton allowed 2,500 fans to watch a pre-season friendly against Chelsea</p>

<p>He told the BBC: ‘The government have been in possession for over two months of a wide-ranging proposal for a set of test events that should have taken place in September, including what we thought of as a pioneering event in central London to try and move away from this social distancing limitation as the basis of which to determine how many fans can come in.</p>

<p>‘In our stadium if we applied the one metre plus metric only about 4,000 fans could come in to 42,000-seater Villa Park and anyone can see that's not viable.</p>

<p>‘We are advocating a testing largely in line with rugby where a huge amount of accurate pre-testing is done of a known audience of fans before and after matches.</p>

<p>‘That not only provides a safe environment but helps the government with a very large sample size. We were proposing 50 per cent in a large London stadium which would have been the biggest sample ever taken.’ </p>
