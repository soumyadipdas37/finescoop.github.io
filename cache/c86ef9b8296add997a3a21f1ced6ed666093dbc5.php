<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea winger Kenedy has joined Spanish side Granada in yet another loan move for the young Brazilian. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old winger spent the 2019-20 campaign at his new club's LaLiga rivals Getafe who finished just two points behind Granada in eighth-place. </p>

<p>It is the fifth loan move of Kenedy's career and he will bring European experience to a Granada side who are set to play in the first Europa League campaign in their history. </p>

<p>Chelsea winger Kenedy has joined Granada in his fifth loan move since joining the Blues</p>

<p>The winger will get the chance to play Europa League football with Granada this term</p>

<p>The winger joined Chelsea five years ago from Brazilian side Fluminense and made 20 appearances in his first season at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>But the sacking of Jose Mourinho in the winter of 2015 saw Kenedy fall out of favour at the Blues, with the 24-year-old playing just one Premier League game since the summer 2016. </p>

<p>The Brazilian has had loan spells at Watford and Newcastle United since joining Chelsea but has never scored more than two goals a season for an English club. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old spent the 2019-20 season on loan at LaLiga side Getafe, who finished eighth</p>

<p>Kenedy has played one game for Chelsea since being kicked off the club's tour of China in 2017</p>

<p>2016-17 season: Watford</p>

<p>2017-18 season: Newcastle United</p>

<p>2018-19 season: Newcastle United</p>

<p>2019-20 season: Getafe </p>

<p>Kenedy was the subject of controversy after he was kicked off Chelsea's tour of China in 2017 for posting videos on social media that were deemed 'offensive' among the west London club's Asian fanbase.</p>

<p>He has played just one competitive game for Chelsea since he was thrown off the pre-season campaign - a 5-1 League Cup victory over Nottingham Forest in September of the same year. </p>

<p>Last season, Kenedy played his first season in Spanish football for Getafe, scoring three times in 27 appearances in all competitions as the LaLiga club reached the Europa League last-16 stage.</p>

<p>The Brazilian's chances of game time at Stamford Bridge were reduced by the attacking acquisitions of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz as Frank Lampard plans a £200million overhaul of his first-team squad.   </p>
