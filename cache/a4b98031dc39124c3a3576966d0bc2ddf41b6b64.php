<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Novak Djokovic's former manager believes that Roger Federer would not have been disqualified for hitting a line-judge in the same manner that the Serb did at the US Open on Sunday. </p>

<p>The world number one and favourite for the men's singles title was kicked out of the tournament after accidentally hitting line-judge Laura Clark with a ball in a moment of anger. </p>

<p>Yet Niki Pilic, who used to manage the 33-year-old, believes there is no chance that 20-time Grand Slam champion would have been similarly defaulted and accused Clark of 'acting a little.' </p>

<p>World No 1 Novak Djokovic was disqualified after hitting the line judge at the US Open </p>

<p>Djokovic inadvertently struck Kentucky-based official Laura Clark in the throat at US Open</p>

<p>Yet Djokovic's ex-manager believes Roger Federer would have got away with a similar incident </p>

<p>'In my opinion, Novak Djokovic accidentally hit the line-judge with the ball,' Pilic told Serbian press. </p>

<p>'I think he should have been punished with a confiscated game. It is not right to disqualify the first in the world because of this.</p>

<p>'I believe that the judge also acted a little, I don't think she was so hurt.</p>

<p>'Do you think Roger Federer would be kicked out for something like this? No chance. This decision is tendentious.' </p>

<p>Pilic's comments comes days after some fans said Federer was not penalised at all for a similar incident at the 2006 Australian Open.  </p>

<p>Djokovic is currently three short of Federer's record-haul of 20 Grand Slam men's singles titles</p>

<p>After his first serve was called out, Federer swung his racket behind his back and inadvertently hit the ball boy at the side of the net.</p>

<p>The Swiss tennis star didn't receive a code violation and the situation was laughed off, by the ball boy also, at the time.</p>

<p>However, fans have since brought that incident back up as they have been comparing it to the Djokovic saga. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, another tennis fan simply said: 'If Federer did what Djokovic did he wouldn't be disqualified. The ATP hates to see Djokovic win.'</p>

<p>Swiss tennis star Federer struck a ball boy accidentally at the Australian Open 14 years ago</p>

<p>Federer swung his racket from behind before hitting the ball boy (circled in yellow) </p>

<p>The incident involving Federer back in 2006 was laughed off by everyone court-side</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'I'm not the biggest Djokovic fan but I would 100% agree that there was no anger or malice in that incident. </p>

<p>'I can't believe the extent of his punishment. I also agree that had that been Federer it would have been a totally different outcome.' </p>

<p>Yet with Djokovic's disqualification, the US Open men's draw is wide open as we reach the semi-finals stage. </p>

<p>Pablo Carreno Busta, who was the beneficiary of Djokovic's default, plays Alexander Zverev on Friday, while third seed Daniil Medvedev takes on second seed Dominic Thiem in the second semi-final. </p>
