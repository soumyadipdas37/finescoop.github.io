<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has revealed plans to for an MMA tournament in his late father's honour. </p>

<p>Abdulmanap died in July at the age of 57 following complications after he contracted coronavirus in Russia. </p>

<p>After his death, tributes poured in for a man many consider to be one of the great pioneers of the sport and a legendary coach, not least to his lightweight champion son. </p>

<p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has set up a tournament in honour of his late father Abdulmanap (top)</p>

<p>And now Khabib is planning his own dedication to Abdulmanap in the form of an MMA tournament to take place before the end of this year. </p>

<p>He told Match TV: 'This tournament will be annual, we have already planned it.  </p>

<p>'Only the date will change. So every year at the end of summer or at the beginning of fall we will have this event every year. Other than that, there were no problems with the organization. </p>

<p>'The fighters wanted to fight, and promoters also were also interested in making the event. Most likely due to the fact that many events have been canceled because of coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Abdulmanap died in July after suffering with complications following coronavirus </p>

<p>The fight against Justin Gaethje in October will be Khabib's first since his father's death </p>

<p>'So everything came about very well. I hope the tournament will be held at a high level.'</p>

<p>The first tournament will be promoted by Fight Nights Global and headlined by Vladimir Mineev and Dauren Ermekov. Usman Nurmagomedov, Khabib's cousin will also feature. </p>

<p>It will take place in Irina Viner-Usmanova Gymnastics Palace in Moscow. </p>

<p>Khabib has a fight to prepare for himself. The undefeated 155-pound champion will take centre stage at UFC 254 on October 24. </p>

<p>He is taking on Justin Gaethje, who dismantled Tony Ferguson to earn his title shot and will provide arguably the sternest test of the wrestling supremo to date. </p>

<p>Gaethje should provide the most serious test of Khabib's undefeated record so far </p>
