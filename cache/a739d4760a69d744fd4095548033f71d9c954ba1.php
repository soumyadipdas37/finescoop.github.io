<p>The college would not confirm which houses were involved but said parents had been informed of the outbreak.</p>

<p>In a statement, it said: 'Acting on the advice of senior health professionals, Eton took the decision to test all pupils and staff for Covid-19 on their return to school, having carefully assessed the risks of transmission within our specific boarding context.</p>

<p>'In deciding to test, Eton has been determined not to put additional pressure on the NHS. Therefore, a contract has been taken out with a private provider and the school is covering all costs.</p>

<p>'On their return to the school, a few asymptomatic pupils have tested positive and the school is following Health Protection Agency advice in relation to their isolation and the tracing of their contacts.</p>

<p>The last of the school's students returned to the prestigious college near Windsor in Berkshire on Thursday and pupils were tested privately to avoid the use of NHS services</p>

<p>'Other pupils continue in school in accordance with the appropriate social distancing and other mitigating measures we have put in place.' </p>

<p>The £42,000-a-year school was founded in 1441 and has many notable alumni including Prince William, Prince Harry and Prime Minister Boris Johnson.</p>

<p>It is also where former PM David Cameron was taught, alongside Bear Grylls and actors Tom Hiddleston and Hugh Laurie.  </p>
