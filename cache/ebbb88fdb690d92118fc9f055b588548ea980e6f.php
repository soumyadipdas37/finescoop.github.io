<p>September 1st at 9:41pm, Jovie Noelle made her entrance into this world. We are so incredibly in love and grateful for the support we had in labor and delivery and this week following. Although she made her entrance into the world a week ago, she just made it home to us. I planned a lot for birth but I never planned on leaving my daughter in the hospital NICU. She is such a strong fighter and has wowed the doctors with her ability to overcome since day 1. We are still processing this last week and going to take some time together as a family to soak everything in since this is the first time we get to be all together as a family. We could not have done it without our incredible <?php echo e('@'); ?>omgmidwives family, our midwife <?php echo e('@'); ?>sarahstetina and our doula <?php echo e('@'); ?>karishmadarji We cannot wait to share Jovieâ€™s birth story with you next week on the podcast! ðŸ“¸ <?php echo e('@'); ?>karishmadarji (my amazing doula)</p>
