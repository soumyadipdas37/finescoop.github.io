<p>News outlet Stuff reports support for the Yes and No campaigns in the 'reeferendum' is split at 49.5 per cent each, with one per cent saying 'don't know'.</p>

<p>The No campaign, which aims to keep the status quo, has an edge when just registered voters are counted, leading 50.8 per cent to 48.4 per cent.</p>

<p>New Zealanders are within a percentage point of legalising and taxing cannabis, according to a new poll six weeks out from a referendum on the matter (file picture)</p>

<p>The vote is being held alongside a similar referendum on euthanasia at the national election on October 17.</p>

<p>Voting and being on the electoral roll is optional in New Zealand.</p>

<p>The new poll, of 1,300 voters, shows the closeness of the debate.</p>

<p>Each survey conducted by pollsters aligned with major TV network polling has put the prohibitionist campaign ahead, while most online polls show the opposite.</p>

<p>The vote is being held at the behest of the Greens, which made the referendum a condition of their support for Jacinda Ardern's Labour-led government back in 2017.</p>

<p>Ms Ardern is sitting on the fence on the issue, refusing to be drawn on which way she will vote, and with a surprisingly blank history on the topic.</p>

<p>That's drawn the ire of campaigners, hoping the country's most popular politician might intervene to tip the ballot their way.</p>

<p>Labour has offered its MPs a conscience vote while opposition National MPs are all voting against it.</p>
