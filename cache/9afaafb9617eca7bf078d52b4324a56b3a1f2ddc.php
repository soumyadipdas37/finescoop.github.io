<p>Dog owner Hayley-Jay Hounslow and her partner Jaime Proietti fronted Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday following the incident in April 2019</p>

<p>Hounslow's American Staffy, named Hudson, had escaped the couple's Mount Gravatt East home before setting upon a little girl</p>

<p>Hounslow and Proietti were both away from home but returned following the attack and were questioned by council investigators.</p>

<p>The court heard in an interview Hounslow claimed her dog did not jump over or dig under the 120cm wire mesh enclosure that housed the American Staffy.</p>

<p>She claimed her partner found the mesh cut and scratches around the window as well as a smudge on the glass pane.   </p>

<p>Council's Zoe Sinclair said in the interview there was a lack of witnesses to back up claims of a break-in.</p>

<p>'Nobody heard anything, saw anything suspicious … can you see how this looks?' she said.</p>

<p>Prosecutor Mark Thomas said the outcome of the case hinged on whether or not the pair had taken adequate steps to keep the dog on the property. </p>

<p>Hounslow has pleaded guilty to failing to register the dog with Brisbane City Council.</p>

<p>She has pleaded not guilty to failing to take reasonable steps to ensure the dog did not attack a person and failing to ensure it did not wander.</p>

<p>Proietti has pleaded not guilty to all three charges. </p>

<p>She was left with injuries that required surgery and a partial amputation of her ear while the dog was later euthanised</p>
