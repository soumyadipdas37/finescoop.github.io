<p>Guests at Sunday's preview all wore monogrammed face masks that were provided at the entrance of the gallery and social distancing was enforced. </p>

<p>Changes: Victoria, like most designers, opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week </p>

<p>Speaking to Grazia Victoria explained that she spent a lot of time over lockdown wondering how she was going to present the collection. </p>

<p>She at first thought she would show the collection with a small presentation to just editors, before making a last minute decision to go digital and open up the LFW event to everyone. </p>

<p>'There is obviously more pressure on digital content — the video that we're going to be shooting today, the pictures that we take...</p>

<p>'I think that the challenge this season has been less about the clothes and more about everything else. I always welcome change and challenge,' Victoria said. </p>

<p>Sweet: She shared an Instagram photo of her daughter Harper, nine, dressed in a mini version of one of her dresses with a matching face mask</p>

<p>'When I look at the business and how Covid-19 has affected business —people are buying clothes online. My online business is doing very well. Again it reiterates the importance of digital and making sure the customers get that content. It's a different kind of pressure this season.'</p>

<p>She added that she enjoyed the designing process immensely, explaining: 'It's a smaller collection and I can honestly say working on this collection has reminded me why I fell in love with fashion in the first place. I've enjoyed the limitations, I really have.'</p>

<p>'We created the pre-collection in the back garden. We all had to work remotely and there was an element of that which was nice, being home with David and children and having quality time.</p>

<p>'But for me I like to be with my team I like to be with the fabrics. I've really become really close to my team through this whole process.'</p>

<p>Family love: Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons</p>

<p>Love:  She also receoved a bouquet of roses from eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz alongside a sweet note</p>
