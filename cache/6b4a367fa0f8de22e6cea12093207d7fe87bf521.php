<p>On Monday, Kendall showed how politically engaged she was by making her debut Instagram Live video.</p>

<p>She had a conversation with Jon Favreau, former speech writer for President Barack Obama and current host of the popular politics podcast Pod Save America.</p>

<p>The reality star had some initial technical difficulties since she wasn't used to the format, but once things got underway the two discussed the perils of voter suppression across the country and the importance of increasing youth voting turnout.</p>

<p>'If you don't like what's happening in America right now, I honestly think this election is your last chance to change it,' Favreau warned.</p>

<p>'Voting won't elect a savior, it won't solve all our problems, but voting will give us a chance to do something about climate change, systemic racism, healthcare, and education. Voting will give us a chance to make sure that our politics isn't as f**ked up as it is right now, and that we're not all at each other's throats like we are right now.'</p>

<p>Kendall's turn toward social engagement comes as her long-running series Keeping Up With The Kardashians is set to end.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Kardashian–Jenner family announced that the show would finish with its 20th season in 2021.</p>

<p>That still leaves fans with time to watch the current 19th season, and Kendall and her family are currently at work filming the final season.</p>

<p>The move to end the series came from Kris Jenner and was sparked by Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's desire to end their participation, according to Page Six. </p>

<p>Saying goodbye: Her outing came after the Kardashian–Jenner clan decided to end Keeping Up With The Kardashians, reportedly because Kim and Kylie wanted out</p>
