<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It says everything about the enduring ability of Sir Alastair Cook that he made a masterful 172 for Essex on Friday against a Somerset attack that had not conceded more than 200 in any previous Bob Willis Trophy innings this season.</p>

<p>What a performance this was from England's record run-scorer and what a batsman Cook remains, at 35, as he devotes what is left of his extraordinary career to churning out yet more runs and winning trophies with his beloved Essex.</p>

<p>But whether his seventh hundred at Lord's but his first for his county will win Essex this new competition remains to be seen as his late dismissal on the third day left this inaugural final tantalisingly poised.</p>

<p>Sir Alastair Cook made a masterful 172 for Essex in the Bob Willis Trophy final at Lord's</p>

<p>Cook appeared to be leading Essex comfortably to the first innings lead that will prove decisive should this final be drawn until he became the fifth wicket to fall after tea, well caught low by Craig Overton at second slip off Lewis Gregory.</p>

<p>And that left Essex on 271 for six at the close, needing another 31 off the 22 overs left for that all-important lead before they reach 120 overs and the compulsory end of their first innings in rules brought in to protect bowlers in this blighted season.</p>

<p>Game very much on, with the side who concedes that lead this morning then having to make all the running over the last two days to try to conjure up a victory that would give Somerset their maiden first-class title or Essex their third in four years.</p>

<p>Whatever happens this was vintage Cook, seemingly still as good as ever and demonstrating that his desire, hunger, devotion to his county and sheer quality remain as strong as ever two years after his Test retirement.</p>

<p>Cook's 67th first-class century was the mainstay of Essex's 271-6 in reply to Somerset's 301</p>

<p>This was like a Test, too, during a hostile opening burst from Overton, who used the extra pace he has added to his game to elicit the only shaky moments Cook really had, edging the Somerset spearhead over the slips on 10 and just short of them on 18.</p>

<p>That was as close as Somerset got to getting out the man who denied them their first Championship title with his resistance at Taunton in the decider last year and is making it so much harder for them for finally clinch a first-class honour this time.</p>

<p>At least until, with the late season sun shining low in the batsmen's eyes and leading the umpires to consider taking the players off, Cook made his first real mistake and walked off to the rich applause of his team-mates after more than six hours of pure class.</p>

<p>'I'm not making excuses but the light was actually tricky,' said Cook. 'The ball came out of the dark of the pavilion into the light of the sun but it was a good ball and if I'd left it everything would have been alright. To be fair Jamie Porter made it look easy!' </p>

<p>Lewis Gregory inspired Somerset's revival in the evening session with the second new ball</p>

<p>Such was Cook's off-side fluency that he brought up his 50 with a cover driven four off Gregory and then reached his 67th first-class hundred with a square driven boundary off the unfortunate Jack Leach, without a wicket and barely any cricket in this calendar year.</p>

<p>Cook, who completely dominated a stand of 170 for the second wicket with his captain Tom Westley, then steadied the Essex ship with Ryan ten Doeschate after Somerset had given themselves hope with a three-wicket burst after tea.</p>

<p>Essex's England's past in Westley and their England future in Dan Lawrence both fell to rash shots and when Paul Walter was trapped first ball by Gregory Essex had slipped to 208 for four and their nerves started to jangle. The departures of ten Doeschate and Cook to the second new ball will have only increased that sense of unease in Chelmsford.</p>

<p>Essex will resume on the fourth morning with nightwatchman Jamie Porter and Adam Wheater </p>

<p>But there is no unease about the motivation of a legend of the game who has averaged more than 50 for Essex since that glorious farewell to England at the Oval in 2018. </p>

<p>'I enjoy playing with this bunch of lads,' said Cook, who has one more year on his Essex contract. </p>

<p>'It's just good fun. I was scared of walking totally away from the game when I retired from Test cricket because it's a big hole to fill but I have loved hanging out in this changing room and it's all the better when you win.' </p>

<p>Thanks to Cook's single-handed dominance of Somerset yesterday Essex remain very much in the hunt to win this one.</p>
