<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian supermarket 'Karen' has tried to steal a grandfather's Disney+ Ooshies he was collecting for his grandchildren.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old male witness shared the 'disgusting' story on Reddit, saying that he felt the woman wanted to 'sell' the plastic figurines online for a profit.</p>

<p>The male student had been harmlessly shopping at Woolworths, spending a total of $60 and earning three Ooshies in the process. </p>

<p>Not wanting to keep the toys for himself, the student decided to give them to someone who might appreciate them more. </p>

<p>'I see an older gentleman and ask if he would like the Ooshies. He said yes and that his grandchildren would love them as the oldest one is only seven,' the man recalled.</p>

<p>A 20-year-old man shared the heartbreaking story on Reddit , saying that he felt the woman wanted to 'sell' the plastic figurines online for a profit</p>

<p>'Perfect, so I hand them over and that's when I hear a troll clearing her throat. I turn around to see a Karen staring at me while standing next to her son, as he just looked at his phone. I wasn't in the way or anything so I just gave her a confused look.'</p>

<p>The woman proceeded to ask him why her son, who was 14, couldn't get a share of the Ooshies.  </p>

<p>'He's a little old. I wanted to give them to someone with young ones as kids love Disney,' the young shopper responded.</p>

<p>She asked if instead the man would be open to 'trading' with her, but the grandfather wanted his grandchildren to be the ones to open the packet because 'that was half the fun'.</p>

<p>This reportedly angered the 'Karen', who told the older gentleman to 'just give me the damn things' before she lunged forward to snatch them out of his cart. </p>

<p>The collection includes silver, gold, colour changing, glow in the dark, and additional glitter editions, which can all be kept in a special limited-edition Ooshies box</p>

<p>'I see this coming so I grab her around the wrist stopping her from taking them. People started watching the incident,' the Reddit thread continued. </p>

<p>'A manager from the store came running over and the old man started talking. I think that startled Karen because she then let go and walked off. </p>

<p>'I'm still p<strong>sed with how it panned out because Karen was only trying to get them in pursuit of the rare ones, most likely to sell. I seriously f</strong>king hate Ooshies if you couldn't already tell.'</p>

<p>Plenty of commenters said the woman 'had some nerve' for harassing an elderly man in that way and that the country's love for Ooshies was 'getting out of control'.  </p>

<p>Woolworths announced the full list of Disney Plus Ooshies collectables featuring iconic characters like Elsa and Anna from Frozen, Elastigirl from The Incredibles and Darth Vader from Star Wars</p>

<p>Australian shoppers started collecting the themed figurines from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars movies with every $30 spent in store or online from Wednesday, August 26</p>
