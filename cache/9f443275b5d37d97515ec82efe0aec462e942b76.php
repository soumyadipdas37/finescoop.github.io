<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two people are dead and at least 50 Floridians are infected with COVID-19 after a social club hosted a series of 'superspreader' events in August. </p>

<p>The Social Club of Palm Coast on September 12 revealed that staff had contacted dozens of people affected by the COVID-19 outbreak linked to their establishment.  </p>

<p>The outbreak killed a 69-year-old woman on August 31 and a 74-year-old man on September 13, both of whom died of COVID-19-related infections linked to events.   </p>

<p>Flagler County health department chief Bob Snyder told FlagerLive that a few people were also hospitalized and at lease one person was in hospice. </p>

<p>FlaglerLive reports that one of the events took place at The Social Club of Palm Coast on August 28 and included a performance by a local entertainer. </p>

<p>The Social Club of Palm Coast (pictured) hosted a series of events in August that resulted in a number of infections and two deaths </p>

<p>Although FlagerLive initially linked all the infections and deaths solely to the August 28 event, health officials have since said that it spanned several functions.</p>

<p>During that week, the club hosted line dancing on Monday, a performance with Mike Kohn on Tuesday, trivia on Wednesday and other similar events.</p>

<p>But at the event on August 28, members showed up watch and sing along with Mike Kohn, a popular local DJ and performer. </p>

<p>Attendees reportedly wore masks when the entered the venue, but some began to gradually remove the coverings as they socialized. </p>

<p>'Almost everybody that entered wore a mask,' Gloria April, the newly elected secretary of the social club, told FlagerLive.</p>

<p>She added that club staffers tried to create space between attendees, but they wouldn't budge.</p>

<p>'We opened up the big room and tried to have people go into the big room and they didn't want to go,' said April.</p>

<p>'One table had 12 people at it and [a club employee] tried to get the people to not sit, to disperse at that table, to bring it down to 6,' said April.</p>

<p>'I know the governor says 10, or CDC says 10, but people want to sit together. You know, you can’t shoot people.' </p>

<p>Florida has limited indoor gatherings to 50 people and recommended wearing face masks to curb the spread of COVID-19. The state experienced a skyrocket in cases during the summer, but has so far recorded 693,040 cases and 13,795 deaths.</p>

<p>'This is actually a pretty dramatic event, it’s almost publishable, it’s that dramatic–50 people from one event, including deaths. It’s really a tragedy,' Dr. Stephen Bickel told Flager Live.</p>

<p>'It’s certainly profound ignorance of the risk. The public may not be aware of what a risk this is. I thought they did, but maybe not. </p>

<p>'I know that churches are not having singing in their services because of this kind of stuff. I don’t know if people realize it, but karaoke is as bad or worse, because they do it for a long period of time, you’re in a closed space.'</p>

<p>The CDC noted in a September 2020 study shared to the Emerging Infectious Disease Journal that activities like karaoke easily spread the virus.</p>

<p>'We noted many COVID-19 clusters were associated with heavy breathing in close proximity, such as singing at karaoke parties, cheering at clubs, having conversations in bars, and exercising in gymnasiums,' the study said. </p>

<p>The Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that it noted 'noted many COVID-19 clusters were associated with heavy breathing in close proximity'</p>

<p>This latest outbreak to come out of Florida underscores the importance of following public health guidelines as national cases edge towards 7million cases and deaths are now at 201,000.</p>

<p>'This karaoke thing is a classic example, little old Flagler County has its own superspreading event,' Bickel told the publication. 'Most places will never have an event this dramatic.'</p>

<p>It's unclear how many of the club's 294 paying members were at the karaoke event.</p>

<p>FlaglerLive reports that the outbreak contributed to spike in Flagler County that came from social clubs, schools and nursing homes.</p>

<p>Both Grand Oaks Health and Rehabilitation Center and Tuscan Gardens assisted living reportedly saw large upticks in cases. The local school district reported 47 cases connected to teachers and students.</p>

<p>The spike has caused around 400 cases since September 1 and the positivity rate has reached 10 per cent. Last week saw Flagler County's infection rate place it at No.39 in the state.</p>

<p>In a Facebook post, The Social Club Palm Coast said that its facilities would undergo sanitizing weekly and after large events.</p>

<p>'Serve Pro has sanitized the building and will be sanitizing the building post all major events weekly. Serve Pro has been sanctioned by the CDC for covid-19 outbreaks and they have been fabulous to work with our club.</p>

<p>Gloria April: 'Our number 1 priority is making sure we’re safe for everybody and this outbreak has made us more aware and proactive in making sure it’s a safe environment'</p>

<p>'As we have found out temperature checks are not always a proven stop-gap for covid as no one who entered the club had a fever those 2 nights.'</p>

<p>The post reiterated CDC recommendations and asked members to follow the advice in the future.</p>

<p>'There will be some more changes when we reopen the week of 9/21/20. The tables will be reduced in the bar area and the 6 feet will be enforced.</p>

<p>'No gatherings at tables of more than 8 as recommended by CDC guidelines. Masks will be worn at all times except when eating or drinking.'</p>

<p>April told FlagerLive that after the event and subsequent sanitizing, the social club will be better than ever.</p>

<p>'Our number 1 priority is making sure we’re safe for everybody and this outbreak has made us more aware and proactive in making sure it’s a safe environment. I think we’re going to be a safer club than any other club,' she said.  </p>
