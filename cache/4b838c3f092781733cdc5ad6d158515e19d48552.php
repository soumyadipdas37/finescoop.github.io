<p>'But you've reinforced to us that we did make the right call by showing your zest for life and for your sport.' </p>

<p>Mr Hall added that it had been a 'privilege' to treat Jonnie. In response, Jonnie, clearly emotional, said: 'He's such a good guy. You forget that this guy has to make really tough calls. </p>
