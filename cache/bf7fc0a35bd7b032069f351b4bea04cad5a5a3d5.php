<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A grieving mum has slammed a court's decision to allow her son's accused killer to walk free on bail because he refused to sleep in a prison cell alone.  </p>

<p>Thomas Tran, 20, was allegedly stabbed in his heart by Lindim Aliti, 18, during a gang attack at a shopping strip in Oakleigh, in Melbourne's southeast in June.</p>

<p>Victoria's Supreme Court released Mr Aliti on $600,000 bail this week after lawyers argued he could die from his epilepsy if he were to stay alone in his cell. </p>

<p>The court heard he had always slept in the same room as his brother or grandfather, who could intervene if he had potentially-fatal seizure. </p>

<p>Thomas' mother Amie Tran said her heart was 'broken' after hearing her son's alleged murderer had been released</p>

<p>'It's not fair. I'm not happy at all,' Ms Tran told A Current Affair.</p>

<p>Mr Tran's girlfriend of two years Trisha Nguyen said the decision was unfair and insulting to his family.  </p>

<p>'How their side is saying that he could possibly die in custody is really insensitive to our situation,' Ms Nguyen said.</p>

<p>'We didn't want to lose Thomas in that way ever. His parents will never get a change to ever have grandkids.'</p>

<p>Ms Nguyen said her boyfriend had dreams of becoming a personal trainer, and was 'really a good person'.</p>

<p>'He was the biggest goofball,' she said.</p>

<p>Mr Aliti's defence barrister Robert Richter QC, who defended Cardinal George Pell, said Mr Aliti's age, good record and medical condition meant should be bailed.</p>

<p>'The prison conditions that don't allow him to see his family... his whole life has been in residence with his siblings, his parents and his grandparents,' he said.   </p>

<p>Ms Nguyen said her boyfriend had dreams of becoming a personal trainer, and was 'really a good person'</p>

<p>Former Chief Magistrate Nick Papas QC said Mr Aliti's while it is rare, those accused of murder can be released on bail.</p>

<p>'Exceptional circumstances need to be shown,' he said.</p>

<p>The judge ruled that was the case, imposing strict conditions to manage any risk.</p>

<p>Mr Aliti must work at a Dandenong South factory and he is banned from parts of Oakleigh where the incident occurred.</p>

<p>His grandfather has entered a surety of $600,000.</p>

<p>Hee will return to court in December.</p>
