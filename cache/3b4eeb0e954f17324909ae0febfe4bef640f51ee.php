<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Government is set to use a 'gargle-and-spit' test for Covid-19 as part of Matt Hancock's pledge to test 4.5 million people per day. </p>

<p>The Department of Health and Social Care last week allowed companies to put forward ideas to make 'circa 3.0 million saliva collection kits per day'.</p>

<p>The saliva kits will come on top of 'circa 1.5 million swab collection kits per day' and all tests need to be 'packaged in a way that can fit through a standard UK letterbox' so they can be done at home. </p>

<p>The simple saliva test - involving spitting into a tube - would allow scores of nervous patients to avoid uncomfortable swabs currently being used to identify the virus.</p>

<p>The proposals would help accomplish the government's £100billion 'Operation Moon Shot' which pledges to increase daily tests by around twelve-fold by early next year to give the country back its 'freedom'. </p>

<p>Saliva testing could provide a cheap alternative to the current method being used across the world which involves a long cotton- bud-like stick, which is inserted high up into the nose or back of the throat, that then has to be sent to a laboratory for analysis. </p>

<p>Testing a patient's spit could also be a better method as saliva has higher quantities of the virus, The Times reports.</p>

<p>The throat and nose could also have lingering amounts of the RNA virus - which is less likely to be picked up in a saliva test. </p>

<p>Testing the saliva from a group of people - such as all children in one classroom - may also be an option, a method known as 'pooling'.</p>

<p>The group would all have to isolate if the collective sample came back positive.</p>

<p>Discussions between the Government and biotech company Halo are currently in place. The aim is to have the company able to do 500,000 tests a week.</p>

<p>Halo - whose factories have been hailed as more efficient than the swab laboratories currently in place - said the £50 tests are half the cost of those involving swabs and results can be returned five hours after the sample gets to the lab.</p>

<p>Current home testing kits can take three days.</p>

<p>Last month it was revealed that a 'gargle-and-spit' test has been developed by experts at Sheba Medical Centre, Israel's largest hospital.</p>

<p>Scientists there claimed their matchbox-size machine analyses samples in just one second. </p>

<p>Patients trialing the new test were asked to gargle a small amount of a special mouthwash, which they then spit into a tube. </p>

<p>The sample was placed inside the machine, called SpectraLIT, which analyses it to provide a diagnosis almost instantly.</p>

<p>Early results from a trial involving 400 people show it can distinguish between positive and negative Covid-19 samples with 95 per cent accuracy.</p>
