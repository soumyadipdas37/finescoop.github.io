<p>The EastEnders actor, 43, from Newham detailed the impact the legendary screenwriter had on his life and how he was something of a father figure for him, 12 years after his death.</p>

<p>In promotion of Sky Arts’ special documentary Danny Dyer on Harold Pinter, the soap star said in a press release: 'Harold never wanted me to change or hide my working-class roots, even though he did when he was younger.' </p>

<p>'He never wanted me to change': Danny Dyer has credited late playwright Harold Pinter for helping him stay proud of his 'working-class roots'</p>

<p>Sharing what he had instilled in him as a performer, the thespian added: 'It was the notion of not letting where you come from define where you're going... Harold had given me the confidence that a lot of people had knocked out of me.</p>

<p>'When I was in a room of middle-upper-class people, I felt that it was OK just to be me and Harold installed that in me.'</p>

<p>The Hackney-born director - who is widely recognised as one of the most influential British dramatists of all time - worked with Danny in stage performances such as Celebration (2000) and the revival of No Man's Land between 2001 and 2002. </p>

<p>The hardman also recalled when they met at an audition for their first collaboration 21 years ago.</p>

<p>He admitted: 'I walked in the audition room and, me being like I am and not really treating people any differently, I just walked in and went up to Harold and said, ''Hello son. How you doing?'' I felt the whole room just go, ''Ooh, oh dear.'''</p>

<p>However, Danny insisted his relaxed introduction endeared him to Harold, who cast him in the production.</p>

<p>The media personality explained: '[I don't think] anyone's approached him that way and I think he sort of respected that.' </p>
