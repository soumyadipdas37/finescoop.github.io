<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The new series of Great British Bake Off, set to air on Tuesday night, will be delayed.</p>

<p>The first episode of the 11th series of the Channel 4 show was scheduled to air at 8pm, but will now be delayed by several minutes to allow the channel to air Prime Minister Boris Johnson's address to the nation.</p>

<p>The delay has sparked fury among fans with one tweeting: 'If Boris's announcement forces #GBBO to be delayed it will be the end of him. He can U-turn as much as he likes but if he messes with our Bake Off people will be out for blood.'</p>

<p>Delayed! The new series of Great British Bake Off, set to air on Tuesday night, will be delayed. by several minutes  on Tuesday night to allow Channel 4 to air Prime Minister Boris Johnson's address to the nation at 8pm</p>

<p>TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan tweeted the news, telling fans on Tuesday afternoon that 'Bake Off will not clash with the PM’s statement. If it airs at 8pm when Bake Off starts, it will be delayed until Boris has finished his address.'</p>

<p>'Shouldn't it be the other way round?' quipped one fan in reply, while another noted that 'people complaining about Bake off clashing with Boris’ speech tonight is the most British thing I’ve ever heard.'</p>

<p>It's thought that while BBC and ITV have delayed their regular programming until 8:30pm to allow for analysis after the PM's address, Channel 4 will only delay until 8:05pm, allowing Bake Off to begin immediately afterwards. </p>

<p>Adding to the scheduling dilemma is Nicola Sturgeon's planned TV address to Scotland at 8:05pm.</p>

<p>Make way for Boris: TV critic and broadcaster Scott Bryan tweeted the news, telling fans on Tuesday afternoon that 'Bake Off will not clash with the PM’s statement'</p>

<p>Bake Off has already had its air date pushed back from the traditional late summer start date after filming was delayed by three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The production, which usually begins shooting in April, crammed its three month schedule into just six weeks after the 12 home-bakers, judges, presenters and crew lived in an isolation bubble on location.</p>

<p>The upcoming series was shot at Down Hall Hotel in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic. </p>

<p>How dare he! The delay has sparked fury among fans with one tweeting: 'If Boris's announcement forces #GBBO to be delayed it will be the end of him. He can U-turn as much as he likes but if he messes with our Bake Off people will be out for blood'</p>

<p>Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started for the new socially-distanced series with Paul Hollywood's signature handshake given the green light despite fears of spreading the virus and claims it could be replaced with an elbow bump.   </p>

<p>At the height of lockdown, the hit Channel 4 series signed an exclusive deal with luxury Down Hall Hotel and Spa in Essex, located on 110 acres of land, to hire it out in late July for the entire series. </p>

<p>The Observer reported that the country house and hotel allowed the show to book it out on a self-catering basis with 25 members of staff on hand to help out. </p>

<p>Man with a plan: Others joked that Boris scheduled the address before the fan favourite show to soften the blow</p>

<p>The publication claims that contestants were then allowed to move into the hotel with their partners, children or pet pooches - if they wished to do so - with measures put in place for child and dog care on set while filming for six weeks. The hit show is usually shot over a 12 week period with bakers travelling to and from their homes.    </p>

<p>Before entering the 'biosphere', the contestants had to quarantine for nine days with the 130 people involved with the show tested three times before filming.  </p>

<p>The publication claims that the luxury country house had different wings for cast and crew with new host Matt Lucas even hosting fun nights for show members. </p>

<p>Giggles: The Channel 4 baking contest, now in its 11th series, will welcome 12 home-bakers to the tent with the first show-stopping challenge to create their hero out of sponge (pictured presenter Matt Lucas with judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith) </p>

<p>Creative Director of Love Productions, Kieran Smith, told the Observer: 'The whole point of the bubble [was] being able to be close to each other or pat people on the back, or it wouldn't be Bake Off.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere, as well as the show's bubble, anything coming in and out of the Bake Off 'biosphere', including luggage and food deliveries, had to be deep-cleaned with packets of flour even cleaned several times.   </p>

<p>Despite being considered a high-risk candidate for coronavirus at 80, judge Prue decided to make a comeback to the much-loved series.  </p>

<p>I want to bake three.. cakes! The show's judges and presenters posed for a promotional snap in the theme of the iconic Queen II album cover on Tuesday</p>

<p>TV sources previously claimed producers banned older contestants who are considered vulnerable to the virus. </p>

<p>An insider told The Sun: 'There's a real sense of urgency to get the next series of Bake Off in the can, considering it's one of Channel 4's biggest draws.</p>

<p>'That means the nation's baking grans and grandads have been deemed too high risk. Bake Off's wizened contestants are often the heart of the show. Val, who would 'listen' to cakes to work out if they were done, and rapping septuagenarian Flo became favourites.'</p>

<p>Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, recently admitted it was an 'enormous' feat getting the show back on air. </p>

<p>One big bubble: The upcoming series took place at Down Hall Hotel in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire, with all cast and crew members undergoing regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic (the 2020 contestants pictured in the tent)  </p>

<p>The TV executive credited stringent health and safety measures, testing and quarantine regimes for the return of the baking hit. </p>

<p>While fellow judge, Paul, 54, was given the green light to give out his signature Hollywood handshakes due to the bubble despite fears of spreading the virus.  </p>

<p>The food expert's handshake is widely regarded as the golden ticket for bakers who aim to meet his high expectations or win Star Baker of the week.  </p>

<p>Kieran, of show maker Love Productions, confirmed recently that his iconic gesture will take place in the series despite fears it could be scrapped. </p>

<p>Hollywood handshake! Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started for the new socially-distanced series with Paul Hollywood's signature handshake given the green light despite fears of spreading the virus and claims it could be replaced with an elbow bump (pictured on the 2019 series) </p>

<p>The first time fans witnessed his congratulatory move was in series three of the former BBC show. The show was relaunched on Channel 4 in 2017 and saw him dish out another seven handshakes in just one run.   </p>

<p>Channel 4 clarified they followed strict safety protocol so that all parties were free to handshake to their heart's content.   </p>

<p>Fellow Bake Off presenter Sandi Toksvig revealed that she had left the show earlier this year and was replaced by Little Britain comedian Matt Lucas </p>

<p>Matt will partner up with fellow funnyman, Noel Fielding, 47, who originally joined the Great British Bake Off Cast in 2017.  </p>
