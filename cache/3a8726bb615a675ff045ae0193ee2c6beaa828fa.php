<p>In an interview with the Daily Telegraph last week, Casey revealed that she's been focusing on healthy eating and a calorie deficit to lose weight. </p>

<p>'My five a day would be broccolini, asparagus, sweet potato, onion (they’re a vegetable aren’t they?) and avocado,' she said.</p>

<p>'My body doesn’t work well on fruit in general because of my polycystic ovary syndrome.'</p>

<p>Flashback: Casey had a fuller figure in this selfie from November, 2019, taken a few months before she embarked on her fitness kick </p>

<p> The reality star has also started exercising, and also admitted that 'sex is great cardio'.</p>

<p>'I have tried shakes and I’ve tried keto but at the end of the day you have to find something that is sustainable for your body,' she explained.</p>

<p>'A calorie deficit is the best thing that has worked for my body, as well as upping my protein.'</p>
