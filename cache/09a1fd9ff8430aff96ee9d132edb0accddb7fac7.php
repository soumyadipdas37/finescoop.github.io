<p>'I'd sort of given up on dating. I dated so much and I was always sort of forcing myself into it.'  </p>

<p>They had their first date on Hampstead Heath and when asked what the couple's plan for the future was? Ed smiled and said: 'I think I'm sensing what kind of question you're asking. Things are going really well for me, I don't think anyone foresaw what was going to happen.'</p>
