<p>'In extreme cases, when I broke up with my ex, I took tablets to calm me down. Or if I'm travelling I take some stuff to calm me down. I'm a really bad traveller – planes, tubes, sometimes in taxis. I don't like being in any confined space.</p>

<p>'I go to events regularly and they can make me panicky because I'm surrounded by loads of people. So, it's weird the job I do because I do suffer from that really badly.' </p>

<p>My guy: She looked elated as they walked down the street</p>

<p>Drink O'Clock: The table was laden with booze </p>
