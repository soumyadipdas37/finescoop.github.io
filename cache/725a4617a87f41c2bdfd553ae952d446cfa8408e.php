<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sweden has beaten coronavirus by refusing to shut the country down and achieving herd immunity, according to an expert. </p>

<p>The Scandinavian nation was the only country in Europe not to introduce strict lockdown measures at the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>But scientists believe that this may have helped it avoid a second wave of Covid-19 as it continues to record its lowest number of cases since March - with just 28 infections per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>This figure is less than half of the UK's own infection rate of 69 per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>Sweden may have avoided second wave of coronavirus as it continues to record its lowest number of cases since March - with just 28 infections per 100,000 people</p>

<p>Professor Kim Sneppen, an expert in the spread of coronavirus at the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, said that Sweden might have beaten the pandemic.</p>

<p>He told Denmark's Politiken newspaper: 'There is some evidence that the Swedes have built up a degree of immunity to the virus which, along with what else they are doing to stop the spread, is enough to control the disease.</p>

<p>'Perhaps, the epidemic is over there.'</p>

<p>He said that the virus may now have run out of steam.</p>

<p>He added: 'That is what they have said. </p>

<p>'On the positive side, they may now be finished with the epidemic.' </p>

<p>Sweden was initially criticised at the start of the outbreak after recording a spike in its mortality rates which was five times that of Denmark and ten times that of Norway and Finland. </p>

<p>Number of deaths per 24 hours peaked in April at 115 with more than half in care homes.</p>

<p>But its seven-day average for coronavirus-related deaths is now zero.  </p>

<p>Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, who has become the face of the no-lockdown strategy, said in a recent interview that voluntary hygiene measures had been 'just as effective' as complete shutdowns. </p>

<p>Sweden kept open schools for children under 16, banned gatherings of more than 50 people and told over-70s and vulnerable groups to self-isolate.</p>

<p>Shops, bars and restaurants stayed open throughout the pandemic and the wearing of masks has not been advised by the government.  </p>

<p>'The rapidly declining cases we see in Sweden right now is another indication that you can get the number of cases down quite a lot in a country without having a complete lockdown,' he previously told Unherd. </p>

<p>Tegnell added that 'deaths are not so closely connected to the amount of cases you have in a country', saying the death rate was more closely linked to whether older people are being infected and how well the health system can cope. </p>

<p>'Those things will influence mortality a lot more, I think, than the actual spread of the disease,' he said. </p>

<p>Swedish economic activity has also started to pick up with the effects of the downturn looking less severe than previously feared.</p>

<p>The economy had shrunk by nine per cent but this too was less than the 20 per cent dip seen in the UK.</p>

<p>It is thought that because many younger people have already had coronavirus in Sweden it now has less chance to spread through the population. </p>

<p>Recent studies suggested that an infection rate of 43 per cent may be enough to achieve herd immunity - a figure much lower than the 60 per cent previously cited.   </p>

<p>Herd immunity is a situation in which a population of people is protected from a disease because so many of them are unaffected by it - because they've already had it or have been vaccinated - that it cannot spread. </p>

<p>To cause an outbreak a disease-causing bacteria or virus must have a continuous supply of potential victims who are not immune to it.</p>

<p>Immunity is when your body knows exactly how to fight off a certain type of infection because it has encountered it before, either by having the illness in the past or through a vaccine.</p>

<p>When a virus or bacteria enters the body the immune system creates substances called antibodies, which are designed to destroy one specific type of bug.</p>

<p>When these have been created once, some of them remain in the body and the body also remembers how to make them again. Antibodies - alongside T cells - provide long-term protection, or immunity, against an illness.</p>

<p>If nobody is immune to an illness – as was the case at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak – it can spread like wildfire.</p>

<p>However, if, for example, half of people have developed immunity – from a past infection or a vaccine – there are only half as many people the illness can spread to.</p>

<p>As more and more people become immune the bug finds it harder and harder to spread until its pool of victims becomes so small it can no longer spread at all.</p>

<p>The threshold for herd immunity is different for various illnesses, depending on how contagious they are – for measles, around 95 per cent of people must be vaccinated to it spreading.  </p>
