<p>The Government was already facing calls from opposition MPs to prevent the new owners of Arm, Britain's most valuable tech company, moving its headquarters abroad. </p>

<p>Now Tory figures are understood to be leaning on Business Secretary Alok Sharma to ensure Arm remains at its base in Cambridge, preserving thousands of British jobs. </p>

<p>Under pressure: Tory figures are understood to be leaning on Business Secretary Alok Sharma</p>

<p>Sources confirmed over the weekend that Arm is set to be snapped up by US rival Nvidia in a £30billion deal, just four years after it was bought by Japan's Softbank. The deal could be announced as soon as today. </p>

<p>When Softbank stumped up £24billion for Arm in 2016, Theresa May's government insisted on guarantees which would keep its HQ in Britain. </p>

<p>MPs are now urging Sharma to impose similar requirements on Nvidia, to prevent the UK losing its tech sector 'crown jewel'.</p>

<p>Labour MP Ed Miliband, shadow business secretary, said: 'The Government should show leadership and seek legally binding assurances from Nvidia, should it take over the company, to keep </p>

<p>Arm headquartered in the UK.' Arm, which makes vital chips used in smartphones, employs around 3,000 UK workers and has 6,500 staff globally. </p>

<p>When Softbank bought the business four years ago, ministers heralded the deal as a vote of confidence in post-Brexit Britain. </p>

<p>But critics said the UK was allowing foreign investors to snap up its most promising companies. Former City minister Lord Myners called the sale of Arm to Softbank a 'tragedy'. He said last month that the UK should 'introduce more legal and national protection around assets that we think are of significant importance'. </p>

<p>The Government can intervene in takeovers on national security grounds, and guidance cites examples of firms designing complex tech infrastructure, like Arm, among those that need protection. </p>

<p>Science and technology union Prospect also wrote to Sharma last week, urging him to stand up for Arm. </p>

<p>In a hint that ministers were considering restrictions, a Government spokesman said it was monitoring developments, adding: 'Where we feel a takeover may represent a threat to the UK, the Government will not hesitate to investigate, which could lead to conditions on the deal.' </p>
