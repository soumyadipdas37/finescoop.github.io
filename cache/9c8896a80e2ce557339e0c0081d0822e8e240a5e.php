<p>When New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been addressing anxious citizens about storm damage and safety issues, all eyes have been on his sign language interpreter Lydia Callis, 30.</p>

<p>Callis's larger-than-life facial expressions and dramatic gestures have provided a rare moment of pleasure during the unfolding natural disaster during which at least 55 people have lost their lives and millions are still without power.</p>

<p>Her performances have turned the petite, impeccably-dressed Callis into a viral web sensation and she has won a legion of fans on social media sites including Twitter and Tumblr.</p>

<p>Quietly brilliant: For many, interpreter Lydia Callis (left) has been the best thing about Mayor Michael Bloomberg's Hurricane Sandy briefings</p>

<p>Ms Callis in action: Viewers have praised her impressive range of facial expressions</p>

<p>New York Magazine wrote that Callis has given people 'a legitimate reason to smile' during these hard times.â€™</p>

<p>'Unlike Bloomberg's own stilted Spanish, another highlight of the updates, Callis's signing is both lightning-fast and emotive, her animated face lighting up and contorting happily as she goes, not unlike a guitarist during a blistering solo.'</p>

<p>'Lightning-fast and emotive': Ms Callis seems unwilling to embrace her newfound fame, and has declined requests for interviews, saying simply, 'I'm honoured that I was able to get the message out there'.</p>

<p>A few facts are known about Callis:</p>

<p>She graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology's National Technical Institute for the Deaf with an interpreting degree in 2010.</p>

<p>Her mom and three siblings are all deaf and so she has been interpreting for them since she was a child.</p>

<p>She also works as an American Sign Language interpreter for schools, hospitals, and businesses.</p>

<p>'I tell ya, the real star of Mayor Bloomberg's press conferences is that animated sign language translator he's got. Can't look away,' Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>JCamm_ wrote Oct. 29.</p>

<p>'I love that lady,' wrote a commenter on a YouTube video of her performance. 'Stupid news is blocking her on TV so they can show footage of something. But this lady is amazing.'</p>

<p>Callis has so far declined requests for interviews, although she recently told the New York Post: 'I'm here to serve the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. I'm just glad, and I'm honored, that I was able to get the message out there... that's what it's all about.'</p>

<p>There are at least seven schools for American Sign Language and the deaf in New York City and Long Island.</p>
