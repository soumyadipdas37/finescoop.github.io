<p>There's no denying that for the nation, this year hasn't gone quite as expected - with the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown resulting in many being separated from their nearest and dearest, experiencing unemployment, or the tragic loss of loved ones.</p>

<p>But while experts identified the warm and grounding neutral shade as the colour that will 'enable people to draw upon the strength of nature to help them find the courage to embrace the future,' others had a very different perspective.</p>

<p>'Dulux announces its "colour of the year" - isn't this what we once called 'gre-ige'? How very 2020,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'The marketing dept. at Dulux: 'People are having a c****y year - let's give them an uplifting colour for 2020!' ...Brown.'</p>

<p>Dulux has named 'Brave Ground' colour of the year for 2021  (pictured on the walls) - but social media users joked that it's better suited to 2020 instead</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, one person penned: 'People are having a c****y year - let's give them an uplifting colour for 2020!' ...Brown' (pictured)</p>

<p>Launched virtually for the very first time, this year’s colour and its palettes are said to represent the natural, earthy, elements found around us every day. </p>

<p>According to an expert, the neutral shade will 'create a nurturing space' that will 'encourage people to find the courage to express themselves, stand up for what they believe in and make new connections from the past to the future.'</p>

<p>Marianne Shillingford, Creative Director, Dulux UK, commented: 'The colours on our walls are the backdrop to how we live our life. </p>

<p>'For many of us, lockdown has served to emphasise how important our home environment has become, it has been the place where we work, learn, relax. It can lift us up, nurture us, comfort us.</p>

<p>'We continue to live through uncertain times. In 2021, the warm and grounding tones of Brave GroundTM will allow us to find certainty in the strength from the very ground beneath our feet, emboldening us to go forward and begin to live again and giving us the flex to adapt to the ever changing circumstances we face.' </p>

<p>While some praised the 'warm' colours, others branded it 'sludge' and added that it wasn't really' uplifting' (pictured) </p>

<p>However, while many praised the 'warmth' of the colour, others suggested it would've been nice to see something a little more 'uplifting' considering the circumstances. </p>

<p>'It's fair to say 2020 has been pretty rubbish. Then ⁦⁩ come along and make things even worse with this utter sludge of a colour! Really uplifting guys,' wrote one, while a second penned:</p>

<p>'With everything going on in the world you have to admire Dulux's sense of humour bring out Brown as their colour of the year.'</p>

<p>A third added: 'I'm surprised that Dulux's colour of the year is a snoresome beige and not the unrelenting blackness of the abyss that we're all screaming into. <em>shrugs</em>'</p>
