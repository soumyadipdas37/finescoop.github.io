<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Northern Irish teen chose a beautiful spot to pose for a picture - but didn't study her backdrop close enough to notice the football game going on behind her.</p>

<p>Aimee McFadden, 18, and her friend Mia Scullion decided to stop to for a sunset photoshoot in Lurgan, Northern Ireland one evening.</p>

<p>They set up their camera and balanced themselves on a fence, without considering the football pitch behind them.</p>

<p>The pair strike a pose, balancing precariously with one foot in the air, and smiling for the camera. </p>

<p>Behind them, the footballers kick a ball around, until a poor kick sends an accidental stray ball flying towards Aimee. </p>

<p>It hits her full force and boots her right off balance, legs flailing in the air, as she desperately tries to cling onto the fence with one arm.</p>

<p>She falls to the ground but seems unharmed and bursts out laughing along with her friend Mia.</p>

<p>The hilariously fail was caught on camera as the embarrassed footballers hung their heads in shame.</p>

<p>An accidental stray ball comes flying towards Aimee and hits her full force, knocking her off the fence</p>
