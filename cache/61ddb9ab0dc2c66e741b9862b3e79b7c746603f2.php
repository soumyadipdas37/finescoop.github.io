<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bayern Munich are considering making a shock loan move for Atletico Madrid flop Thomas Lemar, according to reports in Germany.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old has struggled to live up to the Â£62million price tag Atletico paid for him two years ago and are now ready to cash-in on the Frenchman.</p>

<p>According to Bild, the European champions could offer Lemar a temporary escape from his Atletico nightmare but the Spanish side would prefer to move him on permanently.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich are reportedly weighing up a loan move for Atletico Madrid's Thomas Lemar</p>

<p>Bayern have already strengthen the left side of midfield with the acquisition of Leroy Sane this summer but Lemar's versatility across the park is proving to be a big selling point for Bayern boss Hansi Flick.</p>

<p>Lemar has plenty of suitors and has reportedly already turned down a move to Porto earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Wolves and Everton are also said to be interested in the World Cup winner, with previous reports suggesting that he would favour a move to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Bayern boss Hansi Flick is looking to bolster his squad before the window closes on Monday</p>

<p>He has previously been linked with clubs such as Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United, but neither are said to be interested in him now.</p>

<p>Lemar has made 73 appearances for Atletico, with his most recent appearance coming in Sunday's 6-1 win over Granada where he was used as a second-half substitute.</p>

<p>Part of France's World Cup-winning squad in 2018, Lemar has just under three years remaining on his current contract with Atletico.</p>
