<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One police officer in Florida was shot and another was injured during a gun battle with a murder suspect who was killed during the exchange of fire, authorities said.</p>

<p>On Saturday the Daytona Beach Police Department released graphic body camera footage that showed the shootout that left Michael A. Harris dead, one officer shot and another injured after falling.</p>

<p>Authorities said Harris, 44, was wanted for attempted murder related to the shooting of a woman at a Travelers Inn on August 18. </p>

<p>During a press conference, Police Chief Craig Capri maintained that his officers responded appropriately.</p>

<p>'[Harris'] intent was to go out in a shootout, not to surrender,' said Capri. </p>

<p>But Harris' family members who've seen footage of the shooting said authorities went too far. </p>

<p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement opened an investigation into the incident. </p>

<p>Footage begins with five officers from Daytona Beach and the Holly Hill Police Department approach an apartment complex on Espanola Avenue on Saturday to serve an arrest warrant. </p>

<p>An anonymous tipster had called 911 at 2.38pm to report the whereabouts of Harris. </p>

<p>The group of men, one of whom has a rifle drawn, set up a perimeter around the complex before approaching apartment 104 in search of Harris. </p>

<p>One woman sitting outside the apartment says she doesn't know Harris, but a man standing nearby tells officers that he may be inside or fleeing through a window. </p>

<p>After a few moments, the officer holding the rifle unlocks the apartment door and encounters Harris, who quickly hides behind a bedroom door in the back of the residence.</p>

<p>Five officers from the Daytona Beach Police Department and Holly Hills Police Department dispatched to an apartment complex in Daytona Beach, Florida, on Saturday</p>

<p>Authorities said they were there to serve an arrest warrant to Michael A. Harris, a murder suspect in Daytona Beach</p>

<p>'Police department, show me your hands!' the officer shouts. </p>

<p>He follows Harris to the bedroom door and kicks it open just as Harris opens fire with a handgun.</p>

<p>The officer screams out in pain as the bullet strikes him in the right chest area, but his bullet proof vest stops any severe injuries.</p>

<p>Michael A. Harris (pictured in mugshot) was shot dead during the exchange of fire with law enforcement on Saturday </p>

<p>'I'm hit!' the officers yells to his colleagues. </p>

<p>Using an adjacent wall as cover, the officer continues to shoot in the general area of the bedroom as a gun battle ensues.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a petrified woman's voice screams out and officers discover a woman was inside the home at the time of the shootout. She repeatedly screams and asks officers to call an ambulance.</p>

<p>When officers remove the woman from the scene, they call for Harris to come out of the bedroom and ask that he show his hands.</p>

<p>It's unclear when exactly Harris was hit by law enforcement, but he does not appear to return fire for at least three minutes of the six-minute shootout.</p>

<p>Authorities discovered Harris' body inside the bedroom and he died from his injuries at the scene.</p>

<p>According to a press release, the officer who was struck in the chest is expected to recover and a second officer was injured after tripping during the incident.</p>

<p>An unidentified officer (pictured) was shot during the gun battle, but was protected by his bullet proof vest</p>

<p>Body camera footage showed that Harris fired a handgun at officers, who returned fire afterwards</p>

<p>'One round struck the ballistic vest of a full-time patrol officer. The vest stopped the bullet from penetrating, leaving him with a bruise in the right chest area. He is expected to recover after he went to Halifax Health Medical Center (HHMC) for treatment,' the release read. </p>

<p>'Another full-time DBPD officer on scene tripped and fell outside of the apartment while shots were being fired. </p>

<p>'Paramedics took him to HHMC, where he is being treated for injuries to his head and neck. He remains in stable condition and should recover from his injuries.'</p>

<p>Both officers have been placed paid administrative leave while the Florida Department of Law Enforcement reviews the matter, which is standard in officer-involved shootings.</p>

<p>Neither officers' identities have been released due to the ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>Authorities discovered Harris had died during the gun battle and found his body inside a bedroom </p>

<p>At the press conference, Police Chief Capri defended his department's response to the shooting.</p>

<p>'If you pull a gun on a police officer and shoot a police officer, you're going to get killed. Simple as that,' said Capri.</p>

<p>'I can't make that any clearer, we don't want to take a life , we want to save lives but when you pull a gun and there's video, you can see that he tried to murder these police officers.'</p>

<p>He said that the officers had not intended to kill Harris, but had opened fire in response to the suspect. </p>

<p>'He had a warrant for his arrest. All he had to do was surrender peacefully and go to jail and let the criminal justice system play itself out. </p>

<p>'But he took it on his own abilities to try and kill police officers. And we don't get paid to get killed.  </p>

<p>Chief Craig Capri speaks to reporters about a fatal officer involved shooting earlier today. Two of our officers were injured in the incident. MORE: http://www.codb.us/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=936</p>

<p>Capri admitted that he was proud of his officers and the work local enforcement has done. </p>

<p>'It’s like I said, 99.99% of officers in this country do the same thing, and people want to all of us as being bad under the same brush,' he said.</p>

<p>'We’ve been attacked not only in the media but also by several radical groups.</p>

<p>'I’m not going to let the voice of a small few go against us because I know what we stand for'.   </p>

<p>Harris' family told FOX 35 that they've viewed the body camera footage and although they send prayers to the officers, they're wondering why their loved one was killed in such a way.</p>

<p>'He belongs to a family who loved him dearly, in spite of his flaws. When it comes to him, what happened to him is wrong,' his cousin, Victoria Harris, said.</p>

<p>'I'm not justifying whatever happened and prayers go to his family as well, but regardless my cousin didn't deserve to die.' </p>
