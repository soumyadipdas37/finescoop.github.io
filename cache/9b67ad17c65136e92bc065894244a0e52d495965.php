<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump has approved a deal which will see Oracle lead a coalition to buy TikTok from Chinese company ByteDance.</p>

<p>Last month Trump ordered that ByteDance sell TikTok, or else it would be shut down in the United States.</p>

<p>On Saturday, shortly before departing for a campaign rally in North Carolina, the president said he had given the green light to an offer made by California-based Oracle, working in a partnership with Walmart.</p>

<p>'I have given the deal my blessing,' he said, adding that the agreement 'will have nothing to do with China.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'It'll be totally secure, that's part of the deal.' </p>

<p>Donald Trump on Saturday announced that he had approved a deal for Oracle to buy TikTok</p>

<p>The president said the new company would be headquartered in Texas, would hire as many as 25,000 people and would contribute $5 billion toward U.S. education. </p>

<p>The Chinese government must now sign off on the transaction for it to go forward. </p>

<p>On Thursday Trump said his administration had spoken to Walmart and Oracle about TikTok, but at that point there was no agreed deal for the Chinese-owned short video app.</p>

<p>'We're making a decision,' he said on Thursday. </p>

<p>'We spoke today to Walmart, Oracle. I guess Microsoft is still involved.</p>

<p>'We'll make a decision, but nothing much has changed. We'll make a decision soon.' </p>

<p>ByteDance had been racing to clinch a deal with the White House that would stave off a U.S. ban on TikTok that Trump has threatened could happen as early as next week.</p>
