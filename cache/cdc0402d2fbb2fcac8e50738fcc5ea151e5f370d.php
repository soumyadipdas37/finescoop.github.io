<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Having something to look forward to is what we all need right now. And, despite our summer holidays being all but ruined, long-haul trips later this year and into next year look like a much safer bet — and there are some astonishing deals.</p>

<p>Book with a package holiday provider, such as the ones we suggest below, and you’ll be guaranteed a refund or the opportunity to re-book should a coronavirus outbreak happen either here or abroad. </p>

<p>Many of these countries have few cases and are welcoming tourists with open arms.</p>

<p>Caribbean</p>

<p>Travel restrictions can vary between islands in the Caribbean. A seven-night holiday to Secrets St. Martin Resort &amp; Spa on the island of St Martin, pictured, starts from £1,998 on selected dates in December</p>

<p>Caribbean islands make up a large proportion of long-haul destinations on the Foreign Office’s quarantine-free list. They include the Bahamas, BVIs, Bermuda, Barbados, Antigua, Turks and Caicos, St Lucia, St Barts, Jamaica and St Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>

<p>Restrictions vary between islands. The Cayman Islands, which is also on the list and will open to international tourism on September 1, is asking visitors to wear coin-sized ‘biobuttons’ which will ‘passively monitor incoming travellers for early symptoms’ and provide proof of a negative test.</p>

<p>Other islands require tourists to fill out questionnaires, obtain visas or bring thermometers with them so they can report their temperatures twice daily to the authorities.</p>

<p>BA announced last week that it will launch a new route between Gatwick and Jamaica from October 13.</p>
