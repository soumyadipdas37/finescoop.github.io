<p>Showdown: The great debate between which franchise has the biggest and best fan base, between Star Wars and Star Trek, gets a new wrinkle with an ad from UberEats</p>

<p>The ad is set in an abandoned warehouse, as Hamill approaches carrying a baseball bat, clad in black.</p>

<p>He turns to the camera and says, 'Tonight, I'll be eating a veggie cheeseburger on ciabatta, no tomatoes,' as he sees Stewart approaching.</p>

<p>Stewart, clad in a black and grey ensemble and carrying what appears to be a cricket mallet, approaches and looks into the camera.</p>

<p>'Careful, Hamill, daddy's not here to save you,' Stewart says, egging his supposed rival on, while Hamil retorts, 'Oh I am my daddy!'</p>

<p>Naturally, Stewart is quite confused, adding, 'Come again?' as Hamill tries to make sense of it all as well, adding, 'Wait, what? You said, "Daddy's not here to save you..."</p>

<p>'What the hell are you talking about?' Stewart asks, as the ad cuts to an UberEats bag and the tagline, 'Tonight I'll be eating...' as Hamill is heard saying, 'I'm not sure I got that right' as the ad comes to a close.</p>
