<p>'I still cringe to this day': Australia's Next Top Model's Amanda Ware has reflected on the moment host Sarah Murdoch announced the WRONG winner on the show</p>

<p>'She (Sarah) goes sheet white... I was scared she was going to keel over, and I could hear them saying the winner is Amanda. </p>

<p>'And so Kelsey's obviously started making her speech, the fireworks have gone off. Honestly, I still cringe today. Even you saying it - my heart drops,' she told host Gabrielle Scawthorn.</p>

<p>Amanda continued: 'I don't think we realised that we couldn't film it again, I don't know about Kelsey or Sarah. I just know it's the most shocking moment.</p>

<p>'10 years on... I can't even watch it': The model, 28, said, 'I don't think we realised that we couldn't film it again, I don't know about Kelsey or Sarah. I just know it's the most shocking moment'</p>

<p>'Even today, I think it's still on Germany's top ten worst moments of TV ever,' she laughed.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the Brisbane-born beauty said: 'It's still cringeworthy, even now, 10 years on... I can't even watch it... it's so embarrassing.</p>

<p>She added that the moment wasn't embarrassing for herself or Kelsey, saying: 'We didn't stuff up, there's nothing to say we did anything wrong, which is why I'm still sane today. </p>

<p>'It wasn't our stuff up': She added that the moment wasn't embarrassing for herself or Kelsey, saying: 'There's nothing to say we did anything wrong, which is why I'm still sane today' </p>

<p>'But I guess that's what you can take away from it, it wasn't our stuff up,' she concluded.</p>

<p>Amanda also revealed that the iconic ANTM gaffe has still stuck with her a decade on, and says it didn't have a 'detrimental impact' on her career. </p>

<p>'[In] modelling you can kind of fall between the cracks quite easily, and as they kept saying on the show "be a blank canvas", "you can be anything" - but it kind of means boring.</p>

<p>'It helped me stand out from the crowd': Amanda concluded, '[In] modelling you can kind of fall between the cracks quite easily, and as they kept saying on the show "be a blank canvas", "you can be anything" - but it kind of means boring'</p>

<p>'I know that sounds a bit w***y, but moving on in my career that's what I kinda felt helped me stand out from the crowd was the show,' she said.</p>

<p>Since winning the show in 2010, Amanda has continued her successful modelling career, posing for the likes of Hervé Léger, Monique Lhuillier and Kenzo. </p>
