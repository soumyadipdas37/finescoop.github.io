<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jacob Rees-Mogg is self-isolating after one of his six children started showing coronavirus symptoms.</p>

<p>The Leader of the House of Commons is remaining at home while waiting for the results of a Covid-19 test.  </p>

<p>One of his children - Peter, 12, Mary, 11, Thomas, ten, Anselm, eight, Alfred, four and Sixtus, three - started exhibiting coronavirus symptoms. </p>

<p>His eldest five children had their first day back at £18,000-a-year school Hill House in London last week. </p>

<p>Tests usually take up to 72 hours to come back but can take longer due to laboratory or processing delays. </p>

<p>Deputy chief whip Stuart Andrew stood in for Rees-Mogg at business questions on Thursday. </p>

<p>Rees-Mogg took to Twitter to explain his absence, writing: 'Many thanks to Stuart Andrew for standing in for me at Business Questions. </p>

<p>Jacob Rees-Mogg's children, in descending order, are Peter, 12, Mary, 11, Thomas, ten, Anselm, eight, and Alfred, out in front, four. The youngest is Sixtus, three</p>

<p>'One of my children was tested for COVID-19 last weekend after displaying symptoms. </p>

<p>'In accordance with government guidance, the household has been in self-isolation while we await the test result.' </p>

<p>Mr Andrew told the Commons: 'A member of the Leader of the House's household is awaiting a Covid test result after having been symptomatic. </p>

<p>'The leader is therefore self-isolating along with his family.' </p>

<p>Rees-Mogg's brood attend Hill House - Prince Charles's alma mater - where fees range from £14,400 for infants to £18,000 for sixth formers. </p>

<p>Rees-Mogg - previously dubbed ‘minister for the last century' - shared a family photograph of his five eldest children in uniform on the morning of their first day back at school last week. </p>

<p>The four oldest siblings were returning to the school, but it was the first day for Alfred. The youngest brother, Sixtus, three, remains at the family home for now.  </p>

<p>His children's full names are: Alfred Wulfric Leyson Pius, Thomas Wentworth Somerset Dunstan, Peter Theodore Alphege, Anselm Charles Fitzwilliam, Mary Anne Charlotte Emma and Sixtus Dominic Boniface Christopher Rees-Mogg.  </p>

<p>The children are looked after by nanny Veronica Crook - who also looked after their father after joining the family before Rees-Mogg was born in 1965.</p>

<p>Rees-Mogg talks openly about how Miss Crook - who once famously campaigned with Mr Rees-Mogg in his mother’s Mercedes - made him the man that he is today. </p>

<p>The beloved nanny 'is still on duty', looking after young Sixtus.</p>

<p>Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, arrives at Downing Street on September 1</p>

<p>Speaking after Sixtus's birth in 2017, Rees-Mogg said: 'Nanny is still looking after the children, which is absolutely wonderful as I hear her telling them things she used to tell me. </p>

<p>A nanny never reveals her age, Mr Rees-Mogg added, but he guessed that Miss Crook is ‘in her seventies’. She does not have a family of her own, he said, but ‘we are her family.’ </p>

<p>Mr Rees-Mogg said his children are as ‘informed’ about politics as he was as a child and regularly join him on the doorstep. </p>

<p>‘If we campaign on the Saturday morning along the High Street, there’s a toy shop there. So they join me for a bit and then I join them in the toy shop and everybody is happy,’ he previously said.</p>

<p>Hill House in London's Knightsbridge has 900 pupils who wear its distinctive uniform of burgundy breeches and mustard-coloured tops</p>

<p>When asked whether this amounted to a bribe, he said: ‘I wouldn’t quite describe it like that.’</p>

<p>There was nothing to suggest that his children may follow a different kind of politics than his own, he added.</p>

<p>‘As children do, they come up with these things and you think, where did they get that from? It is one of the joys of parenthood,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘But they have not yet come up with anything that suggests I have a nascent Socialist on my hands.’</p>

<p>He also holds quizzes for his children around the Sunday lunch table after church, as his father William Rees-Mogg used to do.</p>

<p>Speaking to Event Magazine in 2019, he said: 'One of the quizzes we have is that we do the catechism, because the three eldest are all taking their First Communion soon. </p>

<p>'Sunday lunch, if we haven't got guests – I don't inflict it on guests – we go through the Penny Catechism, and the children know the answers.'</p>
