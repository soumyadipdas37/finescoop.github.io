<p>'Unfortunately this morning it was brought to my attention that the two boys have broken the COVID guidelines in terms of our secure bubble - had to decide they couldn’t have interaction with the rest of the team,' Southgate told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'Nothing has happened in the areas we occupy in the hotel. We are still getting the depths of the information. Still getting to grips with the detail. We have spent such a long time getting measures in place and the whole squad followed that to the letter.</p>

<p>'I’m not going into any more details until I’m clear of everything. No-one from outside the hotel has been into the areas we occupy.'</p>
