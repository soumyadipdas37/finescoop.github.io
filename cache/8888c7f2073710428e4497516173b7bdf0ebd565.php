<p>It comes after the cricketer discussed Mollie in a recent interview with Mail On Sunday. </p>

<p>He said: 'Being restricted to my home in Nottingham for the longest stretch I can remember in my career has meant I have gone from international cricket to playing against my girlfriend Mollie, who has become quite good at batting, posting her efforts on Instagram.</p>

<p>Having fun: Stuart got some cricket practice in the pool</p>

<p>'She has been very enthusiastic. Some might say a bit too enthusiastic on occasion — like when she bowled the ball over the net, which is between 10-12 feet high, and cleared the hedge, too. Next-door didn't give it back, either!'</p>

<p>He continued: 'When we first met, Mollie didn't know anything about cricket. But she has tried hard to pick things up.</p>

<p>'For example, during one of the first Test matches I played when we were together, I received a text message from her saying: "Well done today. I thought X was the key wicket, and a real breakthrough for the team."  </p>

<p>'She had copied it off the BBC Sport website's live blog!' </p>

<p>Mollie previously dated model David Gandy between April 2011 and February 2012, with the pair rekindling their romance in 2014. They finally split two years later.</p>
