<p>Yet another complained: 'Is anyone gonna sing, or get unmasked tonight?'</p>

<p>Another added: 'That's it switching off they know if they advertised the format of this show people would NEVER have tuned in. Turn.It.Off.'  </p>

<p>One more agreed: 'Switching channels briefly to the yawnfest that is tonight's #MaskedSingerAU, I'm glad I'm watching #PlateOfOrigin'. </p>
