<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you're looking for a way to help tone and shape your bum, arms and thighs, a resistance band can help you achieve some surprisingly effective results. </p>

<p>No need for a studio or weights, resistance bands are perfect for home workouts (ideal for when we can't bring ourselves to leave for the gym).</p>

<p>Effective and affordable, shoppers are particularly loving the Amonax Resistance Bands Set. Reduced to just £5.06 on Amazon, down from £11.95, the bands are a super affordable way of taking your workouts to the next level.  </p>

<p>Now better-than-half-price, the Amonax Resistance Bands Set are a cheap alternative to weights, helping you to tone and shape your body </p>

<p>If you're looking to tone up and build endurance, resistance bands like the Amonax Resistance Bands Set are a fantastic tool. </p>

<p>Incredibly versatile, you can use them on their own to target a specific area like your glutes or thighs, or incorporate them into standard exercises to vary your resistance, making them that bit harder.</p>

<p>The bands come in a set of four, all representing a different level of resistance. They can be used for all parts of the body, whether you want to work the outer thighs, glutes, back, chest or abs. Unlike dumbbells, these take up barely any space and are super-transportable so you can take them to the park or to the gym.</p>

<p>One gripe with traditional rubber resistance band are that they can occasionally roll or slip during a workout. The Amonax bands are 30 per cent thicker than regular bands so few shoppers have reported bunching or snapping. </p>

<p>It's worth noting that these bands are made out of latex so if you suffer from latex allergies you will be better off with a fabric resistance band.  </p>

<p>The bands range from light, medium, heavy and extra heavy so you can customise your own workouts, tailoring them to your needs and ability </p>

<p>Boasting a wider, more comfortable fit, they grip onto leggings without falling down. One shopper wrote: 'These are great! I have used them for online Pilates classes. They do not roll up or dig in like other bands I’ve used in the past and they stay in place. I used the pink and peach for arm work and the black around my legs for squats.. very effective! They also come in a nice pouch.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, impressed with the versatility of the Amonax Resistance Bands, they added: 'Love these for building a booty! I ordered these bands as I have seen everyone using them at home to help with glute building and toning exercises and I am so happy I did! </p>

<p>'They have made a huge difference to my home workouts whilst I’m unable to get in the gym. They are easy to use and with all the different weight options in one pack you can do every exercise from deadlifts to squats and lunges. Highly recommended!' </p>

<p>A third commented: 'Good quality, thick bands, looks durable enough. Each band has a different levels of resistance, and I found this useful to be used on different body parts. I am using them mainly for my upper body, a good alternative to weights, and they are much much lighter to be carried around.'</p>
