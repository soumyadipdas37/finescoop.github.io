<p>Wow: The X Factor winner, 22, looked amazing as she took to Instagram to model the barely-there two-piece in a series of sizzling snaps</p>

<p>Louisa's post comes after she claimed the UK's lockdown 'saved [her] in a lot of ways' as it made her learn to look after herself and helped her manage her anxiety. </p>

<p>The X Factor star spoke exclusively with MailOnline last month, and detailed the benefits of having time to work on herself and her career while staying indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Reflecting on her lockdown experience Louisa, who was speaking at Hotels.com Dream Screen, explained that she used it in a 'positive way' as she said: 'It actually helped my anxiety a little bit, only because I was at home and was just relaxing.</p>

<p>'I didn’t need to be anywhere or do anything so I kind of just had the time to myself and really worked on me and I think that really, really helped. I think it was kind of necessary actually.</p>

<p>'I think lockdown, as weird as it sounds, probably saved me in a lot of ways because as I’ve said I had that time to myself and I’ve learned about myself a lot more and things became a lot clearer to me, just in many different ways. I definitely think it helped me.</p>

<p>'Things became clearer and I just got the time to look after myself and focus on myself, workout, eat good, get some routine and some structure, which I think for anybody with anxiety I think it’s really important to have that structure in their lives.' </p>

<p>Louisa admitted that she did find lockdown 'hard' at first, as she went on: 'It was a bit of a weird one for everybody because it was just something that we’ve never been used to before but after a few weeks of feeling absolute rubbish I just sorted myself out and tried to get a bit of a routine.</p>

<p>'And since then it’s been okay, I’m back in the studio now which is so much better because I can go places and do things and be back in work mode that I have missed. It’s nice to have a routine, I do find it hard not having a routine so back into it finally.' </p>

<p>Going on to discuss her new music, Louisa claimed her vision for her forthcoming album was 'flipped on its head' following lockdown as her style of music and writing has changed during the period of self-reflection.</p>

<p>'I always said to myself, and the people who support me and my music, that I want it to really be like a diary,' she explained. 'I really want it to be real, and I want to tell people my life experiences through song. </p>

<p>'I think each song is going to be a diary entry in a way which I’m really excited about, because I just feel like it’s going to give people a real insight into myself as a person. I feel like no one really knows me.'</p>

<p>Candid: Louisa's post comes after she claimed the UK's lockdown 'saved [her] in a lot of ways' as it made her learn to look after herself and helped her manage her anxiety</p>

<p>Rise to fame: The X Factor star spoke exclusively with MailOnline, and detailed the benefits of having time to work on herself and her career while staying indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic (pictured 2016)</p>

<p>Louisa, who shot to fame at the age of 17 after winning the twelfth series of The X Factor, said she was keen for her fans to see her true self, one that she didn't get to show them on the reality competition show.</p>

<p>She explained: 'I was so young then. I’m not going to lie I don’t even remember half of my career because I was just all over the place and I was so young, and I had a lot of anxiety and what have you. </p>

<p>'I feel like the past year and a half, two years, I’ve just really been a lot more focused.</p>

<p>'Don’t get me wrong there’s been a lot of ups and downs but I feel a better sense of who I am as an artist and who I’ve always been inside that I’ve never really got to show anyone.'</p>
