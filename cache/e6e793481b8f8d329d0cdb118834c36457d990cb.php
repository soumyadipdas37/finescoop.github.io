<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Libertines rocker Pete Doherty has been banned from driving after riding an electric scooter in the middle of the night while searching for one of his dogs.</p>

<p>The musician, who was already on a driving ban after totting up more than 12 points on his licence last year, says he had no idea he was not allowed to ride the e-scooter while disqualified.</p>

<p>But the singer, who lives in Margate, Kent, and runs a hotel in the seaside town, was stopped by police in the early hours of the morning as he rode on a path at 1.40am on October 3.</p>

<p>It emerged during a hearing at Margate Magistrates Court on Friday that before the offence Doherty had been told by police officers - who had stopped him in nearby Broadstairs for selfies - that he was fine to ride it as long as he stayed on the pavement.</p>

<p>He was then stopped again by police attending a 999 call when they saw him riding on the path with his two dogs in the middle of the night, when he was heading home after finding his missing pooch.</p>

<p>The musician (pictured outside court on Friday) who was already on a driving ban after totting up more than 12 points on his licence last year, says he had no idea he was not allowed to ride the e-scooter while disqualified.</p>

<p>Officers asked him to show an insurance certificate, which he was unable to provide but he was sent on his way.</p>

<p>Paul Shingleton, representing Doherty, said it was not until several months later his client received a court summons on charges of driving while disqualified and without insurance.</p>

<p>Mr Shingleton told the court: 'It was not very clear to all and sundry what the rules were.</p>

<p>'His dog had escaped and he went to find him and he was on his way back home when he was stopped by police.</p>

<p>'It wasn't a case of someone [who is disqualified] driving a car in defiance. The case has an oddness about it with some unusual factors.'</p>

<p>Doherty, 41, pleaded guilty to both charges as well as to another charge of driving a car without insurance in August, before his initial ban.</p>

<p>He received a £2,000 fine for each offence, totalling £6,000, and was given six points on his licence, taking him over the 12 point limit, meaning a two-year disqualification from driving.</p>

<p>On sentencing, the magistrate said the two stops by police had 'misled' Doherty into thinking it was OK to still drive the scooter.</p>

<p>He added: 'It was a poor exchange - a couple of selfies for some bad information.'</p>

<p>Doherty has had numerous brushes with the law, mainly for drug offences, during his rock career.</p>

<p>Last November Doherty was arrested in Paris on drugs possession charges and fined for allegedly trying to buy cocaine.</p>

<p>In October, the former Babyshambles frontman blamed a broken dashboard light after he was caught speeding four times in just three weeks.</p>

<p>He told Follkestone Magistrates' Court he could not see how fast he was driving each time he was flashed by a speed camera on the same 30mph stretch in Cliftonville, Kent.</p>

<p>In May 2019, he was forced to stay in hospital after being pricked by a hedgehog when a spine got stuck in his finger while out walking his dogs near his home.</p>
