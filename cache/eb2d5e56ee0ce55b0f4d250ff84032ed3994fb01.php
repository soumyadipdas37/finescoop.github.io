<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A car enthusiast who spent decades searching for his first family car was left stunned when he accidentally stumbled upon it parked under an old apple tree in a paddock. </p>

<p>Kim Valentine, of Hobart, was just a newly wed with a baby on the way when he bought the honey-brown Volkswagen Beetle in the early 1970s for just $2,000.</p>

<p>But as his family began to grow, he was forced to trade it in for a bigger car.</p>

<p>The 72-year-old had always wondered what had happened to the honey-coloured bug that had meant so much for the family. </p>

<p>He spent 48 years looking for it but never had any luck, that was until a chance encounter during a day trip to Bruny Island, south of Hobart, on September 7. </p>

<p>'I spied a honey-brown Beetle under an apple tree, up to its ankles — or its hub caps — in grass, and I wondered what the rego number on that car was,' he said.  </p>

<p>Kim Valentine (pictured), of Hobart, was in utter disbelief when he stumbled across the honey-brown car hubcap-deep in grass on vacant land during a day trip to Bruny Island</p>

<p>Mr Valentine was 'so excited' he got into the driver's seat (pictured) to recollect the good ol' days</p>

<p>'I jumped out of the car, ran across this little empty block of land and was amazed when I saw its number plate.</p>

<p>'I've often seen honey-brown VW beetles but invariably they have been the 1600cc fastback version - not the 1500.</p>

<p>'I could not believe my eyes.' </p>

<p>Mr Valentine was 'so excited' he got into the driver's seat to recollect the good ol' days.</p>

<p>'I sat behind the wheel and looked back at where we used to put the bassinet of our first child, Chris, when he was a baby,' he said. </p>

<p>'I have a lot of really great memories with that car.'</p>

<p>Mr Valentine fondly remembers trips with his family in the 'bug', including a time he became bogged near a creek at Orford.</p>

<p>He paid $2,000 for the car - almost half his annual wage of $4,500 - in 1972 before selling it five years later when his family grew. </p>

<p>'It just kept going and going and going,' Mr Valentine said. 'VWs are incredibly versatile.</p>

<p>'Its number plate - CA4 936 - is the only one I remember out of all the cars I've had.' </p>

<p>Mr Valentine's 48-year-old son Chris, who now lives in Darwin and is a father of four, can also remember being placed in the bassinet in the backseat as a baby.</p>

<p>'I remember that car,' he told Mr Valentine's in a text message.  </p>

<p>Mr Valentine can vividly and fondly remember trips with his family in the 'bug' (pictured), including a time he became bogged near a creek at Orford</p>

<p>'I have very fond memories of driving home at night and staring out the back window looking up at the stars.'</p>

<p>Mr Valentine's daughter - his second eldest child - remembers the car too, despite being about 18 months old at the time.</p>

<p>'I have no idea how they remember it but it's amazing, isn't it?' Mr Valentine said.</p>

<p>'They never mentioned anything until I brought it up so I was pretty amazed.'</p>

<p>Friends of Mr Valentine shared photos of the car in its heyday when he posted the unexpected find on Facebook, saying 'How amazing is this?'. </p>

<p>'I remember riding in the back many times,' one person commented under the post.</p>

<p>'Isn't that amazing! We also drove a VW beetle, same colour, in 1975/6. Can't recall the rego though,' another wrote. </p>

<p>'Offer them 50 bucks,' another exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mr Valentine, however, confirmed he had no plans to take the little beetle home for restoration as it was 'sitting nicely' and 'looking out at the water'. </p>

<p>His discovery was the second time he found a long-lost but never forgotten item from his former years.</p>

<p>'Another time I found a beanbag  I used to own that was repaired after being too close to the wood heater. I donated it to an OP shop in late 70s and saw it again in 1988,' Mr Valentine said.</p>

<p>'It was in front of a fire at a place we were staying called The Vine.'    </p>

<p>Mr Valentine said his discovery was the second time he found a long-lost but never forgotten item from his former years. Pictured: Mr Valentine responding to comments under his Facebook post</p>
