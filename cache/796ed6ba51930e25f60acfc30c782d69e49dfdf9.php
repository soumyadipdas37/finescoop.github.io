<p>Speaking to WSFM's Jonesy And Amanda last month, Jennifer insisted that she and her builder husband are nothing like 'flippers' - a term describing people who buy and quickly resell properties for the purpose of generating profit.</p>

<p>'We don't really house flip. I don't know where that [came from],' the mother-of-one said, adding that her decisions to purchase and offload properties have always been motivated by 'life changes' rather than profit.</p>

<p>'It's kind of like, we would just find an amazing piece of land. Jake's a builder so we had that passion, and then something in our life would change and we'd want to move to a different area,' she explained.</p>

<p>'So we would sell it after maybe three to four, five years. But it seems like a quick amount of time, but yeah, no definitely not house flipping,' Jennifer added.</p>

<p>Jennifer and Jake's latest reported new renovation property, was previously owned by Dame Joan Sutherland and is the peninsula's largest oceanfront estate.</p>

<p>It was listed in 2018 for $8million, but failed to sell and ­returned to the market earlier this year.</p>

<p>The spacious home is set on 3,100sqm of land with expansive ocean and coastal views. Daily Mail Australia have contacted Jennifer Hawkins for comment.</p>

<p>Jennifer first entered the property market in 2006, two years after she was crowned Miss Universe.</p>

<p>The beauty forked out $469,000 for a double-storey house in Merewether, a suburb located in her home city of Newcastle.</p>

<p>She leased out the three-bedroom, two-bathroom property for much of the time it was in her name, before she eventually sold the residence for $782,000 in 2017.</p>

<p>Clearly bitten by the real estate bug, savvy Jennifer added two properties to her portfolio in 2007.</p>

<p>In January of that year, she bought another home in Newcastle's Merewether area for the sum of $620,000.</p>

<p>Like her first property close by, the house was double-storey and featured three bedrooms and two bathrooms.</p>

<p>It appeared they tired of the eastern suburbs some time later, selling the property in 2014 for $1.2 million.</p>

<p>By this time, Jennifer and Jake had already begun to build homes, rather than simply buy them.</p>

<p>In 2010, the couple purchased a cliff-side block of land in North Curl Curl for a whopping $1.3 million.</p>

<p>They then partnered with renowned architect Koichi Takada to create a stunning three-storey mansion.</p>

<p>The couple sold the North Curl Curl home in 2014, for a jaw-dropping $4.1 million.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Jennifer and Jake bought another block of land in the same suburb and had already commenced building another incredible mansion.</p>

<p>They paid $1.66 million in 2013 for the block, which had an old weatherboard house on it.</p>

<p>The couple demolished the house, before Jake's company J Group project again collaborated with Koichi Takada to build another home.</p>

<p>Jennifer and Jake sold the North Curl Curl residence for around $5 million in 2016.</p>

<p>The couple then traded up to their latest pad, a mansion located in Sydney's exclusive Northern Beaches suburb of Newport.</p>

<p>The home was built on a plot of land bought for $4 million by the couple in 2014.</p>

<p>Jennifer and Jake sold the stunning mansion for $20 million in June this year, six months after listing it on the market. </p>

<p>Billionaire software tycoon Mike Cannon-Brookes and his wife Annie purchased the mansion for a record $24.5million. </p>
