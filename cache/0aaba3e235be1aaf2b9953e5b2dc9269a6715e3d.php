<p>The world No 108 was three over for his third round when he made his way to the par-four last, leaving himself a four-footer for par.</p>

<p>However, the Kiwi failed to hole-out on five separate occasions from four feet as determination to finish the job off increasingly turned into frustration and lacklustre putts.</p>

<p>He knocked his first putt so far past the hole that he faced an even longer putt coming back for bogey.</p>

<p>His second effort failed to reach the hole while his third putt then travelled nearly seven feet beyond the target. </p>

<p>But the world No 108 failed to hole-out on five separate occasions from four feet</p>

<p>He knocked his first putt way beyond the hole while his second failed to reach it all together</p>

<p>Lee's following attempt stopped under four feet from the cup, while his eighth shot in total went further past the target than any of his efforts beforehand.</p>

<p>He eventually holed-out from seven feet seven inches - the longest putt of them all - causing him to settle for a quintuple bogey nine on the 18th hole.</p>

<p>However, his frustration did not end there as after the six-putt from four feet saw him close out an eight-over 78, the former Presidents Cup player was captured slamming his club down against his bag in frustration before he cited a wrist injury for his withdrawal from the tournament.</p>

<p>His third putt also went far beyond the target and it took him another three attempts</p>

<p>But the drama did not end there as he slammed his club against his bag after in frustration</p>

<p>Social media users however took delight in Lee's misery, with one stating: 'Nothing better than seeing professionals acting unprofessional. Thank you Danny Lee for this shining moment.'</p>

<p>Another user also mocked Lee, adding: 'Aside from the professional golfer thing there are zero differences between myself and Danny Lee', while another hinted at some sympathy by stating: 'We're all Danny Lee. Most of us just don't have disposable putters or bags.' </p>

<p>Lee's unforgettable finish saw him slip to 13 over for the week, while his withdrawal meant that only 61 players featured in Sunday's final round as Bryson DeChambeau claimed his first title.</p>
