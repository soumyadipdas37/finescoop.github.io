<p>He said our youth was confronting a 'uniquely challenging' time amid the uncertainty of the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>In a rare intervention, Charles said the 'destructive hopelessness' of unemployment is facing Britain's youngsters once again.</p>

<p>Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, he said the young are in particular need of measures to protect them from the worst effects of the crisis, adding that the country must not let optimism 'drown beneath a deluge' of economic predictions.</p>

<p>The royal, who is a long-standing supporter of domestic abuse charities in the UK and overseas, visited a not-for-profit organisation that supports those affected by domestic violence across Belfast and Lisburn</p>

<p>He added that while it is 'all too easy to assume that nothing can be done… the task ahead is unquestionably vast, but it is not insurmountable.</p>

<p>'There has never been a time as uniquely challenging as the present, when the pandemic has left perhaps another million young people needing urgent help.' </p>

<p>Reflecting on how he founded the Prince's Trust charity in 1976, with the severance pay he got from the Royal Navy, Charles added: 'I am old enough to remember other times when hope was scarce and pessimism seemed the only thing in abundant supply. </p>

<p>The Duchess smiled as she met with staff, supporters and service users of Women's Aid in Belfast</p>

<p>During the visit, Camilla heard about the challenges they faced by the those using the service in recent months</p>

<p>The royal beamed as she spoke with members of staff and service users joining her visit to Northern Ireland today </p>

<p>'In the mid-Seventies, when I left the Royal Navy, youth unemployment was one of the pressing issues of the time. It seemed to me that we should do something to try to make a difference, however small.'</p>

<p>The Prince's Trust, has just helped its millionth young person, with research from the Trust showing that 55 per cent of 16 to 25-year-olds are more worried about being unemployed than they were a year ago.</p>

<p>The Prince's Trust set up the Young People Relief Fund in the immediate aftermath of the pandemic to provide extra support to those hit by the economic fall-out.</p>
