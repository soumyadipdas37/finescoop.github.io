<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Her doting mum Billie Faiers spent weeks planning the perfect lockdown birthday party fit for a princess turning six.</p>

<p>And Nelly Shepherd's special day turned out spectacularly with the little girl being treated to a garden filled with pastel coloured balloons, donuts and candyfloss.</p>

<p>However it was her baby brother Arthur, three, who stole Thursday night's episode of The Mummy Diaries, with fans laughing at the cheeky tot's behaviour.</p>

<p>Party time! Nelly Shepherd, six, was treated to an amazing Candyland themed birthday at her home in Essex during Thursday night's episode of the Mummy Diaries</p>

<p>Nelly's birthday party boasted a stylish set-up in the back garden of her Essex home, with Billie having planned a low seating area and balloon display.</p>

<p>On the guest list were auntie Sam and Paul as well as their children Paul and Rosie, with nanny Sue also bringing the birthday girl herself to the event after a sleepover. </p>

<p>The children were seen enjoying themselves as they played and Greg handed out sweet pink candy-floss.  </p>

<p>However fans were left crying with laughter after Arthur featured in several funny moments during the show - including when he picked up a water gun and set his sights on dad Greg.</p>

<p>Cheeky! However it was Nelly's little brother Arthur who stole the show with his hilarious jokes and sayings</p>

<p>Prankster: The three-year-old sprayed his dad Greg with a water gun during one scene</p>

<p>After jumping around on Nelly's new huge bouncy castle the little boy sneaked up on his father and sprayed him with the gun.</p>

<p>Laughing at his adorable son, Greg joked that he was going to throw Arthur in the hot tub before he ran away.</p>

<p>But Arthur wasn't ready to surrender yet, instead coming back to spray Greg two more times.</p>

<p>Greg said with a smile: 'I like to think of myself as a prankster, and I think Arthur's following his dad's footsteps'  </p>

<p>Little joker: Arthur also opted for running instead of riding his bike, leaving that up to Greg</p>

<p>Putting in the effort: He also made sure to wish his sister happy bithday in style by dressing up as Spiderman</p>

<p>Adorable: The youngster did a thumbs up as he enjoyed a huge pink lolly at Nelly's party</p>

<p>Arthur also proved he's a star in front of the camera during the family's attempt at learning how to ride bikes.</p>

<p>Nelly, who recently had her stabilisers off and was getting to grips with balancing on two wheels, managed to roll along by herself after a few attempt.</p>

<p>But her little brother didn't appear very interested in learning about his own bike, instead opting to run around when he peddled backwards. </p>

<p>Speaking about the children Billie and Greg said: 'Arthur, bless him, he's alright going down a hill - then he gets it.' </p>

<p>Lucky girl! Nelly was given a bouncy castle by her doting dad Greg as she turned six</p>

<p>So much fun! The duo were joined by their cousins Paul and Rosie for a go on the huge castle</p>

<p>Amazing! Nelly appeared to be very impressed with her birthday gift</p>

<p>Later on in the episode the family also got to move back into their home which had just had a new kitchen put in.</p>

<p>Arthur was impressed with the fancy new white cupboards and gold taps, even hilariously picking up a toy screwdriver to do some 'finishing touches' to the oven.   </p>

<p>Fans loved seeing Arthur's cheeky side during the episode, with many taking to Twitter to say he was their favourite.</p>

<p>Love it! Fans were delighted with Arthur's cheeky personality during the show, with many declaring him their favourite</p>

<p>One person wrote: 'Say it every time I watch Mummy Diaries but Nelly and Arthur are actual screams I love them so much'</p>

<p>While another added: 'Arthur is the star of the show.' </p>

<p>During the show Billie discussed how she had been worried that Nelly may not enjoy the party as she could be expecting something on a larger scale.</p>

<p>Pretty pastels: Billie spent weeks planning the garden party for Nelly, arranging a low seating area and pretty balloon display</p>

<p>What a cake! A very impressive cake with ice creams on top was also presented to Nelly</p>

<p>Look at this! Nelly couldn't wait to show auntie Sam her back garden birthday party</p>

<p>Billie explained: 'Nelly said to me "so there were 100 at my birthday last year, so how about 90 this year?" and I thought, "not really try losing the zero", but she's going to love having all her nearest and dearest there anyway.'</p>

<p>Greg also agreed that it was nice to be doing something on a smaller scale, sating that it's more 'relaxed' as usually things can get a bit 'ridiculous' with the 'whole school class and cousins. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sam and Paul worried about sending their eldest son to school and decided that it would be good for him to attend summer camp for a week.</p>

<p>Although hesitant at first little Paul ended up loving his taste of school and making lots of friends.'  </p>

<p>Reunited: The sisters and their beau's were finally able to do something together after lockdown in Thursday's episode</p>
