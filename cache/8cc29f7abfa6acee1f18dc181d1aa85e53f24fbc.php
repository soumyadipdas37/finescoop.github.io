<p>The former Celebrity Juice star, 39, opted for a laid back look for the shoot, sporting a black printed T-shirt with matching skinny jeans and black trainers. </p>

<p>Daisy shot to fame for her role as Marianne in Normal People, where she starred opposite Paul Mescal as two Irish college students who fall in love.</p>

<p>Previously discussing her role in the series with Harper's Bazaar, she said: 'I'm really proud of it. It's so raw and honest. </p>

<p>'We're not just seeing a glossy, honeymoon portrayal of love, we're seeing the rust of life. It's the truth of growing up.' </p>

<p>All smiles: TV presenter Fearne Cotton, 39, was pictured taking a break from work in a recording studio</p>

<p>Speaking about her sex scenes with Paul, who portrayed Connell in the series, she insisted: 'It was about creating a real friendship with Paul so we could trust each other.</p>

<p>'I'm lucky he and I understand each other and have a very similar sense of humour. Neither Paul nor I are ever sexualised in those moments. It's just a story of young love.'</p>

<p>Daisy confessed that when she landed the role of Marianne in Normal People, she was struck with Imposter Syndrome.</p>

<p>She said: 'It was bl**dy terrifying. When I got the part, I was very excited. Then I had the fear settle in, the imposter syndrome of thinking, have they actually got it wrong?</p>

<p>'I learnt a lot during filming about being more confident in my voice and not feeling like I have to quieten it.'</p>

<p>Speaking about the upcoming fundraiser, Daisy said: 'Macmillan is always there for those of us who need support, and now more than ever they need our help to do their vital work. </p>

<p>'Having a Coffee Morning for Macmillan is a fun and easy way to raise money for a great cause and, even though this year things are a little different, it’s still important that we have a cuppa for Macmillan if we can, wherever we are, and give them our love and support.'</p>

<p>The stars’ support comes at the most critical time in Macmillan’s history, as it faces losing a third of its fundraising income due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>People can show their support in a series of different ways; whether by hosting a safe and socially distanced stall on their doorstep - adhering to coronavirus guidelines, organising a virtual get-together, taking on a fitness challenge or by donating and Raising a Mug for a selfie online. </p>

<p>People can also join in by buying one of the limited-edition M&amp;S products or having a personal coffee morning at an M&amp;S café where a 5p donation from every hot coffee and slice of cake in September goes to Macmillan. </p>
