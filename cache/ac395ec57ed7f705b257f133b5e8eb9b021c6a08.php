<p>Manu's footage shows Matt, who is wearing a white shirt and his signature cravat, sleeping soundly while holding a phone and sitting on a blue velvet couch. </p>

<p>'Even Matt falls asleep when he listens to himself,' Manu captioned the candid video.</p>

<p>The footage caught the attention of several TV stars, including The Block's Mark McKie and Mitch Edwards, who joked that Matt had been 'working too hard'. </p>

<p>'Exclusive BTS footage. He's clearly not sleeping, he's just thinking deeply ... #PlateofOriginAU,' Many added.</p>

<p>Manu then shared another clip of Matt, which showed him looking worse for wear in his pajamas, as a woman speaking another language can be heard on his phone.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Frenchman mocked his sleepy friend by imitating a loud snore.</p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>mattscravat is so clever. He can also learn how to speak another language in his sleep ... #PlateofOriginAU,' he wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>No hard feelings! Matt reacted to Manu's post with good humour, saying he had fallen asleep while listening to the radio backstage</p>

<p>Matt reacted to Manu's post with good humour by making fun of himself in a post shared to his own Instagram account on Tuesday.</p>

<p>In the footage, he pointed out that he was listening to the radio when he fell asleep.</p>
