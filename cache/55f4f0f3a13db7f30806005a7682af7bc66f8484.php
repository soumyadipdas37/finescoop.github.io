<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The ECB are slashing their workforce in a bid to claw back a fifth off their wage output, as they respond to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>In a statement, ECB chief executive Tom Harrison said English cricket was ‘facing its most significant challenge of the modern era,’ warning that this year’s losses could double to £200million if next summer’s programmes were similarly hit.</p>

<p>‘We must reduce the cost base across the game - and that requires the ECB to lead the way by reducing its own cost base,’ Harrison said.</p>

<p>ECB chief executive Tom Harrison announced 62 roles will be removed from their structure</p>

<p>‘Given this new reality, if we are to safeguard cricket’s long-term future and still deliver on the growth ambitions of our Inspiring Generations strategy, it is clear the ECB will need to become a leaner and more agile organisation.</p>

<p>‘Over recent weeks we have thoroughly reviewed the ECB’s structures and budgets in order to reduce central costs without compromising on our ambitions. We have now shared with colleagues our board-approved proposals, which will generate significant savings.</p>

<p>‘Every part of the ECB is affected by these changes, and these savings will only be possible by reducing our headcount.</p>

<p>‘These proposals include a 20% reduction in our workforce budget, which will equate to the removal of 62 roles from our structure – a number which is largely made up of existing headcount and a small number of vacant positions.’</p>

<p>Harrison said they must reduce the cost base across the game to safeguard cricket's future</p>
