<p>'What's really funny about it is that you say years ago, it was 24 years ago, that's what's shocking to us, we are like, "We met 24 years ago?"' the 59-year-old Oscar winner marveled on Monday's episode of The Drew Barrymore Show.</p>

<p>'The only thing I can say is I think that you both have to really want to be married. I do feel like I've seen situations where things aren't working out for people because one member of the couple doesn't want to be there. I think if you are both invested in it working out that's important. </p>

<p>'We met 24 years ago!' Julianne Moore shared secrets to her lasting 17-year marriage to second husband Bart Freundlich, whom she originally met in 1996 when he directed her in The Myth of Fingerprints (pictured August 23)</p>

<p>The 59-year-old Oscar winner said on Monday's episode of The Drew Barrymore Show: 'You both have to really want to be married. I do feel like I've seen situations where things aren't working out for people because one member of the couple doesn't want to be there'</p>

<p>'You really have to have a good time. My god, I think they have to make you laugh, if they don't make you laugh it's just deadly. And somebody asked me the other day if it felt long a long time and I was like, "Oddly no it doesn't." That's what has been nice about it, it doesn't feel like a long time.'</p>

<p>Moore and the 50-year-old Sundance Grand Jury Prize nominee are officially empty nesters now that their 22-year-old son Caleb and 18-year-old daughter Liv are both busy in college.</p>

<p>Caleb is pursuing a master's degree in music/screen scoring at NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development.</p>

<p>And Liv is a freshman attending Northwestern University in Illinois.    </p>

<p>Moore continued: 'You really have to have a good time. My god, I think they have to make you laugh, if they don't make you laugh it's just deadly'</p>

<p>Julianne marveled: 'Somebody asked me the other day if it felt long a long time and I was like, "Oddly no it doesn't." That's what has been nice about it, it doesn't feel like a long time'</p>

<p>'My babies': The After the Wedding actress and the 50-year-old Sundance Grand Jury Prize nominee are officially empty nesters now that their 22-year-old son Caleb (L) and 18-year-old daughter Liv (R) are both busy in college (pictured August 31)</p>

<p>Julianne (born Julie Anne Smith) divorced her first husband, stage director John Gould Rubin, in 1995 after nine years of marriage.</p>

<p>The After the Wedding actress next plays feminist icon Gloria Steinem (after age 40) in Julie Taymor's biopic The Glorias, which starts streaming this Wednesday on Amazon Prime Video/VOD.</p>

<p>'One of the things that really struck me about Gloria is that she's not reactive, she's not rash,' Moore said on the syndicated CBS talk show.</p>

<p>'People said really horrific things to her, they just loaded it on her. She always came from a point, she would listen, she would wait, then she would respond but she never responded with any kind of heat, she always responded with intellect. </p>

<p>Double take: Moore next plays feminist icon Gloria Steinem (after age 40) in Julie Taymor's biopic The Glorias, which starts streaming this Wednesday on Amazon Prime Video/VOD </p>

<p>Julianne said on the syndicated CBS talk show: 'I really think when I'm talking to people, I'm like, "What would Gloria do? How would she react?" Maybe take the time to be more like her'</p>

<p>Based on Steinem's 2015 memoir My Life on the Road: The femninist flick depicts surreal scenes where four Glorias - including Alicia Vikander (2-R), Lulu Wilson (2-L), and Ryan Kira Armstrong (L) - all interact on screen at once</p>

<p>'And she wasn't cruel to anyone ever and incredibly tolerant of other people's views. I do think about that, I really think when I'm talking to people, I'm like, "What would Gloria do? How would she react?" Maybe take the time to be more like her.'</p>
