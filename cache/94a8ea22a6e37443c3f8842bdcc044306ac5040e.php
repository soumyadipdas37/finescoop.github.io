<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>With the Premier League set to return later this month, clubs have been revealing their new kits - and some have been among the worst ever seen.</p>

<p>Chelsea and Manchester United are particularly guilty, with their efforts already arguably deserving a place in the all-time hall of shame.</p>

<p>The Blues unveiled a bizarre new alternate shirt for the 2020-21 season with red and blue stripes as they claimed it was 'inspired by the 1990s Ultramarine Air Max 180 and classic shirts of the past'. Everyone else has quickly pointed out that it seemed to be inspired by Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Chelsea have revealed their new third kid for the 2020-21 season with blue and red stripes </p>

<p>One fan referred to new the strip as 'the worst kit we've produced for over 20 years'. Another expressed his disappointment saying: 'So many good signings and they all have to play their first game in this hideous shirt.' </p>

<p>United, meanwhile, have launched their new zebra-themed third kit, which has generated scathing reviews from supporters on social media.</p>

<p>Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>Topps1765 said: 'Wouldn't put my name on that embarrassment of a third kit, not even if I got it for free' and another tweeted: 'Who the hell signed off the third kit? It's horrendous!' </p>

<p>One fan moaned: 'Even David Beckham can't make it look good,' while another said: 'People will use it to cross the road!'  </p>

<p>Manchester United's kit resembles a zebra and has not gone down well with fans</p>

<p>Former United star David Beckham posted a photo on his Instagram wearing the new shirt</p>

<p>These kits are destined to live long in the memory but for all the wrong reasons, just like United's infamous 1995 'invisible' kit or Norwich City's 'useless' 2015-2019 third strip. </p>

<p>This is Sportsmail's pick of the 10 worst kits to have featured in the English top-flight over the years.... until now!</p>

<p>Having created their first ever third kit for a Premier League campaign, the design ended up being rather useless as the colours clashed with both Norwich's home and away kits</p>

<p>Their third kit boasted a striking hooped design featuring the traditional club colours of green and yellow, and more besides.</p>

<p>Head of retail at the club, Steve Balmer-Walters, tried to explain the thought process behind the shirt at the time, saying: 'The hoops represent connecting with the community, and the shirt is all about having fun in the community. This shirt is going to be like marmite; you'll either love it or hate it and that’s the fun of it.'</p>

<p>Safe to say, we hate it.  </p>

<p>Norwich City's 2015-16 third kit was pointless as it clashed with both their home and away kit</p>

<p>Manchester City's sky blue kit is one of the Premier League's most instantly recognisable, but their design team must have featured a temporary lapse in judgement when deciding their 2008-2009 away kit, featuring an overpowering amount of orange, as well as a seemingly random sleeve of dark blue that wound its way round the collar and under the armpit. Plus a squiggly yellow line.</p>

<p>No, us neither. </p>

<p>Manchester City had an overpowering amount of orange in this rather random kit</p>

<p>Not one for the faint-hearted with its bright pink with purple stripes.</p>

<p>If that wasn't offensive enough, the skin-tight strip included diagonal lines to add to the chaos. </p>

<p>No wonder Sunderland went down that year. </p>

<p>Sunderland's third kit for their 2016-2017 campaign was a prurple and pink monstrosity</p>

<p>Tottenham's 2006-2007 third kit featured what could possibly be one of the worst colours seen in the English top flight.  </p>

<p>The colour combination of chocolate brown, gold and red is absolutely unforgivable.  </p>

<p>Particularly for the likes of poor old Dimitar Berbatov and Jermain Defoe, who had the misfortune of having to wear it. </p>

<p>Tottenham's 2006-2007 brown third kit featured one of the worst colours seen in the top flight</p>

<p>Mido and Robbie Keane look delighted... but it's not because of Tottenham's kit</p>

<p>Ian Wright will certainly have enjoyed being the top scorer for Arsenal in 1991, but the legendary striker might not have been all that pleased with how he looked while banging those goals in. </p>

<p>Draped in yellow, black and pink, Arsenal's kit replicated somewhat a bruised banana. </p>

<p>Perhaps the dazzling patterns were enough to send the opposition into a psychedelic meltdown, allowing Arsenal to finish fourth in the league. </p>

<p>If clubs could have been relegated for the state of their kit, Coventry would have been shown the door before the Premier League even began. </p>

<p>This Coventry kit sported blue and white splodges and flecks. Imagine something you might see spread over the table at your grandma's house, mixed with Tetris shapes.</p>

<p>Roy Wegerle in Coventry's 1992-94 home kit, which somehow made white and blue chaotic</p>

<p>Another strong Norwich contender for worst club kit in history. The 1992-1994 home kit featured a chaotic design that boasted their famous yellow-and-green colours.  </p>

<p>That being said, there are positive memories for the club while playing in this kit. The likes of Chris Sutton, Efan Ekoku, Jeremy Goss and Mark Robins graced the pitch in their elaborate jersey during their impressive mid-90s campaign that saw then finish third in the Premier League and beat Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup. </p>

<p>Norwich dazzled on the pitch in more ways than one while wearing this daring design</p>

<p>The strip that has gone down in Premier League folklore after Sir Alex Ferguson famously ordered his players to change out of the grey number after they came in at half time 3-0 down away to Southampton in April 1996.</p>

<p>Fergie claimed that the grey shirt was so dull that his players couldn’t pick each other out from the background of the crowd, and sent them back out wearing their blue and white striped away kit instead.</p>

<p>United did actually win the second half 1-0 but that could not prevent a dismal defeat and one of the club's most embarrassing moments ever. </p>

<p>Who knows who Eric Cantona was passing the ball to here at The Dell in 1996?</p>

<p>Middlesbrough's 1996-1997 squad boasted flair with Brazilians Juninho and Emerson fronting up their attack. However, the club's white and speckled blue kit was not quite so impressive, especially as the coloured part only adorned certain sections of the shirt.</p>

<p>The club's away strip that year was also tarnished with a giant, tacky 'BORO' on the sleeve. </p>

<p>Relegation beckoned for both club and kit. </p>

<p>Legendary Brazilian Juninho featured in Middlesbrough's white and speckled blue kit</p>

<p>Where on earth do you start with this one?</p>

<p>Coventry were guilty of having one of the ugliest kits in English football history once again. </p>

<p>With a thick white collar, this old-school shirt boasted an 'in your face red and white' design with a marbled effect and a bunch of splodges.</p>

<p>Simply: why? </p>

<p>Coventry were guilty of having one of the ugliest kits in English football history once again</p>

<p>Coventry defender Phil Babb (right) looks like he's ready to rip Trevor Francis's shirt off here - possibly so he can wear it over the top of his own horrific kit to hide it</p>
