<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Primary school teachers are being given resources to encourage male students to tuck their penis or wear a padded bra to appear more feminine. </p>

<p>Links on the School Biz portal for teachers, provided by the NSW Department of Education, transfer to a 40-page booklet titled 'OMG I'm Trans'.</p>

<p>It also includes a series of other materials on gender fluidity and same-sex relationships, including fictional books called 'The Gender Fairy, Are you a Boy or Are you a Girl' and 'Sex Is A Funny Word: A Book About Bodies, Feelings and You'. </p>

<p>The public education body said the links are operated by third parties and the materials were deemed safe for children in an independent review in 2016.</p>

<p>But in a series of explosive tweets on Wednesday, One Nation MP Mark Latham accused the government of reinstating the controversial Safe Schools program 'by stealth'.</p>

<p>One Nation MP Mark Latham (pictured) accused the government of reinstating the controversial Safe Schools program 'by stealth'</p>

<p>'NSW Govt supposedly abolished Safe Schools in 2017 but Education Dept staff kept working on compiling a full library of this rubbish from around the world,' Mr Latham wrote on Twitter</p>

<p>Safe Schools included the idea that gender is a 'non-binary' or 'fluid' concept, as part of queer gender theory.</p>

<p>The program was plagued with accusations from critics who believed the ideas on gender theory were too radical for children since its introduction in 2010.</p>

<p>It was eventually axed in 2017, but Mr Latham claims the government have sneakily brought it back.</p>

<p>'NSW Govt supposedly abolished Safe Schools in 2017 but Education Dept staff kept working on compiling a full library of this rubbish from around the world,' he wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>'They sent it to teachers behind Internet wall. The public was not supposed to find out.'  </p>

<p>OMG I'm Trans contains information on gender pronouns, same-sex relationships and how to disguise gender.</p>

<p>It suggests young males wear bra inserts, 'tuck' their penis to 'create a flat front in the pants', and 'pack' their backside to make it appear larger and more feminine.</p>

<p>The lengthy PDF also has information for young girls about 'binding' breasts to appear more masculine. </p>

<p>A spokesman for the Federal Department of Education said the materials were found to be age-appropriate (stock image of a woman with a primary school-aged child)</p>

<p>'It's absolutely brought back by stealth,' Mr Latham told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'Behind a firewall they are sending information to teachers which resurrects Safe Schools despite the government ending it. There was a reason this was kicked out of schools in the first place. There has been no disclosure.'</p>

<p>Institute of Public Affairs director of the Foundations of Western Civilisation Program Dr Bella d'Abrera shared Mr Latham's opinion and said the resources are 'social engineering'.</p>

<p>She also said teachers should not be 'politicising impressionable children' in the classroom'.</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Federal Department of Education said the materials were found to be age-appropriate and aligned with the Australian curriculum.</p>

<p>'The resources were originally published in 2013 as part of the original Safe Schools Hub that was funded by the previous Labor Government,' he said. </p>

<p>Following the independent review in 2016, the resources were returned to the hub.   </p>
