<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A middle-aged man has admitted to beating and stabbing his elderly parents to death in the house the trio shared in southern Sydney. </p>

<p>David Reid, 47, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter in the New South Wales Supreme Court on Friday. </p>

<p>The IT worker killed his mother Dianna Reid, 71, and father Victor Graham Reid, 75, in their Sutherland home in August 2019. </p>

<p>His defence barrister said there is a 'significant medical issue that needs to be explored' and said four psychiatrists are set to testify at a February sentencing hearing, according to The Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>Reid was arrested at the Tudar Rd property in the south Sydney suburb of Bonnet Bay after he called police and allegedly threatened self-harm. </p>

<p>He led officers inside the house where they discovered his parents' bodies. </p>

<p>Police said his parents died from 'multiple injuries.' </p>

<p>After he was arrested he spent five days in hospital with serious injuries on his hand and was later put on suicide watch while in custody.  </p>

<p>David Reid (pictured)  has been charged with murder after his elderly parents were found dead at their home on August 6</p>

<p>Reid is in a vulnerable position in custody and needs protection as he recovers from injuries sustained during the alleged attack, according to his barrister </p>

<p>Reid, who had worked for casino gaming manufacturer Konami for the past 20 years, had reportedly battled mental health issues in the past.</p>

<p>Concerns were raised last week when Reid showed up at work acting 'more strange than usual'.</p>

<p>He had 'a noticeable amount of blood' on the back of his neck and shirt collar when he arrived at his Botany office on last Monday, a colleague told the Sydney Morning Herald. </p>

<p>The worker said no one wanted to ask him about the blood as his behaviour had changed. </p>

<p>Mr and Mrs Reid had been members of their local Jannali Anglican Church for more than 50 years. </p>

<p>Neighbours say Reid had been living with his parents his entire life. </p>

<p>Dianna Reid and her husband Victor Graham Reid were found dead in the family home last Tuesday </p>
