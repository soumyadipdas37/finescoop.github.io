<p>Lucy Fagg, 16, had been subjected to name-calling after the breakdown of a relationship before she killed herself at a station in Sturry, near Canterbury in Kent, on March 6</p>

<p>The inquest at Maidstone County Hall heard how the sporty and ambitious girl, who dreamed of becoming a zookeeper when she left school, had been feeling down.</p>

<p>On the day of her death, she had been 'a little bit down' after having to sit an exam in a separate room to her classmates.</p>

<p>After school, she had gone for a meal with a friend in Canterbury to 'cheer her up' before catching a bus home. Her friend told how Lucy had 'skipped off, blowing kisses to him as she got off the bus'.</p>

<p>Lucy returned to her home before telling her mother she was going to the supermarket to buy some fruit.</p>

<p>Rebecca Saunders, who led BTP's investigation, told the inquest that during that time Lucy received a social media message which had left her upset, telling another friend she was 'done'.</p>

<p>Deeply concerned, her friend rushed with her own mother to Sturry railway station, knowing Lucy had been there before intending to harm herself.</p>

<p>As they were stuck behind the level crossing barriers, they frantically tried to get the attention of others at the station to alert them to Lucy, who was on the platform.</p>

<p>But Lucy was sadly struck by a train after stepping in front of it. She was pronounced dead at the scene.</p>

<p>Following Lucy's death, her aunt found an eight-page letter she had written on a notepad in her bedroom.</p>

<p>Dated March 1, it contained messages addressed to her family, friends and teachers indicating she no longer wanted to live.</p>

<p>On the day she died, a friend who was worried about Lucy's state of mind rushed to meet her at the station — but was stuck on the wrong side of the crossing barriers as a train approached. An inquest yesterday heard she watched helplessly as Lucy stepped in front of a train</p>

<p>Recording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Catherine Wood said it was clear Lucy's intention was to end her life.</p>

<p>Following her death, Lucy's devastated family paid tribute to the teenager, who was the youngest of three children.</p>

<p>Lucy's older sister, Sophie, 19, remembered her as 'kind-hearted' and a 'beautiful young woman'.</p>

<p>She added: 'She was the sweetest, most kind-hearted girl in the world; the most innocent and lovely girl you could have met.</p>

<p>'She was so beautiful and had a truly wonderful soul. Lucy did anything she could for anyone. She was an amazing sister.</p>

<p>'She was always giggling, that amazing little giggle that I yearn to hear once more.'</p>

<p>Her mother Tammy, 43, described their much-loved girl as an all-rounder who 'achieved everything she set her mind to'.</p>

<p>Following the tragedy, British Transport Police carried out an investigation which revealed the events leading up to the death of the teenager — described by her family as 'the sweetest, most kind-hearted girl in the world' (pictured, with her father Stuart)</p>

<p>She said: 'There was no failing in Lucy's book. Once she achieved something, that was that, next project.</p>

<p>'It was like a little bucket list — 'I wanted to do that, done it, I wanted to do that, done it'. She had to give things the best she had.</p>

<p>'There's not a sport she wasn't good at — diving, fishing, long jump, gymnastics.'</p>

<p>As a life-long animal lover, Lucy had a treasured pet chihuahua, Rosie, and a budgie named Kiwi, which she taught to speak.</p>

<p>She dreamed of turning her passion into a career, and had been offered a place at college to work with animals after finishing her GCSEs, with the aim of becoming a zookeeper.</p>

<p>Lucy was also an avid Liverpool fan who 'would never miss a game for anything', and a talented angler, who regularly spent weekends fishing with her dad at Chartham and District Angling Society.</p>
