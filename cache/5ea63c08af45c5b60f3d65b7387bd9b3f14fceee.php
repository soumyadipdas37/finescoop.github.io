<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sebastian Vettel is set to confirm he will drive for Racing Point next season after Sergio Perez announced he is no longer wanted by the team.</p>

<p>Mexican Perez revealed his departure ahead of this weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix after seven years with the Silverstone-based outfit.</p>

<p>Racing Point will be rebranded as Aston Martin next season and four-time world champion Vettel, deemed surplus to requirements by Ferrari, is now likely to head up the project.</p>

<p>Sebastian Vettel is set to drive for Racing Point next season, replacing Sergio Perez</p>

<p>Perez revealed his departure ahead of this weekend's Tuscan Grand Prix after seven years</p>

<p>The 33-year-old German is set to team up with Lance Stroll, the son of Lawrence Stroll, a co-owner of the team. An announcement could be made as early as Thursday.</p>

<p>Perez, 30, played a key role in helping Racing Point, previously known as Force India, from going out of business in 2018.</p>

<p>'Everything in life always has a beginning and an end, and after seven years together, my time with the team will come to an end after the season,' said Perez.</p>

<p>'It hurts a bit as I bet on the team during very rough times. We managed to overcome obstacles and I am very proud of saving the jobs of several of my team-mates.</p>

<p>'I'll keep the memories of the great moments lived together, the friendships and the satisfaction of always giving my all.</p>

<p>'I will always be grateful for the opportunity given to me by [former owner] Vijay Mallya, who believed in me in 2014 and allowed me to continue my F1 career with Force India.</p>

<p>'To the current administration, led by Lawrence Stroll, I wish nothing but the best in the future, especially with the upcoming Aston Martin project.'</p>

<p>Vettel has been deemed surplus to requirements by Ferrari and is struggling on the track</p>

<p>Racing Point team principal Otmar Szafnauer added: 'Sergio has been part of the Silverstone family for seven years and in that time has become one of the most complete drivers on the grid.</p>

<p>'Blisteringly quick on Saturday and Sunday, he's established his reputation as a tenacious racer and together we have enjoyed some fantastic moments. It's been a pleasure working with him for such a long time.'</p>

<p>Vettel heads into Ferrari's 1,000th Grand Prix this weekend a lowly 13th in the championship.</p>

<p>He will be replaced by McLaren's Carlos Sainz at Ferrari next year following Charles Leclerc's emergence as the Italian team's pick to end a drivers' championship drought which stretches back to 2007.</p>

<p>But Vettel, who won four consecutive championships with Red Bull between 2010 and 2013, is now set for a fresh challenge.</p>

<p>For Perez, he could be handed a lifeline at Alfa Romeo with veteran Kimi Raikkonen's future beyond this year in doubt. American team Haas could also be an option.</p>
