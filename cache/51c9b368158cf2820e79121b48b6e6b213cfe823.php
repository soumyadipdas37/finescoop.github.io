<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An 89-year-old grandfather has died days after being 'king hit' at his nursing home by another resident and suffering a broken neck, his family claims. </p>

<p>War veteran Robert Driver had been in his walker at the Macquarie View aged care facility at Bolton Point, Lake Macquarie, NSW, about 7pm when a dementia patient allegedly hit him from behind, knocking him to the ground.</p>

<p>'That evening my father was hit from behind by another client of the dementia ward in a totally unprovoked and surprise attack,' daughter Julie-Anne Jones told the Sunday Telegraph.</p>

<p>Macquarie View aged care facility at Bolton Point, Lake Macquarie, NSW where the shocking alleged attack occurred on the evening of August 20 </p>

<p>The family was told that the person who hit Mr Driver was known to be aggressive and had recently been transferred from another facility, Mrs Jones said.</p>

<p>Mrs Jones said her father, a former army lieutenant who also served with the RAAF was not taken to hospital immediately after the punch on August 20, but instead was put to bed for the evening.</p>

<p>The following day-he had difficulty breathing and a stiff neck and was taken to John Hunter Hospital, where it was discovered his neck was broken.</p>

<p>The break was in a critical juncture of the cervical cord which affected his breathing, and the hospital told the family they did not expect Mr Driver to survive.</p>

<p>He was transferred back to the nursing home to die, which he did on August 25, five days after being punched.</p>

<p>A post-mortem showed Mr Driver died from a cervical spinal injury and police are investigating the death.</p>

<p>NSW Police are investigating the alleged attack by a dementia patient in a nursing home</p>

<p>'Why was my father put to bed and not taken directly to hospital? Everyone knows if you have a concussion you do not lay down,' Mrs Jones said.</p>

<p>'We want accountability for this incident. This was totally preventable.'</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia contacted aged care home operator Bolton Clarke for a response on Sunday.     </p>

<p>Bolton Clarke chief operating officer David Swain told the Sunday Telegraph that management were working with both NSW Police and with the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission after the incident.  </p>

<p>Mr Swain said both men had been residents of the special care dementia unit for residents with higher needs.</p>

<p>Registered nurses were on site and available at all hours, supported by clinical teams, he said, and a staff member had been present and responded immediately. </p>

<p>NSW Police said the alleged attack took place at 7pm on August 20, they were awaiting the results of the post mortem and that a report would be prepared for the coroner.</p>
