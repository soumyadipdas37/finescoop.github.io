<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Coronavirus likely arrived in Los Angeles before Christmas of last year - and may have been circulating in the area months before the first case was officially diagnosed, new research suggests. </p>

<p>Doctors at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Health found a spike patients with cough and lung failure beginning in December, which continued through February. </p>

<p>During those months, there were 50 percent more of these cases than the hospital system had seend during that period for the previous five years. </p>

<p>The study suggests that between December and February, there may have been as many as 1,000 coronavirus patients in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Los Angeles hospitals saw 50% more coughing patients in December 2019 through February 2020 than in years prior (bottom, orange) and 18 more cases of lung failure than usual (top) </p>

<p>Nearly 250,000 Angelinos have now been diagnosed with COVID-19. </p>

<p>The populous  California county is still seeing nearly 700 new cases a day, although its new daily infections are finally starting to decline. </p>

<p>More than 6,000 people have died of COVID-19 in Los Angeles, with another fatalities reported yesterday. </p>

<p>The first coronavirus case in LA county was identified on January 26, in a 38-year-old man from Wuhan who was only in the city for a layover at LAX with his family on their way home from vacation in Mexico. </p>

<p>His illness hit suddenly while at the massive airport on January 22, and he asked a customs officer for help. He was whisked away to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center where his location was known to few for weeks, the Los Angeles Times reported. </p>

<p>It was a busy flu season for county hospitals, but for five weeks, the traveler remained the only coronavirus case in LA. </p>

<p>A second case wasn't confirmed in the county until March 3. The next day, California's governor, Gavin Newsom, declared a statewide of emergency. </p>

<p>But the new study, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, suggests that some of those suspected flu cases keeping the LA emergency rooms busy were actually COVID-19. </p>

<p>The UCLA team's analyzed more than 10 million patient records from between December 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020. </p>

<p>The first case of coronavirus in Los Angeles was not detected until January 26, when a passenger flying through LAX (airport pictured; patient not pictured) was whisked away to isolation </p>

<p>Visits to clinics for coughs exceeded the average number of outpatient visits for similar complaints during that same period by more than 50 percent. </p>

<p>Coughs were cropping up in similarly higher numbers in ERs, too. </p>

<p>And 18 more patients than  would have been expected in a typical year had to be hospitalized for acute respiratory failure.   </p>

<p>The researchers noted that, at the time, LA hospitals were also seeing more cases  of cough and respiratory illness suspected of being caused by vaping, although rates  e-cigarette use had started falling in the county since September 2019. </p>

<p>'We may never truly know if these excess patients represented early and undetected COVID-19 cases in our area,' said lead study author Dr Joann Elmore, a internal medicine professor at UCLA. </p>

<p>Emergency rooms (bottom) and outpatient clinics (top) saw a steep spike in visits for cough starting in December 2019 and continuing to February 2020 (blue) </p>

<p>But her findings suggest that at least some cases of cough and respiratory distress in LA were linked to the pandemic - and keeping an eye out for similar upticks could help health officials identify outbreaks of COVID-19.  </p>

<p>'The pandemic has really highlighted our need for agile health care analytics that enable real-time symptom and disease surveillance using electronic health records data,' said Dr Michael Pfeffer, a study co-author and chief information officer for UCLA Health. </p>

<p>'Technology, including artificial intelligence powered by machine learning, has further potential to identify and track irregular changes in health data, including significant excesses of patients with specific disease-type presentations in the weeks or months prior to an outbreak.' </p>
