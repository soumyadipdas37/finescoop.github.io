<p>A video shows Russian traffic police giving chase to the Toyota Сamry on the outskirts of Moscow.</p>

<p>The high speed spin lasted around three hours before the vehicle crashed into a highway barrier at 5:30am.</p>

<p>A 13-year-old took the keys to his father's car, leading police on a high-speed chase for around three hours, before finally crashing into a barrier on the motorway, wrecking the car (pictured)</p>

<p>Schoolboy Lev, a go-karting fanatic, was the one to take the keys, and picked up two friends - girl Polina, 12, and boy Zakhar, 13. All three suffered injuries and required treatment in hospital, but miraculously survived the crash</p>

<p>Schoolboy Lev, a go-karting fanatic, took the keys of the Toyota and picked up two friends, girl Polina, 12, and boy Zakhar, 13.</p>

<p>Police tailed the trio after Lev refused to stop at a police checkpoint in Krasnogorsk.</p>

<p>Officers said the Toyota's speed reached 200 kilometres an hour - or 125 mph - with the driver 'deftly' overtaking while well exceeding the speed limit.</p>

<p>But Lev finally lost control, ramming a barrier on the busy Minsk highway, a motorway that runs between Moscow and Minsk in Belarus.</p>

<p>He suffered multiple injuries but escaped the smoking car. </p>

<p>Zakhar crashed through the windscreen but fortunately only suffered minor wounds, while Polina broke several ribs. All three required hospital treatment.</p>

<p>One report said it was 'miraculous' the children had survived with the car severely damaged.</p>

<p>Lev took his father's car to pick up two friends - Polina, 12 (left) and Zakhar, 13 (right). Zakhar crashed through the windscreen but fortunately only suffered minor wounds, while Polina broke several ribs. And all three required hospital treatment</p>

<p>The children's parents have not commented, but Zakhar's grandmother Irina said: 'The traffic police noticed them and gave chase.</p>

<p>'But how did they turn to be on the Minsk motorway? I don't know how they got there. I don't know. They were scared, they had to stop.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Russian Investigative Committee said the action of the police in staging a high speed chase will be investigated amid fears it encouraged the teenage driver to go even faster.</p>

<p>Lev, pictured on a quad-bike, refused to stop at a police checkpoint in Krasnogorsk, taking the police on a chase that lasted almost three hours</p>

<p>'One of the accident victims took his stepfather's car without his knowledge and called two of his friends to drive around Moscow,' the spokesman said.</p>

<p>'During the trip, due to a violation of traffic rules, the children's car was pursued by a crew of traffic police officers.</p>

<p>'The teenager lost control of the steering wheel and crashed into a barrier. A check will provide a legal assessment of the actions of the police officers.'</p>
