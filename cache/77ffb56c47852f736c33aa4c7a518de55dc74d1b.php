<p>Only 21 days ago the Brazilian helped Bayern smash his parent club 8-2 in the Champions League quarter-finals before going on to lift the trophy with his adopted German side.  </p>

<p>But now he's back in Spain with Barcelona and the club posted pictures of the technically gifted midfielder on the training pitch again. </p>

<p>In one photo Coutinho is seen giving a thumbs up to the camera while wearing his protective mask. </p>

<p>And another shows the 28-year-old running with the ball as his team-mates work in the background.  </p>

<p>Coutinho scored a brace for Bayern in the 8-2 mauling, leading to Quique Setien being sacked by the beaten side. </p>

<p>The attacking midfielder has returned to his parent club after the fruitful loan in Germany </p>

<p>It was assumed that the former Liverpool man would be moving on to pastures new this summer in what is expected to be a mass clearout at the Nou Camp. </p>

<p>Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal, Leicester and Newcastle have all been linked with his signature. </p>

<p>But Ronald Koeman could yet make use of Coutinho and find a place for him in his first team plans with so many senior players seemingly heading for the exit.  </p>

<p>With the Lionel Messi transfer saga engulfing the club, Barcelona are set for a summer of turmoil and where the pieces lay at the end, including Coutinho, still very much remains to be seen. </p>

<p>New Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman could yet find a place for Coutinho in his plans </p>
