<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A chart-topping French rapper is under investigation over his song lyrics after several elected officials and organisations accused him of promoting anti-Semitism. </p>

<p>Freeze Corleone, 28, released his debut studio album LMF last week and a music video for one of his songs posted on YouTube that Friday has already amassed more than a million views. </p>

<p>In an announcement on Thursday afternoon, Paris Prosecutor Remy Heitz said Corleone was being investigated for 'inciting racial hatred' based on the content of his songs and videos posted online.</p>

<p>Senegal-based French rapper Freeze Corleone, 28, is now under investigation over the content of his lyrics and videos. Dozens of politicians and organisations have accused him of promoting anti-Semitism</p>

<p>LMF, the rapper's (pictured above in blue jacket) debut solo album, was released last week and one video has more than a million views on YouTube. He has made no official statement on the investigation that was announced on Thursday but posted a cryptic Tweet apparently comparing the situation to the farcical television serious South Park</p>

<p>Frederic Potier, the interministerial delegate for the fight against racism, anti-Semitism and anti-LGBT hatred (Dilcrah), had earlier announced he had reported the rapper to the public prosecutor's office.</p>

<p>He said he did so after having identified nine passages that he said were criminal.</p>

<p>The International League against Racism and Anti-Semitism, known by its French acronym Licra, condemned Corleone and the music industry promoting him.</p>

<p>'Impunity must end. We call on all partner actors to take responsibility,' the organisation wrote on Twitter, tagging music streaming sites and apps including Google Play and Apple Music.</p>

<p>The investigations and accusations of inciting hatred come as Freeze Corleone's debut album climbed to the top of the French charts</p>

<p>About 50 politicians with President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party condemned the rapper on Thursday, as several of his songs climbed to the top of the country's music charts. </p>

<p>A number of individual politicians also called on digital platforms to remove Corleone's songs and for radio stations to ban them from broadcast. </p>

<p>Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin also called on Facebook and Twitter 'not to spread this rubbish.'  </p>

<p>Freeze Corleone is the stage name used by French-born Issa Lorenzo Diakhate, who lives in Senegal.</p>

<p>The rapper appeared to acknowledge the investigation in a Twitter post on Thursday.</p>

<p>He said: 'I wake up and we're in a South Park episode'. </p>

<p>One follower commented that the reference to the popular adult cartoon series - which often courts controversy and features a character who frequently denigrates his friend for being Jewish - was 'the best summary of the absurdity of the situation. </p>
