<p>Elies Gunenez, 36, originally from Paris, was arrested in Thailand on Wednesday and accused of raping a 29-year-old British backpacker on the night of September 7</p>

<p>The Briton says she met Gunenez (pictured during his arrest) on Tinder before agreeing to a date in a beach bar. They then went back to a hotel, where she claims she was raped</p>

<p>Police said that Guenez had been married to a Thai woman but had recently divorced after he lost his job due to coronavirus. </p>

<p>Later that evening the pair went back to her hotel room, where she alleges that she was raped three times by Guenez, using force.</p>

<p>The alleged victim contacted the British Embassy the next day, September 8, and was taken to hospital for medical checks for supporting evidence. </p>

<p>She showed doctors her wrists, which she said had been injured during the rape. </p>

<p>A police complaint was lodged on Friday, September 11, and officers issued an arrest arrant and began searching for the suspect. </p>

<p>Police began searching for Guenez, and on Wednesday received information that he was driving a white Nissan Juke towards the town of Chalong.</p>

<p>Officers set off to find him before noticing his car driving in the opposite direction, according to The Phuket News.</p>

<p>Gunenez (pictured centre), a divorcee who recently lost his job during the pandemic, has admitted having sex with the woman but denies rape, saying the encounter was consensual </p>

<p>They pulled a U-turn to follow his car, then radioed ahead to a police checkpoint and asked the officers stationed there to stop him and check his ID.</p>

<p>After confirming that the man was Guenez, police arrested him on suspicion of the 'rape of a person over 15 years old by use of threat or force'.</p>

<p>Police say that Guenez has admitted having sex with the woman, but has denied rape. He is being held in custody pending further investigation. </p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Chompunoot Anantayakul said: 'This is a serious case and we are gathering all of the evidence available, including from CCTV cameras and from the suspect's phone. </p>

<p>'The victim was travelling and came to Thailand as a tourist before looking for a job as a teacher. She finally found one in Nakhon Sawan province in the north. </p>

<p>'The tourist contacted the British Embassy after the incident, who assisted her with visiting the hospital and making a police report. </p>

<p>'We have a duty to take care of every tourist in Thailand and we will ensure that the case proceeds correctly. </p>

<p>'I want to thank the British media for their interest in the case and for showing the work that the Thai police are doing to ensure the safety of their citizens.'</p>
