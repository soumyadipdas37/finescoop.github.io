<p>Baby bump: Pregnant Camilla Thurlow treated her fans to something of a progress report on Monday, when she took to Instagram to share a snap of herself cradling her baby bump</p>

<p>With her glossy brown locks styled in a sleek blowout, the mother-to-be further glammed up her look with gold earrings and a light slick of dewy makeup.</p>

<p>She shared the snap as part of a sponsored post for a florist − and couldn't resist making a quip about the 30th week of her pregnancy, stating she was 'in full bloom'.</p>

<p>Camilla's post comes after she admitted there have been 'ups and downs' with her pregnancy, but that she's 'very happy' while talking to Andi Peters on Lorraine. </p>

<p>Happy families: She is expecting baby number one with model Jamie Jewitt who she met on Love Island in 2017 </p>

<p>The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.</p>

<p>She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust. </p>

<p>'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. </p>

<p>'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.</p>

<p>'There's been ups and downs': Camilla Thurlow discussed her pregnancy on Lorraine on Thursday and admitted to feeling 'social dislocation' after working as a bomb disposal expert</p>

<p>'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'</p>

<p>Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World </p>

<p>The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.</p>

<p>She said: 'I feel like I had got to a point where I had enough space to reflect on those times with Halo that were perhaps trickier and have the opportunity to turn that into something I could explain to others.</p>

<p>New: Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World - a memoir about finding courage at work and in her personal life. Pictured with Andi Peters</p>

<p>'I've always wanted to write a book and the last few years have been about working out how to do that.</p>

<p>'I came back from Afghanistan and I struggled with social dislocation, and was struggling to process the events I'd seen.</p>

<p>'I was struggling to connect with my friends and family. I couldn't work out how to balance everything. </p>

<p>'I knew at that point I wasn't maintain healthy relationship and I was trying to figure out a balance between the two. </p>

<p>Exciting time: Camilla has been sharing a steady stream of baby bump pictures on social media and has said she is 'very very happy'</p>

<p>She said: 'I was approached by one of the [Love Island] researchers, and just went through the process, it was going on in the background while I was really struggling. </p>

<p>'So when they asked if I'd be in the opening cast I think if you're struggling with socialising, Love Island offers quite an immersive experience to talk and there are no other distractions.</p>

<p>'I had seen some episodes I think I tried to watch a few when they first contacted me, it was really interesting. </p>

<p>'You can watch the show but when you're in it it's an entirely different experience, you forget about the cameras and what you see and what it's like.' </p>

<p>Something for herself: Camilla was approached to go on Love Island at a time when she said she was 'struggling' after returning  from Afghanistan </p>
