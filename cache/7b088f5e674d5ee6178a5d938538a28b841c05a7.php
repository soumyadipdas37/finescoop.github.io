<p>Clean living:  This release will soon join their portfolio of clean, vegan wines made with organic grapes and without unnecessary additives</p>

<p>The star met Katherine through her sister in law Nicole Richie and the friendship blossomed.</p>

<p>In April 2018 they began studying the wine world and questioned what went into their favorite beverage.</p>

<p>'I actually figured it was the most responsible alcohol choice because it was made with fermented grapes. But I had no idea of the process. One of the first conversations Katherine and I had about making a cleaner wine was "what are we doing to add in?" we soon learned it wasn't what you added, it's what you didn't add,' said Diaz.</p>

<p> HIT: Inspired by the support and enthusiasm, Power and Diaz accelerated the Red launch</p>

<p>'Launching with a white and rosé, the wines are clean, delicious, vegan-friendly, made with organic grapes and free of unnecessary additives. With ingredient transparency on each label, Avaline aims to set a new standard for the wine industry,' boasts the press release.  </p>

<p>On Friday Michael Osborn, Founder &amp; Executive Vice President of Wine.com shared: 'Avaline is performing very well with the Wine.com audience, specifically attracting the quintessential millennial consumer. To have nearly 4,000 of our customers purchase this item in an eight-week period is a rarity.' </p>

<p>Avaline White and Rosé have also received recognition from top reviewers such as Anthony Dias Blue of The Tasting Panel who rated the wines 91 and 90 respectively.</p>

<p>'We believe in bringing cleaner options to our shelves so Avaline is a perfect fit,' says Kevin McCarthy, Category Manager: Adult Beverage at Fresh Thyme Market.</p>

<p>Plugging her stuff: The siren is seen here talking up her rose earlier this summer</p>

<p>'We displayed it prominently in our stores throughout the summer, selling almost 2,000 units since it went chainwide. By attracting a balanced consumer, Avaline has the potential to disrupt the market with its clean, simple label.'</p>

<p>Diaz has given us some memorable roles over the years with films like The Mask and The Sweetest Thing.</p>

<p>But the four-time Golden Globe nominee and new mom has taken a break from acting getting married - The Bad Teacher star has since welcomed her first child, a daughter named Raddix, in December with husband Benji Madden, whom she married in 2015.</p>

<p>Back on TV: Also this week she was part of the Charlie's Angels reunion for Drew Barrymore's show</p>

<p>Socially distanced: On set was Drew, left, Lucy Liu, middle, and Cameron, right</p>

<p>While she might be ready to grace the big screen once again in the near future, Diaz is being very particular about how she makes her return to acting.</p>

<p>The star 'is enjoying her time away from the action, and spending it with her husband and baby Raddix,' a source told ET .</p>

<p>The insider added: 'Cameron worked consistently for almost 20 years and needed a break.</p>

<p>'Cameron loves being a mother and that is her main focus now. Cameron plans to be selective in any projects she considers for the future, but for now it’s all about family.'</p>

<p>She last starred alongside Jamie Foxx and Rose Byrne in the 2014 feature adaptation of Annie.</p>
