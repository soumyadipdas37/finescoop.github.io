<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gary Neville has fumed after Crystal Palace were awarded a penalty for handball, which was then re-taken after David De Gea was seen to be off his line.</p>

<p>The incident happened in the second-half as Crystal Palace were 1-0 up as Jordan Ayew kicked the ball off the arm of Victor Lindelof.</p>

<p>The incident was investigated by VAR who decided to award the penalty.</p>

<p>Referee Martin Atkinson gave a penalty for a handball on Victor Lindelof after a VAR review</p>

<p>Gary Neville criticed the decision saying the defender could not have done anything </p>

<p>Jordan Ayew's tame penalty was saved but David De Gea was deemed to have been off his line</p>

<p>Former United player Gary Neville was amazed at the decision to investigate the a possible handball and to award the penalty.</p>

<p>He said:  'Ayew scoops it up against Lindelof's arm - I'll be absolutely amazed, I'd be devastated if I had a penalty given against me for that.</p>

<p>'His arm's moved with his running action. I thought that Leeds one last week at Anfield was nonsense and I think this one is equally so. </p>

<p>'Absolutely no chance is that a penalty, never in a million years. Not a chance he's not got a clue that has happened so quick running back defending one-on-one. In the swing of the game Crystal Palace deserve to be 2-0 but the way it's happening is the problem. Roy Hodgson would think it's nonsense at all.'</p>

<p>Jordan Ayew stepped up to take the penalty but his weak shot was comfortably saved by De Gea.</p>

<p>Though half a minute after the penalty was missed, the referee stopped play to re-award the penalty after De Gea was inches off his line.  </p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha stepped up on the second effort and converted to then put Palace 2-0 in front</p>

<p>Gary Neville called the penalty decision 'nonsense' and the decision to retake it a 'disgrace'</p>

<p>Neville said: 'That's an absolute disgrace he was what two inches off the line. We're talking millimetres that is unbelievable. I understand if they gain a yard or two yards.'</p>

<p>'Crystal Palace have been far better and Manchester United have been nowhere near their sharpness. But their has been a element of good luck, the penalty was not a penalty and the re-take was nonsense, but Man United have been well short.</p>

<p>Wilfried Zaha stepped up instead of Ayew and smashed the ball home to make it 2-0.</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek got his first goal for the club to make it 2-1 before Zaha added a third.</p>
