<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manager David Moyes admitted West Ham were 'miles off' in the opening day defeat by Newcastle on Saturday night. </p>

<p>The Hammers clipped the crossbar twice in the first half through Angelo Ogbonna and Pablo Fornals.</p>

<p>But it was Newcastle who made the breakthrough just before the hour when Callum Wilson tucked in Jeff Hendrick's flick-on.</p>

<p>A difficult week ended in a disappointing defeat for West Ham boss David Moyes </p>

<p>Hendrick wrapped up a deserved 2-0 victory three minutes from the end when he found the top corner from 15 yards.</p>

<p>Afterwards Moyes said: 'Didn't enjoy the performance didn't enjoy the game. So that's my thoughts. We didn't show enough quality. </p>

<p>'It was a disappointing game and I didn't particularly think it was officiated well today but that's not the reason we lost.</p>

<p>Callum Wilson poked Newcastle ahead earlier in the second half from close range</p>

<p>'Miles off (last season). I’ll try and find out why and I’ll try and do better with it. I thought we’d have started off the same way and with the same form that we were in at the end of last season but we didn’t. Partly Newcastle made it difficult for us but I’d have liked us to do a lot better today.'</p>

<p>Moyes felt Wilson's goal could have been disallowed for a high foot.</p>

<p>'I thought it was dangerous play,' he said. 'The game didn't feel like it was officiated particularly well, but that's not why we lost.</p>

<p>'I hadn't see that coming at all, even from when I took over in December. I expected much better.'</p>

<p>Hendrick's strike three minutes from time cemented a deserved three points for the Toon</p>

<p>The Hammers were in a mild state of disarray even before a ball was kicked this season, having angered fans and players - notably captain Mark Noble - with the controversial sale of Grady Diangana to West Brom.</p>

<p>That, and the lack of incoming transfers, has seen the club's board come under fire again and, even though supporters are still not allowed in, a handful gathered outside the stadium to protest.</p>

<p>However, Moyes insisted the off-field unrest had no bearing on the performance.</p>

<p>'When you go over the line it's down to your own concentration,' he added. 'The dressing room has been very good with a good spirit among the players.'</p>
