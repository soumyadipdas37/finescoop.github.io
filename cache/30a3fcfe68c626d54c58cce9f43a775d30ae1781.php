<p>Hard at work! Work is officially underway on Mark Wright and Michelle Keegan's dream home and on Wednesday, the former TOWIE star sported high-vis as he was spotted on the building site of his new house</p>

<p>Mark looked engrossed in his work as he chatted to his dad and a fellow construction expert who they warmly greeted on site. </p>

<p>Back in June it was revealed that the sprawling new home will feature a huge swimming pool, bar and make-up room, floor plans have revealed. </p>

<p>Posted on Epping Council website and being designed by Essex-based company MP Architects, the stunning plans show the couple's incredible vision, which also features a playroom for any future kids. </p>

<p>Wow! The new home will feature a huge swimming pool, bar and make-up room, floor plans revealed</p>

<p>Happy days: The couple have been married for five years (pictured in March last year)</p>

<p>Big ideas: Their planning agent previously said: 'This new house has been carefully designed so that it is similar in area and volume to what is currently on the site</p>

<p>While the couple had no objections from neighbours, they withdrew requests for 'demolition of an existing stable building' to build a 'one-bedroom annexe'.</p>

<p>Images of the ground floor show the home is set to give a nod to both their love of work and play, with a gym and bar placed either side of the huge kitchen.</p>

<p>The hub of the home is certainly the kitchen, which runs the entire length of the back of the house and includes a living area and island. </p>

<p>Lobbying: While the couple had no objections from neighbours, they withdrew requests for 'demolition of an existing stable building' to build a 'one-bedroom annexe'</p>

<p>Every bedroom features an en suite while cupboards are littered through the floor. The first floor features three bedrooms.</p>

<p>Second floor plans show two more bedrooms and further en suites.</p>

<p>Set on sprawling grounds, the rear of the house boasts a swimming pool plan while the vast drive is set to accommodate a plethora of cars.  </p>

<p>Sprawling: The views visible from their future home were nothing short of exquisite </p>

<p>Their planning agent previously said: 'This new house has been carefully designed so that it is similar in area and volume to what is currently on the site.</p>

<p>'The new house will sit further back on the site and will create a much more functional family dwelling for our clients.</p>

<p>'The existing house has been extended several times and is not functional, therefore a new house would be a better use of the site.'</p>

<p>That was then: On starting a family after moving into their dream home, Mark previously said: 'We say we're going to try [for a baby] every year but something comes up with work'</p>

<p>'So it'll be Michelle filming in South Africa and then I got the job in Los Angeles – so we think, right, we'll try next year. It'll be around December or January, we'll talk about it and we'll go from there.</p>

<p>'With kids, I used to want three or four. But now, I'm 31, we're not having kids any time before 32. I think we could have two or three. Twins would be great because you're getting two out of the way at once!</p>
