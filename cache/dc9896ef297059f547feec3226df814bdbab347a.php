<p>Shutting it down: The IMG model fired back at baseless body shamers this month who have been openly trolling the weight she has gained since giving birth to her two daughters with Robin Thicke</p>

<p>'Because before having babies, I didn't have this fat a** and I am forever grateful for this baby weight,' she said. </p>

<p>Although she did not provide specific examples of the body shaming she has been receiving online, Geary made clear with her tone that the frequency of such comments is high.</p>

<p>April became a mom first time in 2018, four-years after she began dating Thicke.</p>

<p>Robin proposed to April in December of 2018, while she was pregnant with their second child, daughter Lola. </p>
