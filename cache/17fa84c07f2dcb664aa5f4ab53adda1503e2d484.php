<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two-time major winner John Daly - who used to smoke 40 cigarettes a day and drank 28 Diet Cokes - has been diagnosed with bladder cancer.</p>

<p>Though Daly underwent successful surgery, he says there is 'an 85 per cent chance it comes back', leaving him hoping for a 'miracle'.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old American, who won the 1991 PGA Championship and the 1995 Open at St Andrews, is well known for puffing away on a cigarette out on the course. </p>

<p>American golfer John Daly, 54,  who formerly smokes 40 cigarettes a day as well as drinking 28 Diet Cokes, has been diagnosed with bladder cancer</p>

<p>Daly was diagnosed with the cancer during an appointment to look for kidney stones</p>

<p>But having received the cancer diagnosis after visiting the doctor for kidney stones and back pain, Daly, who has battled other issues such as alcoholism, plans to reform his health.</p>

<p>'I'm cutting way, way back on the Diet Coke and counting minutes before I can have a cigarette. I'm trying to quit smoking,' Daly told Golf Channel.</p>

<p>'The doctors aren't saying it's too late. Unfortunately, it's a cancer that keeps coming back.</p>

<p>'But I'm going to listen to them, and I'm going to try and quit smoking. If it comes back, it comes back.</p>

<p>'Six months to a year, if it doesn't go away, I'm going to live my life. I'm gonna have some fun.' </p>

<p>Daly won two majors during his career - including The Open at St Andrews in 1995 (pictured)</p>

<p>Daly said that he's 'not scared to die or anything' and insists he wants to continue playing for as long as he is able.</p>

<p>'It would have been nice to play the last seven or eight or 13 years of my career a little more healthy,' he admitted.</p>

<p>'But hey, I'm still working, I'm still living life, I'm still doing the things I need to.</p>

<p>'I can accept the challenge. I'm not scared of that. I just want my kids to be OK and everyone else in my family.'</p>

<p>Daly insists he intends to continue living his life to the full despite the cancer diagnosis</p>

<p>On his diagnosis, Daly added: '[The doctor said] it doesn't look like any stones are in there. But, unfortunately, you have bladder cancer.</p>

<p>'After I did the CT I was fixing to sip on my Diet Coke I got from McDonald's and he said, 'Don't drink anything. We have to get you back in here and get this cancer out of you.'</p>

<p>'Luckily for me they caught it early, but bladder cancer is something that I don't know all the details.</p>

<p>'But it doesn't look like it may go away. We will just see what happens. Maybe there's a miracle.'</p>
