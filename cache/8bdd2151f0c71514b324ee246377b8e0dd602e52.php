<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Matt Lucas has revealed that he's 'put on a lot of weight' after trying the delicious treats made by contestants on the Great British Bake Off.</p>

<p>The comedian, 46, joined the show this year as a host and replacement for Sandi Toksvig and is set to make his debut on TV screens on September 22.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of the show returning, Matt has said he was very nervous going into filming and only got two hours sleep ahead of his first day, reports The Mirror. </p>

<p>Oh dear! Matt Lucas has revealed he's 'put on a lot of weight' after trying the delicious treats made by contestants during his debut series as a host on the Great British Bake Off</p>

<p>Despite being worried to start with, the Little Britain star soon got into the swing of things and credited his co-stars with helping him settle in.</p>

<p>He said: 'I had the best six weeks, it was scary being the new kid, but Noel, Prue [Leith] and Paul [Hollywood] were so welcoming kinds and happy to play.'</p>

<p>Matt also told Waitrose Magazine that when filming started he tried a bit of each of the 12 bakers' goods, but then had to go a few days without tasting anything.</p>

<p>However he said: 'In the last four or five episodes, I started trying things again. I did put on a lot of weight. In the last couple of episodes I can't fit on the screen!' </p>

<p>New challenge: The comedian also said he was so nervous ahead of filming the first episode that he only got two hours sleep, adding that it was 'scary being the new kid'</p>

<p>Speaking about his nerves ahead of the show, Matt said it was a different kind of job for him as he's usually given a script with lines to learn.</p>

<p>However on Bake Off he just had to be himself, something which he wasn't used to doing when the cameras were rolling.</p>

<p>He said: 'Some bakers are really chatty and others... sometimes you talk to them and they are really focused on the bake. You think Oh God! I'm irritating. I wasn't sure if it would be something I would be good at'.</p>

<p>It comes after the full line-up of bakers competing in the eleventh season of The Great British Bake Off was revealed.</p>

<p>Having fun: Despite his initial concerns, Matt said he was soon laughing with his supportive co-host Noel Fielding</p>

<p>The new batch of hopefuls are as diverse as ever and include a pantomime producer, a radiographer, an armoured guard, and an amputee who uses baking as a form of therapy.</p>

<p>This year's edition will see Matt make his debut as he replaces Sandi to host alongside comedian Noel Fielding and judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith.</p>

<p>The upcoming series took place at a private location in Essex after five years of filming at Welford Park in Berkshire.</p>

<p>Let's bake! Channel 4 recently unveiled the 12 home-bakers competing in the eleventh season of The Great British Bake Off,  due to hit screens next Tuesday (L-R: Hermine, Sura, Rowan, Marc, Laura, Linda, Makbul, Dave, Loriea, Lottie, Mark and Peter)</p>

<p>All the cast and crew members had to undergo regular COVID-19 testing in an isolation bubble amid the pandemic. </p>

<p>Producers said they drew up a list of safety rules 'longer than the Bible' before filming started in Essex. Executive producer Letty Kavanagh insisted even packets of flour were cleaned several times.</p>

<p>And Before entering the 'biosphere', the contestants had to quarantine for nine days and then give two negative results from coronavirus tests. </p>

<p>They were tested again at the venue. Anything coming in and out of the Bake Off bubble, including luggage and food deliveries, had to be deep-cleaned.  </p>

<p>Fantastic four: This year's edition will see Matt make his debut as he replaces Sandi Toksvig to host alongside comedian Noel Fielding and judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith</p>
