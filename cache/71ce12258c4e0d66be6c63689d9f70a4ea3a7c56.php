<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 15-minute COVID-19 diagnosis which could be quicker than a pregnancy test could be on the market before year's end, according to the company developing it in  Queensland.</p>

<p>Biotechnology firm Xing Technologies is working on the test, called XavTrap, after being allocated $1.5 million in Queensland government and a further $1 million by the US Food and Drug Administration to develop its research.</p>

<p>Researcher Dr Yadveer Grewal explained how the test works; a nasal swab is applied to cheap and simple baker's yeast is coated with hook-like particles to trap the virus just like velcro.</p>

<p>That yeast is then combined with strip technology used in pregnancy tests to rapidly determine whether a person has the virus, without the need to send the sample away for analysis.</p>

<p>'That way someone could have a nasal swab taken, apply it to a strip and within five to 15 minutes, depending on how infectious they are, get a result then and there,' he told Nine's Today program.</p>

<p>Currently, there's a risk high-quality nasal swab lab tests can produce double negatives.</p>

<p>But Dr Yadveer said his test, called XavTrap, could still be effective even though it was less sensitive.</p>

<p>The United States FDA, which is also backing the project with $US1 million, believes the sensitivity and price of tests can be lowered if people using them get tested more frequently, he added.</p>

<p>The technology could be applied in circumstances where rapid diagnosis was required. </p>

<p>Dr Yadveer used the example of doctors and nurses using Xing's test every time they started a hospital shift, and it could be used for people checking in for flights and getting a result before they board.</p>

<p>Pictured: A medical worker administering a test for coronavirus in Sydney in August. Current tests takes days to destemine whether a patient is infected</p>

<p>'Testing yourself every couple of days is about equivalent to having a once-off high-quality specific test from a lab,' he said.</p>

<p>Another difference between XavTrap and other tests is that it discriminates between live and dead viruses, so it's less likely to result in false-positives.</p>

<p>Xing Technologies is hoping to have its new COVID-19 test on the market by the end of 2020 and also eventually hopes to use XavTrap to test for other infectious viruses like dengue fever, and even cancer</p>

<p>'Ideally then, we are able to manufacture immediately by the end of the year and distribute it,' Dr Yadveer said.</p>

<p>'Because of our technology is easily programmable we have other lead candidates we are exploring, and they can come online early next year.'</p>
