<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A transgender thug who identifies as a woman has been jailed in an all-male prison for 20 weeks following a racist rampage inside a Sainsbury's. </p>

<p>Rachelle Mikhnevich, 36, kicked and attempted to bite two police officers after shouting racial slurs at store employees when she struggled to scan items at a self-service checkout in Manchester.</p>

<p>Mikhnevich assaulted an assistant and kicked the store manager in the attack, before telling a security guard: 'Go away you f***ing n****r, go away.</p>

<p>'F<strong><em>ing look the other way lad before I f</em></strong>ing knock these c<strong>ts out, f</strong>k off you ugly c**t.'</p>

<p>Following the incident, which took place at a supermarket inside Manchester Piccadilly station on March 16, Mikhnevich claimed she had drunk three bottles of wine before the attack.</p>

<p>Rachelle Mikhnevich, 36, kicked and attempted to bite two police officers after shouting racial slurs at store employees when she struggled to scan items at a self-service checkout in Manchester</p>

<p>She insisted 'I'm not a racist' when speaking to police, while apologising and claiming: 'It's not how I usually behave.'</p>

<p>'I am shocked by what I have done and I am disgusted with myself and I can only apologise,' she said. </p>

<p>Mikhnevich, from Helsby near Frodsham, Cheshire, was jailed for 20 weeks at Manchester Magistrates' Court after she was convicted of assault and racially aggravated public disorder.  </p>

<p>She is now being detained at the men-only Altcourse Jail in Liverpool, where she is undergoing hormone therapy while awaiting surgery for the next stage of her five-year gender reassignment transition.</p>

<p>Prosecuting, Eileen Rodgers explained how Mikhnevich was at the self-service till at around 9.15am when an employee approached her to ask if she 'needed any help as he could see she was struggling.'</p>

<p>Miss Rodgers told the court: 'She said the items had already been purchased but couldn't prove that to the shop employee. </p>

<p>Following the incident, which took place at a supermarket inside Manchester Piccadilly station on March 16, Mikhnevich claimed she had drunk three bottles of wine before the attack</p>

<p>'He then challenged her and she became abusive and kicked him in the legs.</p>

<p>'The store manager ... then became involved when he saw what was going on and went over to try to calm the situation but he was kicked between the legs and looked to be in a lot of pain. </p>

<p>'They couldn't stop [her] from kicking and shouting 'f*** off' again and again and had to hold on to her for five minutes before the police arrived.'</p>

<p>Miss Rodgers explained how a security guard then came over to diffuse the situation, but Mikhnevich began shouting racial slurs at him.</p>

<p>'He was also kicked as well,' she said. 'Police were called to attend but during the arrest, she was very abusive and was very drunk and on numerous occasions attempted to bite these officers and decided to try and spit at them.  </p>

<p>'She later admitted in interview to being extremely drunk ... and had consumed at least three bottles of wine. </p>

<p>'She made numerous apologies confirming she has no proper recollection due to memory loss and the alcohol she had taken in. </p>

<p>'She was completely remorseful and apologised and said she should not have done that and she's not a racist by nature. She doesn't believe in anything like that at all.'</p>

<p>The victims suffered no lasting injuries as a result of the attack. </p>

<p>In evidence, security guard Amate Ayittey said: 'I heard one of the staff saying they want to check the receipt of the customer but the customer was trying to throw all the items from his bag and kicked off. </p>

<p>'Sid [Keita, the store employee] is from Nigeria and the customer used the N word. We were doing our duty and I was just trying to protect the staff. I felt bad that Sid had been called that name.</p>

<p>Mikhnevich (pictured) had 17 offences on her record including previous assaults on emergency workers, sending threatening letters and having a bladed article</p>

<p>She is now being detained at Altcourse Jail in Liverpool, where she is undergoing hormone therapy while awaiting surgery for the next stage of her gender reassignment transition</p>

<p>'The store was busy and there were people around who where shocked.'</p>

<p>Mikhnevich had 17 offences on her record including previous assaults on emergency workers, sending threatening letters and having a bladed article.</p>

<p>In mitigation, defence lawyer Steven Alis said: 'By her nature, she's not a racist person but she accepts she was very intoxicated. </p>

<p>'She was very upset on the day and struggled and kicked out but fortunately for her none of the staff or police officers suffered any serious injuries apart from some discomfort on the actual day. </p>

<p>'She takes on a daily basis 17 tablets to cope with various ailments some on which are hormone tablets. She has a lot of personal issues going on in her life.</p>

<p>'The transgender journey is a five-year journey and she started on taking hormones over the past 18 months. </p>

<p>'She is currently awaiting an appointment for the next stage but according to her, it'll be about another three years before the whole process assuming it goes smoothly is completed. She's not someone who has just begun this journey it's been a long time.</p>

<p>'She said she realised at a very young age she was in the wrong body and her journey has taken a long time to start and she has been abused on the way. </p>

<p>'She is a miss but inside a male prison as she's currently pending an operation.'</p>
