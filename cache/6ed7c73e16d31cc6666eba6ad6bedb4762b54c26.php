<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prospective new Arsenal signing Runar Alex Runarsson may have some explaining to do after tweets surfaced in which he branded Arsene Wenger a 'French f***'.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old Iceland international goalkeeper, who plays for French club Dijon, is attracting interest from the Gunners as they search for a replacement for Aston Villa-bound Emiliano Martinez.</p>

<p>Dijon have set a price tag of just £1.5million for Runarsson, who was an unused substitute when Iceland lost to England in the UEFA Nations League earlier this month.</p>

<p>Old tweets have emerged in which Arsenal transfer target Runar Alex Runarsson brands their former manager Arsene Wenger a 'French f***'</p>

<p>Iceland international Runarsson, then 16, was certainly angry with Wenger and Arsenal</p>

<p>But eagle-eyed Arsenal fans have dug up tweets Runarsson posted nine years ago as a 16-year-old - since deleted - in which he strongly criticises former Arsenal boss Wenger.</p>

<p>The first tweet, from April 21 that year and originally written in Icelandic, says: 'Hell, this Wenger guy is stupid.'</p>

<p>That comes the day after a north London derby at Tottenham in which Arsenal led 3-1 only to end up drawing 3-3. </p>

<p>Another, posted on June 15, 2011, reads: 'Arsene Wenger is a little too stupid #frenchf***.' </p>

<p>A third post, from August 21 that year, reads: 'Arsene Wenger is definitely the dumbest man on this planet #frenchf***.'</p>

<p>It isn't clear what annoyed the teenage Runarsson in the June post but by the time of his August follow up, Arsenal had sold Cesc Fabregas to Barcelona.</p>

<p>Runarsson posted at least three tweets criticising Wenger, with the first coming in April 2011</p>

<p>Wenger was once again the subject of Runarsson's anger after an August defeat to Liverpool</p>

<p>They'd also lost 2-0 at home to Arsenal in their second Premier League match of the season, with both goals coming after Emmanuel Frimpong was shown a second yellow card.</p>

<p>Things would go from bad to worse for the Gunners later that week, with Samir Nasri sold to Manchester City and the team demolished 8-2 by Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>Runarsson ensured the old tweets were deleted as soon as Arsenal fans brought them to light but that didn't stop some suggesting he shouldn't be signed.</p>

<p>Arsenal have also considered Brentford keeper David Raya, valued at £10million, as Mikel Arteta looks to bring in a back-up to No 1 Bernd Leno.</p>

<p>Runarsson has been lined up as a potential replacement for Aston Villa-bound Martinez</p>

<p>The Gunners are looking for a new understudy for their No 1 goalkeeper Bernd Leno </p>

<p>Leno kept a clean sheet as Arsenal secured a comfortable 3-0 victory over Fulham on the opening day of the new Premier League season at the weekend.</p>

<p>Martinez, who starred in the Gunners' recent FA Cup and Community Shield triumphs, was not included in Saturday's squad as he edges closer to a switch to Villa.</p>

<p>Arsenal are on the brink of reaching a £20m agreement to see Martinez make the move to Villa Park to be their first-choice stopper.</p>

<p>The Gunners need to bring in a new face before the transfer window closes on October 5.</p>
