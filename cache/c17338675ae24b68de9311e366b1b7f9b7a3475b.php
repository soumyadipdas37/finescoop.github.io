<p>'Words alone will never be enough to convey our heartfelt thanks to everybody who has donated to the Givealittle page or delivered food and flowers to us,' she told Stuff.</p>

<p>'The whole Upper Hutt community is grieving the loss of our baby right here with us and it's clear to see that Amberlie has brought our already strong community closer together. She has really touched the lives of so many.' </p>

<p>The family, who moved from the UK to New Zealand in 2011, feared they wouldn't be able to afford to fly their relatives over amid coronavirus travel restrictions.</p>

<p>But a Give A Little fundraising page started by two of Ms Pennington-Foley's close friends has already amassed $35,000 in donations.</p>

<p>The money will go towards travel for Ms Pennington-Foley and her husband's parents, as well as hotel quarantine and 'holding a celebration of Amberlie's short but happy life'.</p>

<p>'Any excess funds will be used by Emma and Rob to ease the financial burden on the family,' the page read.</p>

<p>Ms Pennington-Foley said she is overwhelmed by the support her family has received.</p>
