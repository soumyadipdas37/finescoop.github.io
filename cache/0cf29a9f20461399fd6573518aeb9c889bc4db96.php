<p>Coleen also confessed her fear of dying on the operating table has left her battling to make up her mind as to whether to go under the knife for elective surgery. </p>

<p>Huge decision: Coleen Nolan has revealed she's struggling to decide whether to have a double mastectomy following her sisters Anne and Linda's cancer diagnosis earlier this year</p>

<p>The star was devastated after older sister Anne, 69, was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer earlier this year, with Linda, 61, finding out she has incurable liver cancer just few days later. </p>

<p>The heartbreaking news came seven years after they lost their sister Bernie to the disease.</p>

<p>Last month Coleen said she's thought about having the procedure to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer in the future. </p>

<p>And a month later, the singer is still in two minds as she opened up to OK! magazine about her next step.</p>

<p>Honest: In a candid new interview, the Loose Women star, 55, admitted that her breasts are like 'two time bombs sitting there' as she discussed the likely hood of getting breast cancer like her siblings (Pictured Linda and Anne earlier this year)</p>

<p>She told the publication:  'When I first heard about Linda and Anne back in April, my knee-jerk reaction was, get these breasts off me! It’s like having two timebombs sitting there. Since then I’ve calmed down, but I still lie awake at night worrying. </p>

<p>'I’m in limbo and really struggling to decide. It’s horrendous enough when you’ve got no choice in the matter, but when it’s a voluntary decision to lose your breasts it’s so difficult.'</p>

<p>Coleen went on to say that the odds of her developing breast cancer are 'high', adding it doesn't 'look good' for her.</p>

<p>But despite the gloomy odds, Coleen admitted that there are several factors stopping her from making the momentous decision straight away, including the fear of losing her life.</p>

<p>Taking action? 'When I first heard about Linda and Anne back in April, my knee-jerk reaction was, get these breasts off me! It’s like having two timebombs sitting there'</p>

<p>She continued: 'My breasts are absolutely not worth dying for so I’ve no problem with getting rid of them. It’s the operation, the long recovery and the potential pain that I’m scared of. What if I die during the anaesthetic? What if I have my boobs removed and then I get cancer in another part of my body?'</p>

<p>Another factor in her decision is the thought of her leaving her children Shane Jr, 31, Jake, 28, and Ciara, 19, behind if she dies, adding: 'They’re not ready to lose me.' </p>

<p>Despite calling her breasts 'ticking time bombs', Coleen has told she is not giving herself a deadline to make her choice and will instead focus on doing research.</p>

<p>Tough: 'I’m in limbo and really struggling to decide. It’s horrendous enough when you’ve got no choice in the matter, but when it’s a voluntary decision to lose your breasts it’s so difficult'</p>

<p>With that said, the TV personality also remarked that she's 'frightened' that she'll develop breast cancer before she makes up her mind about her mastectomy. </p>

<p>However, on a more positive note, she also reflected on her 'love hate' relationship with her breasts, adding that reconstruction could be the opportunity to get the breast 'I’ve always wanted'. </p>

<p>Last month, Coleen further discussed her fear of developing the disease, telling The Mirror: 'The guilt is incredible, I don’t feel guilty for not having the disease; I feel guilty for being afraid of it when I think of Anne and Linda living with it. But of course it’s hard not to be consumed by fear when those so close to you have been affected.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the singer told how she was so shocked by her sisters' tragic news that she couldn't 'couldn’t even cry'.</p>

<p>Battle: Older sister Anne, 69, was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer earlier this year, with Linda, 61, finding out she has incurable liver cancer just few days later</p>

<p>She went on to describe the 'incredible anger' that she felt and said how she though to herself that cancer could 'f**** off'.</p>

<p>The TV personality added that she felt 'totally helpless' after learning the news as the coronavirus lockdown meant that they were kept apart. </p>

<p>Amid the devastation in their family, Coleen also told how her children were 'absolutely terrified' that she'd develop the illness too.</p>

<p>Anne found out she has stage three breast cancer shortly after the pair returned from filming a series of The Nolans Go Cruising with sisters Coleen and Maureen in March. </p>

<p>Tough: 'I feel guilty for being afraid of it when I think of Anne and Linda living with it. But of course it’s hard not to be consumed by fear when those so close to you have been affected'</p>

<p>She discovered the lump leading to her diagnosis in April, exactly 20 years after she was first found to have the disease in 2000. </p>

<p>Her sister Linda, 61, found out she has incurable liver cancer days later. </p>

<p>The pop star has also battled cancer before, after being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006, cellulitis and lymphoedema in her arm in 2007 and secondary cancer on her pelvis in 2017. </p>

<p>After the sisters received their devastating diagnoses, Maureen moved in with Anne and Linda relocated to her sister Denise's home. </p>

<p>Upsetting: The devastating news comes seven years after Linda and Anne lost their sister Bernie (pictured second from right in 2012) to cancer in 2013</p>
