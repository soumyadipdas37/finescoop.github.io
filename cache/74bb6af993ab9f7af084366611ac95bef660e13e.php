<p>She added that her youthful appearance helps her professionally because she can be cast as younger characters. </p>

<p>She said: 'I don’t think it’s hindered my acting career at all in fact, in many ways it gives me the advantage of having the looks to play a younger character, but the maturity And experience that comes in handy to play more challenging roles, and my agents are able to cast me in roles ranging anywhere from 20-30.' </p>
