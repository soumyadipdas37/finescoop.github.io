<p>The season 12 finale entitled 'Viva la Dysfunction,' ended with Dorinda, 55, peacefully enjoying a Christmastime 'Drag Queen Bingo' event thrown by Sonja Morgan, 56.</p>

<p>In a sweet moment, Leah McSweeney, 37, thanked the cast for opening their hearts to her, and recalled how Tinsley had initially introduced her to them.</p>

<p>Final appearance: Dorinda Medley flipped out and called Tinsley Mortimer a 'b****' one last time as she ended her run on RHONY on Thursday's season finale</p>

<p>At the mention of her former frenemy's name, Dorinda suddenly freaked out on Leah.</p>

<p>'No! I'm not doing that s<strong><em>!' she spat, walking away. 'Sorry! F</em></strong> you.'</p>

<p>'Are you f<strong><em>ing kidding me?' Leah cried, as Dorinda replied, 'I will not give Tinsley that. F</em></strong> you. I won't. Tinsley did s***. Tinsley almost ruined our show.'</p>

<p>Tinsley, who'd starred on four seasons of RHONY, left in the middle of season 12 to move to Chicago in order to be with her fiancé Scott Kluth, 41.</p>

<p>Flipped out: The 55-year-old reality star flipped out when Leah McSweeney, 37, thanked the cast for opening their hearts to her, and recalled how Tinsley had initially introduced her to them</p>

<p>In August, Dorinda announced her departure from the series after six seasons, with some press reports speculating that either her anger issues or drinking had become a problem for the show. </p>

<p>Ramona Singer, 63, told Leah that Dorinda had clearly had too much to drink.</p>

<p>Dorinda then stomped back over to Leah and waggled her finger in her face.</p>

<p>Too much: 'Are you f<strong><em>ing kidding me?' Leah cried, as Dorinda replied, 'I will not give Tinsley that. F</em></strong> you. I won't. Tinsley did s***. Tinsley almost ruined our show'</p>

<p>'You're gonna give a toast to Tinsley Mortimer, who left the show and breached her contract, and left over nothing?' Dorinda asked her.</p>

<p>'Exactly! I agree!' Sonja shouted. 'If you're not here, you don't get kudos.'</p>

<p>'You don't mention her name,' Dorinda informed Leah, who retorted, 'I will say whatever I want, actually.'</p>

<p>Forbidden name: 'I will say whatever I want, actually,' Leah said after Dorinda told her not to mention Tinsley's name</p>

<p>'I am a principled person,' Dorinda continued, gesturing at Leah and a nearby Luann de Lesseps, 55, with her hand, which had just undergone surgery.</p>

<p>'That hand is working pretty well over there,' Luann cracked, as Dorinda said, 'No it's not! It's sore. You should be more appreciative of it.'</p>

<p>'You're spitting all over!' Ramona yelled at Dorinda, who repeated that Tinsley had 'breached the contract' and 'fled' the show.</p>

<p>Hurt hand: Dorinda despite a sore hand waggled her fingers at people</p>

<p>Spittle flying: Ramona Singer protested that Dorinda was spitting all over them in her fury</p>

<p>Sonja muttered that she'd invited Tinsley to the bingo event, but she hadn't shown.</p>

<p>'Try principle,' Dorinda rambled on, as Ramona made the universal sign for crazy around her ear. 'F*** that s***.'</p>

<p>'She's obsessed with Tinsley,' Leah marveled to Luann, who was sitting next to her. 'All I was saying was that Tinsley left and it gave me a chance to bond with everybody, and I love all of you. That was what I was literally trying to tell her ...I love her!'</p>

<p>Crazy sign: Dorrinda rambled on about Tinsley as Ramona made the universal crazy sign</p>

<p>'And you're still here,' Luann pointed out.</p>

<p>In the distance, Dorinda could be heard venting to Sonja about Tinsley, saying, 'She left us. And she's a b****.'</p>

<p>Luann was horrified, telling Leah, 'She's going beyond, and now this is beyond my wildest expectations of her as a person. I'm really freaked out.'</p>

<p>Harsh words: In the distance, Dorinda could be heard venting to Sonja about Tinsley, saying, 'She left us. And she's a b****'</p>

<p>'I don't want that b****'s name mentioned,' Dorinda continued.</p>

<p>'She's got work to do,' Luann said of Dorinda. 'We've all got work to do. When you don't grow, that's a great example over there.'</p>

<p>'I'm done,' Leah insisted, to which Luann countered, 'I'm not. I know it's done. There's a lot of pain and a lot of s*** going on in there.'</p>

<p>Work needed: 'She's got work to do,' Luann said of Dorinda. 'We've all got work to do. When you don't grow, that's a great example over there'</p>

<p>The two of them decided they no longer wanted to deal with Dorinda that night, as Lu joked, 'Happy F***ing Holidays.'</p>

<p>In a preview of next week's RHONY reunion show, guest star Tinsley told Dorinda she needed to take accountability for her actions on RHONY, calling her apology 'way too little too late.'</p>

<p>The show opened on a brighter note, with cabaret star Luann recording a song called 'Viva La Diva,' written by legendary songwriters Carole Bayer Sager and Jay Landers, and produced by Desmond Child.</p>

<p>All of them had worked on Barbra Streisand's last record, and as Desmond helped Luann get into the right voice for her recording, he hoped that they had a hit.</p>

<p>Dorinda, meanwhile, was recovering from surgery to remove a 'Bible bump,' or Ganglion cyst, from her hand, a growth she described as being like an octopus, with tentacles.</p>

<p>The surgery was just the latest challenge she'd faced this season, after grappling with a devastating flood at her vacation home and gutting her Manhattan apartment.</p>

<p>Still, she seemed cheery and hopeful about her future, saying in a confessional, 'I had to go through some murky water, but I feel like now the waters are calming.'</p>

<p>She predicted 2020 would be a good year for her, adding, 'I deserve it. I'm a good person, Dorinda Medley, and I've fought hard to get here, and you know what? I feel good about it.'</p>

<p>As she walked around her apartment, still under renovation, she picked up an object from the floor, hoping it was a coin because her late husband Richard once left her those for luck.</p>

<p>It was just a bit of metal, and Dorinda wondered if it meant that she was going broke.</p>

<p>At her Upper East Side townhouse, Sonja was also in the midst of an update, revamping the interiors because she was trying to sell it.</p>

<p>She invited Ramona to come by and check it out, and Ramona posed sexily on the carpet.</p>

<p>Leah got in a holiday mood by decorating gingerbread houses with her mother Bunny and daughter Kier, 12.</p>

<p>She and Bunny had been working on their relationship lately, and seemed to have reached a fragile peace, which pleased Leah.</p>

<p>She and her sister Sarah then attended a preview of Luann's new cabaret piece, Marry F*** Kill, in which Sonja was also starring.</p>

<p>The show focused on sex and relationships, and saw Luann joking about how she was going to try 'not to get married, divorced or arrested' over New Year's for once.</p>

<p>Sonja secretly felt that Lu's material was getting old, but played along when asked who she'd 'Marry, F***, or Kill': Ramona, Dorinda or Tinsley.</p>

<p>'I'm gonna kill Ramona,' Sonja returned. 'Tinsley's un-f***able.' Maybe I'll marry her after her first divorce… uh, second divorce… and then that leaves me having sex with Dorinda, who may be a sleeper hit in the bed. People pleaser!'</p>

<p>Good times: The show newcomer and her sister Sarah attended a preview of Luann's new cabaret piece, Marry F*** Kill, in which Sonja was also starring</p>

<p>At the event's after-party, Sonja revealed that she'd been feeling like she let herself go recently, and asked Leah to take her to work out, which Leah promised to do.</p>

<p>Later that week, Sonja held her Drag Queen Bingo party, which she'd thrown to raise money for GLAAD and to support the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

<p>Dorinda showed up in a glittery silver outfit with a turban on her head, and joked, 'I think one of these drag queens went into my closet. I have half these clothes.'</p>

<p>Leah sported her 'eighth-grade Christmas dress, from 1995,' which had been created by Sex And The City designer Patricia Field.</p>

<p>Ramona rolled in with her platonic friend Ron on her arm, irritating Sonja who couldn't believe she'd brought a straight guy, and privately said, 'Read the room, b****.'</p>

<p>Sonja, however, was delighted to learn that she'd made out with him at a bar six years before.</p>

<p>Platonic friend: Ramona rolled in with her platonic friend Ron on her arm, irritating Sonja who couldn't believe she'd brought a straight guy, and privately said, 'Read the room, b****'</p>

<p>Ron then flirted with Leah, who recalled that he'd kissed her friend months ago, and sent her a message saying that he was 'gonna f*** the life out of her.'</p>

<p>'You're at your prime right now,' he told Leah. 'I can make you shine.'</p>

<p>'Okay, thank you,' replied Leah, who rolled her eyes for the cameras.</p>

<p>Good effort: Ron then flirted with Leah, who recalled that he'd kissed her friend months ago, and sent her a message saying that he was 'gonna f*** the life out of her'</p>

<p>Sonja got onstage to give a speech, and nagged Ramona for bringing her 'boring friends.'</p>

<p>'Did she just say I'm boring?' Ron asked, suddenly at Leah's ear, which made her scream.</p>

<p>When the actual bingo game started, Dorinda got really into it, yelling 'Yes!' every time she was able to put a chip on her sheet.</p>

<p>Plus one: 'Did she just say I'm boring?' Ron asked, suddenly at Leah's ear, which made her scream</p>

<p>Ramona spotted '69' on Dorinda's sheet and bent down, saying, 'I like 69!' before accidentally making Dorinda's chips scatter.</p>

<p>'This is about the community!' Sonja told Ramona. 'It's not about your va-jay-jay!'</p>

<p>She then brought Luann up onstage to perform Viva La Diva, which got the whole crowd dancing and singing along.</p>

<p>Catchy song: Luann was brought up onstage to perform Viva La Diva, which got the whole crowd dancing and singing along</p>

<p>'At least it's not Happy Birthday,' cracked Dorinda, who recalled with horror Luann's Marilyn Monroe-style rendition of that song from her recent birthday dinner.</p>

<p>At the end of the show, special credits gave updates on the cast's recent activities.</p>

<p>Luann was writing a memoir, it said, and she had just sold her vacation home.</p>

<p>Leah said she'd grown 'so much during these last few months' of taping the show, and was ready for a new relationship. In the credits, it was revealed that she'd quit drinking again.</p>

<p>Sonja's update said she got a facelift and took her home off the market after getting no bids. She acknowledged that she sometimes went 'off the rails,' but refused to 'play the victim.'</p>

<p>Ramona's credit joked that she'd been kept busy 'maintaining 50 friendships while social distancing,' and moved to a higher floor in her building 'for more Instagrammable views.'</p>
