<p>'I wanted to create a collection that reminds me of the bright, tropical hues that recall so many happy memories,' explained Jason in a letter passed out to attendees at the show.</p>

<p>As for the collection's theme, he hoped to create a sense of 'escapism' with each ensemble 'because fashion should inspire and make us feel happy.' </p>

<p>Jason's vision was clear as models strutted down the catwalk in various resort wear worthy of a tropical getaway.</p>

<p>The designer's turn: In traditional fashion show style, Jason Wu had his own moment on the picturesque runway.</p>

<p>A good cause: Wu wore a face mask that had the phrase 'Distance Yourself From Hate' written on it, which happens to be the name of a new campaign he started in collaboration with GMNC and The Collective Shift</p>

<p>The 37-year-old Taiwanese-Canadian designer had on a plain black tee and a pair of black jeans.</p>

<p>Wu also wore a face mask that had the phrase 'Distance Yourself From Hate' written on it, which happens to be the name of a new campaign he started in collaboration with GMNC and The Collective Shift.</p>

<p>According to Jason, 'the sales of the masks' produced by the campaign will 'help provide food and protective masks to underprivileged communities.' </p>
