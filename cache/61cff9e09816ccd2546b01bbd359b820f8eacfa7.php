<p>Caroline was announced alongside Max George and Jason Bell as the first three celebrities to take part in Strictly 2020 on Tuesday's instalment of The One Show - following months of uncertainty amid the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>Caroline explained that she used to do ballet as a girl, as well as tap and modern dance, but is worried her knees will let her down.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been keeping it very quiet and it’s really difficult as I like a chat, as you well know, and it’s been so hard to be quiet about it. I’m a bit scared, but quite excited,' the Men Behaving Badly actress told The One Show hosts Alex Jones and Amol Rajan.    </p>

<p>Sitcom stars: Amanda played Caroline's assistant Mel on the sitcom</p>

<p>Early role: The comedy series followed titular Kate Salinger's job as a counselor</p>

<p>Co-stars: Amanda also acted in two episodes of Jonathan Creek in 1998, opposite Caroline, who played Maddy Magellan</p>

<p>She added: 'I do remember some of what I learned [dancing] but my knees are 50 years older than the last time I attempted any of it, and it’s my knees and my undergarments that are troubling me most as a notion.</p>

<p>'I hope my knees don’t let me down and I hope the foundation garments live up to expectations when I start leaping about!'</p>

<p>Caroline is perhaps best known for her role on sitcom Men Behaving Badly - on which she played the long-suffering girlfriend of Martin Clunes. </p>

<p>New challenge: Jonathan Creek actress Caroline explained that she used to do ballet as a girl, as well as tap and modern dance, but is worried her knees will let her down</p>

<p>Hitting the dance floor! Max George of former boy band The Wanted will also appear with Caroline on Strictly this autumn</p>

<p>The celebrity contestants on this year's Strictly will be asked to 'bubble' with their dance partners for the duration of the series, which is set to be shorter - nine weeks instead of the normal 13 - and quieter, with no live audience to clap and boo.</p>

<p>Judge Bruno Tonioli will be dialling in from Los Angeles for the first five weeks, unable to travel back and forth from his duties at Dancing With The Stars due to the pandemic's travel rules.</p>

<p>The BBC's head of entertainment, Kate Phillips, said: 'Strictly is a slightly shorter run but, apart from that, I don't think it will be a lesser show at all. If anything, I think this series will be rather special.' </p>
