<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A gaggle of geese brought motorists in south-east London to a halt over the weekend as the vehicles were forced to wait while the birds crossed a road to safety. </p>

<p>Motorists waited patiently in Blackheath on Sunday by a convoy of Canada Geese crossing a road between two patches of grass.</p>

<p>The birds were filmed disrupting the traffic at 7.15pm by resident Theresa Mcclafferty, 51.</p>

<p>A lare gaggle of geese crosses a road between two patches of grassland in Blackheath, South East London, on Sunday September 6</p>

<p>In the footage, the geese cross the road in an orderly queue and slowly waddle across, determined not to break rank.</p>

<p>A line of cars are seen stretching as far back as the eye can see as they all wait for the birds to safely cross over the road.</p>

<p>A crowd of passersby gathered either side of the procession of geese in awe of the impressive convoy.</p>

<p>Speaking about the incredible sight, Theresa said: 'It was a pleasure to watch and brought a smile to my face.</p>

<p>The convoy of geese causes a backlog of patient traffic which stretches as far back up the road as the eye can see</p>

<p>'It happens almost every day as they head home in the evening. They feed on the heath all day, have a swim in the pond and then home at dusk. It's a real joy to watch but 1st time I filmed it.'</p>

<p>The geese are a common sight in Blackheath, having two regular watering holes at the Prince of Wales and Hare and Billet ponds.</p>

<p>Canada Geese were introduced to the UK from North America and have since successfully spread across most of the country.</p>

<p>It is estimated that there are around 62,000 mating pairs of the birds in the UK. </p>
