<p>The one-hour show on CBS opened with an intense endurance challenge to become Head of Household for the upcoming week.</p>

<p>The houseguests were challenged to remain on a billboard promoting the upcoming movie Power Trip as it periodically tilted forward with occasional cold water drenches.</p>

<p>New leader: Dani Donato won a torturous endurance competition to become Head of Household on Sunday's episode of Big Brother All-Stars on CBS</p>

<p>The contestants used hand grips to try to remain against the wall and Da'Vonne Rogers, 32, declared her intention to win after her best friend Bayleigh Dayton, 27, was evicted.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne, however, was the first to be eliminated and also became a Have-Not for the week.</p>

<p>She was followed off the wall by David, 30, and Ian Terry, 29, who both joined Da'Vonne as Have-Not houseguests.</p>

<p>Dani, 34, was intent on lasting longer than Tyler Crispen, 25, who wronged her even though they are both members of The Committee six-person alliance.</p>

<p>Eviction notice:  David Alexander and Kevin Campbell were nominated for eviction by Dani</p>

<p>She not only beat out Tyler but also everyone else and won the Head of Household competition and the right to nomimate two houseguests for eviction.</p>

<p>David realized he could be a target, but he also was holding the Disruptor power that allows him to remove someone up for eviction, including himself.</p>

<p>'I have told no one about my power and I don't intend to,' David said.</p>

<p>Endurance competition: The houseguests were challenged to remain on a billboard promoting the upcoming movie Power Trip as it periodically tilted forward with occasional cold water drenches</p>

<p>The winner: Dani was intent on lasting longer than Tyler Crispen, but won the whole competition</p>

<p>Kevin, 40, also figured he would be nominated as he described Dani as being a 'stone statue' with him.</p>

<p>Da'Vonne talked to Dani and tried to convince her to put Christmas Abbott, 38, up for eviction along with Tyler.</p>

<p>Cody Calafiore, 29, meanwhile urged Dani to put Kevin up for eviction.</p>

<p>Good talk: Da'Vonne Rogers talked to Dani and tried to convince her to put Christmas Abbott, 38, up for eviction along with Tyler</p>

<p>She complained that Tyler was coming after her and Cody jokingly suggested she also put him on the block.</p>

<p>'Just kidding. Don't put him on the block. Put him on the block, he'll win the veto,' Cody warned her of Tyler.</p>

<p>Tyler also spoke to Dani to check in on her plans.</p>

<p>Just kidding: Dani complained that Tyler was coming after her and Cody Calafiore jokingly suggested she put him on the block, too</p>

<p>'I won't be mad at you if you put me up. Or backdoor me, because I know I deserve it at this point,' Tyler said.</p>

<p>'Shut up, Tyler,' replied Dani.</p>

<p>Dani admitted in a confessional that she was torn about her decision.</p>

<p>Checking in: 'I won't be mad at you if you put me up. Or backdoor me, because I know I deserve it at this point,' Tyler told Dani</p>

<p>'Tyler was putting himself on my radar for last couple of weeks. And now I'm in a position where I can come after him, but if I come after Tyler, there's an opportunity for him to really hurt my game. So the big question is, do I take the shot this week or not?,' Dani said.</p>

<p>Dani later told her fellow alliance member Nicole Franzel, 28, that she was going to put Kevin and David up for nomination, but also was considering a backdoor move to eliminate Tyler.</p>

<p>'I don't trust him at all,' Dani told Nicole, who was against targeting their alliance member Tyler.</p>

<p>Tough decision: 'Tyler was putting himself on my radar for last couple of weeks. And now I'm in a position where I can come after him, but if I come after Tyler, there's an opportunity for him to really hurt my game. So the big question is, do I take the shot this week or not?,' Dani said</p>

<p>Kevin met with Dani who stood by her strategy of trying to convince him that he was pawn and not an actual target.</p>

<p>Dani swore that she would 'never, ever' want him out of the house.</p>

<p>She also sought insurance from Tyler and they both agreed not to target each other until only their alliance members remained.</p>

<p>Game pawn: Kevin met with Dani who stood by her strategy of trying to convince him that he was pawn and not an actual target</p>

<p>'Tyler is the type of person, if you're going to swing, you can't miss,' Dani said in a confessional as she continued to weigh her options.</p>

<p>Dani during the nomination ceremony revealed that she put Kevin and David up for eviction.</p>

<p>'I nominated Kevin and David because they're the only two people in the house I don't talk the game with,' Dani said.</p>

<p>Nomination ceremony: 'I nominated Kevin and David because they're the only two people in the house I don't talk the game with,' Dani said</p>

<p>Kevin was disappointed to be a 'pawn' again and was feeling disposable.</p>

<p>David, meanwhile, was holding onto his Disruptor power.</p>

<p>'It's time to disrupt this house,' David said.</p>

<p>Big Brother All-Stars will return Tuesday on CBS.</p>

<p>In jeopardy: Kevin was disappointed to be a 'pawn' again and was feeling disposable</p>
