<p>Discovery Island, which is located in the middle of Disney's Bay Lake and only accessible by boat, was closed to the public in 1999.</p>

<p>Given that the entire Disney World resort was closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, McGuire was able to gain access to the empty theme park under the cover of darkness before using a small motorized boat to reach the island. </p>

<p>He even documented the adventure on his camera phone and posted several videos to his YouTube channel.  </p>

<p> In one video, McGuire even claims he has been a frequent visitor to the abandoned island for more than a decade. </p>

<p>'You guys, if you all ever do this, be respectful to the next people who are explorers,'  he states. </p>

<p>'If you have a fire, make sure you put it out the next day. I've been doing this since 2004 and I've never caught anything on fire.' </p>

<p>McGuire also recorded police searching for him on the morning of April 30, with helicopters heard hovering overhead as cops combed the island to apprehend him. </p>

<p>'The island is surrounded,' he whispers to viewers in that clip. </p>

<p>McGuire documented the adventure on his camera phone and posted several videos to his YouTube channel. One clip showed him hiding in overgrown foliage while cops searched for him close by (pictured)</p>

<p>After he was detained late on the evening of April 30, McGuire claimed he had made his way to the island the night before and was 'going to stay out there for about a week.'</p>

<p>He was taken into custody and charged with the misdemeanor offence before being released  on bail. </p>

<p>McGuire is still taking to YouTube to talk to viewers about his time on the island. </p>

<p>In a recent clip uploaded late last month he stated: ''Luckily, I've already taken my daughter Disney World before I got a life ban. </p>

<p>'Who wouldn't want to go and have it all to themselves?' </p>

<p>Disney World was forced to shutter back in mid-March amid the COVID-19 outbreak, before it reopened to visitors at a reduced capacity in July. </p>
