<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A heavily pregnant Muslim woman who was targeted and stomped on during a racist attack while sitting in a café has finally broken her silence about the kind stranger who saved her and her unborn baby's life. </p>

<p>Rana Elasmar was 38 weeks pregnant and enjoying a night out with friends at dessert café Bay Vista Parramatta in Sydney's west on November 20 last year when she was brutally attacked. </p>

<p>Sickening CCTV showed Stipe Lozina, 43, dragging Ms Elasmar to the ground before he began stomping on her head and repeatedly kicking her. </p>

<p>Ms Elasmar feared she and her unborn baby would die in the attack, leaving her husband and three other children aged 7, 5 and 3, behind if it weren't for the man who stepped in. </p>

<p>'If he hadn't stepped in, he probably might have kept going. I might have been killed that night, my son might have been killed that night,' the 32-year-old mother of four told The Saturday Telegraph.   </p>

<p>Stipe Lozina, 43, leapt over the table toward Ms Elasmar (pictured) and repeatedly punched her causing her to fall to the ground where he continued to kick her</p>

<p>The former school teacher doesn't know what triggered Lozina but felt 'uneasy and uncomfortable' when he approached her and her friends asking for change. </p>

<p>Lozina then leapt over the table and threw several punches at Ms Elasmar which caused her to fall to the ground as he continued stomping and kicking at her head.</p>

<p>In that moment, a brave Ms Elasmar didn't care that Lozina was attacking her, and all she could think about was, 'that's OK, hit my head, as long as you don't hit my baby'.  </p>

<p>Lozina (pictured) pled guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and is due to be sentenced in October</p>

<p>As the punches and kicks kept coming Ms Elasmar couldn't help but anxiously wonder why no one was stopping Lozina as her friends were unable to. </p>

<p>She prayed to Allah asking for his help as he was 'the only one who can help me'.</p>

<p>Eventually, a man ran into the cafe and yanked Lozina off the terrified mother and others stepped in to help.  </p>

<p>Ms Elasmar was taken to hospital with head injuries and lingering pain in her jaw and ear.</p>

<p>She felt something wasn't right with her baby as it had stopped moving and kicking around inside her, which doctors explained could be from the trauma she felt. </p>

<p>But three weeks after the traumatising attack, Ms Elasmar gave birth to a healthy baby boy Zayn. </p>

<p>A man ran into the cafe and pulled Lozina off Ms Elasmar (pictured) who was being brutally kicked and punched</p>

<p>Ms Elasmar said she refused to 'be controlled by fear' and wants to be a role model for her children (pictured, Bay Vista Parramatta where she was attacked)  </p>

<p>She said she refuses 'be controlled by fear' or be silenced by the attack, wanting to show her young children to be strong in the face of adversity. </p>

<p>'I wanted to show them that no matter what happens we pick ourselves up and move on and I don't accept people to treat me in that way,' she said. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ms Elasmar said this was not the first time she was racially targeted because of her religion.</p>

<p>After putting on the hijab eight years ago, Ms Elasmar was told to 'go back to where you came from' and had others whisper crude comments under their breath.</p>

<p>'Just because I wear the hijab doesn't mean that I am not Australian.' </p>

<p>According to a report released by Islamophobia In Australia, 96 per cent of Muslim women who reported they were a target of Islamophobic abuse were wearing a hijab at the time. </p>

<p>Ms Elasmar said she wanted it 'known' that Lozina's attack on her was because of her religion. </p>

<p>'It's a real issue. That man (Lozina) made it known that this attack was based on his hatred of Muslims.' </p>

<p>Lozina plead guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and is due to be sentenced in October.</p>

<p>The court heard he had a violent history targeting Muslim women, after abusing two hijab wearing women at Liverpool Westfields last September.  </p>
