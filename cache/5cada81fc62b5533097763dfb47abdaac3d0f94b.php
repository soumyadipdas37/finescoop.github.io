<p>The Victorian Premier outlined the strategy on Sunday for the state to return to normality if daily COVID-19 case numbers continue to fall.</p>

<p>Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said gyms will be among some of the last businesses to reopen.</p>

<p>'Gyms are a known high risk setting. They cause outbreaks,' he told a press conference on Sunday. </p>

<p>Daniel Andrews has ruled gyms won't reopen until December at the earliest as Victoria prepares a four-step plan out of lockdown</p>

<p>Gyms in Victoria were the last in the country to reopen on June 22 after closing in mid-March. They were then forced to shut again after just two-and-a-half weeks after Mr Andrews declared a six week lockdown</p>

<p>'They are still high risk inherently because of the exertion that people are undergoing at the gym and the fact that it is an indoor setting.</p>

<p>'But boot camps are different and obviously we want to encourage those outdoor activities on those principles that it is a much, much lower risk to do anything outdoors.'</p>

<p>Prof Sutton said gyms are high risk inherently of the 'exertion' that people undergo while they're exercising, which is coupled with being indoors.   </p>

<p>Gyms and exercise studios in Victoria were the last in the country to reopen on June 22 after closing in mid-March during the first wave of coronavirus.  </p>

<p>They were then forced to shut again after just two-and-a-half weeks after Mr Andrews declared a six week lockdown.</p>

<p>Fitness Australia CEO Barrie Elvish last week slammed the Andrews Government for their refusal to budge on gym closures.</p>

<p>'For many people in our community, especially those managing a range of physical and mental health issues, going to the gym, completing regular sessions with a personal trainer or participating in a live virtual class are seen as an essential support service,' he told DMARGE. </p>

<p>A Fitness Australia study claims there have been more than 6.26 million check-ins across 423 gyms in New South Wales since restrictions eased on the 13th June, and in that time there has been no cases of community transmission from a gym. </p>

<p>'Health and fitness centres are low risk when it comes to COVID-19 and the industry is willing to do whatever it takes to provide a safe and hygienic envrionment for members and employees,' Mr Elvish said. </p>

<p>'We are not part of the problem; we are actually part of the solution to getting more Australians more active more often and help prevent long-term lifestyle-related disease.'</p>

<p>Melbourne Storm and Collingwood sports psychologist Jacqui Louder said there is a 'direct correlation' between exercise and mental health'.</p>

<p>'It's the number one mechanism for managing anxiety and stress. I have significant concerns for the community's mental health with less exercise - including at gyms - because of our response to COVID-19,' she told The Herald Sun last week. </p>
