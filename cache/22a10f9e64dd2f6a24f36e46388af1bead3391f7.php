<p>Sweet! Katherine Ryan marked her one year anniversary to her high school sweetheart Bobby Kootstra with a series of snaps on Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>Earlier this year, loved-up Katherine discussed her low-key civil partnership ceremony to Bobby. </p>

<p>The star said: 'I decided to get married basically because I got together with my high school boyfriend. His name is Bobby and we were together when I was 15 or 16 and then we got back together 20 years later. Isn't that pathetic??' </p>

<p> The pair were struck once again by Cupid's arrow when they met by chance in Katherine's local pub.</p>

<p>The stunning blonde explained that 20 years on, they had both matured and quipped that her civil partner's previous divorce had acted as a mellowing effect. </p>

<p>Katherine said: 'Bobby had a life of 20 years while I wasn't with him, he's divorced. I love divorced men, it really humbles them.</p>

<p>In her trademark self-deprecating style, Katherine joked that she looks unrecognisable from her 15-year-old self and is unsure if Bobby has realised they used to date.</p>

<p>She said: 'It's very different. Literally speaking, a lot of my face is different. I don't even know if he knows I'm his high school girlfriend.'</p>
