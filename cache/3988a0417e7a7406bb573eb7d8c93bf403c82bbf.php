<p>In an interview with MailOnline, the Love Island star, whose younger sibling Llŷr tragically passed away aged 19 in July, detailed his new Fresher &amp; Healthy campaign, aiming to safeguard students’ mental and physical health as they return to university amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>EXCLUSIVE 'No one is alone': Dr Alex George has revealed losing his brother has encouraged him to do 'everything in his power' to help others struggling with mental health issue</p>

<p>'As an A&amp;E doctor, it is very important to me to make sure people are aware that they must act if they are experiencing feelings of depression, anxiety or stress.'</p>

<p>The media personality went on to stress the importance of reaching out to others, adding:  'No one is alone in their battle with mental health, there are people and organisations that can help. It’s so important that we get the message out there that young people can and should ask for help if they are not feeling well mentally. </p>

<p>'There is always someone you can speak to whilst at university and it’s just making sure that students are aware of the resources out there to help them. For instance at Scape, there is always somebody to talk to, be it the reception team (who are mental health trained) or Scape’s Wellbeing Manager. </p>

<p>'There is also an app that students can use to ask for help from the comfort of their own room. Helping young adults to feel safe, by providing them with the correct medical insights and practical health advice, is an area I’m very passionate about personally.' </p>

<p>Explaining the effects of his schedule on his mental health, the TV star told us: 'Being on the frontline has taken its toll mentally on doctors and nurses over the past few months.</p>

<p>Alex said: 'In the wake of the pandemic, there has been a huge amount of misinformation and fake news that has been posted and shared across social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter. </p>

<p>'I have seen so many ridiculous articles that provide inaccurate and false information that gets shared on these platforms, which can be hugely concerning and damaging to people’s mental health.</p>

<p>'Whilst I do believe that overall social media is a positive space that when used correctly can provide a sense of community, I have found that the use of too much screen time can take its toll on our mental health. </p>
