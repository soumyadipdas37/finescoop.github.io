<p>And on Monday the 51-year-old Bronx native was at it again as she emerged with a double print outfit that hid the curves she flaunted in her 2019 stripper film Hustlers. </p>

<p>Also with the mother-of-two was her fiance, 45-year-old baseball veteran turned commentator Alex Rodriguez who was more subdued in dark gray.</p>

<p>Let's get loud: Jennifer Lopez has been seen almost daily in New York City in an array of outfits that don't look like her typical Jenny From The Block style. And on Monday the 51-year-old Bronx native was at it again</p>

<p>The movie and TV star also shared a look at her new film on Monday. It's called Marry Me and co-stars Owen Wilson, and Colombian singer, songwriter, and actor Maluma.</p>

<p>Lopez shared the romantic comedy would be released on Valentine's Day, February 14, in 2021.</p>

<p>As far as her Monday look, J-Lo had on a low-cut floral maxi dress with a patchwork of patterns that included a cit scene, a plant, and some tiles.</p>

<p>The motorcycle jacket had the same mish-mash of prints, even including a red parrot. </p>

<p>Ain't it funny? J-Lo had on a low-cut floral maxi dress with a patchwork of patterns that included a cit scene, a plant, and some tiles. The motorcycle jacket had the same mish-mash of prints, even including a red parrot</p>

<p>Together, it was a lot to take in but still had an elegant style of its own, probably better for Capri than the Big Apple.</p>

<p>Jenny added strappy beige heels, a green crocodile mini purse, a floppy straw hat and a black mask as she walked to a waiting SUV. And she flashed her big diamond engagement ring from her future husband.</p>

<p>Even though her mask hid much of her face, it was still apparent that the Second Act actress has on heavy eye makeup.</p>

<p>Alex went for a more casual look with an all grey outfit.</p>

<p>My love don't cost a thing: Also with the mother-of-two was her fiance, 45-year-old baseball veteran turned commentator Alex Rodriguez</p>

<p>There was no sign of their combined four children - she has Max and Emme, both 12, with ex-husband Marc Anthony, and he has Natasha, 15, and Ella, 12, with his ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.</p>

<p>Lopez has been seen in the past week taking meetings, often at al fresco lunches with her manager Benny Medina by her side.</p>

<p>It's been a tense few months for Jennifer and A-Rod as they head a consortium focused on purchasing the New York Mets baseball franchise from the the Wilpon and Katz families. </p>

<p>New film: The star also shared a look at her new film on Monday. It's called Marry Me and co-stars Owen Wilson and Maluma</p>

<p>A bride yet again: Lopez shared the romantic comedy would be released on Valentine's Day, February 14, in 2021</p>

<p>But according to Newsday, billionaire Steve Cohen looks to be the frontrunner to acquire the storied franchise, with his drive to buy the team going 'smoothly' and with 'no obstacles.' </p>

<p>An insider told the outlet that the transaction should become later this month, at which time Cohen would need to be voted in by 23 of 29 fellow owners.</p>

<p>The developments come days after Jennifer and Alex's side said she would be in control of the franchise - making her baseball's first female Latina owner, and that they would pay $100 million to charity if the team didn't win the World Series in 10 years or less.</p>

<p>Their love is big; The lovebirds had to delay their wedding due to COVID-19 but will likely wed when her new film comes out next year </p>

<p>'It ain’t over until it is over,' Lopez told the New York Post on Tuesday, quoting late baseball icon Yogi Berra.</p>

<p>She continued, 'We are New Yorkers and we are not going to give up. We feel we have the best bid for the sport, the team and the city.'</p>

<p>'I would be the control person,' Jennifer said of the planned arrangement with the former MLB shortstop if they were to buy the baseball club from the Wilpons-Katz group.</p>

<p>Alex, a former player with the New York Yankees, Texas Rangers and Seattle Mariners, told the publication that their bid was comparable to Cohen's $2.35 billion bid.</p>

<p>Jennifer and Alex previously said via social media that they had 'informed the Mets that they are no longer pursuing the acquisition of the team,' but took down the posts later on. Cohen's initial move to buy the team came earlier this year, but complications have delayed the sale of the team.   </p>

<p>He wants to co-own a baseball team: It's been a tense few months for Jennifer and A-Rod as they head a consortium focused on purchasing the New York Mets baseball franchise from the the Wilpon and Katz families</p>
