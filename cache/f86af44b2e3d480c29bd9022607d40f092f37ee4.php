<p>The former Tottenham midfielder says the Danish players want to support the anti-racism protests after revealing the English FA asked them to back the Black Lives Matter campaign ahead of the Nations League match.</p>

<p>But a controversy has been simmering in his homeland as Morten Messerschmidt, deputy chairman of the Danish People’s Party, said it is ‘dangerous’ to mix sport and politics.</p>

<p>Christian Eriksen says that Denmark players will show solidarity with England in taking a knee</p>

<p>That has caused a major debate in Denmark but the players, according to Eriksen, want to take a knee.</p>

<p>Inter Milan star Eriksen: ‘I do not see why it should be a problem of any kind at all. We all support the fight against all forms of racism.</p>

<p>‘And if it can create a little extra focus, then I think we could do it.’</p>

<p>Eriksen says the players want to perform the gesture despite the poliitical row in Denmark</p>

<p>Denmark midfielder Thomas Delaney said it is a 'no brianer' to support the movement</p>

<p>Denmark’s Borussia Dortmund midfielder Thomas Delaney also said it was a ‘no brainer’ and they should do it no matter the possible implications after the final whistle.</p>

<p>‘I think it is quite nice that politics and sports — when we are in such situations here at least — are mixed together,’ Delaney said.</p>

<p>‘It was a wish from the English, which we support. This is the information that we have decided on. So we have to see what happens afterwards.</p>

<p>‘As I said, it was the wish of the English. They had asked UEFA if we wanted to join it, and we would very much like that.’</p>
