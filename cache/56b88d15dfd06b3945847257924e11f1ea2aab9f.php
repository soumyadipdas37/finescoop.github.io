<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harry Redknapp believes Gareth Bale could lead Tottenham back into the Champions League places if the club complete a sensational transfer this summer.</p>

<p>The Real Madrid star has been linked with a move back to his former side and Redknapp, who had four years with Welshman in north London, thinks it would be a great deal for both parties.</p>

<p>Bale left Spurs for the LaLiga club in a record £86million deal in 2013, a year after Redknapp also departed White Hart Lane.</p>

<p>Harry Redknapp believes Gareth Bale could lead Tottenham back into the Champions League</p>

<p>The Real Madrid star has been linked with a move back to his former side after leaving in 2013</p>

<p>The 31-year-old has gone on to win 13 trophies in seven years but has fallen out of favour with current Real boss Zinedine Zidane and is seeking a way out. His agent Jonathan Barnett told BBC Wales that 'Gareth still loves Spurs... It's where he wants to be.'</p>

<p>And Redknapp thinks the winger would light up the Premier League once again and could take Tottenham back into contention for the top four.</p>

<p>'He'd be great for Tottenham and great for the Premier League,' Redknapp told Sky Sports News.</p>

<p>The Welshman has fallen out of favour with Zinedine Zidane and is looking for a move away</p>

<p>'It would be a great move for Gareth Bale as he needs to be playing. It's a waste of a great talent to see him not involved at a team like Real Madrid so he could really make the difference for Tottenham, that's for sure. He's such a special talent.</p>

<p>'I think Tottenham will pay a percentage of his wages. Let's say he's on £500,000-a-week, Tottenham will pay around a third of that knowing Daniel Levy. He'll certainly do a good deal for Tottenham.</p>

<p>'He's a great athlete and he's a complete all-rounder: he can run, head and shoot. Hopefully, he'll come and they'll take their time with him and bed him in slowly. He'd be such a boost for Tottenham. </p>

<p>'With a forward line of Son, Kane, Bale and Dele Alli that's a scary attacking line-up and they'd do some damage.</p>

<p>Bale became a fan favourite at Spurs where he scored 56 goals and provided 58 assists</p>

<p>'At present, I don't see them finishing in the top four, but signing Gareth would give them a much better chance of doing that. Bale would tip the balance in their favour as he's such a good player.' </p>

<p>The Wales captain became a fan favourite at Spurs where he scored 56 goals and provided 58 assists in 203 appearances.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Real Madrid will pay more than half of Bale's £500,000-per-week wages to facilitate the deal to Tottenham. </p>

<p>Chairman Daniel Levy was at the forefront of negotiations over a potential deal on Tuesday</p>

<p>Chairman Daniel Levy, who is also trying to close a deal for Real's highly-rated left-back Sergio Reguilon, was at the forefront of Tottenham's negotiations on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Sources claimed that Spurs are even prepared to use Dele Alli as a makeweight in the deal for Bale, such was their determination to clinch a return for the 31-year-old.</p>

<p>Manchester United have also been linked with the winger with AS reporting that the Red Devils are still in with a chance, despite losing ground on Spurs in the race for his signature. </p>
