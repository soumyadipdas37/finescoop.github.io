<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Royal gamekeeper was pelted with stones after attempting to stop illegal hare coursing on the Queen’s estate.</p>

<p>He confronted three men who were hunting hares with dogs, which rip their prey apart.</p>

<p>Bets of thousands of pounds can be placed on the results. The gamekeeper was left with a bruised chest in the assault at Flitcham, Norfolk.</p>

<p>The attack occurred on a newly harvested field, part of the 20,000-acre Sandringham estate, near the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s country home, Anmer Hall.</p>

<p>It is also close to the Queen’s Norfolk home where she and Prince Philip are spending a couple of weeks after leaving Balmoral.</p>

<p>Norfolk Police said the gamekeeper dialled 999 on September 3 and three men were arrested. Even though hare coursing was outlawed in 2004, it still takes place illicitly.</p>

<p>It is most common between September and March when fields are bare of crops, enabling dogs that hunt by sight to see their prey.</p>

<p>Competitors bet on dogs, with each turn they make to trap the hare earning points, plus a higher score for the one that gets the ‘kill’.</p>

<p>PC Jon Chandler, of Norfolk Police, said hare coursers were often threatening, adding: ‘The gamekeeper stated he had seen hare coursing. When he engaged with the people, they threw stones at him and caused him some minor injuries. It is a cruel sport.’</p>

<p>He said 300 incidents of hare coursing were reported in Norfolk and Suffolk every year, 600 in Cambridgeshire and 1,000 in Lincolnshire, adding: ‘Many other incidents are not reported.’</p>

<p>The unnamed gamekeeper told police his attackers fled in a green Subaru. Officers tried to pull over a car matching the description, but it failed to stop.</p>

<p>A green Subaru was found abandoned nearby and three men in their 30s were arrested on suspicion of assault, hunting mammals with dogs and driving offences.</p>

<p>The car and four lurcher-type dogs were also seized by officers.</p>

<p>The men, who were all from the area of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, were released on police bail until September 29.</p>

<p>They were arrested as part of a joint campaign against hare coursing by police forces, mostly in East Anglia, called Operation Galileo.</p>
