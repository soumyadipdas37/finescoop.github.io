<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police shut down a wedding reception after dozens of well wishers crammed into a Swansea restaurant.</p>

<p>The local authority has told the bar to close after a large number of people attended the celebration. </p>

<p>Pictures from the night appear to show people not social distancing and crammed into Adelina's Bar and Kitchen, Mumbles Road, last Thursday.</p>

<p>Guests appeared to ignore social distancing at the wedding party</p>

<p>Officers were called to the scene and they forced everyone who was there to mark the joyous event to leave.</p>

<p>Swansea Council has now issued an immediate closure notice to the owners for failing to protect customers, according to Wales Online.</p>

<p>The venue now has a fortnight to put new measures in place including controlled use of toilets and two-metre social distancing.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Adelina's Bar and Kitchen told The Sun staff had become 'overwhelmed' by the situation. </p>

<p>Staff at the restaurant say they only took a booking for 25 people for the wedding reception.</p>

<p>Staff at the restaurant claim that they were overrun at the event</p>

<p>They claim to be unaware of bookings taken in other parts of the restaurant for the same party. </p>

<p>They told The Sun: 'We only had six members of staff on for the night, as things started to get slightly out of hand the staff got overwhelmed.</p>

<p>'At this point the owner had been called who was on his way to ask everyone to leave.</p>

<p>'Before the owner could arrive though the police had attended the scene.</p>

<p>'We would like to thank all the police that attended that night and the council officers who came to the premises the next day.</p>

<p>'We would also like to take this chance to apologise for what took place in our restaurant as it wasn't our intention at all.</p>

<p>'We will be putting in much more strict coronavirus prevention measures in place in the future.'</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for South Wales Police said: 'South Wales Police responded to a report of a gathering at the Adelina's Bar and Kitchen at approximately 7.10pm on Thursday.</p>

<p>'Upon arrival officers found large number of people in attendance at a private function.</p>

<p>'The function was shut down and all attendees ordered to leave.</p>

<p>'Further enforcement action by South Wales Police and Swansea Council is currently being considered.'</p>

<p>Organisers of a wedding in Telford, Shropshire, have been fined £10,000 for breaching covid-19 rules.</p>

<p>Reports from West Mercia Police say that 120 people were celebrating at a party which they shut down at 5pm on Friday.</p>

<p>While Greater Manchester Police shut down a wedding with 70 guests on Friday night and they also handed out a £10,000 fie to the organisers.</p>

<p>Guests initially argued with the police over leaving the reception in Longsight, Manchester.</p>

<p>The Swansea wedding comes just days before Wales introduces new strict lock-down measures.</p>

<p>These will come into force from 6pm on Sunday in Cardiff and the county of Swansea.</p>

<p>While the town of Llanelli will face new restrictions from 6pm on Saturday.</p>

<p>Under the new rules people will only be able to meet people they do not live with outdoors for the time being.</p>

<p>They will not be able to leave the area without a reasonable excuse. Swansea recorded 28 new cases of coronavirus on Friday.</p>

<p>Councillor David Hopkins, cabinet member for delivery and operations and deputy leader of Swansea council, said: 'We told businesses that we would take firm action if they failed to comply with Welsh Government rules.'</p>

<p>While revelers around the county enjoyed a last night on the town before the Government's curfew bit.</p>

<p>Drinkers in Leeds, Newcastle and Manchester enjoyed a last pint before the curef imposed by the government bit.</p>
