<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crowds have cheered as workers removed a Confederate statue from outside a  Virginia courthouse 111 years after it was first erected. </p>

<p>The monument - which depicts an unnamed Confederate soldier and is titled 'At Ready'- was taken down from its foundations out front of the Albemarle County courthouse in Charlottesville on Saturday morning. </p>

<p>It was a momentous occasion for residents still reeling from the violent Unite The Right rally that took place in the city back in August 2017. The two-day demonstration, which featured Neo-Nazis brandishing tiki torches, ended in the death of a 32-year-old counter-protester. </p>

<p>'This is a magnificent moment,' local man Don Gathers, 61, told The Washington Post as he watched the statue come down.  </p>

<p> 'Much of the racial tension, strife and protest we're seeing across the country emanates from right here in Charlottesville. But now we're moving the needle in a positive way.' </p>

<p>City officials urged residents to stay home and watch a livestream of the removal on Facebook, but dozens still turned out to watch the statue be taken down </p>

<p>The Albemarle County board of supervisors voted to remove the monument last month. They subsequently agreed to spend $60,000 of taxypayer money on a local forklift crew to pull down the imposing monument. </p>

<p>An additional $3,600 of taxpayer money was also used to cover the cost of flatbed trucks, which will take the monument to its new home at the Shenandoah Valley Battlefields Foundation.</p>

<p>The foundation preserves Civil War items and monuments for historical and educational purposes. </p>

<p>City officials live streamed the removal process on the County of Albemarle Facebook page in the hopes of keeping people away from the area amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Not everyone was happy about the removal. Some on Facebook claimed it was endemic of a 'cancel culture' that will result in less freedom for all people</p>

<p>The statue taken was located just a block away from of a monument of Confederate General Robert E. Lee, which still stands </p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the small crowd of supporters from coming to the courthouse to celebrate.  </p>

<p>Not everyone was happy about the removal, though, with some saying it was endemic of a 'cancel culture' that will result in less freedom for all people. </p>

<p>'Oh look let's put away all the monuments and hide the past, now we won't ever have to remember it. Insanity...' one Facebook user complained.  </p>

<p>The statue taken was located just a block away from a controversial monument of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. </p>

<p>Proposals to remove that public display spurred the 2017 Unite The Right Rally. </p>

<p>Back in July 2017, members of the Klu Klux Klan turned out in Charlottesville to stage a protest against the removal of the Lee monument. </p>

<p>The following month, the Unite The Right rally was held.  </p>

<p>Protesters and counter-protesters clashed at the Violent Unite The Rally in Charlottesville back in August 2017 </p>

<p>Last year, a circuit court judge declared that statue cannot be removed without permission from the state because it meets classification as a 'memorial for war veterans'. A such, the judge ruled, it is protected by Virginia law.   </p>

<p> The Code of Virigina declares that it is 'unlawful for the local authorities to disturb or interfere with any monuments or memorials'. </p>

<p>Since then, the monument has been damaged with a chisel and has been spray painted with the words 'Impeach Trump'. </p>

<p>According to The Washington Post, armed right-wingers have from 'militia groups' have started their own patrols to protect the monument as a legal battle continues. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, other Confederate statues have also been torn down in recent months amid a national reckoning on race sparked by the death of unarmed black man George Floyd of Memorial Day.</p>

<p>Another statue of Robert E. Lee, which still stands in Richmond, Virginia, was plastered with graffiti amid Black Lives Matter protests.  </p>
