<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the harrowing moment a teenager who was lost at sea after falling from his paddleboard made a desperate 999 call and said: 'I'm going to drown!'</p>

<p>Alfie, 17, was separated from his paddleboard in rough waters and began struggling in the waves near Pwllheli in north Wales.</p>

<p>But his life was saved thanks to his decision to carry his mobile phone with him in a waterproof pouch in his wetsuit.</p>

<p>Alfie was able to dial 999 for help and ask for the coastguard - and a rescue helicopter plucked him from the choppy waters.</p>

<p>His harrowing call was released by the RNLI to warn other paddleboarders of the dangers out at sea.</p>

<p>During the call Alfie says: 'I'm on an... thank you... I'm like 400 now, now 400 meters off the coast. I don't know where it is, but it's by Pwllheli. There's two islands off the coast.'</p>

<p>The call handler says: 'What's the issue? What's the problem? Are you on a paddleboard or a kayak or what are you doing at the moment?'</p>

<p>Alfie: 'Right, I had a paddleboard, but now I'm drowning.'</p>

<p>Through the rest of the call Alfie cried out in panic but the call handler calmly tells him: 'Don't panic Alfie. Just stay on your back, stay awake and keep your mouth shut.'</p>

<p>At one point Alfie says: 'I'm going to drown.'</p>

<p>But the handler tells him: 'You're not going to drown Alfie.'</p>

<p>Alfie was able to dial 999 for help and ask for the coastguard after getting into difficulty while swimming</p>

<p>His harrowing call was released by the RNLI to warn other paddleboarders of the dangers out at sea</p>

<p>Rescuers said his life was saved by the decision to wear a wetsuit and take his phone with him</p>

<p>Lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter were able to track Alfie down about 40 minutes after making the call and he was flown to hospital.</p>

<p>He was said to be confused, cold, and had swallowed a lot of seawater and was showing signs of hypothermia but was released by medics the same day.</p>

<p>Rescuers said his life was saved by the decision to wear a wetsuit and take his phone.</p>

<p>The RNLI said: 'When 17-year-old Alfie headed out on his paddleboard, he grabbed his phone and put it in a waterproof pouch. Little did he know that decision would save his life.'</p>

<p>The Abersoch lifeboat station added: 'We suggest all paddleboarders carry safety equipment and a form of communication in addition to wearing the safety leash.</p>

<p>'Get proper training, stay within your capabilities and tell someone you're going and your expected time to return.'</p>
