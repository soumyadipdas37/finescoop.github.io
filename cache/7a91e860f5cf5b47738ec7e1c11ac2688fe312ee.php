<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Extinction Rebellion protestors should 'behave like adults' and stop using floppy tactics when being arrested, one of Britain's most senior police officers has said.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Sir Steve House told the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee that Extinction Rebellion (XR) activists needed to 'stop wasting police time' when being arrested. </p>

<p>The senior officer went on to explain that floppy tactics used by the climate change group were 'a flipping nuisance' and 'a complete pain in the neck'. </p>

<p>The tactic used by some activists sees them go limp when they are being arrested and will often mean four or five people are required to carry them away. </p>

<p>The senior officer's comments come just weeks after the group took to the streets of central London after declaring a ten-day protest. </p>

<p>Sir Steve told the committee: 'We have asked them to stop being floppy. It might seem like a silly thing to say, but when we arrest them and pick them up they go all floppy, which is why you see four or five officers carrying them away.</p>

<p>'It's a complete waste of officers' time, and a complete pain in the neck. If they could just behave like sensible adults - you've made your point, you wanted to be arrested, you've been arrested, get up and walk away with one officer and stop wasting police time.</p>

<p>'This is a real issue, and they will not do it, and it is a flipping nuisance.'   </p>

<p>The police officer added: 'The problem with them going floppy and four officers carrying them away is that it looks to the general public like the police are overreacting here.</p>

<p>'We're not making them go floppy - they're just being a nuisance.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Extinction Rebellion activists held ten days of protest in central London, with the latest figures from the Met showing that 680 people had been arrested. </p>

<p>These were for alleged offences including obstructing the highway, criminal damage and breaching the legal conditions set on the demonstration.</p>

<p>This month activists were also blasted by the Prime Minister Boris Johnson for 'attacking free speech' after they chained themselves to the gates of Newsprinters in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire. </p>

<p>Protestors also blocked access to the presses in Knowsley, Liverpool, on the same evening. </p>

<p>A total of 20 activists have each been fined £10,000 for their involvement in the protest, the Met Police said.</p>

<p>Following the scenes, the Prime Minister said: 'A free press is vital in holding the government and other powerful institutions to account on issues critical for the future of our country, including the fight against climate change.</p>

<p>'It is completely unacceptable to seek to limit the public's access to news in this way.'  </p>
