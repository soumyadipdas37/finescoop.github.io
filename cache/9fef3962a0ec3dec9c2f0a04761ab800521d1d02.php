<p>Police killer Dale Cregan has reportedly been moved from a top security prison to a secure psychiatric hospital where he once bragged he lived a 'cushy' life.</p>

<p>Cregan, 37, was recently transported under armed guard from Full Sutton in York to the notorious Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside, the Mirror reported.</p>

<p>He was previously moved to the high-security psychiatric hospital in 2015, from where he wrote letters to a friend about his luxury life behind bars.</p>

<p>In a number of letters sent by the one-eyed drug dealer he described his cushy life at the facility - which was likened to a 'holiday camp' by one insider. </p>

<p>He described how he had lost weight by regularly working out at the hospital gym, played tennis and snooker, cooked pizza - although he is banned from using knives - and even enjoyed kayaking sessions in the swimming pool.</p>

<p>In a letter sent in 2016, Cregan wrote: 'I'm good bro just smashing the gym and playing snooker you know how it goes.</p>

<p>'Been doin pure circuits on the ward. You know you got your a*** kicked at snooker and tennis you had me at the kayaking tho bro (ha ha).</p>

<p>'I just train hard and come back to the ward and either do a bit on the ward or just chill in my room. </p>

<p>Cregan was told he would die in prison when he was jailed for life without parole for shooting police officers Fiona Bone (left) and Nicola Hughes (right) in 2012</p>

<p>'It's not ideal but it beats sitting on the block miles from home innit bro. Gym, phone call and a visit and I'm happy brother.'</p>

<p>Cregan, who lost an eye in a brawl years ago, was told he would die in prison when he was jailed for life without parole for shooting police officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes in 2012.</p>

<p>He was already on the run for the murders of David Short, 46, and son Mark, 23, when he killed the two policewomen after luring them to a house with a fake 999 call before shooting them 32 times on the doorstep and then throwing a grenade at them. </p>

<p>An insider claimed his reported return to Ashworth was the result of Cregan 'playing the game' to get away from Category A Full Sutton</p>

<p>The killer was jailed in 2013 and initially sent to Strangeways in Manchester, but following a psychiatric assessment prison bosses decided to send him to Ashworth.  </p>

<p>In 2018, he was declared sane and moved back to Manchester and then to Full Sutton in North Yorkshire.  </p>

<p>An insider claimed his reported return to Ashworth was the result of Cregan 'playing the game' to get away from Category A Full Sutton. </p>

<p>Two independent psychiatrists would have had to support the claim he needs specialist care for a move to the high-security psychiatric hospital to be made.</p>

<p>One-eyed Dale Cregan is currently serving a life sentence for brutally killing four people, including two policewomen, in 2012 with guns and grenades.</p>

<p>Cregan's killing spree started when he murdered amateur boxer Mark Short, 23, at a pub in Droylsden, Manchester, in April.</p>

<p>Three other people, believed to be related to the victim, were also wounded, suffering leg and back injuries.</p>

<p>Four months later Mark Short's father David was killed in a gun attack in Clayton, Manchester. Mr Short had branded his son's murderers 'cowards'.</p>

<p>Nine minutes after the incident, police received reports that shots had been fired at a second property in Droylsden, where there was also a grenade blast. Nobody was injured in the incident.</p>

<p>Detectives said they wanted to speak to Cregan, who they had released in May after linking him to the first murder but did not have the evidence to charge him.</p>

<p>In September that year the killer used a fake 999 call to lure officers Fiona Bone and Nicola Hughes to a house.</p>

<p>When they arrived, Cregan shot them and threw an M75 grenade at them. Both officers were hit by at least eight bullets as Cregan fired 32 shots in 31 seconds.</p>

<p>He later handed himself in at a police station, admitting to killing the unarmed women.</p>

<p>The gangster admitted the attempted murder of three others in a high profile court case the following year.</p>

<p>During his four-month trial, which began in February 2013, Cregan was detained at Manchester Prison.</p>

<p>The trial was held at Preston Crown Court, where scaffolding was erected to accommodate armed officers.</p>

<p>Police snipers watched over the building from nearby offices and the daily convoy, carrying Cregan between Manchester and Preston, included two prison vans, police cars, motorcycle outriders and a helicopter.</p>

<p>In total 120 Greater Manchester Police officers were deployed daily and the total cost of the trial was estimated to be in excess of £5 million.</p>

<p>Cregan was convicted of all four murders and three attempted murders and was sentenced to life imprisonment with a whole life order on June 13, 2013.</p>

<p>He was told he would never see release after admitting to the killings which prompted public outcry and an outpouring of sympathy for the police.</p>

<p>His accomplice, Anthony Wilkinson, was jailed for a minimum of 35 years for his part in the gun and grenade murder of David Short.</p>

<p>In April 2015 he was temporarily moved to the high-security psychiatric unit Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside after going on hunger strike for a second time.</p>

<p>He was said to have started refusing food at the Category A jail HMP Manchester, formerly known as Strangeways, after being moved to solitary confinement. </p>
