<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The RFU are still 'cautiously optimistic' they will be able to host 20,000 fans at Twickenham for the Barbarians match despite Government restrictions — with hopes to mitigate missing out on £100million of revenue.</p>

<p>The game on October 25 was billed to be the best attended event in Europe since lockdown. Tickets went on sale on Tuesday, the day before the Government's decision to limit gatherings.</p>

<p>RFU chief executive Bill Sweeney revealed in May that, if the autumn Tests were to be played behind closed doors, the RFU would miss out on £100m.</p>

<p>The RFU are still 'cautiously optimistic' they will be able to host 20,000 fans at Twickenham</p>

<p>'We remain cautiously optimistic,' said an RFU spokesperson.</p>

<p>They still plan to run a test event before the BaaBaas match at HQ, but that is likely to be limited to just 1,000 fans.</p>

<p>Next weekend in both European Cups there will be no fans at English or Irish-based games at Exeter, Leicester, Bristol or Leinster in Dublin. </p>

<p>But in the Premiership, Sportsmail can reveal Gloucester have been given the green light to welcome 1,000 season-ticket holders on Monday for their home match against Harlequins. </p>

<p>Barbarians game on October 25 billed to be the best attended event in Europe since lockdown</p>

<p>Clubs are scrambling for cash, with Exeter losing £1m a month, and while the Gloucester game is a small win, they are set to lose money hosting such a small number.</p>

<p>If restrictions continue or even increase, then serious concerns about a Premiership club going bust will intensify. The second-tier Championship still does not have a start date. </p>

<p>That league is holding out to only resume when crowds can return as the clubs are not viable if they have to play behind closed doors.</p>
