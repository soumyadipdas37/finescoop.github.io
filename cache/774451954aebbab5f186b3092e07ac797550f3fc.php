<p>The star, 53, said the then teenage Jack, now 32, lured him to a comedy club he had started in Manchester as the pair were both starting their careers at the time.</p>

<p>Memories: John Bishop, 53, has revealed that fellow comedian Jack Whitehall promised him £40 to do a gig but then had to pay him in laughing gas because he couldn't afford the fee</p>

<p>Liverpudlian John - now one of Britain's highest paid comedians - recalled how he first met Jack, now also a household name, at London's famous Comedy Store in the mid 2000s.</p>

<p>The comedy star had just quit his job as a pharmaceutical salesman for a career as a stand up while Jack was appearing for the first time.</p>

<p>Speaking on told Gabby Logan's Mid-Point podcast, John said: 'I remember I was compere of Jack Whitehall's first gig at the Comedy Store and he'd come to do an open spot and he was only 18,'</p>

<p>'I was on the circuit and then he went to Manchester University and phoned me up because he'd started a comedy club and booked me for £40.'</p>

<p>Trick: John said the then teenage Jack, now 32, lured him to a comedy club he had started in Manchester as the pair were both starting their careers at the time</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the comedian, the gig was not a success.</p>

<p>'He didn't give me (the £40) because they didn't sell enough tickets and he paid me in laughing gas,' the father-of-three recalled.</p>

<p>During the interview John recalled making the momentous decision to give up a full-time job at the age of 40 to enter the 'lonely' world of stand up comedy.</p>

<p>Early days: But the event was so unsuccessful that Jack - then studying for a History of Art degree - couldn't pay the fee and offered John nitrous oxide (pictured in 2008) </p>

<p>He said: 'What I found absolutely the best thing about comedy is it's a little club. You find yourself part of this strange needy society of people who want to go on stage and make people happy.</p>

<p>'So as a result there's not a single comedian I don't respect. I haven't met a comedian who is judgemental of other comedians.</p>

<p>'If you're a 40-year-old bloke going on stage and there's a 17-year-old - you're in the same boat. You're equal.'</p>
