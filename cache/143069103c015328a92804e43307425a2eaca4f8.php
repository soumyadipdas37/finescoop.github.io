<p>'There will be some shockers, as that is just part of her DNA. This has been an incredibly cathartic process for Madonna,' the insider continued. </p>

<p>'She is uncovering memories that have long been left dormant. She has done and achieved so much, so to have this time to reflect has been quite magical.' </p>

<p>In an essay for Harper's Bazaar, she wrote: 'New York wasn't everything I thought it would be. It did not welcome me with open arms. The first year, I was held up at gunpoint.</p>

<p>'Raped on the roof of a building I was dragged up to with a knife in my back, and had my apartment broken into three times. I don't know why; I had nothing of value after they took my radio the first time.'</p>

<p>She previously explained: 'I was told that if I wanted to press charges, that, you know, a physical examination, I would have to go before the court, they are going to ask you all these personal questions. </p>

<p>'You've already been violated, so then, do you want to talk about it? Do you want to make it public? No, it's just not worth it. It's too humiliating,' she said.</p>
