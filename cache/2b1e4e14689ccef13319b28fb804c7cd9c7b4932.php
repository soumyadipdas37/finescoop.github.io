<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Vegan parents who starved their baby of nutrients so badly the infant developed brain damage have avoided jail.</p>

<p>The one-year-old girl from Victoria was subjected to a strict plant-based diet which eventually landed her in the intensive care unit at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital. </p>

<p>She was fed homemade formula made up of coconut water and powders which left her with cerebral palsy caused from malnutrition in 2018.</p>

<p>In the County Court of Victoria on Monday, the parents - age 32 and 34 - were spared jail after pleading guilty to negligently causing serious injury, news.com.au reported.</p>

<p>The infant was rushed to Geelong's emergency department in August 2018 where doctors found widespread bruising, discoloured skin and rashes covering her body.</p>

<p>She also had multiple open wounds, was bleeding internally, and was kept alive with life support machines.</p>

<p>The child was in such bad shape she had severe protein-calorie malnutrition known as Kwashiorkor - a condition seen in newborns in countries experiencing famine. </p>

<p>A week before the girl's father rushed her to hospital, he penned an email to a herbal health club in the US for advice, the publication reported.</p>

<p>'[SIC] hi my 1 year old has stopped wanting to drink/eat and when she does its not staying down or she start to cough.'</p>

<p>'What can I do to help her keep it down and allow her to drink. She doesn't have a temp. She is on a fruit diet. Please help asap,' he wrote.</p>

<p>The consulate suggested he feed the infant a 'stomach tea' instead of taking her to hospital.</p>

<p>One week later, the child weighed 6.6kg - four kilos less than the average weight. She fought for her life in hospital for a month. </p>

<p>In the County Court of Victoria (pictured) on Monday, the parents - age 32 and 34 - were spared jail after pleading guilty to negligently causing serious injury</p>

<p>A nurse told the parents in an email that the coconut mixture was not nutritionally adequate for a baby.</p>

<p>Despite medical advice, the couple skipped appointments and turned to alternative medicine websites for help.</p>

<p>In one message the girl's mother sent to her partner, she asked him to talk about their daughter's 'weight loss and floppiness of her body' with the US group.</p>

<p>County Court judge Claire Quin previously condemned the parents' behaviour, particularly their decision to ignore advice from medical professionals. </p>

<p>'These parents, they weren't 19 or 20 years old, they were in their early 30s,' Judge Quin said.</p>

<p>'They're told that what they're contemplating isn't going to work for their infant, but they continue to do it.'  </p>

<p>The couple have since separated after having a second child together, and the father has renounced his vegan diet.</p>

<p>Judge Quin ordered them to serve a 12-month community corrections order and undergo mental health treatment. </p>

<p>The girl, who is now three, lives with her mother who shows 'commitment and devotion' to the child and attends medical appointments.</p>
