<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The long-awaited season finale of The Bachelor Australia, starring Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert, is just two days away.</p>

<p>And rumours are swirling that Locky's ending is going to be so chaotic, it will make Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins' last episode look like a fairytale by comparison.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that the former Australian Survivor star, 31, is rejected by his winner, and then begs his heartbroken runner-up for another chance.</p>

<p>No way! A wild theory has surfaced about the upcoming finale of The Bachelor - and it could be even more unexpected than Honey Badger's ending. Pictured: Locky Gilbert breaks down in tears and says 'f**king hell' in a trailer for the season finale</p>

<p>As fans will know, Irena Srbinovska is the bookies' favourite to steal Locky's heart - but insiders are saying that she isn't the clear-cut victor like in previous seasons.</p>

<p>If the rumours are to be believed, Locky actually dumps Irena and chooses Bella Varelis in the finale - but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena.</p>

<p>He then makes a sudden about-turn and begs the 31-year-old nurse to take him back, and she tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him.</p>

<p>Wild: Daily Mail Australia has heard whispers that Locky, 31, is rejected by his winner, and then begs his heartbroken runner-up for another chance. Promos for the season appear to support this, as Locky admits he has fallen in love with both his finalists</p>

<p>These rumours are still unconfirmed, however, and the actual outcome of The Bachelor remains a closely guarded industry secret.</p>

<p>But it's interesting that this ending seems to correlate with trailers for the series, which promise a finale 'you won't believe' as Locky is forced to choose between two women he has fallen in love with.</p>

<p>The show's executive producer, Hilary Inness, actually hinted at a Honey Badger-style ending in an interview with Media Week last month.</p>

<p>Theory: If the rumours are to be believed, Locky dumps bookies' favourite Irena Srbinovska (right) and chooses Bella Varelis (left) in the finale - but Bella turns him down because she can't handle the fact he is also in love with Irena. He then makes a sudden about-turn and begs the 31-year-old nurse to take him back, and she tentatively agrees to begin a relationship with him</p>

<p>Bombshell: This theory seems to correlate with trailers for the series, which promise a finale 'you won't believe' as Locky is forced to choose between two women he has fallen in love with</p>

<p>'Locky, by his own admission, falls in love with more than one girl,' Ms Inness said.</p>

<p>'Famously the Honey Badger couldn't choose someone, and now we have a Bachelor who has fallen in love with more than one girl, which is a first for us.'</p>

<p>For those who didn't watch the 2018 season of The Bachelor, rugby union player Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins infamously chose no one during his finale.</p>

<p>The Bachelor finale week begins Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Dropping hints: The show's executive producer, Hilary Inness, hinted at a Honey Badger-style ending in an interview last month. Pictured: 2018 Bachelor Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins</p>

<p>Couldn't make his mind up: For those who didn't watch the 2018 season of The Bachelor, rugby union player Nick 'The Honey Badger' Cummins infamously chose no one during his finale</p>
