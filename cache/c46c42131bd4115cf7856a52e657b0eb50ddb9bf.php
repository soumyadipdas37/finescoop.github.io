<p>Chicago restaurant PB&amp;J is offering what it claims to be the world's most expensive peanut butter and jelly sandwich with an eye-watering $350 (£261) price tag.</p>

<p>The luxury version of the American classic includes gold leaf-dusted bread, a special redcurrant jam imported from France, all-natural peanut butter and a rare Manuka honey from New Zealand.</p>

<p>Chicago restaurant PB&amp;J has a peanut and butter sandwich on the menu fit for the upper crust with an eye-watering $350 (£261) price tag</p>

<p>PB&amp;J's owners, brothers Matthew and Josh McCahill, told MailOnline Travel that they originally had the idea after stumbling across a $200 (£149) dollar PB&amp;J sandwich on their travels that only featured a gold toothpick.</p>

<p>They decided that they could top that idea at their new family-friendly restaurant in Chicago's West Loop. </p>

<p>Matthew says that the sandwich, listed on the menu as the 'Golden Goose', is quite unlike one he's had before.</p>

<p>Restaurant owner Matthew McCahill says that the sandwich, listed on the menu as the 'Golden Goose', is quite unlike one he's had before</p>

<p>The luxury version of the American classic includes gold leaf-dusted bread, a special redcurrant jam imported from France, all-natural peanut butter and a rare Manuka honey from New Zealand</p>

<p>He selected a special jam from French company, Maison Dutriez that he found while travelling through Europe.</p>

<p>For more than 600 years, the condiment brand has employed a painstaking technique which sees red and white currants carefully de-seeded using a feather quill.</p>

<p>Matthew said: 'The redcurrant berries burst with flavour and the honey is delicious and decadent. It's hedonism in the mouth. '</p>

<p>Diners who purchase the 'Golden Goose' can also take home the remainder of the jam and honey jars</p>

<p>The expensive sandwich must be ordered by guests 24 hours in advance of their visit. Diners who purchase the 'Golden Goose' can also take home the remainder of the jam and honey jars. </p>

<p>A percentage of the sandwich proceeds are donated to Chicago Hopes for Kids, a charity which provides educational support for children living in homeless shelters.</p>

<p>And although the peanut butter sandwich has become the star attraction of PB&amp;J, the restaurant's acronym PB&amp;J actually stands for 'Pizza, Beer &amp; Jukebox'. </p>
