<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Russian politician Alexei Navalny is back up and walking just days after being taken off a ventilator.</p>

<p>Navalny, the political opponent of Russian president Vladimir Putin, shared a photo of himself walking down stairs at Berlin's Charité Hospital, where he is continuing his recovery from being poisoned in late August.</p>

<p>He has said he intends to return to Russia as western governments demand an explanation from the Kremlin. </p>

<p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny is "continuing to improve," doctors say. He shared a photo and an update about his recovery from novichok nerve agent poisoning, writing that doctors at Berlin's Charité Hospital had transformed him from "technically alive" to someone with a chance at a real recovery. He said he still has issues pouring water and using his phone, but is up and walking after being taken off a ventilator earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Laboratory tests confirmed Navalny, who was airlifted to Germany after falling ill in Siberia, was poisoned with a novichok nerve agent that is tightly controlled by the Russian government.</p>

<p>Navalny shared an update of his recovery on Instagram, posting a photo of him walking downstairs in the hospital wearing a navy blue t-shirt, sweatpants, and blue rubber gloves. </p>

<p>He said: "This is a clear road, albeit a long one."</p>

<p>Navalny wrote that he has trouble pouring himself some water and using his phone, describing it as "useless as a stone".</p>

<p>Russian president Vladimir Putin (right) called accusations about possible Kremlin involvement in Navalny's poisoning "unsubstantiated" in a call with French president Emmanuel Macron (left). Navalny is Putin's political rival and a vocal critic of the long-standing leader (file photo).</p>

<p>He said "there are so many problems still to be solved" but that doctors had transformed him from "technically alive" to someone who had a chance of living a normal life again.</p>

<p>Charité Hospital said on Monday that Navalny's condition "continues to improve".</p>

<p>"The patient has been successfully removed from mechanical ventilation. He is currently undergoing mobilization and is able to leave his bed for short periods of time."  </p>
