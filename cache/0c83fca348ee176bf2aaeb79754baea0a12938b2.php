<p>The latest show comes after Ofcom announced they will not investigate the 24,500 complaints made concerning Diversity's Black Lives Matter inspired dance, which aired on September 5. </p>

<p>Awestruck: It's clear to see the judges were moved by her performance as David is seen closing his eyes in enjoyment as he mouths along to the words, while Alesha could barely take her eyes off Belinda</p>

<p>The performance, which featured BGT guest judge Ashley Banjo, has now become the second-most complained about television moment of the decade, but a spokesperson for the government-approved regulatory body has confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken.</p>

<p>The representative said: 'We carefully considered a large number of complaints about this artistic routine, an area where freedom of expression is particularly important.</p>

<p>'Diversity's performance referred to challenging and potentially controversial subjects, and in our view, its central message was a call for social cohesion and unity.</p>

<p>Powerful move: Earlier this month, Ofcom announced they will not investigate the 24,500 complaints made concerning the dance aired on September 5 (Ashley pictured)</p>

<p>'Any depictions of violence by the performers were highly stylised and symbolic of recent global events, and there was no explicit reference to any particular political organisation – but rather a message that the lives of black people matter.'</p>

<p>Troupe leader Ashley reacted to the news on Instagram as he shared the statement and penned: 'Creativity is always a leap of faith. All I did what was what felt right and I'd do it 100 times over... Sending love to everyone that stood by us'.</p>

<p>The routine, which narrated the death of black man George Floyd beneath the knee of a white police officer, divided fans after it aired during the live show.</p>

<p>Decision: A spokesperson for government-approved regulatory body Ofcom confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken for Diversity's BLM-inspired routine </p>
