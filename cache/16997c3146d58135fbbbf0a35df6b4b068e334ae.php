<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wife has been allowed to be next to her husband of 25 years just once in six months in a care home despite neither of them having Covid-19.</p>

<p>Sue Lindsay has barely been able to hold or touch 78-year-old Parkinson's disease sufferer Alex.</p>

<p>The former national newspaper journalist has never had coronavirus, and his wife is also healthy.</p>

<p>But the pandemic has triggered the Burscough care home where he now lives to practically ban all close contact between them.</p>

<p>At one stage the Beaufort nursing home in the West Lancashire town allowed Mrs Lindsay to stand in the porch, nine feet away, while her husband was wheeled into the hallway. </p>

<p>Now, that has changed to meetings over a fence, with the 72-year-old standing in the car park as her husband is brought into the home's garden.</p>

<p>Alex Lindsay has Parkinson's disease and is cared for by Beaufort nursing home in West Lancashire, where visits from his wife of 25 years have been restricted </p>

<p>The situation has become so upsetting that Mrs Linsday has written to her MP Rosie Cooper who has referred her case to Health Secretary Matt Hancock.</p>

<p>The former bank worker and legal secretary told the Liverpool Echo:  'It's a dreadful situation.</p>

<p>'I've not been close up to him, just once when we went to see a specialist in St Helens.</p>

<p>'Every time I leave the care home, I feel like someone has died.'</p>

<p>The mum-of-two added: 'Driving away is the most painful part. It's not the home's fault, but I don't think Alex is getting the care he needs.'</p>

<p>Alex has barely been able to hold or touch his wife Sue in rhe past six months, and he tells her he feels like he is 'in a prison'</p>

<p>The ex-Sunday Express reporter's weight has plummeted to a frail seven stone since he first went into the Beaufort in mid-March.</p>

<p>The published author collapsed earlier this year and went to Southport Hospital where he was understood to have had pneumonia.</p>

<p>Along with the Parkinson's, his speech has been badly affected.</p>

<p>Mrs Lindsay said: 'In Alex's own words, 'I'm bored, I feel like I'm in prison'.</p>

<p>'He's been going downhill, off his food, stopped trying to walk on his zimmer frame.</p>

<p>'Alex has worked all his life, paid his dues, it's not right that this is the way he now has to live, with no real time with family and friends.</p>

<p>'He has six grandchildren and has not got the lift of seeing them, he's just trapped in there.' </p>

<p>Mrs Lindsay, who has been shielding to avoid infection, has not shown any symptoms, like his wife, but contact remains prohibited.</p>

<p>Mrs Lindsay added: 'I am full of admiration for the care home staff who work tirelessly to ensure the safety and comfort of the residents, but I feel this restriction on access is unfair and unjust and detrimental to residents' mental health.</p>

<p>The situation has become so upsetting that Mrs Linsday has written to her MP Rosie Cooper who has referred her case to Health Secretary Matt Hancock (pictured above)</p>

<p>'More should be being done to facilitate a more normal contact between husband and wife.</p>

<p>'I am aware of the risks, but staff and health professionals come and go in and out of the home on a daily basis. Any one of them could spread the virus.'</p>

<p>Alex, a newspaper journalist for 40 years, covered the Troubles in Northern Ireland for the Sunday Express.</p>

<p>He went on to edit and own a newspaper on Rhodes, Greece, and was News Editor of the Gulf News in Dubai.</p>

<p>The nursing home has been contacted for comment.</p>
