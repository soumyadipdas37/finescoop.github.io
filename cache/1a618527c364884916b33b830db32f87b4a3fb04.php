<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Edouard Mendy will be in the Chelsea squad for the first time at Tottenham tomorrow.</p>

<p>But Frank Lampard has hit out at some of the ‘unfair’ criticism of the man Mendy has been bought to challenge, Kepa Arrizabalaga.</p>

<p>Goalkeeper Mendy joined for £22m from Rennes last week though Saturday’s trip to West Brom was considered too soon for his first involvement.</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy will be in the squad for the first time against Tottenham in the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>However, Lampard has hit out at some of the ‘unfair’ criticism of under-fire Kepa Arrizabalaga</p>

<p>That will be at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium tonight where Chelsea head for their Carabao Cup fourth round tie.</p>

<p>Lampard said: ‘Mendy and [Ben] Chilwell are in the squad so they are fit, so we will see if they start or not. Very positive, the early signs and interactions [with Mendy], just as a man and also on the training pitch. </p>

<p>'He has settled in very well in those few days and we’ve made him very welcome, as always so it is competition. He is a good goalkeeper. We know that. We know a lot about him and we will see how we go.’</p>

<p>Mendy’s arrival came just a few days after Kepa suffered another setback when a poor attempted pass out gifted Liverpool a second goal in their 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge, increasing the scrutiny of the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Mendy will play over Caballero, who had an embarrassing start to their game with West Brom</p>

<p>Kepa was then left out of the 3-3 draw at West Brom on Saturday, his place taken by Willy Caballero.</p>

<p>Lampard added: ‘No, I certainly won’t go to the point that he has played his last game for Chelsea.</p>

<p>‘It has been a difficult time for Kepa. I think that is well-documented. I know it and he knows it but we should certainly not jump to that conclusion and also I think, which I felt quite strongly about in the last week, is also understand that Kepa is a young man and a lot of the highlight and spotlight on him has become unfair.</p>

<p>‘I have to protect him because he is a good lad playing with absolute professionalism and intent to do the best he can as all the squad have to and that’s as much as I want to say about it now.’</p>
