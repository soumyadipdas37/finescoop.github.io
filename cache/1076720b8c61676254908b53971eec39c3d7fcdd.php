<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have insisted the glittering Invictus Games fundraiser set to take place next summer for wounded soldiers was axed because of Covid-19 and not due to their £112million deal with Netflix. </p>

<p>The glittering music and comedy show was set to be held in California in June 2021 and broadcast on Amazon, with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex planning to make speeches during the event. </p>

<p>The fundraiser, which organisers hoped would raise at least £1million for the Invictus Games Foundation, would have likely taken place at The Hollywood Bowl. </p>

<p>Beyonce and Ed Sheeran were among the stars earmarked to perform at the event. </p>

<p>There were claims over the weekend that organisers were 'stunned,' after the event was pulled due to a reported 'conflict'.</p>

<p>The Sussexes have hit back at those claims today, with lawyers for the couple saying: 'The true position is that the format of the event was no longer viable in light of COVID 19. </p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have vehemently denied claims that the Invictus Games fundraiser, set to take place in June 2021, was pulled due to a 'conflict,' between streaming services Amazon and Netflix</p>

<p>Lawyers for the couple say the fundraiser was cancelled as it was 'no longer viable,' due to Covid-19. The Duchess of Sussex met athletes during the Wheelchair Basketball Final at the Invictus Games in 2018</p>

<p>'These factors were separate to and independent of our client’s deal with Netflix.'</p>

<p>An Invictus spokesperson had previously said the event was 'shelved,' due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>They said: 'The event was shelved because the primary revenue generator was ticket sales from a live concert in Los Angeles in the spring of 2021. </p>

<p>'Given current circumstances with Covid, the event needed to be reconceptualised.</p>

<p>'This was an independent decision made prior to a partnership with Netflix. The duke remains committed as ever to the Invictus Games.' </p>

<p>Prince Harry created the Invictus Games in 2014, he's pictured meeting Mark Ormrod of Team UK at the indoor rowing competition in 2017 </p>

<p>The 2020 Invictus Games which was due to be held in April were called off because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex signed a deal with Netflix, thought to be worth £112 million, earlier this week for their new yet-to-be-named production company to make documentaries, feature films, scripted shows and children's programming. </p>

<p>They vowed to make 'impactful content that unlocks action' and name-checked Netflix chief executive Ted Sarandos and spoke of the firm's 'unprecedented reach'.</p>

<p>They are expected to make content which includes the topic of mental health, as well as an animated series about women, a nature documentary and shows on community service.</p>
