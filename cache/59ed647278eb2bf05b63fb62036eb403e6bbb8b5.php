<p>This might be the cutest form of alternative medicine. Two orphan baby sloths are treated for mange dressed in what looks like a 'Onsie'.</p>

<p>The twin sloths may look cute in the alternative outfits but actually it is a way of ridding their tiny bodies of the parasitic mites.</p>

<p>Snug: The orphan sloth look like they are wearing pyjamas during their treatment for mange</p>

<p>As the sloths have been orphaned they are more likely to pick up infection</p>

<p>They might be a growing trend for humans but the baby sloths didn't seem to mind either.</p>

<p>Since not being reared by their mother, they are more prone to infection because they lack the antibodies provided by their mother's milk.</p>

<p>In their case they have been suffering with a nasty case of mange - a skin infection caused by mites which hide in the fur and on the skin.</p>

<p>The tiny creatures have to be shaved to get rid of the mites which hide in their fur</p>

<p>The bare little bodies of the sloth then is covered in a mixture of sulphur and lard</p>

<p>Lucky for them, the pair have been taken care of by sanctuary owner Judy Avey-Arroyo in Costa Rica.</p>

<p>She has used her home remedy system to treat them. The first stage was to shave the babies - completely removing the fur, which in turn removes all of the mites.</p>

<p>Next, she smothers their bare skin with a balm made of sulfur and lard, which soothes the skin and suffocates any remaining mites.</p>

<p>The body of the sloth is then wrapped in bandages to stop the balm coming off</p>

<p>The orphan looks cosy in his new bandages, which look like pyjamas</p>

<p>The final stage the creatures are swaddled in bandages to keep them from licking off the balm.</p>

<p>The colourful bandages look like the animals are in their pyjamas.</p>

<p>In the video from Animal Planet, the pair can be seen cuddling up to one another, which apparently is common for orphans sloths.</p>
