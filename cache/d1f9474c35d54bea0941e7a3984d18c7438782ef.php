<p>Speaking out:  Sam's close friend Pete Wicks recently admitted he has warned him against getting back with Zara t following the couple's shock split</p>

<p>'Although we're from different backgrounds and people assume we wouldn't get on, we do spend a lot of time with each other.</p>

<p>'He's had a rough time recently. If there's one person that is probably worse when it comes to dating than me, it's Sam Thompson.</p>

<p>'Sam overthinks everything – I have never known anyone to overthink like he does. Sometimes I think he can be too nice. He's made mistakes, he's made a number of them but he's a really, really nice geezer and I think sometimes people try to pull the wool over his eyes.' </p>

<p>Don't mind me: Charley is a south Wales based illustrator, make-up artist an aspiring social media personality</p>

<p>He added: 'It didn't work out for me trying to give things another go… as far as I'm concerned, what goes on between Sam and Zara isn't really my place to say until they come out and openly discuss everything.</p>

<p>'But in my opinion he needs to concentrate on himself and making himself happy. It's been a rough ride for him.</p>

<p>'It's not nice to see someone as down so as what he has been about it but he will bounce back, we all bounce back.'</p>
