<p>Emmanuel Adebayor has become a surprise transfer target for Premier League West Brom</p>

<p>Adebayor has scored 97 goals in England's top flight and has been training twice a day at his home in Ghana in hope of being given an opportunity to take his tally to a century.  </p>

<p>Turkish club Fenerbahce have also shown interest in Adebayor, but the veteran forward has expressed his desire to join a fifth Premier League club of his career.  </p>

<p>He arrived in England upon leaving Monaco for Arsenal in 2006 in a deal worth £3million, scoring 62 goals in 142 appearances before joining Manchester City in 2009.</p>

<p>Adebayor ran the length of the pitch to taunt Arsenal fans after scoring for Man City in 2009</p>

<p>The Lome-born star enjoyed a loan spell at Real Madrid then joined Tottenham, netting 42 goals in 113 games over four years with the North London club. </p>
