<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Transgender people will not be allowed to legally change gender without a medical diagnosis after the Government scrapped plans to allow them to 'self identify' as men or women.</p>

<p>A consultation was launched in 2018 on overhauling the 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA) to allow 'self-ID' in England and Wales - a reform opponents said could allow predatory men access to women-only spaces such as toilets.</p>

<p>Women and Equalities Secretary Liz Truss revealed today that while the self-identification change would be dropped, the cost to trans people of changing their birth certificates will be cut from £140 pounds to a 'nominal amount' and handled online.   </p>

<p>In a long-delayed response to a public consultation on the 2004 Act, Ms Truss wrote: 'We want transgender people to be free to live and to prosper in a modern Britain.</p>

<p>'We have looked carefully at the issues raised in the consultation, including potential changes to the Gender Recognition Act 2004.</p>

<p>'It is the Government's view that the balance struck in this legislation is correct, in that there are proper checks and balances in the system and also support for people who want to change their legal sex.</p>

<p>Harry Potter author JK Rowling was threatened and attacked online after weighed into the issue earlier this year, saying she did not support self-identifying as it would be 'offering cover to predators'</p>

<p>'However, it is also clear that we need to improve the process and experience that transgender people have when applying for a gender recognition certificate, making it kinder and more straightforward.</p>

<p>'Our changes will address the main concerns that trans people themselves tell us they have about it.'</p>

<p>But trans rights advocates expressed disappointment at the decision.</p>

<p>Nancy Kelley, the chief executive of Stonewall, said: 'It's a shocking failure in leadership. While these moves will make the current process less costly and bureaucratic, they don't go anywhere near far enough toward meaningfully reforming the Act to make it easier for all trans people to go about their daily life.'</p>

<p>Some British trans rights campaigners expressed relief that the sometimes-toxic debate over the issue may now cool down.</p>

<p>Harry Potter author JK Rowling was threatened and attacked online after weighed into the issue earlier this year, saying she did not support self-identifying as it would be 'offering cover to predators', a view she said was informed by her experience of domestic violence. </p>

<p>Countries including Ireland, Portugal, Norway and Argentina have allowed self-dentification via a legal declaration and without doctors' involvement.</p>

<p>Almost two thirds of the 102,818 respondents to the British consultation said they backed removing the requirement for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria, a government report showed.</p>

<p>More than three quarters said they supported scrapping the need for trans people to show they had lived in their gender for a specific time period - currently two years.</p>

<p>But women's rights activists who had opposed changes welcomed the news.</p>

<p>'It's really good news and it acknowledges a fair balance between trans people and women's rights,' said Nicola Williams of Fair Play for Women, which campaigned against the reform.</p>

<p>She said the group's priorities would now be looking at how to ensure 'privacy, safety and fairness' when it came to trans people accessing women-only areas such as hospital wards, prisons and changing rooms.</p>

<p>In the United States, women's rights groups said in 2016 that 200 municipalities that allowed trans people to use rape crisis facilities and domestic violence shelters saw no rise in sexual violence or public safety issues as a result.</p>

<p>Ms Truss said gender recognition reform is 'not the top priority for transgender people' and that their 'most important concern is the state of trans healthcare'.</p>

<p>'Trans people tell us that waiting lists at NHS gender clinics are too long.</p>

<p>'I agree, and I am deeply concerned at the distress it can cause.</p>

<p>'That is why we are opening at least three new gender clinics this year, which should see waiting lists cut by around 1,600 patients by 2022.</p>

<p>'The full benefit of the increases in clinical capacity that we've been able to secure will lead to greater patient choice, shorter waiting times, better geographical coverage and easier access.</p>

<p>'It will also make it easier to fulfil the medical requirements of obtaining a GRC.</p>

<p>'It is why we last year provided funding for the UK's first national LGBT health adviser to help improve transgender people's experience.' </p>
