<p>'I think she's got a rose because they do have a really good connection. I think she's very good at manipulating and making herself come across as a victim,' Bella said. </p>

<p>'It just sucks because both of my last relationships have been ruined because there was a girl that's come in that's manipulated it. And she's doing exactly that,' she told the other women. </p>

<p>An insider later claimed Bella had been under the impression that she was the only woman having 'lengthy' phone and SMS chats with Locky during self-isolation, when he was in fact having similar contact with several girls. </p>

<p>'The real reason they fell out was that Bella couldn't accept the fact that Irena had also formed a close connection with Locky during lockdown,' they said.</p>

<p>'She was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close.'</p>
