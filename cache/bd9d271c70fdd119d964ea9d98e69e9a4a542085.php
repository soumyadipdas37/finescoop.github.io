<p>Larson has a role in the second episode, which puts viewers in the perspective of a woman being sexually harassed. </p>

<p>'What we’re talking about is trying to put someone in someone else’s shoes,' Larson said in the interview.</p>

<p>'One place this really excels is dealing with power imbalance, because it’s an experience that’s very hard to have if your body limits you and you’ve never been in that experience before,' she added. </p>

<p>Someone else's shoes: 'What we’re talking about is trying to put someone in someone else’s shoes,' Larson said in the interview</p>

<p>She said that they started speaking with a bunch of women in the restaurant industry and 'started collecting a bunch of stories.'</p>

<p>'It's important, I think, to say that this project is their true stories, so when you're going inside these experiences, we're not fictionalizing it. We're just telling the truth and letting you go in and feel it for yourself,' Larson added. </p>

<p>Allan-Blitz revealed that less than a week after the election of Donald Trump, he spoke with Jones about doing something with VR technology.</p>

<p>'We need to see if we can use the power of this technology to actually, instead of dividing us like we've seen over the past four years, to bring us together,' Allan-Blitz said.</p>

<p>'This is a social experiment. We’re trying to see if we can use this new medium of VR to actually put you in the shoes of someone else, where you look down and you’re fully embodied in these different experiences, and to really see if this can be the ultimate empathy machine,' he added.</p>

<p>Larson added that one of the first conversations she had with Allan-Blitz was about empathy, and when he mentioned this project, she was 'in the midst of working with Times Up.'</p>

<p>“There are infinite stories to tell.” Larson said. “As many people as there are on the planet, everybody has a story, everybody has a moment that should be shared and experienced. And so we’re excited to collect more and do more.” </p>
