<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boris Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator will hold emergency talks with his EU counterpart today amid warnings that there is just a month left to strike a deal.</p>

<p>EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will travel to London for the unscheduled talks with David Frost in a bid to break the deadlock.</p>

<p>The ‘informal’ discussions are expected to focus on state aid rules and fishing rights, the two issues that have emerged as the biggest barriers to a deal. </p>

<p>Formal negotiations will resume next week.</p>

<p>A Whitehall source said that although the UK’s transition period from the EU is not due to finish until the end of the year, there is ‘realistically only a month’ to agree a deal in time for it to be ratified.</p>

<p>Both sides have become increasingly gloomy about the prospects for a deal in recent weeks after hopes of a summer breakthrough faded.</p>

<p>France yesterday accused Britain of deliberately stalling post-Brexit trade deal negotiations and having unreasonable expectations.</p>

<p>Speaking to his nation’s ambassadors, French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said: ‘Negotiations are not advancing because of the intransigent and unrealistic attitude of the United Kingdom.’ </p>

<p>But British sources said the deadlock was due to the EU’s intransigence.</p>

<p>‘They don’t seem to be prepared to move on any of the big things,’ one said.</p>

<p>Talks are currently stalled over fishing rights and state aid rules. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister has said that from the end of this year, the UK will determine access for foreign trawlers in British waters, in common with other independent coastal states.</p>

<p>But the EU is demanding that its fishing fleet continues to enjoy its existing access rights indefinitely. </p>

<p>Brussels is also demanding to know details of the UK’s state aid regime – the rules on bailouts of struggling companies and sectors – before moving on to other areas of negotiation.</p>

<p>The EU wants guarantees that the UK will not undercut its own industries.</p>

<p>But British ministers insist that as an independent country, the UK should be free to set its own industrial policy.</p>

<p>Mr Le Drian insisted yesterday the bloc of 27 will not buckle under pressure from London, adding: ‘On Brexit we always showed unity and proved wrong those who saw signs of an overall implosion of Europe. </p>

<p>'It is in staying united that we can stick to our line of a global accord.’</p>

<p>But UK ministers are also confident Mr Johnson will not back down, raising the prospect of leaving without a trade deal at the end of this year unless negotiators can achieve a sudden breakthrough.</p>
