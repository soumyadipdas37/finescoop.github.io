<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British student has discovered that one of America's most celebrated artists copied many of his earlier works from other paintings.</p>

<p>Louis Shadwick, researching a doctorate on Edward Hopper at the Courtauld Institute in London, found the great realist painter's works were strikingly similar to others.</p>

<p>His discovery is leading to a reassessment of the celebrated artist who died aged 84 in 1967 and whose painting Nighthawks is one of the most famous artworks in America.</p>

<p>A British student has discovered that one of America's most celebrated artists copied many of his earlier works. Pictured is Edward Hopper's Ships from 1898</p>

<p>Hopper's early oil painting appears to be a direct replica of a painting by Edward Moran, A Marine, created more than a decade earlier</p>

<p>Mr Shadwick, 30, has so far discovered four of Hopper's early oil paintings from the 1890s are reproductions of pre-existing works.</p>

<p>Two are copies of paintings from a magazine for amateur artists published in the years before Hopper's paintings, Mr Shadwick found.</p>

<p>The magazine even came with detailed instructions for how to copy the images, according to The New York Times.</p>

<p>Hopper, who is recognized among Jackson Pollock and Andy Warhol among one of the most influential artists of the 20th century, famously said: 'The only real influence I've ever had was myself.'</p>

<p>The artist from New York painted Church and Landscape (pictured) in 1897 which was believed until now to be a complete original</p>

<p>But Louis Shadwick, a student at the Courtauld Institute of art in London, discovered a previous artwork (pictured), a Victorian painted porcelain plaque, which itself was based on an earlier painting</p>

<p>This summer, Mr Shadwick was investigating what impact Tonalist painter Bruce Crane might have had on Hopper's early works.</p>

<p>Then, in what he describes as his 'eureka moment', the student found an image of Crane's A Winter Sunset on Google from 1890, which was an almost perfect match for Hopper's Old Ice Pond at Nyack, dated around 1897.</p>

<p>The paintings are similarly constructed featuring a winter landscape and a bright streak of light behind a house.</p>

<p>Hopper's painting is currently for sale at a gallery with a price estimate of $375,000 but the new evidence could affect its value to potential buyers.</p>

<p>The realist painter's work Nighthawks (pictured) is one of the most famous artworks in America</p>

<p>Hopper's most expensive painting, Chop Suey, was sold in 2018 for $91.9million</p>

<p>Scholars previously believed Hopper's early oil paintings showed his childhood home in Nyack, New York, and the self-trained painter's precocious skills.</p>

<p>But Mr Shadwick said: 'Both these things are not true — none of the oils are of Nyack, and Hopper had a middling talent for oil painting, until he went to art school.'</p>

<p>The PhD student also found that the earliest known Hopper oil painting, Rowboat in a Rocky Cove from 1895, is a replica of a watercolor by an unknown artist published in the Art Interchange in 1891.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hopper's Ships from 1898 was a copy of Edward Moran's A Marine from more than a decade earlier, and his Church and Landscape from 1897 was a replica of a Victorian painted porcelain plaque, which itself was based on an earlier painting.</p>

<p>Mr Shadwick has so far discovered four of Hopper's early oil paintings from the 1890s are reproductions of pre-existing works. Pictured: Lighthouse at Two Lights by Hopper, 1929</p>

<p>While many painters start off by copying existing works, experts say the discoveries undermine the idea of Hopper being a painting prodigy producing innovative art.</p>

<p>Kim Conaty, curator of drawings and prints at the Whitney Museum in New York, said: 'It cuts straight through the widely held perception of Hopper as an American original.'</p>

<p>Mr Shadwick said there was no shame in the copying and Hopper had not intended the paintings to be sold or made public. </p>
