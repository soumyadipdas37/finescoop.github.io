<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anthony Joshua's team have come out fighting after the heavyweight superstar was linked to the wife of Manchester City winger Riyad Mahrez.</p>

<p>Joshua, 30, has reportedly been spotted out and about with 26-year-old Rita, who has two children with Mahrez but is now separated from the footballer.</p>

<p>Reports in the Sun stated that Joshua had been 'been spotted on nights out with Rita', both in public and at the luxury pad of a mutual friend.</p>

<p>Anthony Joshua hit back at reports he has been seen spending time with Riyad Mahrez's wife</p>

<p>Rita Mahrez, 26, is said to have met Joshua during a night out at an exclusive London nightclub</p>

<p>Now, addressing the topic, a spokesman for Joshua has vehemently denied the accusation.</p>

<p>'Anthony doesn't personally know Mrs Mahrez and has no wish to, now or in future,' AJ's spokesman told the Sun.</p>

<p>'He's disappointed that she or people around her have tried to use his name to generate publicity.'</p>

<p>Joshua is single after his split from dancer Nicole Osbourne in 2016, who he has a young son with. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old model and singer is said to have been with Joshua at London's Tape night club</p>

<p>Joshua is alleged to have first met Rita in London's high-end Tape nightclub in December but is reported to have 'backed away' from the situation upon learning she was still married to City star Mahrez.</p>

<p>Mahrez, 29, married Rita in a private ceremony with only close family and friends back in August 2015 after the couple had dated for around five months. </p>

<p>The couple are since said to be estranged, and have minimal contact with each other.</p>

<p>They left their Cheshire mansion after trying to salvage their four-year marriage. </p>

<p>Rita, now single, is said to be living in a £2million mansion in Buckinghamshire. </p>

<p>A club-goer told The Sun in December: 'Rita bumped into AJ on her way out and he invited her to join him at his table in VIP.</p>

<p>Riyad and Rita with their daughter Inaya in 2016. The couple are reportedly now living apart</p>

<p>'Rita, who was with a female pal, clearly thought AJ was incredibly hot. They then spent much of the evening laughing and flirting.'</p>

<p>The source added that he didn't have a clue who she was but thought she was a pretty girl.</p>

<p>Joshua is the second boxer that Rita has been linked to, with reports emerging earlier this year of the American boxer Deontay Wilder flirting with her at a club in Manchester.</p>
