<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mayor of Budapest Gergely Karácsony has warned against UEFA's decision to allow fans into the stadium for the Super Cup final between Bayern Munich and Sevilla.</p>

<p>The final, played between the winner of last season's Champions League and Europa League, is to be held at the Puskas Arena in Hungary's capital. </p>

<p>Whilst UEFA hoped that the ceremonious final would open the gateway for the return of fans for the upcoming season, their plan is now under threat with the rising cases of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Mayor of Budapest Gergely Karácsony has warned against UEFA allowing fans at Super Cup</p>

<p>There will be around 30 per cent of Puskas Arena's 67,000 filled for the UEFA Super Cup </p>

<p>Hungary has seen a huge rise in covid-19, with an average of 800 cases per day which is a big leap from the 20 or 30 cases a day they were recording less than a month ago. Coronavirus cases are now more than 50 per 100,000 people.</p>

<p>And the mayor has made it clear that whilst he can't change the decision, he is not happy with fans attending the Super Cup final this Thursday. </p>

<p>'If I had the legal authority to make the decision, the match would be played behind closed doors,' he told daily newspaper Nepszava.</p>

<p>'But I don't have the right, so the responsibility belongs to those that do.' </p>

<p>Coronavirus cases In Hungary have risen to more than 50 per 100,000 people</p>

<p>Germany have seen a slight incline in coronavirus cases as they recorded 1,800 positive tests on Tuesday, 48 hours before the final. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, which has been one of the hotspots for the virus in Europe has taken a serious turn for the worse and last week they were recording between 10,000 and 15,000 cases per day.</p>

<p>The decision on playing with spectators present comes down to the Hungarian national government, headed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a huge football fan keen to promote the country as a stable environment for the match.</p>

<p>800 of the 2,100 Bayern fans have returned their tickets over fears of catching the killer virus</p>

<p>Bayern sold 2,100 tickets out of a possible 3,000 and offered free coronavirus testing at the Allianz Arena for any travelling fans. However, 800 of the Bayern faithful have since returned their tickets over fears of catching the killer virus.</p>

<p>Sevilla sold only around 500 of their allocation with even more of their fans unwilling to take the risk for the one-off final.</p>

<p>Therefore, most of the crowd of up to 20,000 — 30% of the stadium's capacity — will be made up of Hungarian locals. </p>

<p>Once the travelling fans arrive in Budapest, they must present their negative test result in order to enter.</p>
