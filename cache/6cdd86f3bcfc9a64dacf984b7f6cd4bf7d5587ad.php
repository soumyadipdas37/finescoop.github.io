<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lindy Chamberlain has spoken of the crushing isolation she experienced behind bars after being wrongly convicted of killing her baby daughter Azaria - and the emotional letter she wrote in jail detailing the injustice.</p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain, now 72, was sentenced to life in prison in 1982 for killing her daughter - only to be released four years later - after a dingo dragged the nine-week-old from a tent near Uluru in the Northern Territory on August 17, 1980.</p>

<p>The discovery of Azaria's yellow matinee jacket near a dingo den was the key piece of evidence leading to her freedom. </p>

<p>During her time languishing in jail the mother wrote an impassioned letter denying she had taken the life of her 'beloved daughter'.</p>

<p>Lindy Chamberlain famously lost her nine-week-old daughter Azaria (pictured together) to a dingo in Uluru, in the Northern Territory, on August 17, 1980</p>

<p>While in jail wrongly convicted of her daughter's killing, the mother wrote an impassioned letter rightly denying she had taken the life of her 'beloved daughter'</p>

<p>'I’ve tried to co-operate, but still this farce continues,' she wrote. 'For nearly three years, I have worked as an inmate of this prison for 30 cents a day, trying to do whatever I was asked pleasantly.</p>

<p>'I have sought an inquiry whereby the NT Government had a chance to redeem their own name. In return, they have ignored decency and justice and still scoff at it.</p>

<p>'As from 1pm Darwin time today, I’m refusing to work in any way whatsoever for this prison. I did not kill my beloved daughter and refuse to be treated as a criminal any longer.'</p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain said her time behind bars was so isolating when journalist Ita Buttrose went to her prison to interview her she considered the meeting a 'treat'.</p>

<p>A two-part documentary titled 'Lindy Chamberlain: The True Story' also revealed then-Northern Territory Attorney-General Marshall Perron admitted he did not want it to look like he was releasing her because of public pressure.</p>

<p>'I think he was feeling, himself, probably something needed to be done,' former Attorney-General Gareth Evans - who was advising Mr Perron - said.</p>

<p>'But as he made it very directly clear to me, he did not want to be seen to be succumbing to pressure.'  </p>

<p>Chamberlain was wrongfully sentenced to life imprisonment for murder in 1982 and said her time in jail taught her to develop patience. Pictured in a new two-part documentary entitled 'Lindy Chamberlain: The True Story'</p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain also said a 'black baby dress' (pictured above) convinced Australians she was a 'witch'. She made the dress for her son</p>

<p>Narrated by Sam Neill, the Network Ten documentary draws on interviews with eyewitnesses, high profile media identities, high court judges and family friends. </p>

<p>It also shows the impact of the case on Ms Chamberlain's other children, Aidan, 46, Reagan, 44, and Kahlia, 37. </p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain famously screamed 'a dingo's got my baby!' to her fellow campers after Azaria was dragged from the tent.  </p>

<p>Previously unheard recordings showed Ms Chamberlain discussing the black baby dress decorated with red ribbons with her mother. </p>

<p>'In this tape, recorded years before Azaria was born, I talk about how I'd made the black dress for Reagan and how much I liked it and how much Michael hated it,' she said.      </p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain's ex-husband Michael Chamberlain (pictured together) was also wrongly convicted of an accessory to murder charge after Azaria's disappearance </p>

<p>Lindy Chamberlain was a 32-year-old mother of three (she is pictured with husband Michael and sons Reagan and Aidan) when she returned to the family tent to find an empty bassinet </p>

<p>A royal commission exonerated her of murder in 1988. Lindy Chamberlain is pictured during the late 1980s with her eldest son Aiden, second son Reagan, daughter Kahlia who was born as her mother served a life sentence and husband Michael</p>

<p>She said her biggest regret was not the three years she spent in prison but the way her case affected others who were involved. </p>

<p>Some witnesses were not believed by the police force and legal system and felt traumatised by the process. </p>

<p>'It makes me sad that they feel responsible that I went into prison,' she said.  </p>

<p>The family were acquitted of responsibility after a fourth coroner's inquest in 2012 which found that Azaria died 'as a result of being attacked and taken by a dingo'.  </p>

<p>Azaria Chantel Loren Chamberlain was born June 11, 1980.</p>

<p>She was taken by a dingo while her parents Lindy and Michael slept on August 17, 1980, at a camping site by Uluru. </p>

<p>An initial inquest in Alice Springs supported the parents' claim a dingo stole Azaria. A further investigation and 1981 inquest was then held in Darwin.  </p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain was accused of killing her child and jailed for life in a 1982 murder trial. Mr Chamberlain was also sentenced as an accessory.   </p>

<p>The Chamberlains made several unsuccessful appeals and Ms Chamberlain spent more than three years behind bars.</p>

<p>She was not exonerated until a piece of Azaria's clothing was found near a dingo lair in 1986. </p>

<p>Ms Chamberlain was released from jail and received $1.3 million in compensation over her false imprisonment.</p>

<p>An amended death certificate was issued and all convictions against Lindy and Michael Chamberlain were overturned in 1988.</p>

<p>A third inquest in 1995 did not determine a cause of death and was left 'open'.</p>

<p>A fourth coronial inquest in 2012 finally ruled that a dingo had killed Azaria, not her mother.</p>

<p>Azaria's body was never found and the scrap of clothing that cleared her mother was the only sign of her.</p>

<p>The case remains one of the most famous in Australian history and is the subject of numerous books, films, and documentaries. </p>
