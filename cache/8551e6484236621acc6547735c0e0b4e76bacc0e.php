<p>Nicole Green, 35, died instantly when her Mitsubishi Mirage crashed head on into a black BMW sedan about 7.15am last Thursday, August 28</p>

<p>In the wake of the tragedy friends and family paid tribute to Ms Green who had faced a tough few years personally with a number of run-ins with the law and was due to face a trial later in 2020 for charges of stealing a $3,000 handbag</p>

<p>Police believe Ms Green's car veered onto the wrong side of the road in the moments prior to the collision. Two passengers in the car with her - men both in their 20s - were taken to hospital</p>

<p>Ms Green was due to face trial in late 2020 for trying to steal a $3000 Louis Vuitton bag in 2018.</p>

<p>The Daily Telegraph reported she was accused of attempting to snatch the bag from its 62-year-old owner near Wollongong.</p>

<p>Ms Green also recently pleaded guilty to helping another man rob a car owned by a university student.  </p>

<p>She zapped the car owner with a taser prior to the December 2018 robbery.</p>

<p>Despite her checkered history friends remembered Ms Green as an 'angel'.</p>

<p>'Nic Green another angle taken from us way too soon, may you fly high in heaven you beautiful angel,' her friend Bronwyn Robinson posted on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I'll treasure every single memory we got to share together always in our hears. Gone but never forgotten.' </p>

<p>Two passengers - both reportedly aged in their 20s - who were in Ms Green's car at the time of the crash were taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital for urgent treatment.</p>

<p>Emergency crews swarmed the Sydney Harbour Bridge after the fatal crash during peak hour last Thursday, August 28</p>

<p>A helicopter landed on the bridge to to assist with transporting injured passengers to hospital</p>

<p>The wrecked BMW (pictured), which had its roof completely torn off, was later taken away on a truck after police had finished investigating the crash scene </p>

<p>The driver of the BMW, a woman in her 40s, was cut out of her car after she was trapped for two hours.</p>

<p>She was taken to hospital with a fractured leg and spinal injuries. Her passenger, 40, escaped virtually unscathed. </p>

<p>Acting Superintendent Paul Dunstan said he has watched 'confronting' CCTV vision of the crash, which is currently being reviewed by investigators and has not been released.</p>

<p>'It would appear at this stage that the vehicle travelling in the northbound direction has crossed two lanes of traffic and collided with the vehicle travelling south which was in its correct lane,' Mr Dunstan said.</p>

<p>'I have seen footage of the incident, and that's how it appears in the early stages.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for NSW Ambulance revealed first responders were confronted with a devastating scenario when they arrived at the crash.</p>

<p>They split into separate rescue teams to work on survivors in each car.</p>

<p>The crash sparked chaos during the morning commute with hundreds of cars backed-up along the bridge</p>

<p>One woman died and another had to fight for her life after a red Mitsubishi Mirage (pictured left) travelling north crashed head on into a BMW travelling south on the Harbour Bridge at 7:15am on Thursday </p>

<p>Fire crews and paramedics surround a car involved in a fatal crash in Sydney on Thursday, a woman in her 40s was trapped inside for up to two hours</p>

<p>A witness, who had been on a bus heading into the city at the time, described the scene as 'chaotic' as footage showed dozens of rescuers trying to free the trapped motorist.</p>

<p>She said it looked as though the black BMW had been 'completely destroyed'.</p>

<p>'I saw the whole roof of the black car had been sliced off, there were still people in the car, it looked they were trying to get them out,' she told Daily Mail Australia</p>

<p>'There was also a stretcher on the side of the road and there was a blanket over someone.' </p>

<p>Initial reports suggest speed may have been a factor in the crash.</p>

<p>Traffic was brought to a standstill for several hours, meaning firefighters from nearby The Rocks fire station had to make their way to the scene on foot.</p>
