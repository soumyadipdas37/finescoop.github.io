<p>Reunion talk: It comes after actress Jennifer Aniston (second left), who played Rachel Green in Friends, revealed the hotly-anticipated reunion had been delayed again until May next year</p>

<p>She told Deadline last month that she was optimistic about the reboot, however, saying she was a 'glass half-full' person. </p>

<p>'It's going to be super. You know what? This [delay] has given us more time to make it even more exciting and more fun than it would have been,' she said.</p>

<p>'I choose to see it as the glass is half-full that it got postponed. Look, we're not going anywhere. You're never going to get rid of Friends. You're stuck with us for life, guys.'</p>

<p>The reunion has been plagued with delays and HBO Max has now pushed the special back again due to the coronavirus pandemic, which is now surging in California. </p>

<p>Filming won't take place until next May 'at the earliest', according to sources who spoke with Variety about the project.</p>

<p>The Friends reunion will be very different from the sitcom fans remember, and will instead be an 'unscripted special'. </p>
