<p>'Best books ever': Ed tweeted about his love for the Pulllman trilogy back in 2015</p>

<p>It's been claimed that the name was inspired by the main character in Ed's favourite book series, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials. </p>

<p>Lyra Belacqua, also known as Lyra Silvertongue, is the heroine of Pullman's trilogy.  </p>

<p>Lyra is a young girl who inhabits a parallel universe and finds herself embroiled in a cosmic war between Lord Asriel on the one side, and the first angel to come into being, called The Authority, and his Regent, called Metatron, on the other. </p>

<p>In 2015, Ed tweeted: '[By] far, Philip Pullman - his dark materials are the best books I've ever read.'</p>

<p>The couple have been together for five years, with Ed confirming last summer that he and Cherry, 28, tied the knot in a private ceremony in January 2019. </p>

<p>Singer Ed first revealed Cherry was his wife in an interview with Charlamagne The God to promote his album No.6 Collaborations Project.</p>

<p>After Charlamagne The God asked about lyrics on the album which refer to the singer's 'wife', Ed admitted that he wrote the words before the couple tied the knot, but he 'knew that we'd be married' by the point that the song came out. </p>

<p>The Grammy winner and Cherry wed in a ceremony that saw just 40 close friends and family in attendance, according to a report in The Sun.  </p>

<p>Popped the question: Ed announced his engagement to Cherry, 26, in January 2018 with a candid Instagram snap</p>

<p>Ed announced his engagement to Cherry in January 2018 with a candid Instagram snap, gushing to fans: 'Got myself a fiancée just before new year. We are very happy and in love, and our cats are chuffed as well xx'</p>

<p>The couple are thought to have started dating in 2015, with Ed's best pal Taylor Swift sharing a photo of the pair kissing on her Instagram account.</p>

<p>Ed and Cherry first met as children when they both attended Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham, Suffolk. </p>

<p>But Cherry moved to the US for university, meaning the friends lost touch. After working on Wall Street, she moved back to the UK in 2016 to be with Ed.  </p>
