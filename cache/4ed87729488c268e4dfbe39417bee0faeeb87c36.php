<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>John Edwards, 67, killed his children Jack, 15, and Jennifer, 13, before turning the gun on himself</p>

<p>A policewoman who took an assault report from a mother whose estranged husband later shot dead their two children had never read the force's standard operating procedures on domestic violence.</p>

<p>Senior Constable Brooke Cooper had been teaching children traffic safety for nine years when Olag Edwards made a complaint about her husband at Hornsby police station in December 2016.</p>

<p>She had only been working in general duties on the front counter that day because it was school holidays.</p>

<p>Olga had reported her husband John Edwards had assaulted their children Jack and Jennifer three times the previous year.</p>

<p>She alleged Edwards had hit and kicked Jack in October 2015 when he was playing with his father's iPod and hit him on another occasion when he was playing with a stack of CDs.</p>

<p>Olga also claimed Edwards had slapped Jennifer in the face when she would not go to sleep.</p>

<p>Senior Constable Cooper accepted each of those incidents could constitute an assault but she had recorded Olga's report as 'no offence detected'.</p>

<p>Jack (pictured left) and Jennifer's (pictured right) body were found under his bedroom desk with multiple gunshot wounds </p>

<p>With hindsight, the allegation should have been classified as 'assault - domestic violence related', she said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Senior Constable Cooper conceded she was unfamiliar with some of the processes reporting domestic violence allegations.</p>

<p>'I've been so out of the loop with general duties practices,' she said.</p>

<p>Edwards, 67, shot dead Jack, 15, and Jennifer, 13, at West Pennant Hills on July 5, 2018, before killing himself.</p>

<p>Six months after the children's murders their 36-year-old mother took her own life.</p>

<p>An inquest is being held into all four deaths at at the New South Wales Coroner's Court sitting at Lidcombe.</p>

<p>Their devastated mother Olga took her own life six months after the tragic murder suicide </p>

<p>Under questioning by counsel assisting the coroner, Christopher Maxwell, Senior Constable Cooper said she had never read the police standard operating procedures for dealing with domestic violence complaints.</p>

<p>Asked if she was familiar with the document, which was avaliable on the police intranet, she said, 'Not really'.</p>

<p>'I knew there would have been a policy somewhere there,' she said.</p>

<p>'There's standard operating procedures for just about anything.'</p>

<p>Olga had separated from Edwards in March 2016, taking the children with her.</p>

<p>In December that year she had told Senior Constable Cooper that her children did not want to be with their father 'and this makes him angry'.</p>

<p>Senior Constable Cooper said she was aware the most dangerous time for domestic violence victims was after an assault had been disclosed to police.</p>

<p>She was also aware a victim leaving the marital home should be considered as a relevant factor when assessing the risk of future violence.</p>

<p>Senior Constable Cooper, who had been police officer for 18 years, said she had not spoken to Edwards or the children after Olga made her report.</p>

<p>'I did ask her to bring thchildren in,' she said.</p>

<p>Edwards, 67, turned the gun on himself at a rented home near Normanhurst, northern Sydney (pictured) </p>

<p>Senior Constable Cooper also said she had not read old reports of domestic violence by Edwards against former partners on the police computer system.</p>

<p>The inquest has previously heard the financial planner had slapped Jennifer in the street while the family were on holiday in Paris.</p>

<p>He then chased Jack down an alleyway and hit him so aggressively that members of the public were forced to intervene.</p>

<p>Olga had commennced custody proceedings in in the Family Court in April 2016.</p>

<p>She described the violence inflicted upon her children in an affidavit, revealing Jack slept with a cricket bat in his room to defend himself and his sister against their father.</p>

<p>David Brown, a principal at the law firm where Olga worked as a solicitor, has told the inquest she was 'very, very bright'.</p>

<p>Olga had shared details of her deteriorating marriage with Mr Brown and expressed concerns her violent husband was turning his behaviour towards their children.</p>

<p>When describing Edwards, Mr Brown said: 'He was something of a bully ... He was a man who burst into tempers and I think he drank a lot.'</p>

<p>Olga had been sleeping in a separate room with the children following 'serious physical abuse' against Jack.</p>

<p>Mr Brown detailed one instance Olga told him about where Edwards and Jack had a confrontation that resulted in the father pushing his son to the ground and kicking him.</p>

<p>'There were so many instances ... where the father had altercations with his son because the son had shown no respect for his father, with good reason I should say,' Mr Brown said.</p>

<p>Despite Olga detailing the scope of Edwards' violent behaviour towards his children, he was still allowed to see them as part of a limited contact order by the court.</p>

<p>In her affidavit, she said she had 'a tremendous fear I would come home and find my child dead because John could never control his temper'.</p>

<p>Edwards had ten children to seven partners.</p>

<p>The inquest heard on Monday heard Edwards was awarded licences to own rifles and pistols in June 2017.</p>

<p>The licence was granted after NSW Firearms Registry staff used a police database report that failed to pick up several matters related to domestic violence. The inquest also heard the registry didn't know Ku-Ring-Gai Pistol Club refused Edwards membership in early 2017.</p>

<p>Jack, 15, and Jennifer Edwards, 13, were found 'crumpled together' under Jack's desk after Edwards stormed the West Pennant Hills house (pictured)</p>

<p>Over the next year, Edwards legally acquired five weapons including the Glock 17A 9mm semi-automatic pistol he used to shoot dead Jennifer and Jack in the boy's bedroom.</p>

<p>Edwards hired a car and stalked his daughter on her way home from school to learn their new address before he followed or chased his daughter inside.</p>

<p>Neighbour Bruce Wilson heard five shots over about a minute and approached the home, knowing 'someone is shooting the children'.</p>

<p>He eye-balled Edwards as the 68-year-old 'half skipped' down the home's front stairs.</p>

<p>'I said "is everything OK, what have you done?",' Mr Wilson told the inquest.</p>

<p>'He didn't say anything, he just walked towards me.</p>

<p>'He was in no hurry, he didn't rush at all. Everything was methodical and well-thought-out.'</p>

<p>The children were later found 'crumpled together' under Jack's bedroom desk with multiple gunshot wounds. Edwards killed himself at his Normanhurst home the night of the murders.</p>
