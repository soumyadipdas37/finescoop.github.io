<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A violently overprotective father has been jailed for seven years for taking a shotgun to confront a fellow parent and firing bullets into the air after a playground bust-up between their children. </p>

<p>John Fleck, 31, turned up at the home of his neighbour William Robertson shouting: 'You're getting it, your missus is getting it, and your kids are getting it.'</p>

<p>He then pointed the shotgun at Mr Robertson before blasting it in the air 'several times' as the victim and his family cowered on their doorstep.</p>

<p>John Fleck, 31, (pictured in a mugshot) turned up at the home of his neighbour William Robertson shouting: 'You're getting it, your missus is getting it, and your kids are getting it'</p>

<p>Mr Robertson and his wife Dorothy, who live just 100 yards away from Fleck, said they were left fearing for their lives following the shooting in Miles Platting, Manchester.</p>

<p>'He threatened my life and the lives of my wife and children,' Mr Robertson said. 'No one has the right to pull a firearm on me and put me in fear.</p>

<p>'I am angry about what happened and feel more worried than I did immediately after the incident.</p>

<p>'He came to the front door shouting threats while armed with a shotgun and threatened me several times. He fired it several times. This was not minor behaviour.’</p>

<p>Mrs Robertson said: 'I was happy in the area and had lived there for 20 years but I am now worried about what people are saying and speaking about in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>‘He issued threats to my children and has really worried me.'</p>

<p>Fleck was jailed for seven years at Manchester Crown Court after he was found guilty by a jury of possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence.</p>

<p>The court heard he had flown into a rage on March 13 this year after learning of an argument between his child and one of Mr Robertson's children which broke out for undisclosed reasons.</p>

<p>After drinking heavily he put a bandana over his face in an attempt to disguise himself before taking the one minute walk for the 11.55pm hit on Mr Robertson and his family.</p>

<p>During the attack was seen bending down and picking up cartridges from the ground to reload the gun before firing again.</p>

<p>Mr Robertson told the court: 'My daughter came into our room and she was shouting: “Fleck's got a gun and he's shooting at the house”.</p>

<p>'I looked out of our living room window. I saw Fleck outside shooting. He was on the right in the middle of the road....he had a shotgun in his hand. He was standing there with the gun.</p>

<p>‘I went out straight away. He was saying: “Come on, come on”. He was saying: “Come on you black b*****d, you're getting it, your missus is getting it and your kids are getting it”.</p>

<p>'He was bending down and picking the shells and cartridges up. At one point he aimed at me then fired into the air.</p>

<p>‘One shot was fired into the air, one was fired into the street.’</p>

<p>Mr Robertson and his wife Dorothy, (pictured) who live just 100 yards away from Fleck, said they were left fearing for their lives following the shooting in Miles Platting, Manchester</p>

<p>At this point Dorothy Robertson was at the door with the children.</p>

<p>‘Everyone was just shouting and the kids were crying,’ Mr Robertson continued. ‘I told them to get in the house in case he fired at them. He fired about four or five shots.</p>

<p>'He was still on the road and facing towards me. He was backing away.</p>

<p>'I was still fearful for my life. I was angry and I was frightened. I was afraid for their lives as well.'</p>

<p>Fleck was arrested later but denied wrongdoing. His lawyer Ian McMeekin said: 'He is not a dangerous offender.</p>

<p>The cartridges discharged were non-lethal and scientists who attended the scene confirmed there was no danger to life.</p>

<p>The preparation for this offence must have been over a fairly short period and the defendant did not 'lie low' for long after the attack.</p>

<p>'He is a family man and this was a crude example of an act of violence on the street designed to cause fear by a man who was intoxicated.'</p>

<p>Sentencing Judge Hillary Manley told Fleck: 'Your actions were utterly stupid and incredibly dangerous.</p>

<p>‘You were heavily under the influence of drink or drugs and your victims feared they would be shot. Children were present.</p>

<p>'You caused real fear to your victims, for themselves and for their children. This was a real shotgun with real shotgun cartridges.</p>

<p>‘There was no lawful purpose for such a weapon being used.’</p>

<p>Fleck was handed a restraining order banning him from contacting the victims for life.</p>
