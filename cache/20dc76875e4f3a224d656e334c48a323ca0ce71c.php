<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fulham are on the verge of confirming the loan signing of Ademola Lookman from RB Leipzig.</p>

<p>Lookman will join the Cottagers on an initial loan deal for a fee of around £2million in a switch that is set to be wrapped up in the next 24 hours.</p>

<p>The move will see Lookman return to the Premier League following his £22.5m move to Germany from Everton last summer.</p>

<p>Fulham are close to the season-long loan of ex-Everton winger Ademola Lookman (left)</p>

<p>The Bundesliga side snapped up the 22 year-old, who started his career at Charlton, after a previous successful loan spell at Leipzig.</p>

<p>But his second stint has not gone to plan with Lookman starting just once in the league last season.</p>

<p>Fulham have lost all three of their league games this season since their return to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Alphonse Areola arrived this summer on a season-long loan</p>

<p>Mario Lemina also joined the club on a temporary deal leaving Southampton in a loan move </p>

<p>They have strengthened their goalkeeping department with the addition of Alphonse Areola, their full-backs by bringing in Antonee Robinson, Kenny Tete and Ola Aina and in central midfield with Mario Lemina. Harrison Reed and Anthony Knockaert also had their loan moves made permanent.</p>

<p>And vice chairman Tony Khan confirmed they are determined to continue strengthening, particularly in defence, after their humbling 3-0 home defeat to Aston Villa on Monday.</p>

<p>He said: 'I apologize to Fulham supporters for our performance tonight. We've looked to add centre-backs since Wembley. </p>

<p>'I'm sorry we haven't yet as two got Covid and we lost a free we thought was close and had another issue with a fourth centre-back. </p>

<p>'I promise players in and better efforts from this squad.'</p>

<p>The 3-0 defeat at home to Aston Villa caused Tony Khan to issue an apology via social media</p>

<p>Khan continued to apologise and pledged that the playing squad would enhance their efforts</p>
