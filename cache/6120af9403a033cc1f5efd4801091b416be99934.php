<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>We think an early night is in order on arrival in St Lucia, what with the time difference. But within a couple of hours we’re dancing wildly in the street and all thoughts of sleep are banished.</p>

<p>Heading almost straight to the weekly Friday Night Jump Up street party, hosted by a small fishing town called Gros Islet, near the northern tip of the island, proves to be the perfect pick-me-up after our long flight.</p>

<p>Tourists begin arriving early in the evening, with queues quickly forming around the block for Duke’s Place, which serves an array of barbecued fish with rice, drenched in a delicious garlic, butter and onion sauce. You can then mosey up the street to browse the arts and crafts stalls and the many, many table-top bars selling rum cocktails in plastic cups. Which are more potent than they look.</p>

<p>Making a point: The island is perhaps best known for its striking twin volcanic peaks, the Pitons</p>

<p>St Lucians arrive a little later, which is when the party really gets started, with people of all ages dancing around huge speakers to a happy mix of reggae and pop classics.</p>

<p>St Lucia — which, thankfully, has not had a single death from Covid-19 — is nicknamed The Helen of the West Indies, for its beauty and because it was fought over so often by the French and English.</p>

<p>But it’s perhaps best known for its striking twin volcanic peaks, the Pitons, which tower over the island on its southern flank.</p>

<p>Our basecamp for the week is Cap Maison on the north coast, about seven miles from the capital, Castries, which is the main cruise port.</p>

<p>The island is only 27 miles long and 14 miles wide, but the winding, hilly roads mean it takes a couple of hours to reach the hotel by car from Hewanorra Airport in the south.</p>

<p>When we pass other cars, drivers beep their horn enthusiastically, which I assume is to avoid an accident on a blind bend. But we’re told it’s just the St Lucian way of saying a friendly hello.</p>

<p>And friendly they are. We’ve only been in the taxi a few minutes when our driver, Shane, asks if we’re hungry.</p>

<p>The Daily Mail's Victoria Bischoff checked into Cap Maison on St Lucia's north coast</p>

<p>Without waiting for an answer he pulls over at an evidently popular truck stop to treat us to what he proclaims is the best sandwich on the island and a tasty tropical juice.</p>

<p>Perched on a cliff overlooking its own secluded sandy beach, Smuggler’s Cove, Cap Maison resort is like a village in its own right.</p>

<p>There are whitewashed villas of all sizes set among gardens and courtyards.</p>

<p>Of the two main pools our favourite is a little two-tier number overlooking the sea and within arm’s reach of the Cliff at Cap, one of the hotel’s two restaurants.</p>

<p>A pre-dinner pina colada on its terrace quickly becomes a nightly tradition. As I overhear one American tourist declare, it is the best spot on the island to watch the sunset, with strings of fairy lights coming to life as the day fades away.</p>

<p>Cliff at Cap is also where breakfast is held — in sight of Pigeon Island.</p>

<p>Fort Rodney was built by the British in the 18th century and has amazing panoramic views</p>

<p>It turns out that this 44-acre national landmark is no longer actually an island, as it’s joined to the mainland by a man-made causeway.</p>

<p>One of its highlights is Fort Rodney, built by the British in the 18th century. It has amazing panoramic views. On a clear day you can see Martinique from the hill. Just take plenty of water.</p>

<p>For keen walkers, a morning rainforest hike at Babonneau comes highly recommended. Most visitors are seeking an adrenaline fix on the tree-top zip lines. But we opt for a three-hour nature walk where our laid-back guide, Jessie, teaches us bird calls, points out enormous stick insects on trees, shows us how to flip rocks to find scorpions and encourages us to eat termites — supposedly an excellent source of protein.</p>

<p>For a glimpse at what life used to be like, head to Lushan Country Life Nature Park. With a bamboo walking stick in hand, you’ll learn how to open a coconut and, most importantly, which plants keep the dreaded mosquitoes at bay (basil).</p>

<p>After all this exertion, you’ve earned a five-star dinner — and you don’t even need to leave the hotel.</p>

<p>Whether you opt for fine dining at Cliff at Cap or a more casual meal at the Naked Fisherman on the beachfront, you will be blown away. If in doubt always go for the fish — we gorged on mahi-mahi.</p>

<p>If you’ve got itchy feet, head to Rodney Bay marina. At Jacques Waterfront Dining we delighted in the genius of pairing seafood with roast potatoes.</p>

<p>Regrets? Well, we never managed to see the famous Pitons. But that’s no bad thing. We have a perfect excuse to return to this special island.</p>
