<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kylian Mbappe could cost just £91million next summer if he refuses to sign a contract extension with Paris Saint-Germain, according to reports. </p>

<p>The striker is in the final two years of his contract with the French champions who are desperate for him to pen a new long-term deal - but negotiations have not progressed.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old is valued at £400m, but according to AS that could drop to £111m if he enters the final year of his contract. And L'Equipe report that the fee could fall as low as £91m if PSG are unable to convince him to sign a new contract.</p>

<p>Kylian Mbappe could cost just £91m next summer if he refuses to sign a contract extension</p>

<p>Real Madrid could be a possible destination for Mbappe with LaLiga side interested in the star</p>

<p>But the French outlet also claim the price could increase by £35m if Mbappe agrees to a one-year extension.</p>

<p>The forward reportedly told PSG he wants to leave in 2021 with Real Madrid and Liverpool both interested in a possible move.</p>

<p>However, Covid-19 has had significant economic impact on the biggest European clubs and Real president Florentino Perez made it clear the LaLiga side would not be making any big signings any time soon.</p>

<p>The World Cup winner has reportedly told the French champions he wants to leave in 2021</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has also previously said it would be almost impossible financially to bring the World Cup winner to Anfield.</p>

<p>As reported by Sportsmail, Liverpool did make contact with the representative of Mbappe in the summer of 2017, when the then Monaco star was preparing to make his first big move on the European stage.</p>

<p>But his value has rocketed since and even a reduced fee of £91m would go against the Reds' transfer strategy.</p>

<p>Speaking in November 2019, Klopp said: '(Buying) this calibre of player is difficult. I don't see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG.</p>

<p>'I don't see any club, that is how it is. We are involved in the clubs that cannot do it - it is as easy as that.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has previously admitted it would be financially difficult to sign the Frenchman</p>

<p>'OK, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign him - what a player he is! It is about the money, of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance.' </p>

<p>A move to Real may be more realistic and is said to be Mbappe's preferred destination because of his admiration for manager Zinedine Zidane.</p>

<p>The Spanish club managed to reduce their costs by moving James Rodriguez to Everton and Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon to Tottenham. </p>

<p>But AS claim they are prepared to play the long game in order to bring Mbappe to the Bernabeu.  </p>
