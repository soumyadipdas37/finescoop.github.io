<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There are no fewer than 16 Caribbean islands still shining bright on the Government’s ‘good to go’ list — and while not all of them are currently accessible we can — hurrah! — still fly off to many of the great favourites such as Barbados, Antigua and St Lucia.</p>

<p>While the pandemic has inevitably made its mark — face masks, social distancing and temperature checks are the norm — the good news is the number of flights from the UK to this sunny region is set to increase dramatically in the coming months. Many hotels, from luxury hideaways to family-loving all-inclusives, are opening their doors, air fares are attractive, and the absence of cruise ships and hordes of tourists means island life is blissfully relaxed.</p>

<p>You’ll need to fill in some online forms and have proof of a negative Covid-19 test, but with so much of the world still off-limits, the chance to line up some winter warmth should not be missed. And when you’re bobbing around in that glistening turquoise sea, enjoying rainforest adventures and reggae beats under the stars, six months of semi-lockdown might not seem so bad.</p>

<p>ST LUCIA IS DIVINE </p>

<p>Winter sun: Most family-friendly package resorts in St Lucia are in the north around Rodney Bay while the small upmarket hotels gathered beside the dramatic twin peaks of the Pitons will suit loved-up couples</p>

<p>Served by flights with British Airways and TUI (from November 3), St Lucia’s winning mix of lush rainforest, pocket-sized beaches and an authentic Caribbean welcome guarantees a memorable sunshine break.</p>

<p>Most family-friendly package resorts are in the north around Rodney Bay while the small upmarket hotels gathered beside the dramatic twin peaks of the Pitons will suit loved-up couples.</p>

<p>GOOD TO KNOW: A negative Covid-19 test taken up to seven days before arrival is required. Car hire is not permitted but you can book a limited range of excursions including horseriding and rainforest walks (stlucia.org).</p>

<p>ACTIVE ANTIGUA</p>

<p>Spoilt for choice: Antigua is famous for its 365 beaches - one for each day of the year - offering white sand and turquoise waters</p>

<p>Choose Antigua if you love sailing, beach bar-hopping or have offspring who need exercising daily. The island trades on having 365 beaches and is a doddle to explore.</p>

<p>Some resorts are quite isolated so check the map before you book — English Harbour, home to super yachts and the World Heritage-listed Nelson’s Dockyard (the admiral lived there for three years) is the most inviting corner.</p>

<p>GOOD TO KNOW: Make sure you fly via Antigua rather than Paris to avoid having to quarantine on your return. Visitors must have a negative Covid-19 test taken 72 hours prior to arrival (uk.france.fr/en/holiday-prep).</p>
