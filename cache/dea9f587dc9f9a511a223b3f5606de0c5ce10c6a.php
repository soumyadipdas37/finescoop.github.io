<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police across Britain last night launched a crack down on illegal parties as revellers hit the town for boozy celebrations before the government's tough new 'rule of six' comes into force.</p>

<p>Officers broke up house parties in Altrincham, Stockport and Flixton, all in Greater Manchester, on Saturday night, while police in Nottingham tackled a 50 person gathering in Lenton.</p>

<p>In the largest gathering said to have been broken up by officers last night, a team from Greater Manchester Police dispersed around 70 party-goers from a house in Mottram.</p>

<p>The crackdown came as revellers up and down the country hit the streets for a last hurrah before the government's new rule limiting the number of people in gatherings to six comes into play on Monday.</p>

<p>With little sign of social distancing, large groups of drinkers gathered at bars and restaurants in London, Nottingham, Manchester, Portsmouth and Leeds last night and into the early hours of this morning to take advantage of their last few hours of freedom before the government tightens lockdown restrictions again. </p>

<p>In London's West End, hundreds of drinkers could be seen singing along and dancing as a busker played a tune, with very few revellers paying attention to the government's social distancing measures.  </p>

<p>Under Boris Johnson's strict new measures, groups of more than six can be broken up by police who will be able to hand out £100 fines to those who flout the rules.</p>

<p>This will double on each repeat offence up to £3,200 and only schools, workplaces and a limited number of other locations will be exempt.</p>

<p>The move, introduced to tackle the rising spread of coronavirus, comes as a Government-led study yesterday suggested the reproduction 'R' rate could be as high as 1.7 in England. </p>

<p>Tim Robson, the North East's representative on the national Pubwatch scheme, expected police officers would strictly monitor bars over the weekend to ensure they are operating safely.</p>

<p>He said: 'There is an anticipation that everyone is going to have a big last binge, but people are starting to get fearful and a lot of licensed premises have already been clamped down on by the police.'</p>

<p>Mr Robson, a former police officer, said it will be up to licensees to manage their premises and break up large groups from gathering together unsafely.</p>

<p>He added: 'There may be a rise in groups going out this weekend, but it will be probably to premises who don't have door supervision and control.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Newcastle upon Tyne's director of public health Eugene Milne has said he did not think large numbers of people would go out for a big binge ahead of the tighter controls coming in. </p>

<p>He told Tyne Tees TV News: 'At the opening of lockdown there was a real fear that that might happen in the city, and that didn't happen so I think we can trust people.</p>

<p>'The idea of the rule of six is to make it easier for people to know how to stick with the guidance and I think one of the big problems has been the guidance has progressively got so complicated, so specific to particular areas, that it becomes very confusing for everybody.'</p>

<p>Speaking to the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme, he said: 'We're not saying people shouldn't see their friends but there does need to be a degree of self-discipline, of restriction to deal with the challenges we are facing.'</p>

<p>A 19-year-old student, who threw house party for 50 people that saw him fined £10,000, has apologised after claiming he 'only' invited 25 people but things 'got out of hand'.</p>

<p>The teenage host had become 'hostile' when council community protection officers were called to the house in Harlaxton Drive in Lenton, Nottingham, at around 7pm on Friday.</p>

<p>Police were called a short time later and found around 50 people at the address, which is close to the university, who were all ordered to leave.</p>

<p>Officers claim the young man was given the chance to shut down Friday's party before he was issued with the hefty fine.</p>

<p>He has since apologised for his actions but refused to say whether he will pay or appeal the fine, or who will end up picking up the tab, if the appeal is unsuccessful.</p>

<p>The fine comes just days before new rules come in force whereby only six people can meet at any one time.</p>

<p>There are currently six students living at the property who did not wish to be identified.</p>

<p>But, speaking after the incident, one said: 'It was meant to be a small gathering with mates and it got out of hand.</p>

<p>'We had invited 25 people and it was out in the garden and aimed to end at 11pm and we were trying to social distance but then people invited their mates and so on.</p>

<p>'It got out of hand and we are really sorry.'</p>

<p>Police said if he fails to pay or contests the fine he will appear before a court. </p>

<p>'When you are exercising freedom, you should do so in a way that does not do harm to others.'   </p>

<p>As people gathered in the streets to party, Greater Manchester Police said they closed down illegal gatherings at properties in Altrincham and Flixton on Saturday night, as well as a large gathering of around 70 people in Mottram.</p>

<p>Fixed penalty notices were issued at each of the incidents as current rules only allow groups of up to 30 to meet.</p>

<p>The interventions came just hours after officers attended a gathering at an address in Stockport which had 45 people in attendance, and another address in north Manchester which they had been called to on two previous occasions.</p>

<p>Earlier, Nottinghamshire Police issued a teenager with a £10,000 fine for hosting a house party in Lenton, which saw more than 50 guests gather at a home on Harlaxton Drive.</p>

<p>The force said if the 19-year-old man fails to pay or contests the fine he will appear before a court.</p>

<p>Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cooper, from Nottinghamshire Police, warned anyone thinking of hosting parties ahead of the changes on Monday - when social gatherings in England will be limited to groups of six people both indoors and outdoors - to think again or face the consequences.</p>

<p>He said: 'We need to all remember we are very much still in the middle of a global pandemic and we all need to take responsibility for our actions.</p>

<p>'I want to send out a clear message to anyone who is thinking of deliberately hosting parties tonight or tomorrow night ahead of the rules changing to please not do this.</p>

<p>'We are not afraid to use the full powers we have and we will not tolerate those who are deliberately putting other people's lives in danger.'</p>

<p>As hundreds of Britons enjoyed a final weekend of freedom, police bosses urged people to look after each other and avoid a 'party weekend' before the restrictions are implemented.</p>

<p>John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: 'There is a real risk some members of the public will take advantage of the current situation and treat this weekend as a party weekend ahead of the tighter restrictions being introduced on Monday.</p>

<p>'Alcohol and warm weather are not a good combination at the best of times. Using the current situation as an opportunity and excuse to party would be incredibly irresponsible and put pressure not only on policing, but potentially on the ambulance service and NHS.</p>

<p>'We are in the grip of a deadly pandemic and we have seen cases increasing over recent weeks. Policing is under pressure like never before, but my colleagues will give enforcement notices if they feel it's appropriate, and we make no apology for doing so.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere, would-be revellers were encouraged to stay home as Birmingham became the latest city to be hit with localised lockdown rules after the number of coronavirus patients being admitted to hospitals doubled in a week. </p>

<p>From Tuesday, more than 1.5million people in Birmingham and neighbouring Solihull and Sandwell will be banned from mixing with anyone outside of their own household in private homes, pubs, restaurants or in gardens.</p>

<p>Yesterday, police officers told the Telegraph they fear Britain will resemble the 'last days of Rome' after this weekend amid a storm of decadent planned pre-lockdown parties.  </p>

<p>One officer, based in the north east of England, said: 'We are worried this weekend is going to be like the last days of Rome.  </p>

<p>'If people think they are not going to be allowed to go out and enjoy themselves for the next few months, they are going to go crazy and we will be left picking up the pieces.'</p>

<p>Britons have promised to run riot and enjoy one last knees-up with friends before Mr Johnson's stringent new coronavirus restrictions come into force.  </p>

<p>Many are having to cancel parties after warnings of a rapid increase in infections among people in their teens, 20s and 30s - but fears have risen that some will take the weekend as an opportunity to run wild despite the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>A senior officer said they were not sure if police had the resources to meet the challenge of thousands of people ignoring restrictions this weekend.   </p>

<p>Chairman of the Police Federation in West Yorkshire, Brian Booth, added officers were 'flat out again doing the everyday things such as dealing with stabbings, shootings, drug dealers, missing people etc'. </p>

<p>'If we are going to be asked to focus on enforcement, something else will have to give,' he said.       </p>
