<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fernando Torres has selected a combined XI from his time at Chelsea and Liverpool - but there's no place for Eden Hazard in his dream team.</p>

<p>Torres spent four years at Liverpool between 2007 and 2011 before joining Chelsea in a £50 million move, where he won the Champions League Europa League and FA Cup.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old announced his retirement from football last season after winding down his career at Japanese side Sagan Tosu. </p>

<p>Fernando Torres has picked a combined Liverpool and Chelsea XI from his time at both clubs</p>

<p>Torres spent four goal-laden seasons at Anfield before joining Chelsea in a £50m move in 2011</p>

<p>The former striker won the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup at Stamford Bridge</p>

<p>Shortly after retiring he returned to Stamford Bridge to visit former team-mates and colleagues and was asked to name a combined XI of Liverpool and Chelsea players.</p>

<p>It was no easy task, with Torres forced to leave out a host of star names. He said: 'I could make two or three teams of people I played with at Chelsea and Liverpool, and all of them would be good enough to win the Premier League in any year.'</p>

<p>After much deliberation, the Spaniard opted for former Reds goalkeeper Pepe Reina between the posts. 'With Reina I shared many times in Liverpool and also in the national team. 'Petr Cech is obviously one of the best goalkeepers I ever played with, so it would be a very difficult decision as a coach to make.' </p>

<p>Former Liverpool No 1, Pepe Reina, got the nod in goal ahead of Chelsea legend Petr Cech</p>

<p>Torres named John Terry and Sami Hyypia as centre-back partners at the heart of his back four </p>

<p>Chelsea pair Ashley Cole and Branislav Ivanovic were given the full-back berths by Torres</p>

<p>Torres opted for a 4-3-3 formation and a host of star names from his time at both clubs</p>

<p>At the heart of the back four, Torres opted for the hardened duo of John Terry and Sami Hyypia, who he believes would've formed an excellent partnership.</p>

<p>'I would have Sami Hyypia and John Terry in the middle of the defence – two strong centre-backs who are good with the ball and without the ball. I think they would be a really good partnership as well.' </p>

<p>Torres opted for Ashley Cole and Branislav Ivanovic as his choices at full-back before naming a stellar midfield trio in his 4-3-3 formation.</p>

<p>'The midfield might be the most difficult part, as I've been lucky to play with some fantastic midfielders. Obviously I have to go for Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, both of them have to be in there.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard made the cut for Torres' team</p>

<p>Xabi Alonso was also given a starting place in a holding role behind Gerrard and Lampard</p>

<p>Dirk Kuyt and Yossi Benayoun were surprise inclusions as forwards either side of Didier Drogba</p>

<p>Torres says Drogba was a natural choice as the man to lead the line as a lone striker in his side</p>

<p>'I played with so many great midfielders it's very hard to pick. I played with many, many great players and I'm worried I'm going to have to leave some of them out, but I will have Xabi Alonso as the other midfielder, playing behind Gerrard and Lampard.'</p>

<p>In attack, Torres chose Didier Drogba to lead the line but despite playing alongside a host of big name forwards at both clubs, he chose two players he believes were underrated but would ensure plenty of creativity.</p>

<p>'I will get Yossi Benayoun in there, who played for both Liverpool and Chelsea. He's a great friend and a great player. It was easy to play with him for me, he was always trying to give chances to the striker and looking for those small gaps that no-one can see but him.</p>

<p>''I will pick Dirk Kuyt on the right. He was always scoring important goals and put in a lot of hard work, always. It was amazing seeing the way he used to work and I don't think people really appreciated how good he was, but I could see it every day in training.' </p>
