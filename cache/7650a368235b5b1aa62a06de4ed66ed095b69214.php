<p>Australian entertainer Todd McKenney (pictured) has revealed which star he was least impressed with during his time choreographing Channel Seven's The All New Monty</p>

<p>Best known for his musical talents and as a judge on Australia's Dancing With The Stars, Todd said breakfast TV weatherman Sam Mac was the 'dodgiest stripper'.</p>

<p>'In terms of enthusiasm he was one of the best, but in terms of raw stripping dance ability… let's just say he got there,' he said.</p>

<p>Todd explained that AFL star Wayne Carey, who is set to bare all this week, also struggled.</p>

<p>'For a footballer who knows how to move so well on the field, he’s a bit of a fish out of water on the dance floor,' McKenney explained. </p>
