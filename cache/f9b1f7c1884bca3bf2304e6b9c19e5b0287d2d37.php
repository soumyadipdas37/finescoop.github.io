<p>A mother-of-two who fought a speeding fine and won has urged other drivers who believe they had been incorrectly penalised to take it up with authorities. </p>

<p>Renae Morrisey was sent a $233 infringement notice and docked three demerit points after a speed camera snapped a photo of her car on a busy Queensland motorway. </p>

<p>Ms Morrisey was falsely accused of travelling 113km/h in a 100km/hour zone along the Cunningham Highway at Ebbw Vale, outside Ipswich.</p>

<p>But when she looked at the photograph of her car, she discovered a major error.</p>

<p>Renae Morrisey was sent a $233 infringement and docked three demerit points after a speed camera snapped a photo of her car on a busy Queensland motorway</p>

<p>'There were two cars in the picture and I know I wasn't speeding,' she told Nine News.  </p>

<p>When she contacted Queensland's Road Safety Camera Office they confirmed her suspicions.</p>

<p>A large green circle identifying the speeding car was actually pointing to the other car's number plate.</p>

<p>The fine also identified the guilty driver was travelling in lane number two, when she had been travelling in lane one.  </p>

<p>A large green circle identifying the speeding car was actually pointing to the other car's number plate</p>

<p>After making the phone call she had the fine revoked. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two is urging drivers to dispute any penalties they believe were wrongfully issued, with most believing the only way to fight them is through court.  </p>

<p>Andrew Wiseman of Wiseman Lawyers said the first thing to do is pick up the phone.</p>

<p>'Contact the camera office, if you're of genuine belief it's not you or there's an error,' he said.</p>

<p>'A lot of the time, common sense will prevail.' </p>

<p>Anyone hoping to overturn an infringement will need to contact transport authorities within 28 days of receiving the fine.</p>

<p>After the 28-day period drivers will have to appeal any infringements before the courts.    </p>
