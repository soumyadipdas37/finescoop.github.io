<p>The goalkeeper was at fault for both the hosts' goals, first dithering over a clearance which was eventually charged down for Mark Duffy to make it 2-1 and then changing his mind over a cross and failing to keep out Callum Camps' overhead kick straight at him for 3-2.</p>

<p>Goals from Bernard and Michael Keane spared the shot-stopper's blushes but Everton fans aired their frustrations on Twitter, with some fans calling for Carlo Ancelotti to find a new No1. </p>

<p>Jordan Pickford made two errors in Everton's Carabao Cup win over Fleetwood on Wednesday</p>

<p>Some fans called for Carlo Ancelotti to find a new No1 after the shot-stopper's mistakes</p>

<p> </p>

<p>One supporter wrote: 'Jordan Pickford is going to cost Everton so many goals this season. Ancelotti needs to replace him ASAP.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Don't think we'll be able to bring in a top keeper this window but next summer we NEED a new top class GK Jordan Pickford man.'</p>

<p>But Ancelotti refused to blame the England international for the first goal, instead claiming the goalkeeper had been put in a difficult position by his team-mates. </p>

<p>'I think the first goal it was not any individual mistakes, we passed the ball back to Jordan and it was a really difficult ball,' said the Everton boss.</p>

<p>'We could have behaved differently, so we didn't do that well. Of course you have to improve there.</p>

<p>'You want to build up from the back but when there is not risk. If it is risky it is not good, we can concede a goal like we did tonight and it is a good lesson for the future.</p>

<p>'I didn't speak to him (Pickford). I have to speak with the players that were involved when we were building up. He was not the only one, Jordan.'</p>

<p>But some fans were less forgiving than the Italian, with one tweeting: 'If Jordan Pickford was a fisherman he still wouldn't catch anything.'</p>

<p>Another on-looker wrote: 'Everton seem to have brought in some very good players this transfer market, pity Jordan Pickford will undo all their good work.'</p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti refused to blame the England international for the goals Everton conceded</p>

<p>A brace from Richarlison and goals from Alex Iwobi, Bernard and Michael Keane set up a fourth-round tie with West Ham and Fleetwood boss Joey Barton highlighted the gulf in class between the Premier League outfit and his League One side.</p>

<p>'We had a 18-year-old, a 19-year-old and a 21-year-old at centre-back. We never had any ball but we knew that would be the case,' he said.</p>

<p>'We then gave them a goal and they got the second goal. We adjusted at half-time, brought Duffy on and then we got a gift by closing the keeper down.</p>

<p>'Then we shoot ourselves in the foot by conceding in a few minutes and then we got back into it again - but they have the quality to pick you off on the counter.</p>

<p>Pickford was unable to keep out Callum Camps' overhead kick despite it being straight at him</p>

<p>'I am pleased we made it into a cup tie because at half-time it looked like being a long 45 minutes.' </p>

<p>On Everton fielding a strong side, Barton added: 'I am delighted with that because it shows Everton are taking the competition seriously.</p>

<p>'It pays us enormous respect that they turned up and played in the correct manner, especially when you look at the gulf in class at both clubs. 5-2 probably flatters them at the end but they were way above us tonight.'</p>
