<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nick Kyrgios refused to back down in a Twitter spat with fellow player Karen Khachanov after being criticised for his reaction to Mats Wilander's comments on Andy Murray.</p>

<p>After Murray was eliminated from the French Open by Stan Wawrinka Swedish legend Wilander, winner of seven Grand Slam titles, said the Scot should look at whether it was right to take wildcards at the expense of younger players. </p>

<p>'I worry about Andy Murray. I would love to hear him say why he is out there, giving us a false sense of hope that he going to come back one day,' Wilander said. </p>

<p>Nick Kyrgios (left) and Karen Khachanov (right) engaged in a furious Twitter argument </p>

<p>The argument stemmed from Kyrgios' reaction to what Mats Wilander said about Andy Murray</p>

<p>Kyrgios told Wilander, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, to 'shut up' after the Swede suggested Murray was selfish in taking wildcards away from promising younger players</p>

<p>That tweet sparked a reaction from Khachanov which saw him begin calling for more 'respect'</p>

<p>'I keep getting a little bit disappointed, is it his right to be out there doing that? Why? I did it and I shouldn't have, it was the biggest mistake I did in my career. </p>

<p>'I think Andy Murray needs to stop thinking of himself and start thinking about who he was. Does he have a right to be out there taking wildcards from the young players?'  </p>

<p>Kyrgios is notoriously outspoken among ATP players and given he is particularly close to, and fond of, Murray, he put out a tweet telling Wilander to 'shut up', generating a response from world No 16 Khachanov.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Just read what Wilander said about <?php echo e('@'); ?>andy_murray.... shut up Mats, no one cares. Muzz, just know that how ever long you stay, we all appreciate and enjoy your tennis and banter. Also I've never watched a point of Mats Wilander.'</p>

<p>Khachanov, more conservative in criticising current and former players on the tennis circuit, responded: 'Nick, come on mate..it's too much..show some respect'.</p>

<p>Kyrgios was unwilling to concede that he had crossed a line in his critique of Wilander and doubled-down following Khachanov's reaction.  </p>

<p>The call for more respect did not sit well with Kyrgios, who defended close friend Murray</p>

<p>Things took a turn when Khachanov suggested Kyrgios only speaks out when he is at home</p>

<p>The world No 16 felt compelled to call Kyrgios out but it led to a ferocious exchange online</p>

<p>'Nah I'm good dude,' he tweeted. 'Muzz and I respect eachother, and if someone starts talking about one of mine then I'll come at them. I'm supposed to respect Mats? For what? Hitting a ball over the net? I don't give my respect for that.'</p>

<p>While the difference of opinion was initial focused on what Wilander had said it soon turned personal with the two men citing each other's intellect - or in their eyes, lack thereof. </p>

<p>Khachanov wrote back: 'Bro it's your call. I really think you are a good lad and I don't have any problem with you. But once you are sitting at home and writing different comments about players that makes me think who has the real problem..'</p>

<p>Tennis fans were left watching on as the pair exchanged barbs that became increasingly personal. </p>

<p>Kyrgios had been particularly damning of Novak Djokovic's shamed Adria Tour in which players were seen to have breached protocol when dancing shirtless in a bar together. </p>

<p>A number of players later tested positive for Covid-19 and Kyrgios was vocal in his criticism of his fellow players' behaviour. </p>

<p>Murray took a wildcard to play at the French Open but he was beaten in the opening round</p>

<p>Kyrgios said that his criticisms have simple been aired to hold people to account for actions</p>

<p>Khachanov took offence to intellect being questioned and cited Kyrgios' love of video games</p>

<p>The outspoken Australian was bemused by the back-and-forth and called him a 'pelican'</p>

<p>Khachanov insisted that he had not made it personal and Kyrgios is 'the one who wants a fight'</p>

<p>This was a point he pushed on Khachanov in response after the jibe about 'sitting at home' from the Russian. </p>

<p>He wrote back: 'So you think what the players did during this pandemic was smart? I'd love to have an intellectual conversation with you but I'm not sure it would go further than how hard you could hit a ball. I've simply been holding people accountable.'</p>

<p>'And next time before talking about my intellect read at least a few books , instead or playing video games whole day long,' Khachanov snapped back. </p>

<p>Kyrgios pointed to his charity work before labelling Khachanov an 'absolute pelican'. </p>

<p>'I've also been feeding the hungry, helping open up new facilities for kids to get active,' he tweeted. 'But way to do your research you absolute pelican.' </p>

<p>The pair's fraught exchange ended with Khachanov insisting he 'didn't go personal' against the Australian and that it was Kyrgios who 'wants a fight'. </p>

<p>'Again I didn't go personal against you. You are the one who wants a fight,' he said. 'If you don't get what I was trying to say, then may be you are 'too smart' to understand that. Enjoy your days at home.' </p>

<p>Djokovic and fellow tennis stars partied in a Belgrade nightclub during his Adria Tour, with some of the players taking their shirts off during the riotous evening</p>

<p>Kyrgios also had a pop at Djokovic for holding his infamous Adria Tour this summer</p>
