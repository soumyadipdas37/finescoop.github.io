<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Angry Melburnians have once again taken to the streets and clashed with police as they protest against the strict Stage Four restrictions for the fourth weekend in a row.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded just 12 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday and one death as the city's 14-day average continues to plummet.</p>

<p>But despite the positive steps, disgruntled anti-lockdown protesters have ignored the strict rules by 'doing something different' and organised 10 locations for protests across the city so people can remain with the 5km radius imposed on them.</p>

<p>The protests were organised via encrypted message groups in the hope that police would not find out about them. </p>

<p>There were 10 more locations where anti-lockdown protestors could attend in Melbourne (pictured: Two men detained at a Saturday protest)</p>

<p>Upon arrival, protestors were encouraged to sing John Farnham's popular song, You're the Voice. </p>

<p>'Prisoners get more freedom than free Victorians do,' a protester wrote in an encrypted message, Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>'Rallies will never be cancelled until all coronavirus restrictions end.</p>

<p>'Don't wait til JobKeeper ends to raise your voice. We need to speak out louder than ever before.'</p>

<p>Two men holding the Australia, American and the United Kingdom flag have already been detained by Victoria Police. </p>

<p>A trial has been set for Monday to challenge whether Melbourne's 8pm-5am and now 9pm-5am curfew is legal. </p>

<p>Melburnians have been extremely restricted from leaving their homes since August 2 when Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced a State of Disaster. </p>

<p>The case was launched by Mornington Peninsula cafe owner Michelle Loielo who claims she has had a massive drop in income due to the curfew. </p>

<p>Associate Professor Michelle Giles signed off on the curfew which was suggested by Chief Health officer Brett Sutton. </p>

<p>Melburnians can only leave home for one of four reasons: shopping, exercise, work and care or medical attention all within 5km of their home.</p>

<p>Residents in regional Victoria are already enjoying eased coronavirus restrictions after they moved away from Stage Three lockdown at 11.59pm on September 16. </p>

<p>Pubs, cafes and restaurants are able to serve people outside with strict density quotas, while outdoor gathering limits will be upped to 10.</p>

<p>Regional Victorians are also able to leave their homes without restriction and all shops can reopen.</p>

<p>They will still be able to travel via Melbourne to reach other parts of the state, but can only stop for three reasons including food, care and permitted work and study. </p>

<p>Melbourne residents who leave the city without a lawful excuse will be fined $4,957. </p>

<p>Victoria's state of emergency and disaster powers, extended until October 11, give police the power to detain someone 'for the period reasonably necessary to eliminate or reduce a serious risk to public health'.</p>

<p>Police officers can also search people's homes without a warrant and restrict movement between locations such as between regional Victoria and Melbourne.</p>
