<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tuscan Grand Prix qualifying gets underway today as Mercedes team-mates Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas look for 1-2 grid start on Mugello Circuit.</p>

<p>The championship-leading team were stunned last time out at Monza when AlphaTauri driver Pierre Gasly claimed his maiden F1 win of his career following a pit-lane penalty for Hamilton as he looked in complete control.Â Â </p>

<p>All eyes will be on Ferrari after a difficult season and their woes could run deeper with another disaster in their own country this weekend.Â Â </p>

<p>Sportsmail's KISHAN VAGHELA will provide live F1 qualifying coverage including lap times, fastest laps, pit stops and crashes.Â </p>

<p>'We have to be realistic you need to be in Mercedes to win the Championship, but those two seats are taken. It is mostly the team and the spirit and potential.</p>

<p>'There is more to come from that team [Aston Martin next year] than people have seen so far from.'</p>

<p>Strong words from Sebastien Vettel on his move.</p>

<p>It's been a difficult season so far for Ferrari, who are suffering their worst season in 30 years.</p>

<p>They are set toÂ celebrate 1,000th race on home soil in Mugello, but how do they get back on track? Can it start with qualifying?</p>

<p>Those words would be something we haven't really mentioned this season, and much in the last few seasons due to his dominance.</p>

<p>But Mugello be the circuit that adds some uncertainty though?</p>

<p>It is full of full-bore curves and roller-coaster rises and dips is a challenge the world champion says he is still getting used to, calling it 'intense' before qualifying.</p>

<p>Hamilton has often pulled a result out of the bag when he needs to, but with Bottas practice results he will need to so again.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Valterri Bottas 1:16.350</p></li>
<li><p>Max Verstappen +0.017</p></li>
<li><p>Lewis Hamilton +0.083</p></li>
<li><p>Lance Stroll +0.582</p></li>
<li><p>Pierre Gasly +0.696</p></li>
<li><p>Sergio Perez +0.811</p></li>
<li><p>Charles Leclerc +0.958</p></li>
</ol>

<p>8.Alex Albon +1.008</p>

<ol start="9">
<li><p>Danni Kvyat +1.097</p></li>
<li><p>Romain Grosjean +1.105</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Max Verstappen looks like he will be the closest contender to Mercedes duo Bottas and Hamilton for position on the grid, particuarly after the former swept practice.</p>

<p>But while there is a fabulous setting for today's qualifying and Sunday's race, a narrow track could well prove to be a challenge for all three.</p>

<p>Hello and welcome.</p>

<p>There were some amazing scenes a few days ago with Pierre Gasly but we are now in Tuscany for qualifying for the first ever Tuscan Grand Prix.</p>

<p>With the Vettel news of a move to Aston Martin and Bottas' excellent display in practice so far, this promises to be another thriller.</p>
