<p>The virus was detected in sewage in Anglesea, 110km south of Melbourne.</p>

<p>An active testing site has now been set up in the Anglesea town hall in a bid to find the source of the virus. </p>

<p>Fragments of COVID-19 have been found in a tiny seaside town with no known positive cases (Pictured: Healthcare workers are seen at a drive through pop up coronavirus testing facility in Clyde)</p>

<p>The virus was detected in sewerage sampling site in Anglesea (pictured), 110km south of Melbourne</p>

<p>'It's been a while since there has been a known positive cases in that area so it is a cause of concern for us,' Department of Health and Human Services testing commander Jeroen Weimar said.</p>

<p>'This is either somebody who has COVID-19 in that area or someone who has passed through or someone who is not yet aware they have COVID-19.'</p>

<p>A person with COVID-19 can shed the virus in their body waste even if they no longer test positive or have any symptoms. </p>

<p>Sewage testing sites have been set up across the country to detect unknown cases within the community.</p>

<p>Traces of Covid-19 were detected in sewage in two of Sydney's most popular beachside suburbs, Bondi and Malabar, earlier this month. </p>

<p>The positive samples were detected despite no cases of COVID-19 from an unknown source or any new clusters reported across the state in the past seven days. </p>

<p>The samples were taken from an area serving a population of more than two million Sydneysiders, including the CBD and quarantine hotels. </p>

<p>The NSW Sewage Surveillance Program has tested untreated sewerage at 42 sites across the state since July to track infection rates and provide health authorities early warning of a possible spike in infections. </p>

<p>Virus fragments have also been detected in previous samples across the state including metropolitan Sydney, Perisher in the Snowy Mountains, Newcastle, Byron Bay on the far north coast and the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.</p>

<p>COVID-19 was detected in sewage at Bondi for two consecutive weeks earlier in September. (Pictured: Sydneysiders at Bondi's iconic beach on August 20)</p>

<p>The virus was also detected in wastewater at Malabar (pictured) in Sydney's south-east</p>

<p>All positive samples except Perisher were in areas with known COVID-19 infections.</p>

<p>The mystery traces of the virus come as Victoria recorded 13 new cases of coronavirus and four deaths.</p>

<p>The latest figures reported on Wednesday showed the 14-day average of new cases had fallen to 16.4 in Melbourne and 0.3 in regional Victoria.</p>

<p>There are currently 21 coronavirus cases from an unknown source in Melbourne and none in regional Victoria. </p>

<p>The state's death toll has also risen to 798.</p>
