<p>Mummy Diaries is BACK! It seems drama was rife for the Shepherds at the start of lockdown, as the upcoming debut episode of the show sees Billie and Greg reveal he caused a fire in their home while deep-frying scampi</p>

<p>While sitting with their kids in the kitchen, Billie demands of Greg: 'What's the latest with that because it looks horrible?', before the camera turned to the singed kitchen. </p>

<p>Speaking to the camera, Billie detailed: 'Ok, on day two of lockdown, Greg decides he wants to deep fry some scampi', while Greg said: 'Scampi, I wanted a bit of scampi!'</p>

<p>Clearly tickled while regaling the story, she said: 'I said put it in the oven but he says no it needs to be deep fried.  I'm bathing the kids upstairs and all of a sudden I look around and the whole upstairs is filled with smoke.'</p>

<p>Greg recalled: 'It literally just went 'VOOM'', while Billie went on: I run down here and all i could see was the whole back of the cooker on fire.'</p>

<p>Oh no! Exchanging their usual hilarious banter, the couple, who share kids Nelly, six, and Arthur, three, revealed that the cooking gaffe caused their whole kitchen to become engulfed in flames</p>

<p>Problems: Speaking to the camera, Billie detailed: 'Ok, on day two of lockdown, Greg decides he wants to deep fry some scampi', while Greg said: 'Scampi, I wanted a bit of scampi!'</p>

<p>Blazing: Clearly tickled while regaling the story, she said: 'I said put it in the oven but he says no it needs to be deep fried. I'm bathing the kids upstairs and all of a sudden I look around and the whole upstairs is filled with smoke'</p>

<p>Finding the light in the situation however, the couple revealed Arthur had come to believe that the cast of Fireman Sam had put out the blaze.</p>

<p>Greg asked: 'Arthur, who came to put the fire out?' to which he responded in typically hilarious fashion: 'Fireman Sam, Penny, Elvis'.</p>

<p>The fire comes amid the couple's fight to begin renovations on their new £1.4 million Essex dream home, which, earlier in the week, Billie confirmed had been given the green light to start building.</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with MailOnline, the reality star, 30, revealed turning the rundown 1920s property in Brentwood into a five-bedroom luxury mansion will take a year after plans were delayed as neighbours deemed their submission 'too grand'. </p>

<p>All the stars! Finding the light in the situation however, the couple revealed Arthur had come to believe that the cast of Fireman Sam had put out the blaze</p>

<p>Oh no! Greg asked: 'Arthur, who came to put the fire out?' to which he responded in typically hilarious fashion: 'Fireman Sam, Penny, Elvis'</p>

<p>She also admitted their family have experienced 'highs and lows' in recent months as she touched on life in lockdown ahead of the return of The Mummy Diaries.</p>

<p>The TV stars - who purchased the house in January - will demolish the existing garage and conservatory to build a two-storey side extension and a single-storey rear extension.</p>

<p>The abode will also be complete with an in-and-out driveway along with a single-storey front extension and landscape work. </p>
