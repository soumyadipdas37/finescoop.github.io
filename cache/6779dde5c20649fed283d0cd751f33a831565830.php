<p>Date night: Jennifer Lawrence and her husband Cook Maroney looked happy in love, as they walked arm-in-arm to dine al fresco on a patio in New York City on Thursday</p>

<p>She completed her ensemble with a black bucket hat and a pair of figure-hugging white trousers.  </p>

<p>Once seated, Lawrence peeled off her hat to unveil her slightly wavy blonde hair and set down her elegant black leather Gucci bag. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Maroney opted for a more laid-back look, which included a white t-shirt, loose slacks and a pair of red, white and blue sneakers. </p>

<p>The Hunger Games star and her man, whom she wed in October of 2019, safely kept their noses and mouths covered under blue surgical masks. </p>

<p>Like his wife, who shielded her eyes under a pair of aviator sunglasses, Maroney wore a pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses. </p>

<p>Since Hollywood shut down due to the pandemic, Lawrence's usually busy schedule has lightened up considerably. </p>

<p>Staying safe: The Hunger Games star and her man, whom she wed in October of 2019, kept their noses and mouths covered under blue surgical masks</p>

<p>She has, however, had a few major milestones occur over the course of lockdown. Earlier this month the American Hustle star quietly celebrated her 30th birthday.</p>

<p>Her good friend Kris Jenner took to social media with a celebratory post of Jennifer, whom she called her 'favorite daughter,' to commemorate the big day.</p>

<p>Lawrence also finally unloaded her massive New York City penthouse, which had been on the market for a year.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the actress, she took a massive $5.7 million loss on the sprawling property, which she had scooped up for nearly $15.6 million million back in August 2016. </p>

<p>Milestones: Since Hollywood shut down due to the pandemic, Lawrence's usually busy schedule has lightened up considerably but she did celebrate her 30th birthday earlier this month (Pictured with Kris Jenner in the Momager's Happy Birthday message)</p>
