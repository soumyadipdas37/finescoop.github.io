<p>Calling him out: X Factor star Lucy Spraggan has hit out at a 'gross' man who cat-called her while she was out shopping, explaining that a few seconds after she had her photo snapped she was 'meowed' at</p>

<p>'I wish this picture had been taken a couple of seconds later so that the man who walked by, looked me up and down, then in the eye, and said ‘meow meow’ who I then told to “get f**ked” was in it,' she told her fans.</p>

<p>'Because then, as always, if you remind the gross men out there not to whistle/shout/kiss their lips/meow at you you’ll get called a ‘stupid f**king bitch’ like I just did,' she continued.</p>

<p>'For anyone out there who is going to say ‘get f**ked’ deserved an aggressive response back think about the scenario in your mind’s eye.'</p>

<p>Mind your own business: 'I wish this picture had been taken a couple of seconds later so that the man who said ‘meow meow’ who I then told to “get f**ked” was in it,' she told her fans</p>

<p>Standing her ground: Lucy continued in her Instagram Stories, telling her followers: 'Men out there who cat-call women. It doesn't work. Has it ever f**king worked for you?'</p>

<p>'I didn’t engage with him, start a conversation with him, I didn’t wink at him or invite him to talk to me... He walked past me he meowed at me. Twice. Like a stupid f**cking predator looking at its prey. But I didn’t get his picture. Just me lookin’ catty obvs.'</p>

<p>Lucy continued in her Instagram Stories, telling her followers: 'Men out there who cat-call women. It doesn't work. Has it ever f<strong>king worked for you? Because I've pulled quite a few women in my time and I've never f</strong>king cat called any of them.' </p>

<p>Last week Lucy said that she now feels sexy for the first time, 10 months after splitting from her ex-wife and transforming her lifestyle.</p>

<p>The singer, 29, completely changed her lifestyle this year after getting into fitness and taking up running during lockdown.</p>

<p>Speaking on FUBAR Radio, the X Factor star explained she 'lost a bit of weight and had a divorce' and then 'rediscovered herself' which helped with her confidence. </p>

<p>Feeling good: Earlier this month Lucy revealed that she now feels sexy, 10 months after her divorce and completely transforming her lifestyle to fell more confident</p>

<p>Lucy told hosts Bobby Norris and Stephen Leng on Access All Areas that she hasn't always felt confident but getting healthy has helped change her mindset and inspired her to write new song Flower.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've never felt sexy in my life. I've never felt attractive or in tune with myself in that way. And I kind of like, found myself experiencing that and I really wanted to make a song that was a bit like, yeah, this is how I feel! This is sexy!'</p>

<p>Lucy split from her wife Georgina Gordon in November 2019, after six years together and fostering 12 children while they underwent fertility treatment.</p>

<p>In her statement at the time, Lucy said: 'It's with sadness to let you know that after nearly 6 years of joy, fun and true love Georgina and I have decided to part ways.</p>

<p>Exes: The X Factor star split from her wife Georgina Gordon in November 2019, after six years together</p>

<p>'We have shared the most amazing times and life together, and we are truly grateful for knowing love at its full capacity. We will continue on our paths as ultimate friends, and dog Mums, united by the bond and memories we will always have...</p>

<p>'We are eternally thankful for the support you have offered to us; in this time of hardship we we appreciate space and time to deal with the change.' </p>

<p>However despite a turbulent 18 months, which also saw her quit booze and undergo a massive body transformation, the Derbyshire born songwriter is in a better place now.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've spent so long absolutely f*****g miserable, that's the thing. So I'm like, I do have this like, "I'm so happy" about me, but some days are still s**t. So I'm gonna enjoy the days where I like skipping on the treadmill.'</p>

<p>Wow! Lucy overhauled her lifestyle to achieve her new ripped physique and healthy mindset following the breakdown of her marriage to Georgina</p>

<p>During her interview, Lucy also hinted that one of the reasons for her new found happiness could be her love interest who she described as 'wicked and great'.</p>

<p>Speaking more of the 'hot gal', who she mentioned on Instagram after going on a date earlier this month, she said: 'I've been seeing her for a bit. </p>

<p>'I've been very open about my life, like a lot about my life my whole life, and this time I'm a bit like, do you know what, I'm going to keep some stuff for myself.'</p>

<p>Although she kept her cards close to her chest, Lucy did reveal that her new flame is 'a sober babe too'.   </p>

<p>When asked if it was important for her to date someone who also didn't drink, she explained: 'It depends what kind of drinking.' </p>

<p>Never better: The singer marked 11 months of sobriety in June by sharing a candid post revealing how she's never 'felt as alive and awake' after giving up alcohol</p>

<p>Candid: Lucy shared a lengthy post revealing she got tired of 'hiding behind the false confidence alcohol gave' as she celebrated her sobriety achievement in the summer</p>

<p>Lucy explained how she isn't the type of person to just have one drink and this can make dating a little tougher.  </p>

<p>The musician also revealed that the meaning of her new song Flower isn't so simple, explaining that the track is actually 'about orgasms'.</p>

<p>Lucy said: 'So the song itself is about orgasms, right, which is something I would never, never have covered before… You know, year of the vagina, WAP and all that stuff. I may have coined that myself. I'm not going off any Zodiac!' </p>

<p>Despite the new found confidence, Lucy found filming the music video for her new single Flower was awkward at times as the directors kept telling her to be a 'bit more sexy'. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, quitting drinking has transformed Lucy's life but it's also left her surprised as to what she's able to face.</p>

<p>The singer said: 'There's limits and boundaries that I've pushed so hard because I know I can say no to alcohol. And so it means that I can break other boundaries.'</p>

<p>Giving an example, she said: 'With the running I got a bit obsessed. I did a 10K after three weeks and a half marathon, like 22K, in lockdown in six weeks!</p>

<p>'In lockdown I was running a half marathon every week in one go and then I was running 5K's as well in the same week. I'm not doing that now!'</p>

<p>LThe star also candidly discussed her sobriety journey back in June when she marked being 11 months sober.</p>
