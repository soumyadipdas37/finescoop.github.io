<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An accused paedophile has had his bail revoked after he allegedly 'expressed an intention to infect children with HIV'.</p>

<p>Jadd William Brooker, 38, has been charged with multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material between December 2015 and August this year.</p>

<p>Police have allegedly identified potential victims in Australia, Canada and Italy.</p>

<p>Brooker, who lives in Glenelg East, South Australia, was granted bail on Thursday at Christies Beach Magistrates Court in Adelaide.</p>

<p>He was ordered to live with his grandmother in home detention until his next court appearance.</p>

<p>This is was despite police gathering evidence which allegedly showed that Brooker, who is HIV positive, intended to infect children and adults with the disease.  </p>

<p>However the Supreme Court overturned the decision to release the alleged paedophile on bail on Friday, remanding him in custody until April next year. </p>

<p>Jadd William Brooker, 38, has been charged with multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material between December 2015 and August this year </p>

<p>On Friday, the Supreme Court overturned the decision to release Brooker on bail</p>

<p>Brooker allegedly pursued 19 children for sex over apps like Skype and Telegram and had ongoing sexual relationships with two teenage girls.</p>

<p>One of the girls has since killed herself, while the other had no idea Brooker was HIV positive and is awaiting test results.     </p>

<p>Police insist that this is just the beginning of their case against Brooker after seizing his phones, computers and hard drives which allegedly contained 4.5million images. </p>

<p>Officers have viewed 350,000 photos so far, with 10,000 of them allegedly depicting child exploitation. A further 7,000 mages did not even 'exist' on the internet.    </p>

<p>'These images are certainly of the most heinous nature (and) the allegations are extremely serious in respect to (the interstate teen), prosecutor Lucy Boord told the court, Adelaide Now reported.</p>

<p>'There is footage of unprotected sexual interaction with that child, who is now having to be tested.'</p>

<p>Police allege one of the teenagers Brooker allegedly had sex with did not know he was HIV positive</p>

<p> Police are also investigating a massive 50,000 messages from Brooker's devices</p>

<p>Police are also investigating 50,000 messages from Brooker's devices finding 'eight or nine additional, unidentified potential victims'. </p>

<p>When he was contacted in prison by his mother she volunteered to delete Brooker's Facebook account and he asked her to wipe other accounts for him, the court heard.</p>

<p>Brooker allegedly provided his email and password for his Microsoft Live account and asked his mother to delete it. </p>

<p>'Given the nature of the charges, a lot of potential evidence is stored in the cloud – potentially millions of pieces of evidence – and this is an attempt to destroy it before police can uncover it,' police prosecutors said.  </p>

<p>Despite the warnings from police Magistrate Rodney Oates granted bail as he had no prior criminal history, no breaches of bail and the presumption of innocence. </p>

<p>Brooker is yet to plead to multiple counts of disseminating and possessing child exploitation material. </p>

<p>Brooker has had his bail revoked and will be remanded in custody until April next year </p>
