<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Premier League clubs are bracing themselves for another £100million of losses amid fears that the return of fans may be delayed until November.</p>

<p>Representatives of the major sports met Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden on Wednesday to discuss their aspirations for supporters to attend matches as soon as possible, with a further update expected next week.</p>

<p>The government had initially planned to sanction crowds from October 1, but that date is now in doubt due to rising Covid-19 infection rates and the introduction of the rule of six, with administrators now fearing that a November return is more likely. </p>

<p>Fans watched the pre-season friendly between Brighton and Chelsea as part of a pilot scheme</p>

<p>Premier League clubs would be the worst hit given the size of their crowds, with monthly losses at present estimated at £100m, while a continued shut-out would leave several EFL clubs fearing for their future.</p>

<p>The EFL say their clubs can accommodate crowds at between 25 per cent and 35 per cent of stadium capacity whilst maintaining 1 metre social distancing, and have announced that nine pilot matches with crowds of 1,000 will take place this weekend.</p>

<p>'There is a mutual understanding of the need to get fans back in, whilst all acknowledging the very significant headwinds we face with the virus,' Dowden said. </p>

<p>'I know that many fans are eager to return to football and that jobs depend on this too, so fans will welcome [this] news. This will help us build the evidence base to see how we can return fans safely in greater numbers as soon as it is safe to do so.'</p>

<p>The EFL will continue to stage pilots with up to 1,000 spectators at matches this weekend</p>
