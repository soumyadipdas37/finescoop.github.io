<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Watercolour paintings which were set to hang on the walls of a student flat in Stoke are expected to fetch £20,000 at an auction after they were revealed to be the work of a celebrated Chinese artist.</p>

<p>The three paintings by Qi Baishi were found in Barlaston, Staffordshire, during a routine visit by Alexander Clement, consultant valuer for Hansons Auctioneers. </p>

<p>He said: 'The paintings, each depicting a different flower, were purchased in London in the 1950s by a lady who was excited to receive her first pay cheque and wanted to buy something beautiful to adorn her home.</p>

<p>Three watercolour paintings which were found in a home in Barlaston, Staffordshire, are worth £20,000 after they were found to be the work of renowned Chinese painter Qi Baishi</p>

<p>'The paintings remained in the family home, latterly in Staffordshire, where they were hung on the staircase wall.</p>

<p>'They were passed handed down through the family but were not thought to be more than decorative and had been destined to decorate a student flat.'</p>

<p>The work of influential Chinese artist Qi Baishi, pronounced Chee Buy-shee, is highly regarded and sought after by many collectors, both in mainland China as well as Britain.</p>

<p>Mr Clement added: 'During the course of valuing the general contents of the home, I immediately recognised the paintings and set about researching them to verify if they were original works or print reproductions. </p>

<p>'I was delighted to find they were, indeed, original ink and watercolour studies, each bearing a seal by the artist.'</p>

<p>Each painting measures a mere 29cm by 20cm but are set to fetch a staggering total price of around £15,000 to £20,000. </p>

<p>The paintings (above) were set to hang in a student flat in Stoke but will now be sold individually at Hansons's Fine Art Auction on September 24 in Etwall, Derbyshire</p>

<p>Qi Baishi's Twelve Landscape Screens set a record for the highest-selling Chinese painting ever sold at auction at £107.5million, setting high hopes for the watercolour paintings (above)</p>

<p>Qi Baishi, who died in Beijing on September 19, 1957, had a reputation for his wide variety of subjects for his unique artwork.</p>

<p>His earlier works included performers, everyday people and animals, but he was then introduced to the xeiyi, or freestyle method of painting, by his mentor Wu Changshuo.</p>

<p>In 2017, his Twelve Landscape Screens (1925), set a new record for the highest-selling Chinese painting ever sold at auction at £107.5million.</p>

<p>Qi, who was born on January 1, 1864, was first trained as a carpenter and taught himself to paint using the Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden, a painting guidebook from the Qing dynasty era. </p>

<p>The paintings will be sold individually at Hansons's Fine Art Auction on September 24 in Etwall, Derbyshire.</p>
