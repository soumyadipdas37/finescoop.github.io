<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fulham youngster Sylvester Jasper is emerging a target for a host of Championship clubs ahead of the new season.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old forward is highly regarded at Craven Cottage and has already featured for the first team under Scott Parker.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether the newly promoted club will consider allowing Jasper leave on loan ahead of the new season as Parker sizes up Fulham's return to the Premier League.</p>
