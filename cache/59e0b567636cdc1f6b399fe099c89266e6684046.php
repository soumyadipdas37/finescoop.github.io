<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>European stock exchange owner Euronext has tabled an offer to buy the Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange (LSE).</p>

<p>Euronext said it had finally submitted its long-rumoured proposal, partnering with Italy's sovereign wealth fund CDP Equity and banking group Intesa Sanpaolo.</p>

<p>The offer pits Euronext against Switzerland's exchange SIX and Germany's Deutsche Boerse, both of which have also joined the race for the Italian exchange.</p>

<p>Euronext has tabled an offer to buy Milan-based exchange the Borsa Italiana  partnering with Italy's sovereign wealth fund CDP Equity and banking group Intesa Sanpaolo</p>

<p>The LSE bought Borsa Italiana in 2007 for £1.5billion, but the bids are thought to value the company at more than £3billion.</p>

<p>A sale of the Italian unit should help the LSE in its efforts to get its blockbuster £20billion merger with data provider Refinitiv over the line. </p>

<p>It wants to win approval from the European Union's competition watchdogs, which launched an investigation into the deal in June.</p>

<p>Euronext said: 'The proposed combination of Borsa Italiana and Euronext would create a leading player in continental European capital markets, where Italy would be the largest revenue contributor to the enlarged Euronext group.'</p>

<p>Euronext has been in the shadow of the LSE, with a market value of just £6.5billion compared to the British exchange's £32billion.</p>
