<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fans of The Bachelor couldn't resist fawning over runner-up Bella Varelis' handsome - and surprisingly young - stepfather during hometown visits last week.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, the 25-year-old marketing consultant spoke about her stepdad, Dean, on the podcast Life Uncut.</p>

<p>Bella admitted she found it 'gross' that some viewers described Dean as a 'younger' and 'hotter' alternative to leading man Locky Gilbert. </p>

<p>Speaking out: The Bachelor's Bella Varelis (pictured) has responded to 'gross' claims about her surprisingly young stepdad, who was featured on the show during hometown visits last week</p>

<p>'Oh my god, it's so gross,' she said.</p>

<p>'I saw a meme that was something like, "When Bella's stepdad is the hottest thing to walk in on the Bachelor 2020," and I was like, "Wow."'</p>

<p>Bella explained that Dean and her mother, Kim, who share a 13-year age gap, were 'blessed' to have found each other.</p>

<p>Awkward! Bella admitted she found it 'gross' that some viewers described her stepfather, Dean (pictured), as a 'younger' and 'hotter' alternative to leading man Locky Gilbert</p>

<p>Her comments come after fans flocked to Twitter following last week's hometown visits to share their thoughts on Dean's youthful looks. </p>

<p>One viewer jokingly tweeted: 'Is Bella's stepdad legally allowed to drink wine at the dinner table?'</p>

<p>Others added: 'Bella's stepdad looks younger than Locky' and 'Sorry did they just say that was Bella's stepdad? Sis, he's younger than Locky.'</p>

<p>Smitten: Fans couldn't resist fawning over Bella's handsome stepdad during hometown visits. Several viewers even said he was better looking than leading man Locky Gilbert (pictured) </p>

<p>'Most attractive': Bella's good-looking stepdad became a trending topic on Twitter last week</p>

<p>Another tweeted: 'The most attractive man to appear on The Bachelor is Bella's stepdad #TheBachelorAU.'</p>

<p>One viewer pointed out the difference between Bella's father, Steve, and her stepdad, tweeting: 'No wonder Bella's dad is a salty b*****d... look at who his wife remarried! The stepdad is the age of Bella!'</p>

<p>Despite Dean's unlikely heartthrob status, he seems to be quite private and doesn't post many photos on social media.</p>

<p>Jealous? One viewer pointed out the difference between Bella's father, Steve (right), and her stepdad (left), tweeting: 'No wonder Bella's dad is a salty b*****d - look who his wife remarried!' </p>

<p>Youthful: Some fans incorrectly stated that Bella and her stepfather were the same age</p>
