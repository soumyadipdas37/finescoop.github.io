<p>Discovery: A university student stumbled across unknown papers written by Abraham Lincoln</p>

<p>University student David Spriegel was in his second week of a summer internship when he made the discovery of a lifetime.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old, who just finished his junior year at St. Mary’s University in Minnesota, was preparing a stack of old papers to be logged in a database and put into storage.</p>

<p>As he was examining the documents at the aptly named Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois he noticed a tiny inscription that had been previously overlooked.</p>

<p>It read: 'The above memorandum is in the inscription of Abraham Lincoln. — M. Hay'.</p>

<p>The 167-year-old documents are handwritten memos detailing parcels of land being bought and sold in Springfield, dating from the future president's days as a lawyer in that city.</p>

<p>The intended recipient, Milton Hay, a clerk in the Stuart and Lincoln office, would have recognized his handwriting.</p>

<p>Experts have now confirmed that the documents are authentic Lincolns, and will join the over 1,800 other original manuscripts by the president at the museum.</p>

<p>Memorabilia relating to the 16th president of the United States can fetch thousands of dollars and even items relating to Lincoln's dog Fido are snapped up by enthusiasts.</p>

<p>Lincoln, who was assassinated by well-known actor John Wilkes Booth on April 15 1865, was the first Republican president when he was elected in 1860.</p>

<p>A spokesman told American newspaper the Daily Herald that such a find is very unusual indeed, especially for someone as green as Spriegel.</p>

<p>'They’re a rare find, to be sure — one or two such documents might pop up every year or so', said museum spokesman David Blanchette.</p>

<p>'That kind of discovery is seldom made by an inexperienced intern.</p>

<p>'They’re usually researchers with many, many years of experience,' Blanchette said.</p>
