<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's complex coronavirus rules have confused even the Prime Minister as numerous different restrictions are put in place across the country to try and keep the number of coronavirus cases down.</p>

<p>Aside from the standard rules in England, eight different regions have additional restrictions or rules that differ from those in place in England.</p>

<p>In total around 16.6m people in the UK are subject to local lockdowns, one quarter of the population.</p>

<p>Among the subtle differences are those between different local lockdown areas in England. For example in the North East, residents are legally banned from meeting people from outside their households inside pubs - but are free to do so outdoors. </p>

<p>In Bolton pubs and restaurants are closed completely and can do takeout only while funerals and weddings are limited to six people. In the North East the weddings and funeral limit remains 15.  </p>

<p>Also in Bolton, the government advises residents of these areas not to mix outdoors, but does not ban it.  </p>

<p>The devolved regions also have different rules. The rule of six applies to children in England, but not to under 12s in Scotland and under-11s in Wales. </p>

<p>In Scotland the rule of six is limited to people from two households in Scotland. Residents are not allowed to host guests in their own homes, if the guests are from outside their household or support bubble. </p>

<p>In Wales the rule of six is limited to people of up to four households indoors. Outdoors, people can gather in groups of up to 30 but should maintain social distancing from people from other households.</p>

<p>In Welsh local lockdown areas people can meet in their own gardens in groups of up to 30, but in English local lockdown areas the rules apply to gardens as a well as inside homes. Welsh people are also banned from leaving local lockdown areas unless they have a 'reasonable excuse'. </p>

<p>Welsh wedding ceremonies do not have a limit on the number of attendees, but they must wear masks including the bride and groom. Welsh wedding receptions are limited to 30 people.  </p>

<p>These are the rules: </p>

<p>England:</p>

<p>Social gatherings </p>

<p>No more than six people are permitted to gather indoors or outdoors - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work, or 'exceptional life events'.</p>

<p>Children are not exempt from the rules, unlike in Wales and Scotland </p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. </p>

<p>Pubs and Restaurants </p>

<p>Pubs and restaurants across England must close at 10pm. The rule of six still applies but applies to each group inside - not the venue as a whole. </p>

<p>Venues are now 'legally required' to take and keep the contact details of a member from every group of visitors for 21 days. This is so they can pass them on to NHS Test and Trace 'without delay' if needed.</p>

<p>The hospitality venue could face a fine if it fails to stick to the Covid security standards and the Government pledged to back local authorities to make 'further and faster use of their powers' against venues who break the rules. </p>

<p>Covid-19 secure venues, such as places of worship, restaurants and hospitality venues, can still host larger numbers in total but groups of up to six must not mix or form larger groups.</p>

<p>Travel</p>

<p>The rule of six limit does not apply to strangers gathering in the same space, such as a train or bus.</p>

<p>Government guidelines say: 'You can help control coronavirus and travel safely by walking and cycling, if you can. However, where this is not possible, you can use public transport or drive. </p>

<p>'If you do use public transport, you must wear a face covering and you should follow the safer travel guidance for passengers.'</p>

<p>Schools  </p>

<p>Face masks not required in schools outside local lockdown areas. Face masks are required for school pupils in Year 7 or above in communal areas in areas where local lockdowns are in place.  </p>

<p>Work  </p>

<p>The six person limit does not apply to gatherings for work. Offices should take steps to ensure social distancing is maintained.</p>

<p>The government initially urged workers to return to the office, but has since U-turned and called for anyone who can work from home to do so to try to drive down the number of cases.</p>

<p>Sport </p>

<p>You can continue to take part in organised sporting or licensed physical activity in groups of more than 6 outdoors and up to 6 people indoors (for over 18s). </p>

<p>Organised dance and exercise classes can take place in groups of more than six, but you must not mix with more than five other participants. </p>

<p>Masks</p>

<p>Face coverings have to be worn on public transport, in shops and supermarkets. They are also needed in other indoor venues such as museums, cinemas, galleries and places of worship.</p>

<p>The government also advised people to where them wherever they cannot keep to social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>Hospitality and retail workers now have to wear face coverings at work, as well as passengers in taxis.</p>

<p>Weddings and Funerals  </p>

<p>Weddings are limited to 15 people and funerals are limited to 30 people. Staff working at these events are not included.   </p>

<p>North East:</p>

<p>Seven local authorities in the North East are subject to some of the strictest restrictions, which came into force on Wednesday. The affected areas are:</p>

<p>How are the rules different to the rest of England?  </p>

<p>Social gatherings</p>

<p>Residents are legally banned from meeting friends who are not in their household or support bubble indoors. This includes in their homes or gardens, pubs and restaurants. But it does not include anywhere outdoors including pub beer gardens. </p>

<p>The police will be able to take action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at £200 for those who participate in illegal gatherings. </p>

<p>While the rules do not ban people from meeting under the rule of six outside, the government advice states residents should not 'socialise with people you do not live with'. It also advises against visiting care home residents. </p>

<p>Pubs and Restaurants </p>

<p>Travel</p>

<p>Public transport is restricted to 'essential trips', be it work or school or looking after an elderly relative. Going outside the area is also restricted to 'essential' reasons.</p>

<p>Weddings and Funerals</p>

<p>Same as the rest of the country. </p>

<p>Bolton</p>

<p>Are there any loopholes?</p>

<p>Despite vast swathes of England, Scotland and Wales being under some form of local lockdown, there are some loopholes people could exploit.</p>

<p>Get a pint after 10pm</p>

<p>Punters can still get their hands on a draft pint after 10pm if they use establishments at motorway services because they are classed as an essential service.</p>

<p>The Hope and Champion is a Wetherspoon at Beaconsfield Services on the M40, in Buckinghamshire is one pub that can still legally serve after the curfew lasting until 5am. It provides food and drink for those on the roads, so now remains open later than other pubs.</p>
