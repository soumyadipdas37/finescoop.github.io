<p>'We are able to operate. we're able to shoot, and we're able to more or less have a normal life here right now,' he said to Schwarzenegger, who has starred in three of Cameron's films: The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) and True Lies (1994).</p>

<p>'So we're very fortunate. So I don't see any roadblocks to use getting the picture finished -- getting both pictures finished.'    </p>
