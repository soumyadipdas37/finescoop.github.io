<p>Kate took a break from work to spend time with her children and husband, Derek, 53, who remains in intensive care as he continues to recover from COVID-19.</p>

<p>But last week she announced she would be returning to her Smooth Radio show so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love.'  </p>

<p>She will record her show from 10am to 1pm everyday this week, after her friend Myleene Klass filled in for her during her break.     </p>

<p>Derek was hospitalised back in March after suffering complications from contracting COVID-19, and has remained there since.   </p>

<p>Last Thursday the TV star revealed how she celebrated her 15th wedding anniversary with Derek after being unable to visit him in hospital.  </p>

<p>Speaking on Good Morning Britain, she revealed she was able see him later in the day, but admitted it felt 'strange' as Derek is in a limited consciousness state.  </p>

<p>Kate revealed: 'We did our best to make it special. We had him on FaceTime. We raised a glass to say happy anniversary.</p>

<p>'I have a card to take to read to him. He was a prolific card writer for birthdays. He'd always remember. And hopefully he'll do it again. </p>

<p>Moving: Kate, who recently returned to work on GMB, announced she would return to Smooth Radio last week so that Derek 'can hear my voice as well as many of the songs we both love'</p>

<p>'It will be strange reading to him, but this time I have made a bit more of an effort.'   </p>

<p>Derek is now in a limited consciousness and is unable to talk - but can hear things. His carers have been playing GMB on TV for him, while Kate is on. </p>

<p>Kate returned to the studio having taken time out to settle her children into school, after what has been a challenging six months for the family.</p>

<p>She shares Darcey, 14, and William, 11, with Derek. He is one of an estimated just five people in the world whose bodies have been damaged so much by COVID-19.</p>
