<p>The Australian actress revealed she is currently 83kg (13 stone, or 183lbs).</p>

<p>Green with envy! The Australian actress revealed she is currently 83kg and only a few kilos off her goal weight of 75kg </p>

<p>'The blonde uploaded photos of herself flaunting her slimmed-down figure in a blue wrap dress, explaining in the caption that she's not far off her goal weight of 75kg (11.8 stone, or 165lbs).</p>

<p>'Thanks for all the love so far on my 'Year of Health' journey,' she wrote in the caption of her post. </p>

<p>'When I was reaching for the candies last night after dinner I thought to myself 'hmmmm...better not' and had a bottle of water instead. </p>

<p>She added: '8kg to go until I hit my goal - hopefully I can do it by the end of the year.'</p>

<p>Rebel has lost an estimated 18kg since the start of the year, after she announced in January that she was going to make her health a priority in 2020.</p>

<p>'So for me 2020 is going to be called 'The Year of Health',' she wrote on Instagram at the time.</p>

<p>'So I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now,' she declared.</p>

<p>'And [I'm] trying to avoid the sugar and junk food, which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!'</p>
