<p>A fancy cafe and bakery has been slapped with a hefty fine after a routine inspection found the kitchen was so dirty it was rife with cockroaches </p>

<p>Inspectors found the cafe's director and part-owner had failed to carry out pest control after noticing the insects two days earlier.</p>

<p>They also found unidentifiable matter in a drain as well as in bread pans, on the floor and walls in parts of the premises.</p>

<p>When confronted one of the part-owners they said 'we don't take them very lightly at all, because we deal with people's lives.'</p>

<p>He claimed to have already booked in pest control for the next day, and admitted the situation was 'unbelievably unacceptable'. </p>

<p>In Brisbane Magistrates Court on Thursday, the part-owner pleaded guilty to four counts each of failing to comply with the Food Act.  </p>

<p>They also found unidentifiable matter in a drain as well as in bread pans and on the floor and walls in parts of the premises</p>

<p>When confronted,a part-owner said 'we don't take them very lightly at all, because we deal with people's lives'</p>

<p>Inspectors suspended the cafe's food licence before reinstating it the following day after they fixed the issues.</p>

<p>Barrister Michael Henry told the court the owners contacted a pest controller on the day the cockroaches were found, but the pest company couldn't visit the cafe immediately.</p>

<p>The business had paid pest control to be carried out monthly rather than quarterly as recommended by exterminators. </p>

<p>Magistrate Colin Strofield fined the owner $2000 and no conviction was recorded. </p>
