<p>'It’s a seven-day-a-week commitment. If you’re going to do a restaurant the right way, you always have to be there. </p>

<p>In an interview with The New York Times in 2011, Lenny Kravitz said of him: 'He’s all love.</p>

<p>Kravitz paid for a new awning for the restaurant out of gratitude.  </p>

<p>Until recently, Vitolo Jr. was dating fashion designer Rachel Emmons. They are shown, right, in an Instagram post from July 27, that was posted by one of their friends</p>

<p>The 33-year-old has also tried his hand at acting </p>

<p>'They just come. </p>

<p>'I swear to God. Lenny might come in with Denzel. It’s word of mouth,' he told the Times. </p>

<p>There are no reservations and the restaurant does not even have its own website. </p>

<p>Recently, it has been among the thousands in New York City to offer outdoor dining. </p>

<p>Peasant, where the pair were spotted on Sunday night, is a stone's throw from Vitolo's family haunt. </p>

<p>He and Holmes first sparked rumors of romance when they were spotted on September 4 dining out. He had his arms wrapped around her. </p>

<p>Sunday night's very public display of affection from the pair comes a year after her romance with Jamie Foxx came to an end. </p>
