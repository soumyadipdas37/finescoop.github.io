<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>China has successfully launched a carrier rocket from a ship in the Yellow Sea on Tuesday morning, sending nine satellites into the planned orbit.</p>

<p>The Long March-11, a solid propellant carrier rocket, blasted off at 9:23am local time today in waters off the coast of east China's Shandong province.</p>

<p>After travelling 535 kilometres (332 miles) within about 13 minutes, the rocket delivered nine Jilin 1 high-resolution Earth-observation satellites - three to take videos and six to take pictures - in sun-synchronous orbits, reported state media.</p>

<p>The CZ-11 rocket, or Long March-11, carrying nine satellites, rises from a ship in the Yellow Sea in east China's Shandong province Tuesday. The launch came just three days after China lost an optical remote-sensing satellite after it failed to reach the pre-set obit on Saturday</p>

<p>The country’s latest space project is said to be China’s second sea-based launch mission. The rocket's first ship-based launch took place in the Yellow Sea in June last year</p>

<p>The launch came just three days after China lost an optical remote-sensing satellite after it failed to reach the pre-set obit on Saturday.</p>

<p>The country’s latest space project is said to be China’s second sea-based launch mission. The rocket's first ship-based launch took place in the Yellow Sea in June last year and sent seven satellites into orbit.</p>

<p>The nine satellites, developed by Changguang Satellite Technology, weighs about 42 kilogrammes (93 pounds), according to reports.</p>

<p>They can provide remote-sensing data and a range of services including forestry, agriculture and maritime, for their clients.</p>

<p>The rocket lifted off from Debo 3, a self-propelled deck barge that was modified for the mission, said state media.</p>

<p>The Long March-11, weighing about 58 tonnes, is a light-lift solid launch vehicle and the only solid-fuel rocket in the Long March family, the pillar of China's space programmes</p>

<p>The Long March-11, weighing about 58 tonnes, is a light-lift solid launch vehicle and the only solid-fuel rocket in the Long March family, the pillar of China's space programmes, said Chinese media.</p>

<p>Before the Tuesday launch, it had conducted nine successful flights, including China's first sea launch conducted in June 2019.</p>

<p>The entire flight was controlled and monitored by engineers on board a support ship anchored several kilometres from the Debo 3. </p>

<p>‘The Tuesday mission marked China's first commercial application launch from sea,’ Jin Xin, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Long March-11 launch vehicle, told the Global Times on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The mission also helped to optimise seaborne launch procedures and improve the safety and reliability of such operations, laying a foundation for frequent sea-based launches in the future, said Jin.</p>

<p>The launch comes after China has failed to send its optical remote-sensing satellite Jilin-1 Gaofen 02C into its planned orbit on Saturday.</p>

<p>Last week, the nation also saw its Long March 4B rocket booster exploding into a massive cloud of orange smoke after crashing into a nearby town and narrowly missing a school.</p>
