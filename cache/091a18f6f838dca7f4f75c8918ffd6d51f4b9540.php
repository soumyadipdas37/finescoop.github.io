<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>We talk a lot about leading from the front in rugby but seeing guys like Joe Marler, Denny Solomona and Kearnan Myall speak so openly about their mental health is true leadership.</p>

<p>Most people only see the glamour side of professional sport. The trophies, the fun, the fancy posts on Instagram. But rugby players are normal humans with their own vulnerabilities. </p>

<p>Things like selection, injuries and social media scrutiny all bring their own anxieties. Clubs are a bit of a community and there is usually someone to talk to, but I think more needs to be done in the England camp. It's such a stressful environment. </p>

<p>It is very brave of rugby stars such as Denny Solomona to open up about their struggles</p>

<p>Joe Marler deserves credit for talking about his mental health - he showed great leadership</p>

<p>From the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep, you're worried about something: missing a meeting, knowing the calls, being physically ready, being mentally ready. I've had low points in camp — like the incident with Ben Te'o in Treviso — and I've felt like there hasn't been anyone to talk to.</p>

<p>Seeing these guys share their stories is important. The sport is gradually becoming more aware about mental health but there is still so much to do. It starts with guys like Joe, Denny and Kearnan.</p>

<p>Kearnan Myall is another rugby star who has been open about the struggles he has had</p>
