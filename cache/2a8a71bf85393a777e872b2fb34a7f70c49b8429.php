<p>'There is no particular alarm (in the Vatican)', but the health of the head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics was being 'constantly monitored,' he added.</p>

<p>Pope Francis, whose birth name is Jorge Bergoglio, has shown little fear for his own health since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic early this year.</p>

<p>The pope talks to those who visit him at the Apostolic Palace without wearing a face mask.  </p>

<p>Last week the pope removed his mask and reached out to touch the faithful, pictured above </p>

<p>Last week he was spotted wearing one for the first time since the start of the pandemic, but he took it off to chat to the faithful.</p>

<p>Francis shunned however his usual practice of shaking hands and kissing babies, and used hand sanitiser which was handed to him by a personal assistant.</p>

<p>The pope was tested for the coronavirus in March when a prelate living in the same residence as him was found to be positive.</p>
