<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fewer households are buying TV licences, according to the BBC's annual report. </p>

<p>Audiences for its major channels have also fallen, suggesting many families are relying on streaming services such as Netflix. </p>

<p>The Corporation said 25.9million licences were in force in 2019/20 – down 237,000 in a year. </p>

<p>With a licence costing £157.50, the fall cost the BBC just under £40million. The BBC lost millions more because the Government has started to reduce the amount of money it gives the Corporation to pay for free licences for the over-75s. </p>

<p>Fewer households are buying TV licences, according to the BBC's annual report, as families turn to Netflix</p>

<p>Overall licence fee revenue fell £170million to just over £3.5billion. </p>

<p>According to yesterday's report, younger people aged 16 to 34 watched or listened to just seven and a half hours of BBC content a week – only a slightly higher share than YouTube. </p>

<p>Across all ages, the audience reach of BBC1 – the numbers that see the channel each week – fell from 68 per cent to 65.4 per cent in a year. BBC2 also saw a decline, from 42.9 per cent to 41.9 per cent. </p>

<p>CBBC, CBeebies and BBC Four also saw falls while the only increases were on the BBC News channel and BBC Parliament. </p>

<p>Even among its most loyal viewers – the over-55s – audience reach across all BBC TV channels fell from 93 per cent to 92 per cent. </p>

<p>Among those aged 16 to 34, the proportion fell from 58 per cent to 55 per cent. Radio 1 saw its audience reach fall from 17 to 16.6 per cent and Radio 2 dropped from 27.2 per cent to 26 per cent. </p>

<p>The audience for Radio 4 was stable at 19.3 per cent and there were small rises at Radio 3 and 5 Live. </p>

<p>Just 49 per cent of 16 to 34-yearolds listen to BBC radio at least once a week – down from 51 per cent the year before. </p>

<p>The report said: 'Young adults watched 11 hours a week on all TV channels on average – decreasing around 75 minutes year on year. </p>

<p>'In contrast, the time they spent using the TV set for subscription video on demand, gaming, YouTube and other purposes increased – up to around 40 minutes per week to just over nine hours weekly on average.' </p>

<p>Together with 76 on-air talent staff, almost 200 staff at the BBC earn more than Boris Johnson</p>

<p>The annual report revealed a rise in the number of executives. The BBC now employs 253 senior managers – up from 250 the year before.</p>

<p>Of these, no fewer than 106 earn more than the Prime Minister's £150,000. </p>

<p>Together with 76 on-air talent staff, it means almost 200 staff at the BBC earn more than Boris Johnson. </p>

<p>The increases come despite huge pressure on the Corporation to cut down on management roles, which were lampooned in the BBC's own comedy W1A. </p>

<p>The report said new director general Tim Davie earned £642,000 last year as boss of BBC Studios, which is not funded by the licence fee. </p>

<p>He will be taking a pay cut. Total board and executive committee pay totalled £5.8million – up from £5.4million the previous year. </p>

<p>A BBC spokesman said last night: 'Some measures are not going in the right direction. Headcount has increased from 19,231 to 19,572 and senior leader numbers have gone up from 250 to 253. </p>

<p>'As the new director general has said, the BBC will keep a focus on cost reduction so that the public service headcount is smaller. </p>

<p>'The BBC also has to do more to better serve and reflect all licence fee payers. It is critical that the BBC gets this right.'</p>
