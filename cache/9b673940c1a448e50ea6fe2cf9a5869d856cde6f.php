<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England legend Peter Shilton claims that Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden have to be more aware of social media dangers and understand their responsibilities as professional footballers.</p>

<p>The England youngsters were axed from Gareth Southgate's squad after footage emerged of the pair bringing girls back to the team hotel in Iceland. Having made their senior international debuts together, the pair's accomplishments were quickly overshadowed. </p>

<p>Shilton, who represented England in three World Cups, says the youngsters will learn from this experience, while also admitting that he doesn't 'envy' the social traction of the 'modern-day footballer.'</p>

<p>Legend Peter Shilton has praised Gareth Southgate for his diplomacy amid the scandal</p>

<p> Mason Greenwood and Phil Foden were caught bringing girls to back to England's team hotel</p>

<p>Speaking on the Gary Newbon Sports Show, Shilton said Southgate has 'handled the situation off the pitch with diplomacy.'</p>

<p>The England manager, who confirmed the pair had been kicked out of the squad just hours after the footage had be released, described their behaviour as 'unacceptable on any basis'.  </p>

<p>After punishing the pair, Southgate did, however, say that he did not intent to 'hurt these boys any more' and will instead look to 'support' them.   </p>

<p>When asked if Southgate handled the situation well, Shilton said: 'I think so. There's not much else he could do really. Two young lads obviously made a mistake, and got punished for it.</p>

<p>‘Obviously, they got sent home. They'll learn from that, it's not good on their CV. Like a lot of things, time will erase that or diminish it and I'm sure they'll be in the fold in the future.' </p>

<p> England boss Southgate described the youngsters behaviour as 'unacceptable on any basis'</p>

<p>Shilton, who represented England in three World Cups, doesn't envy the modern footballer</p>

<p>Shilton, who hung up his gloves in 1997 after completing more than 1,000 professional matches, add that he is not jealous of the spotlight that modern footballers are in.</p>

<p>When asked if social media has changed things for players, Shilton said: 'I don't envy that about modern-day footballers. They can't really go anywhere or do anything. They should realise that.</p>

<p>‘They get very well-paid and they've got to understand their responsibilities.</p>

<p>‘With social media, it's very difficult. You can go out and have a pint somewhere and someone puts a video on and the next minute you've had 10 pints. Things get exaggerated.</p>

<p>‘I even go out sometimes and people are videoing me with my wife Steph – hopefully in a nice way.</p>

<p>‘With professional footballers, it's not quite the same.'</p>

<p>Shilton insists that footballers must understand their responsibilities as professionals</p>
