<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A husband shocked his wife after she told him to liven up their garden by installing a 12ft-tall replica of a T-Rex on the patio.</p>

<p>Adrian Shaw, 52, snapped up the 14-stone resin and fiberglass dinosaur and hired a crane to winch it into position on Thursday.</p>

<p>He came up with the idea after wife Deborah, 53, nagged him to clean up the back garden of their home in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire.</p>

<p>Adrian Shaw, 52, snapped up the 14-stone resin and fiberglass dinosaur and hired a crane to winch it into position on Thursday</p>

<p>Mr Shaw, an IT analyst, paid £1,600 for the replica, which he named 'Dave' and put it on the patio outside the kitchen door.</p>

<p>He said: 'This project is a result of my wife's request to make the garden look nice.</p>

<p>'She suggested I clear away the weeds and maybe put a gnome on the patio which got me thinking.</p>

<p>'I thought nothing could possibly look nicer in the garden than a 3.5 metre replica of a rampaging T-Rex, so I bought one.</p>

<p>'I guess that it is most people's dream to own a 3.5 metre replica of a rampaging T-Rex but they don't have the space or resources to do this.</p>

<p>Mr Shaw, an IT analyst, paid £1,600 for the replica, which he named 'Dave' and put it on the patio outside the kitchen door</p>

<p>'I have been very fortunate to be able to realise the dream.</p>

<p>'It only cost £1,600 from a company in Wales who said they could deliver it and I hired a crane to lift it into the garden.</p>

<p>'The neighbours loved it and took lots of pictures and I thought it looked great in the garden.'</p>

<p>The crane is seen above winching the 12ft replica into position</p>

<p>But wife Deborah, a school business manager, was unimpressed when she stumbled across the towering monster in the middle of the night.</p>

<p>Mr Shaw, who has been together with Deborah for 20 years and married for six, said: 'I thought my wife would be thrilled to bits but I don't think she was as enthusiastic as I'd expected her to be.</p>

<p>'She loves the Jurassic Park films and watches all the David Attenborough documentaries, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with the purchase really.</p>

<p>'She came home late from work and it was dark so I thought I'd surprise her with Dave the next morning when she opened the curtains.</p>

<p>'I'd even set up my camera to capture her reaction, which I was expecting to be one of sheer delight.</p>

<p>'Sadly, in the middle of the night the dog got up for a wee and when she opened the back door to let him out the security lights came on and she came face to face with the T-Rex.</p>

<p>'I could hear the screams and went running downstairs but even after the initial shock, she continued to scream.</p>

<p>'I've fallen in love with Dave though and he's not going anywhere. I'm sure Deborah will understand and grow to love him just as much as I do.'</p>
