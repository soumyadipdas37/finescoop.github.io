<p>'It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'After what will be 14 years, 20 seasons, hundreds of episodes and numerous spin-off shows, we are beyond grateful to all of you who've watched us for all of these years – through the good times, the bad times, the happiness, the tears, and the many relationships and children. We'll forever cherish the wonderful memories and countless people we've met along the way.' </p>
