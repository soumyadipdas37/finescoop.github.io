<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews faces a motion of no confidence in parliament over his handling of COVID-19.</p>

<p>The motion is expected to be tabled in the state's lower house on Thursday.</p>

<p>'I will be moving a motion of no confidence in this premier. Victorians have had enough,' Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said.</p>

<p>The premier brusquely dismissed the move when asked in his daily media conference.</p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured on Thursday) faces a motion of no confidence in parliament over his handling of COVID-19</p>

<p>'Cheap politics is no vaccine against this virus, and that is all I will say about him and that,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>Victoria has been hard hit by coronavirus, leading the nation's case numbers and deaths.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded another eight deaths on Thursday, taking the state's death toll to 745 and the national figure to 832. </p>

<p>Most of the deaths can be linked to Victoria's bungled hotel quarantine system, which is under investigation.</p>

<p>Strict lockdown measures designed to stem the spread of the virus have resulted in business closures and job losses.</p>

<p>'This is a government that has proven itself to be incompetent, dishonest and with no vision or hope for Victorians,' Liberal-Nationals leader Mr O'Brien said.</p>

<p>'By moving a motion of no confidence, every member of the legislative assembly will have to make a decision - are they going to vote to protect Daniel Andrews' job? Or are they going to vote to protect Victorians' jobs?'</p>

<p>Liberal MP James Newbury called Mr Andrews 'Premier Pinocchio' and claimed the Victorian leader had been caught in a lie.  </p>

<p>'For weeks, Daniel Andrews has claimed the federal government didn't offer Australian Defence Force support to run Victoria's hotel quarantine,' he said.</p>

<p>'Despite irrefutable proof, the premier is still denying the offer was made. Premier Pinocchio is a massive fibber with a very long nose'. </p>

<p>Labor has a clear majority in the lower house and Mr O'Brien's motion is not expected to pass.</p>

<p>It will be tabled on Thursday and debated next month.</p>
