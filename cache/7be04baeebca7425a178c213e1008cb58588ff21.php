<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rolls-Royce has partnered with aerospace firm Reaction Engines to create a propulsion system for a new supersonic business jet designed by Virgin Galactic. </p>

<p>Richard Branson-owned Virgin Galactic this month unveiled the plane's design that will fly up to 19 passengers at up to three times the speed of sound.</p>

<p>Reaction Engines, based in Oxfordshire, signed a £20 million partnership with Rolls-Royce that will include sharing of the technology. </p>

<p>If it goes ahead as planned, the cutting-edge plane will fly at more than 60,000 feet - twice as high as a traditional commercial plane - and complete a trip from London to New York in 90 minutes.</p>

<p>Reaction Engines employs 200 staff and has been researching next generation space propulsion systems since it was founded in 1988.</p>

<p>The sleek airplane is capable of shuttling nine to 19 passengers, while traveling at speeds of Mach 3 - three times faster than the speed of sound.</p>

<p>Virgin Galactic first revealed its plans for a supersonic jet earlier this year, by announcing a partnership with NASA.</p>

<p>Through this partnership, the craft design passes a mission concept review – it can 'meet the high-level requirements and objectives of the mission.'</p>

<p>Rolls-Royce is the main engine partner on the project but with work with Reaction Engines to create more efficient engines capable of such high speeds.</p>

<p>This will include using the firms thermal technology - designed to reduce the temperature of compressed air rushing into an engine from over 1,830 degrees Fahrenheit to room temperature in a 20th of a second.</p>

<p>They will integrate this technology into their gas turbine engine and hybrid-electric systems to make them more efficient while carrying larger payloads. </p>

<p>Reaction has a number of projects in development including a single-stage-to orbit space plane, and a number of hypersonic engine technologies.</p>

<p>Its Sabre engine is capable of operating at more than 2,500mph and combines a gas turbine with the properties of a rocket - its not known to what extent the sabre engine will be used by Rolls-Royce in the Virgin Galactic aircraft. </p>

<p>Mark Thomas, CEO of Reaction, told the Times that their technology was transformational - something completely recognised by Rolls-Royce.</p>

<p>'My assumption is they think there will be a battleground for technology on the other side of this pandemic,' he said when talking about the partnership. </p>

<p>The agreement between the two firms has been dubbed a 'strategic partnership' designed to investigate how designs by Reaction can help Rolls-Royce.</p>

<p>Thomas told the Telegraph: 'Our design has demonstrated cooling of 900C in less time than the blink of an eye. We can take air from temperature of molten lava to a level where you could comfortably stand in it.'  </p>

<p>He said the deal - which includes a further £20 million investment from Rolls-Royce which already holds a stake in the Oxfordshire firm - was an endorsement of their technology from one of the biggest players in the industry. </p>

<p>The craft is said to travel in altitudes of 60,000 feet and can be customized to fit customers' needs</p>

<p>George Whitesides, chief space officer, Virgin Galactic said, 'We are excited to complete the Mission Concept Review and unveil this initial design concept of a high speed aircraft, which we envision as blending safe and reliable commercial travel with an unrivaled customer experience.' </p>

<p>'We are pleased to collaborate with the innovative team at Rolls-Royce as we strive to develop sustainable, cutting-edge propulsion systems for the aircraft, and we are pleased to be working with the FAA to ensure our designs can make a practical impact from the start.'</p>

<p>'We have made great progress so far, and we look forward to opening up a new frontier in high speed travel.' </p>

<p>The firm is set to designed customized cabins to address customer needs, including business or first class seating arrangements.</p>

<p>Virgin Galactic is aiming to lead the way for of state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, the firm explained. </p>

<p>The aerospace company also announced a new partnership with Rolls-Royce to collaborate in designing and developing engine propulsion technology for the high speed commercial aircraft. The team is set to start the next design phase shortly</p>

<p>The Virgin Team continues to work on its aircraft and are gearing up to start the next phase of design - including specific system architectures.</p>

<p>They will also look at determining which materials to use in the design and manufacturing of the aircraft and its cabin.</p>

<p>Virgin designers will also work to address key challenges in thermal management, maintenance, noise, emissions, and economics that routine high speed commercial flights would entail.</p>

<p>Pricing for seats have not been revealed, but Virgin Galactic is selling spots on its tourist spaceplane - VSS Unity - for $250,000.</p>

<p>The deal between Rolls-Royce and Reaction could go beyond just the Virgin Galactic aircraft, according to Thomas.</p>

<p>Rolls has been working with Reaction Engines since 2018 after a contract by the Ministry of Defence asked them to investigate high-speed military aircraft.</p>

<p>The new move widens the arrangement to include civil aircraft including the new Virgin Galactic aircraft - with flights possible within a decade. </p>
