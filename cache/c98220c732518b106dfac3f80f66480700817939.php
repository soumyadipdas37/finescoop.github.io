<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Campaigners are trying to ban the use of the term 'Lycra louts' to describe speeding cyclists – and even stop the likes of Jeremy Clarkson poking fun at them.</p>

<p>Under proposed media guidelines, abuse of cyclists would be treated as a 'hate crime' and they would get the same protection as domestic violence victims and refugees.</p>

<p>Newspapers would also be gagged from stating if an injured cyclist was not wearing a helmet or high-vis clothing. </p>

<p>Instead, they would be urged to shame 'criminal' motorists for accidents involving bicycles.</p>

<p>The controversial media code is backed by Impress, a state-approved regulator funded indirectly by millionaire former Formula 1 boss Max Mosley's family charity. </p>

<p>Campaigners want to ban the use of the term 'Lycra louts' to describe speeding cyclists (file)</p>

<p>It regulates just over 100 media titles, mainly small hyper-local outlets or trade press.</p>

<p>The guidelines were drawn up by the University of Westminster, the National Union of Journalists, road safety charities and other experts.</p>

<p>They say the word 'accident' should be banned in reports of crashes – even though 'road traffic accident' is the legal term recognised by police and courts.</p>

<p>The report says cyclists are 'frustrated by road deaths being portrayed as unavoidable 'accidents' rather than by 'very avoidable criminal behaviour'. </p>

<p>It says: 'All traffic collisions involve some form of misjudgement by error or outright downright dangerous action by one or more drivers.'</p>

<p>The move was criticised last night. Howard Cox, founder of FairFuelUK, which campaigns for motorists, said: 'Motorists will be repulsed that militant, urban-based cyclists want drivers to take the blame in any report of an accident. </p>

<p>The term 'Lycra lout' was coined to describe cyclists who race through red lights or speed along pavements - and Jeremy Clarkson (file picture) has often vented his fury at them</p>

<p>'It is the latest attempt to re-write the road-user handbook by the Lycra-clad liberal elite. They are not interested in being fair. Now they want to muzzle the Press in their continuing hatred of motorists.'</p>

<p>The term 'Lycra lout' was coined to describe cyclists who race through red lights or speed along pavements. Jeremy Clarkson has often vented his fury at them. </p>

<p>In 2014 he tweeted a photo of a cyclist whose face was 'twisted into a contorted mask of pure fury' after the TV presenter overtook him. </p>

<p>The former Top Gear host said he was 'amused' by the cyclist's rage. It prompted BBC Radio 2 host Jeremy Vine, a keen cyclist, to call Clarkson a 'muppet'.</p>

<p>The guidelines follow a boom in cycling. Many town hall chiefs have used the pandemic to create extra cycle lanes, leading to complaints of traffic chaos.</p>

<p>The 'Road Collision Reporting Guidelines' say cyclists are 'dehumanised' by media coverage which is in favour of speeding motorists. When a cyclist was in an accident with a car, the media should state they had been 'hit by a driver, not a car'. </p>

<p>The report also questions the use of the word 'cyclist' itself, arguing it 'can engender negative connotations'. </p>

<p>Under the code, cyclists who claim they have been insulted will be able to make formal complaints on the grounds that it 'provoked hatred'.</p>

<p>The report was written by Westminster University 'Active Travel Academy', including Laura Laker, who writes on cycling for The Guardian, and Adam Tranter, the 'bicycle mayor for Coventry'.</p>
