<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Retail sales are growing at their fastest rate in 18 months thanks to a boom in spending on food and the home, a survey has revealed.</p>

<p>Families are spending more on household furniture and DIY as renewed lockdown measures force them back indoors, the CBI monthly Distributive Trades Survey found.</p>

<p>But fashion and department stores are still struggling, the business lobby group's survey of 56 retailers found, and bosses fear the latest restrictions and a fresh wave of joblessness could derail the fragile recovery.</p>

<p>Pets at Home, which runs pet stores, vets and grooming parlours, reported 'double-digit' growth, thanks to families spending more pampering their pets. Shares jumped 27.8 per cent</p>

<p>Yesterday DFS said lockdown had sparked a 'nesting instinct' leading to a surge in sales of beds, sofas and furniture. It recorded an extra £226million of sales in the last ten weeks, helped also by pent-up demand.</p>

<p>Pets at Home, which runs pet stores, vets and grooming parlours, reported 'double-digit' growth, thanks to families spending more pampering their pets. Its shares jumped by 27.8 per cent.</p>

<p>The CBI said the latest figures were a stark reminder of the 'winners and losers' in retail. </p>

<p>Sales of household furniture were 39 per cent higher than normal in September, DIY and hardware sales were up a fifth and groceries were up a tenth. </p>

<p>But sales of clothing were down 40 per cent and department store sales were down by 23 per cent compared to a normal month.</p>

<p>Overall sales are 8 per cent lower than they would have been without the pandemic, and retailers expect the recovery to plateau in October. </p>

<p>Ben Jones, CBI principal economist, said: 'With social distancing measures tightening again, those working in the hardest-hit sectors will be fearing the worst.'</p>

<p>The Office of National Statistics said retail sales increased by 0.8 per cent in August, the fourth consecutive month of growth.</p>

<p>DFS is the latest homeware store to report booming sales in recent months. Sales in the year to the end of June fell 27.2 per cent to £724.5million due to a temporary pause on deliveries during lockdown</p>

<p>But chief executive Tim Stacey said: 'Customers are shifting their spend towards home against travel, leisure and fashion. We're in that sweet spot of the importance of home and the nesting instinct ahead of autumn.'</p>
