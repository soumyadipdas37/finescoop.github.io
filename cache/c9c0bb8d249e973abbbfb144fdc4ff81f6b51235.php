<p>Lucie styled her platinum blonde locks into an updo while her beau Luke M, 24, looked dapper in a houndstooth blazer with matching trousers and a white shirt. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Siannise cut a glamorous figure for the evening in a skintight white minidress with a deep v-neckline.</p>

<p>The TV star, 25, wore a pair of nude heels and carried a bejewelled handbag while she let her raven tresses fall loose down her shoulders. </p>

<p>Luke and Lucie sported matching wetsuits as they put on a cosy display in the image uploaded to the hunk's platform, which he captioned: 'My partner in crime.'</p>

<p>The surfer commented: 'Youuuu' with a heart-eyed emoji, while fellow Love Islander Luke Trotman, who confirmed the pair's romance days earlier, cheekily wrote: 'Double date but no surfing.' (sic)</p>

<p>Just hours after going Instagram official, the Luke's ex-girlfriend Demi Jones – who he was partnered up with on Love Island's winter 2020 series – appeared to make a thinly-veiled dig at her co-star as she liked a tweet about being 'better off alone'.</p>
