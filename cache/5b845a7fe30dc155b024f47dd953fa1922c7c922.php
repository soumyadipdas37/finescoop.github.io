<p>Once Bob arrived at the veterinary clinic on the campus of the University of Florida - home of the Gators football team - he was placed on a gurney and tightly secured with straps, allowing staff to wheel him in for radiographs, reported CBS Miami. </p>

<p>Officials with UF veterinary medicine said the tests have determined that Bob has a bone infection called osteomyelitis.</p>

<p>The middle-aged reptile has been prescribed pain relief medications and antibiotics for the infection, which zookeepers on the alligator farm have been administering to him inside dead rats. </p>

<p>'For me, it’s a great pleasure and a great privilege to be able to work on these animals,' Darryl Heard, UF associate professor of zoological medicine, told WCJB. 'In particular such a large animal and also to be able to work with them safely.'  </p>
