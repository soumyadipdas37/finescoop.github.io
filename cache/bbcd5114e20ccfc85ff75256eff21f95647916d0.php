<p>Biologists with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission captured three Suwannee alligator snapping turtles last week, including one that weighed 100 pounds.</p>

<p>The massive reptiles, known formally as Macrochelys suwanniensis, are a new species, according to a post on the FWC Facebook page. </p>

<p>The 100-pound male and a 46-pound female were found in a hoop net trap in the New River, north of Gainesville, along with another 64-pound male found in a trap. nearby. </p>

<p>The commission has been studying these prehistoric-looking creatures since 2014.    </p>

<p>Researchers estimate that the trio is anywhere from 40 and 80 years old. </p>

<p>Once the three turtles had their photograph taken and vital stats recorded, they were released back into the river.</p>

<p>'The New River is a blackwater stream with low biological productivity, so finding a large turtle in such a small stream is unusual,' the agency said. </p>

<p>The FWC has been collaborating with researchers in Florida and Georgia to study the population size and distribution of Suwannee alligator snapping turtles, which is indigenous to the area. </p>

<p>Previously, it was believed there was only one living species of alligator snapping turtle.</p>

<p>A third species, the Apalachicola snapping turtle, has been proposed but is not widely recognized.</p>

<p>Alligator snapping turtles are the largest freshwater turtles in North America.</p>

<p>Despite its name, they're not closely related to the common snapping turtle, which is in a different genus.</p>

<p>Despite their names, the alligator snapping turtle is not closely related to the common snapping turtle, which is in a different genus. With a beaklike jaw, spiked shell and scaly, thick tail, it's been called 'the dinosaur of the turtle world'</p>

<p>It's name is derived from the ridges on its shell that resemble the rough skin of an alligator. </p>

<p>With a beaklike jaw, spiked shell and scaly, thick tail, it's also been dubbed 'the dinosaur of the turtle world.'</p>

<p>They spend most of their lives in rivers and canals, except when the female crawls ashore, and can stay underwater for 40 to 50 before surfacing for air.</p>

<p>Most live to about 70, though there have been reports of alligator snapping turtles living to 100.</p>

<p>Males alligator snapping turtles weigh about 175 pounds, according to National Geographic, although they can surpass 200 pounds.  </p>

<p>Females are much smaller, usually weighing under 50lbs.</p>

<p>Scientists are particularly concerned about the Suwannee because of its limited habitat. 'All it has is this river and it has nowhere else to go.'</p>

<p>Beyond their bizarre appearance, alligator snapping turtles have a truly unique hunting technique. They uses a bright pink chunk of flesh on their tongues like a lure, drawing in curious fish and frogs.</p>

<p>Once its prey gets in range, the previously motionless reptile snaps its jaw shut.</p>

<p>With their size and natural defenses, alligator snapping turtles have no natural predators except for humans, who hunt them for their meat and shells.</p>

<p>The turtles' numbers have declined precipitously in recent years due to unregulated harvesting and habitat loss.</p>

<p>Scientists are particularly concerned about the Suwannee because of its limited habitat.</p>

<p>'If something catastrophic were to occur, such as a chemical spill or something that affects the entire river, it could potentially devastate this species,' Travis Thomas, a FWC scientist said in 2014. 'All it has is this river and it has nowhere else to go.' </p>
