<p>'It's just a hormonal surge,' the 45-year-old New Englander explained to WSJ. Magazine on Monday.</p>

<p>'There's this big push because you're so exhausted. Your body exudes this crazy oxytocin love hormone where you just feel like you're high. That was really fun. I was like, "I would do this again, just for this high!"'  </p>

<p>Chloë feels 'lucky' that her fiancé Siniša Mackovic 'helps all of the time' because he's 'been home from work,' and her mother Janine 'coming and helping us a few times a week for a few hours.'</p>

<p>'I'm usually really good at time management. I'm actually really proud of how I get everything done in a day,' Sevigny beamed.</p>

<p>'I keep lists, and I'm very organized. Since I've had the baby, I'm just like, I don't know how anybody gets anything done. I have to cook for everyone, then clean, then feed him, then clean him.'</p>

<p>The nineties It Girl is famed for her eccentric style - but these days that involves Adidas shorts, Birkenstocks, Ugg slippers, and 'button-downs because you also need to access your boobs a lot for pumping and feeding.' </p>

<p>'I'm very girl-centric!' The nineties It Girl always dreamed of having a daughter to inherit her clothing collection, so it was an adjustment for her to wrap her head around having a son instead (pictured June 28) </p>

<p>'You can't really get away with the extra middle weight,' Chloë lamented.</p>

<p>'I'm doing some Zoom Pilates classes and going on walks and trying to diet but not diet...I have these really chic Charvet slippers I get in Paris, and I couldn't even fit in those slippers. It's not pretty over here.'</p>

<p>Premieres September 14 on HBO! Chloë was in the midst of her 'crazy first trimester' when she shot her role as soldier Sarah Wilson in Luca Guadagnino's eight-episode miniseries We Are Who We Are</p>

<p>Sevigny recalled: 'I was around so much boy energy, and I didn't know what I was going to have at the time. But on set I kept thinking, "What if I have a kid like this kid [Jack Dylan Grazer]? First of all, he's brilliant, so that would be great; but secondly, he has so much energy"'</p>

<p>'Working with the boy who plays my [16-year-old] son, Jack Dylan Grazer - he's a prodigy. He's very energetic. I was around so much boy energy, and I didn't know what I was going to have at the time,' Sevigny recalled.</p>

<p>'But on set I kept thinking, "What if I have a kid like this kid Jack? First of all, he's brilliant, so that would be great; but secondly, he has so much energy." It was a lot of meditating on that one.' </p>
