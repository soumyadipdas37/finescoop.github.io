<p>James and Imogen met when they co-starred in West End production BelleVille at the Donmar Warehouse, in 2017.</p>

<p>His ex confessed that their break-up was 'acrimonious’ – putting it down partly to the difficulty of dating a fellow actor.</p>

<p>'We have broken up, yes,’ she said. ‘It was acrimonious, but it’s a tough job to have a relationship and he is a great man and we are great friends. That’s it. How diplomatic can I sound?’</p>

<p>Explaining the break-up, Jemma told The Times: ‘If you are away for a year filming, you are just not physically around at points.’ </p>
