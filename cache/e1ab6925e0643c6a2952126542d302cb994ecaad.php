<p>Stunner: Eliza Doolittle proved she still has all the makings of a pop star as she posed up a storm during a photoshoot in London on Wednesday</p>

<p>Eliza was making the most of her stunning frame as she donned a neon yellow mini skirt beneath a pinstripe blazer and paired with boots.</p>

<p>She opted to forego wearing a top underneath the blazer, meaning her bare chest was on full display while the blazer also nipped in at her waist.</p>

<p>Despite the descending chill in the capital, she went bared-legged in the ensemble while donning a pair of tartan print ankle boots. </p>

<p>In a nod to the bang on-trend clashing patterns style, the red tartan in her boots clashed against the pinstripe while the neon stood out boldly. </p>

<p>Her glowing complexion stole the show as she went for an extremely natural make-up look to make the most of her pretty features.  </p>

<p>Eliza shot to fame with debut single Skinny Genes in April 2010, which was quickly followed by UK top 5 hit Pack Up. </p>

<p>It was really fun and exciting, you know; we were hustling, we were doing this pop thing. But, I always found myself coming head to head with them, and feeling like I wasn’t being true to myself in one way or another...</p>

<p>'In the end it wasn’t for me, I’m too controlling, and I want to be able to make music the way I want to do it.' </p>
