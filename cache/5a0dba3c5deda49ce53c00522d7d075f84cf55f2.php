<p>And now Ben Fordham has revealed he's 'blown away' by the sensational results, while praising his predecessor in a touching interview.</p>

<p>Over the moon! Ben Fordham (pictured)  has revealed he's 'blown away' by the sensational results, while praising his predecessor in a touching interview</p>

<p>The host was quick to praise the 'incredible record of Alan Jones', who retired earlier in the year after 35 years as a broadcaster.</p>

<p>'No other broadcaster has achieved what he achieved, and so that is why I am blown away by the loyalty shown to me by the audience,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don’t underestimate for a moment the significance of Alan Jones leaving the building.'</p>

<p>Big boots to fill: Fordham praised his predecessor Alan Jones (pictured) saying 'I don’t underestimate for a moment the significance of Alan Jones leaving the building'</p>

<p>Proving himself a formidable replacement for his predecessor, Fordham's breakfast show won the AM breakfast slot with 17.3 per cent in the first survey since Jones' departure - a number almost identical to Jones' last survey results of 17.9 per cent.</p>

<p>2GB enjoys a market-leading 14.2 per cent share overall, which is slightly down from 14.8 per cent in April.</p>

<p>It has been previously speculated that ABC Breakfast with Wendy Harmer and Robbie Buck would take the top spot.</p>

<p>However, the show came in second place with 10.5 per cent market share overall.</p>

<p>Fordham had reportedly been under pressure to produce good ratings after critics claimed he was 'too nice and relaxed' to fill famously fiery Jones' shoes.</p>

<p>However, the Channel Nine star previously told The Australian that he wasn't trying to emulate Jones' style, but rather 'bring his own flavour of breakfast to the radio.'</p>

<p>'My main focus is going to be what's on the mind of people as they wake up in Sydney, and that needs to really drive my agenda every day,' he told the publication in June.</p>

<p>The ratings also revealed that Kyle and Jackie O is still Sydney's most popular FM breakfast show, topping the rankings for the fourteenth time. </p>
