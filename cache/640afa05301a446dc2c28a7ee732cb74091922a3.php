<p>'Look, I think it would have been lovely if Locky had reached out. It just would have been nice,' Bella began.</p>

<p>'But at the same time, I think the closure in itself was just being aware of the fact that I deserve to find someone that knows they love me and knows they want to be with me,' she continued.</p>

<p>Bella added that there's no bad blood between herself and Irena, and is hoping that she will find her own happily ever after soon.  </p>

<p>Tears: Locky burst into tears and gasped for air as he delivered the bad news to Bella, saying he needed 'more certainty' in a relationship</p>

<p>'Like, they just make me go crazy. And when I told you I love you, I meant every single word.  </p>

<p>'I know you don't sort of see where your future is at the moment. I think I need just a little bit of certainty.' </p>

<p>Upon hearing the news, Bella looked at Locky - who had declared his love for her a day earlier - in utter disbelief. </p>

<p>Heartbroken: Bella was left devastated from the crippling blow </p>

<p>'I just don't know if I can see us working,' he added.</p>

<p>'I just don't get it. Yesterday, you told me you were in love with me,' she said in shock. </p>

<p>After he responded by saying he was in love with her, Bella added: 'Well, why not follow through with a relationship, then?' </p>

<p>Horrified: Bella swiftly ran away from Locky, who was still tearful as she left him on his own</p>

<p>He went on: 'Because I asked you in the pool "What do you see our next year looking like?" And you were so... I needed a little bit more.'</p>

<p>Furiously, she responded: 'You can't turn this around on me.'</p>

<p>She then stormed off, stating: 'My God... Can I leave. I'm going.' </p>

<p>Heartbroken: Bella then ran away in tears, shaking over what had just happened</p>
