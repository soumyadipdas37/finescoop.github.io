<p>Idea: EastEnders star Cheryl Fergison has admitted she has thought of a way she could return to the soap, despite feeling as though she has 'moved on'</p>

<p>She said: 'I had this idea when they took me out of it that they could bring back Heather's long lost twin. </p>

<p>'I thought I could come back as Heather's long lot twin as the same actress. It didn’t happen and you know what, I live up north now so it's the cobbles or the dales.'</p>

<p>Looking back at her time in Albert Square, Cheryl said: 'Great memories, great times, but they were a long time ago it’s all about moving on now, it was a long time ago but great memories.'</p>

<p>Return? Speaking on Monday's episode of Loose Women, Cheryl told how she has thought the show could use the classic soap storyline of a long lost twin to bring her back</p>

<p>The star said: 'As actors we are chameleons are we not, I’m lucky and blessed to say I’m musical I play lots of instruments.</p>

<p>'I love singing I love acting. Over lockdown I loved presenting and singing, doing interviews with people. </p>

<p>'I play guitar, I love Ed and Lewis songs and I write songs myself, I’ve never gone into a studio, nobody has asked me to do so...I’d love to have a record just with my music on but maybe with collaborations with people. </p>

<p>'I don’t think people would expect me to be with the likes of Ed and Lewis. I want to do more of it because I love it...'</p>

<p>She said: 'I thought I could come back as Heather's long lot twin as the same actress. It didn’t happen and you know what, I live up north now so it's the cobbles or the dales'</p>

<p>It comes after Cheryl revealed she would be open to joining the cast of Coronation Street in the future. </p>

<p>Cheryl lives in the North West with her husband Yassine Al-Jermoni, 34, who she tied the knot with in 2011 after he moved to the UK to be with her.</p>

<p>Discussing a potential career move, Cheryl told the Distinct Nostalgia podcast: 'I would totally contemplate doing Corrie and given now that I live up North and talk like that now. I am like "Hiya love".' </p>

<p>Role: The actress, 55, portrayed Heather Trott on the BBC soap from 2007 to 2012 when she was killed by Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe)</p>

<p>Cheryl previously revealed that she burst into tears after being told she was out of EastEnders.  </p>

<p>She told Best magazine: 'It was a bittersweet day. What you get with one hand, you get taken away with another!</p>

<p>'When they told me Heather was for the chop, (the boss) had to get me a tissue. Sometimes a character is sacrificed to make other stories work. I get it. I knew it was going to come but it was still a shock.'</p>
