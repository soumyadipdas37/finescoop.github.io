<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jack Wilshere has sent a message to fans amid reports he could cancel his £100,000-a-week contract at West Ham. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old has 10 months left to run on his current deal and the club are looking to cut that short as they plan to funnel any spare funds into transfers. </p>

<p>In the meantime, Wilshere insists he has continued to 'work hard' in pre-season and has taken to Instagram to reassure Hammers fans of his commitment to the club.</p>

<p>Jack Wilshere has broken his silence amid reports his West Ham contract will be cancelled</p>

<p>He posted: 'Work hard in silence and be ready for whatever happens next.' </p>

<p>The former Arsenal star joined the club in 2018 as a free agent on a lucrative three-year contract, but injuries have limited hiim to just 18 appearances.</p>

<p>Wilshere admitted earlier this year that his time at West Ham has been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Talking to Stadium Astro, he said: 'It hasn't worked out for me, I'll be honest. It hasn't gone the way I wanted it to, I've missed too much football, I haven't played enough games.</p>

<p>Wilshere featured in West Ham's 2-1 pre-season victory over Brentford last month</p>

<p>Manager David Moyes (left) is desperate to raise extra funds to use in the transfer market</p>

<p>'I want to get back on track, get my career back on track, get playing games week-in, week-out and start to feel like a footballer again.'</p>

<p>West Ham had hoped to sell the former England international but with no offers forthcoming they are now prepared to reach a compromise agreement with Wilshere to release him.</p>

<p>The Hammers saw an offer offer of up to £28million for Burnley's James Tarkowski rejected on Thursday and are contemplating whether to go back again or move on to other options. </p>

<p>The controversial sale of Grady Diangana to West Brom has helped raise funds for David Moyes, who is determined to sign a centre-back and full-back before the transfer window closes on 5 October.</p>
