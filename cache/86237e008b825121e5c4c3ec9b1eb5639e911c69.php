<p>The troupe were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown.</p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together.</p>

<p>'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.</p>

<p>'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'</p>

<p>Happy 18th Birthday Lila, we love you¿¿¿¿</p>
