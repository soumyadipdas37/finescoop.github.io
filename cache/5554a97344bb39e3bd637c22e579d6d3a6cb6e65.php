<p>Sue Ellson, from Melbourne, told FEMAIL in order to get ahead at work, it's important to be open-minded, positive, social and to not be afraid to ask for a promotion.</p>

<p>Sue Ellson (pictured) outlined the five personality traits that may jeopardise employees from succeeding in the workplace</p>

<p>Whereas those who are pessimistic, apologise too much and resist change often fall behind. </p>

<p>The pessimist</p>

<p>Individuals who are pessimistic have a negative outlook on life and always think of the worst aspect or outcome.</p>

<p>Sue said these individuals are more likely to decline offers, not attend social events and make excuses.</p>

<p>'Pessimists have a tendency to whinge and make excuses, which often reflects badly on them at work and in the eyes of the employer,' she said.</p>

<p>'They never see the good side, always the bad side - and if anything changes too quickly, they will complain.'</p>

<p>Others in the office or at the workplace usually don't prefer this negative thinking and prefer those who are open-minded and positive. </p>

<p>The hothead</p>

<p>Someone who is hot-headed often has a temper or has little control over their emotions.</p>

<p>While it's acceptable for everyone to have some bad days, regular hot-tempered behaviour is not desired at work as it may make others feel uncomfortable or anxious, Sue said.</p>

<p>'A hothead can become unpredictable and deemed unreliable by bosses as they often can't control their emotions, which may lead to missed work opportunities,' Sue said.  </p>

<p>Regular hot-tempered behaviour is often not desired at work as it may make others feel uncomfortable or anxious, Sue said</p>

<p>The bully</p>

<p>On the other end of the spectrum, some workers might use destructive behaviour to bully others into fear and climb the workplace ladder themselves.</p>

<p>'Initially a bully can go unnoticed by those in leadership, but are eventually found out,' Sue said.</p>

<p>'Quite often with a bully, they conduct the behaviour out of vision of those in power.</p>

<p>'From a leadership perspective, you need to be able to identify a bully and investigate why, as this behaviour is  unacceptable,' she said. </p>

<p>Not speaking up and voicing your opinion during meetings or at work </p>

<p>Not asking for what you want and avoid asking for a promotion </p>

<p>Focusing on what your weaknesses are rather than strengths and skills </p>

<p>Telling yourself 'I can't', 'I won't' or 'maybe another time' rather than 'I will'   </p>

<p>Lacking self confidence and clarity of what you want to achieve </p>

<p>Doubting yourself </p>

<p>Not controlling anxious feelings </p>

<p>Avoid seeking help from others</p>

<p>Never taking action and stepping out of your comfort zone </p>

<p>Fearing failure </p>

<p>The change resistor</p>

<p>Workers who resist change usually prefer structure, order and routine, but great improvements can be jeopardised through this thinking.</p>

<p>'Young people are more likely to be open minded than older people who have more experience - but those who rely on years or decades of experience risk relying on outdating methods,' Sue said.</p>

<p>She added it's important to strive to learn something new every day or week to develop new skills, acquire knowledge and understand new ways of thinking.</p>

<p>A greater understanding of product or industry knowledge can help boost an individual's likelihood of getting promoted at work. </p>

<p>The apologiser</p>

<p>Sue said there are a few things to consider when an individual apologises too much - including their cultural background and their amount of experience or knowledge.</p>

<p>But someone who apologises repeatedly for no reason and uses terms such as 'sorry to bother you' or 'sorry about that' may take longer to excel at work.  </p>

<p>Luckily this trait or habit is easier to break compared to other traits.</p>
