<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rodents, dead cockroaches and live weevils were the horrifying finds made by council officers in the kitchen and storage room of a beloved bakery.</p>

<p>The Baked to Perfection bakery at Clayfield in Brisbane's inner-north was fined $16,000 on Thursday after a council officer spotted a live mouse running through the kitchen in January last year.</p>

<p>Two more dead rodents were found on a food shelf, live weevils were found in flour no longer being used and dead cockroaches were also spotted.</p>

<p>Kevin Kielly, the director who has run the well loved bakery for more than 50 years, was also fined $2,000.</p>

<p>The Baked to Perfection bakery at Clayfield in Brisbane was fined $16,000 on Thursday after a council officer spotted a live mouse running through the kitchen in January last year</p>

<p>Both the bakery and Mr Kielly pleaded guilty to nine charges each including offences relating to cleanliness and the presence of pests, the Courier Mail reported.</p>

<p>Rodent faeces were also spotted across the floor of the bakery that often catered to school and community events.</p>

<p>The Brisbane Magistrates Court heard on Friday that Mr Kielly had worked to fix the cleanliness issues within 24 hours and introduced better pest control management. </p>

<p>Liza Marshall, who represented Mr Kielly, said he had been struggling since the death of his wife in March and his son who died in 2017 due to a brain tumour.</p>

<p>Mr Kielly had relied on his wife's nursing job financially and the bakery only made $11,686 in profit last financial year, Ms Marshall said.</p>

<p>The bakery forked out around $250,000 in staff and other expenses and Mr Kielly did not make a wage.</p>

<p>'It's a little local business that engages with and supports the community, including the local schools and the swimming club,' Ms Marshall said. </p>

<p>Mr Kielly acknowledged that there were also holes in the bakery's ceiling which could have allowed for rodents to crawl inside.</p>

<p>The bakery which had never received a food complaint also provided discounted cakes to the local schools.</p>

<p>Magistrate Tina Previtera ordered Mr Kielly to pay $713 to the council but no convictions were recorded.</p>
