<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex 'plotted' their Netflix deal before their wedding because they would never have got it without his family name, it was claimed today.</p>

<p>Royal biographer Angela Levin also said that the $150million (£112million) deal was 'the biggest exploitation of the Royal Family that has been in our lifetime'.</p>

<p>Her comments on True Royalty TV come after Prince Harry and Meghan announced their Netflix deal on Wednesday by saying they planned to create programmes that 'inform but also give hope' and make 'impactful content that unlocks action'.</p>

<p>The couple, who are now living in Los Angeles, are expected to concentrate on behind-the-camera roles as producers rather than necessarily star themselves.</p>

<p>But Ms Levin, who wrote Harry: Conversations with the Prince in 2018, said: 'This is the biggest exploitation of the Royal Family that has been in our lifetime.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan leave St George's Chapel in Windsor after their wedding on May 19, 2018</p>

<p>'I think this was plotted right from the beginning, before the wedding even. Meghan has used the Royal Family and Harry to go from being a C-lister to one of the most famous and richest women in the world.'</p>

<p>Also speaking to True Royalty TV's weekly programme The Royal Beat, which is available online from tomorrow, was royal commentator Duncan Larcombe.</p>

<p>Mr Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story, said: 'There isn't a soul on the planet that would think that they got that job with that many zeros in the salary for any other reason than their association with the British Royal Family.</p>

<p>'They wouldn't have got a deal if it wasn't for their position. They owe their success to the fact that they have been public property.'</p>

<p>'Without Harry she was a pretty average actress on an American show that hardly anyone in Britain had heard of. Now she is enjoying a position higher than the Pope.'</p>

<p>Mr Larcombe added that the agreement with Netflix means that the couple might now never return to the UK or be part of the Royal Family again. </p>

<p>Royal commentator Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story, told the True Royalty TV programme: 'They wouldn't have got a deal if it wasn't for their position'</p>

<p>He said: 'The Netflix deal is by far and away the biggest development in Harry and Meghan breaking their ties with the British Royal Family.</p>

<p>'It is inconceivable that Meghan and Harry will come back to the UK and possibly make it impossible to ever return to the UK.'</p>

<p>'The Palace have been sideswiped by this. Harry didn't get on the phone to the Queen about the Netflix deal, it was news to her. That is an astonishing departure and shows that Harry is going to do what he wants on his terms.'</p>

<p>Speaking about Harry's recent zoom call with the Rugby Football League, Ms Levin added: 'He looks terribly unhappy. Harry used to sparkle.</p>

<p>'He was so lively, he would make you feel energised, like as if you have taken an energy pill. There it's all words, he deflects the question which means he doesn't want to answer it.'</p>

<p>She also revealed that the royals love watching Netflix drama The Crown, saying: 'When I saw Harry he asked me if I watched the Crown.</p>

<p>'He said that all the royal family love it. However, he said he is not going to let them do him - he said 'it has to stop before me'.'</p>

<p>Prince Harry is being urged to get a Netflix musical about his mother pulled, days after he signed a huge deal with the streaming service.</p>

<p>Netflix will screen the controversial musical, named 'Diana: A New Musical', which features a fictitious scene where the Queen labels her a 'tart'.</p>

<p>Other controversial lines include the Queen saying to Diana: 'In the old days we would have chopped off your head,' while another scene sees Diana in bed with James Hewitt.</p>

<p>Now a former bodyguard of the late princess is calling on her son to get the musical pulled from the streaming service.</p>

<p>Ken Wharfe, 72, Diana's former bodyguard, The Sun: 'The Diana musical, soon to be premiered on Netflix, presents a huge dilemma to them both.</p>

<p>'If the critics are to be believed, this musical story is not a joyous journey of love with a happy ending but an episodic account of untruths, scandal and sex.</p>

<p>'He now has the chance, irrespective of his lucrative deal with Netflix, to stand alone from his wife and make clear his abhorrence of such a musical and call Netflix to account.'</p>

<p>The musical began previews in March but never officially made its debut on Broadway due to the coronavirus pandemic. In an unconventional step, the musical is set to skip Broadway and go straight on to Netflix.</p>

<p>The cast and crew are set to reunite in an empty theatre this month to perform the musical for cameras and put the finished product on the digital platform for broadcast next year, before the show welcomes a live audience again.</p>

<p>It comes as royal insiders said yesterday that Harry and Meghan will have to prove their Netflix deal does not embarrass the Queen.</p>

<p>The couple had promised the sovereign in January that their commercial careers would not bring the monarchy into disrepute and vowed there would be 'no dodgy deals'.</p>

<p>Yesterday one royal source said: 'The proof is now in the pudding.'</p>

<p>As the Duke and Duchess embark on their money-spinning venture to make films for the global TV streaming giant, experts said they would also be under pressure to prove their right-on agenda can attract viewers.</p>

<p>Industry sources said the ideas the couple had been touting around Hollywood included making films about poverty and disability.</p>

<p>Experts said Netflix would want to keep the couple on a tight leash to ensure ratings.</p>

<p>Tom Harrington, a broadcast industry expert at Enders Analysis, said: 'The Sussexes may imagine they will dictate the shows they want to make, but Netflix will have a firm hand on the tiller.'</p>

<p>Netflix, which makes the hit series The Crown and has 193million subscribers worldwide, is the world's most valuable entertainment company.</p>

<p>The amount it is paying the royal couple has not been disclosed but sources said their representatives had been looking for around $100million (£75million) over several years, despite their lack of production experience.</p>

<p>The cash will enable Harry and Meghan to become financially independent – their stated aim when stepping down as senior royals in January.</p>

<p>Their first year abroad – they splashed out on a £11million mansion in California in June - has been partly funded by Prince Charles.</p>

<p>Yesterday there was no strong reaction from the royals to the Netflix announcement, with one palace insider saying: 'It was entirely expected.'</p>

<p>Public relations expert Mark Borowski said there would be a lot of pressure on the couple to make the Netflix venture a success.</p>

<p>He said: 'When you switch on the hype machine, you have got to deliver. If it's something that lets people down, it's going to backfire.' </p>

<p>A spokesman for the Duke and Duchess was contacted for comment by MailOnline today on the claims over when the Netflix deal was planned.</p>

<p>True Royalty TV is available on Apple TV, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google Play, Roku, Xfinity, Cox Contour and Sling platforms, as well as via its website here</p>

<p>A former Lib Dem MP has called on The Duke and Duchess of Sussex to pay back money for renovation work on their Windsor home.</p>

<p>Former Lib Dem MP Norman Baker says the couple should offer to pay the £2.4million they owe for the extensive renovation to Frogmore after signing a multimillion-pound deal with Netflix this week.</p>

<p>The house was extensively renovated for the couple after their marriage in May 2018, with the intention of it being a family home for son Archie.</p>

<p>But they have since left to live in America, where they have purchased a £14.7million mansion in California.</p>

<p>The house was extensively renovated for the couple after their marriage in May 2018, with the intention of it being a family home for son Archie</p>

<p>Mr Baker says they should offer to stump up the full sum after their recent deal with Netflix</p>

<p>As part of their 'exit package', often referred to as 'Megxit', the couple offered to refund the cost of building work at their UK family home paid for by the Sovereign Grant, money given by the Government to the Queen.</p>

<p>It is believed they will pay back around £18,000 a month, which will take them 11 years to clear. </p>

<p>But Mr Baker says they should offer to stump up the full sum after their recent deal with Netflix.</p>

<p>He told The Sun: 'They should pay the taxpayer back immediately for Frogmore renovations rather than wait eleven years.</p>

<p>'They can both definitely afford it. They should either pay it when the Netflix money arrives or give up the cottage.'   </p>
