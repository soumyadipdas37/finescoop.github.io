<p>A driver was caught on camera accelerating toward two men before knocking them to the ground during a vicious broad daylight brawl in a Kroger car park</p>

<p>In the clip, a large group of people can be heard arguing as two men in particular, one in a grey T-shirt and black shorts and the other in a white vest top and gray trousers, shout insults at each other across the car park. </p>

<p>The camera pans round to focus on two women who have started grappling and pulling each other's hair in front of a red car parked in one of the bays with its door open.</p>

<p>But when the witness looks back toward the men, one has clambered into his black SUV and has started reversing out of his parking bay as the other attempts to smash the vehicle's windows with a bat. </p>

<p>The unnamed man continues his attack before the driver swings the vehicle round to knock him off his feet. </p>

<p>He quickly jumps back up and stands in front of the vehicle once again alongside a second man who appears to have run into its path in an attempt to stop it. </p>

<p>But the driver accelerates directly toward them both before pushing them up on to the bonnet and sending the man in the grey T-shirt skidding across the road.</p>

<p>Onlookers scream in horror as they rush toward the two men who are now on the floor.</p>

<p>The man who had attempted to stop the car is helped to his feet but the other, who had been wielding the bat, continues to lay motionless as one woman says: 'His head is bleeding really badly.'</p>

<p>The offending car drives off as others hurry to move away from the incident. </p>

<p>It is not known if either man suffered any serious injuries.</p>

<p>The footage was initially recorded on July 4 but has recently been recirculating on social media.</p>
