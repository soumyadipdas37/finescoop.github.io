<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David Moyes has issued a rallying cry to West Ham fans ahead of the new season, pledging to give them a team they can be proud of. </p>

<p>The Hammers boss is seeking much needed consistency and wants players hungry to fight for the shirt. </p>

<p>He told the Times: 'What I'd like is to build. To say to supporters, 'I'm going to give you a team to be proud of. Something that is not going to be flaky. Something with consistency.</p>

<p>David Moyes has signalled his intent and wants consistency from his West Ham side  </p>

<p>'The ends [seating areas] have been brought in closer to the pitch at the stadium and I want fans to come back thinking, 'We've got a team with exciting young talent that every week will give us total commitment.</p>

<p>'The model has to change. I want a club that's looking longer into the future. I don't want players who turn up at West Ham thinking, 'I'm going to put some money in my pocket and have a couple of nice years in London.' </p>

<p>'I want players arriving like Soucek did [from Slavia Prague]: hungry to take the next step.'</p>

<p>Despite the Moyes' declaration of intent, the season is fast approaching and preparation has not been as smooth as it could have been.  </p>

<p>West Ham suffered an embarrassing defeat on Saturday as their pre-season came to an end against relegated Bournemouth at the London Stadium.</p>

<p>West Ham sold Grady Diangana to West Brom for £20million, a decision not well received </p>

<p>The Hammers lost 3-5 to the Cherries, who ran rampant in London as they prepare for life in the Championship this season.</p>

<p>The defeat has added insult to injury after the club's players shared their anger over the sale of £20million winger Grady Diangana to West Brom on Friday night.</p>

<p>In response to Diangana's move to their Premier League rivals, West Ham captain Mark Noble tweeted: 'As captain of this football club I'm gutted, angry and sad that Grady has left, great kid with a great future!!!!!' </p>

<p>Declan Rice 'liked' Noble's tweet in a show of support from the Chelsea target, whilst Jack Wilshere had a sly dig at the club hierachy for the decision.</p>

<p>Mark Noble has tweeted about his anger over West Ham selling Grady Diangana to West Brom</p>

<p>On a post that the 22-year-old posted thanking West Ham for his time with the club, the former Arsenal man did not hold back as he commented: 'Go and do your thing in a club that respects you. Big player with a big future.' </p>

<p>The winger played a huge part in Slaven Bilic's Baggies side last season that earned automatic promotion back to the topflight.</p>

<p>He made 31 appearances for West Brom last season, scoring eight goals and setting up six more.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Diangana opted to rejoin the former Hammers boss at the Hawthorns in another disappointing transfer blow for the London club.</p>

<p>The club provided a statement in which they explained their reasons for selling Diangana, who many of the fans believed to be among their most talented attackers. </p>

<p>West Ham team-mate Declan Rice 'liked' Noble's tweet in a show of support for his captain</p>

<p>The club said: 'Having found himself in competition with the likes of Felipe Anderson, Michail Antonio, Pablo Fornals, Robert Snodgrass and Andriy Yarmolenko for a wide attacking position, with Jarrod Bowen added to that list in January this year. </p>

<p>'The decision to sell Grady has been made reluctantly but - ultimately - in the best interests of the Club and with the aim to strengthen the squad in different areas at this time.</p>

<p>'The money received for Grady will be reinvested entirely in the team, in line with the manager's targets.</p>

<p>'We believe that this will give us the best possible chance of ensuring we have a balanced squad to compete in the Premier League and capable of reaching our objectives and ambitions this season.' </p>

<p>The winger had five years left on his deal at the London Stadium before leaving for the Midlands. </p>
