<p>Surprising admission: Channel Nine sports presenter Tony Jones confesses he is 'insanely shy' after AFL WAG Rebecca Judd rejected his kiss live on air</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Tony's admission was met with sighs from his co-hosts, Peter turned to Jo for input, and she said: 'I'm not surprised by that.'</p>

<p>'Well, I'll tell you what, you cover it very well,' Peter followed up.</p>

<p>'Well, I could not ever walk into a party on my own or anything like that... I am insanely shy,' he reiterated.</p>

<p>Shy: Tony explained co-hosts Peter Hitchener (centre) and Jo Hall (right) that being on stage and hosting an event doesn't worry him. He said: 'It's the fact that I can't just go up and speak to somebody. I can't do that'</p>

<p>Jo backed him up by saying that he believed he could have the same confidence, like when they emcee a function.</p>

<p>Tony explained that being on stage doesn't worry him, explaining: 'It's the fact that I can't just go up and speak to somebody. I can't do that.'</p>

<p>In August 2016, the sports presenter had a very awkward encounter with Rebecca Judd on her final day on Nine News Melbourne before going on maternity leave. </p>

<p>Tony said 'Good luck, Bec!' before leaning in to try and give the AFL WAG a peck on the cheek.</p>

<p>At that moment, the WAG instinctively pulled away and yelped, before bursting into fits of giggles.</p>

<p>Realising he had just been rejected on camera, Tony crossed his arms and grumbled, 'OK, good, this is going well,' as his face turned red.</p>

<p>Awkward! The incident with Rebecca occurred on Nine News Melbourne in August 2016, when Tony attempted to give the AFL WAG a peck on the cheek before she went on maternity leave</p>
