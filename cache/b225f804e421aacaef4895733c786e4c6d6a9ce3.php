<p>The author, 55, appeared to take aim at her critics yesterday, tweeting a photograph of herself wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan: 'This witch doesn't burn'.</p>

<p>She followed up her message with a link to the Wild Womyn Workshop, writing: 'If you are (or know) a witch who wants one of these, don't buy from cynical chancers.'</p>

<p>Furious critics were quick to point out that the website sells a series of other items they deemed 'transphobic', with users sharing images of badges reading 'f*** your pronouns' and 'trans activism is misogyny'.</p>

<p>Wild Womyn Workshop, which has a category dedicated to 'gender critical' items, also sells a badge reading 'dead men don't rape' alongside stickers stating 'trans-ideology erases women.'   </p>

<p>JK Rowling is embroiled in yet another transphobia row after she directed fans to a website selling 'offensive' badges and stickers saying 'transwomen are men'</p>

<p>Social media users accused Rowling of promoting transphobia by sharing the link, with one writing: 'How about considering supporting trans-inclusive organisations instead of incredibly transphobic ones?</p>

<p>'Every time I think you can't be a worse TERF, you somehow do. The bar is literally so low.' </p>

<p>Others branded the Harry Potter author a TERF - a slur meaning a trans exclusionary radical feminist - while urging Rowling to 'understand the damage and hatefulness you have caused a group of people.'</p>

<p>Another critic added: 'Coming out being transphobic proudly now... wow... I hope one day you understand the damage and hatefulness you are continuously causing a group of people when you could have used your influence and money to help people.</p>

<p>'You honestly should be ashamed.'</p>

<p>A third added: 'Words cannot express how disappointed I am in you.' </p>

<p>The author, 55, appeared to take aim at her critics yesterday, tweeting a photograph of herself wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan: 'This witch doesn't burn'</p>

<p>Furious critics were quick to point out that the website sells a series of other items they deemed 'transphobic', with users sharing images of badges reading 'dead men don't rape'</p>

<p>Other products at the store read 'f*** your pronouns' (pictured), causing fury to erupt over the author's tweet</p>

<p>Responding to the criticism, Angela Wild, who runs Wild Womyn Workshop, told MailOnline: 'Men are not women. No-one can change sex.</p>

<p>'These simple statements are now considered "transphobic" and controversial. If some people are offended by my products because they are triggered by biological reality I am sorry for them but it has got nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>'Don't like my products? Don't buy them. It's not unlawful to tell the truth.'</p>

<p>Ms Wild, a self-proclaimed lesbian feminist, is a co-founder of the anti-trans, lesbian separatist group Get the L Out, which staged a demonstration at London Pride in 2018.</p>

<p>The author's latest row comes just a week after furious backlash erupted over her newest novel, in which a male serial killer dresses as a woman to slay his victims.</p>

<p>Troubled Blood - written under Rowling's pseudonym Robert Galbraith - follows detective Cormoran Strike as he uncovers what happened to missing GP Margot Bamborough. </p>

<p>Social media users accused Rowling of promoting transphobia by sharing the link</p>

<p>He fears she fell victim to Dennis Creed, who has been dubbed a 'transvestite serial killer' for murdering his victims while wearing female clothing.</p>

<p>An early review of the 900-page book by The Daily Telegraph - in which the critic states the book's 'moral seems to be: never trust a man in a dress' - sparked immediate backlash online.</p>

<p>Furious readers rushed to Twitter to share their thoughts, making #RIPJKRowling trend in the UK.</p>

<p>Others said the book - which had not been released at the time - is not transphobic at all and over-eager detractors should read it before jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p> The author's latest row comes just a week after furious backlash erupted over her newest novel Troubled Blood</p>

<p>Observer journalist Nick Cohen wrote: 'I've read the latest Strike novel, and the claim it's anti-trans is total sh***. </p>

<p>'I can't tell you why it is total sh*** without giving away the ending. So until you read it yourself, which you should, you will just have to trust me: this is total sh***.'</p>

<p>A Twitter user called Steve replied stating: 'But when you combine it with all the negative stereotyping she's done about trans women, it shows a clear pattern. </p>

<p>'It's not anti-trans as such but it does play into the fears that trans women are cis males looking to spy on women.'</p>

<p>Cohen replied: 'Read the bloody book why don't you?' </p>

<p>In June, the Harry Potter author hit headlines after she mocked an online article using the words 'people who menstruate' instead of 'women'. </p>

<p>She was hit by what she described as 'relentless attacks' after she wrote: 'I'm sure there used to be a word for those people. Someone help me out. Wumben? Wimpund? Woomud?'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Furious readers rushed to Twitter to share their thoughts, making #RIPJKRowling trend in the UK.</p>

<p>The acclaimed novelist then penned a deeply personal essay to address the controversy, revealing she was sexually assaulted in her 20s and saying she still feels the scars of 'domestic violence' in her first marriage. </p>

<p>Rowling's remarks sparked backlash from a range of stars including Ron Weasley actor Rupert Grint, Emma Watson who played Hermione Granger in the film franchise, Daniel Radcliffe who played Harry and Eddie Redmayne, who stars in her Fantastic Beasts films. </p>

<p>But actor Robbie Coltrane - who played Rubeus Hagrid in the movies - told the Radio Times: 'I don't think what she said was offensive really. </p>

<p>'I don't know why but there's a whole Twitter generation of people who hang around waiting to be offended. </p>

<p>He added: 'That's me talking like a grumpy old man, but you just think, "Oh, get over yourself".'</p>
