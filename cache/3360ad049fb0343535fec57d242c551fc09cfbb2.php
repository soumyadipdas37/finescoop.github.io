<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A thrifty shopper has showed off his incredible marked down grocery haul after spending less than $16 on meats and seafood worth $150.</p>

<p>The man, from Melbourne, managed to cut down the cost of his shop at Coles when he purchased a basket full of lamb fillets, chicken breast and marylands and prawns for a fraction of the price.</p>

<p>His grocery bill included two packs of $11 prawns for just $1.10 each, three packs of lamb fillets from $1.37, five packs of two-piece chicken maryland from 61 cents and two packs of diced chicken breast for $1.80.</p>

<p>'Nearly $150 worth for under $16. Been a while since I've scored this good,' he said in Markdown Addicts Australia Facebook group. </p>

<p>A thrifty shopper has showed off his incredible marked down grocery haul after spending less than $16 on meats and seafood worth $150</p>

<p>He said the best-before date ended on the same day he purchased the products.</p>

<p>The shopper said he was very pleased with his bargain buys after spending just '$2 for a kilo of breast fillet, $1 per kilo for maryland and just over $1 for 200g of prawns'.</p>

<p>Many were impressed with his heavily discounted haul, describing it as a 'great bargain' for spotting them at the right time.</p>

<p>'Fantastic! Haven't seen markdowns this good for ages,' one woman said, while another added: 'Good on you. Winner winner, chicken dinner.'</p>

<p>Others pointed out the lamb fillets were the best deal he got.</p>

<p>'That lamb is an awesome score. Well done,' one said.</p>

<p>However, not everyone was on board with the discount, with one man saying: 'I'd be wary of the chicken, unless all cooked today.'</p>

<p>Australian shoppers have revealed exactly when they shop at Coles, Woolworths and ALDI for heavily discounted meat, bread and seafood.</p>

<p>Woolworths customers said most bakery items and selected fresh produce are usually marked down every evening.</p>

<p>'Woolworths, evening for all bakery markdowns,' one said, while another added: 'Woolworths after 4.30pm, they markdown bread, pastries and meat.'</p>

<p>To get your hands on discounted items, some customers suggested visiting the supermarket store early in the morning or in the evening.</p>

<p>'I find Tuesday mornings are best where I live. Seem to get good markdowns at that time,' one shopper said.</p>

<p>Another revealed: 'I go around 6.30pm to 7pm and usually get my shopping done in record time and get some good markdown bargains,' while one said: 'I've found my Woolies is good for markdowns early in the morning. Quite often I go in at around 8.30am and they are marking stuff down.' </p>

<p>To get your hands on the best deals at ALDI, many shoppers suggested avoiding Saturday and Wednesday mornings as they are the busiest days of the week.</p>

<p>'Avoid Aldi on Wednesday mornings especially within the first hour of trade and all day Saturday. Between 11am and 2pm is the busiest period every day so come in earlier,' one said.</p>

<p>And another warned: 'Just don't go to ALDI on a Saturday, it's busy those days.'</p>

<p>The bargain buy comes just days after a chef scored the 'best markdown of all time' after she purchased $46 worth of roast pork for just 20 cents at Coles </p>

<p>The bargain buy comes just days after a chef scored the 'best markdown of all time' after she purchased $46 worth of roast pork for just 20 cents at Coles. </p>

<p>The woman, from Victoria, said she was in the middle of lining up to pay for her grocery when she noticed an employee slashing the prices off the hot food.</p>

<p>So she wandered over to the shelf assuming the two $23 pork roasts were reduced down to $10 each - but she was stunned to find a 10 cent price tag upon closer inspection.</p>

<p>'I was there just before closing and I was waiting in the line to pay for other items as she marked them down,' she wrote in Markdown Addicts Australia Facebook page.</p>

<p>'From far, I thought they were marked down to $10 and I was like sweet, I'll grab one. Then bam, they where 10 cents each so grabbed them both. One of my best scores.'</p>

<p>Thrifty shoppers have been raving on social media about how they've managed to slash hundreds of dollars off their grocery bills just by shopping at the right times</p>

<p>She explained the roasts were heavily discounted because her supermarket has been shutting early every night due to strict stage four COVID-19 lockdown.</p>

<p>'They were reduced to that price because in Melbourne, our supermarkets close at 7.30pm at the moment,' she said. </p>

<p>The woman shared her bargain buy on social media, with many shoppers praising her for snapping up the 'best bargain ever' at the 'right time, right place'.</p>

<p>'Wow! Best I've got on one of those roasts was about $8 and even that is a bargain. Good score,' one woman said, while another added: 'That's nuts. Great score! Cheapest I've paid is $5.'</p>

<p>Supermarkets tend to discount items progressively through the day, with 20, 40, 60, 80 and eventually 99 per cent slashed off the retail prices of popular items.</p>

<p>There are no set time-of-day for markdowns as products go out of date constantly - but some supermarket employees suggest the best times to shop are either around 11am and 4pm.</p>
