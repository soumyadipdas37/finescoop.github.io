<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian father stranded in the UK with his family has raised eyebrows after name-dropping his Channel Nine presenter cousin Sylvia Jeffreys in an attempt to fast-track his return to Australia in time for Christmas.</p>

<p>About 25,000 Australians are stranded overseas after the government capped the number of international airport arrivals in July to ease the pressure on hotel quarantine programs introduced since the COVID-19.</p>

<p>Teacher Edward Swanwick - who has worked at the elite Clifton College private school in Bristol in the UK's south-west - said his situation was 'desperate' and claimed his famous cousin had urged him to contact A Current Affair to 'help keep the pressure on the Federal Government'. </p>

<p>A deputy head teacher at an elite British private school has name-dropped his TV presenter star cousin Sylvia Jeffreys and shared a photo of them together in a bid to get back home faster as the COVID-19 pandemic slows down international travel </p>

<p>Deputy head teacher Edward Swanwick said his situation was 'desperate' and claimed Jeffreys had urged him to contact A Current Affair with other families trying in vain to get home</p>

<p>'We’re a family of five Australians wanting to return home from the UK,' he wrote in a hotel quarantine Facebook group.</p>

<p>'My cousin is Sylvia Jeffreys, from Channel Nine, who has suggested I find a few individuals or families who are in a really desperate situation, so she can pitch a story to A Current Affair.</p>

<p>'While our situation feels desperate, I’m sure we are not in as desperate a situation as others.' </p>

<p>Mr Swanwick - whose LinkedIn page also lists one of his previous positions as a senior boarding housemaster at The Scots College in Sydney's eastern suburbs - admitted ACA was not his 'program of choice'.</p>

<p>'But it’s the one that Sylvia thinks will be most interested and it has a really good viewer base,' he said as he called on other members of the group to share their travel woes with him to the current affairs show.</p>

<p>Britain is struggling with a second wave of coronavirus cases with more than 6,000 cases of the deadly respiratory illness recorded nationally on Wednesday.</p>

<p>On September 14, the country's government banned more than six people from meeting together to stem the virus' spread - through a rule dubbed the 'Rule of Six'.</p>

<p>Mr Swanwick also shared a personal picture of himself with Jeffreys at her wedding to fellow journalist Peter Stefanovic as way of proving his family connection. </p>

<p>However, other members of the group were quick to doubt whether he was actually the man in the photo.</p>

<p>Other members of the group questioned whether Mr Swanwick was actually the man in the photo - with one even asking for '100 points of ID' to prove the relationship with the Today Extra host</p>

<p>Mr Swanwick shared a picture of him holding up Wednesday's copy of The Times newspaper to prove his identity</p>

<p>'Sylvia might be legit but how do we know that is you?' one person asked.</p>

<p>Another joked he needed to show '100 points of ID' to prove he is in fact her cousin.</p>

<p>In an astonishing response, Mr Swanwick then shared a selfie holding up Wednesday's copy of The Times newspaper with a mask hanging off his ear to show he was in fact the person Jeffreys had her arm around in the wedding photo. </p>

<p>In another Facebook post on Thursday morning, Mr Swanwick claimed he was speaking to Jeffreys about alternative ways of getting his story out to the world.</p>

<p>'She says if ACA don't pick it up, she'll try Nine News and if that fails she will at least write an article for 9news.com.au,' he wrote. </p>

<p>In response, one user said: 'Good on you for trying and pulling strings - hope it helps.'</p>

<p>Jeffreys is the co-host of Today Extra with David Campbell and recently welcomed her first child, Oscar, with husband and Sky News presenter Peter Stefanovic.</p>

<p>In a separate post, the teacher claimed he was speaking to Jeffreys about alternative ways of getting his story out to the world</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Swanwick, Jeffreys and Channel Nine for comment. </p>

<p>Last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed arrival caps preventing Australians from coming home will be increased in stages. </p>

<p>From 28 September New South Wales will take an extra 500 people per week and Queensland and Western Australia will take an extra 200 per week.</p>

<p>On 4 October Queensland will take an extra 300 per week and on October 12 WA will accept an extra 300.</p>

<p>The Board of Airline Representatives of Australia have estimated 87 per cent of 30,000 seats on flights into the country were empty in the first week of September. </p>

<p>About 25,000 Australians are struggling to get home amid widespread limits on arrivals into the country. Here a child plays in the completely empty economy section</p>

<p>Mr Swanwick has previously worked at The Scots College - an elite private school in Sydney's eastern suburbs </p>
