<p>The five adults had travelled from across the city for a picnic in Whittlesea when they were confronted by police on Wednesday.</p>

<p>They admitted they had travelled further than their respective 5km radius, which is against the city's current stage four lockdown rules.</p>

<p>Each adult was issued a $1,652. </p>

<p>They were among the 114 Victorians to be fined in the past 24 hours for breaching the Chief Health Officer directions including 37 for breaching the curfew.</p>

<p>There were 15 fines dished out to revellers who attended a party at a home in Mildura.</p>

<p>The state continues to see a drop in coronavirus cases with just 12 infections and two deaths announced on Thursday. </p>

<p>The new cases bring the state's death toll to 773 and the national fatalities figure to 861, as infection numbers continue to fall. </p>

<p>Metropolitan Melbourne's crucial 14-day rolling average has dropped from 29.4 on Wednesday to just 26.7.  </p>

<p>The case range must be between 30 to 50 for the state to move into the next phase of recovery on September 28.</p>

<p>The regional Victorian average remains steady at 1.1. </p>

<p>There are currently 67 Victorians in hospital with eight people in intensive car and six of those on a ventilator. There are 532 active cases across the state.</p>

<p>Cases with an unknown source in Melbourne between September 8-21 were down to 37 and there were none in regional areas.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews has hinted Melbourne's coronavirus restrictions could be lifted faster than planned as the state steadily manages down its second wave. </p>

<p>With Melbourne's crucial 14-day new case average now well below the 30 level, it appears likely the city will soon move to the next phase of the state government roadmap.</p>

<p>In Thursdays press conference the premier admitted that further announcements will be made on Sunday, but it won't be a 'day of massive steps.</p>

<p>'The roadmap does not speak to that, it is not a day when we essentially throw the doors open,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has hinted Melbourne's coronavirus restrictions could be lifted quicker than first planned as the state slowly gets on top of its second wave</p>

<p>'It will be, however, steady and safe steps, and that sense of gradual, continual progress is what we are able to do because we have a gradual and continued decline in these numbers.'</p>

<p>'At 12 cases or at an average just under 30, that is still too much for us to take steps. We have got to be safe, steady and cautious, otherwise those new settings simply will not last.' </p>

<p>Under the government roadmap announced earlier this month, the changes could include allowing public gatherings for five people from two households.</p>

<p>Schools, child care and some workplaces would open, along with outdoor pools, while personal trainers could operate with two clients.</p>

<p>There could be outdoor religious services for up to five people, plus a leader.</p>
