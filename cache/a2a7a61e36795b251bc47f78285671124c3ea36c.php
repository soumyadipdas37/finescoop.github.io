<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A couple married for 46 years have been through a lot of ups and downs together — including, most recently, COVID-19 and cancer.  </p>

<p>Robert and Janice Beecham almost didn't get to celebrate their anniversary together this year after Robert began experiencing coronavirus symptoms in February and was soon hospitalized.</p>

<p>The illness was a particular blow, given that Janice had health issues herself, and was about to undergo chemotherapy following surgery for breast cancer.</p>

<p>Big deal! Robert and Janice Beecham just celebrated their 46th wedding anniversary</p>

<p>When Robert was hospitalized for COVID-19, Janice couldn't see him. She said: 'I've always been there for him through everything. I didn't want him alone'</p>

<p>Robert's symptoms started in late February, he told Good Morning America. His lungs were congested, he had chills, and he lost his sense of taste.  </p>

<p>At the hospital, he tested postitive for COVID-19.</p>

<p>'The night [before I was diagnosed], I prayed because I was so sick. I told God I was ready to come home,' Robert, who has previously suffered a stroke, said.</p>

<p>Janice, meanwhile, could have used some comfort. After her breast cancer diagnosis, she'd just had surgery and was awaiting her first chemotherapy treatment when her husband got sick.  </p>

<p>'I started crying hysterically because I was like, "I got to get to this man,"' she said. 'I was trying to explain to [the hospital staff], "I've always been there for him through everything." I didn't want him alone.'</p>

<p>Better: Robert recovered, and was soon home with Janice, who is undergoing treatment for breast cancer</p>

<p>Though Janice couldn't visit because of the pandemic, Robert had good doctors taking care of him, including Dr. Satyam Nayak.</p>

<p>Robert confided in Dr. Nayak how important it was that he be home with his wife for their anniversary on April 15. </p>

<p>'You could close your eyes, and the way they talk about each other, you could feel the love,' Dr. Nayak said.</p>

<p>So as Robert got better, Dr. Nayak came up with a plan to get Robert home, quarantining him in the spare bedroom and bathroom for 14 days.  </p>

<p>He'd still be able to see and talk to his wife through a window, and Janice could sit on the patio outside. </p>

<p>'I was so glad to see him. My heart was happy,' Janice said when Robert got home after a week in the hospital. 'When you're together all the time, it's hard when someone is not there.'</p>

<p>Robert even called to thank Dr. Nayak on his anniversary — which the doctor said left him in tears.</p>
