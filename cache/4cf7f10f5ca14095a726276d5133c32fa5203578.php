<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Bale could stay at Tottenham longer than his one-season loan if things go well under Jose Mourinho this season, his agent has confirmed.</p>

<p>The Real Madrid outcast arrived in north London at the end of last week to complete his temporary move back to Spurs, but it could turn into something more permanent.</p>

<p>Bale does not appear to have a future at Real Madrid - at least not under current boss Zinedine Zidane - and his agent Jonathan Barnett has refused to rule out him staying at Spurs longer than the initial agreement.  </p>

<p>Gareth Bale is back at Tottenham and he could stay longer than his season-long loan</p>

<p> Bale's agent Jonathan Barnett admits that Tottenham is where the player wants to be</p>

<p>'I'm sure that if things really worked out well, we'd have no problem,' Barnett said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'This is the club he wants to play at. I don't see any problems if he wants another year.</p>

<p>'Hopefully the subject [of returning to Real] won't come up. He will be so successful at Tottenham he'll want to stay and it will be a simple deal to do the rest.'</p>

<p>Bale has endured a difficult last couple of seasons at the Bernabeu, trying but failing to move on to the Chinese Super League last summer, with Real pulling the plug on the deal at the last minute.</p>

<p>In an honest interview during the most recent international break, Bale put the ball firmly in the club's court and insisted that he was ready to leave whenever the club allowed it.</p>

<p>Finally a move has now come to fruition and Bale has already hailed the 'warm welcome in an environment where I am loved'.</p>

<p>Bale's lack of love at Real Madrid comes despite him winning 13 major trophies with the club and being a vital part of the team that ended a 12-year barren spell in the Champions League.</p>

<p>Bale was hugely successful at Real Madrid but had fallen out of favour in recent years</p>

<p>Rather than just winning the one European Cup though, he went on to win four, as well as two LaLiga titles.</p>

<p>He is also the top-scoring British player in LaLiga history having netted 80 goals in 171 appearances for the Bernabeu giants. </p>

<p>'What I hope is he'll get his love back for the game and play the way he can, but it's up to him,' Barnett added.</p>

<p>'And he's not on trial anywhere. He's achieved more than any other, I think, British footballer abroad, so I think he's fine.'</p>

<p>Bale spent six years at Tottenham in the early stages of his career and is now back at the club</p>
