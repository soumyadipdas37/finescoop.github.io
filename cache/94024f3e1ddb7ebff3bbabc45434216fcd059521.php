<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An EasyJet pilot has been accused of 'ambushing' a passenger with chronic asthma after he demanded the man wear a mask or be thrown off his flight.</p>

<p>Nick, who spoke under partial anonymity, was confronted by the plane's pilot and told he would have to don a face covering despite his explanation he would not be able to breathe during the hour-long flight from Jersey to Gatwick. </p>

<p>He told the BBC he was heckled by the other passengers on the flight and was left with no other choice than to wear a mask - which made him hyperventilate.   </p>

<p>'Whether it's a polo neck or a scarf round your face, the sensation is stifling. I just find it increasingly difficult to breathe,' he said.</p>

<p>Nick, who spoke under partial anonymity, was confronted by the plane's pilot and told he would have to don a face covering despite his explanation he would not be able to breathe during the hour-long flight from Jersey to Gatwick</p>

<p>Although face masks are required in enclosed public spaces such as public transport in England, some people do not have to wear them.</p>

<p>These people include:</p>

<p>Nick's flight was delayed by 30 minutes, something he said the other passengers blamed him for. </p>

<p>In a 30-second video other passengers cheered and applauded the pilot after he told Nick he would be kicked off the flight. </p>

<p>Face coverings are mandatory on public transport in England because they are believed to reduce the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Those who don't have to wear a mask include: children under the age of 11; people who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability and where putting on, wearing or removing a face covering will cause you severe distress. </p>

<p>In England people can choose to carry a card or badge to show they are exempt, according to the Department for Transport in England, but this is a personal choice and not enforced by law.</p>

<p>Nick showed the plane's crew an official exemption card he had printed out from the Government's website before flying to the island of Jersey to see his family last month.</p>

<p>It was accepted on the way to the island but disputed on the return journey - with Nick facing confrontation with staff 'around six times'.</p>

<p>He added: 'I was insulted, shouted at, laughed at. It felt like everybody was against me.'</p>

<p>Footage filmed on Nick's phone showed the pilot telling Nick if he didn't put on a mask he 'was off'. </p>

<p>EasyJet said all customers are required to wear a face covering but acknowledged some passengers can't.</p>

<p>A statement from the airline said: 'We have recently updated our policies in line with recent UK government guidance so that as well as a medical certificate, customers can alternatively provide a relevant document from a government website or lanyard.</p>

<p>In a 30-second video other passengers cheered and applauded the pilot after he told Nick he would be kicked off the flight</p>

<p>Face coverings are mandatory on public transport in England because they are believed to reduce the spread of coronavirus. Pictured, a woman wore a face covering in Caerphilly, Wales, today</p>

<p>'We are sorry that this new policy was not recognised by the crew on this occasion.' </p>

<p>Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation's head of policy, Sarah MacFadyen, said for a small number of people with asthma it is 'impossible for them to breathe' while wearing a mask.</p>

<p>She added: 'That's why these exemptions are in place, so they can still go out and live their lives.' </p>
