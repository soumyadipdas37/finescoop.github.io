<p>Milestone moment: Footy WAG Rebecca Judd has revealed that her nine-year-old son, Oscar, is going on school camp later this week, despite the stage-four lockdown in Melbourne </p>

<p>'My son Oscar has his year three camp coming up,' Rebecca began.</p>

<p>She explained that her eldest child will stay at home for the duration of the 'trip', and has been given a number of tasks and activities to keep him occupied.</p>

<p>'We got a big list of all the things sent home to prepare,' the mother of four said. </p>

<p>The parents at Oscar's school were told to make space and provide play equipment for their children to build forts and cubby houses.</p>

<p>School administrators also sent a tongue-in-cheek letter asking for 'permission to tear the house apart'.</p>

<p>Rebecca added: 'Bush art is needed to be collected. We have a list of gum nut sticks, twigs, rocks... </p>

<p>'There's a Minute to Win It game, so we need plates, biscuits - chocolate-coated will give the best result.' </p>
