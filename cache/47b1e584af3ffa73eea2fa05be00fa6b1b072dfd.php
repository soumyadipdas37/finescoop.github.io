<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Elon Musk has overtaken Mark Zuckerberg to become the world's third richest person with an estimated personal fortune of $115.4billion.</p>

<p>The 49-year-old PayPal founder has seen his wealth rise by $87.8 billion this year off the back of a surge in Tesla stocks, which have increased in value by 500%.</p>

<p>There are now just two people in the world who have amassed more wealth than Musk - Microsoft founder Bill Gates, with an estimated wealth of $125billion and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, with a fortune of $200billion.</p>

<p>Elon Musk has risen to become the world's third-richest man with an estimated fortune of $115.4billion, after overtaking Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg</p>

<p>Musk's rise comes off the back of a surge in the value of Tesla stock, which has risen by 500% this year due to the company turning a consistent profit (the drop in value is due to a stock split, which lowers the value of individual shares but leaves the company value untouched)</p>

<p>Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook, is estimated to be worth $111billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p>

<p>Tesla shares have been on a meteoric rise since October last year, and were only briefly dampened by the coroanvirus shutdown which hit in March.</p>

<p>It comes after the company began turning a consistent profit, meaning it could soon be added to the blue-chip S&amp;P 500 index, further boosting its value.</p>

<p>The share value hit an all-time high of $935 per share on June 12 and had more-than doubled again by the end of last month, hitting $2,213 on August 28.</p>

<p>Shares are now sitting around $500 each after the company completed a forward split - where a company multiplies the amount of shares each person holds.</p>

<p>The move doesn't devalue the company overall, but it does reduce the value of each individual share, with the aim being to encourage more people to invest.</p>

<p>Tesla used a 5:1 split, meaning each shareholder now owns five times the number of shares they did before, while new investors will pay a fifth the price for new shares.</p>

<p>The company saw its overall value rise 10 per cent following the split, as new investors rushed to snap up the cheaper stocks.</p>

<p>Tesla also announced on Tuesday that it is planning a fresh round of fundraising, aiming to raise $5billion through stock sales.</p>

<p>The news sent the company's stock up by another 3 per cent. Tesla is now worth an estimated $440billion.</p>

<p>Zuckerberg is worth an estimated $111billion, $4bn behind Musk. The world's richest man remains Amazon founder Jeff Bezos (right) with a fortune of $200billion</p>

<p>Apple also completed its own stock split at the weekend, going 4:1 and bringing the value of each individual share down from around $500 per share to $130 per share.</p>

<p>The splits both helped generate activity that propelled the market to one of its best August performances since the 1980s.</p>

<p>The S&amp;P 500 has risen 7 per cent this month, putting it on track for its biggest August jump since 1986.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 7.6 per cent in August, its best performance since 1984. </p>

<p>Last week, Musk unveiled Neuralink technology which he has invested $80million in, in the hopes of making humans able to control computers with their brains.</p>

<p>The three little pig's demo, as he called it, showed an animal named Gertrude with the brain implant. While she snuffed around in a pen, viewers saw her brain activity on a large screen.</p>

<p>The livestream also gave the first look of the redesigned chip, which is the size of a large coin attached to wires that replace a piece of skull when connected to the brain.</p>

<p>'It's like a Fitbit in your skull', Musk said during the event.</p>

<p>'It goes flush on your skull. I could have a Link right now and you wouldn't know. Maybe I do.'</p>

<p>Although the public may have hoped to see a person use the powers of the chip, the event suggests Neuralink is getting closer to Musk's vision of allowing humans to control computers and smartphones with their mind.</p>
