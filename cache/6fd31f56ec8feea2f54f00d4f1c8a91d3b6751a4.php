<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian tennis star Mark Philippoussis has revealed the extent of his wild hedonistic life off court and the moment that changed his drive to play the game.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old opened up about his luxurious spending habits and extravagant lifestyle through his career that saw him driving flash cars and dating celebrities as he climbed the tennis ranks.</p>

<p>The two-time Grand Slam runner up told 'The Howie Games' the story of how he bought a $100,000 car only to sell it the next day after driving home from the dealership.</p>

<p>'I'm not exaggerating when I say I would easily go through one car a month and just change it,' Philippoussis said.</p>

<p>'I never kept it because it never made me happy, I was just bored.'</p>

<p>Mark Phillippoussis (pictured with wife Silvana and son Nicholas) has opened up about his extravagant and luxurious life off the tennis court</p>

<p>Philippoussis lived in Florida in the 1990s and took a drive to Tampa with a friend to check out the Dodge and Chevrolet dealers.</p>

<p>The pair took to the road in a Hummer convertible and slid out on the slippery road on the way there, slamming into a concrete barrier and totaling the car.</p>

<p>The Scud refused to head home despite the crash and took a taxi to the dealers, which were across the road from each other, and told them whoever had their Viper or Corvette ready first would take his money.</p>

<p>'You can laugh, because it's ridiculous,' Philippoussis said. </p>

<p>'Long story short, the Dodge Viper was ready in 45 minutes. They detailed it and I bought the car on my American Express and I drove back home with the car but I didn't fit in it properly, so the next day I sold it.'</p>

<p>Philippoussis called it a 'messed up story' and a 'stupid thing', all because he refused to drive home in a taxi.</p>

<p>Philippoussis was known for his party boy antics and dated a slew of celebrities including singer Delta Goodrem (pictured together)</p>

<p>The Poo enjoyed career highlights as Australian Davis Cup captain, taking the win in 1999 and 2003 and celebrated like a party animal after his achievements.</p>

<p>He said he wanted to have a life off the tennis court and be able to enjoy himself on the outside of his professional life.</p>

<p>'When I was on the court, I played. When I trained, I trained hard. But as soon as that thing was over, I switched off and enjoyed my life,' Philippoussis said.</p>

<p>'The greats have almost no life, and that's the reality of it. They're obsessed, you need to be obsessed with everything about what you're doing. </p>

<p>'That's what needs to happen and that wasn't me. It was at the start, but that wasn't me, and I can just be honest and say that.'</p>

<p>Philippoussis hits a backhand in the 1998 US Open. He made the final that year, finishing runner up to fellow Australian Pat Rafter</p>

<p>This push to appreciate and celebrate his life with family and friends stemmed from a cancer scare to Philippoussis' dad Nick in his teenage years.</p>

<p>The thought of losing his dad put life in perspective for Philippoussis, leading him to change his priorities and realise what was truly important.</p>

<p>'Watching someone that you love, you think they have a certain amount of time left to live, changed everything for me. And tennis seemed not so important anymore,' he said.</p>

<p>'It got to a stage where I realised I didn't care about eating, sleeping, breathing tennis because my first priority in my life was always my family.</p>

<p>'I grew up that way but that took it to another level seeing someone, your father, who helped me become who I am, almost losing him to cancer. It changed everything.</p>

<p>'I didn't give a crap about tennis anymore to be honest with you.'</p>

<p>Phillippoussis said his outlook on tennis changed in his teenage years after his father Nick (pictured together) was diagnosed with cancer</p>
