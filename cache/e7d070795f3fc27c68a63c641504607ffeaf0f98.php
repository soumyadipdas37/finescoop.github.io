<p>Since August 2, Melbourne residents have been banned from hiring someone to mow their lawn or clean their house as part of the state's strict, Stage Four coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>Jim Penman, the founder of the Jim's Group company with 3,800 franchisees, has slammed Premier Daniel Andrews' for shutting the economy, and then on Sunday announcing a $3billion Business Survival and Adaptation Package with handouts of up to $20,000 for affected businesses with a wages bill of up to $10million. </p>

<p>The founder of Jim's Mowing has blasted the Victorian government for banning his franchisees from working and then offering traders a $3billion small business package</p>

<p>'This is a sick joke. He throws us out of work, destroys our business for absolutely no reason, no reason at all,' he told Sky News presenter Paul Murray on Sunday night.</p>

<p>'He tosses us a few dollars and we're expected to say, "Thank you, wonderful Premier,".</p>

<p>'This is absolute garbage, this is absolutely obscene. I can’t tell you how furious I am at what’s going on.'</p>

<p>Mr Penman, an outspoken critic of Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions, has also called out the double standard of pet groomers and council grass cutters being allowed to work - as his lawn mowing franchisees were banned.</p>

<p>'I am shocked and appalled. I cannot comprehend what is happening. He doesn’t even pretend to have any reason.</p>

<p>'I've asked him directly: "What are your reasons for saying that? Why can council operators operate and ours can't?"</p>

<p>'This is not health. This is nasty, grubby, power-grabbing politics by a man who cares nothing for the health of this community.'</p>

<p>On Saturday, Mr Andrews announced that pet groomers would be allowed to resume operating from September 28. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, lawn mower operator who travel more than 5km from home will liable for a $1,652 on-the-spot fine, which a magistrate can increase to $10,000 for repeat offences.</p>

<p>Mr Penman on August 5 called on his franchisees to ignore the state's Stage Four restrictions and offered to pay their fines, three days after the new level of lockdowns came into effect. </p>

<p>He is preparing a lawsuit about the Victorian government estimating the stricter lockdowns have cost 615 contractors $3,000 a week in lost earnings. </p>

<p>While the state government has announced a $3billion small business package, the Institute of Public Affairs think tank estimates the Stage Four restrictions have cost the Victorian economy $3.17billion a week.</p>
