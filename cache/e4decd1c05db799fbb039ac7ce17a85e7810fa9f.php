<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thailand's king and queen have attended celebrations at a hospital as crop-top-wearing protesters mocked his clothing and called for his power to be reduced.</p>

<p>King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida were at the Siriraj hospital in Bangkok for Prince Mahidol Day - to commemorate his contribution to medical education.</p>

<p>The monarch, who has spent the pandemic in Germany with an army of 'sex soldiers', laid a wreath at the foot of his grandfather's statue, local media said.</p>

<p>It is not clear if his mistress Sineenatra Wongvajirabhakdi, who was reinstated as his royal consort after being released from jail earlier this month, was at the event.</p>

<p>She has been given back her royal and military titles after she was previously accused of seeking to undermine the monarch's official wife, the queen.</p>

<p>It comes as a thousand demonstrators rallied at parliament as it debated amending the constitution, one of the demands behind nearly two months daily protests.</p>

<p>Protesters wore crop tops and sprayed a democracy plaque outside the building as they mocked the king for his clothing.</p>

<p>The two-day session of parliament was convened on Wednesday and was expected to vote late tonight on whether to accept a motion for constitutional changes.</p>

<p>But a lawmaker aligned with the government proposed the vote be postponed to November and a new committee be set up to study details around the process first.</p>

<p>The proposal was met with resistance from opposition parties and also angered the protesters.</p>

<p>Anon Nampa, one of the protest leaders, said: 'Do you hear the people? Or is the building so thick?'</p>

<p>The protesters want to change a constitution they say was engineered to ensure ex-junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stayed on as prime minister after last year's election.</p>

<p>Last July, Vajiralongkorn gave Sineenatra the royal consort title of chao khun phra sineenatra bilasakalayani, reviving an old palace tradition of taking a junior wife that had not been practiced for almost a century.</p>

<p>It came after he Vajiralongkorn named Suthida Vajiralongkorn Na Ayudhya his queen in May 2019 when they were married a few days before his formal coronation. </p>

<p>Vajiralongkorn assumed the throne after the 2016 death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for 70 years.</p>

<p>Then last October, less than three months after making Sineenatra his royal consort, the king issued a command rescinding the appointment.</p>

<p>In a statement, he accused her of misbehaving by actively seeking to block Suthida's appointment as queen in order to take the position herself.</p>

<p>He said when she failed to block Suthida, her 'ambitions and aspirations' led her to continue to seek ways to promote herself.</p>

<p>That statement said the king tried to alleviate the problem by appointing Sineenatra his official royal consort but she remained unsatisfied and continued to compete.</p>

<p>Both Queen Suthida and Sineenatra have served as senior officers in palace security units.</p>

<p>Sineenat had trained as a pilot in Thailand and abroad, served in the King's royal bodyguard unit, and in 2019 was awarded the rank of a major-general</p>

<p>Suthida was previously a flight attendant with Thai Airways, while Sineenatra was an army nurse.</p>

<p>The king has seven children by three previous marriages, all of which ended in divorce.</p>

<p>It emerged earlier this month the king, who has spent much of the pandemic in Germany with a reputed entourage of 'sex soldiers' assembled as a military unit at a four-star hotel, had pardoned Sineenat and went to Munich Airport himself to pick her up.</p>

<p>The consort, also known as Koi Wongvajirapakdi, was gifted the title of royal consort to mark the king's 67th birthday last July. </p>

<p>It was the first time in nearly a century that a Thai monarch had taken a consort, after the king married his fourth wife Queen Suthida earlier in 2019.</p>

<p>Sineenat had trained as a pilot in Thailand and abroad, served in the king's royal bodyguard unit, and in 2019 was awarded the rank of a major-general. </p>

<p>During the king's elaborate three-day coronation ceremony, Sineenat was seen marching in full military uniform in a procession that travelled from the palace to several Buddhist temples.</p>

<p>However, Sineenat was out within three months and stripped of all her titles for 'disloyalty' and alleged 'ambition' to match the Queen's position.</p>

<p>Her actions showed 'she does not give any honour to the king and does not understand royal tradition... her actions are to benefit herself', a statement claimed.     </p>

<p>Koi has apparently been in prison since then, although her exact whereabouts were unclear. </p>

<p>According to Bild, she was in the Bang Kwang maximum-security prison where inmates including drug dealers are constantly monitored with webcams. </p>

<p>The prison is said to include around 1,000 people on death row, and was the venue where Thailand carried out its first execution for nearly a decade in 2018.   </p>

<p>Thailand expert Andrew MacGregor Marshall said she had been in a women's prison at a different compound in Bangkok. </p>

<p>However, he cited palace sources saying Sineenat had been released and was due to fly to Germany imminently. </p>

<p>The report by Bild said she was taken straight to the airport and flown to Munich on a private plane, with a refuelling stop in Dubai.</p>

<p>The king himself is said to have picked her up wearing his customary tank top at Munich Airport. </p>

<p>The king and his entourage then drove straight to the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in the German resort town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, it is claimed. </p>

<p>Reports earlier this year said the king had booked out the whole fourth floor which includes a 'pleasure room' and is decked out with 'treasures and antiques' from Thailand.</p>

<p>His 'sex soldiers' are said to be assembled as a military unit called the SAS like Britain's special forces - with the same motto, 'who dares wins'. </p>

<p>One hotel worker said staff are forbidden from the fourth floor where the king and his entourage have set up camp.  </p>

<p>However, the king's diplomatic immunity means that there is little German authorities can do about it.  </p>

<p>Queen Suthida reportedly spends most of her time at Hotel Waldegg in Engelberg, Switzerland, without her husband. </p>

<p>The king is protected from criticism in Thailand by one of the world's toughest defamation laws, with prison sentences up to 15 years.</p>
