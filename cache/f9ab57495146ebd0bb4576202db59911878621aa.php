<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pregnant woman arrested by police in her pyjamas in front of her children over an anti-lockdown Facebook post revealed she feared she was being 'kidnapped' during the ordeal. </p>

<p>Several officers entered Zoe Buhler's home in Miners Rest, Ballarat, northwest of Melbourne, with a search warrant and began reading the young mother her rights. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old was handcuffed in the lounge room in front of her children and partner on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>She was charged with incitement after writing a Facebook post allegedly inciting a protest against Daniel Andrew's draconian lockdown in Victoria.</p>

<p>'I just wanted to feel like I was doing something to stand up for human rights,' Ms Buhler said on the Today show on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>'I was scared I was being kidnapped by people because obviously they weren't in uniforms.</p>

<p>'I've been charged with incitement and I'm still yet to know exactly what that means.' </p>

<p>Ms Buhler's allegedly created a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event planned for 11am on Saturday on Sturt Street.</p>

<p>'PEACEFUL PROTEST! All social distancing measures are to be followed so we don't get arrested,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'Anyone from Ballarat please join us in our fight for freedom and human rights! END LOCKDOWN. STAND FOR HUMAN RIGHTS. WE LIVE IN A "FREE" COUNTRY.'</p>

<p>Ms Buhler's partner filmed the dramatic police arrest, which has since been widely as 'absolutely disgusting' and 'not okay'. </p>

<p>Zoe Buhler, 28, was handcuffed in her lounge room in front of her children on Wednesday afternoon and charged with incitement</p>

<p>Ms Buhler allegedly created this event for Saturday at 11am on Sturt Street in Ballarat</p>

<p>Former Queensland Premier Campbell Newman labelled Victoria Police the 'shame of the nation'.</p>

<p>'The Vic Police. Shame of the nation. Unwilling to deal with youth gangs,' he tweeted.</p>

<p>;Compromised totally over Lawyer X. Waved through BLM protests. Found a job they can do, enforce a tyrant's draconian laws against normal Australians who simply want to earn a living and get on with life.' </p>

<p>Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie said arresting Ms Buhler in front of her children was 'absolute overkill' by the police. </p>

<p>'To come in like that and put a woman that's pregnant in handcuffs that was [acting] peaceful, there was no need,' she told The Today Show. </p>

<p>'They could have just knocked on the door and said "can you please come down to the police station to take a statement".'</p>

<p>'It could have been done a whole lot more peacefully.'   </p>

<p>Mother-of-two Ms Buhler with her boyfriend James Timmins, who filmed her being arrested</p>

<p>Sunrise contributor and columnist Rita Panahi also shared her disgust at the officers' 'unnecessary' actions. </p>

<p>'FFS they’ve put in her handcuffs after she told them she’s pregnant. Victoria Police also causing unnecessary distress to her small children...all over a bloody Facebook post about a proposed protest. A post she offered to remove,' she tweeted.</p>

<p>Host Karl Stefanovic said that while Ms Buhler shouldn't have been handcuffed in front of her children, Victoria Police were right to arrest her.</p>

<p>'Everyone's been doing the right thing, and this lady - irrespective of if she's pregnant or not - has broken the law,' he said. </p>

<p>'I don't think there should be any tolerance to it.' </p>

<p>The video, which has since made international headlines in US and UK media, shows the confused mother asking why she is being arrested.  </p>

<p>Police are seen patrolling Melbourne on Wednesday (pictured) as the strict lockdown continued</p>

<p>Zoe Buhler, 28,(pictured) said she feared she was being kidnapped during the arrest on Wednesday</p>

<p>'Excuse me, incitement for what, what on Earth? I'm in my pyjamas, my two kids are here,' she asked police.</p>

<p>'I have an ultrasound in an hour because I'm pregnant.'  </p>

<p>The increasingly distressed mother insisted she wasn't breaking any laws by creating and then promoting the event. </p>

<p>'Actually you are, that's why we're arresting you in relation to incitement,' police replied.</p>

<p>Ms Buhler offered to delete the post as her boyfriend James Timmins tried to mediate while cradling their infant child in his arms.</p>

<p>'How about she just doesn't do the event? It's not like she's done it, she made a post,' he said.</p>

<p>Police were unmoved, telling her: 'You've already committed the offence.' </p>

<p>Ms Buhler was distressed by this point and crying so much she could barely tell officers that she 'didn't realise' she was 'doing anything wrong' in making the online event.  </p>

<p>Police said they would seize all electronic devices in the house including those belonging to Mr Timmins and Ms Buhler's sister.</p>

<p>Ms Buhler was charged with later incitement released on bail to face Ballarat Magistrates Court on January 25 next year. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia anybody thinking of 'attending the protest... can expect a swift and firm response from police.'</p>

<p>'We will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.' </p>

<p>Regional Victorian towns like Ballarat are spared the ultra-tough Stage Four lockdown but are still in Stage Three, making it illegal for more than two people to gather.</p>

<p>Ms Buhler's alleged offending post linked to a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event she created</p>

<p>Ms Buhler offered to delete the post but was told she had already committed an offence</p>

<p>Police consider any protests to be in breach of these rules and have proved willing to arrest anyone organising or encouraging any gatherings.</p>

<p>Victoria Police claimed the protest would put lives at risk and anyone who showed up would be fined or arrested. </p>

<p>Radio king-turned Sky News pundit Alan Jones was so enraged by seeing the video of Ms Buhler's arrest that he called on Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to resign.</p>

<p>'Thankfully I am not the only Australian who thinks this is appalling, disgusting and disgraceful,' he wrote in a rant to his Facebook page after Daily Mail Australia published the video.</p>

<p>'The only person guilty of incitement is the Premier of Victoria.</p>

<p>'His outlandish grab for power, his disdain of any accountability is forcing people to behaviour simply designed to take back their freedom.'  </p>

<p>Radio king-turned Sky News pundit Alan Jones was so enraged by seeing the video of Ms Buhler's arrest that he called on Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to resign.</p>

<p>He posted this comment to his Facebook page after seeing the video after Daily Mail Australia was the first to publish it. </p>

<p>DANIEL ANDREWS SHOULD RESIGN TONIGHT</p>

<p>Thankfully I am not the only Australian who thinks this is appalling, disgusting and disgraceful.</p>

<p>A pregnant woman, forced into tears, handcuffed in her pyjamas, in front of her children, I think it is in Ballarat, for 'incitement'.</p>

<p>The only person guilty of incitement is the Premier of Victoria.</p>

<p>His outlandish grab for power, his disdain of any accountability is forcing people to behaviour simply designed to take back their freedom.</p>

<p>This woman is a victim of the appalling and unlimited powers given to the Victorian police.</p>

<p>Everyone knew it would come to this. You can only push people so far.</p>

<p>Wherein lies the violence in what you see here? The violence towards a pregnant mother is the like of which no Australian will tolerate.</p>

<p>Go Daniel Andrews and go now before more damage is done.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews is facing mounting pressure to resign from his post amid the strict lockdown, particularly after he successfully extended the state of emergency by another six months.</p>

<p>The bill passed just before 2am on Wednesday in the Victorian Upper House, with 20 votes in favour and 19 against. </p>

<p>The six-month extension was a compromise by Mr Andrews, who initially proposed a 12-month extension which was met with furious backlash from the public, civil rights groups and both sides of politics.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison directly asked Mr Andrews last week to reconsider his proposal and urged him to seek monthly or quarterly prolongments instead.</p>

<p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Mr Andrews had 'a lot of questions to answer'.</p>

<p>Most recently, ex-prime minister Tony Abbott criticised Australia's handling of the crisis and accused Mr Andrews of wanting to extend a 'health dictatorship'.</p>

<p>Mr Abbott questioned whether strict lockdowns have been proportionate to the health risks, and said he hoped international borders would reopen by Christmas.</p>

<p>Speaking at the Policy Exchange think tank in London on Tuesday, Mr Abbott blamed the 'extraordinary ineptitude of the Victorian Government in the management of its hotel quarantine system' for Australia's outbreak.</p>
