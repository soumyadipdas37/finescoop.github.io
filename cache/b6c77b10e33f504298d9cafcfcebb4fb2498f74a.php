<p>So sweet! Lily James delighted fans on Sunday morning as she shared a sweet throwback of her as a child with her two brothers Charlie and Sam at the beach</p>

<p>Lily captioned the picture: 'There is so much I love about this photo. Not in the least my tie dye top, the mini rugby ball, the bowl hair cut, grins and the fact it appears as if my brilliant mother had triplets.. oh, and also my brothers.'  </p>

<p>The three children all appeared to be in good spirits as they perched on a wall at the seaside and posed for the snap.</p>

<p>Lily's brother Charlie could be seen sitting in the middle while holding the mini rugby ball while Sam showed off his teeth with a wide grin.</p>

<p>After posting the sweet picture, Lily replied to a comment saying: 'Charlie. Theres a photo of him proudly holding some sort of ball every year of his life. For sure.'</p>

<p>Stunning: The actress has starred in  films such as Mamma Mia, Darkest Hour and Cinderella as well as Downton Abbey (pictured at the British Independent Film Awards in London in 2019)</p>

<p>And it didn't take long for fans to share their excitement at getting a glimpse into the actress' childhood.</p>

<p>One showed they were amazed at how similar Lily looked now, writing: 'Same smile and everything.'</p>

<p>While another penned that the siblings were the 'perfect trio' before someone else added that the picture was 'really cute'. </p>

<p>Lily has previously spoken about her family, revealing the impact of losing her actor father James Thomson who died of cancer in 2008 at the age of 54.</p>

<p>Impressed: Lily's fans quickly replied to the snap with some saying she hadn't changed a bit since childhood</p>

<p>Adorable: Others replied that Lily and her two brothers made 'the perfect trio'</p>

<p>Family: Lily replied to one comment joking there must be photos of her brother Charlie holding a ball for every year of his life</p>

<p>The young actress changed her name from Lily Thomson to Lily James to honour her beloved father and said his death turned her into the workaholic she is today.</p>

<p>She also revealed that the loss of her father came on the heels of the death of his brother, Bruce, who had motor neurone disease, and of her grandmother, actress Helen Horton, who had returned to the US to care for her son. </p>

<p>'A lot of my family died in the space of five years,’ she told the Daily Telegraph magazine in 2019. ‘But I am glad that my grandma died before my dad, because if she had seen that…’ </p>

<p>Father and daughter: The young actress changed her name from Lily Thomson to Lily James to honour her beloved dad</p>

<p>Lily also spoke about how the role of Cinderella in Kenneth Branagh’s reworking of the fairytale was a delight – until she had to play a scene in which she is told that her father is dead.</p>

<p>‘I couldn’t really go there,’ she said. ‘Sometimes there was a coldness to me around that. I was trying so hard to hold on to something.’</p>

<p>Even though it has been more than a decade since her father died, Lily said that she still finds it difficult to speak about her hero.</p>

<p>‘He was so artistic and so bold. There was so much life in him. He was brilliant,’ she said.</p>

<p>‘Sometimes when I speak I feel relaxed, I feel completely at peace and calm. But there are other times when I feel more on edge.’   </p>
