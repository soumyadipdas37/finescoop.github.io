<p>Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday raised concerns about New York City's skyrocketing gun violence rates, saying crime is 'not going to get better on its own'</p>

<p>According to recent NYPD crime statistics, New York City has seen the number of shooting incidents and shooting fatalities nearly double so far this year compared to last year. </p>

<p>Between January 1 and September 20, a total of 1,123 shootings resulting in 214 fatalities were reported in the Big Apple, compared with 580 shootings and 111 fatalities for the same period in 2019.   </p>

<p>During a press conference on Tuesday, Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took a swipe at Mayor Bill de Blasio, citing a host of quality-of-life issues plaguing New York City under his leadership, including rising gun violence rates, rampant homelessness and garbage piling up in the streets. </p>

<p>'We have a problem in New York City when it comes to crime. That is fact,' Cuomo said, as Fox News reported. 'It's not going to get better on its own.' </p>

<p>In July and August, shootings were up 177 and 166 per cent, respectively, compared to the same time last year.</p>

<p>Other major cities in the US also have seen rising crime rates. According to a study by the Council on Criminal Justice, from May-June 2020, homicides in 20 cities increased by 37 per cent, led by Chicago, Philadelphia and Milwaukee, reported CNN.  </p>
