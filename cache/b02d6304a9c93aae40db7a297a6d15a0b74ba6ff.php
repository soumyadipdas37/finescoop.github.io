<p>Fulham players are backing Scott Parker's annoyance at Tony Khan's post-match apology</p>

<p>Khan took to social media to say sorry for Fulham's display in a 3-0 defeat by Aston Villa</p>

<p>And Sportsmail understands that numerous Fulham players have also been angered by Khan's comments.</p>

<p>A source said: 'The players are not happy at all with the post. It undermines the squad and it looks like they don't have the club's backing.'</p>

<p>During his post-match press conference after the defeat by Villa, Parker played a straight bat towards questions regarding Khan's social media activity. </p>

<p>Sportsmail understands numerous Fulham players have been angered by Khan's comments</p>

<p>But having had time to digest the comments, the Cottagers boss said on Tuesday: 'People have the platform. You own a football club, you can decide how you want to communicate or send a message out.</p>

<p>'It's not something I agree with, it's not helpful from that sense but like I said that's down to the owner and how he sees it.</p>

<p>'There's one thing that I'm disappointed with and that's how he's actually apologising for the performance and that is something that I don't agree with and he shouldn't have.</p>

<p>'The performance last night was a good performance which was a group of players who have done everything they can, worked tirelessly from the first minute to the 95th. </p>

<p>Parker publicly voiced his displeasure at the owner's comments, branding them 'unhelpful'</p>

<p>'At 3-0 down they were still trying to work as much as they can to try and get us back in the game and for that I don't agree with him.</p>

<p>'I'll be the first to have an issue with my squad and my team and my players if I felt that that was something which needed to be criticised.</p>

<p>'So I have an issue with that and obviously that's something which I don't agree with.'</p>

<p>Fulham will make signing new defenders a priority ahead of the transfer deadline, with Wolves centre back Ryan Bennett understood to be on the club's radar. </p>
