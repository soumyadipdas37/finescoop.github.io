<p>New venture: Simon Cowell is planning a Christmas Britain's Got Talent special to help boost ITV ratings over the festive period</p>

<p>The show will reportedly be pre-recorded next month after the BGT final and talent bookers are already approaching former acts from the popular show to take part.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Simon has not done Christmas before and ITV jumped at the chance to put Britain's Got Talent at the very heart of their festive schedule.</p>

<p>'It does huge ratings, so why not unleash it at a different time of year to mix things up a bit.</p>

<p>'The show will be a jam-packed full of Christmas cheer and music. It will not be a competition as such but a celebration of the show.'</p>

<p>The source added: 'It would be great if Simon could make it but if not, he has an able deputy.' </p>

<p>It is hoped that the show could bring in higher TV ratings for ITV, as the BBC usually dominates over the festive period.</p>

<p>Simon was forced to pull out the current BGT series after breaking his back in a electric bike accident in Malibu, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. </p>

<p>The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest.  </p>

<p>Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, 'Where there's a will, there's a way!'</p>

<p>'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.' </p>

<p>Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. </p>

<p>The BGT semi-finals, which had been due to be held in May, are now taking place over five, nail-biting – and pre-recorded - episodes. The final will then take place live in October. </p>

<p>As usual, Ant and Dec are hosting the semi-finals whilst Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams are joining stand in Ashley Banjo at the judges' desk.</p>

<p>Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.</p>

<p>With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences' reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.</p>

<p>The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain's Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.</p>
