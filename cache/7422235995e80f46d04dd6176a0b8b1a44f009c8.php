<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has revealed that he was won over by Donny van de Beek's attitude after seeing Manchester United's new £40million signing 'headbutt' one of his Molde players five years ago.</p>

<p>Van de Beek scored his first goal for Ajax in a 1-1 draw with Solskjaer's side in the Europa League in December 2015, but suffered a nasty cut close to his left eye as he headed the ball goalwards and collided with Molde defender Joona Toivio.</p>

<p>It impressed the Norwegian coach who kept a close eye on Van de Beek's career before bringing him to United last week after speaking to former United goalkeeper and Ajax chief executive Edwin van der Sar.</p>

<p>'I followed Donny,' said Solskjaer. 'He scored his first goal against Molde in the Europa League in 2015. We drew 1-1 at the Amsterdam Arena and he scored a fantastic header.</p>

<p>'He actually headbutted my centre-back so he was very brave as well. It was at the start of the game so I liked his infectious attitude. He has a smile on his face and when you see players with that drive and desire that is one way you need to use your eye.</p>

<p>'But I have spoken to Edwin van der Sar and other players that know him. You just use the people you know and trust to scout the character.</p>

<p>'He is a versatile, intelligent player and he's got loads of energy and enthusiasm. He is developing all the time.</p>

<p>Norwegian coach was won over by the midfielder's attitude during the Europa League clash</p>

<p>'He scores goals and we need to add goals from midfield. Our forwards scored quite a few goals last season, and Bruno (Fernandes) came in and scored goals, but we need goals throughout the squad and the team because we didn't score enough to be challenging at the top.</p>

<p>'He will add his creativity. He has a good reading and understanding of the game, he can see space and arrives at the right time. His timing is fantastic.'</p>

<p>United have a delayed start to the new season after reaching the semi-finals of the Europa League last month, and Solskjaer insists he is looking forward to the new campaign despite the quick turnaround.</p>

<p>'I had four days back in Norway, so that was my holiday this summer,' he told the BBC. 'That is a different thing for me. You have not have had time to recover mentally as you normally would and think about new ideas.</p>

<p>'But, of course, we are looking forward to the new season. It's just come so quickly from last season. This preparation is very different to what we normally have.</p>

<p>'With all the games we had in the Europa League, we almost had to take that as our pre-season. Then we had to give the boys a few weeks off and now we are getting ready.</p>

<p>'We have a one week later start which means we can get one friendly game in, and that is very different to any other season I've been preparing for.</p>

<p>'It's going to be about match time and getting their sharpness back. I don't anticipate too many players will have lost too much in those weeks that they have had off because they have always been good at looking after themselves.</p>

<p>'It's just about getting that feeling of your legs burning a bit and your lungs hurting a bit and getting on to the pitch again.' </p>
