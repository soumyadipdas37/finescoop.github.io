<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hotels in the quirky resort of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight’s south coast have enjoyed their share of the limelight: Queen Victoria frequented the Royal Hotel for afternoon tea, while The Hambrough caused a flurry of foodie excitement when it gained a Michelin star in 2009.</p>

<p>At the bottom of St Boniface Down, another hotel is shaking things up, its thatched-cottage exterior belying an uber-cool interior that feels foreign on the island’s tradition-lapped shores.</p>

<p>The Scandi-chic decor of Hillside makes sense when you meet the charismatic Danish owner, Gert Bach, who has created a minimalist world of stripped-back oak floors, monochrome furnishings and Klint lamps. Stark white walls act as a backdrop for huge canvases of abstract art from the Cobra movement.</p>

<p>Culture clash: Hillside, located in the quirky resort of Ventnor on the Isle of Wight’s south coast, has a traditional thatched-cottage exterior</p>

<p>Just as eye-popping are the sea views over lawns that tumble downhill to impressive vegetable gardens. These form the backbone of Hillside’s food ethos – using local produce to create a short menu of delectable dishes (it doesn’t get much better than their garden soup). </p>

<p>Gert sources his wine in France, and very good it is too – the rosé seems made to be enjoyed sitting by the lily pond before you move inside to feast on dinner served at wooden tables with wishbone chairs.</p>

<p>Breakfast is also surprisingly good for a place with just 12 rooms plus a couple of apartments; the superb buffet features honey from the garden hives (they also keep chickens, doves and three black sheep).</p>

<p>Scandi-chic: The bedrooms feature white decor with splashes of colour from artwork, fresh flowers and blue water bottles </p>

<p>Hillside, Ventnor, Isle of Wight. B&amp;B doubles cost from £156 a night, with a minimum two-night stay (hillsideventnor.co.uk).</p>

<p>Then it’s just an amble across the art-filled hall to read the papers in the Snug, with its black seating, wood-burner and framed photographs from Hillside’s past – it has been a hostelry since the 1800s. I pause before one sepia photograph entitled ‘Hillside boarding establishment’. My, how things have changed.</p>

<p>The rooms: Think pale but interesting, the white decor given splashes of colour by the artwork, fresh flowers and blue glass water bottles. Comfortable Vispring beds have 420-thread count linen, goose-down duvets and woollen blankets. Bathrooms are compact but adequate; eight rooms have a sea view. Checkout is early at 10am.</p>

<p>The food: It’s all about the taste rather than too much twiddling, in dishes that might include a crab ramekin with local bread, ham and chicken pie with garden veg and a hot chocolate brownie with ice cream (three courses £25 to £30). It was the stand- out meal of summer for my son and me.</p>

<p>The USP: Scandi chic just a short walk from a secret beach. Leave the crowds at Ventnor and take the 20-minute coastal route to Steephill Cove, a delightful throwback to beaches of yesteryear.  </p>
