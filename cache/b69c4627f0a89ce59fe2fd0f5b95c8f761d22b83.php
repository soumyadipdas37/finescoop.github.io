<p>The Paris Saint-Germain forward will leave the France national squad and return home.</p>

<p>Didier Deschamps' side now are set to face Croatia on Tuesday night in the Nations League without their star man.</p>

<p>Kylian Mbappe has tested positive for coronavirus according to French outlet Telefoot</p>

<p>Mbappe is also set to miss PSG's fixtures away to Lens on September 10 and at home to Marseille on September 13.   </p>

<p>The World Cup winner has this week warned PSG that they must spend money on new recruits in order to win the Champions League next season.</p>

<p>The Ligue 1 champions fell short in the Champions League final last month in a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in Lisbon. PSG graduate Kingsley Coman score the only goal of the game, as Mbappe struggled to have much impact.</p>

<p>Whilst Neymar confirming that he will stay in the French capital is a big boost to their Champions League hopes next season, Mbappe believes there is still a need for more additions to their squad.</p>

<p>'Of course I am optimistic that we will win the Champions League. We have to because, if we don't believe it, no one is going to believe it for us,' Mbappe told Telefoot. </p>

<p>'It's football and you have to get over it. Lots of teams lost a final and won the year after. Obviously, PSG grew up with this final. Before, we had this block of the quarter-finals, now we broke that.</p>

<p>'You have to recruit well, you have to buy players. I hope we will have good recruits and that we can restart the season with the aim of doing better.'</p>
