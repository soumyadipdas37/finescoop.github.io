<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother dubbed 'Karen from Brighton' has announced she is leaving Victoria forever in her latest protest against lockdown regulations.</p>

<p>Jodi Grollo became an overnight social media sensation in July when she appeared on TV whinging about being bored running laps of her affluent coastal suburb. </p>

<p>She embraced her new status as a minor celebrity and established Instagram profile 'The Real Karen From Briiighton' to openly slam state premier Daniel Andrews and to show off her glamorous lifestyle.</p>

<p>In her latest video on Wednesday night, 'Karen' swigged from a bottle of iconic state beer Victoria Bitter while publicising her untimely departure from 'Dantoria' for the boundless pastures of Queensland, in song.</p>

<p>In her latest video on Wednesday night, 'Karen' swigged from a bottle of iconic state beer Victoria Bitter while publicising her untimely departure from 'Dantoria'</p>

<p>To the tune of John Denver's 'Leaving on a Jet Plane', she crooned: 'I am leaving on a jet plane, I don't think that I'll be back again.'</p>

<p>'I really don't want to go, but Dan is just so full of s**t.</p>

<p>'I mean, seriously, now he is just taking the p*ss.</p>

<p>'And why are we listening to all those flogs that 'don't know' - seriously, 'I don't know', 'I can't recall', 'it wasn't me,' 'I don't remember'.</p>

<p>'Bugger off. I am over. I am done. I am out.</p>

<p>'Cheers, Victoria.'</p>

<p>Ms Grollo embraced her new status as a minor celebrity and established Instagram profile 'The Real Karen From Briiighton' to openly slam state premier Daniel Andrews</p>

<p>Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews (pictured) has been heavily criticised for the lockdowns in Melbourne</p>

<p>Queensland officials have banned anyone who has touched coronavirus-addled Victoria within 14 days from entering the state, but the daughter of billionaire pokies tycoon Bruce Mathieson has found a loophole.</p>

<p>The heiress will spend two weeks at Howard Springs quarantine facility near Darwin, Northern Territory, nullifying her status a hotspot resident and leaving her free to re-brand as 'Karen from Queensland'. </p>

<p>Ms Groll also took the social media opportunity to take a swipe at the Sunshine State premier Annastacia Palaszczuk. </p>

<p>'Anastasia isn't that much better than Dan, but the weather is great and life is pretty much normal up there,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Such a shame because I really love Melbourne.' </p>

<p>The Real Karen from Briiighton has grown to more than 13,000 Instagram followers</p>

<p>Her son set up an Instagram account for her to show off her glamorous lifestyle and poke fun at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews</p>

<p>The post was inundated with messages of support from some of her 13,000 followers.</p>

<p>'Cheers to you for keeping it real and having the balls to stand up to Despot Dan,' one fan wrote.</p>

<p>'Good on you Karen! We did two weeks of hotel quarantine in Sydney and were freed a week ago. Best decision we made to get out although heartbroken for my home state. Good luck and enjoy living again,' another shared.</p>

<p>'Kaz we need you to run for premier, daily singalongs and a far better memory then the dodgy Dan crowd in at the moment,' someone else suggested.</p>

<p>A string of strict stage four lockdown restrictions were relaxed in Melbourne on Monday in response to a drop in infection rates. </p>

<p>There are currently 21 coronavirus cases from an unknown source in Melbourne and none in regional Victoria. </p>

<p>The Real Karen from Briiighton is pictured f leaning against the kitchen bench drinking red wine straight from the carafe</p>

<p>The melodic announcement is one of many penned by Ms Groll amid her burning frustration with the 'Dandemic'.</p>

<p>Earlier in September, she uploaded a photo of herself leaning against the kitchen bench drinking red wine straight from the carafe, which was captioned with reworded lyrics to The Eagles' classic Hotel California.</p>

<p>Described as an 'original Karen song', the opening chorus line of Welcome to Hotel California was replaced with 'Welcome to the Socialist State of Victoria.' </p>

<p>The rest of the chorus was littered with references to six weeks of stage four lockdowns in Melbourne, which had been extended another two weeks at the time. </p>

<p>She initially went viral when she said she had trudged through all of the streets of Brighton and therefore was ignoring instructions for people not to travel across town for exercise or any other outing.</p>

<p>Ms Groll previously posted a video to her Instagram story\, which has since been deleted, of her preparing for the original 'Battle of the Karens'</p>

<p>The video shows her taking on a punching bag with boxing glove before slamming a beer and throwing the empty can to the ground</p>

<p>'Well, you get sick of walking the same streets. You know, I've done all of Brighton,' she told Nine News while walking the city's Tan Track in July.</p>

<p>Previous posts on 'The Real Karen from Briiighton' page included showing off her lockdown stash of booze, social distancing outside a cafe and punching boxing bags at her local gym with a swipe at Premier Andrews.</p>

<p>'I'll dodge him faster then he dodges questions about hotel quarantine. I'll lock him down like Victoria,' she wrote. </p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has previously slammed Melburnians who complained about the stay-at-home orders amid a second wave of COVID-19 infections.</p>

<p>Ms Grollo said she was not bothered by Mr Andrews' rebuke, or the hundreds of angry comments online, and hadn't seen them anyway.</p>

<p>'I'm not on social media so I didn't see any [of the backlash]. To be honest, I found it funny – it made my weekend,' she previously told The Herald Sun. </p>
