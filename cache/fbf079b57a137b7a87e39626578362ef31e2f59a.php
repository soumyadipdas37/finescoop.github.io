<p>Scott has been spending a ton of time with ex Kourtney and their children in recent months following his split from girlfriend of three-years Sofia Richie, 22, in May. </p>

<p>Kourtney and Scott, who split in 2015 after nine-years together, not only share Penelope and Reign, but also 10-year-old son Mason.</p>

<p>Scott briefly reconnected with Sofia as they attended a Fourth Of July party in Malibu together.</p>

<p>But, shortly after, the pair split 'for good' and a source told Us Weekly at the time that their '15-year age difference' may have been an issue.   </p>

<p>'He's in a very much different place in his life, really focused on a more quiet lifestyle, his kids and his investment businesses and Sofia, at 21 years old, is really still trying to figure what she wants to do, which drove them apart over time,' they explained to the outlet.</p>
