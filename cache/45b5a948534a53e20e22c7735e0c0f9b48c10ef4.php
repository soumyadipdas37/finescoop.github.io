<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She has reportedly called her arch rival Rebekah Vardy's 'strong-armed tactics' to speed up their £1million lawsuit 'laughable'. </p>

<p>And Coleen Rooney put on a cheerful display as she stepped out of The Style Lounge hair salon in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, on Friday.</p>

<p>The WAG, 34, appeared to be in good spirits following her pampering session, her second in a row after previously being seen at the hairdressers on Thursday.</p>

<p>Amused: Coleen Rooney put on a cheerful display as she left her salon in Cheshire on Friday... after finding Rebekah Vardy's 'tactics to speed up £1million lawsuit laughable'</p>

<p>Coleen put on a casual display for the outing, as she paired a simple black t-shirt with denim jeans that fit snugly on her slender legs.</p>

<p>She completed the look by shrugging on a black blazer over a grey hoodie, while she decided to forgo bringing a bag to keep her personal items. </p>

<p>The brunette beauty's locks were brushed into a sleek, straight style after her session at the hairdressers, and she accessorised with a pair of gold hoop earrings. </p>

<p>Coleen could be seen carrying a grey face mask in her hands rather than wearing it as she walked down the street. </p>

<p>Treating herself: The WAG appeared to be in good spirits following her pampering session, her second in a row after previously being seen at the hairdressers on Thursday</p>

<p>Comfy: Coleen put on a casual display for the outing, as she paired a simple black t-shirt with denim jeans that fit snugly on her slender legs</p>

<p>Cosy: Coleen completed the look by shrugging on a black blazer over a grey hoodie, while she decided to forgo bringing a bag to keep her personal items</p>

<p>Her outing comes as the mother-of-four has reportedly declared she 'won't be bullied' by Rebekah, 38, when their libel case goes to court. </p>

<p>Rebekah is said to have signed legal papers in a bid to get Coleen to head to court 'immediately' amid their ongoing WAG war.  </p>

<p>But a source told The Sun last weekend that 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'</p>

<p>Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'.</p>

<p>Stylish: The brunette beauty's locks were brushed into a sleek, straight style after her session at the hairdressers, and she accessorised with a pair of gold hoop earrings</p>

<p>Choice: Coleen could be seen carrying a grey face mask in her hands rather than wearing it as she walked down the street</p>

<p>Delighted: Coleen smiled brightly as she headed out of the salon</p>

<p>It was reported last month that Rebekah filed the papers under the impression that Coleen is 'dragging her heels' following her bombshell accusations she has been selling stories about her to The Sun. </p>

<p>According to reports, the session, which will be held later this year, will determine whether the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy was 'libelled' when Coleen accused her Instagram account of leaking stories to the press. </p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'Things have been rumbling on for ages, and costs ­spiralling too.</p>

<p>Hitting out: Her outing comes as the mother-of-four has reportedly declared she 'won't be bullied' by Rebekah, 38, when their libel case goes to court</p>

<p>Confident: Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'</p>

<p>'This will mean that a judge can actually get to the crux of the case — and make those involved put up or shut up. It should mean things can finally get moving and dealt with quickly.</p>

<p>'This is a shot across the bows. It effectively says, "Come on, stop mucking about, let’s get on with this".'</p>

<p>MailOnline reached out to Rebekah and Coleen's representatives for comment at the time of publication. </p>

<p>The two are currently engaged in an ongoing feud which began when Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies.</p>

<p>Rival: Rebekah (pictured in February) is said to have signed legal papers in a bid to get Coleen to head to court 'immediately' amid their ongoing WAG war</p>
