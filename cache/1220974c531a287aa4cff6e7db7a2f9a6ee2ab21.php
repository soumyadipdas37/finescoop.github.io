<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Vegan activists wearing fake blood-spattered shirts have rallied outside a Hog's Breath Cafe with megaphones, screaming 'animals do not want to die'.</p>

<p>Noisy demonstrators from the Brisbane branch of militant animal rights group Direct Action Everywhere arrived at the Cleveland steak house on Sunday afternoon to urge diners to reconsider their diets.</p>

<p>Armed with signs and fake blood, the group marched along the promenade toward the alfresco table settings at the franchise.</p>

<p>Leah Doellinger, a group member who has copped numerous charges for actions associated with the vegan group, filmed the event.</p>

<p>'We're going to the Hog's Breath Cafe to speak to the public as say that we, as a society, have blood on our hands,' she told the camera while walking to the protest.</p>

<p>The demonstration protest began with a siren to capture the attention of the crowd before a leader started lecturing unwilling participants about the treatment of live stock in Australia.</p>

<p>Activists with fake blood stained hands stood in line formation out the front of the restaurant donning signs and TV screens showing footage from inside slaughter houses. </p>

<p>What began as murmurs from the crowd to the tune of 'go away' and 'stop' quickly escalated as the extremist 14-strong group elevated their efforts. </p>

<p>'We're having chicken for dinner!' a child yelled in the background.</p>

<p>'F*** off,' said another.</p>

<p>'You're a d***head, mate,' added someone else.</p>

<p>Two group members began smearing fake blood from plastic bottles on the ground leaving a mess of crimson puddles and hand prints over the pebbles. </p>

<p>'We have blood on our hands,' a female member wearing fake leather boots shouted, before launching into a screeching tirade. </p>

<p>Ms Doellinger, who stood in front of the group to film the action, explained the group's ethos to angry diners who approached her for answers.</p>

<p>One frustrated diner from the restaurant grabbed a chair, aiming it at the male activist chanting into the loudspeaker </p>

<p>As tensions rose, the group began chanting: 'Humane slaughter is a lie, animals do not want to die'</p>

<p>'I eat animals. I kill them myself. I love it,' said one smiling man.</p>

<p>'You should be ashamed of yourself,' she replied. 'You're a cruel person.'</p>

<p>As tensions rose, the group began chanting: 'Humane slaughter is a lie, animals do not want to die.'</p>

<p>One frustrated diner from the restaurant grabbed a chair, aiming it at the male activist chanting into the loudspeaker.</p>

<p>He raised his hand in defence, as the diner yelled 'F*** off,' before walking inside.</p>

<p>As the group moved around the outdoor food precinct, irate members of the public pleaded with them to stop. </p>

<p>Another frustrated diner grew so enraged a scuffle broke out in the middle of the precinct</p>

<p>As members of the public and Direct Action Everywhere pulled the fighting pair apart, a group member said over the megaphone: 'We are not violent'</p>

<p>'Everyone's shouting. Stop the f***ing shouting,' one man begged.</p>

<p>'Your breath smells,' Ms Doellinger replied.</p>

<p>Another man grew so enraged a scuffle broke out.</p>

<p>As members of the public and Direct Action Everywhere pulled the fighting pair apart, a group member said over the megaphone: 'We are not violent'.</p>

<p>Vegans flocked to the comments section to congratulate the group for 'spreading  the truth'.</p>

<p>'Typical aggression from meat eaters. Happens every time! Animal activists are never violent. Loud... yes. But not violent. Typical male power trips,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'Great work guys! I got chills watching that,' another added. </p>

<p>Someone else said: 'Powerful disruption! Well done to everyone.'</p>

<p>What began as murmurs from the crowd to the tune of 'go away' and 'stop' quickly escalated as the extremist 14-strong group elevated their efforts</p>

<p>It wasn't the first time the Brisbane faction of the global activist group disrupted people's meals.</p>

<p>In January, protesters held up signs and repeated the chant 'it's not food, it's violence' in the middle of the Black Hide Steakhouse in the city. </p>

<p>The group live-streamed the protest to Facebook, urging animal rights supporters to share the video and spread their message.</p>

<p>Diners appeared uncomfortable as the group stood in the middle of the restaurant chanting and holding their signs.</p>

<p>Others stood out the front of the steakhouse confronting those who entered the restaurant with their message against meat.</p>

<p>The group are well known for their activities in Western Australia, where they have held several marches and protested outside abattoirs and butchers shops near Perth.  </p>
