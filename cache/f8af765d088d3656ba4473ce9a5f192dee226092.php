<p>On Wednesday, KJ shared a video recorded on set before a scene he filmed with Camila.</p>

<p>'Our new normal is washing our mouths before every take of a makeout scene...' he wrote.</p>

<p>In the clip, the two are handed identical tiny cups filled with liquid. He doesn't specify what's inside, though it is presumably mouthwash or alcohol to kill germs.</p>

<p>The two make a game of it, crossing their arms to pour the cups into their mouths at the same time.</p>

<p>Then, they swish. For a full minute, the pair keep the liquid in their mouths, as a woman off camera tells them how much time they have left.</p>

<p>The video has had quite a few comments, including from some of KJ's fellow Riverdale stars.</p>

<p>'That s*** burns,' wrote Lili Reinhart.</p>

<p>'Spit don't swallow,' wrote Skeet Ulrich.</p>

<p>Some fans, though, expressed disbelief that the actors weren't doing this before the pandemic, while costar Bernadette Beck asked that it become standard for kissing scenes.</p>

<p>Hollywood has found a few ways to operate safely during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Wait a minute! Some fans expressed disbelief that the actors weren't doing this before the pandemic</p>

<p>'So if you see hands touching faces in close proximity from a wide shot, instead of a stunt double we'll have a love-scene double, where it will be the husband or the wife doing the actual touching,' he said.</p>

<p>'Then when we edit it together, it will look like our couple on screen.'</p>

<p>As for sex scenes, they're using blow-up dolls in wigs and makeup.</p>

<p>'When we were reviewing the scripts, we started taking out all the romantic scenes and [the scripts] just fell flat,' he told the New York Post. 'We put our heads together trying to figure out a way to make these scenes work without breaking the eight-foot [distancing] rule...and we brought out a doll we used years ago as a corpse.'</p>
