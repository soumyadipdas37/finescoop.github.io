<p>The Frenchman returned to Old Trafford for the charity game having completed a stellar eight years with Manchester United, claiming 10 pieces of major silverware between 2006 and 2014.</p>

<p>The 39-year-old, who primarily played as a left-back during his career in the top flight, took on Mack on the right hand side of the pitch and embarrassed him by playing the ball through his legs for a marvellous nutmeg.</p>

<p>Sorry <?php echo e('@'); ?>LeeMack ! The main thing is we raise lots of money from soccer aid and of course we win the trophy too 😁😁😁If you can donate please do - https://t.co/MHDoTPNFTgpic.twitter.com/EZgSjypgP8</p>

<p>Having lined-up opposite Mack while playing for the World XI, Evra decided to take the amateur on one on one. </p>

<p>The five-time Premier League winner performed what looked like a conventional step over before slotting the ball through Mack's legs. </p>

<p>The former France international then darted around the celebrity to continue in the attack, leaving Mack with his tail between his legs. </p>

<p>Evra took to Twitter to share the humiliating clip saying: 'Sorry Lee Mack! The main thing is we raise lots of money from soccer aid and of course we win the trophy too.'</p>

<p>The 39-year-old embarrassed Mack with a marvellous nutmeg on the right side of the pitch</p>

<p>Fans were quick to take to Twitter to share their thoughts on Evra's impressive skills</p>

<p>Some fans even called for United's Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to lure Evra back to Old Trafford</p>

<p>Fans were quick to respond to the 39-year-old's skill, taking to social media to praise Evra and mock Mack.</p>

<p>One fan wrote: 'Nothing quite sums up English frustration more than watching Patrice Evra skin Lee Mack, and hearing Bradley Walsh complain from the touchline'.</p>

<p>While another one added: 'Patrice Evra with THE MOST DISRESPECTFUL nutmeg on Lee Mack ffs that was insane.'</p>

<p>Some supporters even called for Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to lure Evra back to Old Trafford. </p>

<p>Unfortunately for the comedian, that wasn't his only embarrassing moment during Sunday's charity match. </p>

<p>The 59-year-old comedian went on to miss a penalty for England for a third consecutive year</p>

<p>With game finishing 1-1, it went to penalties. Mack, who has played in Soccer Aid's charity match on several occasions, stepped up to take a penalty for England for a third year in a row.</p>

<p>However, three was certainly not a charm as the 52-year-old missed for a third consecutive year.</p>

<p>The game may have been damaging to Mack's pride, but Soccer Aid raised a record £11,552,577 – the most the match has ever generated in the history of the show. </p>

<p>Having officially retired from the top-flight last summer, Evra was recently spotted playing at left back for Brentham FC, who compete in the 11th tier of English football in the Middlesex County League.</p>

<p>Footage of the Evra surfaced on social media and once again showed that he has lost none of his skill. </p>
