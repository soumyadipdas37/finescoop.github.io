<p>The march started off at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and slowly moved towards the famous bridge</p>

<p>'This is extremely traumatizing. I have been out here since June, almost every day on the streets, marching for my Black life to show people that I matter, that it could be me, it could be him, it could be him, it could be any Black face that you see in this crowd,' protester Sophie Michel said to CBS2. </p>

<p>'I think we need to send a message that it's unacceptable that no one was charged with Breonna Taylor's death,' said John Donahue to PIX11. </p>

<p>Demonstrators have gathered across the country to express their anger after it was announced on Wednesday that the officers who shot the black woman in her Louisville, Kentucky apartment during a drug raid last March wouldn't be charged with her death.</p>

<p>Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers in Louisville who entered her home during a narcotics investigation in March. </p>

<p>He family spoke out on Friday night.</p>

<p>'I'm angry because this nation is learning that our Black women are dying at the hands of police officers,' said Bianca Austin, 'and this is not okay.' </p>

<p>'I was reassured Wednesday of why I have no faith in the legal system, in the police, in the law that are not made to protect us Black and brown people,' Austin read. </p>

<p>In Boston, demonstrators gathered in Nubian Square to at part of the nationwide protests. </p>

<p>The protest remained peaceful as they marched to the Boston Police Headquarters later in the night. The group then moved onto City Hall Plaza for a sit-in.  </p>

<p>The gathering appeared to be among the larger groups the city of Boston has seen in some time. </p>

<p>Some carried signs with messages such as 'Justice 4 Breonna,' 'Black Lives Matter,' and 'Let Black women dream.' </p>

<p>The demonstration was largely peaceful with no arrests had been reported as of 10:45pm.</p>

<p>'I feel like that message being sent that cops can do whatever they want and not be held accountable so this is just an attempt to reenergize the city and reenergize anyone that sees this to get back out on the streets to fight and increase the antiracist movement because this is not ok,' organizer Ernest Jacques Jr. said to WHDH.</p>

<p>The mayor of Boston Marty Walsh urged calm and asked demonstrators to respect the city ahead of the protest.   </p>

<p>'I'm asking people planning to demonstrate in Boston tonight and over the weekend to respect the city and respect each other,' he said. 'I'm asking you to keep it peaceful, I'm asking you to keep it powerful. People are deeply upset, but we cannot turn to violence to express our pain.'</p>

<p>'We want to maintain law and order and at the same time protect everyone's ability to peacefully assembler and make their voices heard. So in case, there is a need for us we're a little bit closer than we were perhaps in May,' Lt. Colonel Bryan Pillai said. </p>

<p>'Start charging police officers for murder. You in your house sleeping, you ain't safe. Usually the rebuttal is don't fight the police, cooperate. How the hell do you do that sleeping?' community activist Monica Cannon-Grant said to NBC Boston.  </p>

<p>A group of about 40 to 50 demonstrators were organizing in front of the superior court in downtown at around 7:30pm San Diego Police said.</p>

<p>The group then started marching on downtown streets chanting, 'No Justice, No Peace,' and chanting Breonna Taylor's name.</p>

<p>In Louisville, the city's police chief is urging armed militia to stay away from this weekend's protest.</p>

<p>'Many of them say they are coming to help us. Let me be clear, that is not help we need. That is not help we want,' said Rob Schroeder, interim police chief of the LMPD. </p>

<p>'America at large will not stand by and allow a Black woman to be murdered and have no consequences,' protester Kimberly Bernard said.</p>

<p>When asked if he would release the grand jury's report and transcript, the Kentucky Attorney General said he would revisit the question after the FBI finishes its independent investigation.</p>
