<p>Radiant: Cara De La Hoyde offered a candid insight into her breastfeeding journey as she admitted to being plagued with 'questions and worries' in a lengthy Instagram post</p>

<p>Cara penned a lengthy caption alongside a snap of her breastfeeding baby Delilah explaining that she received plenty of help and support from other mothers on a parenting app.</p>

<p>She also explained that she didn't breastfeed her son Freddie due to his 'tongue tie,' and so nursing her daughter was a completely new experience.</p>

<p>She wrote: 'We all have that one family member or friend who thinks they know better and when you ask that one silly question, you’re going to be reminded of it forever. </p>

<p>'For me it was about breastfeeding. Although I’m not a first time mum, with Fred I could never grasp the knack of breastfeeding due to his tongue tie and me just not knowing how to do it. </p>

<p>Open: The Love Island star spoke openly about the struggles with nursing her baby daughter Delilah, for the first time, before getting support from other mums through a parenting app</p>

<p>'This time with Delilah I have been lucky enough that she and I have taken to it like a duck to water and it seems like the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>'Although the latch is good and she’s feeding well, I still had so many questions when it came to expressing so I could get back to having some independence. A friend recommended I join the <?php echo e('@'); ?>peanut app, so I could get advice from other mums about breastfeeding. </p>

<p>'I found it so reassuring that the app had groups especially for breastfeeding mums where I could ask all the questions I had like: What's the best time to pump? Should I change my diet? How to reheat my milk? </p>

<p>'I was able to get answers to all of these questions thanks to the amazing mums and women on the app. </p>

<p>'Delilah has also suffered a lot with colic, so being able to talk to other mums that are going through this with their LO's and get advice has been so reassuring. </p>

<p>Cute: Cara added that she didn't breastfeed her son Freddie due to his 'tongue tie,' and so nursing her daughter was a completely new experience</p>

<p>'It's helped me know that there is light at the end of the tunnel and I'm not alone with my questions and worries. </p>

<p>'If you're trying for a baby, pregnancy, or already a mum, I recommend you join <?php echo e('@'); ?>peanut. It's the best friends and shoulder to cry on that we all need throughout.' </p>

<p>Cara previously admitted she's felt extreme 'mum guilt' with her oldest child Freddie, two, over the amount of time she's spent with her baby girl, who has been suffering with colic.</p>

<p>In a candid Q&amp;A session on her Instagram on Tuesday, the Love Island star, 30, admitted that the struggles that they've faced with 'colic baby' have 'put her off' having more children straight away.  </p>

<p>Mum of two: The star welcomed her second child Delilah in July, and is already mum to son Freddie, two</p>

<p>Cara has been very open with her fans throughout her motherhood journey and this week opened the floor up to questions on how she's coping as a mother of two.</p>

<p>The star, who last month admitted that she had had a 'really tough week' juggling Freddie's behavior and Delilah's colic, told how she has felt guilty for spending lot of time with her daughter. </p>

<p>After a fan asked if she felt guilty for her first child after having a second, Cara replied: 'Mum guilt has been in overdrive the last few weeks.</p>

<p>'Especially because I'm exclusively breastfeeding and with the colic on top Delilah is taking up so much of my time.</p>

<p>'I'm trying to do as much with him as I can when she sleeps &amp; I try to bath and put him to bed every night.'</p>

<p>Cute: Cara previously admitted she's felt extreme 'mum guilt' with her oldest child Freddie over the amount of time she's spent with her baby girl, who has been suffering with colic</p>

<p>With a new baby in the household, the reality beauty explained how little Freddie had been 'acting out' of late and had even been 'swearing' as he sought more attention from his parents.</p>

<p>Responding to a question of how Freddie was coping having to 'share' her, Cara said: 'Not well at all, it's been really hard, he been acting out, swearing and in general doing anything to get out attention (which has mostly been him being naughty)</p>

<p>'But it's a learning process for us all and it's getting better everyday! He loves Delilah so much just not me and nath so much sometimes.'  </p>

<p>The TV star also went on to discuss her baby girl's colic in more detail, and admitted that at times she hasn't coped 'very well' and had been in a lot of tears.</p>

<p>Responding to a fan who asked how she's coped with it, Cara said honestly: 'Not gonna lie, sometimes not very well, had lots of tears and had to walk away alot when it's too much.</p>

<p>'We've tried infacol, I've changed my diet, I'm also looking into taking her to an osteopath &amp; lots of passing her between us and taking turns. But my goodness it really is awful.' </p>

<p>Challenging: Cara recently shared a glimpse of the work-life juggle as she breastfed Delilah while having her makeup done</p>
