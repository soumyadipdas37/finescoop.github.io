<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Edouard Mendy is currently undergoing a medical ahead of his £22m move to Chelsea from Rennes, Blues boss Frank Lampard has confirmed. </p>

<p>The 28-year-old goalkeeper is set to sign a five-year contract at Stamford Bridge and will compete with under-fire keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga for the No 1 jersey. </p>

<p>Lampard confirmed the Senegalese would be a Chelsea player subject to being given the all-clear following the medical test and is hopeful he will be able to feature as soon as this weekend, against West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday. </p>

<p>Edouard Mendy is currently undergoing a medical ahead of his £22m move to Chelsea </p>

<p>Frank Lampard praised the role of technical and performance advisor Petr Cech in the deal</p>

<p>Former Blues goalkeeper Cech was instrumental in bringing Mendy to Stamford Bridge </p>

<p>'As far as I'm aware, as long as he passes his test with us on Thursday and if that is negative then he should be okay to play,' Lampard said. </p>

<p>The Chelsea manager also praised technical and performance advisor Petr Cech for his role in bringing Mendy to the club.</p>

<p>'Petr was important in that. It's a particular position and he has had a big say and was very instrumental'.'</p>

<p>Chelsea keeper Kepa Arrizabalaga made another costly error during the defeat to Liverpool</p>

<p>The Chelsea manager was however sympathetic towards Arrizabalaga's situation following a string of high-profile mistakes, the latest being against Liverpool on Sunday.  </p>

<p>'I think competition is a regular thing at a club like Chelsea,' Lampard added. </p>

<p>'The goalkeeper situation isn’t always as clear-cut as that. Kepa himself wants to improve his own performances.</p>

<p>The mistake came after Kepa let Leandro Trossard's shot squirm under him against Brighton</p>

<p>'It’s in everyone’s hands to push and develop to try and get in the team. I am not making any final statements at all in this minute.</p>

<p>'It is the hardest position because of the individual nature of it and mistakes get punished with goals. I understand that and as a manager I have to be sympathetic to that point. I am very aware of that.' </p>

<p>Before the West Brom clash though, Chelsea entertain Barnsley in the Carabao Cup third round at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday evening.  </p>
