<p>TV host Steph McGovern, pictured on the set of her talk show Steph's Packed Lunch, from Leeds, said some people assume she is dating a man and ask her about 'her fella'</p>

<p>'I had someone coming to me the other day asking "so what does your fella thinks about blablabla..," she told Suzi. </p>

<p>She said she never had a big coming out moment because she did not like labels.</p>

<p>'I've never officially come out,' she said, adding she had dated both men and women. </p>

<p>'I didn't do this big thing of "I am gay", like my mate Reg did,' she said. </p>

<p>She added that while she thought it was a 'big cliche,' she simply 'loved people' and did not feel like putting a name on it.  </p>

<p>'I just kinda go with the flow of things, and I did not really overthought it,' she added.  </p>

<p>She explained that it stemmed from the fact she was trying to live as normal a life as possible outside of her work in TV. </p>
