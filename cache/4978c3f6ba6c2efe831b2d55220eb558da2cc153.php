<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian tennis star Nick Kyrgios has reignited his fight with six-time grand slam winner Boris Becker with a scathing attack on social media.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old posted a throwback photo to his time playing with Team World in the Laver Cup on Wednesday, sparking the German legend to rile his up.</p>

<p>Kyrgios captioned the post 'different breed', before Becker commented 'in your dreams'.</p>

<p>The world number 42 bounced back at the 52-year-old, commenting that Becker was 'hating like a little groupie'.</p>

<p>Nick Kyrgios (pictured at the Laver Cup) has called Boris Becker 'desperate' in their latest social media tirade</p>

<p>'Lingering around like a bad smell, maybe hoping to get more likes and follows. Unfortunately never be as influential,' Kyrgios wrote.</p>

<p>He wasn't finished on Instagram, with Kyrgios blasting Becker again on Twitter on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>'He’s gone from wanting to coach me, obviously for his desperate need of a pay check, to hating on my Instagram. Strange world we live in,' Kyrgios posted.</p>

<p>Becker went bankrupt in 2017, with Kyrgios saying 'nope' to his offer to coach him in 2019.</p>

<p>The pair have endured a consistent online feud in 2020, as Kyrgios has been outspoken of tennis stars and their behaviour amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>He famously called rival player Alex Zverev 'selfish' after footage emerged of the world number seven breaching social distancing to go dancing in a club in Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>The incident sparked Becker to label Kyrgios a 'rat'.</p>

<p>'Don’t like no #rats ! Anybody telling off fellow sportsman/woman is no friend of mine! Look yourself in the mirror and think your better than us,' Becker tweeted. </p>

<p>'Boris Becker is a bigger doughnut than I thought,' Kyrgios replied. 'Can hit a volley, obviously not the sharpest tool in the shed though.'</p>

<p>Kyrgios continued to tweet through the US Open, which he elected not to play in like several other top ranking players due to concerns relating to COVID-19.</p>

<p>He was critical of Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta, who reached the semi finals in New York, sparking Becker to take aim at the young Aussie. </p>

<p>'Nick Kyrgios should really shut up,' Becker told Eurosport. </p>

<p>'He has become a loudspeaker, criticizes other players and doesn't do anything himself. I don't know athletes like that.'</p>
