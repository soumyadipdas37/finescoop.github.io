<p>The soap star enthused: ‘I always wanted to have a baby, that’s what I’ve always wanted. I think it’s just made me a lot happier, and gives you perspective and helps you rationalise what’s important. I think it gives you a real purpose.</p>

<p>‘I feel like my girls make me feel like I can do anything. I love being a mum, I love everything of it. Sometimes I’m like “this is going to be really difficult” because I’m tired or whatever, but it is amazing as well and I really enjoy it. </p>

<p>She also said she would love to have two more children and is confident she can twist footballer partner Scott’s arm.</p>

<p>‘I really want to have four’, she said at the time. ‘I think Scott’s like “maybe three” but I don’t know, we’ll see how we go, but I definitely want more. I’m sure I’ll get my own way eventually.’ </p>

<p>In June, the actress took to her Instagram to announce she will no longer edit her pictures as she wants to set a confident example for her girls.</p>

<p>Helen who admitted her postpartum photos left her 'self-conscious', backed up her pledge by posing in a lacy pink lingerie set for a series of un-retouched snaps. </p>

<p>Helen, wrote on her Stories: 'My boobs have massively changed from pregnancies and nursing and has made me feel really self conscious the past year. My stomach has changed from my babies.' </p>

<p>Long term love: Helen and Preston player Scott have been in a realationship since 2009 and got engaged in May 2018</p>

<p>Helen later detailed why she decided to take the brave step, penning: 'I've decided to stop editing my pictures to be a better role model to my daughters. Beautiful lingerie set <?php echo e('@'); ?>pourmoiltd.</p>

<p>'I've been lucky enough to carry two healthy babies and nurse them both for nearly two years. My skin on my stomach has changed, my boobs massively have (no creepy comments from any creepy men here this is a post about body confidence for other women, I will just delete and block). </p>

<p>'The change in my boobs definitely has made me feel less confident in myself but I wouldn’t change a thing.</p>

<p>'I have cellulite, I don’t have a big bum I have edited it in the past as it’s something I am self conscious of. I’d look at other women on Instagram and put myself down for not looking like that' </p>
