<p>In August, Ashley hinted to E! News that she was looking forward to having a second baby.</p>

<p>'Oh my gosh, I'm yearning to have more children. I would say that if I could I would have a Darby dozen and have a whole football team of kids, just a slew of them running around,' she said.</p>

<p>In the same interview, she also divulged that Michael 'made it clear that he would be willing to have one more child.'</p>

<p>Shortly after she shared her pregnancy announcement, her RHOP costar Monique Samuels commented with, 'Congratulations!!!!!' </p>

<p>Infidelity rumors: The baby news followed allegations from her costar Candiace Dillard that Michael was seen in a strip club and claimed to have a boyfriend and a wife; shown in June 2019 while pregnant with Dean</p>

<p> More to come: 'I took it with a grain of salt... and then it unfolds and boy, does it unfold,' Ashley said in an interview with Entertainment Tonight from Sunday</p>

<p>The new baby news follows a slew of controversy surrounding Michael's alleged sexual transgressions and violence.</p>

<p>Most recently, Ashley's costar Candiace Dillard claimed that a friend texted her that Michael was out at a strip club.</p>

<p>'My girl is a bartender at the strip club and I came to see her. He was there with several strippers. He was talking about how he has a boyfriend and a wife. ... He was asking who he could take to a hotel nearby,' Candiace read off from her phone.</p>

<p>In an interview from Sunday with Entertainment Tonight, Ashley obliquely addressed the allegations. </p>

<p>'Obviously, Candiace and I have had our share of differences in the past, so I wasn't really keen on believing her from the beginning, because Candiace has said a lot of things that weren't true,' Ashley began. </p>

<p>'I took it with a grain of salt... and then it unfolds and boy, does it unfold,' she continued. 'I mean, there's, like, layers upon layers upon layers of it.'</p>

<p>Ashley went on to admit that Michael made a 'pretty significant' mistake, though she wouldn't say just what yet, but viewers will see the confrontation on an upcoming episode. </p>

<p>More misconduct: Previously, Michael was accused of groping a male cameraman on RHOP, though charges were dropped due to a lack of evidence </p>

<p>Previously, a cameraman on their reality series publicly claimed in 2018 that Michael had groped him during filming.</p>

<p>Charges of felony assault and misdemeanor improper sexual conduct were filed against him but later dropped due to a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>'When I got the news, I just froze,' Ashley said on RHOP while delving into the matter. 'It was not real that something like this was happening to my husband and I. My heart was racing, I was getting light headed. Like, this just can’t be my reality.'</p>

<p>Last year, Michael was alleged to have made a sexual comment about one of Housewives' husbands.</p>

<p>'After the night died down, Michael walked past us and said, "Yeah, I would suck his d**k,"' Robyn Dixon told Ashley on the show. 'You were there. You all were walking past us.'</p>

<p>Despite one of her fellow Housewives claiming Michael said it, Ashley adamantly denied he'd made the comment. </p>

<p>Inappropriate comment: Last year, he was alleged to have said he would like to fellate one of the Housewives' husbands</p>
