<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>One in ten British people say they 'can't be bothered' to be more eco-friendly as a new survey finds the average household uses 216 plastic haircare bottles a year. </p>

<p>A poll of 2,000 people revealed that the average family is throwing away dozens of empty plastic bottles of shampoo, conditioner, hairspray and gel.</p>

<p>A typical household will also go through 24 bottles of shower gel, 24 tubes of toothpaste, 12 bottles of moisturiser and 108 loo rolls each year.</p>

<p>Only about 60 per cent of this plastic waste from a range of toiletry products is actually being recycled, researchers found, with the rest going into landfill. </p>

<p>A third of those responding to the survey by Swiss beauty firm RÉDUIT admitted they don't consider the environmental impacts of their hair and beauty regime. </p>

<p>The survey also revealed that just 11 per cent of respondents simply 'can't be bothered' to make more sustainable changes to their buying habits.</p>

<p>While one in 10 admitted they 'don't care', nearly a fifth don't know how to improve and 23 per cent wouldn't know where to start if they were to make a change.</p>

<p>CEO of RÉDUIT Paul Peros said: 'Taking care of our hair and appearance is just part of our routine, and we often forget about the impact it can have.' </p>

<p>It wasn't just the containers the products come in - 41 per cent had no idea that chemicals from hair products going down the drain are bad for the evnironment. </p>

<p>In fact, a fifth of Brits will flush things like cotton buds, face wipes or sanitary products down the toilet and 38 per cent don't know face wipes contain plastics.</p>

<p>'Our study has shown how people will mindlessly use and bin plastic products, and not think about how they could make small switches which have a huge impact,' according to Peros.</p>

<p>'It can seem quite daunting at first - trying something new - but there's lots of ways you can make more sustainable changes with your hair and beauty regime.'</p>

<p>The survey also looked at general beauty behaviour - finding that men use more product to care for their hair than women. </p>

<p>It also emerged that the average adult will shampoo their hair four times a week, and use conditioner three times - with 13 per cent refusing to change to a more sustainable shampoo and conditioner for fear it might damage their locks.  </p>

<p>Of those that responded to the survey conducted by OnePoll - 61 per cent did say they felt guilty about the amount of plastic bottles they go through.  </p>

<p>More than half do try to be more eco-friendly, but admitted they are less strict when it comes to what they use to take care of their appearance and their hair.</p>

<p>In fact, just three in 10 have already looked to make a change in buying eco-friendly beauty products, the surveys  discovered.</p>

<p>One in five wouldn't consider switching to products which are kinder to the planet. </p>

<p>It isn't just toiletries that people are throwing away without recycling - the 'Everyday Plastic Survey' found that waste soared during lockdown.</p>

<p>British households threw away 25 per cent more food packaging, parcel bags and PPE, the survey revealed.</p>

<p>The 'Everyday Plastic Survey' saw 483 people record how much plastic waste they get through during an average week and found it was an about 128 pieces. </p>

<p>In total, the 179 homes accumulated nearly 23,000 bits of plastic rubbish, the survey revealed - with most destined for landfill or an incinerator. </p>

<p>Peros said it was a shame so many people seem to be unaware of the impact their beauty regimes have on the environment - not just from the plastic bottles.</p>

<p>'Many of the eco-friendly hair and beauty products out there aren't just good for the planet, but have lots of other benefits,' Peros said.</p>

<p>'They often last longer because of the way they are designed and are much easier to take away with you because they don't always consist of liquid shampoos and conditioners - so no more pesky spillages in your suitcase too.'</p>
