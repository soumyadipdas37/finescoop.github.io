<p>'I don't no when me or her sisters are gonna see her again, my abuser STILL manages to abuse me threw the courts and on a daily basis threw a 'court appointed' email that allows him access to me for him to say whenever whatever he wants.</p>

<p>'I share this because I no other mothers are going threw exactly the same thing right now, just no your not alone I feel your pain,and I won't stop talking and fighting to get justice for us all and our kids.</p>
