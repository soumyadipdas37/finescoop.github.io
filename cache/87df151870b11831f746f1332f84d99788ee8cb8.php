<p>Around a third of voting shareholders refused to back a package that handed chief executive Michael O'Leary £3.2million in the financial year that ended in March.</p>

<p>The rebellion came after concerns were raised over his £419,000 bonus – just shy of the £458,000 maximum he was entitled to.  But the remuneration plans passed as 65.8 per cent voted in favour.</p>

<p>Around a third of voting shareholders refused to back a package that handed Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary £3.2m in the financial year that ended in March</p>

<p>Advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said earlier this month that shareholders should vote against the remuneration plans.</p>

<p>It said that during the pandemic Ryanair has taken £600million from a Bank of England support scheme, put many of its staff on furlough, and plans to cut around 3,000 jobs. </p>

<p>Last month the business was forced to slash a fifth of its flights in September and October as bookings dropped because of new Covid-19 infection rates.</p>

<p>It is the second year in a row that O'Leary's pay has been only narrowly passed by shareholders.</p>

<p>Last year his pay package was even more controversial – only 51 per centof shareholders voted for it.</p>
