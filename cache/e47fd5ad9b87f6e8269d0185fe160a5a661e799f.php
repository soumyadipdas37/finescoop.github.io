<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A kinky couple have been barred from a gastropub in Cumbria after a sadomasochistic display on the terrace - in full view of diners. </p>

<p>The dominatrix had tied her 'slave' to a roof beam with a dog lead and was spanking him with a paddle on Sunday evening at The Mill in Ulverston.</p>

<p>The man was dressed in black fishnet stocking and suspenders and red knickers, while his mistress wore a black dress as she beat his bottom with a black paddle.</p>

<p>Customers who witnessed the sadomasochistic session filmed the bizarre episode and shared it online.</p>

<p>A dominatrix and her 'slave' have been banned from The Mill in Ulverston, Cumbria, after putting on a sadomasochistic session on the terrace in full display of customers</p>

<p>The sound of the spanking could be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers.</p>

<p>It is believed the couple had chosen a public venue to add to the exhibitionist thrill of the activity.</p>

<p>But the owner of The Mill has slammed the couple for their exhibitionism and barred them from the pub.</p>

<p>A picture on social media, also shows a message allegedly written by a member of staff after the incident.</p>

<p>It read: 'I sat them upstairs on the terrace, these lads came down that were sat up there ten minutes later telling us to go up and see what's happening - and she has him tied up with a dog lead on one of the beams, whipping him.'</p>

<p>The message also alludes to the fact that the man's genitalia was on display.</p>

<p>The couple are believed to be part of the BDSM community. BDSM refers to often erotic practices which can involve bondage, dominance or submission.</p>

<p>One witness wrote on Twitter: 'Why is there old blokes getting spanked in suspenders out back of The Mill in Ulverston?'</p>

<p>Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill (above), hit out at the couple, who he believes has ties to the Ulverston area, for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'</p>

<p>Shocked customers who witnessed the spanking session shared a video online. The sound of the spanking can be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers</p>

<p>Another Twitter user added: 'Unreal scenes coming from The Mill in Ulverston.'</p>

<p>The woman, a self confessed 'mistress', appeared to share the video of the act on Facebook, but has since been removed from the site.</p>

<p>It is not known whether she had deactivated her account, or if Facebook had suspended the profile.</p>

<p>Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill, believes the couple has ties to the Ulverston area and hit out at them for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'.</p>

<p>Mr Simpson added: 'As soon as we spotted this couple's activities they were told to leave our premises.</p>

<p>'They are now barred and having seen their post on social media the police have now contacted us for more information.</p>

<p>'We believe that the woman involved is Ulverston-based and we find it quite depressing that such people should seek to embarrass small local businesses in this manner for financial gain.'</p>
