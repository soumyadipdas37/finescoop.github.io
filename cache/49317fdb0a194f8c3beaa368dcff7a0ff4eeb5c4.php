<p>Ms Wever suffered severe head injuries and remains on life support at John Hunter Hospital, while Mr Whitey was discharged on Sunday with a broken femur. </p>

<p>A family friend said Mr Whitey was 'praying for a miracle' by her bedside.</p>

<p>'Still fighting to survive to go home to her three babies,' Angie Smalley wrote on social media.</p>

<p>Ms Wever (pictured) suffered severe head injuries following the crash</p>

<p>Ms Smalley has launched a GoFundMe page to help support the family.</p>

<p>'Tamika is fighting for her life. This loving, kind, fun soul is in critical condition with injuries that horrendous I have been told not to expect to recognise my gorgeous friend's face when I go to see her,' Ms Smalley wrote.</p>

<p>'She is a young amazing mum, always putting her babies first, always smiling, she is funny with an absolute gentle soul that did not deserve this. </p>

<p>'Please, even if you can spare $1 to help me help this family not have the financial burden along with so many others at this difficult time...they will appreciate your kindness.' </p>

<p>The alleged 17-year-old driver of the Holden was on a good behaviour bond when he allegedly crashed into the maxi taxi and had never held a licence, The Daily Telegraph reported. </p>

<p>Just two months ago on August 2, he was disqualified from driving, fined $350 and put on a 12-month good behaviour bond after crashing a stolen car while drunk.   </p>

<p>Ms Wever's friend is asking for donations to help support the family during this 'difficult time' (pictured with fiancé Dylan Whitey and two of their sons)</p>

<p>Before the most recent incident, police had been following the Holden 'due to the manner of driving'.</p>

<p>Moments later the teenage boy allegedly ran through a red light and slammed into the taxi causing it to flip onto its side.</p>

<p>Officers are also investigating if some of the driver's passengers were attempting to escape the scene despite being injured following the crash. </p>

<p>The alleged teenage driver was charged with a total of 15 offences including three counts of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm – drive manner dangerous, eight counts of cause bodily harm by misconduct in charge of a motor vehicle and disqualified driving. </p>

<p>He was refused bail on Sunday and once again on Monday. He is due to reappear in court on October 26. </p>
