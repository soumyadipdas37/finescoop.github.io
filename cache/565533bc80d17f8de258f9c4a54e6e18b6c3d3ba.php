<p>Less than impressed: Chris didn't appear to be too fazed with the request and politely obliged</p>

<p>She whisked her hair up into a stylish up-do, and appeared to be wearing minimal make-up to enhance her natural beauty.</p>

<p>Thor actor Chris, meanwhile, opted for a casual grey T-shirt and a pair of shorts.</p>

<p>He's not going anywhere! Recently, Chris spoke out about the rumours that he would no longer be starring as Marvel superhero Thor following the news that Natalie Portman is set to wield the mythical hammer in the next Thor film, set for release in 2022</p>

<p>Gorgeous: Elsa looked stunning in her long skirt and jumper combo, and wore minimal make-up to emphasise her pretty features, while Chris opted for a more casual look</p>

<p>Excitement: Chris said he expected the film's script would be a huge hit with fans while speaking with the Philadelphia Inquirer in April this year</p>

<p>Speaking to Poland's Elle Man this month, Chris confirmed he won't be retiring his famous character after Thor: Love and Thunder.</p>

<p>'Are you crazy?! I'm not going into any retirement period,' he said.</p>

<p>'Thor is far too young for that. He's only 1,500 years old. It's definitely not a film that I say goodbye to this brand. At least I hope so.'</p>

<p>Chris said he expected the film's script would be a huge hit with fans while speaking with the Philadelphia Inquirer in April this year.</p>

<p>Sweet: The pair looked loved-up on their brief outing</p>

<p>Thrilled: Speaking about his return to Thor, Chris recently said 'It's one of the best scripts I've read in years'</p>

<p>'It's one of the best scripts I've read in years,' he told the publication.</p>

<p>'It's [director] Taika [Waititi] at his most extreme, and at his best. If the version I read is the one we get running with, it's going to be pretty insane.'</p>

<p>The movie, the fourth in the action franchise, reunites Hemsworth with Tessa Thompson and Natalie Portman, and also features Christian Bale.</p>

<p>Chic: Elsa often wears floaty boho ensembles, and it was no different for her breakfast date on Wednesday </p>
