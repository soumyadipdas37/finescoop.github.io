<p>The most intriguing part of this property is the secret passageway which forms part of the coastal town’s underground medieval passages.</p>

<p>The one leading from the garden of this five-storey townhouse to the boathouse is believed to have been the final part of 14-year-old Henry Tudor’s escape route alongside his uncle Jasper Tudor.</p>

<p>The pair were trying to escape the Yorkist siege of Pembroke Castle. They used it to reach the harbour to get to the relative safety of Brittany, France in 1471.</p>

<p>But it wasn't easy. Despite owning a property in the nearby coastal town of Tenby, Jasper knew the community could be full of York’s spies.</p>

<p>So he enlisted the help of Mayor of Tenby, Thomas White, who gave them refuge in the cellar of his home and that's when the duo planned their escape.</p>

<p>They made their way to the harbour through the secret tunnels and left for France. It was where Henry VII came of age and Jasper helped him plan their return  </p>

<p>The same tunnels were used in 1485 for Henry’s return. The homecoming ended with victory at the Battle of Bosworth where Henry overpowered and defeated King Richard III and was crowned King Henry VII.</p>

<p>According to historians, it’s possible the Tudors may never have come to power if it wasn’t for these secret passageways.</p>
