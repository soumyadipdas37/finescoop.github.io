<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian stuck in mandatory hotel quarantine has shared footage of guests racing around the lobby during their 30-minute fresh air break. </p>

<p>The person took the video on September 21 to show how desperate travellers staying at the Brisbane hotel are to get out of their rooms. </p>

<p>They described atmosphere in the lobby, where guests raced around the perimeter in face masks, as 'almost cult-like'. </p>

<p>The returned passengers (pictured) are all seen wearing face masks and walking around exercising in the hotel's lobby 'almost cult like'</p>

<p>'As part of our mandatory 14 day hotel quarantine, we're allowed downstairs in the hotel lobby for 30 minutes of fresh air,' the individual told Newsflare.</p>

<p>The returned travellers are all seen with their faces covered and walking in a circle in single file. </p>

<p>'An interesting perspective of harsh Australian lockdown measures,' they said.</p>

<p>To curb the spread of the deadly COVID-19, Australians returning from overseas must undertake 14-days of hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>NSW, QLD and WA will increase their traveller intake as the federal government changes the cap on how many Australians can return home.</p>

<p>Returned passengers at a Brisbane hotel were permitted only 30 minutes of free time</p>

<p>Australia recorded 21 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, 15 of them in Victoria and the six in NSW all from hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>There were also a further five deaths recorded from Victoria  taking the state's death toll to 771 and the national figure to 859. </p>

<p>The fatalities include two women in their 80s, a woman in her 100s, a man in his 70s and a man in his 90s, and all are linked to aged care </p>

<p>The state's 14-day rolling case average continues to decrease lower at 29.4 for Melbourne and 1.1 for regional Victoria.</p>

<p>Melbourne is on the verge of easing restrictions following weeks of strict Stage Four restrictions which only allowed residents to leave their homes for four permitted reasons. </p>
