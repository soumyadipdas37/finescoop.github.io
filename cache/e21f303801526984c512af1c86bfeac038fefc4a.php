<p>'Stop s**t-shaming!' Love Island Australia star Phoebe Thompson has defended women using OnlyFans as a means to generate income</p>

<p>OnlyFans is a subscription-based website where followers can view everything from conservative photos to sexually explicit videos.</p>

<p>While Phoebe isn't using OnlyFans herself, three of her previous Love Island castmates - Shelby Bilby, Edyn Mackney and Vanessa Sierra - are seeing incredible success on the platform.</p>

<p>And Phoebe made it clear that she was in full support of their decisions to make money on OnlyFans.</p>

<p>Phoebe began her lengthy Instagram message by saying: ' Shout out to all the women doing OF making bank!!!! The s**t shaming and judgement you receive is mostly from insecure men and women with internalised misogyny.</p>

<p>She added: 'TRUTH is that people don’t like to see women capitalising of their sexuality/ body!! </p>

<p>'The anger is not in nudity but in women taking back the power to make choices about their own bodies whilst independently using a platform to earn more money than you....</p>

<p>'Just a reminder that different women feel empowered by different things!!! Whether you’re working a pole, wearing scrubs, raising children, dominating a court room, a CEO or a h**, you all bad a** hustlers,' she ended. </p>
