<p>'I was like, wait, somebody would pay like 60 grand for me to go and spend, like, three days with them?</p>

<p>'And they keep saying, "OK, well, not 40 grand then, we'll do 50 grand for three nights." And I'm [thinking], oh my gosh. </p>

<p>'Imagine if I [said] yes. And then they were like, "no, actually this is somebody and it went out to the press or something - Amber's got a sugar daddy."'</p>
