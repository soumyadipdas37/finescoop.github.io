<p>Mark Sheriff, a former lighthouse keeper, snapped the koala on the side of Smoky Cape Lighthouse, on the NSW Mid North Coast, after returning from a late night swim.  </p>

<p>He said he was used to seeing people attempting to sneak into the lighthouse but never a koala.</p>

<p>Former lighthouse keeper, Mark Sheriff (pictured) was returning from a late night swim when he spotted the koala on the side of Smoky Cape Lighthouse</p>

<p>'I looked up and he's gone all the way up the top,' Mr Sheriff told ABC.</p>

<p>Mr Sheriff quickly rushed upstairs to the lantern room to find the marsupial trying to climb the walls. </p>

<p>'I just grabbed him and we were both sort of freaked out, we just needed to calm down, find a quiet spot.' </p>

<p>The koala, who Mr Sheriff named Pat after his mother, eventually calmed down after his late-night adventure.</p>

<p>Mr Sheriff brought the koala safely back to the ground before releasing him in nearby bushland. </p>

<p>'As soon as I got near the big trees, he just grunted and I could feel his ball of energy and I just let him go. That was it,' he said. </p>

<p>Mr Sheriff recalled Pat's 'really lovely smell' and said it was 'cool' that koalas have their own smell just like horses. </p>
