<p>Gareth Bale is back on the training pitch after stepping up his recovery from a knee injury</p>

<p>The forward is looking to get fit to make his Tottenham debut after the international break</p>

<p>Bale watched Spurs' Carabao Cup victory over Chelsea from the stands on Tuesday and Mourinho confirmed that he would miss the clash with Manchester United on Sunday.</p>

<p>However, he is hopeful the forward will be available to face West Ham on October 17.  </p>

<p>'He is working very hard, very committed, very professional, very happy but not yet ready.</p>

<p>Bale will miss the game at Manchester United but could be fit to face West Ham on October 17</p>

<p>The Welshman looked happy to be back on the grass and tweeted that he is working hard </p>

<p>'I believe the two weeks of internationals can be important weeks for his last phase of recovering and fitness problem.</p>

<p>'Hopefully to play when we're back to the weekend after national teams. Let's see if it's possible to arrive there.'</p>

<p>Bale will also miss Wales' friendly against England next Thursday as well as the Nations League tie with the Republic of Ireland.</p>

<p>But Ryan Giggs believes the forward will be even better for his national side after ending his nightmare spell at Real Madrid to re-join Tottenham on loan.</p>

<p>Working hard 💪🏼 <?php echo e('@'); ?>SpursOfficial pic.twitter.com/Mc3MGKnCBY</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter what quality and experience he possesses, it's always better when you are playing, especially in the international arena when you have two games in a short space of time. </p>

<p>'He's at a club he knows well with a very good manager and he's said himself it's like going back home.</p>

<p>'He will play more regularly than he did at Madrid. It's a good move for Gareth, it's good for Spurs and good for the Premier League in general, to have someone like that who we can watch every week.'</p>
