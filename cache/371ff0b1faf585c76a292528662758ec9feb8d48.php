<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Southgate issued a passionate rallying cry to his squad as he praised his players for emerging as England's lockdown heroes.</p>

<p>The national team boss had not seen his players for 10 months prior to the current international break because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>And Southgate took the opportunity on Monday night, just hours after his players reported for duty, to address them during a welcome briefing at the national football centre in Burton.</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate has reunited with his England squad after 10 months away from each other</p>

<p>England face Iceland away on Saturday before travelling to Denmark three days later</p>

<p>The England manager spoke of the challenges that have confronted football and society during the health crisis that has so far resulted in over 41,000 deaths in the UK alone.</p>

<p>But in acknowledging the difficulties that have faced the UK, he also lauded his players for the roles they played in lifting the nation's spirits.</p>

<p>Marcus Rashford and Jordan Henderson — who are both missing from the current squad through injury — have been at the forefront of successful social initiatives during the lockdown period. </p>

<p>Rashford lobbied the Government to provide school dinners for some of the UK's poorer families, and Henderson led the Players Together initiative that raised millions of pounds for the NHS during the height of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling's work in fighting for racial equality amid the powerful Black Lives Matter movement also captured the nation's heart.</p>

<p>The FA's work in trying to increase diversity within the game will take on significant prominence over the next few weeks as they look to launch their new Diversity Code during the October international break.</p>

<p>Southgate has been immensely proud of his players away from football during lockdown and acknowledged their efforts on Monday night.</p>

<p>But he stressed the importance of re-focusing for a crucial 10-month period ahead of next summer's postponed European Championship, a tournament in which England will be one of the favourites.</p>

<p>There is uncertainty, however, over the availability of Kieran Trippier next summer as he awaits news on his FA charge of breaching betting regulations.</p>

<p>The Atletico Madrid right back was charged in May — but no timescale has been placed on the case and there are concerns that should the issue drag into next year and Trippier is banned then he could be unavailable for the Euros, which begin in June.</p>

<p>Ahead of Saturday's clash against Iceland, Southgate has no qualms about selecting Sterling and Joe Gomez in his team following their fall-out at St George's Park in November and both are likely to play some part in the forthcoming Nations League matches.</p>
