<p>Samara recently told The Daily Telegraph channelling her emotions into characters helps alleviate her anxiety disorder.</p>

<p>Samara's parents first pushed her towards drama classes as a child, hoping she'd come out of her shell, but she still feels 'terribly awkward' in everyday life. </p>

<p>'Oh, I am still terribly awkward. I have general anxiety disorder, so that's never really going to go away,' she said.</p>

<p>'But I am very grateful that I have an outlet for that, which is my job, so I can use these emotions. Sometimes it's a way to escape that, and it's very helpful for me.</p>

<p>'So that nervous, shy child I think is always there, but I have developed tools and methods to cope with it.'</p>

<p>Therapeutic: This comes after Samara recently told The Daily Telegraph that channelling her emotions into characters helps alleviate her anxiety disorder</p>
