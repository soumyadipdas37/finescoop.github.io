<p>A pilot onboard a plane flying from Bangkok to Novosibirsk in western Siberia died from a heart attack, transportation prosecutors said Friday.</p>

<p>Sergei Golev, 44, suffered the attack in the cockpit and died despite all attempts at resuscitation - even a cardiologist, who was among passengers on the flight, failed to revive him.</p>

<p>Fortunately the 239 passengers onboard the UTair Boeing 757 landed safely in Novosibirsk despite Golev's death.</p>

<p>Death in the air: Pilto Sergei Golev passed away onboard a UTair Boeing 757 from Bangkok to Novosibirsk</p>

<p>The captain attempted an emergency landing in the Chinese city of Chengdu, but abandoned it because Golev died before the jet touched down.</p>

<p>Senior investigator Anastasia Utochkina told Life News: 'The co-pilot died at 12.25am, Novosibirsk Time (5.25pm GMT), three hours after takeoff.</p>

<p>'The captain made a decision to descend, while the crew called over the tannoy for a female physician who happened to be among the passengers.</p>

<p>'However, her attempts to revive the man, who was lying on the cockpit floor, failed.'</p>

<p>Safe landing: 239 passengers were taken to the final destination of Novosibirisk airport despite Golev's death</p>

<p>Airport officials insist that the co-pilot was merely traveling as a passenger and in no way and at no point was in control of the aircraft.</p>

<p>Irina Levit, a press officer at Novosibirsk airport: 'The deceased pilot was traveling as an ordinary passenger.</p>

<p>'The aircraft belongs to UTair airline, where Sergey Golev was employed. There was no threat to passengers.'</p>

<p>Golev was a crew member – a reserve pilot, tasked, ironically, with replacing a crew member in case they fall ill.</p>

<p>The Investigation Department of Russia’s transport authority has launched an inquiry into the case in an effort to uncover the cause of the incident.</p>
