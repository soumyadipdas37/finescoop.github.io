<p>'I fall in love with a person, not the gender': The Bachelorette star Angie Kent revealed on the Kyle and Jackie O Show on Wednesday that she's PANSEXUAL, but admitted she's never been with a woman</p>

<p>'Have you ever been with a woman?' shock jock Kyle Sandilands asked Angie. </p>

<p>She added that she's kissed women before, and joked it's because she hails from the Sunshine Coast.</p>

<p>'Yeah of course I have, it's the thing to do back on the Sunshine Coast. There's nothing else to do. I've always said since I was younger, I fall in love with a soul rather than a gender.'</p>

<p>Jackie O then asked Angie if she's pansexual, when Angie confirmed she is. </p>

<p>A pansexual person is attracted to someone or falls in love with them regardless of their biological sex or gender identity. </p>

<p>'There you go, I've got a label!' Jackie O then asked Angie if she's pansexual, when Angie confirmed she is</p>

<p>'There you go, I've got a label. I think it comes down to the chemistry,' she said.</p>

<p>The blonde reality star also spoke about her and Carlin's split, saying that they broke up because their 'values didn't align.' </p>

<p>'I'm more spiritual, carefree and wild, whereas he's a Christian boy. We're just different,' Angie said. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Carlin revealed his relationship with Angie began to fall apart after he discovered she was texting runner-up Timm Hanly.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old personal trainer told the How to Life podcast that the pair's bond made him feel insecure, even though he pretended to be okay with it at first.</p>

<p>'She really cared for Tim. They were kind of messaging a little bit afterwards. I was trying to play it cool, like "it's fine, it's all good,"' Carlin began.</p>

<p>Despite telling Angie he didn't mind her staying in contact with Timm, Carlin's self-confidence plummeted when he discovered their friendly texts.</p>

<p>'I was trying to be nice and I was trying to do the right thing,' he said.</p>

<p>'And then more and more, her and Timm messaging each other, it just started to really eat me away.' </p>
