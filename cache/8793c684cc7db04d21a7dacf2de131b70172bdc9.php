<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jane Fonda called legendary heartthrob Marlon Brando 'disappointing' as she reflected on her early days in Hollywood and her brand new book in a new profile for the New York Times.</p>

<p>Fonda, 82, dished dirt during a quick round of 'Confirm or Deny' questions, where she told reporter Maureen Dowd she wasn't exactly charmed by the Wild One talent, who was her co-star in the 1966 drama The Chase.</p>

<p>While she said her experience with Brando was lackluster, the actress/activist admitted she wishes she got closer to another star, telling the NYT she regrets never hooking up with late crooner Marvin Gaye.'</p>

<p>Vintage gossip: Jane Fonda, 82, dished about her early days in Hollywood during some quickfire questions in an in-depth New York Time profile of the star. There, she admitted Marlon Brando was 'disappointing' to her but said she wishes she slept with Marvin Gaye </p>

<p>Asked for her take on Brando, Fonda simply said: 'Disappointing...' but she did give him credit for being 'a great actor.' </p>

<p>One of Dowd's cheekier questions asked Fonda whether her 'greatest regret is that you never had sex with Che Guevara.'</p>

<p>But it wasn't the Cuban revolutionary who left a lasting impression. </p>

<p>'No, I don't think about him,' Jane said. 'Who I do think about, and what is a great regret is Marvin Gaye. He wanted to and I didn't. I was married to Tom [Hayden].'</p>

<p>Fonda was wed to the left-wing activist/politician for 17 years, wed in 1973. Hayden passed away in 2016. They two shared 47-year-old son Troy Garity. </p>

<p>Co-stars: Asked for her take on Brando, Fonda simply said: 'Disappointing...' but she did give him credit for being 'a great actor.' The pair worked on 1966's The Chase together</p>

<p>Regrets, I have a few: Fonda said she regrets never getting it on with Sexual Healing singer Marvin Gaye, above 1974. 'He wanted to and I didn't,' she explained, adding 'I was married to Tom [Hayden]'</p>

<p>Jane explained how she actually met the Let's Get It On singer while recruiting performers to do benefit concerts for her late ex. </p>

<p>'I was meeting a lot of performers to try to do concerts for Tom and the woman who was helping me do that introduced me to Marvin Gaye,' she said.</p>

<p>Tickled at the thought of a Fonda/Gaye fling, Dowd joked: 'Please tell me his pickup line included the words 'sexual healing.''</p>

<p>Jane admitted while that would have been nice, she turned down his offer.</p>

<p>'I needed some but he didn't say that, no,' Fonda went on. 'But then I read, apparently he had my picture on his refrigerator. I didn't find that out until later, after he was dead.'</p>

<p>Dynamic duo: Fonda was wed to left-wing activist/politician Tom Hayden for 17 years, wed in 1973. Hayden passed away in 2016. They two shared 47-year-old son Troy Garity. They're seen in 1979 above</p>

<p>Gaye died in 1984 after being shot  by his father at their LA home.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Brando and Gaye are rumored to have had slept together. </p>

<p>In 2018 Quincy Jones told Vulture about Marlon's voracious appetite for sex, dishing: 'Brando would fuck anything. Anything!He'd fuck a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye.'</p>

<p>Gaye's son denied the rumors, saying: 'We didn't really think too much about it because we know the facts. My dad was a ladies man. Everybody loved my dad but my dad didn't have anything against homosexuals. He was about love. I think he would have laughed it off personally.'</p>

<p>Independent woman: Back in 2018 Fonda told People she spent decades 'defined by the men in [her] life,' until becoming single in her 60s, telling them 'It took me getting into my sixties, and then I began to become who I was supposed to be all along'</p>

<p>Back in 2018 Fonda told People she spent decades 'defined by the men in [her] life,' until becoming single in her 60s. </p>

<p>'Up until my sixties, I was to an extent, defined by the men in my life. I was brought up to please,' she said. </p>

<p>'I wanted my father to love me so I would turn myself into a pretzel to be what he wanted me to be, not necessarily what I already was.' </p>

<p>'It took me getting into my sixties, and then I began to become who I was supposed to be all along.'</p>
