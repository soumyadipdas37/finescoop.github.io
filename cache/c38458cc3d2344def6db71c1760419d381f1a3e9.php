<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>NCAA athletes will not be required to practice or play on November 3 to allow them to participate on Election Day.  </p>

<p>The NCAA's Division I Council's voted Wednesday to prohibit top-level colleges from organizing athletic activities on the first Tuesday of November, when voting traditionally takes place in the United States.  </p>

<p>The legislation was proposed by the Division I Student-Athlete Advisory Committee, and will begin this year. According to the NCAA, this is the first SAAC-proposed legislation since the group was given voting rights at every level of the organization.</p>

<p>Many universities were already planning to give student athletes the day off on November 3, including USC, Oregon, Gonzaga, and Georgia Tech, according to ESPN.</p>

<p>NCAA President Mark Emmert (pictured) and the Board of Governors 'recognize the important role social engagement has on driving positive societal change,' according to a statement</p>

<p>'The Council unanimously supports this important piece of legislation,' Division I Council chairperson M. Grace Calhoun, the University of Pennsylvania athletic director, said in a statement. 'Coming from Division I SAAC, we know it represents the voice of student-athletes across the country who continue to express a desire to increase their civic engagement at local, state and federal levels. We look forward to seeing student-athletes use this opportunity as a way to create positive change.'</p>

<p>Since June, the NCAA encouraged its member schools to promote voting registration in the wake of George Floyd's killing at the hands of Minneapolis police on May 25.</p>

<p>'President Mark Emmert and the NCAA Board of Governors recognize the important role social engagement has on driving positive societal change,' the NCAA statement said. 'The recent demonstrations following the tragic killing of George Floyd showed the world the power of protest and student-athletes across the country were at the center of that movement.</p>

<p>'We commend NCAA student-athletes who recognized the need for change and took action though safe and peaceful protest. We encourage students to continue to make their voices heard on these important issues, engage in community activism and exercise their Constitutional rights.'</p>

<p>Despite the NCAA's efforts, the University of Georgia on Wednesday announced that on-campus voting has been cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic. Instead, the school suggested students vote in downtown Athens, Georgia, and offered to 'provide a shuttle service' for those who need it.</p>

<p>The announcement was rebuked by many on social media, who seized upon the fact that the University of Georgia will permit at least 18,000 fans to attend the football team's home opener on October 3.</p>

<p>'Translation: The election is tight, so [Georgia Governor Brian Kemp] is demanding we join in on the voter suppression, even if it means unnecessarily killing people on our campus and in Athens,' New York Times bestselling author Kurt Eichenwald wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>'Wow,' tweeted The Nation's Dave Zirin, '<?php echo e('@'); ?>UGA doing its part for the new Jim Crow.'</p>

<p>'You don't have a football game scheduled for the stadium on Tuesday, November 3rd, so it's available to be a big, safe voting site,' added one Twitter user. 'Thanks for suggesting this!'</p>

<p>The school addressed those concerns in its own statement, referring to its social distancing plans and reminding critics that voting would take place inside, whereas the football game is played outdoors at Sanford Stadium.</p>

<p>'Those comparing this matter to a football game should be able to recognize that football games will be played outdoors but we will still require social distancing by substantially reducing capacity in the stadium,' read the school statement. 'We have eliminated tailgating as well due to a desire to keep the campus as safe as possible and limit visitors during the pandemic.'</p>

<p>As recently as last week, the school reported 1,400 new cases of COVID-19 over the previous seven days. </p>

<p>The numbers, reported Wednesday, push the 39,000-student university close to 2,600 total infections in the past four weeks, according to the school's data. Although Georgia College &amp; State University still has recorded a larger share of infections among its campus community since August 1, UGA's outbreak is now the fastest growing among universities in the state that are publicly reporting numbers.</p>

<p>The surge is clearly reflected in the figures for the broader Athens-Clarke County community. Clarke County is 23rd among U.S. counties for the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, according to figures kept by The Associated Press, although the university says some tests may come from students and employees elsewhere.</p>

<p>And a rising positivity rate suggests things could be getting worse, with 8% of surveillance tests conducted to keep an eye on the spread of the virus coming back positive last week, compared to 5 percent the week before.</p>
