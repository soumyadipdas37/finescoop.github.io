<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pregnancy and the anticipation of a new addition to your family is exciting, but it can be an uncomfortable time for mums-to-be too.</p>

<p>Whether you're having trouble sleeping or you're after something to ease your back while you're sitting on the sofa, the Koala Babycare Koala Hugs Nursing V Pillow could be the perfect solution.</p>

<p>Not only does the pillow help to reduce pain, make you more comfortable, and ultimately allow you to get a better night's sleep, but it can be used as a bumper or cot reducer and nursing pillow too.</p>

<p>Now on sale with 35 per cent off, the multi-functional Koala Babycare Koala Hugs Nursing V Pillow is a must-have for mums-to-be </p>

<p>The highly-rated V pregnancy pillow (also known as maternity pillow or body pillow) has received a near-perfect average star rating of 4.7 out of 5 from over 2,200 reviews. In fact, 80 per cent of shoppers awarded the pillow a full five stars.</p>

<p>A lot of the glowing reviews highlight the pillow's positive effects on the user's aches and pains. And unlike other inexpensive options, mums-to-be praise the pillow for the support it provides to the hips, back, neck and head. Plus, now with 35 per cent off, it's a cheap and cheerful option costing just £20.70.</p>

<p>'What's an absolute dream this pillow is!' wrote one Amazon shopper in their review. 'It comes vacuum packed, and initially, I wasn't sure on how much it would fill out, but it's lovely and firm (but still soft enough to be comfortable).</p>

<p>'The length of it means you can really get it into a position to relieve any aches and pains (mostly hip pain for me) and it still supports your bump beautifully. I can't wait to use it for all of its other uses once baby is here!'</p>

<p>Another delighted shopper raved: 'I was feeling extremely uncomfortable by the time I was six months pregnant and literally tried about five pregnancy pillows before finding the perfect one.</p>

<p>'Others were just too big and took up the who bed much to my partner dismay, and we both had sleepless less nights because of lack of room or being too hot. And this is before the baby's arrival!'</p>

<p>The Koala Babycare V maternity pillow can be used as a breastfeeding pillow</p>

<p>'A must-have for mums-to-be,' commented another shopper. 'So happy that I purchased this item. After a few nights using this pillow, the hip pain I have been getting for months at night has eased to almost none. I have much more comfortable nights now. Would definitely recommend to other pregnant ladies.'</p>

<p>The KHugs pregnancy pillow's design means it can cover the needs of pregnancy and the months after your baby is born. It can be used both as a nursing pillow and as a bumper or cot reducer.</p>

<p>The polka dot pillow is available in six colourways. The brand's KHugs Plus design, which costs £40.95, comes with a removable mini-pillow, that can be used in different positions to ensure maximum comfort.</p>
