<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Aston Villa striker Mbwana Samatta is in Turkey to negotiate a proposed move to Fenerbahce.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old only joined in January for £8.5million from Genk but has failed to have the desired impact as Villa struggled and flirted with relegation. He has scored twice in 16 appearances.</p>

<p>Manager Dean Smith has brought in Ollie Watkins from Brentford for a club-record £28m and Lyon winger Bertrand Traore for £19m so has been looking to offset that spending with the sale of Samatta.</p>

<p>Mbwana Samatta has not featured at all this season and last scored in the Carabao Cup final</p>

<p>Aston Villa have bolstered their attacking options with the purchases of Bertrand Traore (left) for around £17m and Ollie Watkins for a club-record £28m</p>

<p>The Tanzania international was offered to West Brom earlier this month, but they turned down the chance and he is now in Turkey discussing a move to Fenerbahce, who finished seventh last season.</p>

<p>The deal is likely to be an initial loan, with Samatta talking to club staff and having a look around on Thursday before committing to a contract.</p>

<p>Villa are still looking to add players on loan themselves with Chelsea's Ross Barkley and Ruben Loftus-Cheek among those they are keen on.</p>

<p>Loftus-Cheek was left out of Chelsea's squad to face Barnsley on Wednesday, but talks with Villa are at a very early stage with other clubs also interested if he is allowed to leave.</p>

<p>Loftus-Cheek started in Chelsea's 3-1 win against Brighton on the opening weekend of the season, but lasted just an hour.</p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek ruptured his Achilles tendon in May 2019 and returned after lockdown</p>
