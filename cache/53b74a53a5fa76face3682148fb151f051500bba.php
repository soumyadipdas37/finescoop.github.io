<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Finding tights that are comfortable, stay up, and are made to last seems like an endless pursuit. But hundreds of Amazon shoppers seem to have found a solution to these common problems with the Manzi 70 Denier Women's Tights.  </p>

<p>Reviewers describe the tights as 'durable, firm and completely opaque' with a 'buttery texture'. </p>

<p>Not only are they comfortable and soft to touch, but the Manzi tights are only £12.99 for a pack of two or £15.99 for a pack of three. If you're heading back to the office, it might be wise to stock up. </p>

<p>The Manzi 70 Denier Women's Tights have been designed with a control top meaning that you get added shapewear with every pair</p>

<p>There's nothing worse then investing in a pair of 'high-quality' tights for them only to rip on the first wear. While £12.99 for two pairs of tights isn't the cheapest price out there, we believe it's worth spending a little more to ensure your tights last longer. </p>

<p>And Amazon reviewers seem to agree. One wrote: 'These are fantastic tights for a very good price. They fit perfectly are a lovely texture and look ( not too shiny ) but soft and opaque and the top has good control without being uncomfortable. </p>

<p>'They also do not ladder as all of my other tights seem to do. I've given up buying any other tights as these are the best I have found.'</p>

<p>Denier 40 and higher is considered opaque, so with a rating of 70 denier the Manzi tights are definitely on the thicker end. If you're looking for sheer tights, this might not be the best set for you. </p>

<p>However, as a general rule opaque tights are thicker so if you're looking for a more durable pair of tights that are less prone to laddering, these are a great option. </p>

<p>The tights have also been designed with a control top meaning that you get added shapewear with every pair. The control section creates a slimming silhouette as it smooths out the areas on the hips, tummy and upper thighs. </p>

<p>This has been a big hit with shoppers, with one raving: 'Tights are durable, firm and completely opaque. Perfect fit, long enough, the bit around belly generous in size, and holds everything in - no need for spandex!'</p>

<p>The opaque tights have been designed with a control top to smooth the hips, tummy and upper thighs for a flattering silhouette </p>

<p>Shoppers have also reported that the Manzi tights hold their shape well, noting that they are comfortable enough to wear all day without falling down. </p>

<p>'Love these tights,' one shopper wrote. 'They are so soft on the skin and fit very well. The comfiest tights I have ever had and they don't pinch the skin at all. So comfortable to wear all day with a buttery texture.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, writing: 'OMG! These tights are amazing. Great length, feel so smooth and don't fall down. I am a size 18 and ordered XL. </p>

<p>'They are perfect. I like tights that go over the belly to give you that smooth line. These do just that. I'm so happy that I'm going to order some more.' </p>
