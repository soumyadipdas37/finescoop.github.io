<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There weren't many cool heads as Kieran Gibbs received a red card in Everton's thrashing of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday afternoon. </p>

<p>Gibbs was sent off after catching James Rodriguez with a raised arm, and then had an angry exchange of words with Seamus Coleman as he was walking off the pitch.</p>

<p>'I'll f****** do it again,' said Gibbs, walking past a group of Everton players, and the Toffees captain took exception.  </p>

<p>Kieran Gibbs received a red card for violent conduct in West Brom's defeat to Everton</p>

<p>'No you won't do it again,' Coleman retorted. 'Who are you talking to, you'll do it again? Hard man... f****** hard man.'</p>

<p>It all started when there was controversy as Rodriguez gave Gibbs a shove by the touchline with the Albion defender reacting by catching him in the cheek with a raised arm.</p>

<p>Rodriguez milked it with a roll and clutch of the face and Gibbs was dismissed.</p>

<p>As he left the pitch, Gibbs had a heated exchange with Everton captain Seamus Coleman</p>

<p>Gibbs had received a shove from James Rodriguez, and responded by raising his arm</p>

<p>Bilic argued with Dean when they walked off and was given a red card himself, but later admitted his player 'had given the referee no choice' and said Gibbs would have been better falling to the ground himself. </p>

<p>Everton ended up winning the game 5-2, leaving the Baggies rooted to the bottom of the table having conceded eight goals in their first two games back in the Premier League. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Everton spent the night at the top of the table, but have now been leapfrogged by Leicester City after their own big win on Sunday. </p>
