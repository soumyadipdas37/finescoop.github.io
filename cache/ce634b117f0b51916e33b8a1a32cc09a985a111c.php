<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Una and Sam for comment. </p>

<p>And Una's ex Ben has since found love again after he tied the knot with his new wife Jackie Belanoff Smith in August 2019 and on the same day his divorce from Una was granted.</p>

<p>Admitting the move wasn't 'very respectful', the rugby player said recently: 'I hold my hands up and say, it was wrong. </p>

<p>'My final decree didn't even come through until the morning of us getting married. </p>
