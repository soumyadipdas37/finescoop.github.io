<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A cheeky parrot brought hilarity to an Australian motorway by checking out its reflection in a surveillance camera. </p>

<p>The curious corella bird started pecking on the camera lens on a gantry above the highway in Western Australia last week.   </p>

<p>It hogged the limelight from passing cars and would-be traffic offenders as it tried to peek inside the lens of the camera, before several other corellas joined their friend and flew away.</p>

<p>The bird, a type of cockatoo, has been nicknamed 'Ralph' after it amazed traffic camera operators on Perth's Kwinana Freeway. </p>

<p>Life on the road: This curious parrot obstructed a traffic camera on an Australian motorway after perching itself on a gantry </p>

<p>Approach: The traffic camera had the perfect view as the cockatoo spread its wings and landed on the gantry above the Kwinana Freeway </p>

<p>Three types of corella - the little corella, the long-billed corella and the western corella - are native to Australia.  </p>

<p>All of them have short crests, patches of blue-grey skin around the eye, brown eyes and pale yellow under the wings and tail, according to the Western Australian Museum.  </p>

<p>Little corellas are known to entertain themselves by sliding down roofs, dropping off the edge and then flying back to the top again. </p>

<p>Australia also has a population of sulphur-crested cockatoos with yellow crests and a larger wingspan, which are also found in New Guinea and nearby islands. </p>

<p>There are thought to be around 800 bird species in Australia, of which nearly half are endemic because of the continent's long isolation from the rest of the world.  </p>

<p>Staring straight ahead: The parrot looked at its reflection in the camera lens as cars drove past far below </p>

<p>Closer view: The curious corella bird leaned in to get a better look and tried to peck at the lens of the surveillance camera </p>

<p>Eye to eye: The bird obstructed the view of cars and would-be traffic offenders as it gazed curiously at the camera </p>

<p>Entertainment: The bird, a type of cockatoo, has been nicknamed 'Ralph' after it amazed traffic camera operators on the Kwinana Freeway</p>
