<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Steven Gerrard, Tyson Fury and a host of other star names from the world of sport have sent messages of support to a teenaged Celtic fan fighting brain cancer. </p>

<p>Daniel Caplan, 17 from Glasgow, has been diagnosed with a brain tumour known as DMG (diffuse midline glioma, grade 4), which is currently incurable. </p>

<p>However, via a Glasgow based neurological research charity called Funding Neuro, there may be opportunities for treatment trials in the future and as such, a fundraising page has been set up and a charity match took place at Hamilton's Foundation of Youth stadium on Saturday. </p>

<p>Daniel Caplan, a 17-year-old Celtic fan from Glasgow, has been diagnosed with brain cancer</p>

<p>Rangers manager Steven Gerrard sent a message of support to the young Celtic supporter</p>

<p>World heavyweight champion Tyson Fury was amongst a number of stars to send their support</p>

<p>Virtual streaming tickets for the event cost £5 and all proceeds went to charity, with over 900 tuning in.  </p>

<p>As well as Rangers boss Gerrard and world heavyweight champion Fury, Celtic captain Scott Brown, manager Neil Lennon, former defender Kieran Tierney and ex-Scotland international Graeme Souness also sent their heartfelt messages of support to Daniel. </p>

<p>Gerrard, in a short video where he announced Angel Revive (of which Gerrard is an ambassador) would provide the water for the charity game at the weekend, sent a strong message of support to the youngster. </p>

<p>'I want to give a special mention to Daniel. I know you have had a tough time of late and you have spent some time in hospital so I want to send you some love and support,' Gerrard said. </p>

<p>'I hope you have a good day. I also want to say how proud I am that Angel Revive are going to sponsor the event and provide all the water, which makes me feel really good. </p>

<p>'Thirdly, I hope the match got well and you all have a fantastic evening at the event. All the best.'</p>

<p>Arsenal defender Tierney said: 'Just like to say, you are in my thoughts and in my prayers.</p>

<p>Former Celtic defender Kieran Tierney said that Daniel was in his 'thoughts and prayers'</p>

<p>Ex-Scotland international and Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness also sent his support</p>

<p>'I hope you are staying strong and positive always. Keep up the good fight. The charity match going ahead this week is for a great cause and I hope everyone taking part has a great day.'</p>

<p>Celtic legend Frank McAvennie coached one of the sides during Saturday's match, and also spoke at a fundraising dinner afterwards alongside Rangers hero Willie Henderson. </p>

<p>Daniel's father, Brian, organised the match with the help of friends and family and explained how the idea came to fruition. </p>

<p>Celtic captain Scott Brown (left) and manager Neil Lennon (right) also sent their support</p>

<p>'We brought the idea from the kids talking about a football game into the masterplan that was executed on Saturday in terms of the game going on, the referee and organisation and strips. It was a proper game of football,' Brian said. </p>

<p>'It was on pay-per-view and I think around 900 logged in to it and paid the £5 for it so that was more money for charity which was great. It was all in aid of finding a solution for my boy Daniel who was diagnosed with this condition which is very challenging.</p>

<p>The charity match at Hamilton's Foundation of Youth stadium on Saturday was a great success</p>

<p>'I played in it and lasted 13 minutes before I hobbled off with a hamstring injury! But I enjoyed my 13 minutes of fame. I used to play quite a lot of football but I've not played in years and my legs couldn't handle it!</p>

<p>'The boys had a brilliant time. The score was 5-3 and Daniel handed out the Man of the Match award and everyone got their medals.</p>

<p>'And Daniel watched the game along with my wife and my mum and dad so it was an emotional time really. The main goal is to get something workable. As a family we've got to look outside the box.' </p>
