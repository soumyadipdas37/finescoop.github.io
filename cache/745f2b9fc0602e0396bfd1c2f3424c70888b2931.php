<p>The 'it' couple has faced plenty of criticism over their 22-year age gap, as DiCaprio has been known to date in her very specific age group.</p>

<p>The Valley Girl actress isn't bothered by it though, which she admitted to the Los Angeles Times in December.</p>

<p>She said: 'There’s so many relationships in Hollywood — and in the history of the world — where people have large age gaps. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.'</p>

<p>Morrone added of being referred to as 'Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend': 'I feel like there should always be an identity besides who you're dating... I understand the association, but I’m confident that will continue to slip away and be less of a conversation.' </p>

<p>Just a number: The Valley Girl actress isn't bothered by criticism of their age gap, stating: 'I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date'</p>
