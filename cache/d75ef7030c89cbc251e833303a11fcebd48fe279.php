<p>Awkward: Alexandra Burke's Thursday got off to a bad start after the former X Factor winner was confronted with an unwanted parking ticket</p>

<p>It is thought that Alexandra inadvertently parked in a suspended bay, prompting a conversation with the attendant about signage after returning to  the vehicle sometime later. </p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for further comment. </p>

<p>In stark contrast to her seemingly confrontational episode the Hertfordshire based singer looked relaxed in a loose fitting grey sweater and gym leggings during her latest outing. </p>

<p>She teamed her outfit with a pair of smart Yeezy Boost trainers, while her long hair was worn loose and neatly styled with a centre parting. </p>

<p>Returning to her car following a discussion with the warden, Alexandra peeled off her sweater to reveal a distinctive black crop top that partially exposed her abs. </p>

<p>There it is: Alexandra clutched the offending ticket after retrieving it from her windshield </p>

<p>Not happy: The singer didn't look happy after returning to her personalised Range Rover following a walk with her pet dog</p>

<p>Let's talk: Appearing somewhat annoyed, Alexandra was seen remonstrating with a hapless parking attendant before making her way back to her car</p>

<p>Alexandra's comes after she made an emotional revelation that she was told to bleach her skin after she won The X Factor in 2008.</p>

<p>The musician spoke in a candid Instagram video in which she said she was told she would have to work 'ten times harder than a white artist'.</p>

<p>The Islington native, who is of Jamaican descent, also spoke about the 'microagressions' she experienced from various music labels throughout her career and how she has struggled to make her mark. </p>

<p>Getting things straight: It is thought that Alexandra inadvertently parked in a suspended bay, prompting a conversation with the attendant about signage after returning to the vehicle sometime later</p>

<p>Low-key look: The Hertfordshire based singer looked relaxed in a loose fitting grey sweater and gym leggings during her latest outing</p>

<p>Pointing it out: Alexandra engaged in an animated discussion with the parking attendant after receiving her ticket on Thursday </p>

<p>Follow me: The star's dog appeared to take the lead as they made their way back onto the pavement </p>

<p>She explained: 'The music industry is such a funny little place. I love signing, I love what I do but if it wasn't for the love that I have for music I definitely wouldn't be in this industry.</p>

<p>'A few reasons are, when I won the X Factor I was told, ''Right, because you are black, you are going to have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin...</p>

<p>'You can't have braids, you can't have an afro, you can't have anything that basically is my identity, you have to have hair, for example, that appeals to white people so they can understand you better.''</p>

<p>'That was so hard to digest. I was told to bleach my skin and that was something I refused to do.'</p>

<p>Let's go: She was seen loading her pet dog into the car as she prepared to set off later that morning </p>

<p>Looking good: The singer revealed a black crop top after removing her sweater ahead of the journey home</p>

<p>All set: Alexandra closed to the car door behind her pet dog before climbing behind the wheel</p>
