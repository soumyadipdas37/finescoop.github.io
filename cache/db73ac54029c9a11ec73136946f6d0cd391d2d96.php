<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victoria has recorded 45 new coronavirus cases and five deaths as anti-lockdown protesters prepare to rally in Melbourne again.</p>

<p>The new cases reported on Friday come after the state's daily infections dropped to 28 on Thursday - the first time the figures have been in the 20s since June 24. </p>

<p>The people who have died include one man in his 50s, one man in his 70s, one man in his 80s and two women in their 90s. All of those deaths are linked to aged care. </p>

<p>The daily update comes as disgruntled Melburnians revealed they are planning to take to the streets again in protest of the city's Stage Four lockdown restrictions. </p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner Rick Nugent told 3AW's Neil Mitchell police received a warning email from a protester.  </p>

<p>Protesters have warned there will be further anti-lockdown rallies in Melbourne this weekend. Pictured: Police scuffle with protesters during an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne on Sunday September 13</p>

<p>Over the last two weekends protesters have clashed with police at the Shrine Of Remembrance, The Tan track and Queen Victoria Market. Police arrested 74 people and issued at least 176 infringement notices during last Sunday's protest at the market. Pictured: Police move protesters on through the Queen Victoria Market</p>

<p>'The organiser of the protest sent an email to us … advising us that if we refuse to allow them we will be jeopardising the safety of others and Victoria Police would be putting all Victorians at risk,' he said.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately, we're just going to have to continue to drag police off other functions and other roles to police these people in the city.' </p>

<p>It will be the third weekend protesters have gathered at inner-city landmarks to rally against the state government's Stage Four restrictions in Melbourne. </p>

<p>Over the last two weekends protesters have clashed with police at the Shrine Of Remembrance, The Tan track and Queen Victoria Market.</p>

<p>Police arrested 74 people and issued at least 176 infringement notices during last Sunday's protest at the market. </p>

<p>'We've had the Shrine, we've had the Tan, we've had the market,' Mr Nugent said. </p>

<p>'We'll just continue to enforce, I mean, the moment they turn up to protest it's a criminal offence.'</p>

<p>Residents in regional Victoria are now enjoying eased coronavirus restrictions after they moved away from Stage Three lockdown at 11.59pm on Wednesday.    </p>

<p>Pubs, cafes and restaurants are able to serve people outside with strict density quotas, while outdoor gathering limits will be upped to 10.</p>

<p>Regional Victorians are also able to leave their homes without restriction and all shops can reopen.</p>

<p>They will still be able to travel via Melbourne to reach other parts of the state, but can only stop for three reasons including food, care and permitted work and study.</p>

<p>Caravan parks and camping grounds in regional areas were also allowed to reopen from Thursday, but with group booking restrictions.</p>

<p>Melbourne residents who leave the city without a lawful excuse will be fined $4,957.</p>

<p>The new offence is designed to deter Melburnians from entering regional Victoria.</p>

<p>It will be bolstered by beefed-up roadblocks, creating lengthy traffic delays as vehicles pass through.</p>

<p>Melbourne's new case average must stay between 30 to 50 for some of the city's restrictions to be eased as planned on September 28.</p>
