<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cheer star Gabi Butler took to Instagram on Friday and shared her heartbreak in an emotional response to the stunning arrest of her friend and former teammate, Jerry Harris. </p>

<p>The FBI arrested Harris in Chicago on Thursday and charged him with producing child pornography. According to federal court records, the 21-year-old is accused of contacting an underage boy on social media and trying to entice him 'to produce sexually explicit videos and photos of himself' and send them to Harris. </p>

<p>'Like most of you, I am shocked, dismayed, and deeply saddened by the recent news concerning my friend and former teammate Jerry Harris,' Butler began in her lengthy statement. </p>

<p>Emotional: Gabi Butler, 22, shared her heartbreak over the arrest of friend and Cheer co-star Jerry Harris on a producing child pornography charge</p>

<p>Disbelief: The Cheer star confessed she is still crying uncontrollably over the arrest of Harris and the allegations levied against him</p>

<p>Butler confessed she has been crying uncontrollably since learning the news of her friend's arrest and the allegations levied against him. She also shared how she's still 'trying to wrap my head around why something like this could happen.'</p>

<p>'To be clear, although I have been a close friend and teammate with Jerry, I was never aware of anything like what he has been accused of taking place,' the 22-year-old cheerleader added.</p>

<p>'I believe the protection of children is more than important than ever in today's world and absolutely do not condone any actions that bring harm to a child.' </p>

<p>She concluded: 'Issuing a statement like this hurts my heart more than any of you will ever know. As a Christian woman, the only thing I know to do is pray for all involved and the world we live in. My heart is broken.' </p>

<p>Stunned: Butler said she was not aware of anything Harris has been accused of in recent days</p>

<p>Personal tragedy: Butler also shared about being the victim of sexual abuse as a child and how she knows all too well 'the pain of experiencing this type of abuse and the difficulties it can create for life after such trauma'</p>

<p>About an hour after her initial statement, Butler shared about being the victim of sexual abuse as a child and how she knows all too well 'the pain of experiencing this type of abuse and the difficulties it can create for life after such trauma.'</p>

<p>She confessed to being 'broken to pieces' over the situation, and then made a plea to those who may be feeling tempted to approach a child in a sexual way.</p>

<p>'Please seek major psychological help,' she wrote before adding, 'This type of behavior only ruins lives and damages everyone around you. We must do better. We must protect our children.'</p>

<p>In a third post, Butler shared her shock over how her 'best friend' could do such a thing, and then addressed Harris directly about confessing to any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>'One thing I will always respect about you Jerry... admitting your wrongs. It takes a lot of courage to come forward instead of trying to hide it away,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Shocking: The FBI arrested and charged Harris on Thursday on a production of child pornography charge; he is seen in January 2020</p>

<p>Stunned: Butler also talked about her shock over how her 'best friend' could do such a thing</p>

<p>Thursday's arrest came just days after 14-year-old cheerleading twin brothers in Texas filed a lawsuit alleging Harris solicited sexually explicit photos from them for a year and asked one of them for oral sex.</p>

<p>Harris, who became famous for his positive attitude and eccentric personality in the 2020 Netflix docuseries Cheer, appeared before a U.S. Magistrate Judge later on Thursday but did not enter a plea. Harris was ordered to be remain detained until a hearing on Monday that would determine if he could be released on bond. </p>

<p>Harris also allegedly admitted to soliciting explicit photos from dozens of other underage boys and engaging in a sex act with a 15-year-old at a cheer competition.  </p>

<p>The six-part series, Cheer, followed the nationally ranked 40-member Navarro College Bulldogs Cheer Team from Corsicana, Texas under the direction of coach Monica Aldama, as they prepared to compete in the National Cheerleading Championship held annually in Daytona Beach, Florida.</p>

<p>Bonafide hit: LaDarius Marshall, coach Monica Aldama, Gabi Butler and Jerry Harris are among the stars of the Netflix docuseries Cheer; they are pictured in January 2020 in New York City</p>
