<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Tinder creep who abused a woman who rejected him online has struck again, with a second victim coming forward. </p>

<p>Sydney brewery manager Erin Hinds, 26, matched with tech worker Tom, 28, last month on the dating platform. </p>

<p>He invited her to his Bondi home where they met for a drink before spending the night together. </p>

<p>But two days later when she told him she was not interested in taking things further, he bombarded her with horrific derogatory messages. </p>

<p>'I said sorry, I have changed my mind. It was fun but we really don't have chemistry. That is when he flipped the switch,' Ms Hinds told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'He went crazy.'</p>

<p>'He started calling me a w*<strong>e and a s</strong>t then taking pictures of my friends from social media and sending them to me saying that we are all retards, disgusting w****s with bad dental hygiene, and s***ts only worth one f**k each.' </p>

<p>Ms Hinds experience mirrors that of Ebonie Sanderson, 26, who shared images on Instagram this week of messages she had received from Tom after she declined an invitation to his house. </p>

<p>In the appalling tirade, he called her a 'fat f**ing pig', 'f***ing ugly' and said she had 'wasted his time'. </p>

<p>Ms Sanderson's post was quickly picked up by Clementine Ford and her feminist army whose social media campaign got him fired in less than 24 hours. </p>

<p>Ms Ford claimed that three more women had contacted her since claiming they had been threatened by the same man.</p>

<p>'One of them, he threatened to share her intimate photographs with her friends and family. The other, he said he would hit if he saw her in the street,' Ms Ford claimed. </p>

<p>Ms Hinds (pictured) said Tom began sending her abusive messages after she told him she was not interested in meeting up again</p>

<p>Tom (pictured left) sent Ms Hinds messages calling her a 'w<strong><em>e' and a 's</em></strong>t' then asked her friends for her home address</p>

<p>A message Tom sent to Ms Hinds of her friend, calling them derogatory names</p>

<p>However, Ms Hind's abuse continued beyond the twisted messages, with Tom taking to targeting her friends and threatening to stalk her at work.  </p>

<p>After coping mounds of abuse, Ms Hinds said Tom began messaging her friends asking them to give him her home address.</p>

<p>Terrified, she quickly blocked him on all of her social media accounts.  </p>

<p>The next day, she matched with a guy called 'Ryan' on Tinder, who later claimed he was a friend of Tom.   </p>

<p>'He said he remembered where I worked and threatened to come in,' Ms Hinds said. </p>

<p>'I asked them not to harass me at work or I would call the police.  Then I blocked them.'</p>

<p>In messages provided to Daily Mail Australia, 'Ryan' told Ms Hinds that he and 'Tom' expected 'excellent customer service' when they arrived, to remember to 'smile' and that 'customers are always right'. </p>

<p>A day after blocking Tom, Ms Hinds matched with 'Ryan' (pictured), who later claimed he was one of Tom's friends</p>

<p>'Ryan' then started calling Ms Hinds a s**t and started discussing her interaction with Tom </p>

<p>Ms Hinds contacted police who told her she has the right to file a restraining order. She is still waiting to hear back regarding the application. </p>

<p>Ms Hinds said Tom had been pleasant up until the point she decided to break things off.  </p>

<p>Now, she feels traumatised and unsafe. </p>

<p>'It has really shaken me up. I haven't gone on a Tinder date since. I was scared of going into work in case he turned up.' </p>

<p>'I wish I had never met up with him. I feel absolutely disgusting.'</p>

<p>Ms Hinds said she was inspired to come forward after hearing about Ms Sanderson's experience and hopes it will help other women speak out against unacceptable behaviour.  </p>

<p>'I brushed it aside thinking it had only happened to me, I did not realise there were others,' she said. </p>

<p>'It just insane. Why is this is still happening in 2020?'</p>

<p>Ebonie Sanderson (pictured), 26, shared abusive messages Tom sent her on Instagram this week, which lead to his termination at work</p>

<p>In Snapchat messages, Tom told her she was ' inferior' and 'the dysgenic like you are there to serve us'</p>

<p>On Saturday, Ms Sanderson shared the lurid exchanges and aggressive voicemails she received from Tom after turning down his offer to join him at his home. </p>

<p>'This is what happens when you say NO or call out a man for being disrespectful,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'You apparently earn yourself the right to get verbally abused and fat-shamed on more than one platform.</p>

<p>'No I didn't 'ask for it' and yes, I'm entitled to change my mind and tell someone I'm not interested anymore because I feel uncomfortable and intimidated by one's aggressive and forceful nature.'</p>

<p>In Snapchat messages, Tom told her she was ' inferior' and 'the dysgenic like you are there to serve us'.</p>

<p>'You're actually a fat f***ing pig. You know that? Thanks. You did waste my time,' he said.</p>

<p>'You're f*<strong>ing ugly. Your a</strong> looks OKAY and you would have been one f***. You would have been just one f*** because you're a disgusting fat pig.'  </p>

<p>When she called him out for his aggressive behaviour he then doubled down and defended himself.</p>

<p>'Look at my f***ing face. I don't have to struggle to get laid. I especially don't need a FOUR like you to get laid.'</p>

<p>Clementine Ford shared the series of messages on Friday night along with a screenshot of the man's LinkedIn profile and the name of the company where he worked. </p>

<p>'Tom' sent Ms Sanderson abusive messages on Snapchat (pictured) after declining an offer to go round to his house </p>

<p>The post went viral, with thousands of women rallying around Ms Sanderson in a show of support. </p>

<p>Ms Ford later told followers she had learned Tom had been fired from his employer as a result of his behaviour. </p>

<p>Tom's boss told Daily Mail Australia he dismissed him after receiving a flood of angry emails this morning. </p>

<p>'I had a read through of the contract and validated that it was an act of serious misconduct and that he was no longer fit for employment with us,' he said.</p>

<p>The CEO said he was 'shocked and disgusted' by the messages. </p>

<p>'There is just no place in our workplace for someone who treats women with that amount of disrespect.</p>

<p>'I have four daughters aged between 10 months and nine years old so that was one of the first things I thought about, and my blood boiled to imagine someone to ever speak to one of my little girls like that.' </p>

<p>Tom's social media accounts on LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook have disappeared since the posts were shared.    </p>

<p>'If anyone comes across this man on dating apps or social media, please report him,' Ms Sanderson wrote. Pictured: Tom's Tinder profile</p>
