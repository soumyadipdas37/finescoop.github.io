<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A couple who wanted to avoid spending hundreds of dollars on an outdoor furniture set have shared how they built their own stylish day bed for only $78 using wooden pallets, three Kmart dog beds and cushions.</p>

<p>Kmart fan Kayla shared how she and her partner did it to a popular Australian décor Facebook group and revealed how the pair made the outdoor setup.</p>

<p>'My partner and I wanted to get a day bed for our deck but didn't want to pay $500+ so we came up with the idea to get pallets which we painted (free) and added Kmart dog beds to it!' she said.</p>

<p>The dog beds are priced at $20 each and the department store sells a selection of cushions for as little as $4 each.</p>

<p>Rather than spending hundreds of dollars on an outdoor furniture set, a savvy DIY couple have built a stylish day bed for only $78 using pallets, three Kmart dog beds and cushions (pictured)</p>

<p>The pair painted the free pallets to use as the base of the couch before placing the pet beds on top.  </p>

<p>To complete the look, the couple purchased multiple Kmart cushions and said the end result feels 'so comfortable'.</p>

<p>The outdoor day bed is now the couple's favourite spot to lounge in the house.  </p>

<p>Thousands of other social media users were impressed with the idea and were inspired to replicate the bed themselves.</p>

<p>'Omg of course! Dog bed cushions, durable [and] waterproof,' one person said.</p>

<p>The dog beds are priced at $20 each</p>

<p>'Okay this is hands down one of the best hacks I've ever seen!' another said.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I've done a similar thing but used an old single bed mattress. I put it inside a Kmart king single doona cover'.</p>

<p>'If you have any issues of the cushions slipping when you're sitting on it, add Velcro strips to the top of the pallet and the bottom of the cushion!' another suggested.</p>

<p>More than 2,600 people 'liked' the Facebook post and 266 left a comment by praising the idea or tagging a friend. </p>

<p>The clever idea is easy to replicate but would be suitable to those who prefer lower couches.  </p>

<p>The $20 pet beds are available on the Kmart website or across stores if stock hasn't sold out prior.</p>
