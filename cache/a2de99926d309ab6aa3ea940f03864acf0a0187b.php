<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago is endearing himself to Liverpool fans on and off the pitch already, revealing his respect for an important club tradition. </p>

<p>The £25million signing from Bayern Munich was followed by a camera crew on his first day at Anfield when he was unveiled. </p>

<p>He stopped underneath the famous 'This is Anfield' sign above the tunnel leading out to the pitch explained that he learned about it from former Liverpool No 9 Fernando Torres. </p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara spoke about respecting the tradition of not touching the 'This is Anfield' sign</p>

<p>The midfielder heard from Fernando Torres about how important the sign is at the club</p>

<p>Torres, pictured here with Rafael Benitez, opted to touch the sign when he joined the club</p>

<p>'As I heard once from Torres, this remains ever the place we pass by, for four more years [in my case],' Thiago said.</p>

<p>'And to touch this symbol we have to deserve it and to win as many trophies as we can.</p>

<p>'That's why today I will not. I will respect this tradition.' </p>

<p>Thiago, 29, is an impressive individual with the ability to speak fluent English, Portuguese, Spanish and German and clearly has educated himself on all things Liverpool prior to joining. </p>

<p>Thiago wants to win things with Liverpool before he allows himself to touch the sign </p>

<p>The club's new No 6 is yet to play his first game at Anfield but given his record as a serial winner, fans will be hoping he will be able to touch the sign before long. </p>

<p>Thiago has won seven Bundesliga titles, two LaLiga crowns and the same number of Champions Leagues. </p>

<p>He dazzled on debut in the 2-0 win over Chelsea, despite giving away a penalty that Alisson duly saved from Jorginho. </p>

<p>Despite only playing 45 minutes, the Spaniard out-passed every Chelsea player. He made 75 passes after coming on for Jordan Henderson and pulled the strings, albeit against 10 men. </p>

<p>He may have the chance to play for Liverpool at Anfield for the first time on Thursday in the home Carabao Cup clash with Lincoln City or Jurgen Klopp could wait for Monday's Premier League game against Arsenal.  </p>

<p>The 29-year-old completed 75 passes against Chelsea, more than any of the Blues </p>

<p>The Spaniard helped his side to a 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge to keep up the unbeaten start</p>
