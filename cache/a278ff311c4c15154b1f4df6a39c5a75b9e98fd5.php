<p>The Manhattan actress opted for a laid-back version of her signature style while taking a walk with 20-year-old son Duke Keaton in Santa Monica on Monday.</p>

<p>While Diane, 74, kept on the felt hat and a tailored jacket, she gave things a California twist by donning cuffed jeans with the ensemble.</p>

<p>La dee da: Diane Keaton showed off her signature Annie Hall style while walking around Santa Monica with son Duke on Monday</p>

<p>Her penchant monochrome patterns was on display via a polka dots scarf and a plaid face mask.</p>

<p>Subtly checkered shoes with a chunk heel completed the Academy Award winner's look.</p>

<p>This year Diane was mentioned in her ex-boyfriend Woody Allen's memoir Apropos Of Nothing.</p>

<p>In the tome, the controversial writer/actor/director, 84, said that he not only dated the actress, but also both of her sisters. </p>

<p>'I dated her stunning sister, Robin, and we had a short romance,' Allen wrote in his book. </p>

<p>He gets around: This year Diane was mentioned in her ex-boyfriend Woody Allen's memoir Apropos Of Nothing. In the book he mentions dating three of the Keaton sisters. The former couple are seen in 1977's Annie Hall together above</p>

<p>'After that I dated her different stunning sister, Dory, and we had a bit fling. The three Keaton sisters had been all stunning, fantastic ladies.'</p>

<p>For Allen fans, this awkward situation might sound familiar - seemingly the inspiration for 1986's Hannah And Her Sisters - which starred Mia Farrow, Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest.</p>

<p>Allen met Diane when she tried out for a role in his 1972 comedy Play it Again, Sam.</p>
