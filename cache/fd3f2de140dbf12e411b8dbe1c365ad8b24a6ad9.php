<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The thousands of Australians who have bought pets during the coronavirus lockdowns have been warned to watch out for paralysis ticks as the weather warms up.</p>

<p>Queensland veterinarian Dr Holly Goldring said her clinic is seeing more cases of pets being preyed on by ticks than usual this year.</p>

<p>While long-term pet owners are aware of the danger, the increase in cases could be due to the many first-time owners. </p>

<p>'We are seeing more cats because people probably don't know there is a good preventative for them,' she told the ABC. </p>

<p>Queensland veterinarian Dr Holly Goldring said her clinic is seeing more cases of pets being preyed on by ticks than usual this year (stock)</p>

<p>She said outside pets are the most vulnerable and pet owners should pay attention to changes in an animal's behaviour.</p>

<p>Dr Goldring said a dog or cat that seems off-colour or lacking its usual energy should set off alarm bells.</p>

<p>However, it does take pets a few days to start feeling unwell. </p>

<p>Dr Goldring said pet owners should get their pets regularly checked for ticks as they can be hard to find.</p>

<p>'When we know we are looking for a tick it can take 20-30 minutes to find it, and that's professionals doing it,' she said.</p>

<p>'Often it's only until they have fed for a couple of days and they are big that you can find them, and then it's a bit late.'</p>

<p>She said no pet should die of tick paralysis in 2020.</p>

<p>Dr Goldring said pet owners should check their dog's paws and face for ticks after they have been in a leafy environment, as those are the most common places.</p>

<p>However, she noted there have been instances where ticks have been found between claws or under tails. </p>

<p>Dr Anne Chester, RSPCA QLD's senior veterinarian, has previously made similar comments about ticks to pet owners.  </p>

<p>'Our main concern is the paralysis tick,' she said. </p>

<p>'All pet owners should seek advice from their vet on the best form of tick prevention. </p>

<p>'You really do need to check for ticks daily, even if they are taking tick preventives.'</p>

<p>She suggested that pet owners also look out for dry coughs, or a change in a bark or meow.  </p>
