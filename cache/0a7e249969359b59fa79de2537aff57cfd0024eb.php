<p>Garland was Barack Obama's choice to fill an empty Supreme Court seat, after Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.</p>

<p>Mitch McConnell, the Republican serving as leader of the Senate, blocked Garland's appointment, and declared any appointment by the sitting president to be null and void. He said the next Supreme Court justice should be chosen by the next president — to be elected later that year.  </p>

<p>Ginsburg's dying wish, dictated to her granddaughter Clara Spera and first reported by NPR, underscored the battle she knew was coming.</p>

<p>'My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed,' she said.</p>
