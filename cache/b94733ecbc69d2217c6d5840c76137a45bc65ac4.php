<p>Stephen Hall, 83, sped through an army road stop at Morangup, north-west of Perth on May 10 in his silver Jeep.</p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to failing to stop, failing to comply with a direction of the emergency management act and dangerous driving at Perth Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Perth grandfather Stephen Hall (pictured), 83, has been banned from driving for life after speeding away from a coronavirus checkpoint in May</p>

<p>Hall, of Armadale, was fined $8500 in total for the three charges and prohibited from ever operating a vehicle again.   </p>

<p>The court heard officers pursued him for 27km through the town of Toodyay before they finally punctured his tyres using a stinger.  </p>

<p>The grandfather, who said he was on his way to see a friend in the town, stopped at the checkpoint to speak with an Australian Defence Force officer.</p>

<p>The elderly driver was told he was not allowed to pass through, but accelerated through the checkpoint regardless.</p>

<p>Police prosecutors said during the chase Hall had driven at speeds up to 136km/ph and veered into the other lane.  </p>

<p>Lawyer Katherine Dowling argued against a jail sentence, telling the court Hall was in the first stages of Alzheimer's and dementia and has been living in squalor for years.</p>

<p>The court heard Hall drove at speeds exceeding 130km/h in his Jeep (pictured) before police stopped him using a stinger</p>

<p>She said he is now living in a care facility.</p>

<p>Days after his arrest, Hall told reporters he believed he had done nothing wrong and police owe him a new set of tyres.</p>

<p>'There were four coppers after me. I gave them a right run for their money. They’ve never had a run like that,' he previously told 9News. </p>

<p>'First of all they are paying for a new set of tyres, all four of them, Coopers sports.'</p>

<p>'I’ve done nothing wrong, but I put my foot down.' </p>

<p>Hall previously told reporters he believed he had done nothing wrong and the officers owed him a new set of tyres</p>
