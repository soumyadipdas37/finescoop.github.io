<p>He then approached a female customer and offered her a sample of the yogurt.</p>

<p>Several customers at the supermarket where Garcia worked were targeted by the 32-year-old</p>

<p>US Attorney Gonzales said: 'This conduct at issue in this case is not a joke, and it is not funny. It is criminal, and the sentence imposed on Garcia should serve as a warning to those who deliberately adulterate food for the purpose of causing harm to innocent consumers, or as malicious pranks, or for deviant sexual gratification.</p>

<p>'My Office will continue to work with the FDA to vigorously investigate and prosecute this type of criminal conduct.'</p>
