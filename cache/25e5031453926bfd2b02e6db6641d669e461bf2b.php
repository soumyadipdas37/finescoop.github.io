<p>Captain Tom Moore (pictured on ITV's Life Stories) asked for a can of Coke, a Dairy Milk bar and 'six blondes' in his dressing room when he appeared on TV with Piers Morgan</p>

<p>'He told me the number of blondes was "variable". He's a real ladies' man. He said to me, "Let me put it like this; I'm not allergic to girls".</p>

<p>'A lot of women would like to have a cup of tea with Captain Tom - he's an unashamed ladies' man, in the nicest possible way.'</p>

<p>Morgan previously revealed Captain Tom is 'even more charming in real life' after interviewing him for Life Stories, which will air on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Last week, he shared a picture of them backstage on his Instagram page, writing: 'The great man! Backstage with Captain Sir Tom Moore before our Life Stories chat. </p>

<p>'First time we've met in person and he's even more charming in real life. Should be a brilliant interview.' </p>

<p>A TV insider said the GMB host was 'in awe' when he finally met his hero Captain Tom in person for the first time. </p>

<p>'In the dark days of lock-down, it was everyday heroes, not celebs, who brought joy to the nation.</p>

<p>In April, Piers Morgan donated £10,000 to Captain Tom Moore's 'magnificently inspiring' fundraising campaign for the NHS while he was live on Good Morning Britain.  </p>

<p>The GMB presenter said: 'Captain Tom Moore, thank you for serving your country. I'm so glad that we were able, through the brilliant NHS, to serve you back and keep you going.</p>

<p>'Good luck - I want to get you over the line today. Here's what I'm going to do, Tom, I'm going to put £10,000 of my own money into your fundraising today and I hope that encourages everyone watching at home to do the same.' </p>

<p>Morgan called for a knighthood for Captain Tom in April, before the war veteran received the honour from the Queen at Windsor Castle in July.   </p>
