<p>It comes after Stacey was said to be in the running to host a new morning show on the BBC that will be similar to The One Show, with Rylan Clark-Neal also said to be a contender, according to The Mail On Sunday. </p>

<p>Starting at 9.15am, the new show is expected to challenge ITV's mid-morning stars Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, as well as seeking to attract viewers from Lorraine Kelly's hour-long show that runs from 9am.</p>

<p>BBC executives hope the programme will also retain viewers from the Breakfast show, which draws an estimated nine million each week.</p>

<p>Contenders: Stacey was said to be in the running to host a new morning show on the BBC that will be similar to The One Show, with Rylan Clark-Neal also said to be a contender</p>

<p>A source close to the project said: 'BBC Breakfast beats Good Morning Britain every day and The One Show is one of the channel's most loved and popular programmes, so the concept is based on that.</p>

<p>'The thinking is that if they can put a daytime version of the show on straight after BBC Breakfast, they'll keep some of those viewers, and will follow the same formula as The One Show but with segments tailored to a new daytime audience.</p>

<p>'Everyone at the BBC is very excited about this. They know that this could be quite the rival for This Morning, for the first time ever.' </p>

<p>Competition: The show is set to rival ITV's This Morning, hosted by Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield </p>
