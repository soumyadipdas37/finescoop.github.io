<p>The show will also return to its regular, one-hour format, after a summer hosted by special guests and episodes that have only been a half hour long for the past few months.  </p>

<p>Prior to that, like all other late night hosts in response to the coronavirus pandemic, Kimmel was holding court at his home for the show.</p>

<p>And back in June, Jimmy revealed that he would be taking some time off as host of the show. </p>

<p>'I've been doing this job for almost 18 years,' he told viewers at the time. 'I've done 3,130 shows and there's nothing wrong. My family is healthy, I'm healthy. </p>

<p>'I just need a couple of months off,' he concluded.</p>

<p>In the interim, a series of guest hosts have filled in for Kimmel, including Billy Eichner, Anthony Anderson and others.  </p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel Live's last guest hosts for the summer — Josh Gad, Brad Paisley, John Legend and Samuel L. Jackson — will appear on the show during the week after Labor Day. </p>

<p>JKL will then air rerun episodes over the week of September 14th, while Jimmy and his crew prepare for the Emmy Awards on the 20th.</p>

<p>The hosting gig will be a new one for the funnyman, as the event marks the first major awards show of the season to be held virtually as a result of the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Kimmel himself is up for three Emmy trophies this year, including two for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and one for Outstanding Variety Special (Live) as a producer of last year's Live in Front of a Studio Audience: 'All in the Family' and 'Good Times'.</p>

<p>He won his first-ever Emmy Award last year in that category, for co-producing a similar live broadcast of Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons.</p>

<p>And although Jimmy still has roughly three weeks before his Emmys hosting gig and return to JKL immediately following, he's already been seen back at work at another job this month – hosting the second season of ABC's reboot of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire.</p>
