<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tens of thousands of 18-year-olds could unknowingly be entitled to a payout from a child trust fund set up on their behalf. </p>

<p>The funds were launched 15 years ago with every child born between September 1, 2002 and January 31, 2011 given a helping hand from the Government in the form of a voucher worth £250. </p>

<p>In some cases a further top-up payment of £250 was made if the child was born between September 1, 2009 and July 31, 2010. Poorer families received £500 in each case. </p>

<p>Helping hand: Many funds will now be maturing without the account holder knowing they are eligible to receive the proceeds </p>

<p>Though many parents added to the new-style savings accounts, others did not use the voucher. The Government responded by setting up a stakeholder account on the child's behalf. Many of these funds will now be maturing without the account holder knowing they are eligible to receive the proceeds. </p>

<p>This is especially true for those who have moved home in the past 15 years and so have not received any paperwork. In some cases, the payouts could be four-figure sums. </p>

<p>Eighteen-year-olds can find details of their fund by visiting https://gov.uk/child-trust-funds/ find-a-child-trust-fund. Also, the Share Foundation charity can help those aged 16 and over locate their fund. </p>

<p>From age 16, an individual can take control of their account, but they cannot withdraw money until they are 18. Visit findctf.sharefound.org to fill in the form. </p>

<p>Those whose child trust funds are maturing can take the money – or invest it in a tax-friendly Isa. </p>

<p>On average, some 55,000 18-year-olds a month will be eligible for a pay-out between now and 2029. </p>
