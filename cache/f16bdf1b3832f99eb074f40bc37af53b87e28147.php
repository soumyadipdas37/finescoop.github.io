<p>As part of a package of measures, Mr Sunak said the new jobs support scheme was aimed at protecting 'viable' roles rather than all posts which have been kept going as a result of state support under the furlough programme.</p>

<p>Under the terms of the new scheme, the Government will top up the wages of people working at least a third of their normal hours.</p>
