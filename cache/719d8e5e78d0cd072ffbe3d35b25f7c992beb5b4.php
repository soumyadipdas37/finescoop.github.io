<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Bachelor elimination ceremony usually involves tears, plenty of hugs and a long limousine ride away from the mansion.</p>

<p>But not for Bel Colwell, who was the first girl to be sent home by Locky Gilbert during the 'virtual rose ceremony' on Thursday night's episode.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old told Who magazine that being sent home during 'love in lockdown' was a bizarre and lonely experience.</p>

<p>Brutal: On Friday, The Bachelor's Bel Colwell (pictured) revealed to Who magazine what it was really like to be eliminated during a virtual rose ceremony on The Bachelor</p>

<p>'I don't recommend it to anyone... There's a red rose just staring at you and then you just close the laptop,' she said.</p>

<p>'Obviously, it's better to be with everyone because you can hug everyone goodbye and have a moment with Locky if you need it for that closure,' she added.</p>

<p>Bel, who was at her home on the night she was sent packing, had only her producer to turn to for comfort after being abruptly cut off the Zoom call.</p>

<p>'I don't recommend it to anyone... There's a red rose just staring at you and then you just close the laptop,' Bel said of her elimination (Pictured on Zoom with the other women) </p>

<p>'It was nice, he sat with me in the house afterwards and asked me if I was okay,' she said.</p>

<p>At the end of Thursday's episode, the series' first-ever virtual rose ceremony saw each of the remaining ladies standing by a rose.</p>

<p>However, they could only pick it up if Locky called out their name.</p>

<p>After Bel failed to receive her rose, she waved goodbye to the other ladies before her screen abruptly blanked out.</p>

<p>No closure: 'Obviously, it's better to be with everyone because you can hug everyone goodbye and have a moment with Locky if you need it for that closure,' she added</p>

<p>Fans criticised the ceremony on Twitter, with one viewer pointing out how 'weird' it must have been for Bel to be dumped like that.</p>

<p>'So Bel has a rose next to her but she can't "accept" it? What a weird way to do it? Could they have not thought of anything else,' another wrote.</p>

<p>Many viewers questioned if there could have been a better way to stage the eliminations, saying the Zoom format was 'cringeworthy' and 'awkward'.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>

<p>Abrupt: Bel was given just seconds to awkwardly say goodbye before her screen blanked out </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Epic fail: Following the ceremony, fans slammed the process on Twitter, with one viewer commenting on how 'weird' it must have been for Bel</p>
