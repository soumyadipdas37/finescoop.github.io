<p>Clearly having a great time, Jude was joined by Sadie's beau Darren Stroeger, Jude's parents Peter and Maggie Law, his and Sadie's other children Rafferty and Iris law, her beau Jyrrel Roberts, Sadie's son Finlay Kemp, and her mum Mary Davidson.</p>

<p>Sadie and Jude used to lead the Primrose Hill Set, a name given to the all-star group of edgy residents of the leafy neighbourhood, who were known in their heyday for their wild ways with stories of their antics becoming the stuff of legend.</p>

<p>In the nineties they would spend their nights partying with the likes of Kate Moss, Davinia Taylor and Gavin Rossdale.</p>

<p>But things were not made to last, with Jude and Sadie getting a divorce in 2003, after six years of marriage.</p>

<p>In her autobiography Crazy Days, Sadie blamed depression that 'weaved a dance of destruction' through her adult life on the breakdown of their marriage.</p>

<p>Jude is now married to psychologist Phillipa, 32, who he was first spotted with at the Hay literary festival in 2015.</p>

<p>The couple got married at Old Marylebone Town Hall in London last year before partying in Mayfair – three months after the actor announced their engagement.</p>

<p>The actor also has an ten-year-old daughter Sophia with model Samantha Burke and Ada, five, with musician Catherine Harding.</p>

<p>Dressing up: Rudy donned a black coat over a red striped shirt and grey trousers</p>

<p>A gift? Jude was seen carrying out a painting from the restaurant later on</p>
