<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>While the wrath of Manchester United fans, frustrated by the club's lack of transfer activity, continues to be directed towards Ed Woodward, the lesser-spotted Matt Judge continues to go about his business quietly in the background.</p>

<p>That was until earlier this week at least, whenÂ Patrice Evra's incredible 20-minute tiradeÂ put Judge - and his qualifications as United's chief transfer negotiator - back under the spotlight once more.</p>

<p>Evra claimed that Judge failed to answer a call from a leading sporting director of another club during his busiest time of the season. Having come from a fans' favourite, the suggestion was never going to go down well among supporters.</p>

<p>Very little is known about Matt Judge (rear centre), who is Ed Woodward's right-hand man</p>

<p>But his name was back in the public domain after Patrice Evra's 20-minute rant on Monday</p>

<p>Evra took aim at both Woodward and his chief negotiator Judge over the club's transfer policy</p>

<p>United fans' anger at the board and their failure to get deals over the line has reached boiling point yet again, with the club seemingly still struggling to come to terms with the departures of Sir Alex Ferguson and David Gill seven years ago.Â </p>

<p>This year, supporters' ire regarding transfers has been directed at the uncertainty surrounding the pursuit of Jadon Sancho and the fact they have brought in just one new face in the form of Â£40million midfielder Donny van de Beek.</p>

<p>Borussia Dortmund have repeatedly insisted that Sancho will stay at the Signal Iduna Park this season, with United unwilling to match the Bundesliga side's Â£108m valuation of the player.Â </p>

<p>The current stalemate has left fans shaking their heads at the latest developments when just a few weeks ago they were full of excitement about their potential new signing.</p>

<p>The lack of movement on the Sancho deal was then compounded by a home defeat by Crystal Palace at the weekend in United's first Premier League fixture of the season, and nowÂ Evra has joined in with fans voicing their frustrations by slamming Woodward and Judge for the role they have played in a quiet summer window.Â </p>

<p>'The only problem I would say to Ed is trusting people he should never trust,' Evra said in an astonishing attack on his former club, who he claims have started to 'blow away their legacy'.</p>

<p>Fans have been left frustrated by the uncertainty regarding their pursuit of Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>'He even trusts people outside the club that he shouldn't. When we want a player and they cost say Â£20m, we end up trying to buy him for Â£100m.Â </p>

<p>'Now those players don't even want our money any more. A sporting director from a top club called me and asked me to tell Matt Judge to answer his phone.'</p>

<p>The Frenchman's outburst on his own social media account on Monday is all the more shocking because he was considered to be a supporter of Woodward having sat alongside him in the directors' box on a number of occasions.Â </p>

<p>But what of Judge, the tall, balding man who has just once been snapped walking behind Woodward in club suit and tie at Bournemouth two years ago?</p>

<p>Well, the fact that only one image of him exists on the internet points to the secrecy of his general portfolio.</p>

<p>United fans also want more signings with Donny van de Beek the only man to join so far</p>

<p>Judge joined United eight years ago and has been trusted by Woodward to negotiate transfer deals and contracts for four years afterÂ 13 years of experience in investment banking. But go online in search of further information and prepared to be largely disappointed.</p>

<p>The bio on his LinkedIn page contains no photo and reads simply and rather vaguely: 'Managing Manchester United's equity and debt capital structure â€“ three equity offerings incl the IPO, totalling over $450m; and three debt refinancings ($1bn+) â€“ debt private placement, term-loan and RCF. Also player negotiations (transfers and playing contracts).'</p>

<p>But as one fan highlighted following Evra's outburst, the wording in his bio appears to suggest player negotiations are but a minor part, or afterthought, of his role as opposed to the fundamental role it should represent for every Premier League outfit.Â </p>

<p>This is how Matt Judge describes himself. Notice the â€˜Also player negotiations (transfers and playing contracts)â€™ as if itâ€™s an after thought. You can see his priorities here. ðŸ“ž pic.twitter.com/9fYoDfd4mW</p>

<p>Few doubted he possessed the qualifications to be United's head of corporate development given his banking background.</p>

<p>Yet United are still to appoint a director of football, despite former midfield stars Darren Fletcher and Paul Scholes both being linked to the role.</p>

<p>Due to the vacancy, it has fallen upon Judge to haggle and wheel and deal with opposition clubs, and despite his heavy banking experience there is little to suggest he would adapt well to the complex environment of transfer negotiations.Â Â Â </p>

<p>As revealed by Sportsmail last year, Woodward and Judge preside over a pyramid that oversees a global network of 52 scouts whose information is channelled through scouting chiefs Marcel Bout and Mick Court, as well as the management team now led by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, before United identify their targets.</p>

<p>United are yet to appoint a director of football despite Paul Scholes being linked to the role</p>

<p>Judge is therefore United's de facto chief negotiator and is leading the way on transfer deals yet again this summer, but Dutch star Van de Beek represents the only evidence of his endeavours in a window heavily impacted by the financial slump caused by the coronavirus pandemic.Â </p>

<p>But their modest spend this summer - partly due to the pandemic - does not mean United have become reticent to splash the cash since Judge's arrival in his new post.Â </p>

<p>Paul Pogba returned to Old Trafford in a then world-record Â£89m deal in Judge's first summer in his new role.Â United also splashed out heavily on the likes of Romelu Lukaku one summer later before Alexis Sanchez was brought in from Arsenal in January 2018.</p>

<p>But the duo failed to make the desired impact and are now plying their trade with Inter Milan, and while the Belgian cost the club Â£75m, the Chilean was the highest-paid player in Premier League history on a total of up to Â£560,000 a week at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>United brought back Paul Pogba for a then world record of Â£89m in Judge's first year in the role</p>

<p>Forget Ole, Forget if he's competent or not, stop focusing on the manager or the players.Focus on the board. Focus on Matt Judge. I guarantee you, no manager here will be successful as long as we have those clowns up there running the club. Unite against one common enemy</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Judge, Lukaku and Sanchez do not represent the only flops brought in under his reign, with Henrikh Mkhitaryan signed from Borussia Dortmund for a underwhelming two-year spell at United and Diogo Dalot and Fred brought in from Porto for Â£17m and Â£52m respectively.</p>

<p>Harry Maguire cost the club Â£80m last summer and has divided opinion at the club since his move, while Daniel James' bright start to life at the club has been overshadowed by inconsistency for a while now.</p>

<p>Judge however appears to have got more of a grip on contract renewals, with goalkeeper David de Gea agreeing fresh terms last September, and talks with Pogba over a new deal reportedly progressing well.Â </p>

<p>But such is the significance placed on dealings in the transfer market, United fans' view on Judge will seemingly be impacted by what he manages to do in terms of incomings rather than simply retaining.</p>

<p>However he oversaw the signings of Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku, now of Inter Milan</p>

<p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan was also signed in a unsuccessful two-year spell at Old Trafford by Judge</p>

<p>Following Evra's outburst, one fan commented: 'Forget Ole, Forget if he's competent or not, stop focusing on the manager or the players.</p>

<p>'Focus on the board. Focus on Matt Judge. I guarantee you, no manager here will be successful as long as we have those clowns up there running the club. Unite against one common enemy.'Â </p>

<p>Given his ties to the much-maligned Woodward, Judge face a huge task in trying to restore United's image both in the transfer market and as a Premier League powerhouse on the field. Only then will the fans, and Evra, be convinced of his worth.</p>
