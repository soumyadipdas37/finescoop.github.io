<p>'Some years ago, a misleading video of me chasing the deer in Richmond Park while my owner screamed ''Fenton! Fenton!'' was watched by millions of people worldwide. What the viewer couldn't see was that the deer were leading me on in the most provocative manner.</p>

<p>'Everyone in the DCHCBTF community loves watching videos of humans doing pratfalls, pulling faces and walking into doors.'</p>

<p>In a major TV interview, HRH Prince Andrew insisted that he had 'no recollection, none whatsoever' of ever being married to Sarah Ferguson. </p>

<p>He said he was 'passionate' about 'bringing this dusty old pyramid kicking and screaming into the 21st century'.</p>
