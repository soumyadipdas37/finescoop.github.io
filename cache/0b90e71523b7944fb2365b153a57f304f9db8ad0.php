<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A group of armed men apologised to a family after invading their home and realising they were in the wrong house.   </p>

<p>Samuel and Lupe Aukuso were watching television with their baby daughter and three-year-old son in their home on Mendana Street in Lethbridge Park in Sydney's west at 10:40pm on Monday. </p>

<p>Suddenly the lights went off, prompting the Mr Aukuso, 29, to go outside to the power box and turn it back on.</p>

<p>But the young father was followed back inside by two masked men, one of which was armed with a handgun, while another man stood guard outside.   </p>

<p>Speaking to Nine News, Mr Aukuso said he and his family were 'really scared' that the men were going to shoot them. </p>

<p>'I felt it, there was someone watching me. When I came back in, those two guys, big guys, they enter the house and almost laid hands on me,' he said. </p>

<p>'It was really scary, my wife was screaming, my kids were too. </p>

<p>'They were about do do it, maybe they were about to shoot us. I saw him looking at my kids, then they looked at me and then they suddenly stopped like that. </p>

<p>'He said 'Sorry uce, wrong house' and then I saw him putting away a gun. I don't if it was a gun or a knife but I think it was a handgun, he put it back in his back pocket before he said that.' </p>

<p>Uce is short for uso, which is a Samoan word for brother or sister, depending on gender. In this case, it meant brother.</p>

<p>Parents Samuel (left) and Lupe Aukuso (right) with their three-year-old son and baby daughter. The family were 'really scared' when masked men stormed into their house on Monday night</p>

<p>After realising their mistake and apologising, the men drove off in a Toyota hatchback.  </p>

<p>No one in the Aukoso family was injured and no property was taken. </p>

<p>Detective Chief Inspector Paul Tickner from Mount Druitt Police believes the home invaders were after the previous tenants, who may have been drug dealers.</p>

<p>'Upon realising the people in the house didn't appear to be the people they were looking for they apologised and left the scene,' Mr Tickner said. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately, the people in the house prior to these people appear to be involved in some kind of drug activity.'</p>

<p>The previous tenants of the house moved out more than a year ago.  </p>

<p>Mr Aukuso said one of the men had a handgun and said 'Sorry Uce, wrong house' before leaving</p>
