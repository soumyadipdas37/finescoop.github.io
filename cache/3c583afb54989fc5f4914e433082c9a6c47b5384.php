<p>Busy bee: The TV star brushed up on her beautician skills earlier in the day as she visited beauty training centre Cosmetic Couture Clinic in Manchester</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Lauren revealed in New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. </p>

<p>She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.</p>

<p>'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me. </p>

<p>'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".' </p>

<p>The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.</p>

<p>Lauren recently broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.</p>

<p>Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. </p>

<p>Declaring she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she insisted she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.</p>

<p>Brave: Last month, the glamour model revealed she's undergoing therapy to 'dig into my past' and help overcome her anxiety battle</p>
