<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jadon Sancho will not leave Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United before the transfer window closes next week, club captain Marco Reus has revealed.</p>

<p>The England winger has been Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's No 1 target for months but United have been unwilling to match the Bundesliga side's Â£108million valuation.</p>

<p>And despite Ed Woodward preparing a late bid worth up to Â£90m for Sancho, Reus expects the 20-year-old to remain in Germany for at least another season.Â </p>

<p>Jadon Sancho won't leave Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United, claims Marco Reus</p>

<p>Dortmund captain Reus says Sancho will spend at least another year with the Bundesliga side</p>

<p>"He is an essential player for us." ðŸ–¤ðŸ’›Borussia Dortmund captain Marco Reus has told Sky Germany that Jadon Sancho is staying at the club...</p>

<p>Asked about Sancho staying at Dortmund rather than returning to England, Reus told Sky Germany: 'For us players that was great news.</p>

<p>'We all were happy that he will be with us for one more year because he delivers assists and goals, so we get points.'</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands that United have not yet given up hope of agreeing a deal with Dortmund and are readying a final attempt to bring him to Manchester.</p>

<p>The Red Devils will offer the Bundesliga club Â£65m up-front, with a further Â£25m in add-ons, potentially making the deal worth Â£90m depending on Sancho's success.</p>

<p>Should that bid fail, United will turn to other options. Watford's Ismaila Sarr, Napoli forwardÂ Arkadiusz Milik and Juventus winger Douglas Costa are among those to have been linked with a switch to Old Trafford.</p>

<p>Reus expects Sancho to leave Dortmund at the end of this season, particularly if he continues to develop his game at the same rate.Â </p>

<p>'If he gets as big as (Lionel) Messi or Ronaldo, we will see,' the Germany midfielder added.</p>

<p>'He needs time, experience and it will be important how he manages the times when things don't go so well. But he has the confidence and the quality.'Â </p>

<p>United have endured a frustrating transfer window so far, only signing Holland midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax in a Â£40m deal.Â </p>
