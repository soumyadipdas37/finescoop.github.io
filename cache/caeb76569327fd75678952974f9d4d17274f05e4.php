<p>Backlash: Kim Kardashian spoke up after the brand-new maternity line from her shapewear brand Skims sparked controversy on social media over the weekend</p>

<p>'The belly part doesn't slim your belly, it's actually sheer and a thinner layered material compared to the rest of the garment.</p>

<p>'It provides support to help with the uncomfortable weight being carried in your stomach which affects your lower back - and the compression on the leggings help with pain relief caused by swelling,' she continued. </p>

<p>After giving birth, the mother-of-four explained her products can provide 'comfort and support that most women need after delivery especially if you are recovering from a cesarean.' </p>

<p>This prompted Jameela Jamil, an outspoken advocate for positive body image, to slam the KKW Beauty founder in a new Instagram post, which addresses pregnancy shapewear. </p>

<p>'I will say: I wish we could just normalize just focusing on the inside of a pregnant body, not the outside,' the Good Place star, 34, wrote in an Instagram post. </p>

<p>She added: 'You don't need your shape corrected or hidden. You don't need an even more awkward obstacle between you and a piss. You just need to try and ride with this miracle and do your best to be as happy/comfortable as is possible within your circumstances. Pregnancy is hard enough, with enough worries already.' </p>

<p>'Just wanting to show you and maybe talk a little bit about what pregnancy shapewear is. Basically, the reason I love pregnancy shapewear is because it stops all the folds of my vagina and stomach from eating all other times of underwear,' she said, while standing in her expansive bathroom</p>

<p>'And if you feel self conscious, you are not the problem, who can blame any of us for feeling bad, our society has failed us immensely, and we as a collective need to put more energy into pushing back against this so we can just let a b*tch live!' the British star remarked. </p>

<p>She concluded by telling her followers if she 'ever' has a baby, she will welcome 'the stretch marks' and 'new curves' and not 'rush to try and snap back.'   </p>

<p>'It rolls up in there, and doesn't even look like I have underwear on,' she explained. 'Most importantly this is not about creating a body we don't know we have. Like, we're not trying to do anything to trick you, we're pregnant.'  </p>

<p>As she continued to list her reasons for wearing shapewear, Teigen pointed out she was just trying to make herself feel good at a time, which she says 'can be really challenging.' </p>

<p>'What's the big deal?' she asked, while clarifying she wants to wear underwear that stretches over her belly, feels good and is soft. 'If you don't like it, don't wear it.' </p>

<p>She reiterated that maternity solutionwear isn't designed to hide pregnancy chuckled at the idea that pregnant women would think the garments would make them look 'smaller.'</p>

<p>Mixed reception: Kim Kardashian, 39, unveiled a new line of Skims maternity shapewear on Saturday, but some social media users were upset by the clothing</p>

<p>'It feels easier to get up,' the cookbook author said, before noting she is 'one thousand percent not trying' to make herself 'smaller.   </p>

<p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star first shared the news of her new line on Instagram with an array of pregnant women in different styles and shades of her product.  </p>

<p>'What you’ve been waiting for: <?php echo e('@'); ?>SKIMS Maternity is coming soon! Introducing Maternity Solutionwear™ that offers the best in comfort and support for your changing body during and after pregnancy,' Kim captioned the ad. </p>

<p>Coming soon: Kim noted the maternity line would be available on Wednesday, September 16, and would come in nine different colors; pictured in November 2019 in Santa Monica</p>

<p>Her Skims Instagram account also featured some closeups of the pregnancy clothing, with models caressing their baby bumps. </p>

<p>In addition to a one-piece set, the look also came with separate bras and full-length leggings or shorts.   </p>

<p>Closer look: Her Skims Instagram account also featured some closeups of the pregnancy clothing, with models caressing their baby bumps</p>

<p>Some of the clothing advertised was functional, including the Maternity Nursing Sculpting Bra with easy-to-open clasps to make it easier to nurse.</p>

<p>Crucially, all of the maternity bodysuits advertised 'non-compressive cores,' so as not to apply pressure on the stomach. </p>

<p>In her Insta Stories, Kim showed off the new clothing and revealed that the new Skims still had 'butt-shaping' designs, but that a thinner fabric was used over the midriff 'so it’s not compressing on your stomach which is really important because you obviously don’t want to do that.'  </p>

<p>'But you want to shape everything else around it,' she said.</p>

<p>'If only there were cute bras like this that were holding you up and snatching you and making you feel better about yourself while you can breastfeed — that would have been everything to me,' Kim continued while perusing her items. 'I never wore a maternity bra because there was nothing out there, so this was really important to me.' </p>

<p>Despite those practicalities, many social media users questioned why pregnant women needed to be sculpting their physiques at all. </p>

<p>Unnecessary: Another person offered a more sarcastic take: 'I'm sure that's the one thing pregnant women need above all! Being pressed to a slimmer figure'</p>

<p>'.... shape wear for pregnant bodies... what the f*** is this???' wrote one outraged Twitter user.</p>

<p>Another person offered a more sarcastic take: 'I'm sure that's the one thing pregnant women need above all! Being pressed to a slimmer figure.' </p>

<p>But plenty of others seemed excited about the new development, with one person admitting, 'I'm getting this and I'm not even pregnant.'</p>

<p>In fact, users have been commenting on Kim's past Skims-related posts throughout recent months asking if a maternity line would be forthcoming, and multiple pregant women had expressed disappointment that they didn't have the same options available to them.</p>

<p>Not a fan: Despite those practicalities, many social media users questioned why pregnant women needed to be sculpting their physiques at all</p>

<p>Kim's new items arrive following news that her long-running series Keeping Up With The Kardashians will be coming to an end it 2021 with its 20th season, which just began filming.</p>

<p>Page Six reported Saturday that the decision to pull the plug came from Kris Jenner, after both Kim and her younger sister Kylie Jenner expressed a desire to leave the show.</p>
