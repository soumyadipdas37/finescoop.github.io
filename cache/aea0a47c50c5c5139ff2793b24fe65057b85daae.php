<p>Manchester United remain interested in signing RB Leipzig centre-back Dayot Upamecano</p>

<p>Leipzig are determined to keep Upamecano, who signed a new contract in July that runs until the summer of 2023.</p>

<p>Chris Smalling is eager to play regularly after impressing on loan at Roma and could depart United permanently.</p>

<p>Solskjaer deployed a centre-back pairing of Victor Lindelof and Harry Maguire for the defeat to Palace, with Eric Bailly on the bench.</p>

<p>Axel Tuanzebe, meanwhile, isn't yet fully fit, but will hope to be involved in some capacity when he is back available. </p>

<p>Upamecano has frequently impressed for Leipzig, and, at the age of 21, has much time on his side to improve even further.  </p>
