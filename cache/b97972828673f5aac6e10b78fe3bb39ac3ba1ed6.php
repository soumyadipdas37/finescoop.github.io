<p>However, Amanza's sleeveless gown – a deeply plunging purple and bikini number with spaghetti straps, a thigh-scraping hemline and back cut-outs – drew criticism.</p>

<p>While some fans questioned whether the dress was appropriate, one went for the jugular, commenting to Mary: 'Your friend really went into her closet and was like "this stripper dress will be perfect for the office today!"'</p>

<p>Immediately clapping back, mother-of-two Amanza responded: '[W]ell well we'll aren't you a feisty and judgmental one? Big hug and God bless!' [sic]</p>

<p>Clapping back: While some fans questioned whether the dress was appropriate, one went for the jugular, prompting mother-of-two Amanza to immediately clap back</p>

<p>However, it appears that the dress in question may have been worn on the way to – or from an event – as she was seen in the same gown while attending Debbie Durkin's ECOLUXE Drive-Thru Endless Summer Festival at The Beverly Hilton that day.</p>

<p>Amanza's social media showdown comes after she revealed that she is back in touch with The Script's Danny O'Donoghue following their past whirlwind romance. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, the real estate agent revealed she had enjoyed a short-lived 'rebound' relationship with the Irish musician, 39, following her divorce from NFL star Ralph Brown, 41. </p>

<p>Discussing their past romance on ITV's This Morning, Amanza admitted she was back in touch with Danny after contacting him on Instagram where they 'had a laugh'.   </p>

<p>Stepping out: However, it appears that the dress in question may have been worn on the way to – or from an event – as she was seen in the same gown in Beverly Hills that day</p>

<p>The reality star, who has two children Braker, eight, and Noah, 10, also admitted she was 'naive' to 'leak' news of their past relationship in the first place. </p>

<p>Amanza was joined by co-stars and best friends, Jason Oppenheim and Mary Fitzgerald, for the interview with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby. </p>

<p>The former model said: 'I was a bit naive... I did my first Irish press and I thought that would be a cute story. Months later now, it's followed me.</p>

<p>'I actually spoke to Danny a couple of days ago on Instagram, I let him know, "I don't know if you've seen this, but I just thought you should know I sort of leaked this to the press in your neck of the woods." </p>

<p>Whirlwind! Last week, the Selling Sunset star revealed she is back in touch with The Script's Danny O'Donoghue following their past whirlwind romance </p>

<p>'We had a laugh, he was like, "It's all good, you gave me a 10/10, so..."' </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Amanza shared news of her past romance with Danny on Irish programme, Six O'Clock Show, with Muireann O'Connell and Martin King.</p>

<p>She said: 'I had a whirlwind romance with one of your people right after my divorce I think. I was going through it, it was a rebound but no we had a lot of fun together actually.</p>

<p>'It was short lived because we live across the pond from one another and it was the first person I actually dated right after my divorce.</p>

<p>Rebound! Earlier this month, the real estate agent, 43, revealed she had enjoyed a short-lived 'rebound' relationship with the Irish musician, 39 (pictured in September 2019)</p>

<p>'So this was a long time ago, this was like eight years ago but he's an awesome guy and we had a lot of fun.'</p>

<p>She added: 'Look we had an amazing time, I thought I was in love and it ended about as quickly as it started. But I mean we would still be friends.</p>

<p>'Once in a blue moon he'll pop his head in and say, "What's up?" and you know ask how we're doing, ask how the kiddos are and stuff. </p>

<p>'Yeah he's good, I'd give him a ten. You're welcome Danny.'</p>

<p>Back in touch: Discussing their past romance on Tuesday's This Morning, Amanza, admitted she was back in touch with Danny after contacting him on Instagram  </p>

<p>On series two and three of Selling Sunset, Amanza shared glimpses into her life as a single mother.</p>

<p>During the show, her ex Ralph went 'off the grid' and she applied for full custody of their children – Braker, eight, and Noah, 10.</p>

<p>Revealing why she chose to document that on the hit Netflix series, Amanza said: 'When I signed on to do Selling Sunset season two, my life was very different.</p>

<p>'The children's father was still very present in our lives, that wasn't the situation until less than a month into filming season two that all switched, so through filming season two you kind of see my fumbling a little bit through a hard time. </p>

<p>Co-stars: The former model was joined by co-stars and best friends, Jason Oppenheim and Mary Fitzgerald, for the interview with Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby  </p>

<p>'After filming for several months and the situation hadn't changed it. I didn't know that was going to be the situation and I had to share that with the audience, otherwise I look like a bit flighty, late.</p>

<p>'It made sense to me to open up to the show and everybody to what I was dealing with behind-the-scenes. It was a natural thing, it wasn't like I made the decision, "Oh, let me share this with the world."'</p>

<p>Amanza also discussed being the 'new girl' in the office despite calling twins Jason and Brett, who run The Oppenheim Group, which sells multimillion dollar properties to the rich and famous of Los Angeles, and Mary her best friends.  </p>

<p>She said: 'I'm not really the new girl I'm the oldest in the office, and I've known Mary, Jason and Brett for about 19 years so I'm definitely the newest agent, but not at all the newest member of the family.'</p>

<p>Chat: Speaking of their recent chat, Amanza said, 'I actually spoke to Danny a couple of days ago on Instagram, I let him know [she had revealed their past fling]. We had a laugh'</p>
