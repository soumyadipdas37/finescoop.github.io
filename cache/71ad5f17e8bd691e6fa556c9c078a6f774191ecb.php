<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have held further discussions over a deal for Porto left back Alex Telles but there is no agreement in place. </p>

<p>The 27-year old Brazilian would cost around £17million and provide competition for Luke Shaw.</p>

<p>Manchester United could be set to land their second signing of the summer in Alex Telles</p>

<p>The Premier League side have held talks with Porto over a move for the 27-year-old</p>

<p>United had held discussions with Real Madrid over Sergio Reguilon prior to his move to Tottenham but were not prepared to agree to buy back clauses. United are continuing to pursue right wing options also.</p>

<p>Inter Milan’s Ivan Perisic is among those to have been discussed though Watford’s £40m-rated Ismaila Sarr is not considered a target.</p>

<p>Roma remain hopeful of reaching agreement with United for defender Chris Smalling.</p>

<p>Roma manager Paulo Fonseca confirmed: ‘I am in regular contact with Chris Smalling, I spoke to him yesterday.</p>

<p>'He wants to come back to Roma and we want to have him back. I think that there could be an update over the next few days.’ </p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to strengthen his full-back options before transfer deadline day</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was asked about potential signings during his pre-match press-conference ahead of their season opener against Crystal Palace on Saturday. </p>

<p>He said: 'We understand to get further we need to develop what we have and strengthen the team, but let's wait and see if we manage to bring anyone in.</p>

<p>'I've been in dialogue with the club. We're always discussing. We want to take a step forward and we can go into the new season with confidence, but we're looking to give the group a boost and we're working on it.' </p>

<p>ESPN reported that Manchester United's hierarchy have become frustrated with growing concerns on social media about the club's lack of transfer activity, with calls for new signings believed to be causing negativity. </p>

<p>United were reported to be interested in Sergio Reguilon who is now set to join Tottenham</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have been involved in a prolonged saga to sign Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho, yet have not made headway in securing a deal for the England international. </p>

<p>And this week the Red Devils have seen Real Madrid duo Reguilon and Gareth Bale snatched away from them, with Tottenham set to announce the pair. </p>

<p>United chiefs believe that the whirlwind of negative social media feedback from fans could have a drastic impact on the team, who are set to face Crystal Palace in their Premier League opener this weekend.</p>
