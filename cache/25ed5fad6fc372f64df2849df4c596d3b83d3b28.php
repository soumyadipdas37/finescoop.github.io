<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brighton are weighing up whether to loan out one of their next highly-rated academy prospects Max Sanders after he starred on his full debut.</p>

<p>England under-19 midfielder Sanders stole the show on his first start for the Seagulls in their 2-0 Carabao Cup win at Preston on Wednesday night to help set up a fourth round clash with Manchester United.</p>

<p>Sanders, 21, got his first taste of senior football last season when he made 22 appearances while on loan at AFC Wimbledon in League One.</p>

<p>Brighton are considering sending young midfielder Max Sanders out on loan this season</p>

<p>He is keen to gain more experience by playing regularly and Brighton, who have high hopes for Sanders, are considering the next best move for his development.</p>

<p>A number of Championship clubs have enquired about taking him on loan.</p>

<p>There is a strong academy presence in Graham Potter’s Premier League side with Lewis Dunk, Ben White, Solly March and Aaron Connolly all emerging from their youth ranks.</p>

<p>More have featured in the Carabao Cup including Sanders, a technical all-round central midfielder who is good on the ball, possesses a wide passing range and is comfortable in either a disciplined holding or box-to-box role.</p>

<p>Sanders stole the show in Brighton's Carabao Cup win over Preston on Wednesday night</p>

<p>Potter is not short of central midfielders, even after letting Aaron Mooy and Dale Stephens leave permanently during this window.</p>

<p>That may make another loan move for Sanders the ideal solution though one stumbling block is that he is now into the last year of his contract and would be a free agent once any temporary switch is over. Brighton have an option to extend Sanders’ deal by a further year.</p>

<p>Sanders, who joined Brighton aged eight and made his debut as a sub in the previous round against Portsmouth, shone against Preston, completing 91 per cent of his passes.</p>

<p>Potter said: ‘It’s not an easy position [central midfield]. He played with responsibility, getting on the ball, having courage to get it under pressure and did his defensive work well.’ </p>
