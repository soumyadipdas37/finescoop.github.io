<p>Brandon Jones, 22, who lives in Telford, Shropshire, has blasted KFC for serving him an 'uncooked' Zinger burger (pictured)</p>

<p>Brandon, who purchased a KFC Zinger burger yesterday evening, said he tried to raise concerns about his takeaway at the restaurant that he ordered from but a manger said they couldn't help.  </p>

<p>He explained: 'After eating half of the zinger burger (in the dark), I realised the chicken was more crunchy than usual, so I turned my light on.</p>

<p>'To my surprise, the chicken was uncooked and completely pink. It instantly made me physically sick.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'I contacted KFC via phone and the manager told me they can't do anything without seeing the food.</p>

<p>Brandon (pictured) said he had eaten half of his meal in the dark, when he turned on the light to see why it tasted 'more crunchy than usual' </p>

<p>Brandon claims staff at the store he purchased his takeaway (pictured) refused to resolve the situation and he has had difficulties contacting a representative by phone </p>

<p>'I drove down and showed it to one of their staff members, and the manager and they were completely shocked.</p>

<p>'The manager said they can't deal with it there so she gave me a number for the '"customer care team".'</p>

<p>He continued: 'The number didn't even work, she gave me an old number, so I took it upon myself to use their live chat function.</p>

<p>'I was then told it has to be dealt with by the senior care team and they're email only.'</p>

<p>Brandon claimed KFC provided the wrong information to make a complaint more than once and almost 24 hours since his purchase, the issue still hasn't be resolved. </p>

<p>Brandon's complaint follows KFC's recent decision to pause use of their classic Finger Lickin' Good slogan. Pictured: The Zinger Stacker burger</p>

<p>He explained: 'They gave me an incorrect email due to a 'typo' after waiting to chat to someone for an hour on live chat.</p>

<p>'I finally emailed the care team direct and I'm currently awaiting a reply from them.'</p>

<p>The complaint comes a month after KFC made a statement announcing they will temporarily stop using their classic Finger Lickin' Good slogan after 64 years amid the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>The restaurant chain have now reopened the majority of their stores with additional health and safety policies in place, following their closure during the lockdown in March.</p>
