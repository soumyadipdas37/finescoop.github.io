<p>Renovation upset: The Block's Jasmin was left furious and devastated during Wednesday's episode, when the walk-in wardrobe she was renovating didn't turn out as she'd hoped. Pictured with husband Luke</p>

<p>After showing hosts Scott Cam and Shelley Craft the newly renovated wardrobe, Jasmin admitted she was unsure about the design.</p>

<p>Placing the blame squarely on the company that was outfitting the walk-in, Jasmin said she wanted doors in the wardrobe but was told 'it wasn't high-end and luxe'.</p>

<p>'Oh,' responded a disappointed Shelley, 44, before admitting she wasn't loving the white shelving either.</p>

<p>Meltdown: The 36-year-old's husband Luke was forced to console her, after she broke down in tears and stormed off the site</p>

<p>Not happy: Jasmin argued that the company tasked with outfitting the wardrobe had somehow coerced her into a design she didn't want</p>

<p>Added Jasmin: 'We did say that. We also said that.'</p>

<p>While Luke, 35, was confident the walk-in wardrobe could still be salvaged, Jasmin wasn't so sure, and broke down.</p>

<p>'I f<strong>king hate it,' shrugged Jasmin, before walking off and tearfully adding, 'I'm so p</strong>sed off with those f**king robes.'</p>

<p>Not what she ordered: After showing hosts Scott Cam and Shelley Craft (both pictured left) the newly renovated wardrobe, Jasmin admitted she was unsure about the design</p>

<p>Honest opinion: Shelley confessed she was disappointed about the lack of doors, before admitting she wasn't loving the white shelving either</p>

<p>But later in the episode, Scott, 57, confronted Jasmin and told her he'd listened to the conversation she'd had with the outfitters, and she had ultimately chosen both the design and colour.</p>

<p>After complaining about the lack of a mirror in the walk-in, Scott told Jasmin that when the outfitter wanted to meet with her to discuss mirrors, she'd told him she didn't have time.</p>

<p>'I just listened to the audio 10 minutes ago. Exactly what you asked for,' Scott told her, with Jasmin finally relenting. </p>

<p>Taking responsibility: Later in the episode, Scott, 57, confronted Jasmin and told her he'd listened to the conversation she'd had with the outfitters, and she had ultimately chosen both the design and colour</p>
