<p>A genetic quirk inherited from the extinct human species, who lived 40,000 to 400,000 years ago, could make people more susceptible to Covid-19.</p>

<p>This genetic variation is present in modern-day humans because our ancestors had sex with Neanderthals about 60,000 years ago, researchers say.</p>

<p>And those who have the variant are up to three times more likely to need ventilation if they catch the virus.</p>

<p>In a study of 3,199 hospital patients with coronavirus in Italy and Spain, researchers found the genetic signature was linked to a more severe illness.</p>

<p>Lead author Professor Hugo Zeberg, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, said: ‘The increase in risk is 60-70 per cent if you carry one copy of the Neanderthal variant and three times the risk if you have two copies - one from your father and one from your mother.</p>

<p>People infected with Covid-19 who carry a specific snippet of genetic coding bequeathed by Neanderthals are three times more likely to need mechanical ventilation</p>

<p>‘Later studies estimate the risk increase to be even higher, with twice the risk if you have one copy and up to a five-fold increase if you have two copies.’ It is not yet known why the Neanderthal gene is associated with an increased risk of becoming severely ill, while scientists say it is something to be investigated ‘as quickly as possible’.</p>

<p>Not everyone has this variant - they are most common among people of South Asian ethnicity, of whom around 50 per cent have it.</p>

<p>It is less common in Europe, where about 16 per cent of people carry it.</p>

<p>Bangladesh has the highest number of carriers at 63 per cent.</p>

<p>The researchers wanted to know whether the quirk had been passed over from Neanderthals or whether it had been inherited by both Neanderthals and present-day people through a common ancestor.</p>

<p>They concluded it must have come from inbreeding between Neanderthals and present-day humans because the last common ancestor between the groups would have lived 550,000 years ago - during which time the genetic variant probably would have been altered.</p>

<p>Author Professor Svante Paabo, from the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, said: ‘It is striking that the genetic heritage from Neanderthals has such tragic consequences during the current pandemic.’ The scientists are keen to point out that there are also other factors that can influence a person’s susceptibility to having a severe reaction to the virus, including their age and the existence of other medical conditions.</p>

<p>Prof Zeberg, said: ‘Obviously, factors such as your age and other diseases you may have also affect how severely you are affected by the virus.</p>

<p>‘But among genetic factors, this is the strongest one.’ </p>
