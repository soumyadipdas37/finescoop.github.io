<p>The 73-year-old was found guilty in the NSW Supreme Court in July of 20 offences relating to six Sydney events between February 1980 and July 1985.</p>

<p>WarwickÂ also was found to have bombed Justice Richard Gee's home with intent to murder him as well as bombing the court building at Parramatta</p>

<p>Justice Peter Garling, who heard the long-running trial without a jury, on Thursday imposed three life sentences on the former firefighter, finding the criminality involved was of the highest level for each murder.</p>

<p>'The conduct of the offender was calculated, violent and hateful,' he said.</p>

<p>The judge also described the crimes as 'evil' and attacks on Australian democracy.</p>

<p>The so-called Family Court bomber waged a campaign of extreme violence against those he believed acted adversely towards him in his drawn-out dispute with his ex-wife Andrea Blanchard.</p>

<p>As well as the three murders, Warwick also was found to have bombed Justice Richard Gee's home with intent to murder him, bombed the court building at Parramatta and placed a car bomb at the previous home of Ms Blanchard's solicitor.</p>

<p>Justice Opas was shot dead when he answered the doorbell just as his family sat down to dinner.</p>

<p>Pearl Watson was saying goodbye to her husband when a bomb exploded at their front door.</p>

<p>Graham Wykes died and 13 people were seriously injured when a bomb ripped apart the Jehovah's Witnesses hall. Congregation members had offered support to Warwick's ex-wife.</p>
