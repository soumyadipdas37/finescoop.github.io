<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fraud fight: Ian Dyson of the City of London Police</p>

<p>Fraud used to be seen as a 'victimless' crime. Make no mistake, at the City of London Police we have never agreed with that narrative. </p>

<p>And public opinion is now recognising the emotional - as well as financial - harm caused by this most prevalent of crimes.</p>

<p>The sad fact is that you are more likely to be the victim of fraud than any other type of crime. </p>

<p>And while the internet has brought a wealth of opportunities, it has also allowed fraud to flourish: the criminal can target people nationally and internationally, yet never have to look a victim in the eye.</p>

<p>Proceeds are then used to fund serious and organised crime gangs, allowing them to finance the sale of drugs, weapons and modern slavery.</p>

<p>City of London Police is policing's National Lead Force for fraud. We work closely with partners and other law-enforcement agencies to provide a linked-up response to tackle it. </p>

<p>We host the national reporting centre, Action Fraud, which receives reports of fraud and cyber crime. </p>

<p>And we run the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB), responsible for assessing these reports, linking similar ones and identifying viable lines of inquiry for police forces to investigate.</p>

<p>With more than 320,000 frauds reported to Action Fraud last year, police forces can't investigate every one. But all reports matter in helping us to spot complex patterns.</p>

<p>In the first few months of the Covid-19 pandemic, there were more than 2,500 reports to Action Fraud and losses exceeded £8 million, mostly in online fraud. </p>

<p>We were able to identify more than 1,700 fraudulent telephone numbers, websites and email addresses that we could disrupt, saving many more people from becoming victims.</p>

<p>Working with the National Crime Agency and other police forces, City of London Police co-ordinated an operation on courier fraud at the beginning of the year, which has resulted in 100 arrests.</p>

<p>Anyone can be a victim of fraud, and no one should feel too embarrassed to report it; scams can be sophisticated and convincing.</p>

<p>If you receive an unsolicited call, email or text message, stop and think. Are you being asked for personal information or financial details? </p>

<p>If so, don't respond. Only a criminal will try to rush you into making a decision.</p>

<p>And if you do fall victim please report it to Action Fraud (0300 123 2040 or action fraud.police.uk).</p>
