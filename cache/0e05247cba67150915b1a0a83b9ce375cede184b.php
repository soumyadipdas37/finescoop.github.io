<p>Stunning: Hayley Roberts turned heads in her own right as she stepped out in a flesh-flashing ensemble to pick up groceries at Bristol Farms in Calabasas</p>

<p>Offering a look at her sculpted stomach, the pretty blonde slipped into a neon yellow sports bra with cross strap detailing. </p>

<p>She teamed the garment with denim hotpants that highlighted her tanned and toned pins, whilst a pair of pink Vans injected another splash of colour. </p>

<p>Hayley completed the look with a black Under Armour cap and blue surgical face mask.  </p>

<p>Looking good: The former shop assistant, 40, put her tanned and toned figure on display as she headed out with her bodyguard</p>

<p>Although Hayley clearly keeps fit, her husband David recently admitted she struggles to keep up with him in the gym - despite being 27 years his junior.</p>

<p>The Hoff, 68, told Metro earlier this year, 'my wife goes, "You’re crazy, you work out so much." </p>

<p>'But I pride myself on my appearance and if I look in the mirror and I see a roll of fat, I immediately do something about it. I want to put on a good show and if I look good, I feel good.'</p>

<p>Hayley and David have been married since 2018, when they had a romantic and lavish ceremony in Puglia, Italy.</p>

<p>They met back in 2011, when Hasselhoff was working as a judge on Britain's Got Talent. </p>

<p>While in Cardiff, Wales for auditions, the former Baywatch star strolled into a store and was approached for a picture by Hayley, who was working as a shop assistant at the time. </p>

<p>The former Knight Rider star has two daughters from his marriage to second wife Pamela Bach: Taylor Ann Hasselhoff, 30, and Hayley Hasselhoff, 27. </p>

<p>Fit couple: Although Hayley clearly keeps fit, her husband David recently admitted she struggles to keep up with him in the gym - despite being 27 years his junior</p>
