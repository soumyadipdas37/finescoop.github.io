<p>It's over: Love Island's Laura Anderson has split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom Brazier just days after moving back to Scotland</p>

<p>Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.' </p>

<p>Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat. </p>

<p>Going solo: Despite initially intending for hunky Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off</p>

<p>Sad news: Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday as she insisted she has nothing but 'love' to her ex </p>

<p>Laura had originally enthused about her new life in Scotland with Tom who she got together with during lockdown after meeting him in January whilst walking her dog.</p>

<p>The two even went on holiday to Dubai together and hit the headlines when they were mugged in Barcelona, before Laura also introduced Tom to her family in Scotland.</p>

<p>She'd enthused about him saying: 'We live in the same complex and we used to stop to say hi when we took our dogs to the park. I needed a new PT so I approached him. </p>

<p>'Then one night, six weeks into my training, one thing led to another. He had no clue I had been on Love Island.'</p>

<p>Back home: Back in April, Laura revealed she would be moving back to Scotland permanently after lockdown is over, due to feeling lonely in the English capital</p>

<p>Laura who moved to the swanky Park Circus area of Glasgow last week said she had fully hoped Tom would join her in her new home.</p>

<p>She had gushed that she'd never met anyone like him before adding: 'I'm still going to move to Scotland and Tom is looking to follow me up in the next six months. He's the cherry on top of the cake.'</p>

<p>Now that the romance is off, Laura admitted she is looking for a new fitness coach.</p>

<p>She asked fellow Scot and Love Island Star Anton Danyluk if he would train her now she's back, telling him: 'I'm still waiting for you to train me now I'm back FYI. Where's a good gym?'  </p>

<p>New love: Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat</p>

<p>Laura first rose to fame for her appearance on the 2018 edition of Love Island, where she embarked on ill-fated relationships with Wes Nelson and Paul Knops.</p>

<p>After leaving the villa, the bombshell dated series one winner Max Morley in October.</p>

<p>The duo were in an on-off relationship, with the stars splitting in December, reuniting in May 2019, and eventually calling it quits for good in July last year.</p>

<p>Back in April, Laura revealed she would be moving back to Scotland permanently after lockdown is over, due to feeling lonely in the English capital.</p>

<p>Speaking to Vas J Morgan for his I AM ENOUGH podcast last month, Laura said she had made some big decisions during the lockdown period and told the former TOWIE star: 'I have decided to move to Scotland because I want to buy a flat.</p>

<p>'I just moved here after Love Island and obviously its been almost two years now.</p>

<p>'I just think I want to go back and live with my family and friends that I have had for years, get a bit of support with the dog if I need to go and do something and try and buy a place.</p>

<p>'I have been renting my whole life, wasting all my money and I just think it is so expensive in London and I'm quite lonely here, I don't know that many people.</p>

<p>'I've always wanted to wait to meet a guy and buy a house and I think 'no I want to buy a flat myself'.</p>

<p>'It might not be the most amazing thing and I'm sure it will take me like 20 million years to pay off but that is what I want to do so that is really getting me through this [lockdown].</p>

<p>'I am enjoying being here because I know it is not going to be that long.'</p>
