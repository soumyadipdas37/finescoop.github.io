<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jamie Carragher says that if Manchester United don't sign Jadon Sancho this summer they risk losing him to Liverpool next year.</p>

<p>And the former Champions League winner with Liverpool says that signing Sancho is crucial if United wish to close the gap on Liverpool and Manchester City and move closer to challenging for the title.</p>

<p>'I think United will eventually pay what they need to pay to sign Sancho because they are one of maybe two teams in the Premier League who still have the finances to spend big after the pandemic,' said Carragher.</p>

<p>Jadon Sancho has been the subject of heavy interest all summer from Manchester United</p>

<p>'United have almost got a clear run at Sancho now but that will change if he's still at Dortmund next year. I'd be very surprised if Liverpool didn't try to sign him next summer. I don't think City will want him because of the way he left but Chelsea might think about it.</p>

<p>'United need someone on that right-hand side. Mason Greenwood has come in and done brilliantly, but I think he will eventually play down the middle. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has tried Marcus Rashford, Dan James and even Juan Mata in that role, now it's Greenwood.</p>

<p>'I think United also need a centre-back. But the fact that Chelsea have signed Thiago Silva tells you there aren't many great central defenders out there. Unless United get a couple more, I can't see how they will challenge City and Liverpool at the top. You need a minimum of 95 points now – and I only think City and Liverpool can get that kind of total.</p>

<p>'Roy Keane shot me down last year when we were speaking about United and I said; "You're never as bad as you think." I've always thought that one or two little things can turn it. And signing Bruno Fernandes in January has completely changed Manchester United. That's just one signing. He came in and suddenly United were a completely different team.</p>

<p>'That's how close it is. It could be that Jadon Sancho comes in and suddenly Man United are challenging for the title. I don't think United are as far away as people think. One or two more signings could make that difference.'</p>

<p>Jamie Carragher believes Liverpool could sign him next summer if United miss out now</p>

<p>Sly Sports pundit Carragher has some sympathy for United's executive chairman Ed Woodward, who has been refusing to pay the £108m expected for the 20 year old England star. 'When Man United have paid big fees for players in the past we all laugh and say: "They've been done again."</p>

<p>'People call Ed Woodward a joke because selling clubs can get an extra £10million or £20million from him. Now Borussia Dortmund have asked £108million for Jadon Sancho and because United haven't paid it straight away everyone is criticising them again.</p>

<p>'Ed Woodward is damned if he does and damned if he doesn't. He can't really win. I've been there for Liverpool. We'd be interested in a player and I'd be saying: "Just pay it." Then, a few months later, when the player is struggling, you're asking: "Why did we pay so much for him?"</p>

<p>'So I understand that United are in a difficult situation. If Liverpool don't sign Thiago, I don't think Liverpool fans will criticise the club because Jurgen Klopp has built a successful team. But United haven't got that. Their fans will want them to pay the money and get the deals done.'</p>
