<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jurgen Klopp has admitted he is itching to finally meet and speak with Marcelo Bielsa ahead of Liverpool's season opener on Saturday, though joked that language may be an issue.</p>

<p>The German manager will come up against last season's winner of the Championship, and wishes to compare notes with Bielsa providing his limited Spanish skills allow him to do so.</p>

<p>Speaking to Football Daily, Klopp made light of the situation and explained that his Spanish went as far as ordering a beer on holiday, before waxing lyrical about Bielsa's style and ideas. </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp is itching to meet Marcelo Bielsa but has joked about language obstacles</p>

<p>The enigmatic Argentine will bring a unique and meticulous brand of football to the top flight</p>

<p>'My Spanish is pretty random, I'd love to have a conversation with him which would be nice, but I don't speak Spanish apart from ordering a beer and I don't know how his English is meanwhile,' said the Liverpool boss.</p>

<p>'So that's a bit of a shame but apart from that I just couldn't have more respect for what he is doing to be honest.</p>

<p>Bielsa has breathed life into Leeds, and has influenced the likes of Pep Guardiola in his career</p>

<p>'What a guy. The team, the style, how they play will suit them even more for the Premier League than for the Championship one hundred percent. </p>

<p>'They can be and will be very very uncomfortable to play against.' </p>

<p>Both teams face off in Saturday's late kick-off, with the action commencing in an empty Anfield at 5.30pm.</p>

<p>It has been 17 years since the two teams last faced in a Premier League clash on Merseyside, in a clash which saw Liverpool triumph 3-1.</p>

<p>The two sides, who each won the league last season, will meet in an empty Anfield at 5.30pm</p>

<p>Michael Owen and Danny Murphy were among the goals for the hosts, before local Leeds hero Alan Smith grabbed one back for his side.</p>

<p>Florent Sinama Pongolle scored a late tap-in winner, to give three points to his side and add further misery to a crumbling season for Leeds, which ultimately resulted in relegation. </p>
