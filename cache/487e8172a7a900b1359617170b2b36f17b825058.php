<p>Together again: Vicky Entwistle, 52, and Bruce Jones, 67, had a tearful reunion on Loose Women as they saw each other for the first time in several years</p>

<p>Bruce replied: 'So do you, you look absolutely beautiful, you've never changed. I'm nearly in tears looking at you, the memories are flooding back.'</p>

<p>Vicky tearfully replied: 'I promised to myself I wouldn't cry – sorry!'</p>

<p>Bruce admitted: 'I owe Vicky so much. Thank you very much Vicky. I'm back, I'm top form!'</p>

<p>Explaining their on-screen bond, Bruce said: 'The first day we met, we gelled. It was such a great thing for me to have an actress of Vicky's standard. We just gelled and became The Battersbys.</p>

<p>Emotional: The actors, who played Janice and Les Battersby on Coronation Street, were close friends during their time on the soap and both were thrilled to see each other again</p>

<p>'The pair of us were scared at first. When we read the first scripts, I thought we’re never going to get away with this, we’re going to be hated. </p>

<p>'But we did it. We worked hard and we did it. Vicky got me through quite a lot of it. I just wanted to be an actor.</p>

<p>'The first two years we were hated...I think I even got told off by my mum. She told me if I did anything against Mr Ken Barlow, that nice man, don’t come home!'</p>

<p>Explaining why she had become emotional, Vicky said: 'I think just seeing his little face. We did have some great laughs. </p>

<p>Fan favourites: Bruce and Vicky joined Coronation Street in 1997, with Bruce leaving 10 years later and Vicky departing the soap in 2011 (pictured in 1999)</p>

<p>Reunited: Becoming emotional, Vicki said: '[It's been] years [since we've seen each other] – four years, maybe five. You look gorgeous still!' (pictured in 1997)</p>

<p>'We used to get told off like you wouldn’t believe. They’d say "cut" and we’d be laughing our heads off over what we had to say or do – it was really outrageous. We were like, "We’re going to ruin this programme!" </p>

<p>'We’d both separately been watching it for years. Then all of a sudden, he’s got to headbutt Curly and I’ve got to shout at everyone. We’re like, "No one’s going to like us!"  And to be honest, I don’t think they did!'</p>

<p>Asked if they’d consider a return, Vicky said: 'If they gave us the Rovers, Bruce, what do you think? Would you be up for running that with me?'</p>

<p>Bruce replied: 'So do you, you look absolutely beautiful, you've never changed. I'm nearly in tears looking at you, the memories are flooding back' (pictured in 2001) </p>

<p>Bruce added: 'I would. But I’d only go back with you'.</p>

<p>Vicky replied: 'Yeah, I don’t want you to go back with anyone else!'</p>

<p>Bruce and Vicky joined Coronation Street in 1997, with Bruce leaving 10 years later and Vicky departing the soap in 2011. </p>
