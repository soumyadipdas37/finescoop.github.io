<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Don't kiss and consider wearing a mask when having sex to protect yourself from catching the coronavirus, Canada's top physician said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>In a statement, Dr Theresa Tam, the country's Chief Public Health Officer, said there is little chance of contracting COVID-19 from semen or vaginal fluid.  </p>

<p>However, sexual activity with new partners does increase the risk of falling ill with the virus, particularly if there is close contact.</p>

<p>'Like other activities during COVID-19 that involve physical closeness, there are some things you can do to minimize the risk of getting infected and spreading the virus,' Tam said.  </p>

<p>Dr Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, recommends no kissing and wearing a mask to prevent the spread of respiratory droplets. Pictured: Tam speaks during a news conference on the COVID-19 pandemic on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, August 21</p>

<p>Tam also suggests monitoring yourself and your partner for symptoms and being aware if your partner is at high risk of contracting COVID-19 (file image)</p>

<p>While 'the lowest risk sexual activity during COVID-19 involves yourself alone' there are steps people can take to stay safe.</p>

<p>Tam says the most important step is to make sure people have a trusting relationship with their sexual partners.  </p>

<p>She says risk can be reduced by wearing a mask that covers the mouth and nose, avoiding face-to-face closeness and no kissing.</p>

<p>This is because the virus spreads via respiratory droplets, which can be inhaled or land in the nose and mouth.</p>

<p>Additionally, the virus can land on skin and personal belongings, which a person can come into contact with and then touch his or her mouth, nose or eyes.</p>

<p>People should also monitor themselves and their partners for symptoms ahead of any sexual activity and be aware if their partners is at high-risk of catching COVID-10, Tam said.</p>

<p>This includes having underlying conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity or being immunocompromised.</p>

<p>Tam also suggests limiting the use of alcohol or other substances that lead to unsafe decisions being made around sex. </p>

<p>'Sexual health is an important part of our overall health,' she said.  </p>

<p>'However, sex can be complicated in the time of COVID-19, especially for those without an intimate partner in their household or whose sexual partner is at higher risk for COVID-19.'</p>

<p>But by taking precautions, 'Canadians can find ways to enjoy physical intimacy while safeguarding the progress we have all made containing COVID-19."' </p>

<p>DailyMail.com has reached out to the Public Health Agency for comment. </p>

<p>Canada has reported more than 129,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 9,100 deaths.</p>

<p>New daily cases are far below peak volumes, but there has been a recent uptick, driven by more infections in certain western Canadian provinces. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the US, there are more than 6.1 million confirmed cases of the virus and more than 184,000 deaths. </p>

<p>The governments of Canada, the US and Mexico have closed their borders to all non-essential travel since March. It's been extended for at least one more month until September 21.</p>
