<p>At Tuesday's appearance, Laidley donned long, bright orange acrylic fingernails and sipped from a mug bearing the words 'Don't Worry Be Happy', the Herald Sun reported. </p>

<p>The former North Melbourne coach's lawyer said Laidley had completed his treatment program at the clinic, and would continue treatment as an outpatient. </p>

<p>Laidley, who began his AFL playing career with West Coast and was part of North Melbourne's 1996 premiership team, was charged with a series of offences in May including stalking and committing an indictable offence while on bail.</p>

<p>Police allege they found 0.43 grams of methamphetamine hidden in his bra. </p>

<p>He was on police bail at the time after being charged on summons with ice possession. </p>

<p>The former West Coast Eagles star was also charged with a persistent breach of a family violence order, using a carriage service to menace and four other intervention order breaches.     </p>

<p>Laidley spent over a month in a Geelong rehabilitation clinic after his arrest and was then moved to a transitional housing facility. </p>

<p>Victoria's corruption watchdog, the independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission, launched an investigation into the leaking of the photos.      </p>

<p>Police Commissioner Shane Patton warned the leak was 'unacceptable'. </p>

<p>'I am appalled an employee of Victoria Police has taken these photographs.</p>

<p>'It is appalling conduct and there is no place for it in our ­organisation,' he said.  </p>

<p>Around 100 police employees have reportedly come forward about receiving the photos and the officers in question could face dismissal and criminal charges.</p>

<p>Laidley will return to court to face the charges on Dec. 14. </p>

<p>Laidley grew up in Balga in Perth's north and played senior football for the West Perth Football Club.</p>

<p>He made his debut for the West Coast Eagles in 1987, where he played 52 games before being traded to the North Melbourne ahead of the 1993 season.  </p>

<p>He won a premiership with the Kangaroos in 1996 and was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame in 2019. </p>

<p>His willingness to commit to contested balls earned him the nickname of 'The Junkyard Dog'. </p>

<p>His coaching career includes seven seasons with the Kangaroos between 2003 and 2009.</p>

<p>Laidley also spent time with Port Adelaide, St Kilda and Carlton.  </p>
