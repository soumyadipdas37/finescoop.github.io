<p>'I don't discuss that,' Mariah answered uncomfortably, trying to laugh it off.</p>

<p>Once she realized it was the real deal, Mariah said: 'I can't believe you did this to me Ellen.'</p>

<p>'This is peer pressure. Do you see what Ellen is doing? This is peer pressure,' the Grammy winner said while the audience roared with laughter.</p>
