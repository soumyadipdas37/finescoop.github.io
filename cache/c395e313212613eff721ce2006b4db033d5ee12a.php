<p>On Piers' final night of his summer holiday, thieves raided his villa, stealing valuables including jewellery and cash while the star and his family were sleeping inside.</p>

<p>They're back! Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid made their triumphant return to screens on Tuesday morning, following their two month summer break</p>

<p>Piers, who holidayed with his wife Celia Walden and their children, was keen to tell the story on GMB, revealing to Susanna: 'I got burgled on the last night a bunch of thieves in the house in the bedroom as we slept.</p>

<p>'Disgusting scumbag burglars creeping around my villa at night. I'm going to find you. Like Taken. We're on to you.' </p>

<p>'A flying squad London detective contacted me and some of his family got robbed in Cannes the same week, and he thought it was the same gang.'</p>

<p>Piers also explained a frightening detail, saying the detective told him in his family's case that thieves had used the tactic of putting gas canisters in the air conditioning to knock them out with no regard for the three-month-old baby who was staying in the villa.</p>

<p>Summer: The duo took their seats back on Good Morning Britain, and Piers began the show by regaling listeners with stories of his eventful break in St Tropez</p>

<p>He added that he believed the thieves had deliberately targeted his villa, saying: 'I can remember a few days before it happened a drone comes over,' he said. 'They were working out who was in the villa, where to go.'</p>

<p>The burglary wasn't the only event to put a dampener on Piers' summer fun as on the first night of his trip he chipped a bone in his feet, leaving him on crutches for two weeks. </p>

<p>'Night one,' he explained. 'Part of the fitness regime, I frogmarched down a half mile hill to a local restaurant, came out, badly sprained my ankle and then spent two weeks on crutches and five weeks drinking and eating and putting my foot in ice and trying to have conversations with french doctors.' </p>

<p>Ouch: On the first night of his holiday Piers chipped a bone in his feet, leaving him on crutches for two weeks (pictured with his sons)</p>

<p>'I was driven for an hour to have ultrasound to find out what's going on and he would only do my achilles, called it fine and point blank refused to do the rest of the ankle,' he complained of his treatment. </p>

<p>At the end of Piers' summer tales, Susanna teased her co-star for hogging the limelight, telling him he had been talking about himself for 'seven minutes'.</p>

<p>The duo's GMB return didn't go quite to plan as Charlotte Hawkins began the show solo, explaining to viewers that the duo would be joining her from 6:30am.</p>

<p>Charlotte also revealed Piers had arrived late to the studio, arriving just three minutes before he was due to go live.</p>

<p>Piers and his family arrived in the UK from Saint Tropez before tightening travel restrictions demanded visitors to France quarantine for 14 days upon their return, spending the final couple of weeks of their summer at their Sussex home. </p>
