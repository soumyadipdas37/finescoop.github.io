<p>Jesse Hogan (pictured on the Gold Coast in June) has been charged for breaching coronavirus self-quarantine after he allegedly invited a woman over to his home on two separate occasions</p>

<p>In a statement, the Dockers said Hogan allegedly admitted to police a woman attended his home twice on September 22. Hogan is pictured with friends at Flemington Racecourse last year</p>

<p>The club was notified of the alleged breach on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>Hogan is required to complete the remainder his 14-day quarantine, which is due to end on midnight October 5. </p>

<p>The Dockers squad flew out of Queensland on Monday September 21 after losing to the Western Bulldogs and missing out on the finals. </p>

<p>Hogan missed much of the 2020 preseason due to mental health issues and played three games over June and July before suffering an injury.</p>

<p>He returned for the last four games of the season and was on the field for the clash on Sunday September 20. </p>

<p>Fremantle CEO Simon Garlick said the club's players and staff are all aware of the current requirements.  </p>

<p>'We have worked very closely and effectively with WA police, the state government and the AFL throughout the year, which provided us with the opportunity to complete our AFL season,' Mr Garlick said.</p>

<p>'The cooperation and understanding we have received from all parties during the season is something we do not take for granted.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old (pictured on September 20) has been completing his mandatory 14-day isolation after returning home to Perth on Monday September 21</p>

<p>'This makes the breach even more disappointing and incredibly frustrating.'</p>

<p>Mr Garlick said the club would wait for Hogan to complete quarantine before determining what club-imposed sanction he will face.</p>

<p>'In the meantime, we will be reinforcing with all quarantined players and staff the importance of strict adherence to their quarantine protocols,' he said.</p>

<p>Fremantle said they have advised the AFL of the matter. </p>

<p>WA Police said Hogan was taken to a Perth hotel for the remainder of his quarantine period following the alleged brief.  </p>

<p>The 25-year-old from Attadale has been charged with two counts of Failure to Comply with a Direction and will appear in court at a later date.</p>

<p>Hogan has had a tumultuous few years.</p>

<p>He spent the second half of the 2019 season on the sidelines recovering from surgery after he injured his right foot for the second time in 12 months. </p>

<p>He missed nine weeks of the 2017 season due to his battle with testicular cancer.</p>

<p>He was diagnosed a month after he tragically lost his father to cancer. </p>
