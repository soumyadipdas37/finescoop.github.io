<p>The British No 1, fresh from her win against fellow compatriot Heather Watson on Tuesday, once again burst out of the blocks and wrapped up the first set 6-2 after dominating across the width of the court.</p>

<p>But the second set proved an ultimately more testing encounter. A number of forehand errors from Konta handed the plucky world No 77 a route back in, and Cirstea duly held her nerve to level the game on the tiebreak.</p>
