<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sheik Hamdan Al Maktoum and retained rider Jim Crowley are enjoying a stellar season and MINZAAL (Newmarket, 3.00) could provide the red-hot alliance with more Group race success.</p>

<p>Just seven days on from the emphatic success of Alkumait in the Mill Reef Stakes, Crowley is reunited with another exciting juvenile in the shape of the Mehmas colt who announced his presence on the world stage with a dominant Gimcrack Stakes success at York last month.</p>

<p>Still appearing as though he is learning on the job, Minzaal overcame his trademark slow start before slicing through the field in a style akin to last week’s Newbury winner.</p>

<p>Sportsmail's racing expert Robin Goodfellow dishes out his tips on Saturday's meetings</p>

<p>A two-length winning margin disguised the selection’s level of superiority over some useful rivals on the Knavesmire, while representing a huge leap forward from a Salisbury novice stakes success which amounted to little more than an exercise canter.</p>

<p>Today’s enthralling contest is no foregone conclusion, though, with both Method and Lucky Vega entitled to have their supporters for different reasons. The former was equally as impressive as Minzaal in Listed company at Newbury where he too displayed a smart burst of acceleration to score tidily.</p>

<p>There is a live chance we have yet to see the best of him also and he rates a huge threat if coping with the easier terrain and undulating track for the first time.</p>

<p>Events didn’t pan out well for Lucky Vega in the National Stakes at the Curragh where he was stopped in his run at a pivotal stage.</p>

<p>The opportunity to once again enjoy the tempo of a six- furlong race with a stiff climb to the line could see him return to the form which saw land the Phoenix Stakes in style from The Lir Jet.</p>

<p>The bet365 Cambridgeshire is one of the biggest betting races of the Flat season and, with some bookmakers offering enhanced place terms, ANYTHINGTODAY (Newmarket, 3.35) makes some appeal.</p>

<p>The ability to travel well in big-field, strongly-run handicaps is a vital attribute and the selection has done that a number of times without success this season.</p>

<p>Hopefully, a step back in trip can help the six-year-old hit the line stronger today.</p>
