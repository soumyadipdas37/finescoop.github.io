<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Genoa's Serie A match at Napoli has been delayed for a few hours after goalkeeper Mattia Perin tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The match on Sunday was scheduled to kick off at 3pm local time (13:00 GMT) but will start three hours later.</p>

<p>Genoa announced Perin's test result on Saturday. The players and staff underwent further tests and the results will be known later.</p>

<p>Genoa have announced that goalkeeper Mattia Perin has tested positive for coronavirusÂ </p>

<p>That means the team will fly to Naples on Sunday morning instead of Saturday night as originally planned.</p>

<p>The Italian government has also rejected a proposal to allow more spectators to watch sporting events, including the Serie A.</p>

<p>Italy's regions had suggested that the current limit of 1,000 spectators be increased to 25 per cent of stadium capacity, which would have allowed nearly 20,000 fans at bigger stadiums such as the San Siro in Milan and Rome's Stadio Olimpico.</p>

<p>The Italian government also rejected proposals to allow more fans back inside stadiums</p>

<p>However, the government's technical-scientific committee (CTS) said on Saturday that such a move would be premature due to the COVID-19 situation.</p>

<p>'The CTS believes that current conditions do not allow the participation of spectators in outdoor and indoor events in the manner indicated in the document prepared by the Conference of Regions and Autonomous Provinces,' it said in a statement.</p>

<p>The CTS added that it may reconsider its decision once it has more information about the impact on the COVID-19 situation of the re-opening of schools earlier this month.</p>
