<p>The Aston Villa star made his long-waited England debut after coming on for fellow debutant Kalvin Phillips in the 75th minute in Copenhagen.</p>

<p>Jack Greaiish said he was 'emotional' as he made his long-awaited England debut vs Denmark</p>

<p>The Aston Villa captain was brought on in the 75th minute for fellow debutant Kalvin Phillips</p>

<p>But after finally getting his first taste of international action, Grealish spoke of his honour and hoped it was the first of more to come for the Three Lions.</p>

<p>'I was actually a bit emotional,' he told Sky Sports after the game.</p>

<p>'It is something that you dream of, every child in England dreams of it since they were a little kid - playing for the England senior team. I was so privileged coming on and it was a shame we couldn't win in the end.</p>

<p>'I want to thank (manager) Gareth (Southgate) himself for giving me the opportunity and I hope it is the first of many.'</p>

<p>The 24-year-old thanked manager Gareth Southgate and hoped it would be the first of many</p>

<p>He had a limited amount of time to make an impact. His first notable involvement was a typical mazy run to try and find a winner but was unable to release a shot or find a team-mate. </p>

<p>While it was only a glimmer of a opening, the forward admitted he was disappointed he didn't make more of the opportunity so soon after coming on. </p>

<p>'My first involvement... I'm a bit gutted to be honest because I went on a little run and should have pulled the trigger or picked someone out.'</p>

<p>Grealish has had to wait five years for his first action since declaring his desire to play for England over the Republic of Ireland in 2015 after playing for them at youth level.</p>

<p>The Villa captain was initially overlooked for Southgate's squad but was drafted in following an injury to Marcus Rashford.</p>
