<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A restaurant manager has torn into two disgusting diners for allegedly 'sprinkling pubic hair' into their curry and kebab Mega Platter before refusing to pay for the £70 meal.</p>

<p>CCTV at Jaan's BBQ Kitchen Restaurant and Grill in Blackburn, Lancashire, captured the revolting moment one of the men appeared to reach into his shorts and scatter the supposed hair over their food.</p>

<p>The manager said: 'When it came to paying, they said there was hair in the food. We checked and there was hair on the biryani, kebabs and the naan breads as well.'</p>

<p>Baffled by the presence of strands in the dish, he checked the restaurant's cameras and accused the diners of deliberately sabotaging the food.</p>

<p>A 10-minute argument ended in stalemate, with neither side backing down and the men eventually walking out after leaving a mere £20.</p>

<p>A restaurant manager has torn into two disgusting diners for 'sprinkling pubic hair' into their curry and kebab Mega Platter before refusing to pay for the £70 meal</p>

<p>CCTV at Jaan's BBQ Kitchen Restaurant and Grill in Blackburn, Lancashire, captured the revolting moment one of the men appeared to reach into his shorts and scatter the supposed hair over their food</p>

<p>The manager, who wished to remain anonymous, said the men's actions were a 'horrible' disservice to Jaan's hard-working staff.</p>

<p>The alleged scam happened last month, and CCTV shows the casually dressed young men sitting at a table in a quite restaurant surrounded by food.</p>

<p>Describing the episode, the manager said: 'They came in early on a Thursday afternoon last month. </p>

<p>'They were one of our first customers as we normally open around 1pm. They first asked about the half-price offer which we said was on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'They ordered the Jaan's Mega Platter which costs £55. I remember thinking at the time this is certainly too big a meal for just two people and I even mentioned this to them. They also ordered some drinks and poppadoms.'</p>

<p>Jaan's Mega Platter is enough to feed six people and consists of three naan breads, chicken biryani, lamb biryani, chicken karahi, lamb karahi, seekh kebabs, chicken kebabs and six lamb chops.</p>

<p>The waitress who served them said: 'I went up to them and asked them if everything was 'OK' and they seemed happy enough and said the food was nice. They asked for more drinks.' </p>

<p>But when they were handed their £67 bill, the men pointed to the hair peppering their food and protested.</p>

<p>The manager recalled: 'At that point I thought something is a bit strange and checked the CCTV and it showed one man putting his hands under his cap and then into his shorts twice and sprinkling the contents on to the food.</p>

<p>'We argued for eight to 10 minutes and I told them the hair had been planted. Eventually they gave just £20 and left.'  </p>

<p>Dismayed by their behaviour, he added: 'It has not been an easy time for businesses and this was shocking. If we didn't check the camera that day then there was no way of finding out the truth.</p>

<p>'We have always tried to help with any customer queries and go out of our way to help people. </p>

<p>'We have got great reviews from people. We run a clean place and things like this are horrible and unfair on hard working folk.'</p>
