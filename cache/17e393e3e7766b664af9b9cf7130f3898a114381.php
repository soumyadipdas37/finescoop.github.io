<p>'Under the current funeral protocol, attendees who arrive from overseas or interstate are required to undertaken the 14-day period of quarantine prior to attending the funeral service,' the email read.</p>

<p>In another response from Queensland Health, she was told to travel to Sydney, then to Brisbane where she would quarantine for 14 days, in the event that the funeral was delayed.  </p>

<p>Ms Turner also pointed out that where she was from had no coronavirus cases while Brisbane and parts of Logan were now considered hot spots. </p>

<p>'Anyone from Logan can get to that funeral and they don't have any trouble,' she said. </p>

<p>'I would be less of a risk than anyone in the hot spots in Brisbane,' </p>

<p>Ms Turner also said that delaying the funeral would be too devastating for her four grandchildren.   </p>

<p>Mr Turner's daughter, Reanna, 20, said that her grandmother was 'hurting and she wants to say goodbye to her son'.  </p>
