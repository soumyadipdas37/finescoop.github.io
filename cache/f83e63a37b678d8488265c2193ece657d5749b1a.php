<p>One fan replied: 'Really mature tweet there. The girls have clearly had it in for you for a while now and they are just showing their true colours, as long as you are being looked after, supporter and know people care about your wellbeing that's all that matters. Forget them. </p>

<p>Others noted: 'Ever since Chloe B has been on TOWIE people have been bullying her... the same people sharing BeKind on their Instagram later that night.'</p>

<p>A fourth viewer added: 'I found it really uncomfortable to watch. I thought the show didn't need to show people digging you out like that. I didn't like it.</p>

<p>'Think its so disgusting 'mature' women <?php echo e('@'); ?>Nicolecharbass <?php echo e('@'); ?>oliviajade_att are bullying a teenager <?php echo e('@'); ?>ChloeBrockett1. But then they'll be the first to preach about trolling and online bullying etc,' typed another.  </p>

<p>While a different viewer typed: 'Olivia, Nicole and Clelia look so cool getting involved with Ella and Chloe's feud! It's honestly brave that they've chosen to forego storylines of their own in favour of bullying a teenager! They're not dry at all!'</p>
