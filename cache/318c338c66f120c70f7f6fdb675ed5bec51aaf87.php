<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An accused paedophile dragged out of his house in a dawn raid allegedly drugged at least one child and raped them four times.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old was one of 18 people, including 11 alleged paedophiles, arrested in a police operation against online predators.</p>

<p>The alleged paedophile ring is accused of using Facebook and Instagram to groom 140 teenagers, aged as young as 13, across Perth - 23 of whom were allegedly abused.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old, who has a long criminal history but no other previous sex charges, first faced Fremantle Magistrates' Court on July 1 on 14 charges.</p>

<p>At least 11 people have been arrested (pictured) after WA Police launched a four-month-long investigation into an alleged paedophile ring grooming teenagers through social media</p>

<p>His alleged crimes includes four counts of rape, one count of sexual penetration of a child between 13 and 16, and one of indecent assault.</p>

<p>Two other charges allege he administered drugs to procure unlawful sex, and another two that he encouraged a child aged 13 to 16 to engage in sexual activity.</p>

<p>There were also three possession of stolen property charges and one drug charge.</p>

<p>Police on the weekend released footage of the man's arrest at his home on Hossack Avenue in Parkwood, in Perth's south.</p>

<p>He is the oldest of the people aged 18 to 41 who have so far been charged in Operation Timing Belt, aiming to smash alleged paedophile rings in Perth.   </p>

<p>Detectives from the sex offender management squad launched the operation in April, resulting in 79 sexual offence charges being laid.   </p>

<p>The alleged predators (WA Police raid pictured) are accused of utilising popular social media apps like Facebook and Instagram to contact their victims </p>

<p>WA Police (pictured) seized computer equipment as evidence alongside the arrests </p>

<p>The operation identified 140 teenagers aged between 13 and 19 who were targeted by the group, and 23 of them were found to be victims of sexual abuse.  </p>

<p>WA Police said some of the accused offenders would compare information about their victims and share the targets. </p>

<p>Acting Detective Senior Sergeant Matt Daly said the accused predators allegedly contacted the teenagers through social media to 'ultimately engage in sexual contact with them'. </p>

<p>'The majority of offences are non-physical communication via popular social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, and via mobile phones,' he explained.    </p>

<p>WA Police also confiscated computer equipment in connection with the alleged abuse as part of the series of raids. </p>

<p>At least 18 accused people have been arrested and charged as part of the police operation</p>

<p>In all, 18 offenders had been charged as part of Operation Timing Belt, with 135 charges laid for non-sexual offences including drug, trespass and animal cruelty offences.   </p>

<p>State Crime Assistant Commissioner Brad Royce said Timing Belt showed that parents and children must be vigilant in terms of cyber safety.  </p>

<p>WA Police are continuing the investigation.</p>
