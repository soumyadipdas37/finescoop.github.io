<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cristiano Ronaldo may be ruled out of Portugal's upcoming Nations League fixtures after picking up an infection in his right foot. </p>

<p>The Juventus ace had been hoping to lead the line for the double-header against Croatia and Sweden over the next few days, but is now receiving treatment with an antibiotic to deal with the issue.  </p>

<p>Ronaldo's absence from training on Thursday was announced by the Portuguese FA, and it is believed that the forward's involvement in both European clashes is now at risk.  </p>

<p>Cristiano Ronaldo may be ruled out of Portugal's Nations League fixtures due to an infection</p>

<p>After being confined to gym work on Wednesday, Ronaldo faces a battle to prove he has shaken off the infection and will now be evaluated on a day-to-day basis by medical staff. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old will certainly be fit in time to begin the new Serie A campaign under Andrea Pirlo on September 20, however.</p>

<p>Juventus will begin their title defence, and their new era, against Sampdoria.  </p>

<p>Due to the injury not affecting Ronaldo's muscles or bones, it is understood that Juventus are not overtly worried by their talisman's condition. </p>

<p>The Portugal talisman may be forced to wait for his 100th international goal due to his setback</p>

<p>The club will contact Portugal to be kept updated on his progress. </p>

<p>A further source of frustration for Ronaldo will be his potential failure to score his 100th international goal in either of the two games. </p>

<p>His 99th strike came against Luxembourg in November, and the superstar's wait may now stretch even further.  </p>

<p>Portugal play Croatia on Saturday and will then travel to Sweden on Tuesday.</p>
