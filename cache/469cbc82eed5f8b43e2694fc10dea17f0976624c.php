<p>The master bathroom is decorated with marble-style walls, extravagant chandeliers, and bold touches of orange</p>

<p>A large upstairs bathroom has mirrored walls and a sunken bathtub which was specially designed for the home </p>

<p>However, she reveals, originally the home wasn't quite as pink. 'When I first built the house, the central staircase was brown — and then I said, "That's gotta go", 'I love pink.' </p>

<p>And so it began. The pink shades began appearing all of over the home from a bath and tiles along with wall coverings and window trim. </p>

<p>An upstairs living room that once had blue carpeting was covered in a soft baby pink color.</p>

<p>The sunken living room area leads to a pink-carpeted dining room with a kitchen nearby, while a pink hallway leads to three of the four bedrooms with the same soft pink carpet running throughout. </p>

<p>The home is at 820 W. Fingerboard Road in Staten Isladn, a few minutes west of the ramp to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge</p>

<p>The home has been owned by Barbara and Richard DeLeo since it was built for them in 1969</p>

<p>Set on a 4,312-square-foot lot, the home also has a spacious backyard area and a large patio</p>

<p>From the outside, the home is completely unassuming and built from brown bricks but once inside, the decor which is distinctly 1970s, will make any new owners feel as though they are walking into a living time capsule.</p>

<p>Despite its age, the home has been lovingly cared for. At one point several generations of the DeLeo family lived there, together with the couple's children, Barbara Lynn and Anthony who are now in their 60s. Their grandparents and an aunt lived downstairs. It also explains where a kitchen was built on each floor. </p>

<p>DeLeo said the decision to finally sell has not been an easy one. 'I was heartbroken, really,' she said to the Post.  </p>

<p>'My brother and I both cried when we told the real-estate agent to take it,' her daughter Barbara said as she recalled the home having 'a lot of happy memories. A lot of parties went on in that house.'</p>

<p>'It was bright and cheery. I don't think all the men loved it too much, but my father never complained,' she said.</p>

<p>The family are hoping that whoever snaps up the place will care for it in the same loving manner it has been up to now. </p>

<p>'God was good to me, and I took care of it, because I loved it,' DeLeo said. </p>

<p>The kitchen area is a haven away from the other pink areas of the home and see refreshingly cool floor tiles and cabinets</p>

<p>The kitchen is open plan and runs into the nearby formal dining room area of the home</p>

<p>The home was built from scratch with arches carved out between the upper-level living and dining rooms</p>

<p>A basement kitchen is similarly free of any pink furnishings although a pink blanket can be seen in the left of this picture</p>

<p>The downstairs kitchen also leads directly into a lounge basement area, again without any door making for an open plan</p>

<p>A cozy office space has red floors and a single exposed brick wall in a departure from the pinkness of the rest of the home</p>
