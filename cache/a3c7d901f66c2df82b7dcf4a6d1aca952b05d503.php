<p>The 1973 Holden LJ Torana GTR has been sitting in a defunct Ford Dealership in the NSW Riverina town of West Wyalong for the past 35 years after being traded in by a rev head in 1985.</p>

<p>Auctioneers Burns &amp; Co says the classic car only has 86,000km on the odometer and is still in fairly good condition.</p>

<p>It might be a little dusty but an old Australian muscle car is expected to fetch as much as $100,000 at an upcoming auction</p>

<p>'The GTR was developed as the sports version of the Torana range, and though not as hot as the race-bred XU-1 variant, the 1973 Torana GTR was fitted with the 3.3-litre inline-six producing 101kW, coupled with the Aussie-built M21 four-speed manual gearbox,' the website Car Advice reported.</p>

<p>'The dirt-covered VIN plate, showing LJ82911 as the model name, confirms this is a genuine GTR.'</p>

<p>Over the past few months several rare Australian cars have been scooped up for extraordinary prices after being discovered in barns and sheds.</p>

<p>The most notable was the sale of a Ford Falcon XA GT RPO 83 'Chicken Coupe' which sold for a staggering $300,000 at auction in South Australia.</p>

<p>The 1973 Holden LJ Torana GTR has been sitting in a defunct Ford Dealership in the NSW Riverina town of West Wyalong for the past 35 years after being traded in by a rev head in 1985</p>

<p>A Fully restored Torana GTR can sell for over $100,000.</p>

<p>Although this one is not exactly pristine, in the current climate it is still extremely rare and likely to attract a very high price from car lovers.</p>

<p>The Auction which is set to go ahead on October 3 and 4, will also feature a few other very sought after cars.</p>

<p>A 1961 Fairlane 'tank' sedan will go under the hammer along with a 2005 Falcon XR8 Devil R with and a 2016 Falcon FGX XR6 ute.</p>

<p>When the original owner traded in the GTR back in 1985, he said he paid $900 for it.</p>
