<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dog owners are used to finding all sorts buried in the earth – toys, stolen nick-nacks or fiercely-guarded bones.</p>

<p>But keen gardener Joanne Gudger was floored when she unearthed a bizarre-looking potato – which was the 'spitting image' of her dog, Dave.</p>

<p>Mrs Gudger, 47, shared a photo of the oddly-shaped spud alongside an image of her jowly, 13-year-old American bulldog with friends and fellow gardeners.</p>

<p>The mother-of-three, from Atherstone, Warwickshire, said she also sent a photo to her 'other half' Mark who commented: 'It's the spitting image of him.'</p>

<p>Mrs Gudger said: 'We now call him 'potato head Dave'. We didn't want to eat the potato because it'd be hard to eat a masterpiece like that.'</p>

<p>Keen gardener Joanne Gudger, 47, was floored when she unearthed a bizarre-looking potato – which was the 'spitting image' of her dog, Dave</p>

<p>She added: 'I still keep laughing about it because I'll probably never grow a potato that looks like my own dog again.' </p>

<p>'As soon as I pulled it out of the soil I knew straight away that it looked like Dave and I took a picture to send to my other half, Mark - even he said it's the spitting image of him.</p>

<p>'Dave is really poorly at the moment with Cushing's disease which is incurable so this really cheered us up.</p>

<p>'He's getting older now and is going a bit grey so he probably looks more like the potato than ever!</p>

<p>'It was just perfect how the potato had Dave's jowls and everything.'</p>

<p>Joanne decided to post the potato pic to various allotment groups on Facebook, where it unexpectedly racked up hundreds of likes.</p>

<p>She said: 'Everyone was joking in the comments and saying that they're going to be careful digging their potatoes up in the future in case they dig up a puppy.</p>

<p>'It has also been a breath of fresh air due to my job working for a care company and dealing with Covid - my colleagues all think it's hilarious!</p>

<p>'Our carers visit our vulnerable customers in their own homes providing crucial support. It's obviously been a very trying time but this has cheered us all up massively.'</p>
