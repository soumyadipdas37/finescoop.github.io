<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An alopecia sufferer who first lost her hair when she was just two-years-old has finally decided to stop the condition ruining her life - and has gone completely bald. </p>

<p>Robyn Bridge, 27, shaved her head after being sick of trying to cover up ever-increasing bald patches that left her feeling 'disgusted' with herself.</p>

<p>The mother-of-two, from Westhoughton, Bolton, Lancashire, took 39-year-old fiance Andrew Farrell's clippers and shaved it all off in June.</p>

<p>Robyn Bridge, 27, (pictured) shaved her head after being sick of trying to cover up ever-increasing bald patches that left her feeling 'disgusted' with herself</p>

<p>She said: 'I then cried for three days and then I felt free. I felt an enormous release of pressure and stress. I have felt amazing since.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I went swimming with my boys for the first time ever as I didn't have to worry about wearing a wig.</p>

<p>'I can now go to the gym without fear of messing up my strategically styled hair. This has been the most freeing thing I have ever done.' </p>

<p>The carer, who has two boys aged one and three, had her first episode of hair loss when she was just two-years-old, when her parents split up. </p>

<p>She said: 'Of course, I wasn't aware of that incident. It wasn't until I was around 11 or 12-years-old that I had the first episode that I was actually aware of.'</p>

<p>Robyn says her alopecia is caused by stress, with her hair falling out at trigger points in her life like taking exams and taking her driving test.</p>

<p>She added: 'I was never an overly anxious person, but the hair loss made me anxious, it is a catch 22 situation.</p>

<p>'Aside from losing my hair, my hair is actually really thick and long, I loved my hair, so losing it was particularly hard.'</p>

<p>Robyn would fashion her hair in different styles and partings, use root spray, or wear cheap £30 wigs from Amazon or a baseball cap.</p>

<p>But her main way of hiding her hair eventually became to hide away altogether and said: 'I thought that I was disgusting.' </p>

<p>Robyn tried hair loss treatments, including one where a mesh is bonded to the existing hair and strips of extensions are sewn through.</p>

<p>At one point had a full head of hair but this was fleeting, only lasting until she had her second child in February 2019 when her hair loss went into overdrive.</p>

<p>Her long dark tresses were now barely covering her head and it was impossible to cover meaning she couldn't continue with hair loss treatment.  </p>

<p>As she spoke to others in alopecia forums Robyn came across other women who had embraced their bald heads.  </p>

<p>After shaving her hair off, she first continued to wear her wigs but would take them off without a thought when it rained as you can't get synthetic wigs wet.  </p>

<p>She said: 'There was no big moment when I decided to brave the world with my new self, I slowly eased myself into it so that I didn't actually even notice the transition.</p>

<p>'But now I don't wear a wig at all.</p>

<p>'The benefits of no hair are amazing - I can shower in two minutes, I save money on hair products, I can go out in the rain without a care and not worry about my boys pulling at my hair.</p>

<p>Robyn tried hair loss treatments and at one point had a full head of hair but this was fleeting so she couldn't continue with hair loss treatment</p>

<p>'I have had a few funny looks and some will even ask me what's happened, but I expect that and I'm fine with that.</p>

<p>'People mainly think I am going through chemotherapy, but I am happy to explain about alopecia. The more people know about the condition the better.'</p>

<p>She added: 'Luckily, I do not have a life-threatening condition, I am fit and healthy and I now embrace that.</p>

<p>'The way I feel now, I can honestly say I am not wishing for my hair back.</p>

<p>'Of course having a natural head of hair would be a bonus but I am completely happy the way I am.'</p>
