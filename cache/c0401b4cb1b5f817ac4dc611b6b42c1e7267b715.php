<p>Reever Botha and Vlad Kosovac, both 25, launched PuraU in March 2020, just as Australians were ordered to stay home due to the COVID-19 outbreak. </p>

<p>But the timing couldn't have been better for the business partners, who earned $25,000 in the first three weeks their product was on the market. </p>

<p>The PuraU three-part Gut Cleanse Kit supports natural cleansing and a healthy immune system, timely given the world is trying to restore itself to full health.</p>

<p>The pills - which are vegan and Australian made - can relieve acne, eczema, rosacea, bloating, indigestion, gassiness and gut inflammation.  </p>

<p>All PuraU products have been developed by a naturopathic and herbal expert and the goods were permitted for use by the TGA.</p>

<p>Customers have been coming forward to share their success stories on the pills, including 21-year-old Acacia Clarke from Brisbane, Queensland.</p>

<p>Keira Houldsworth, 25, also from Brisbane, said her 'three month pregnant belly of bloating' subsided and redness in her cheeks disappeared within two weeks of using the pills</p>

<p>'I wanted to heal the hormonal acne I had suffered from since I was 15 years old,' she told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>She saw results within the first 10 days of the cleanse and felt like she had 'completely new skin' after the gut cleanse finished on the 20th day.</p>

<p>'It has truly gotten me far better results than anything else I've tried,' she said.</p>

<p>Shanae Horsburgh, 21, had similar issues with bloating and found the cleansing kit to be of great use (pictured)</p>

<p>'No matter what I was feeding my body, no matter how many times I changed my diet and eliminated certain food groups I would always end up with a bloated and sore stomach,' the young woman from Sydney said.</p>

<p>'Not only did PuraU have amazing ingredients that were backed up by research, but really thought about the planet with their packaging, everything is recyclable.'  </p>

<p>Mr Botha told FEMAIL previously that it was 'daunting' launching their Gut Cleanse Kit as the pandemic took hold, but the friend went on 'full steam ahead'.</p>

<p>'We're happy to say we launched through COVID,' he said. 'It was a shining light for us, e-commerce has boomed. People are at home and have the opportunity to buy things on their phone.'</p>

<p>Mr Kosovac said the global health crisis meant the business partners needed to refocus their launch plan.</p>

<p>'We initially said we need to work a lot smarter, use the pandemic as a strategy. It was about acing our marketing,' he said. After four months, the business made $250,000.  </p>

<p>It's been a 'stressful' road to success for the pair, who first met at a business seminar in Sydney. </p>

<p>Mr Botha had completed a Bachelor of Business Management at Queensland University of Technology and was attending seminars in the field.  </p>

<p>'I knew I wanted to have my own business, I didn't want to go down the corporate path,' he explained. The pair 'bonded' at the seminar and kept in contact for a couple of months.</p>

<p>They met for coffee in Brisbane and the rest is history. 'F*** it dude,' Mr Botha recalled. 'Let's start our business together'. </p>

<p>The pair quickly decided to focus their product on digestion, as they are both passionate about health and fitness.   </p>

<p>'Our guts have been rotten our whole life. So that's one thing we're passionate about, so we thought let's smash it out of the park,' Mr Botha said.  </p>

<p>The pills - which are vegan and Australian made - can relieve acne, eczema, rosacea, bloating, indigestion, gassiness and gut inflammation</p>

<p>Mr Kosovac, who is from Melbourne, then moved to Queensland to live with Mr Botha in his parents' Brisbane home. </p>

<p>While he misses Melbourne, Mr Kosovac said he would have moved anywhere for the benefit of the business.</p>

<p>'I've got to do what's best for the business. It didn't matter where,' he said. </p>

<p>The business partners spent six months conducting research and developing a plan. They then found a manufacturer and received approval from Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). </p>

<p>After four months, the business made $250,000. Pictured: Evelien Langeveld with the product </p>

<p>'We're happy,' Mr Botha said. 'We spent a lot of time, money and effort for 12 months without seeing a return. </p>

<p>'There were times when we wanted to give up. We're just happy we've stuck with it, we've done everything right.' </p>

<p>The pair are now hoping to take their business into retail, with their sights set on Priceline.   </p>

<p>Mr Botha concluded: 'Throughout this pandemic, it's shown why people should be on top of their health.'    </p>
