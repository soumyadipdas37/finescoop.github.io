<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A trio of female lawmakers from Pennsylvania have posed topless for a new get-out-the-vote campaign which aims to educate voters on new mail-in ballot rules that were announced in the state for the upcoming election. </p>

<p>Allegheny County council members Bethany Hallam, 30, and Liv Bennett, 42, and House candidate Emily Kinkead, 33, all went nearly nude for the attention-grabbing campaign, which warns voters not to forget to seal their mail-in ballots inside the provided secrecy envelope — or else they'll be thrown out by election officials.</p>

<p>'Desperate times call for desperate measures!' Hallam tweeted last week. 'So your favorite elected officials got naked so that you remember to make sure that your mail-in ballot is NOT submitted without its secrecy envelope!'</p>

<p>Vote! A trio of female lawmakers from Pennsylvania have posed topless for a new get-out-the-vote campaign which aims to educate voters on new mail-in ballot rules</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that ballots not sealed inside the secrecy envelope can be rejected (pictured: Emily Kinkead, who is running for a state House seat in the 20th District)</p>

<p>On September 17, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that 'naked ballots' — those not sealed inside the secrecy envelope — can be rejected by election officials.</p>

<p>Some are predicting that this could lead to up to 100,000 Pennsylvania ballots being thrown out. </p>

<p>So candidates in the state have begun launching initiatives to educate voters on the new rule to ensure that all ballots will be counted. </p>

<p>Certainly the most distinctive one so far was released by Hallam, Bennett, and Kinkead, who all posed nude from the waist up in front of a brick wall.</p>

<p>Those very important secrecy ballots were Photoshopped over their chests for privacy — and to make their point. </p>

<p>'No one wants a naked politician — or a naked ballot!' tweeted Kinkead, who is running for a state House seat in the 20th District. 'Don't forget your secrecy envelope when you mail in your ballot.' </p>

<p>'If we have to get naked to get this message across, that’s what we’re willing to do,' said Allegheny County council member Bethany Hallam</p>

<p>'Desperate times call for desperate measures!' Hallam, 30, tweeted last week</p>

<p>'No one wants a naked politician — or a naked ballot!' tweeted Kinkead</p>

<p>Running along the bottom of one version of the ad are the words: 'The public doesn't need to see everything. Don't forget your secrecy envelope!' </p>

<p>Another reads: 'Whoops! Good thing I've got my secrecy envelope!'</p>

<p>The campaign also includes step by step instructions for how to properly fill out and enclose a mail-in ballot.  </p>

<p>'If you don’t do even one of those two things, your ballot will be thrown out and you won’t even know,' Hallam told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. 'If we have to get naked to get this message across, that’s what we’re willing to do.</p>

<p>'There’s a lot misinformation going around about mail-in voting. It’s brand new. Most voters, this is the first time they’re ever voting by mail,' she went on.</p>

<p>'I reached out to my friends who are elected officials, as well, and I was like, "Hey, I have this wild idea. Let’s get naked to try to save our democracy."' </p>

<p>'There’s a lot misinformation going around about mail-in voting. It’s brand new. Most voters, this is the first time they’re ever voting by mail,' said Hallam (left; Kinkead pictured right)</p>

<p>Kinkead is glad to see that it has caught the public's attention. </p>

<p>'People are talking about it. It’s getting a lot of attention to just the existence of secrecy ballots,' she said. 'We’re getting people who are saying, "I didn’t even know about the secrecy envelope."'</p>

<p>Liv Bennett, who also posed for the campaign, is an Allegheny County council member</p>

<p>'I’m not just trying to protect Democratic voters,' added Hallam. 'I’m trying to make sure all voters ballots are counted.'</p>

<p>The campaign has earned plenty of positive feedback, with commenters calling it 'awesome,' 'amazing,' 'brilliant,' 'clever,' and 'wonderful' — and several calling for male candidates to do a version, too.</p>

<p>'This is... quite a unique method to talk about naked ballots in PA. 10/10 for originality. Remember, your voting rights “are real. And they are fantastic!”' wrote Michigan news anchor Nick LaFave.</p>

<p>In fact, the posts had few critics — though among them was the women's colleague Keith Rothfus, a Republican in Pennsylvania's 12th District.</p>

<p>'And this is the crowd that thinks <?php echo e('@'); ?>RealDonaldTrump is vulgar? Really?' he tweeted. 'So looking forward to confirmation of #ACB as our next #SupremeCourt Justice.'</p>

<p>Kinkead fired back: 'Now powerless man who spent career working to deny women ownership of their bodies and power is big mad that women in power are owning their bodies.' </p>
