<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A stray donkey made a right ass of itself when it needed rescuing by locals after it got its head stuck in a plastic chair in the United Arab Emirates.</p>

<p>Salem Al Kaabi, 43, spotted the struggling creature as he drove to his farm in Masfut, near Hatta, in Ajman.</p>

<p>He called some of his friends and family to help capture the stricken donkey before they managed to free it.</p>

<p>The chair is thought to have been left by a visitor to the area and it was digging into the animal's snout and neck, breaking the skin beneath it.</p>

<p>Mr Al Kaabi, who works with the police, used a handsaw to free the donkey before disinfecting its injuries and then setting it free.</p>

<p>He said: 'When the donkey saw us coming, she ran away and one of us followed her to the wadi and ‎managed to catch her and we all jumped in to help. ‎</p>

<p>‎'Seeing the donkey with a chair around her neck and face was unpleasant but it did not occur to me ‎that the chair would cause her severe injuries. </p>

<p>‎'It wasn’t easy to take the chair out so we needed tools and more hands to keep the donkey still.'</p>

<p>Locals struggle to free the injured donkey which was spotted with its head stuck in a plastic chair in the UAE</p>

<p> He added: 'I am familiar in dealing with animals as I raise livestock at my farm, so I asked one of the men to ‎go to the veterinary clinic and grab a disinfectant wound spray for animals.</p>

<p>‎'Our town is close to Hatta and many visitors come to the area during the weekend so I guess the ‎chair was left behind by them. </p>

<p>Locals had to free the injured donkey after it became stuck in a plastic chair near Hatta, in Ajman</p>

<p>‎'Municipality workers work hard to keep the area clean and people should avoid leaving ‎rubbish behind.</p>

<p>‎'Littering can harm many wild animals in the area such as birds, wild goats and hedgehogs plus the ‎environment, which is totally unacceptable.'</p>

<p> Mr Al Kaabi is now searching for the injured donkey, which he and ten people freed last Friday, after an animal rescue centre offered to to examine and treat it.</p>

<p>Manal Al Mansoori, founder and director of Yanni Animal Welfare, said they aimed to treat the donkey to Zabeel Veterinary Hospital.‎</p>

<p>‎She said: 'I saw the video of the rescue yesterday and immediately started searching for Mr Al Kaabi. ‎</p>

<p>‎'The donkey appeared to have deep injuries and needed medical assistance so I asked him to try ‎and locate the animal.‎</p>

<p>‎'She is probably hiding due to her pain and we need to find her before his condition becomes ‎worse.‎</p>

<p>The group freed the donkey which is now being sought so that it can be treated at Zabeel Veterinary Hospital</p>

<p>'Her treatment might cost between Dh7,000 to Dh8,000 and we are willing to cover it with the help of the ‎volunteers and the community, but we have to find her before she gets blood poisoning due to her ‎wounds.'</p>

<p> Ms Al Mansoori has asked people not to leave litter which can cause injuries to animals.</p>

<p>She said: ‎'We receive many cases of stray cats with deep cuts due to the unsafe disposal of sharp objects ‎and old furniture. ‎</p>

<p>'Litter left behind after picnicking or camping can also harm the wildlife and environment ‎and everyone should be held accountable.'</p>
