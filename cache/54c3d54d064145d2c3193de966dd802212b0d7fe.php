<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Millions of homes and businesses are set to gain access to ultra-fast broadband speeds of up to one gigabit per second in an upgrade to the National Broadband Network.</p>

<p>The $4.5 billion network investment plan will give up to 75 per cent of fixed line premises across regional and metropolitan Australia access to ultra-fast broadband by 2023.</p>

<p>It will be financed through NBN Co borrowing from private debt markets.</p>

<p>Communications Minister Paul Fletcher said Australians have a growing appetite for faster broadband speeds.</p>

<p>'This is the right time for this network upgrade,' he said, ahead of a speech to the National Press Club on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'There is a long term trend of broadband demand growth with a very significant spike this year as COVID-19 has changed the way we use the internet.'</p>

<p>The plan will involve on-demand fibre to the node upgrades, capacity upgrades on the hybrid fibre coaxial network and work on the fibre to the curb network.</p>

<p>From an economic perspective, the NBN is estimated to increase Australia's GDP by $6.4 billion a year by 2024, including $1.5 billion into regional areas.</p>
