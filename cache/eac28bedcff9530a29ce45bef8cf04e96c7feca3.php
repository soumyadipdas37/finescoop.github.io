<p>Lauren Child, 54, shared items of significance inside her studio in north London</p>

<ol>
<li>WILD CHILD</li>
</ol>

<p>I loved being outdoors and this photo with my guinea pigs was in my local paper in Wiltshire when I was seven.</p>

<p>Our garden was being used for a fete, and I’d spent all my money on these terrible old necklaces. My father was head of art at Marlborough College – of his three daughters, I was the one who liked drawing.</p>

<p>My mother was a primary teacher and read endless stories to us. I did the same with my daughter Tuesday, who’s now ten.  </p>

<p>A picture of Shirley Temple, which Lauren framed because she liked her expression</p>

<li>SEA THE LIGHT</li>
</ol>

<p>I wasn’t an overnight success – there was lots of failure and anxiety along the way. I studied illustration, but left after a year and was at a low ebb, so started saying yes to everything.</p>

<p>I worked for Damien Hirst, painting his spot paintings. I even set up a lampshade business. It was almost impossible to turn a profit, and we didn’t!</p>

<p>I used the design on this one to represent the sea in my first Charlie And Lola book. </p>

<li>MY WORLD IN MINIATURE</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve always been attracted to fairy tales because they’re so peculiar and often have a horror element. It took me two years to create these mini 3D scenes for The Princess And The Pea, which were shot by photographer Polly Borland for the book.</p>

<p>The doll figure and the fabric in the small perspex box are made from paper. The scene next to it has layers cut in wood and paper. It was incredibly time-consuming. </p>

<li>PERFECT FIT</li>
</ol>

<p>I bought these boots 25 years ago in a second-hand shop in San Francisco when on holiday with my then boyfriend.</p>

<p>They fitted perfectly and have been round the world with me many times since. I tend not to wear fancy shoes any more – I’ve got to that point where I don’t really care, they just feel right.</p>

<p>I love clothes but am very sentimental about them and when I find something I like to wear I just keep it.</p>

<p>The dress by the window was made from a fabric I designed for Liberty, as part of a celebration of Alice In Wonderland. </p>

<li>CHILDHOOD HEROES</li>
</ol>

<p>I remember framing this picture of Shirley Temple because I liked her expression. That slightly cross look cheers me up – she’s not going to be told what to do by anybody.</p>

<p>A miniature table, bottle and glasses</p>

<p>I was given the Peanuts mug next to it when I was nine because I was obsessed with Charles Schulz. He taught me that you can talk to adults and children at the same time. </p>

<ol start="6">
<li>NOT-SO-PERFECTLY FORMED</li>
</ol>

<p>My aunt gave me this miniature table, bottle and glasses as a girl and they were the most perfect thing I’d ever been given. I had a dolls’ house built from an old cupboard and I would make things for it.</p>

<p>To miniaturists in the know these would be seen as very, very clunky. But I really enjoy things being both perfect and imperfect.</p>

<p>Some dolls’ houses are so perfect that in a picture you can’t tell what size things are, but I like it when you suddenly get a giant toast rack or kettle that’s totally out of scale.</p>
