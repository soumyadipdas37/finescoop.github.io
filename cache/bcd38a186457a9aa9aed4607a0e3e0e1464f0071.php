<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Antonio Conte is reportedly eyeing up a reunion with Marcos Alonso at Inter Milan this summer.</p>

<p>The pair worked together during the Italian's two-year spell in charge of Chelsea in which they won a Premier League and the FA Cup.</p>

<p>Alonso's future at Stamford Bridge is up in the air, particularly after Frank Lampard's side completed the signing of left-back Ben Chilwell from Leicester for £50m.</p>

<p>Marcos Alonso could be set to leave Chelsea following the arrival of Ben Chilwell this summer</p>

<p>Antonio Conte is reportedly 'determined' to reunite with the 29-year-old Spanish full-back</p>

<p>Sky Sports Italia are now reporting that Conte is 'determined' to bring Alonso to the club as he looks to build an even more competitive squad ahead of next season.</p>

<p>However any move could depend on potential outgoings from the Nerazzuri.</p>

<p>Out-of-favour Inter Milan full-back Dalbert has returned to the club from a loan spell at Fiorentina but is not expected to break into the side.</p>

<p>Should he leave the club this this summer, it is expected Conte will push forward with his pursuit of Alonso.</p>

<p>Together at Chelsea the pair won both the Premier League and FA Cup between 2016 and 18</p>

<p>It would not be the first time that Conte has reunited with one of his Chelsea title winners at Inter Milan.</p>

<p>Victor Moses who was a regular under Conte at Stamford Bridge, spent last-season on loan at Inter where he made 20 appearances in all competitions.</p>

<p>Alonso signed for Chelsea in 2016 from Fiorentina for a fee of around £24 million.</p>

<p>During that time he has scored 22 goals in 149 appearances for the club, but his game-time has dropped since Lampard was appointed last summer. </p>
