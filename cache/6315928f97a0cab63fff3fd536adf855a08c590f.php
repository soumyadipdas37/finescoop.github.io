<p>A GiveALittle fundraiser had been set up to raise money so Ms Mullins could undergo the highly expensive Keytruda treatment.</p>

<p>Keytruda, which is unfunded by the government, is an immunotherapy treatment which helps the immune system detect and fight cancer cells.</p>

<p>More than $16,000 was raised for Ms Mullins to undergo the treatment before she passed away.</p>

<p>On top of her diagnosis, the coronavirus pandemic effectively forced Powerstation to close. </p>
