<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man at the centre of a mass brawl at a Sydney racecourse has been banned from alcohol for a year but avoided jail.</p>

<p>Brandon Locke-Walker, 22, pleaded guilty to affray on Tuesday after fighting with up to 30 people at the Rosehill Racecourse in Western Sydney in December.</p>

<p>The melee was dubbed 'War of the Roses' with photographers capturing Locke-Walker and several men hurling punches and ripping each other's clothes.</p>

<p>The brawl got its name after one woman tried to break up the scuffle by thumping Locke-Walker over the head with a bouquet of roses.</p>

<p>Locke-Walker faced Parramatta Local Court on Tuesday and was banned from drinking alcohol for a year.</p>

<p>He was also given a seven-month intensive correction order and will have to undergo 75 hours of community service, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>The court heard the fight kicked off after one of Locke-Walker's friends made a comment about another reveller's girlfriend.</p>

<p>The apprentice metal fitter was then joined by his mates, Bailey Petrie and Matthew Samuel Becker, as they began brawling with Nathan Luke and his father Stephen.</p>

<p>The court heard at the time of the Rosehill scuffle Locke-Walker was on a good behaviour bond for another fight at a pub two years ago in NSW's Lake Macquarie area.</p>

<p>His lawyer on Tuesday told the court Locke-Walker had since sought help for his depression and anxiety following the tussle.</p>

<p>'He has the support of his partner and family. One positive that has come out of it is that he has finally taken the steps to seek some mental health treatment,' he said. </p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Price said the 22-year-old played an active role in the brawl. </p>

<p>Security guards watch on, helpless to stop the Rosehill Racecourse brawl that has since been dubbed 'the war of the roses'</p>

<p>'The concern … is the use of alcohol and misuse of alcohol and responses to situations you find yourself in,' she said.</p>

<p>'You don't have a lengthy criminal history but you certainly have a history of a similar nature.'</p>

<p>Becker and Petrie were earlier each sentenced to 18 months of community service and an $800 fine.</p>

<p>Nathan Luke was also handed an $800 fine and an intensive corrections order.</p>

<p>Stephen Luke is yet to be sentenced but was charged with affray. </p>
