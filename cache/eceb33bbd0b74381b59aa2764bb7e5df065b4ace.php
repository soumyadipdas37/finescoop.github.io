<p>The 60-year-old said: 'The greatest thing about Naya Rivera was that she would be the first one to speak up if something was happening that wasn't right, that wasn't fair, that was cruel. If you were a friend of hers, you knew it, you could feel it.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'Just such a fierce force of nature that girl was. It's a great loss. It's a great loss for all of us.'</p>

<p>Naya's body was discovered July 13 in Lake Piru in Ventura County, California, five days after she went missing during a swim with son Josey.</p>
