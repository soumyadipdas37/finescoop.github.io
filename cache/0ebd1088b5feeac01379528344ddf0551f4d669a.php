<p>Former Jockey Keith Watson (pictured in 1985) was with three friends on a vessel off the coast of Broome, in Western Australia, in the early hours of Monday when the boat started to sink</p>

<p>Police made contact but soon lost communication and the men abandoned the vessel.</p>

<p>WA Police said the men couldn't access the tender that was attached to the vessel as it began to sink, The West Australian reported.</p>

<p>All of the men jumped off the boat, with three heading to another one nearby while Mr Watson attempted the 500m swim back to shore.</p>

<p>While the three other men survived, Mr Watson drowned while making the desperate journey back to shore. </p>

<p>Volunteers from the Broome Marine Rescue found his body a short time later near Cable Beach.</p>

<p>Senior Sergeant Dave Whitnell said an investigation into the 'tragic incident' was currently underway. </p>

<p>'The group had been sailing up and down the Kimberley region for the last couple of weeks,' he said. </p>

<p>The three surviving men were 'shaken up' and were shocked when they noticed how quickly the boat started to sink.</p>

<p>Mr Watson was a champion jockey in Western Australian throughout the 1970s and 80s, riding Heron Bridge to victory in the Newmarket at Flemington in 1984.</p>

<p>The men, all aged in their 70s, desperately made radio calls at 12.45am to alert authorities the vessel had started 'taking on water' (pictured where the boat was parked)</p>

<p>He then embarked on a racing career in Mauritius where he became a successful businessman after retiring.</p>

<p>Close friend and former jockey Bernie Ryan said he had lost a great friend in a 'tragedy'.</p>

<p>'He was a very good jockey and a terrific person,' Mr Ryan said.</p>

<p>'He was just a really decent person, a great rider and a thorough gentleman. He will be sadly missed. This will be a shock to the whole racing industry.'</p>

<p>The three other men remain in hospital with minor injuries. </p>

<p>None of the men wore lifejackets.</p>

<p>The Department of Transport will also prepare a maritime safety investigation report.   </p>
