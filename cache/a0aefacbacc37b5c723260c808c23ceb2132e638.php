<p>Jamie Raine was one of three friends who tested positive after returning home from a four-day trip to Zante. Seven friends who had gone to the Greek island the week before also caught Covid</p>

<p>Later, those on board joined hundreds of others in the island’s nightclubs and continued the party on the beaches afterwards.</p>

<p>One tourist has told of his guilt at selfishly bringing Covid-19 home.</p>

<p>Jamie Raine was one of three friends who tested positive after returning home from a four-day trip to Zante. </p>

<p>Seven friends who had gone to the Greek island the week before also caught Covid.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old, from Shildon in County Durham, is now self-isolating in his bedroom at home because he lives with his 77-year-old grandmother Maureen.</p>

<p>‘It was stupid,’ he told MailOnline. ‘It really wasn’t worth it – I feel dead guilty.</p>

<p>‘It’s really bad out there. Something like this could start a second wave of coronavirus. I don’t think people should go.</p>

<p>‘I guess the message is, don’t go on holiday and if you have to, have a more chilled out holiday with no night clubs.’</p>

<p>The warehouse worker paid Jet2.com £250 for a four-day package holiday to Zante, flying from Newcastle on 22nd August.</p>

<p>Despite government advice to avoid large gatherings and maintain social distancing, Jamie and his two friends Adam Scott, also 20, and Adam Pybus, 19, behaved as if it were business as usual.</p>

<p>He confessed: ‘It was just a normal lads’ holiday.</p>

<p>‘We tried to fit everything in in four days. We hired a boat, went to the water park, went on jet-skis and did loads of fun stuff.’</p>

<p>Jamie said: ‘It wasn’t that strict. The clubs were packed. People go to the beach afterwards because they want something to do and there are hundreds and hundreds of people'</p>

<p>‘They [Greek authorities] put new rules in where you can’t stand up in clubs anymore, but there were people standing and the clubs were getting fined so they started shutting earlier.</p>

<p>‘It wasn’t that strict. The clubs were packed. People go to the beach afterwards because they want something to do and there are hundreds and hundreds of people.</p>

<p>‘There was no enforcement, nothing. Looking back now I wish I’d been more careful.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t think it was that bad over there, you didn’t have to quarantine, it looked as though there weren’t that many cases, so I thought it would be fine, but obviously not. It’s not safe.’</p>

<p>Jamie did not develop any symptoms while on the Greek island but got tested upon his return and discovered he had contracted the virus.</p>

<p>He explained: ‘A group of my friends had been to Zante the week before,' he explained.</p>

<p>‘There were seven of them and they all tested positive while I was there. They said it was getting bad out there and told us to get a test when we got back.’</p>

<p>He added: ‘Just a few people coming back from Zante with Covid could spark an entire county getting shut down here.</p>

<p>‘It’s just not safe. My advice would be to anyone coming back from there to get a test just in case.</p>

<p>‘If I didn’t know I had it, I could be walking about now with Coronavirus.’</p>
