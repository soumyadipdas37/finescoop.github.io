<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man arrested following the fatal shooting of police sergeant Matt Ratana on suspicion of supplying a firearm was released on bail today.</p>

<p>The man from Norwich was bailed until October as police searches continued at the home of alleged gunman Louis De Zoysa, 23, in Norbury, South London.</p>

<p>Detectives investigating the murder of Sergeant Ratana at Croydon custody centre last Friday have also been searching an area in Banstead, Surrey.</p>

<p>But they are yet to speak to De Zoysa, who is in a critical condition in hospital after he shot himself as he opened fire with a revolver while handcuffed behind his back.</p>

<p>The Banstead location includes access to several derelict buildings and more than 30 acres of land, with police saying the 'complex' search will take days to complete. </p>

<p>The custody centre remains a crime scene, while searches in Pollards Hill, where De Zoysa was arrested, and a location in central London have also been carried out.</p>

<p>It came as further details about De Zoysa emerged yesterday, including that he excelled at the Catholic John Fisher School in Purley, South London.</p>

<p>De Zoysa, whose school yearbook entry said he was 'good with weapons', went on to study mechanical engineering at University College London.</p>

<p>Friends said he was very intelligent but dropped out after just a year. De Zoysa and his four siblings were brought up by their translator mother and yoga teacher father.</p>

<p>Friends have previously spoken of their middle-class lifestyle and his younger brother now attends Oxford University.</p>

<p>Police searches have been taking place at Banstead in Surrey as well as in South London</p>

<p>Forensics continue their search of the De Zoysa family home today in Norbury, South London</p>

<p>Police vehicles and officers at the scene in Norbury continue to investigate the murder today</p>

<p>But one neighbour who knew the family well said the De Zoysa house was notorious in the street for loud arguments and aggressive dogs which were bred for money.</p>

<p>Speaking yesterday, the source said that his father Channa, from Sri Lanka, struggled to hold down regular employment.</p>

<p>The neighbour also claimed to have witnessed arguments which spilled out into the street.</p>

<p>It backs up reports that De Zoysa's British mother, Elizabeth, took out a restraining order against her husband in 2015. This was withdrawn last year when they reconciled.</p>

<p>The neighbour added that she filed a police report when De Zoysa was in his early teens, claiming to have heard gun shots from the garden of the property. </p>

<p>Sergeant Matiu Ratana (pictured with his partner Sue) was allegedly shot by a 23-year-old man who was detained for possession of ammunition at Croydon custody centre in South London</p>

<p>'Some neighbours felt bullied by them,' she said. 'The family were known because their dogs would bark all the time. They were like wild guard dogs.</p>

<p>'The family had some really bad problems. I would often hear loud arguments with very strong language. '</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police officer Sgt Ratana was shot when De Zoysa, who had been arrested for alleged possession of ammunition and Class B drugs in south London, was brought into his police station in Croydon.</p>

<p>Despite being cuffed and searched outside, the suspect is believed to have smuggled a revolver inside and shot Sgt Ratana as he took his temperature to comply with Covid regulations.</p>

<p>Five shots were fired at 2.15am on Friday, including one which left De Zoysa in hospital. Detectives have as yet been unable to speak to him. </p>

<p>Tributes have been left to Sgt Ratana including rugby shirts and flowers in Croydon yesterday</p>

<p>A year from retirement, the inspirational police officer (pictured) had thrown himself into coaching and was looking forward to being able to focus fully on nurturing future rugby stars</p>

<p>Members of the East Grinstead rugby club in West Sussex where Sgt Ratana was head coach linked arms as they laid his club jacket on the pitch and held a minute's silence on Sunday</p>

<p>Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy said: 'We've traced a number of witnesses who have been able to contribute significant information.'</p>

<p>Girlfriend Su Bushby, 44, who lived with Sgt Ratana in Worthing, Sussex, has called him her 'gentle giant' and 'soulmate'.</p>

<p>A fund in his memory has been set up by the Metropolitan Police's Hayes Sports Club.</p>

<p>The New Zealand-born officer joined Scotland Yard in 1991 and was head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club. His grown-up son lives overseas.</p>

<p>Officers in his home country yesterday honoured Sgt Ratana with a haka as part of their Police Remembrance Day.</p>

<p>And today, New Zealand Rugby said in a statement: 'Our thoughts are with the family and friends of #SgtMattRatana whose loss is being felt hard across the rugby and police community in both the UK and New Zealand. Rest In Peace Sergeant Matt.' </p>
