<p>Jerry Falwell Jr's showed up to Liberty University campus smelling of alcohol and once accidentally sent a nude photo of his wife to numerous people, including his own son, it has been claimed. </p>

<p>The disgraced former head of the Christian college resigned last month after his wife's affair with Giancarlo Granda, 29, emerged. </p>

<p>Granda says he had a six-year affair with Becki that began when they met in Miami in 2012, when he was just 20 and was working as a pool boy. He claims that Jerry knew about it and watched them had sex the first time then continued to give his blessing to the affair for years afterwards. </p>

<p>Their seemingly friendly relationship fell apart when he tried to be bought out of the Miami gay-friendly hostel that the Falwells bought and put him in charge of. </p>

<p>Then, Granda threatened to 'go kamikaze' and share details publicly. </p>

<p>To get ahead of him, Jerry released a statement claiming Granda had had an affair with his wife but that it was brief and he had nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>Afterwards, he stepped down from Liberty - the ultra-religious university that his father, Jerry 'Big Jerry' Falwell Sr., founded. </p>

<p>Now, Liberty has launched an investigation into Falwell's conduct at the helm of the school.</p>

<p>According to The Wall Street Journal, administrators say Falwell showed up to campus drunk. </p>

<p>He also accidentally once sent a racy photograph of his wife to administrators at a football game, and to his son, they claimed. He denied the claims in the Journal.  </p>

<p>In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Granda said that the couple had been harassing him ever since he spoke out. </p>

<p>Granda says the couple have been 'harassing' him since he spoke out</p>

<p>'[They] have been relentlessly harassing me and people close to me,' he complained. </p>

<p>He said he'd been afraid 'for years' to speak out because of how the couple may respond. </p>

<p>Liberty tells all of its students that sex should only be between a man and his wife, and that sobriety should be practiced. </p>

<p>Falwell Jr's behavior during his tenure at the school is now under a microscope and Granda claims it does not fall inline with the university's teachings. </p>

<p>'Their lavish lifestyle consisted of heavy drinking and going to nightclubs, which is strictly prohibited by the honor code that they expect everyone else to follow,' he said. </p>

<p>'Everyone at Liberty University treated the Falwells like a royal family. </p>

<p>'Faculty, the Board, legal team and friends within the trusted 'inner circle' all looked the other way out of fear,' he said. </p>

<p>The Falwell family has denied any and all wrongdoing. </p>

<p>They say Granda has been trying to extort them for years and that he is fabricating most of his claims. </p>
