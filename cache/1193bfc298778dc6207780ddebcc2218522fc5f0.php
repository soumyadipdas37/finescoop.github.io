<p>In June, the Duke of Cambridge took to the Kensington Palace official Twitter account and penned: 'So good to have football back, we have all missed it! Thank you to everyone involved for your hard work in making it happen. W' (pictured)</p>

<p>In May, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge changed the display names on their Instagram and Twitter accounts.</p>

<p>While the social media display names for the <?php echo e('@'); ?>Kensingtonroyal handle used to be Kensington Palace, Prince William and Kate Middleton changed them to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.</p>

<p>And fans from across the globe took to social media to praise the decision - with many adding it feels more 'personal' and 'appropriate.'</p>

<p>'I got used to 'Kensington Palace,' but the new name is probably more appropriate,' wrote one, while a second penned: 'I feel it a little bit more personal.'</p>

<p>A third added: 'They've really been doing phenomenal on social media!!' while a further wrote: 'I like that - comes across as more personal!'</p>

<p>The Kensington Royal Twitter account was created in September 2014 and initially represented Prince William, Kate and Prince Harry.</p>

<p>They launched their shared Instagram account a year later - with the first post published being an engagement carried out by Prince Harry.</p>

<p>But following Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding in May 2018, the then-newly weds launched their own <?php echo e('@'); ?>sussexroyal Instagram account - which is now inactive - but they opted for the display name 'The Duke and Duchess of Sussex.'</p>
