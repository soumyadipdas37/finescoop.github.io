<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Snitches are swamping the police non-emergency number with complaints about people flouting the rule of six - forcing senior officers to man the phones with more staff.</p>

<p>Senior ministers, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, have urged Brits to dob in their neighbours if they catch them flouting lockdown rules.</p>

<p>Speaking to Sky News last week, Ms Patel said: 'I'm rarely at home but if I saw something that I thought was inappropriate then, quite frankly, I would call the police,' she told Sky News.</p>

<p>She added: 'It's not dobbing in neighbours, it's all about us taking personal responsibility.'</p>

<p>A week after making the claims, police forces say their local 101 lines have been inundated with calls.</p>

<p>In other coronavirus news today: </p>

<p>Police are struggling to cope with a flood of complaints over people potentially flouting lockdown rules - but some calls have just been neighbours with a pre-existing grudge</p>

<p>Senior police officers have told The Times that forces were having to put additional staff on their phone lines because call numbers had suddenly increased.  </p>

<p>They claim that many members of the public were only calling to report minor rule breaks, or sometimes were only calling because of an ongoing grudge against their neighbours.  </p>

<p>A senior officer told the paper: 'There are discussions about how the 101 system can cope, and whether increased resources need to be looked at across the board. We don't want a situation where people calling about Covid-19 breaches are blocking others from getting through about other serious crimes.'  </p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he would snitch if he found out someone was not self-isolating when they should have been, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has asked neighbours to only call police if there is a large party going on.</p>

<p>When Mr Hancock was asked by Sky News' Sophie Ridge whether he would report a neighbour, he replied: 'Yes, and everybody should.'</p>

<p>His comment came after Boris Johnson had told The Sun: 'I have never much been in favour of sneak culture, myself.</p>

<p>'What people should do in the first instance obviously if they are concerned is raise it with their friends and neighbours.'  </p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel has encouraged the public to complain to police if they see people flouting lockdown rules</p>

<p>Police in Gwent say their non-emergency line has been flooded with people asking questions about Covid-19 regulations.</p>

<p>Chief Superintendent Mark Hobrough told the South Wales Argus: 'We're very much trying to point people to the Welsh government and Public Health Wales sites for up-to-date advice and answers to frequently asked questions. </p>

<p>'It will help us deal with policing demands rather than be tied up in other ways.</p>

<p>'Police are being encouraged by the government to issue more fines because so many members of the public were flouting restrictions.' </p>
