<p>Cheeky: He's The Block's no-nonsense foreman, but on Monday's episode, Keith Schleiger (pictured) made an X-rated joke that left one of the show's contestants lost for words</p>

<p>After coming in to inspect the work on George's master bedroom, Keith noticed the home's original ornate ceiling was lying on the floor.</p>

<p>'You're doing demo, too. Now, I presume you want to keep this,' Keith told him after they'd carefully removed the ceiling to ensure it remained intact.</p>

<p>He added: 'What happens if something falls on it and it just breaks it, or if you stand on it?'  </p>

<p>Naughty: Without missing a beat, Keith cheekily asked George Bragias (pictured left) if he had 'trouble getting it up', after noticing his ceiling lying on the floor</p>

<p>George then explained that while he'd tried to move the ceiling off the floor, it had proven to be 'impossible'.</p>

<p>'We're gonna need six, seven guys to get this, so it's going to have to stay here at least so I can try and get it up,' George explained.</p>

<p>Without missing a beat, Keith asked: 'Do you have trouble getting it up?'</p>

<p>'We're gonna need six, seven guys to get this, so it's going to have to stay here at least so I can try and get it up,' George explained of the ceiling</p>

<p>'Yeah,' responded George, before realising what he meant, prompting him to burst out laughing.</p>

<p>A stony-faced Keith then slowly turned his head up to look at the ceiling, as George continued to laugh at his racy joke.</p>

<p>The scene then cut away without any further explanation, but it was obvious what Keith had meant by the double entendre. </p>

<p>Catching up: While it took the 33-year-old electrician a moment to register what Keith had actually meant by the comment, he was left red-faced by the raunchy remark</p>
