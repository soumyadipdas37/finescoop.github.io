<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dr Katarina Arandjelovic copped a whopping parking fine in August </p>

<p>Melbourne workers fined by parking inspectors in the deserted CBD are still being told to pay up or fight it out in court. </p>

<p>The City Of Melbourne is writing to workers who asked for their fines to be waived during the opening weeks of the Stage Four lockdown that their fines will not be withdrawn. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia revealed on August 3 - the first day of Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown - that Melbourne's dreaded 'Grey Ghosts' had been attaching $83 fines to the few workers it caught overstaying their allotted times in the near empty CBD. </p>

<p>During Melbourne's first lockdown in March, the council lifted parking restrictions altogether, allowing motorists to stay in parking spots as long as they liked in any 'green zone'. </p>

<p>The same happened in Sydney, Brisbane and every other city in Australia.   </p>

<p>But people identifying as essential workers - including this Daily Mail reporter - that have asked the council to withdraw their fines have been told to pay them. </p>

<p>Parking inspectors had swarmed on illegal parking at the beginning of the lockdown amid confusion about if inspectors were regarded as essential workers. </p>

<p>Many of those fined included constructions workers who had been unable to park in private car parks, which had closed at the time.  </p>

<p>After working 56 hours over four days and taking care of 'some of the state's sickest patients,' Dr Arandjelovic finished her gruelling shift at 10pm to find a $99 fine (pictured) on her windshield</p>

<p>City Of Melbourne spokeswoman Jem Wilson said the fine ought to have been further reviewed. </p>

<p>'Our investigation found our team should have taken further steps to request information from the customer before making their decision,' she said.</p>

<p>'We acknowledge that these additional steps take more time, but it is important we follow due process.</p>

<p>'We treat each request for a review on a case-by-base basis, and will review this request again.'</p>

<p>The council declined to comment when put to it that the review had only been made because the council's media team had intervened. </p>

<p>Council worker 'Tony' told Daily Mail Australia that only medical workers would be exempt from the fines already dished out by the council.</p>

<p> 'There is a potential difference between someone who as an essential worker is able to work versus what the City Of Melbourne meet as a front line medical worker,' he said.</p>

<p>Tony admitted the media request had 'generated an opportunity to review the fine again' after council earlier had refused to withdraw the initial fine without even asking what the recipient did for a living.    </p>

<p>Parking inspectors had continued to fine workers for weeks of Stage Four lockdown before the council succumbed to community pressure to stop its penny pinching antics on an already devastated city. </p>

<p>The council, headed by Mayor Sally Capp, only backflipped on fining Melburnians after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews hit out at parking inspectors for fining essential workers across the city. </p>

<p>Addressing the media on August 11, Mr Andrews said it made no sense that parking inspectors continued to roam the streets of Melbourne fining people. </p>

<p>Parking inspectors continued to wander the streets of Melbourne fining confused and vulnerable Melburnians in their darkest hours last month</p>

<p>On August 3, as an essential worker who had worked through the previous COVID 19 lockdown, I was under the misguided impression that restrictions may have been lifted on this day as it was the beginning of lockdown. I parked in a green zone only for a short period of time to perform my duties as an essential worker and received the fine.</p>

<p>The city was practically empty and there were empty parking spaces lining the streets. I have never received a fine before and park daily in Melbourne. </p>

<p>I have since paid for parking when entering the city in the days that followed. During COVID i have endured a significant pay cut and ask that my previous good record within the city be recognised and the fine withdrawn. </p>

<p>Failing this I request you list my matter to be heard before the Melbourne Magistrates' Court.</p>

<p>'Should parking inspectors be an essential worker at the moment? We have a lot of other industries shut down completely. It doesn't seem to make sense,' he said.</p>

<p>The premier's comments followed revelations Dr Katarina Arandjelovic, an anaesthetics registrar at Royal Melbourne Hospital's intensive care unit, was among those fined by Melbourne parking inspectors. </p>

<p>After working 56 hours over four days and taking care of 'some of the state's sickest patients', Dr Arandjelovic finished her gruelling shift at 10pm to find a $99 fine on her windshield. </p>

<p>Taking to social media, the doctor branded the inspectors 'perverse' for slapping her with a massive fine while she was at work battling to save lives. </p>

<p>'It is not easy, but every single person in that building is working their butt off right now. It is inspiring. We make sacrifices and turn up - day in, day out, to serve you,' she said.</p>

<p>'So I guess <?php echo e('@'); ?>cityofmelbourne and <?php echo e('@'); ?>SallyCapp, slapping fines on our cars is one hell of a thank you.'</p>

<p>In response, the City of Melbourne tweeted, 'vehicles parked in residential parking areas with red signs are still subject to restrictions'—which was met with a torrent of angry replies. </p>

<p>To quell the community response, on August 14 the City of Melbourne withdrew the fine and later announced the council would be issuing 5000 additional temporary parking permits for frontline workers and scrapped fining motorists parked in ordinary Green Zones. </p>

<p>Dr Arandjelovic issued an emotional plea to parking inspectors to avoid from hospitals when handing out fines last month</p>

<p>Those essential workers whose requests to withdraw are rejected are warned they face a $124 fine instead of $83 should the matter progress to court. </p>

<p>The City of Melbourne, which includes the CBD and suburbs like Carlton, Docklands and Southbank, collected $93 million in parking fees and fines collected in 2018-19. </p>

<p>In an act of kindness, the council said it would waive fines issued on August 6 and 7 due to the closure of off-street commercial car parks. </p>

<p>However, it remains unclear if the council has made good on this promise.  </p>

<p>Before lifting the parking restrictions, Mr Andrews said there had been a massive reduction in the number of people parking in the city since stage-four lockdown was introduced.</p>

<p>'I think the traffic data I reported to you before was in the order of - well, it is down 40, 50 per cent at least, if not more,' he said at the time. </p>

<p>'They don't work for the Victorian Government, but their status can be determined by us, and I'm more than happy to chase that up.'</p>

<p>Mr Andrews said the lockdown had offered a new meaning to the term 'essential worker'. </p>

<p>'Given the meaning of the term has been fundamentally changed throughout the course of the year, there are a lot of workers in the economy we know are essential now - we perhaps didn't regard them that way - but we know they are,' he said. </p>

<p>The decision to suspend minor parking fines was welcomed by many CBD residents such as Chriss Mannix, who questioned whether parking inspectors should fall under the category of 'essential'.</p>

<p>'A question I would love to have answered is why parking officers are considered to be essential workers when an accountant can’t work alone in their own office. I can’t see how they fit in the framework provided,' he told CBD News last week.</p>

<p>Another CBD resident, Lisa Moses, said that it had been disheartening to see fines still being handed out during lockdown.</p>

<p>'I saw one putting a ticket on someone’s window in City Road the other day. I too wondered why they were still out walking around, revenue raising no doubt. And there are so many car parks empty. But still out trying to find the odd one to fine,' Ms Moses said.</p>
