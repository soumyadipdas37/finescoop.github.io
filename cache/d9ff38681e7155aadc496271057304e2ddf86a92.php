<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man's romantic proposal took an unfortunate turn after he was thrown from an out-of-control boat and into a lake mid-way into his 'fairy-tale' gesture.</p>

<p>A hilarious video shows an unnamed man climbing across the back of a stationary boat to propose to his fiancée-to-be, who is sitting on a neighbouring boat.</p>

<p>The woman stands in shock with her hands over her face as he moves the boats together, pulls out the ring and she realises he is going to pop the big question. </p>

<p>The man filming can be heard saying 'it's like a fairy-tale' as the brave man balances unsteadily on the back of the boat.</p>

<p>A man's 'fairy-tale' proposal takes an unfortunate turn as an out-of-control boat moves forward and sends the groom-to-be flying into the lake</p>

<p>But the romantic proposal takes an unexpected turn as the groom-to-be seemingly hits the throttle and sends the boat flying forwards while he tries to kiss and embrace his partner.</p>

<p>The woman quite literally falls head-over-heels as she flies into the air and the boat crashes into the pier, the video footage shows.</p>

<p>The perfect moment is unfortunately ruined as the man loses his balance and falls off the back of the neighbouring boat, taking an unwelcome plunge into the lake. </p>

<p>In the footage, his partner's foot narrowly avoids his head as he is swept off his feet and desperately tries to cling on and stop the out-of-control boat.</p>

<p>Thankfully the unnamed woman still said yes despite her partner's unfortunate marriage proposal failure.</p>

<p>Amanda Kuehl uploaded the hilarious video to TikTok on Sunday, where it has since been viewed more than two million times.</p>

<p>Amused social media viewers shared a laugh at the unfortunate man's expense as they posted comments on the video. </p>
