<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After enduring the stress of the recent exams fiasco, one of the brightest athletics talents in the country, Amy Hunt, will take on her first significant test as a senior sprinter at the British Championships this weekend.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old, who holds the world Under 18 record for the 200m, revealed she was among the thousands of A-level students to have their grades downgraded by algorithm last month. </p>

<p>However, she was given a reprieve by Cambridge University, where she will juggle an English degree from October with a campaign to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics.</p>

<p>Amy Hunt, who holds the world Under 18 record for the 200m, is going to study at Cambridge</p>

<p>The starting point of that two-fronted challenge will come on Friday, when she contests the 100m at the British Championships behind closed doors in Manchester – her first outdoor national championships at senior level.</p>

<p>Hunt, who will be second quickest on paper in Manchester, is confident that her studies will not reduce her potential to reach Tokyo and then make a subsequent impact at the Games. </p>

<p>She said: ‘I live my life very chaotically at times, with academia and sport, and I like to think I thrive under that pressure and embrace it. The Olympic postponement is a very good opportunity for me.</p>

<p>Hunt (L) is confident that her studies will not reduce her potential to reach Tokyo Olympics</p>

<p>‘It allows me to feel I can potentially make the Olympics and if I do, I can be competitive there - I'm not just there to have my first experience.’</p>

<p>On the exams saga, she said: ‘I initially got marked down a grade but I was very lucky to get into my first choice uni. On results day, I was waiting for UCAS to update for about 50 minutes and having all these nerves as the page kept crashing. In the end it was complete euphoria.’</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a decision on the new head coach of UK Athletics will be made this week. Stephen Maguire is a narrow favourite for the post from Peter Eriksson.</p>
