<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An elderly hiker has been reunited with her husband after being lost on Queensland's Fraser Island for three nights.  </p>

<p>Madeleine Nowak, 73, was found alive and well on Sunday morning after she became separated from a tour group on the island's Great Walk on Thursday.</p>

<p>After spending three nights sleeping rough, she walked from the scrub onto Eastern Beach, about 7km from where she got lost, and approached campers for help.</p>

<p>Acting Inspector Brooke Flood said Dr Nowak's reunion with her husband was 'extremely emotional'.  </p>

<p>Elderly hiker Madeleine Nowak, 73, (pictured) was rescued and reunited with her husband on Sunday after being lost for three day's on Queensland's Fraser Island</p>

<p>'Everybody involved in the search effort was just so relieved. It's been a really, really long three days,' she told reporters.  </p>

<p>LifeFlight's Brent Morgan said Dr Nowak left the trail after coming across a fallen tree on the track.</p>

<p>She decided to go around it before becoming disoriented and unable to rediscover the path.</p>

<p>'The last few days she's been heading east,' Mr Morgan said. </p>

<p>A land, air and sea search and rescue commenced on Thursday evening and continued throughout Friday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Dr Nowak got lost after coming across a fallen tree while with a hiking group on Fraser Island's Great Walk on Thursday</p>

<p>Those searches were halted at night and restarted each morning at first light.</p>

<p>Dr Nowak knew air crews were looking for her but was unable to wave them down in difficult terrain.</p>

<p>'The bushland's very dense and very thick,' Insp Flood said.</p>

<p>'The missing person actually said she heard choppers overhead but because of the canopy she just couldn't get their attention.'</p>

<p>Dr Nowak is believed to have walked 6-7km from where she was last seen, making it harder for authorities to pin down her whereabouts.</p>

<p>Police have reminded adventurers to stay put if they become lost or disoriented to aid rescue efforts.</p>

<p>'If you stay as near as possible to where you have gone missing, the chances of you being located during a search dramatically increase,' Insp Flood said.</p>

<p>Dr Nowak is in good health and expected to be released from Hervey Bay Hospital after undergoing precautionary checks. </p>

<p>Dr Nowak survived on food and water rations before emerging onto the Eastern Beach, about 7km from where she got lost, and approached some campers for help</p>
