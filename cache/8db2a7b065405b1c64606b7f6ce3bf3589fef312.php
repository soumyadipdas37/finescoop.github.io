<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has called for the Premier League to 'step up to the plate' and provide financial support for EFL clubs through the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>The EFL says its clubs stand to lose £200million this season without crowds, having already lost £50m last season. There are fears that without crowds some EFL clubs will disappear.</p>

<p>Dowden told Sky News' Sophy Ridge On Sunday: 'We stand ready to support clubs because they are such an important part of our local community. </p>

<p>Culture secretary Oliver Dowden has urged Premier League clubs to support EFL teams</p>

<p>Dowden said that he expects a financial support deal to be finalised later this week </p>

<p>'The first thing we need to look to is the Premier League and I've been in contact with them this week.</p>

<p>'We're all agreed the Premier League needs to step up to the plate and they're having intensive discussions with the EFL over how they can support those clubs.</p>

<p>'I have been speaking with the Premier League and I was very clear that we expect the Premier League to support the EFL.'</p>

<p>Dowden, in a separate interview on BBC's Andrew Marr Show, said: 'The Premier League are working closely with the EFL to see how they can support them. They are having productive conversations and I am hopeful they will reach a deal this week.'</p>

<p>The EFL said its clubs stand to lose £200million without crowds after losing £50m last season</p>

<p>Governing bodies across a range of sports have spoken out since Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday that the planned reintroduction of spectators to sports venues from October 1 had been scrapped due to fears of a second wave of coronavirus infections.</p>

<p>Dowden said the Premier League will meet on Tuesday to discuss the way forward now that the Government has effectively ruled out any fans attending matches until March.</p>

<p>In his Sophy Ridge on Sunday interview he added: 'The direction is clear, we understand the Premier League needs to play its part.</p>

<p>'I'm in close consultation with them and I'm hopeful they will be able to reach a deal and provide that level of support.'</p>

<p>Asked if crowds would return by the end of the season, Dowden replied: 'I would desperately love that to happen and we keep the situation under constant review.</p>

<p>Dowden also said the decision on when fans can return to games will be constantly reviewed </p>

<p>'We are also investigating the use of new technology, working with the clubs who have done a fantastic job until now.</p>

<p>'If it's all possible of course I would like it to happen, but, in this rapidly moving situation with the virus, we just need to exercise a little bit of caution which is what we've done in relation to October 1.</p>

<p>'Most people would agree against this backdrop of rapidly rising cases now is not the time to bring back crowds.'</p>
