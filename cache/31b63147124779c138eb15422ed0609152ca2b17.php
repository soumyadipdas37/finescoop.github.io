<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leyton Orient have announced their club shop has raised over an incredible £20,000 in shirt sales since Tuesday morning after fans have been donating children's kits.</p>

<p>The League Two outfit's owner, Nigel Travis, told the Evening Standard that the club raised quadruple their usual shirt sales on Tuesday largely thanks to Tottenham fans playing their part.</p>

<p>And on Wednesday morning, Orient expressed their huge gratitude to everyone that has helped out, before outlining the process for supporters to donate children's kits.</p>

<p>Tottenham and England striker Harry Kane agreed to sponsor Leyton Orient's 2020-2021 kits</p>

<p>Orient tweeted: 'The club shop has done over £20k of sales since yesterday morning! No words for your generosity, Spurs fans.'</p>

<p>The donations will go to Whipps’ Cross Hospital, as well as Haven House Children’s Hospice - two of the club's partners from Harry Kane's shirt sponsorship.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Orient have announced that all money they receive in delivery charges will be donated to the Justin Edinburgh 3 Foundation. </p>

<p>The Tottenham and England talisman had agreed to sponsor Orient's kits for the 2020-21 campaign.  </p>

<p>The League Two outfit expressed their gratitude after the incredible shirt sales on Tuesday</p>

<p>Kane, who enjoyed his first taste of senior football during a loan at Orient in 2011, made the kind gesture back in May to help both his former club and charities in need during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The news comes after Orient's home Carabao Cup clash against Premier League outfit Tottenham was called off after a coronavirus outbreak within the League Two side's camp.</p>

<p>Orient spent Tuesday trying to convince the EFL that the game could go ahead at at their Breyer Group Stadium, but the plug was pulled just two hours before the scheduled kick-off after 17 players from the League Two club tested positive. </p>

<p>Orient’s determination to play the game stemmed partly from the fact it was due to be televised by Sky Sports, earning them £150,000, and they are adamant the game should be played at a later date. </p>
