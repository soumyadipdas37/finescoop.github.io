<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dog The Bounty Hunter and his new fianceé are opening up about their relationship and upcoming nuptials in an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV. </p>

<p>Sitting next to his new fianceé Francie, Dog gushed about how cupid shot him when he least expected it and how both of them connected by sharing the pain of being widowed. </p>

<p>'I'm a widower and she's a widow so the connection started there,' Dog told DailyMailTV host Thomas Roberts. 'I spoke with her because her husband passed six months before my former wife and she had been through stuff,  so I was asking for advice and all the sudden cupid shot me.'</p>

<p>The widower, 67, got down on one knee in May at a romantic dinner at their home in Colorado, ten months after the death of his wife, Beth, from throat cancer. Francie's husband Bob had past away six months prior.  </p>

<p>'We didn't expect it,' Dog said. </p>

<p>'It was God for sure,' Francie added. </p>

<p>Dog The Bounty Hunter and his new fianceé Francie spoke to DailyMailTV about their relationship and upcoming nuptials in an exclusive interview</p>

<p> Dog gushed about how cupid shot him when he least expected it and how both of them connected by sharing the pain of being widowed</p>

<p>The widower, 67, got down on one knee in May at a romantic dinner at their home in Colorado, ten months after the death of his wife, Beth, from throat cancer. Francie's husband Bob had past away six months prior </p>

<p>Dog initially vowed that he would never remarry after losing the love of his life last year. </p>

<p>When asked what changed for Dog, he said: 'Well, Francie is  a Christian and unless you marry you can't uh....' he drifted off, as Francie nudged him and said 'be nice'. </p>

<p>As far as the wedding, the couple have a few dates in mind but are struggling to invite as many people as they would like due to COVID restrictions </p>

<p>'What changed was I had no idea I was going to meet someone like Francie because a rancher was not in my black book,' Dog said. </p>

<p>'And when I did, she put down some rules - like you must go to church, you got to start eating grass and weeds, and you got to quit smoking, and you got to quit using the A-word every other sentence. And you just gotta get your heart rate because maybe someday you'll be gone.'   </p>

<p>Dog said his late wife Beth is up in heaven laughing at all of those restrictions. </p>

<p>Francie said he's checked off all of her requirements and he wears a couple of  nicotine patches. He said he's gone down from three packs a day to just one. </p>

<p>Francie said she feels she has her late husband Bob's blessing from above.</p>

<p>'Bob and I had a lot of conversations before he went about moving on and what that looked like and what he wanted,' Francie said. 'I didn't know who Duane [Dog] was when I met him. I actually think Bob is in heaven laughing that it's Dog The Bounty Hunter that God brought into my life.'</p>

<p>'I think Bob would be very happy about where I'm at and who Duane is in my life and how we've been walking alongside each other.' </p>

<p>Beth Chapman died at 51 in May 2019. Dog had vowed never to remarry, but was struck by cupid when he met Francie </p>

<p>'I think Bob would be very happy about where I'm at and who Duane is in my life and how we've been walking alongside each other,' Francie said of her late husband. She is pictured with her late husband Bob who dies six months before Dog's wife </p>

<p>As far as the upcoming nuptials, the couple are planning for several dates while trying to keep it safe. </p>

<p>'We are talking about a few different dates and we are starting to plan. It's a little difficult with all of the COVID going on or trying to have more than 20 people in a place,' Francie said. </p>

<p>'Dwayne has that many kids!' she joked.  </p>

<p>'I want to leave it open,' Dog said. 'I want to have a wedding that anyone can come for free and try to set a record. So we're negotiating there. It seems like no.'</p>

<p>Dog also spoke about his new platform called Dog Unleashed.   </p>

<p>'Unleashed means exactly that, there wont be someone there saying ''oh you cant do that''', he said. </p>

<p>'We aren't going after bail jumpers anymore, we’re going after the worst of the worst - rapists, murderers, child porn child molestation, wife beaters,' he said. </p>

<p>'We got one guy right now, it might be episode one, who beat up this lady really bad and it was his girlfriend's mother and when the girlfriend walked in he also beat her and put her in the hospital, so I think he needs a little Dog awakening.</p>

<p>The new platform Dog Unleashed launches on January 1.    </p>
