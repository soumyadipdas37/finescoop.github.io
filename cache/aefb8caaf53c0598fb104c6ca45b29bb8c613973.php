<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crystal Palace have launched a £25 million bid for Liverpool striker Rhian Brewster as a host of Premier League clubs battle it out for his signature.</p>

<p>Palace's bid is comprised of £19m plus £6m in add ons, while there is also a £37m buy-back clause as part of the deal. </p>

<p>That would mean Liverpool have first refusal on Brewster if Palace decide to sell the striker in the future. </p>

<p>Crystal Palace have emerged as the favourites to sign Rhian Brewster after making £25m bid</p>

<p>Brewster is highly rated by Liverpool but the club can't offer him regular first team football</p>

<p>Brewster is in demand after scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances during a loan spell at Swansea City last season, which included several stunning strikes.</p>

<p>Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is an admirer of Brewster's talents but can't promise him regular minutes with Roberto Firmino, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah his first choice attacking trio.</p>

<p>Klopp handed the 20-year-old a rare substitute appearance in extra-time during the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal, but Brewster missed his penalty in the shoot-out.</p>

<p>That could now be his last appearance in a Reds shirt, with Liverpool accepting that his departure may offer the best solution for all parties.  </p>

<p>Klopp may also have to raise cash after the club spent £66m on Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota last week, with Brewster one of his most saleable assets.</p>

<p>The Reds have been frugal in the transfer market in recent summers prior to their recent outlay and will be wary of balancing the books as Premier League clubs continue to play behind closed doors.</p>

<p> Liverpool will hope Palace's opening offer will spark a bidding war between Premier League clubs, with Sheffield United also keen on the striker. </p>

<p>Reports elsewhere have also credited up to four other top flight teams with an interest in Brewster, with Newcastle United and Brighton considering bids.</p>
