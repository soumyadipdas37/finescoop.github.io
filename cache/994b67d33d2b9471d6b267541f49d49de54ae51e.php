<p>'What?! Typical Juliette. Here we go. Every time, without fail. As soon as I heard my name, I was, like, "Here we frickin' go again,"' Roxi lashed out.   </p>

<p>Roxi then accused Juliette of throwing her under the bus, amid Bec's arrival.   </p>

<p>'Don't pull that card with me, mate, 'cause that is a load of sh<em>t! Go stir up sh</em>t with someone else, Juliette, 'cause I don't want a bar of it tonight,' Roxi said. </p>

<p>'Once again, I'm simply pointing out some truths and Roxi's losing her flippin' mind,' Juliette said. 'I just speak the truth. It's all on camera!' </p>

<p>The two women are set to go head-to-head when they return to the mansion.  </p>
