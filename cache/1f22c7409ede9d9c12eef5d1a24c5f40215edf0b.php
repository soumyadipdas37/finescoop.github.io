<p>The seaside property, dubbed 'Downtown Abbey of Australia', is about 54 kilometres south of Melbourne and is 63.2 hectares (pictured, the garden's dramatic water feature)</p>

<p>Property agent Michael Keating would not divulge who the buyer was but records show Mr Verrocchi, who is chief executive of the group comprising the Chemist Warehouse and My Chemist chains, placed a caveat on the property on September 24. </p>

<p>A caveat prevents another buyer from registering interest in a property ahead of theirs.</p>

<p>The purchase of the property comes just three months after it was put on the market with the asking price of $40million. </p>

<p>Mr Keating told the Herald Sun the buyer was planning to have the property for his family in the future. </p>

<p>'There is nothing else like it in Australia. You've got 157 acres (63ha) with beach frontage, less than an hour from a capital city that's soon to be Australia's largest. It's a no-brainer.'</p>

<p>The Morning Star Estate was established by Londoner Francis Gillett in the 1860s. He had used it as a 'summer palace' (pictured, the view onto the lush gardens)</p>
