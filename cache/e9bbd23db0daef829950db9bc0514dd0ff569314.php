<p>Back in 2018, Ireland had spoken publicly about her struggles with anorexia and bulimia, explaining: 'I battled with many eating disorders and body issues as a younger girl and it took me a long time to find self love and acceptance!'</p>

<p>'I used to read people’s comments when I first started modeling and anytime anyone told me I was too tall or too fat to have done a job, I would run on a treadmill for the entire duration of at least three episodes of Friday Night Lights that I had on box set.'  </p>
