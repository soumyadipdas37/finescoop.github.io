<p>The 22-year-old was charged with seven offences, including two of assaulting a police officer and one of resisting arrest, following Australia Day celebrations in Sydney.</p>

<p>Officers had claimed the alleged assault took place as they tried to arrest the star, but video footage shown to court shows him 'dreamily' trying to brush off the police and stay asleep.Â </p>

<p>Police alleged they were alerted when Scott was seen acting erratically on Regent Street at Paddington before finding him asleep near Driver Avenue at Moore Park in the early hours of January 27.</p>

<p>In the hours leading up to the incident, Scott posted to social media videos of himself partying with Raiders teammates at The Ivy nightclub in the Sydney CBD.</p>

<p>But in the Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday, prosecutors showed 72 seconds of police bodycam footage showing Scott slumped against a tree when attempts to rouse him failed.</p>

<p>Magistrate Jennifer Giles commented: 'It's drawing a very long frightening bow to argue police can handcuff someone they are trying to wake up while sleeping under a tree.'</p>
