<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David Moyes has done this job before so he knows this is life as a West Ham manager. Even when your side produces a superb performance of tactical acumen and spirited determination, life finds a way to kick you in the teeth.</p>

<p>By contrast, Mikel Arteta seems to have the Midas Touch. Two trophies collected within his first ten months of management and then an evening like this: in a game in which Arsenal were frankly bossed for long periods and in a second half in which West Ham made all the running, Arsenal collected all the points.</p>

<p>It isn’t luck. Arteta has more the one way of playing and counter attack is crucial to this team. So, you can never dismiss Arsenal. Danger always lurks, no matter how pallid they appeared. Even when they seem to lack vigour, they can spring into life and finish you off.</p>

<p>Arsenal came out as 2-1 winners against West Ham United, taking the full six points from their first two Premier League games</p>

<p>West Ham levelled the score through Antonio just before half-time, but Arsenal came back to get another in the second half</p>

<p>Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrate together after they linked up for Arsenal's first goal</p>

<p>So it was here. Having stood firm against a West Ham assault, Bukayo Saka strode forward on 85 minutes. There seemed little danger, but his pass found the clever run of Dani Ceballos and suddenly, despite all their efforts, West ham were exposed.</p>

<p>For substitute Eddie Nketiah had made a similar run and all Ceballos had to do was roll the ball across to finish. It was cruel on West Ham. Moyes, preparing to make a change designed to win the game, could only look on in despair. Such is the fate of the West Ham manager. </p>

<p>For Moyes, there was also the frustration of seeing his West Ham side play extremely well in the opening quarter of the game in taking the game to Arsenal, forcing a series of set pieces and corners and yet find themselves picked apart by the first probing attack Arsenal created.</p>

<p>So they would regret Angelo Ogbonna’s soft header from close range in the fourth minute when Declan Rice’s flick from Aaron Cresswell’s corner presented a fine opportunity. Moyes anguished expression suggested he knew they would.</p>

<p>Arsenal's Alexandre Lacazette and West Ham's Angelo Ogbonna see the funny side after they came together in the game</p>

<p>There was deflected free-kick from Rice and a penalty shout — very optimistic — from Jarrod Bowen. But the point was West Ham were comfortable and Moyes’ tactical plan, matching up Arsenal’s back three, was working just fine.</p>

<p>But Arsenal are a slippery proposition under Arteta. You think you know where the players should be, but they keep popping up in the wrong positions. In a good way, though: Holland at their best rather than England at their worst.</p>

<p>So when attacking, Hector Bellerin would end up on the right wing, Willian drifted inside, Saka joined him to support Alexandre Lacazette, who stayed central, as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang hugged the left wing. Basically, Arteta has reinvented the front five, a homage to Herbert Chapman and Arsenal history.</p>

<p>And when those five combine slickly, they are an extremely troublesome proposition, as West Ham discovered in the 25th minute.</p>

<p>Lacazette heads the ball into the back of the net for the goal following Aubameyang's floated cross in the first half</p>

<p>Saka prodded the ball through space for Aubameyang to run on to. Suddenly West Ham solidity was breached, frantic backtracking was taking place but Aubameyang was away and lifted a perfect cross for Lacazette to head home. Moyes just turned, looked to the ground and sighed, This is how life is as West Ham manager. Just as it was when Gabriel missed his header in the box and instead the ball brushed his arm. We waited for the VAR yet no review came.</p>

<p>Just as it seemed nothing would fall for West Ham and, as half-time approached, they produced their own moment of superb quality, a 45th-minute counter-attack of such speed and incision that Arteta himself would have been proud.Tomas Soucek strode through midfield, released Bowen who in turn moved the ball on with requisite speed to Ryan Fredericks. His cross was speed and direct and the ever game Michail Antonio had bustled his was to the front of the queue to turn it in.</p>

<p>And West Ham, suitably fortified by that, continued to impress in the second half. There was Issa Diop blocking Bukayo Saka’s shot in the 46th minute followed by Arthur Massuaka making strides into the spaces Arsenal leave in their desire to get forward. On this occasion it ended with a wild shot over.</p>

<p>Referee Michael Oliver shows West Ham's Ryan Fredericks a yellow card after a late challenge on Arsenal's Bukayo Saka</p>

<p>But notice had been served and in the 53rd minute, Massuaka went close to opening up Arsenal again, once more pushing into huge areas of space and sending a sweeping cross to the feet of Antonio. Six yards out, the centre forward could not move his feet quick enough, the ball deflected off him allowing Leno to make the vital save. And on the hour, it was a Declan Rice free-kick, which Bowen nodded down for Soucek. He slightly mis-hit his shot but, even so, Gabriel had to make a desperate clearance.</p>

<p>There was a growing confidence about West Ham. And then there was the Massuaka cross in the 66th minute for which Antonio jumped, headed and saw the ball rebound firmly off the bar.</p>

<p>Arsenal were scrambling the ball away and West Ham probing with increasing ferocity. Soucek was outstanding midfield, undiminished by a clash of heads with Grant Xhaka, and Bowen relentless in his harrying of Kolasinac and Saka. Bowen raced away and tried a shot in the 70th minute, when he might have slid Antonio in. Soucek drove the rebound wide.</p>

<p>The narrative arc was clear: this was West Ham’s game to win. Arsenal were pinned back in their half, relying on the odd counter-attack. Arteta has shown he can win that way, so it was not as though they were not a threat. But they had lost control of the game and their authority had been questioned. </p>

<p>Sportsmail's MATT PORTER provided live EPL coverage of Arsenal vs West Ham including score, lineups and build-up.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>That's all she wrote for today. Plenty of goals around the grounds, with more games tomorrow as well. Come back then for all your Premier League updates</p>

<p>West Ham will be disappointed to have come away from this game with nothing. Nevertheless, Arsenal's win streak continues, and they found a way to dig out a result today even though they didn't look nearly as good as they have done over their last few games. </p>

<p>Arsenal go second, just behind Everton, who have scored more goals. Meanwhile, West Ham are down in 18th. They'll be hoping to be much higher than that by the end of the season.</p>

<p>90+4 min: Actually it's Arsenal who come forward. Aubameyang plays it to his left, and then it comes right to Nketiah after a blocked shot, and the sub wins a corner. Fabianski runs all the way out to place it on the corner spot, very helpful. Arsenal take their time in the corner, win a throw in, and that should be that</p>

<p>Final attack coming up?</p>

<p>90+2 min: Everyone's forward for West Ham. Anderson links up with fellow sub Haller, but he has a coming together with Ceballos in the box, and it's a free kick to Arsenal</p>

<p>Four minutes added on, as Aubameyang tries his luck from range. Fabianski easily gathers</p>

<p>And yet more firepower</p>

<p>And an attempt to shore things up at the back for Arteta. </p>

<p>One minute of normal time remaining</p>

<p>Final throw of the dice for Moyes</p>

<p>Elneny was about to come on for Ceballos, but it looks like Arteta has changed his mind after that assist</p>

<p>A classic Arsenal goal, as they walk it into the net!</p>

<p>Ceballos runs into the box on his own as the ball comes through, and cuts it square to sub Nketiah, who's just onside, and the gaping net was at his mercy as the keeper charged out to try and meet Ceballos.</p>

<p>84 min: Half a chance for West Ham there as Soucek leaps through the air to try and get on the end of a cross. It looked like he was about to blast it home, but he either misjudged it or Holding used his body just enough to knock him off course</p>

<p>82 min: Kolasinac gets some space as the ball from Xhaka comes over the top. But he ends up with egg on his face as he stumbles and the ball careens high into the stands</p>

<p>80 min: West Ham have taken their foot off the accelerator over the past few minutes. Is David Moyes now hoping they can hold on for a draw?</p>

<p>76 min: Aubameyang is off to the races, and gets on the end of a long ball. He crosses to Lacazette again, but unlike in the first half, the Frenchman can't get the shot away, and that'll be his last involvement.</p>

<p>Eight shots on goal for West Ham in the second half. Just one for Arsenal...</p>

<p>71 min: West Ham are trying a lot of long range shots rather than going for simpler passes to keep an attack going. A lack of confidence in possession after last week's poor effort against Newcastle perhaps? Still though, the Hammers are looking the more likely of the teams to score at the moment</p>

<p>68 min: Antonio rises high to get a powerful header on goal, and it's off the bar! Leno then makes a mess of catching the ball and West Ham have another go at it, this time blocked. </p>

<p>66 min: Antonio charges forward, and he's got options to his right but he goes for the shot instead, which is blocked. Moments later Xhaka and Soucek have a clash of heads and the ref blows his whistle. Looks like both will be fine to continue, more of a glancing blow for each of them.</p>

<p>60 min: It's Masuaku who's looking lively for West Ham again, putting in another cross. Soucek keeps it alive, tapping it down for Bowen, but he scuffs his shot. It's out for another corner, but now Arsenal come on the break with pace. It comes to nothing though, as Lacazette sends another wayward pass across the pitch.</p>

<p>58 min: West Ham away on the break again with Bowen, but Arsenal get bodies back to quell the danger. The Hammers keep the ball well though, flipping the script and forcing Arsenal to do all the chasing. Fredericks gets to the byline, and wins a corner </p>

<p>55 min: Good work from Ceballos, and he sets Willian away, who drives forward towards the box, lays it off to Lacazette, but the goalscorer can't find a good final ball, and then gives away a free-kick as he tries to get the ball back</p>

<p>53 min: This probably should've been a goal! Masuaku gets a chance to deliver again, and it looks like Gabriel inadvertently does just enough with the back of his leg as he dives in to try and stop two West Ham players as they were about to get on the end of it</p>

<p>53 min: Aubameyang has been playing more of a provider today, happy to sit out to the edges of the box and try and supply his team-mates. Imagine we'll see him drifting more centrally as Arsenal go in search of a winner</p>

<p>51 min: Masuaku skips past his man, but then gets a bit too big for his boots and tries an audacious shot from about 35 yards out, which flies into the stands</p>

<p>48 min: Saka dives in for a shot, off another clever Aubameyang run and cross. It's deflected behind for a corner. Willian delivers, but West Ham get it clear, and Leno comes all the way to the halfway line to get Arsenal back on the attack</p>

<p>Arsenal get us going for the second half. No subs yet</p>

<p>All even at half time then, and on the balance of the stats, it's a pretty fair scoreline. Not many chances either way, but when they've come, the strikers have been on hand to finish. David Moyes will likely be very happy with a draw. The team talk for Arteta changed right on the stroke of half time.</p>

<p>45 min: How about this then?!</p>

<p>West Ham have looked the most threatening on the counter attack, and that's exactly where they've capitalised. Fredericks comes down the right, puts a low cross in, and Antonio is there for a poacher's finish, beating Holding to the ball. </p>

<p>Game on!</p>

<p>40 min: Aubameyang and Ceballos link up, and the ball comes over the top for Saka. Now it's Kolasinac who charges into the box as waves of red shirts come forward. Cresswell finally gets the ball away, and after it's all said and done, Fredericks gets called up for a late challenge on Saka.</p>

<p>38 min: A period of sustained possession for Arsenal, and West Ham haven't really threatened since the goal went in. Will David Moyes have anything different planned for the second half?</p>

<p>33 min: Couple of set plays come to nothing for West Ham, and Lacazette uses his head again at the other end to clear. VAR were looking at a handball against Holding in the box, but have decided to not give anything.</p>

<p>30 min: Youngster Saka gets the ball and moves into the box. He has a bit of space so tries a shot, but it's just over the bar</p>

<p>West Ham had the best of the first 25 minutes, but all it took was a bit of quality from Arsenal's captain, and the Gunners are ahead. All to do for West Ham now</p>

<p>26 min: Hold on... VAR... it's given!</p>

<p>It's the first time we've heard his name, and Aubameyang is played in behind, who puts in a beautiful floating cross for Lacazette to simply head home for the lead. Auba looked offside, but he was just being played on by a trailing leg.</p>

<p>24 min: Lacazette holds off Ogbonna using good strength, and the referee gives a free kick to the Arsenal man. Both of them see the funny side, just as it looked like they were about to square up</p>

<p>21 min: Cresswell gives it away to Bellerin who's off down the right, but Rice again does well this time in defence, sliding in on the edge of the box to get the ball back</p>

<p>19 min: Nice play from Rice to come forward and find a pass. Masuaka puts a cross in, but the referee calls for a free-kick the other way. Arsenal still yet to find a real foothold.</p>

<p>16 min: Bowen does really well to try and hold the ball up, but then he goes over under very little pressure. Could he have stayed on his feet to greater effect?</p>

<p>14 min: West Ham come away with it again, and Antonio makes a run towards the box and tries to power it into the bottom corner, but Leno is equal to it.</p>

<p>13 min: West Ham content to have men sit behind the ball, happy to have Arsenal play around in front of them, and eventually the Gunners give it away and West Ham are able to press higher up the pitch. Not many chances for either side so far</p>

<p>10 min: Arsenal try and slow things down, finally getting some good possession.</p>

<p>7 min: Well not much is expected of West Ham, but they've had the best of it so far, now with a free kick in a decent area. It's tapped to Rice, who powers it towards goal, but it's deflected wide for a corner. </p>

<p>By the way, Tierney was injured in the warm-up, so Sead Kolasinac took his place in the starting lineup. Bit of a worry for Arteta there</p>

<p>5 min: It's an outswinger, and Rice gets his head to it first, it comes down to Ogbonna, but he can't direct his own header into the back of the net, as Leno falls on the ball.</p>

<p>3 min: Xhaka gives the ball away, and Bowen manages to get a cross in, but it's headed clear. Bit of a let off for the Gunners. </p>

<p>2 min: Lacazette and Willian link up in the box, but neither of them can find room to get a shot away. </p>

<p>1 min: Arsenal trying to put some quick passes together from the off. Bit of aggression from West Ham, and they've given away a free kick in the early goings.</p>

<p>After kneeling down to support the fight against racial inequality, West Ham get us underway</p>

<p>Not a good day to be a goalkeeper.</p>

<p>Everton 5-2 West Brom</p>

<p>Leeds 4-3 Fulham</p>

<p>Man United 1-3 Crystal Palace</p>

<p>How many more will we see at the Emirates tonight?</p>

<p>The players are heading back inside for their final preparations, and then we'll be ready to go.</p>

<p>Can West Ham show any improvement, and will Arsenal continue to push on after a couple of trophy wins?</p>

<p>Not the best start for Manchester United, who just lost their opening game of the season 3-1 at home to Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>David Moyes isn't the only manager with a headache</p>

<p>Martinez found himself Arsenal's hero at the end of last season, and he's now secured a move to Aston Villa, as well as an international call up.</p>

<p>Arsenal appear to be on the up. They've brought in some new signings and their all-important captain Aubameyang has signed a new deal. A good win today could see them back to the top of the table. </p>

<p>Meanwhile West Ham are struggling. They had a tough loss to Newcastle last week, then captain Mark Noble hit out at the board amid fan protests. Now they've got to play Arsenal, Manchester City, Leicester, Tottenham, and Liverpool over their next six league games. </p>

<p>Starting XI: Fabianski, Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Masuaku, Rice, Soucek, Fornals, Bowen, Antonio</p>

<p>Subs: Randolph, Balbuena, Johnson, Yarmolenko, Anderson, Lanzini, Haller</p>

<p>Toe injury for Mark Noble...</p>

<p>Starting XI: Leno, Bellerin, Gabriel, Holding, Tierney, Xhaka, Ceballos, Saka, Willian, Aubameyang, Lacazette</p>

<p>Subs: Macey, David Luiz, Kolasinac, Maitland-Niles, Elneny, Pepe, Nkeitah</p>

<p>Two changes from last weekend, Saka and Ceballos are in for Maitland-Niles and Elneny</p>
