<p>Happy together: Matt Dillon hit the red carpet with his partner of five years, Italian actress Roberta Mastromichele, for his upcoming film, The Great Fellove</p>

<p>Matt, 56, looked dapper in a navy suit and matching T-shirt that he teamed with patent black brogues and classic shades to shield his eyes from the Mediterranean sun.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Roberta, 46, displayed her slender pins in a muted pink dress with ruffled detailing. </p>

<p>She opted for a black bomber jacket and black mules adorned with silver studs. </p>

<p>The actress enhanced her bronzed complexion with subtle makeup and styled her ombré tresses in chic loose waves.   </p>

<p>In love: The thespian couple, 56 and 44, proved that romance is still in the air as they held hands and attended the 68th San Sebastian International Film Festival in Spain on Tuesday</p>

<p>Suited and booted: Matt looked dapper in a navy suit and matching v-neck t-shirt which he paired with black brogues</p>

<p>Staying protected: He sported a rugged long stubble and wore classic black shades to shield his eyes from the Mediterranean sun</p>

<p>Matt has followed in the footsteps of Clint Eastwood and Marlon Brando by transitioning from acting into directing, as displayed in his new film, The Great Fellove. </p>

<p>The new documentary film follows the story of Cuban scat musician, Francisco Fellove, and is Matt's second feature as a director following his debut 17 years ago with the film, City Of Ghosts.</p>

<p>A big fan of Francisco's music, Matt and his pal Joey Altruda jetted off to Mexico City in the late '90s to meet the singer and document the recording of his final album, 'Fellove &amp; Joey'. </p>

<p>The musician passed away in 2013, so Matt decided to use his catalogue of his old recordings to flesh out a documentary about him and unpack his influence on the Cuban and Mexican music scene.   </p>

<p>Pretty in pink: Roberta displayed her slender pins in a muted pink dress with ruffled detailing and black mules adorned with silver studs</p>

<p>Finishing touches: The actress enhanced her bronzed complexion with a subtle makeup look and styled her ombré tresses in a chic loose wave</p>

<p>He revealed to Deadline what it was like working with Francisco: 'He was an amazing guy, I loved his music. Back in 1999 [when they went to make the record] he didn’t know who I was, he thought I was a cable wrangler.  </p>

<p>'I love Cuban music and I was interested in the story of it, the migration of Cubans who left for Mexico [as Fellove did], it was a very interesting time and place. </p>

<p>'But Fellove was the story, his was the most poignant story for me. He’s an everyman. His success was marginal, only in performance does he live up to ‘the great’, he was a humble guy who came from poor roots. He was a real artist.'</p>
