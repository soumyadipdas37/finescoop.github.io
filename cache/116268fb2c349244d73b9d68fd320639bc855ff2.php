<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has captured the explosive final moments of a star as it goes supernova in a galaxy 70 million light years from the Earth.</p>

<p>Astronomers from Johns Hopkins University used images from the space telescope to track the fading light of the supernova to the spiral galaxy NGC 2525.   </p>

<p>The supernova, formally known as SN2018gv, was first spotted in mid-January 2018 in the constellation of Puppis in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<p>The team created a time-lapse video using images of the supernova taken between February 2018 and February 2019 and show it gradually fading to obscurity.</p>

<p>At its peak the explosion would have been up to five billion times brighter than the Sun, eclipsing all other stars and galaxies around it. </p>

<p>This is the captivating galaxy NGC 2525. Located nearly 70 million light-years from Earth. Hubble has captured a series of images of NGC2525 as part of one of its major investigations measuring the expansion rate of the universe. The supernova can be seen on the left</p>

<p>The supernova, within galaxy NGC 2525, appeared like a very bright star located on the outer edge of one of its spiral arms when it was first observed. </p>

<p>Astronomers working on a project to measure the expansion rate of the universe first pointed Hubble towards the supernova in February 2018.</p>

<p>Supernovae like this one can be used as cosmic tape measures, allowing astronomers to calculate the distance to their galaxies.  </p>

<p>Nobel Laureate Adam Riess from John Hopkins University used this supernova as a 'candle' to mark a point in space as part of the measurement of the expansion rate.</p>

<p>'No Earthly fireworks display can compete with this supernova, captured in its fading glory by the Hubble Space Telescope,' Riess said.</p>

<p>Supernovae are powerful explosions which mark the end of a star's life and this explosion is what is known as a Type 1a supernova.</p>

<p>This type of cosmic firework display originates from a white dwarf star that is in a close binary system accreting material from its companion star. </p>

<p>If the white dwarf reaches a critical mass  - 1.44 times the mass of our Sun - then its core becomes hot enough to ignite carbon fusion.</p>

<p>This triggers a runaway process that fuses large amounts of oxygen and carbon together in a matter of seconds and the energy released 'tears the star apart'.</p>

<p>Pictured here is the region surrounding NGC 2525. Located nearly 70 million light-years from Earth, this galaxy is part of the constellation of Puppis in the southern hemisphere</p>

<p>On the left of this image a brilliant supernova is clearly visible in the image. The supernova is formally known as SN2018gv and was first spotted in mid-January 2018</p>

<p>Matter is ejected from the star in a violent explosion - reaching speeds of up to 6 per cent of the speed of light and emitting huge amounts of radiation.  </p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae consistently reach a peak brightness of 5 billion times brighter than our Sun before fading over time.</p>

<p>Supernova come in different types, from the explosion of a supergiant star to a star found in a binary system.</p>

<p>Type 1a supernovae involve a white dwarf in a close binary pairing with another star.</p>

<p>This type of cosmic firework display kick stars as the white dwarf accretes material from its companion star. </p>

<p>If the white dwarf reaches a critical mass  - 1.44 times the mass of our Sun - then its core becomes hot enough to ignite carbon fusion.</p>

<p>This triggers a runaway thermonuclear process that fuses large amounts of oxygen and carbon together in a matter of seconds.</p>

<p>The energy released tears the star apart in a violent explosion.</p>

<p>Matter is ejected at speeds up to 6 per cent of the speed of light.</p>

<p>This matter also emits huge amounts of radiation.</p>

<p>Type Ia supernovae consistently reach a peak brightness of 5 billion times brighter than our Sun.</p>

<p>Then they begin to fade over time into relative obscurity. </p>

<p>Because supernovae of this type produce this fixed brightness, they are useful tools for astronomers, known as 'standard candles', which act as cosmic tape measures. </p>

<p>Knowing the actual brightness of the supernova and observing its apparent brightness in the sky, astronomers can calculate the distance to these grand spectacles and therefore their galaxies. </p>

<p>Riess and his team combined the distance measurements from the supernovae with distances calculated using variable stars known as Cepheid variables. </p>

<p>Cepheid variables pulsate in size, causing periodic changes in brightness. </p>

<p>As this period is directly related to the star's brightness, astronomers can calculate the distance to them.</p>

<p>The team are interested in accurately measuring the distance to these galaxies since it helps them better constrain the expansion rate of the universe.</p>

<p>This expansion rate is also known as the Hubble constant. </p>

<p>This value accounts for how fast the universe is expanding depending on its distance from us, with more distant galaxies moving faster away from us. </p>

<p>Since it launched, NASA/ESA's Hubble Space Telescope has helped dramatically improve the precision of the Hubble constant. </p>

<p>Results from the same observing program led by Riess have now reduced the uncertainty of their measurement to an unprecedented 1.9 per cent. </p>

<p>Further measurements of the galaxy the supernova was found in will contribute to their goal of reducing the uncertainty down to 1 per cent.</p>

<p>Achieving this goal will allow them to pinpoint how fast the universe is expanding. </p>

<p>A more accurate Hubble constant may uncover clues about the invisible dark matter and mysterious dark energy that make up the majority of our universe.   </p>

<p>The Hubble telescope was launched on April 24, 1990, via the space shuttle Discovery from Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.</p>

<p>It is named after famed astronomer Edwin Hubble who was born in Missouri in 1889.</p>

<p>He is arguably most famous for discovering that the universe is expanding and the rate at which is does so - now coined the Hubble constant. </p>

<p>The Hubble telescope is named after famed astronomer Edwin Hubble who was born in Missouri in 1889 (pictured)</p>

<p>Hubble has made more than 1.3 million observations since its mission began in 1990 and helped publish more than 15,000 scientific papers.</p>

<p>It orbits Earth at a speed of about 17,000mph (27,300kph) in low Earth orbit at about 340 miles in altitude.</p>

<p>Hubble has the pointing accuracy of .007 arc seconds, which is like being able to shine a laser beam focused on Franklin D. Roosevelt's head on a dime roughly 200 miles (320km) away.</p>

<p>The Hubble telescope is named after Edwin Hubble who was responsible for coming up with the Hubble constant and is one of the greatest astronomers of all-time</p>

<p>Hubble's primary mirror is 2.4 meters (7 feet, 10.5 inches) across and in total is 13.3 meters (43.5 feet) long - the length of a large school bus.</p>

<p>Hubble's launch and deployment in April 1990 marked the most significant advance in astronomy since Galileo's telescope. </p>

<p>Thanks to five servicing missions and more than 25 years of operation, our view of the universe and our place within it has never been the same. </p>
