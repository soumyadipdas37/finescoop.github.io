<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Melbourne autistic teen William Wall has been found dead, 22 hours after he went missing in Melbourne's outskirts.</p>

<p>The 14-year-old went missing after he went for his daily jog along the Yarra Ranges' Warburton Trail at 6.45am on Tuesday, promising his family he would be back in 15 minutes. </p>

<p>He never returned to his home in Launching Place. </p>

<p>Victoria Police confirmed his body had been found in Yarra Junction during the second day of the search on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>His death is not being treated as suspicious and police will prepare a report for the Coroner.</p>

<p>Earlier on Wednesday, locals fumed after being advised to keep an eye out for William, but not to breach Victoria's COVID-19 restrictions by limiting outdoor time to two hours.</p>

<p>'In line with coronavirus restrictions, at this stage we do not require any assistance from the public,' a post on the Eyewatch Yarra Ranges Police Facebook read on Tuesday night. </p>

<p>'We want to say a big thank you however, for the all the offers we have received.' </p>

<p>More to come.  </p>

<p>William Wall (Pictured), 14, was found dead at Yarra Junction, Melbourne on Wednesday after going missing on his daily jog on Tuesday</p>
