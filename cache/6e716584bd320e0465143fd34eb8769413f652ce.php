<p>Glittering: Cate's outfit was embellished with silver and gold beads, and she complemented her ensemble by wearing an array of gold bracelets</p>

<p>Cate's outing comes after she revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'. </p>

<p>Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor. </p>

<p>'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.' </p>

<p>Cate is heading the jury at Venice during an historic year, when the number of women directors competing for the top prize has quadrupled to eight.</p>

<p>'I think a good performance is a good performance no matter the sexual orientation of who is making them,' she added of her thoughts on the matter.</p>

<p>'The hardest thing as a jury member is to sit in judgement of other people's work. That's the hardest thing not the (gender) demarcation.' </p>

<p>The Venice Film Festival is one of the world's oldest award ceremonies and is listed as one of the 'Big Five' events. It starts on 2 September and ends on the 12 September.</p>

<p>According to Variety, when the Film Festival unveiled its official selection in late July, the 'unprecedented inclusion of eight female-directed titles within the 18-film roster was heralded as welcome progress for an event that has come under fire in recent years for scarce representation of female filmmakers.'</p>

<p>Cate was chosen to head the jury back in January, making her the third woman in four years to hold the role.</p>
