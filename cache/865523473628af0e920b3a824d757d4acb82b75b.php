<p>Big project in The Boot: Lorraine Bracco is trying to live the dream in Sicily, Italy on a budget</p>

<p>Italian dream: The Sopranos star is renovating a 200-year-old home that she purchased for only one Euro as part of the new HGTV show My Big Italian Adventure</p>

<p>A smash hit series: The versatile actress is probably best known for her role opposite James Gandolfini in The Sopranos; seen in 1999</p>

<p>The home is a 1,075-square-foot property that needs plenty of TLC - there is no electricity, running water, kitchen or bathrooms. And the floors and roof also need to be replaced as they have rotted.</p>

<p>It is located on top of a hill in the small town of Sambuca di Sicilia in southern Italy.</p>

<p>She has three years to complete the home, which is part of the deal, but that is no problem for the star. </p>

<p>When she arrives at the villa, it shows signs of longtime neglect. It is her job to figure out how to get the place in working order.</p>

<p>The set-up: For the past several years, cities in southern Italy have been selling off abandoned, dilapidated homes for just over a dollar it tries to re-populate the small towns that residents have abandoned for bigger paychecks in large cities</p>

<p>So much to do: And the floors and roof also need to be replaced as they have rotted</p>

<p>She needs help: But Bracco does not have to do it all herself - she has the help of an architect, contractor and construction crews from the area</p>

<p>'I believe life is an adventure,' said Bracco.</p>

<p>'When I saw the article that you could buy a house in Sambuca for one euro, I jumped on it. So, I came on the plane. I bought the house.'</p>

<p>'This is a huge undertaking,' said Bracco. 'I'm not a contractor. I'm not a decorator. I'm an actress. I've never done this before. I have no idea what I'm really getting into! It's a lot of work, but everything is possible. I believe that. And for one euro, we'll see!'</p>
