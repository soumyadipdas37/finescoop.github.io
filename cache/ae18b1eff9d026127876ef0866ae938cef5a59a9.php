<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jack Grealish has been handed his first England call-up as the FA confirmed Marcus Rashford and Harry Winks have withdrawn from the squad to face Iceland and Denmark.</p>

<p>Grealish was a surprise omission from the original squad following his brilliant form for Aston Villa last season.</p>

<p>But Rashford's withdrawal has opened the door to the Villa skipper to meet up with the senior set-up for the first time.</p>

<p>Aston Villa captain Jack Grealish has been called up to the England squad for the first time</p>

<p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has withdrawn from Gareth Southgate's side</p>

<p>Grealish was initially left out of the Three Lions squad with Southgate favouring in-form Manchester United forward Mason Greenwood.</p>

<p>'With Jack, the simple answer is Mason Greenwood,' the England boss said last week.</p>

<p>'He's competing in my view against Greenwood, Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Raheem Sterling. </p>

<p>The FA confirmed Tottenham midfielder Harry Winks has also pulled out of Three Lions side</p>

<p>'I know Villa have played him as an eight but I don't see him in that role for us.</p>

<p>'He could play as a 10 but we haven't played with a 10. Also some of those other players I've talked about would be very good 10s as well. He's a talent, there's no doubt about that. </p>

<p>'But I think Mason Greenwood's performances, his goalscoring ability and maturity was impossible to leave out.'</p>

<p>Southgate is preparing England for UEFA Nations League clashes against Iceland and Denmark</p>

<p>Rashford was expected to pull out with an ankle injury, a problem he has been carrying since the end of last season.</p>

<p>Tottenham midfielder Winks was forced to pull out of the squad on Monday. The FA have not confirmed the reason why.</p>

<p>The withdrawals have arrived amid a worrying Covid-19 outbreak within the Premier League since the end of last season.</p>

<p>Sportsmail knows of at least four players who have tested positive recently - developments the FA have been fully aware.</p>

<p>Manager Gareth Southgate was fearing the worst but two drop-outs was the best scenario he could have hoped for given the rise in cases among top-flight footballers.</p>
