<p>Havertz's dream of playing under Zinedine Zidane was dashed due to the coronavirus crisis</p>

<p>The Spanish publication report that Havertz was desperate for the big-money transfer to LaLiga and has settled on joining Chelsea after his first-choice outfit were unable to gather together enough funds. </p>

<p>Havertz also reportedly snubbed interest from recently-crowned Champions League winners Bayern Munich, with his sights having been firmly set on working under Zinedine Zidane.</p>
