<p>Former Manchester United defender Rafael has moved from Lyon to Istanbul Basaksehir</p>

<p>The Brazilian defender was unveiled in a bizarre Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themed video</p>

<p>The video posted on Twitter sees Rafael putting on the club's shirt to the theme music of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. </p>

<p>Rafael gets into the spirit of the club's unique idea, putting on an orange Ninja Turtles style mask and walking onto the club's pitch.</p>

<p>The popular children's television show saw four superhero turtles trained by their rat sensei, battling criminals in New York City.</p>

<p>One of the four turtles is called Raphael which is where the club have produced the link between their new signing and the show.</p>

<p>Transfer announcements have changed over the years from just the normal press conferences with the player doing a few keep-ups on the pitch.</p>

<p>Now many clubs get involved with seeing who can produce the funniest, most memorable transfer unveilings.</p>

<p>Rafael's announcement is one of the more bizarre ones of the summer so far to date.</p>

<p>Despite 12 months remaining on his contract Lyon, the club waived their right to a transfer fee to allow Rafael to move to the Turkish Super Lig.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old's game time has reduced in the past two seasons, only making 13 appearances in the last Ligue 1 season.</p>

<p>Rafael asked to leave Lyon on a free with a year left on his contract to get more game time</p>

<p>In a statement the Istanbul club said Rafael has signed a two-year deal with the option to stay for another season. The defender will wear the No. 4 jersey, Basaksehir added.</p>

<p>Before his move Lyon, the Brazilian played with his brother Fabio at Manchester United under Sir Alex Ferguson, David Moyes and Louis Van Gaal.</p>

<p>During his seven seasons at the Red Devils, he won a FIFA Club World Cup, three Premier League titles, three English Super Cup trophies and two English League Cups.</p>
