<p>Nigella Lawson, 60, from London, divided opinion today by re-sharing her famous spaghetti with Marmite recipe on Twitter</p>

<p>Posting the recipe online, she penned: 'So many of you know and love this already, and the rest of you are probably horrified by it: #RecipeOfTheDay is Spaghetti with Marmite. (Australians may obviously use vegemite.)'</p>

<p>She added: 'And Italians, don’t shout at me: this comes via the great Anna del Conte!' </p>

<p>Nigella created the recipe with the help of Italian-born food writer, 95, from Milan, whose memoirs 'Risotto with Nettles' also included the dish. </p>

<p>It is inspired by a traditional day-after-the-roast pasta dish in which spaghetti is tossed in meat stock.  </p>
