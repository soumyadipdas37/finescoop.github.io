<p>But the I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! live final date has been moved to avoid a clash with Strictly Come Dancing, it was reported on Sunday. </p>

<p>ITV are said to be taking the steps to ensure the upcoming 20th season of the long-running show is a success and to avoid a ratings war. </p>

<p>Ratings war? The I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! live final date has been moved to avoid a clash with Strictly Come Dancing, it has been reported </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'The autumn TV schedule is packed with content as people spend cold evenings on the sofa in front of the box.</p>

<p>'So I'm A Celeb bosses have pushed for the final to be on a Friday night for the first time so they don't have to share audiences with Strictly and can dominate the viewers. </p>

<p>'ITV has ploughed close to £1million into the series and want to make it a success. So they aren't taking any chances.' </p>

<p>TV gold: The new season of Strictly is due to kick off on BBC One in October while the upcoming series of I'm A Celeb is due to begin airing on ITV1 around the same time</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted ITV for comment. </p>

<p>This year the first ever UK-based series will be filmed at the 200-year-old Gwrych Castle in Abergele, North Wales instead of in Australia. </p>

<p>The new season of Strictly is due to kick off on BBC One in October while the upcoming series of I'm A Celeb is due to begin airing on ITV1 around the same time.</p>

<p>The hit ITV series is continuing work getting the Welsh location ready for a handful of brave celebrities who will be forced to endure freezing 8°C cold temperatures and no protection from the elements. </p>

<p>Exciting! This year the first ever UK-based series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! will be filmed at the 200-year-old Gwrych Castle in Abergele, North Wales instead of in Australia</p>

<p>It won't be an easy three weeks for the celebrities taking part as they forced to sleep in gruelling November temperatures in the roofless castle - throwing the famous shower scenes in question - and there could also be the setting for some paranormal activity, as the castle has earned a reputation for being haunted. </p>

<p>As ever hosts Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly, who revealed they are being tested for Covid-19 every four days in order to host the show, will present the new series with celebrities completing an array of challenges to win food and drink for the camp, with one eventually being crowned King or Queen of the Castle. </p>

<p>Gwrych Castle is nestled in a tree lined hillside overlooking the Irish Sea, and is spread across 250 acres of gardens and grounds, with an array of picturesque turrets, alcoves and grounds. </p>

<p>Already rumours are rife about who could be taking part this year, with stars including Vernon Kay, AJ Pritchard, Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn and Tamzin Outhwaite all reported to be in talks with show bosses.  </p>

<p>Despite all the changes, it has been suggested that relocating to Wales could save ITV a considerable amount of money, which could then be used to get bigger-name stars.</p>

<p>Although the broadcaster will still have to convince them that spending three weeks in the cold countryside is as doable as three weeks in Australia. </p>

<p>Reports: It comes as rumours swirl that Selling Sunset's Christine Quinn (left) and presenter Vernon Kay (right) could be set to enter the cast this autumn </p>
