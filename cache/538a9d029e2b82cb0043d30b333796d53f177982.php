<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Packed To The Rafters star Hugh Sheridan has revealed he has now tested negative for COVID-19, after initially returning a positive test for the virus last week. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old actor, who recently returned from Los Angeles to Australia,  explained that doctors told him on Thursday night his result was actually a 'false positive'.</p>

<p>The star described the whole ordeal as a 'rollercoaster of emotions' and incredibly confusing.   </p>

<p>'I've been on the phone all night!' On Thursday, Hugh Sheridan shared an update on his positive COVID-19 results after dealing with a 'whirlwind of emotions' </p>

<p>'My latest test shows a NEGATIVE result for Covid,' Hugh wrote on his Instagram account on Thursday night.</p>

<p>'I've been on the phone all night with the RPA Virtual hospital, it looks very much like it was a false positive on the 28th of August, which makes a lot of sense.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'The process has been a rollercoaster and it's caused whirlwind of emotions.'</p>

<p>'It’s late now so I won’t know the next steps till the morning, but I wanted to share with you as so many people have shown SO MUCH kindness.'</p>

<p>Hugh went on to thank his followers for showing so much concern. </p>

<p>'My latest test shows a NEGATIVE result for Covid,' the 35-year-old wrote on his Instagram account on Thursday night, just hours after the star told fans he had previously tested positive </p>

<p>Earlier in the day, the actor revealed he had tested positive and that he'd somehow caught the deadly virus in transit from Los Angeles to Australia, last month.</p>

<p>'I've been quiet for the last few days because I've been feeling all the varied emotions about my positive Covid test. I haven't felt like talking to anyone much yet,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Hugh had jetted into Australia from Los Angeles in mid-August, and at the time was forced to undergo a mandatory 14-day stint at a quarantine hotel. </p>

<p>'I had a negative result when I arrived [in Australia]. I now know all my friends including [those] who took me to LAX airport are all negative so it's been confusing for me. It's scary, frustrating and lonely,' he said.  </p>

<p>'I got it in a very short space of time': In a lengthy Instagram post, Hugh thought he'd somehow caught the deadly virus in transit from Los Angeles to Australia last month</p>

<p>The House Husbands star confirmed he was not experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19. </p>

<p>'I am SO LUCKY &amp; I keep reminding myself to count each blessing 1 by 1. To everyone: this virus is seriously clever. Knowing now that no one I saw back home overseas has it means I got it in a very short space of time (in transit or a surface) while I had minimal human contact,' he wrote.  </p>

<p>At the time he admitted his mental health had suffered as a result of the diagnosis. </p>

<p>'I wanted to be honest with you because we all have good days and not so good days': Hugh admitted his mental health had suffered as a result of the diagnosis</p>

<p>'Why oh why did I not come with a friend?' Hugh uploaded this post last month as he began his 14-day stint of quarantine hotel, after arriving in Australia from Los Angeles </p>

<p>'I wanted to be honest with you because we all have good days and not so good days and without days like my last few the good ones wouldn't feel as good!' he explained. </p>

<p>'To everyone that received a positive Covid test, I now know how that feels, I wish we could all be together so we could offer each other a shoulder or even better a HUG!'</p>

<p>Hugh concluded by saying that he would be taking time out from social media and focusing on editing his new script.  </p>

<p>'If I'm not on social media as much it's not necessarily because I'm down, it's because it can make me feel a little worse for the moment,' he confessed. </p>

<p>'This too shall pass. I AM OK! #somuchlove.'</p>

<p>Hugh's celebrity friends rushed to share messages of support.  </p>

<p>Supportive: Rebecca Gibney (right), who recently reprised the role of Hugh's on-screen mother in the Back to the Rafters reboot, commented: 'Here for you always, sweetheart'</p>
