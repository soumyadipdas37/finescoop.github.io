<p>The New South Wales premier said the state government will offer to pay for Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks to make sure they go ahead</p>

<p>The City of Sydney council, the event's organiser, has indicated it is concerned about hosting an event that would draw large crowds to the CBD amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>State authorities reportedly accept that the fireworks display is likely to be scaled down.</p>

<p>NSW Tourism Minister Stuart Ayres is due to meet with Lord Mayor Clover Moore on Thursday to discuss the state government's proposal.</p>

<p>Treasurer Dominic Perrottet told the newspaper that the fireworks would send a strong signal that NSW was open for business.</p>

<p>'It's time for Sydney to rise and shine after a very dark year. The traditional fireworks display not only brings joy to so many people, but done well and safely, we will show the world COVID-19 can't extinguish our spirit and optimism.' </p>

<p>Ms Moore has repeatedly told state government officials it's too high a risk to put an event on like previous years.</p>

<p>She suggested the city would still be able to accommodate some revellers, but not to the same degree.</p>

<p>'We hope that we have outdoor dining and even indoor dining, slightly more liberal than what we have now, by New Year's Eve,' the Lord Mayor said last week. </p>

<p>The event typically attracts more than one million people into the city to watch the display.</p>

<p>The Lord Mayor is particularly concerned about the logistics of managing massive crowds on the city's public transport during a pandemic.</p>

<p>She said the city could not handle another lockdown.</p>
