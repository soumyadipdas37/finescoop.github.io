<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It may not be among the most prominent of our tertiary institutions but Australian Catholic University has come out top in a new survey measuring how readily graduates find jobs.</p>

<p>The 2020 Graduate Outcomes Survey assessed students who finished their studies in 2017 from 79 different institutions, the highest participation ever.</p>

<p>It measured not only which institutions did best, but which degrees.</p>

<p>A survey has revealed the universities with the highest employment rates after graduation across the country (stock)</p>

<p>The Australian Catholic University (Strathfield, NSW, campus pictured) has the best employment rate for undergraduates three years after they finish university with 95.5 per cent of students now in jobs</p>

<p>'Three years after graduation there has been substantial improvement in full-time employment rates across universities so that all universities have full-time employment rates for undergraduates above 81 per cent,' the study said.</p>

<p>Twelve of the universities full-time employment rates increased by 20 per cent over the three-year period. </p>

<p>The courses with the highest employment rates mid-term are:</p>

<p>The courses with the lowest employment rates short-term are: </p>

<p>The Australian Catholic University (ACU) has the best employment rate for undergraduates three years after they finish university with 95.5 per cent of students now in full-time jobs.</p>

<p>Next came Australian National University and the nearby University of Canberra.</p>

<p>As well as graduates ,ACU also took out the top spot for those who completed their postgraduate studies in 2017.</p>

<p>On the postgraduate score, ACU was top, followed by Federation University Australia and The University of Notre Dame Australia.</p>

<p>In terms of fields of study, medicine graduates performed best, with 97.3 of those with a medical degree being employed three years after completing their course. </p>

<p>Engineering fared almost as well at 96.3 per cent, while mathematics was the third best degree in terms of medium-term employability.</p>

<p>But it was not all good news for STEM graduates, with short-term employability - classed as those in work a year after graduation - being lowest for biology, science technology and general science and mathematics. </p>

<p>The survey found average pay for graduates had risen only marginally when accounting for inflation, from $67,000 in 2016 to $75,000 in 2020. </p>

<p>ACU was followed by the Australian National University (pictured) and the University of Canberra</p>
