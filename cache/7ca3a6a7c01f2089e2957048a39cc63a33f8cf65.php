<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Photos have emerged of dozens of students at a Florida high school crowding to get on buses following the first day of in person classes.</p>

<p>The images were taken of students at Bartow High School in Polk County, just outside Tampa, last week. </p>

<p>Ashlee Caraway, a former student whose younger sister still attends the school, posted the photos on Facebook with the caption: '#covid19.' </p>

<p>They show dozens of students crowding together outside the school as they waited to board buses at the end of the day. </p>

<p>Some students can be seen wearing masks in the photos. </p>

<p>The images were taken of students at Bartow High School in Polk County, just outside Tampa, last week</p>

<p>The photos, which appear to be screenshots from a Snapchat video, have the caption 'whole lotta social distancing' and 'social distancing to the MAX' written across them. </p>

<p>In an interview with the Daily Beast, Caraway said the lack of social distancing enforcement shown in the photos was 'messed up'. </p>

<p>'I want people to see how messed up it is,' Caraway said of her decision to share the photos on social media. </p>

<p>'If the health department went in there they would be shut down.' </p>

<p>No students at Bartow High have tested positive for COVID-19 in the week since classes began but a student at the Sumerlin Academy was confirmed to have the virus on the second day of in person classes. </p>

<p>Sumerlin is a public military school that shares a campus with Bartow. The military school's students sometimes attend classes at Bartow facilities. </p>

<p>Caraway said her younger sister had decided to stay home for the rest of the week after learning the Sumerlin student had tested positive. </p>

<p>'She decided to stay home and let the week ride out,' Caraway said.</p>

<p>Bartow High is one of the 150 schools that falls under the Polk County school district. </p>

<p>A spokesman for the district said they were aware of the social distancing issues apparent in the photos and had been working to address them. </p>

<p>'Staff… assessed conditions after the first two days of school,' the spokesman said. </p>

<p>'On Wednesday afternoon, the school started releasing students by bus number to further spread them out and help cut down on crowding. </p>

<p>'School staff are present during dismissal and are reminding students not to bunch together.'</p>

<p>He said the school was taking the temperatures of 20 percent of the student population, which is required by the district. </p>

<p>Polk County currently accounts for just over 17,000 of Florida's 630,000 cases. More than 2,400 of the county's cases are between the ages of 15 and 24. </p>
