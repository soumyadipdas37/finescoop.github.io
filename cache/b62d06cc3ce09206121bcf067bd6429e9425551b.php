<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leicester City target Wesley Fofana has turned down the offer of a new contract from St Etienne as he pushes for a move to England.</p>

<p>Leicester have bid around £22m for the 19-year-old centre-back who is the number one target for their defence. </p>

<p>Fofana has urged his club to accept Leicester's offer and said: 'I'd be crazy to say no to Leicester. </p>

<p>Defender Wesley Fofana has urged St Etienne to allow him to join Leicester City this summer</p>

<p>'I am aware of taking a risk by leaving early abroad, but I'm determined and mentally ready. </p>

<p>'By putting in that sum Leicester are proving they really want me.'</p>

<p>Leicester have watched Fofana for some time. </p>

<p>The 19-year-old centre back is keen to make the move from France to the Premier League </p>

<p>Though still raw, he is regarded as one of the best defensive prospects in Europe and has interest from AC Milan, Red Bull Leipzig and West Ham among others. </p>

<p>Leicester hope Fofana's comments can help conclude a deal and want to add another winger before the window closes.  </p>
