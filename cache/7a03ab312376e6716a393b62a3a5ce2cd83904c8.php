<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 'manipulative and abusive' boyfriend who stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death with a kitchen knife after she ended their relationship has been jailed for life.   </p>

<p>Paul Crowther, 36, from Batley, West Yorkshire, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of 'talented' university student Bethany Fields, 21, after he was diagnosed with schizophrenia following her death last September.</p>

<p>Crowther claimed he was told to kill Miss Fields by voices in his head called Chucky and Osiris.</p>

<p>And when he was arrested he was heard saying: 'I did what you f****** said, I did what you asked, now f*** off.'  </p>

<p>Judge Tom Bayliss QC said he accepted that Crowther's decision to kill Miss Fields was driven by his condition, but he rejected the suggestion that he was in a 'state of altered awareness' at the time, describing his actions as 'entirely logical and rational'.</p>

<p>He described Crowther as a 'very dangerous man indeed' as he ordered him to be detained in hospital as part of his minimum sentence of 12 years.</p>

<p>He told Leeds Crown Court that Miss Fields described her ex-boyfriend as 'manipulative, abusive and controlling'.</p>

<p>Miss Fields, a geography student, warned police before her death that Crowther had 'an obsession with killing someone and what it would feel like'.</p>

<p>She said: 'I genuinely don't know what to do. I am scared and frightened of what he will do and it's made me fearful for others.</p>

<p>'All I want is for him to leave me alone.' </p>

<p>Jude Bayliss added: 'She told police that the abuse, which was initially low key, began to intensify.'</p>

<p>The court heard that Crowther had suffered from mental health issues for a number of years and had been detained in hospital several times after threatening suicide, having thoughts about killing others and hearing voices.</p>

<p>Judge Bayliss said: 'Bethany Fields did what she could to help him with his mental health issues but it all became too much for her to cope with and she ended their relationship.'</p>

<p>The court heard that, following the split, Crowther saw the psychiatric liaison team at Dewsbury District Hospital on three occasions, where he said he wanted to attack others and kill himself, but was not detained. </p>

<p>The 'manipulative and abusive' boyfriend claimed he was told to kill Miss Fields (pictured) by voices in his head called Chucky and Osiris</p>

<p>He then sent a 'constant' barrage of abuse and threats to Miss Fields after finding she had started a new relationship. </p>

<p>The court heard that Miss Fields worked for an organisation that provided music therapy for people with disabilities and learning difficulties and was hosting an event at a pub in Huddersfield on September 12, 2019.</p>

<p>Crowther armed himself with two knives, including a six-inch kitchen knife he bought eight days earlier and made allegations about Miss Fields to police before driving to Huddersfield and attacking her.</p>

<p>The judge said the attack was captured on CCTV.</p>

<p>He said: 'It shows a targeted and sustained attack. She was stabbed multiple times and after the attack the defendant ran back to his car and drove off.'</p>

<p>Miss Fields was pronounced dead at the scene despite attempts by her friends and passers-by to save her life.</p>

<p>Crowther tried to get away from police on the motorway before leaving his car on a bridge and climbing over railings while holding a knife to his throat.</p>

<p>He was later taken to hospital and then to the police station, where he refused to answer questions during interview and claimed he had amnesia about killing Miss Fields.</p>

<p>Judge Bayliss said: 'I am quite sure that you knew perfectly well what you were doing. You may have amnesia for what you have done. But you knew what you were doing.'</p>

<p>He added: 'You are, Paul Crowther, I am sorry to say, a very dangerous man.' </p>

<p>Crowther and Ms Fields began a relationship in October 2017 and moved in together in 2018.</p>

<p>On June 15, 2019, she ended their relationship and was about to start a course in environmental studies at the University of York.</p>

<p>After learning that she had started a new relationship, Crowther went 'ape s***' and made threats about Ms Fields' new boyfriend.  </p>

<p>The court heard that Miss Fields worked for an organisation that provided music therapy for people with disabilities and learning difficulties and was hosting an event at a pub in Huddersfield on the day she was killed last year - September 12, 2019 </p>

<p>In a heart wrenching statement, Bethany's grieving mother Pauline Jones said her 'life ended' the day her daughter was killed.</p>

<p>She said: 'That horrible evening, hearing my beautiful daughter, my only child, my beloved child, had been brutally, groundlesslessly and deliberately taken by such evil.</p>

<p>'By a man who I have taken into my home, who I thought I could trust, who turned out to be a cold blooded murderer.</p>

<p>'I did not have the will or interest in life, as far as I'm concerned my life ended with that moment of violence.</p>

<p>'Bethany wasn't just my daughter, she was my best friend, my ray of sunshine.</p>

<p>Judge Bayliss told Leeds Crown Court (pictured): 'I am quite sure that you knew perfectly well what you were doing. You may have amnesia for what you have done. But you knew what you were doing'</p>

<p>'I was devoted to my daughter working hard as a single mother to secure a future for her, but it now means nothing.</p>

<p>'She was beautiful, inside and out, talented, kind, gracious, giving, loyal - and inspirational to many.</p>

<p>'A daughter every parent would be proud of.</p>

<p>'The day I had to go identify her body was the worst day of my life.</p>

<p>'My love and admiration for Bethany could fill the entire universe, my pride the same.</p>

<p>'Bethany only wanted to do good, such a love for nature and the planet and she had qualities which would have made her a wonderful mother.</p>

<p>'But through the savagery of Paul Crowther's actions, I and the world will never know how much she would have done.</p>

<p>'I feel so lost, bewildered, as to how such a lovable, passionate, gregarious young woman full of love and capacity for compassion could have her life ended from such hate.</p>

<p>'I will hold her in my heart for all of eternity. Bethany was far too good to ever be forgotten, a real earth angel.' </p>
