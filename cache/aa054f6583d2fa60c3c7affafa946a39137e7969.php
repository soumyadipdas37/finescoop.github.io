<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced this evening that Denmark is one of four countries being added to the Government's travel quarantine 'red list' this weekend.  </p>

<p>Restrictions are also being reimposed on arrivals from Iceland, Slovakia and the Caribbean island of Curacao after they all suffered an increase in coronavirus cases.</p>

<p>It means travellers returning from those destinations to England will face 14 days in quarantine when they get back. </p>

<p>The new rules will come into force at 4am on Saturday morning. </p>

<p>Mr Shapps also said that no countries are being removed from the 'red list' this week.  </p>

<p>The devolved administrations often update their own lists following the UK Government’s announcement of its weekly changes for England.</p>

<p>Transport Secretary Grant Shapps today announced Denmark, Slovakia, Iceland and Curacao are being added to the Government's travel quarantine 'red list'</p>

<p>Mr Shapps reminded travellers that they are legally required to fill out a 'Passenger Locator Form' when they return to England. </p>

<p>Announcing the changes, Mr Shapps tweeted: 'Data shows we need to remove DENMARK, SLOVAKIA, ICELAND, and CURACAO from the Travel Corridor list. </p>

<p>'If you arrive in the UK from these destinations after 4am this Saturday, you will need to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p>'We will not be adding any destinations to the Travel Corridor list this week. </p>

<p>'Remember: You MUST complete a Passenger Locator Form by law if you enter the UK. </p>

<p>'This protects public health and ensures those who need to are complying with self-isolation rules.' </p>

<p>The UK Government currently uses a threshold of 20 cases per 100,000 when it makes decisions on whether to add or remove countries from its quarantine list.  </p>

<p>Downing Street remains under intense pressure to change the UK's travel quarantine rules amid growing fears for the future of the aviation and travel industries. </p>

<p>Ministers have faced calls for months to replace the current 14 day self-isolation restrictions for people returning to the UK from high risk countries with a more nuanced system of airport testing. </p>

<p>Advocates believe testing on arrival could open the door to significantly reducing the two week quarantine period to potentially less than seven days. </p>

<p>A double testing approach would see travellers tested on arrival and then told to self-isolate for something like five days when they would then be tested for a second time. </p>

<p>Two negative tests would be enough to allow people to end their period in quarantine and return to normal life. </p>

<p>However, ministers have been reluctant to approve airport testing because of concerns that the approach could fail to identify some people who have the virus. </p>

<p>This is because of the amount of time it can take for the virus to be detectable after the moment of infection. </p>

<p>But many MPs believe the current blanket approach to travel quarantine cannot continue for much longer because of the damage it is doing to the aviation sector. </p>
