<p>Pals: While celebrity pal, Denise Van Outen, added: 'Suits you! Daddy vibes.'</p>

<p>He added on a separate snap: 'Another one (wont be the last) just because I cannot cope with this little man.... </p>

<p>'I must say, he took to uncle Mark like a duck takes to water !! Brody Allen welcome to the world little fella !! Another hammer  to join the clan !!' </p>

<p>While Michelle, who also posted a sweet video cuddling Brody, penned: 'B R O D Y A L L E N … you're so loved.' </p>

<p>In June, Michelle revealed her 'frustration' at people constantly questioning why she and husband Mark don't have children, insisting 'nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors'. </p>

<p>Welcome to the family: Mark had captioned the photo: 'The day I met Brody. New member to the clan. Gorgeous little boy. <?php echo e('@'); ?>katiefearnehoughx &amp; Tony he is beautiful !! love him already.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Lovely: Michelle captioned her sweet image with: 'B R O D Y A L L E N … you’re so loved'</p>

<p>The actress, who has been married to the TOWIE star turned TV presenter for five years, hit out at sexist double standards - admitting queries about when she is going to have a baby do 'bother' her now.</p>

<p>In an interview with the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine, she said: 'A few years ago it didn't bother me and I answered the question, but now I think, "I don't need to answer that because nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors". </p>

<p>'I remember when I finished Our Girl people were like, "Is it because you're going off to have a baby?" </p>

<p>'I know for a fact if Mark finished a job, nobody would ask him if he was going to have a baby. It's not fair. It does make me feel frustrated.' </p>

<p>Frustrating: In June, Michelle revealed her 'frustration' at people constantly questioning why she and husband Mark don't have children, insisting 'nobody knows what goes on behind closed doors'</p>

<p>Michelle previously told of her frustrations about the subject last year, telling  The Sun: 'It’s horrible. It’s like, "You’re 32. Are you not yet?" People don’t know if we’re trying. They don’t know the background of what’s happening. </p>

<p>'It’s no one else’s business. In this day and age you shouldn’t ask questions like that.'</p>

<p>Michelle added that she has learned to brush off the question and said it is 'no one else's business.' </p>

<p>Michelle and husband Mark have been together since late 2012 when they met while they were both on holiday in Dubai. </p>

<p>The former TOWIE star popped the question nine months later and the pair married in a lavish ceremony at Hengrave Hall in Suffolk in May 2015.</p>

<p>The couple previously had to conduct a long distance relationship while Michelle worked in South Africa for extended periods for BBC drama Our Girl, and Mark had filming commitments on EXTRA in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Happy couple: Michelle and husband Mark have been together since late 2012 when they met on holiday in Dubai, and have been married for five years</p>
