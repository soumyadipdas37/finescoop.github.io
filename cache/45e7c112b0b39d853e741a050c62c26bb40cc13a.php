<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Welshman is suing his former employer for racism after claiming his colleagues made repeated references to 'sheep sh***ing' and told him his native language sounded 'like someone spewing in a bucket'.</p>

<p>James Bracegirdle, 61, alleged workmates named an office mannequin used to display personal protective equipment 'baa-bera' and asked him whether he had received wellington boots for Christmas. </p>

<p>The health and safety expert believes the boots were a reference to 'sheep sh*<strong>ing', and said they implied Welshmen would put the animal's hind legs between their boots in order to have s</strong> with them. </p>

<p>The married father-of-one worked as a Network Rail HSEQ adviser at Quinn Infrastructure Services Ltd, based in London, for two years before quitting in July 2019. He is from the coastal town of Llandudno, north Wales.</p>

<p>James Bracegirdle has accused his former employer, London-based Quinn Infrastructure Services Ltd, of racism. He claims the office had a personal protective equipment mannequin that they named 'baa-bera' and said his native language 'sounded like someone spewing'</p>

<p>In a preliminary hearing held in London, Mr Bracegirdle claimed he was subjected to 'staple insults heard more on a building site than in an office environment' that became 'increasingly hostile racist banter'.</p>

<p>Phrases flung at the employee included 'Taffy bastard', 'Welsh c<strong><em>' and references to sheep sh</em></strong>ing, he claimed.</p>

<p>The abuse got worse after his sister's 'sudden death' in April 2019, he added, when he needed to spend more time speaking to relatives on the phone in Welsh. </p>

<p>'The banter was said to have intensified when he had to make telephone calls in Welsh at work to family members following his sister’s sudden death,' the judgement states.</p>

<p>'(He) says he was told that Welsh speech "sounds like you are spewing in a bucket".'</p>

<p>The health and safety expert, from Llandudno in North Wales (pictured), worked for the company for two years before quitting</p>

<p>Mr Bracegirdle told The Sun he was taking his employer to court to get 'respect for Welsh people'. </p>

<p>'We need to move on from stereotyping. Eventually it just wears you down,' he said.</p>

<p>Quinn Infrastructure Services Ltd, which provides infrastructure for the rail network, has denied all the allegations while also suggesting that Mr Bracegirdle ‘encouraged’ and joined in on the ‘banter’.</p>

<p>They told the tribunal that when his colleagues wished him happy St David’s Day, he replied by saying there was ‘not a sign of a willing sheep anywhere’. </p>

<p>Quinn Infrastructure Services Ltd claim he left after his performance at work was criticised.</p>

<p>A further hearing will be held in due course by Employment Judge Goodman who allowed Mr Bracegirdle’s claims of racial harassment to proceed.</p>
