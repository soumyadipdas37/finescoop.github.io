<p>Sheffield United defender Jack O'Connell is set to miss the rest of the season with a knee injury</p>

<p>The 26-year-old played in United's first two Premier League matches of the season</p>

<p>Speaking before the Bramall Lane encounter, Wilder said: 'It's really bad news from our point of view. Jack's possibly going to be out for the rest of the season. </p>

<p>'He needs an operation on a knee he injured last year. He's tried to come back, we've had it scanned and he was a big part of the back three who did outstandingly well last season. </p>

<p>'We've got to adjust pretty quickly but it's just more bad news for Jack really because he established himself well in the Premier League last year. </p>

<p>'He had a fabulous season and for him to be out for the rest of the season is a huge blow for him and us.'</p>

<p>Chris Wilder confirmed the devastating blow just before the Blades' match with Leeds United</p>

<p>O'Connell played 33 times in the Premier League last term as Sheffield United finished ninth</p>

<p>Chris Basham, Jack Robinson and debutant Ethan Ampadu started the Leeds match in a back three, with the latter making his first Premier League start following his loan move from Chelsea earlier this year. </p>

<p>The Blades also have Phil Jagielka , Kean Bryan and Kyron Gordon at the club as centre-half options.  </p>
