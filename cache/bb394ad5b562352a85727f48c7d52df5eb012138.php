<p>'The band couldn't come in because you couldn't fly and I'm standing there singing my song [alone],' he continued.</p>

<p>Jon also said it was 'weird' singing to no-one as he'd previously sung to half a million people in Times Square.</p>

<p>'I was reminiscing when the NFL asked us to play Times Square and we played to half a million people and now you're singing a song 20 years later alone.' </p>

<p>'That was like a weird Twilight zone,' he said.</p>

<p>Eerie: The Bon Jovi frontman said he filmed his music video for his song Do What You Can in Manhattan and the empty streets were 'surreal'</p>

<p>This comes after Jon and his 25-year-old son Jesse Bongiovi teamed up to give music fans a virtual happy hour performance in mid-August.</p>

<p>The duo created a free event for charity, which included an acoustic performance by Jon and the Kings of Suburbia. </p>

<p>In March, the rockstar revealed that Jacob came down with a form of COVID-19 and whilst he took measures to quarantine himself, his symptoms were not serious.</p>

<p>Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, Jon said: 'The whole family is together, all the kids are here with us. We've been here 15 days now, not that I'm counting.'</p>

<p>'Jake had a mild version of it just the intestinal kind. Dorothea created the quarantine zone... and we kept him in there until all of the symptoms had cleared and now he's a hundred percent.'</p>

<p>Whilst they're convinced the illness Jacob had was coronavirus, they'd been unable to get a test for the teenager as it proved 'pretty difficult' to get hold of one. </p>
