<p>She said the operations included forced contraception, forced abortion and sterilisation, as well as the forced removal of wombs, ITV reported.</p>

<p>She added that on at least one occasion, a 'still-moving' baby was discarded into the rubbish.</p>

<p>The Uighur doctor, who later fled to Turkey, said she 'thought it was my job' and was told to believe it was part of the Communist party's population control plan.</p>

<p>She told ITV: 'We would go village to village, gather all the women and herd them onto tractors. Young women were fitted with contraceptive devices, pregnant women would have to have an abortion then sterilisation.</p>

<p>We even inserted birth control implants into women's upper arms to prevent pregnancy.'</p>

<p>She added that she feels 'such regret' and now helps those who have also fled China for Turkey, working as a doctor in an Istanbul beauty salon.</p>

<p>Many of the women do not know what procedures were done to them and require medical assistance.</p>

<p>One Uighur exile, who smuggled her daughter out of China to Turkey, claimed that she had to hide her pregnancy.</p>

<p>Kalbinur Kamal told ITV: 'I dressed very differently to hide the bump, I pulled in my stomach. I felt so scared and sad.'  </p>

<p>Turkey provides sanctuary to those who have fled from their homeland and is home to around 50,000 Uighurs who left China. </p>

<p>The Chinese Government has detained around one million Uighurs in Xinjiang, holding them in interment camps. </p>

<p>Around 12million Uighurs, who are mostly Muslim, live in China and are an ethnic Turkic minority who speak their own Uighur language.  </p>

<p>Chinese authorities have acknowledged their detainment of Uighurs but insist it is a scheme of education.</p>

<p>Birth rates in the mostly Uighur regions of Hotan and Kashgar plunged by more than 60 per cent from 2015 to 2018, the latest year available in government statistics. </p>

<p>Across the Xinjiang region, birth rates continue to plummet, falling nearly 24 per cent last year alone - compared to just 4.2 per cent nationwide, statistics show.</p>

<p>The campaign to curb the population over the past four years in the far west region of Xinjiang is leading to what some experts are calling a form of 'demographic genocide'. </p>

<p>Hundreds of millions of dollars poured into birth control has transformed Xinjiang from one of China's fastest-growing regions to among its slowest in a few years, according to research obtained by Associated Press prior to publication by China scholar Adrian Zenz.</p>

<p>'This kind of drop is unprecedented....there's a ruthlessness to it,' said Zenz, a leading expert in the policing of China's minority regions. </p>

<p>'This is part of a wider control campaign to subjugate the Uighurs.'</p>

<p>Chinese officials have said in the past that the measures are merely meant to be fair, allowing both Han Chinese and ethnic minorities the same number of children. </p>
