<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham's Carabao Cup clash with Leyton Orient could be in doubt after the League Two club announced that a number of first team players have tested positive for coronavirus. </p>

<p>Orient have said in an official statement that they have informed the EFL and Tottenham and will make an announcement on the status of Tuesday's game shortly.</p>

<p>'We have also informed Mansfield Town, Plymouth Argyle and Oldham Athletic, our three most recent opponents, prior to the public release of this information,' the statement continued.</p>

<p>Leyton Orient have announced that a host of first team players have tested positive for covid</p>

<p>5.1 A Club which is unable to fulfil its obligation to complete a Competition match in Round One to (and including) Round Four due to either:</p>

<p>5.1.1 that Club’s Player(s) having returned a positive CAT result and self-isolating in accordance with the action plan set out in the Return to Play/Return to Training Protocols resulting in the Club not having a sufficient number of Players to fulfil the fixture; or</p>

<p>5.1.2 any requirements or directions of the UK Government and/or by any public authority,</p>

<p>shall forfeit the fixture, pay the opposing Club’s expenses in accordance with Rule 5.8 and the opposing team shall receive a bye into the next round of the Competition.</p>

<p>The League Two club have also closed down their training ground and stadium, putting them both into lockdown just 24 hours before the cup tie.  </p>

<p>'Leyton Orient’s priority is the health and well-being of its players and staff. Those who have tested positive will now strictly follow government self-isolation guidelines. </p>

<p>EFL rules state that a club which is unable to fulfil its obligation to play due to positive covid tests may have to forfeit the fixture, pay the opposing club's expenses, who will receive a bye to the next round.</p>

<p>The breaking news comes after Tottenham announced that they would auction their signed match shirts from the game.</p>

<p>Proceeds from the auction were to go to the JE3 Foundation, set up in memory of former Orient manager Justin Edinburgh, who died of a heart attack last year. </p>
