<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured) said on Friday there was about 24,000 Australians registered to come home as he announced a staged increase in the weekly arrivals cap</p>

<p>The limit on people returning is slated to increase to 6,000 next month. At that rate it would take six months for every registered return traveller to arrive back.</p>

<p>Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet officials said hotel quarantine capability - not the availability of flights - was stopping more people returning.</p>

<p>The latest figures show 35,700 people want to come home.</p>

<p>At that rate it would take six months for every registered return traveller to arrive back. </p>

<p>Deputy secretary Simon Duggan told the committee commercial flights into Australia had about 20,000 spare seats each week.</p>

<p>'The availability of flights has not been the binding constraint on getting Australians home,' he said.</p>

<p>He said the intention was to have everyone on the list back in the country by Christmas.</p>

<p>'Our hope is of course that we're able to bring all Australians home in that time frame, but there are a lot of variables in calculating exactly what that will be,' Mr Duggan said.</p>

<p>Travel ban and caps on weekly arrivals have led to many Australians in vulnerable circumstances being left without a way home.</p>
