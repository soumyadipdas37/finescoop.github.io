<p>Clarification: A representative for The Chase has confirmed to The Daily Telegraph that Andrew was merely wearing a 'dress ring' in the episode</p>

<p>A representative for Andrew also confirmed that he and his girlfriend remain in a loving relationship and that he was still in the process of finalising his divorce from estranged wife, Eleanor. </p>

<p>Andrew and Eleanor separated in 2017. The exes share three children, Barnaby, 15, Rory, 12, and Olivia, eight. </p>

<p>In October last year, the star admitted in an interview with Sunrise that life felt 'meaningless' after he separated from wife Eleanor in late 2017. </p>

<p>'Everyone hits a part of their life where they really question what it's all about and who they really are and what they have done for the last four or five years and whether it means anything,' he said.</p>

<p>'And I think, when I split up with my wife, that was my time, and the thing I always believed in most of all was the power of love and combining with someone to make something special, and when I lost that, I thought it was all meaningless.</p>

<p>He added: 'In life, we have several choices on how to deal with things, and some people work their way through their pain, or turn to alcohol or drugs or eating. </p>

<p>'And I feel very lucky that in this country, we have these institutions and the expertise to be able to deal with those things and get on top of it.'</p>

<p>Things are now back on track for Andrew as he returned behind the lectern to host The Chase Australia in June. </p>

<p>The show recently took a break while Andrew took care of some personal issues. The break was later extended due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Struggles: In October last year, the star admitted in an interview with Sunrise that life felt 'meaningless' after he separated from wife Eleanor in late 2017</p>

<p>Filming of The Chase has stopped a number of times before. In November, Channel Seven gave Andrew time off to accommodate his touring schedule.</p>

<p>In April, the network gave Andrew time off to work on himself, with his manager saying the last year had left him 'emotionally exhausted.' </p>

<p>He later told The Herald Sun that this eight-week break had allowed him to focus on his personal health.</p>

<p>'We all use different methods to escape from the most uncomfortable parts of our existence and I certainly was not using the most healthy ones,' he said.</p>

<p>'I mean sleep would have been handy... The diet could have been better, fluids that had no decimal points in them would have been good.'</p>

<p>He continued: 'I just could not see that I had the time or the strength to change that without removing myself entirely from the world for a bit.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Andrew's representative for comment, in relation to this article. </p>
