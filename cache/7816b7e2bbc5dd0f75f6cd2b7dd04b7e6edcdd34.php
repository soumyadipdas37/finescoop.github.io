<p>The campaign champions raw confidence, celebrates individual freedom, embraces diversity and encourages women to step towards a more sustainable future.</p>

<p>Shot and directed by award-winning Sydney-based director Dani Pearce, the one-minute script follows the journey of multiple women, each with their own nuance and story as they embrace the new way to period. </p>

<p>'When it comes to our period, we've always been made to feel a certain way. We've been made to feel gross,' the video's narrator said and shows a bed sheet hanging out of a washing machine with a circular red blood stain.</p>

<p>Another shot shows a bin overflowing with tissues that are also blood-stained and a woman washing her ModiBodi underwear in the shower. </p>

<p>Modibodi CEO and Founder Kristy Chong said: 'Advertising for personal hygiene products has come a long way in the seven years since we started Modibodi; but many brands still feel the need to hide or gloss over the very natural process of having your period.'</p>

<p>'We've used red to represent blood from day one. The New Way to Period shows the real side of menstruation and reminds women they're allowed to feel however they want when they have their period and that there are better options than eco-damaging disposable pads, liners and tampons.</p>

<p>'We hope this film opens the viewers mind to a new period experience. It's the twenty-first century and Modibodi's sustainable, leak-proof underwear and apparel is here to help people feel comfortable, confident and fiercely themselves,' she said.</p>

<p>The campaign champions raw confidence, celebrates individual freedom, embraces diversity and encourages women to step towards a more sustainable future</p>

<p>The advertisement launched on September 16 across multiple platforms, including regional free to air and subscription TV, and is already being praised by women on social media</p>

<p>Emotive Creative Director, Jardin Anderson, said: 'It's been a pleasure to help herald in 'the new way to period' with a brand bold enough to lean into the beauty of normality and eschew all the hyperbole so often seen in this category.</p>

<p>'Director Dani Pearce understood straight away the tone we wanted to achieve and was the perfect person to bring this story to life.' </p>

<p>The brand hopes the advertisement will make a change and 'navigate a new direction' regarding how periods are perceived and discussed.</p>
