<p>Full relaxation mode: Bar Refaeli confidently displayed her toned abs in a khaki green bikini as she chilled on a hammock on Wednesday</p>

<p>Bar proudly showed off her physique in the tiny green bikini top and matching bottoms as she reclined in the hammock.</p>

<p>The star was clearly ready to relax as she penned the caption: '5 minutes before a really serious,' followed by a sleep emoji.</p>

<p>The post comes after Bar and her mother have been convicted of tax evasion after a court appearance in Israel.</p>

<p>The star and her mother, Tzipi, confessed to evading paying taxes on income nearing $10million (£8million), which brought the prolonged case to its conclusion. </p>

<p>Glowing: The model, 35, looked radiant in skimpy two-pieces as she shared sun-drenched snaps with her fans on Instagram</p>

<p>According to a plea bargain agreement they signed with authorities last month, Bar is to serve nine months of community service while her mother will be sent to prison for 16 months. </p>

<p>The two are also ordered to pay a $1.5million fine on top of the millions of back taxes owed to the state. </p>

<p>The heart of the case revolves around Bar's residence several years ago when she flew around the world in high-profile modelling campaigns, graced the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition and had a lengthy romantic relationship with actor Leonardo DiCaprio. </p>

<p>Israeli tax law determines residency primarily upon whether the person spent most of the calendar year in the country.</p>

<p>Controversy: The posts come after Bar and her mother have been convicted of tax evasion after a court appearance in Israel</p>

<p>Bar claimed that she had not and therefore did not have to declare her worldwide income in certain years.</p>

<p>But prosecutors rejected her claim and charged her with providing incorrect tax information.</p>

<p>For instance, Bar's indictment said she earned some $7.2 million between the years 2009 and 2012 while claiming to reside overseas to avoid paying taxes on her income.</p>

<p>In previous appeals, an Israeli court ruled that Refaeli's relationship with DiCaprio did not qualify as a 'family unit,' and therefore she could not claim his American residence to avoid paying the full taxes she owed.</p>

<p>Refaeli's lawyers said the plea bargain proved she had not intentionally evaded tax payments.</p>

<p>Refaeli's mother, who also acted as her agent, was charged with failure to report income, avoiding paying taxes and aiding someone else in evading tax payments.</p>

<p>The indictment said she signed leases for her daughter under the names of other family members to blur Refaeli's actual residency status and refrained from declaring her own income as her daughter's agent.</p>

<p>The prolonged case, built around the celebrity model's worldwide income and the family's attempts to downplay her ties to Israel, damaged her well-crafted public image as an informal ambassador for the country.</p>

<p>But she remains a popular TV personality and last year, even hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in Tel Aviv. </p>

<p>Drama: The blonde has agreed to do nine months of community service, and pay a $750,000 fine along with $2.8million in back taxes while her mother (pictured in 2016) will go to jail</p>
