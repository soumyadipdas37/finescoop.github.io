<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David De Gea has joined the ranks of VAR detractors, hitting out at the technology for an 'unfair' ruling that cost Manchester United at Crystal Palace.    </p>

<p>In the 74th minute at Selhurst Park the Spaniard was in the way of Jordan Ayew's weak spot-kick after Victor Lindelof was penalised for a dubious handball.   </p>

<p>De Gea pounced on the ball and rushed out to start an attack but play was brought back again, with VAR ordering the referee to award a re-take because the keeper had leaned in front of his goal-line before Ayew connected with the ball. </p>

<p>David de Gea was furious at VAR's decision to award Crystal Palace a second penalty </p>

<p>The Spaniard saved Jordan Ayew's first effort but was judged to have crossed the goal-line</p>

<p>De Gea stepped forwards too early before Ayew had struck the ball, which VAR picked up </p>

<p>'I understand this new rule for the penalties has been implemented but it was already difficult to save a penalty even with the option to lean forwards,' the Spaniard told BT Sport. </p>

<p>'If the person who has taken the penalty misses I don’t get that they could swap the player that takes it. You are taking the pressure away from the player who took and missed the first time. </p>

<p>'So you offer the chance for someone else to take the pen, who will not have the same pressure as the one who took the first one. </p>

<p>Wilfred Zaha then scored the second attempt, with De Gea claiming the rule is 'unfair' </p>

<p>The defeat marks a poor start to the Premier League season for United after pre-season hype</p>

<p>'But, hey, that’s the rule. I think it is a little unfair.  </p>

<p>'It was just a tiny bit that I leaned forward. So for me, it was a good save. But it had to be taken again and I almost saved it again too.' </p>

<p>De Gea has been facing pressure for his starting spot after a blip in his career last season, with high-profile mistakes costing United. </p>

<p>Dean Henderson, back from his loan at Sheffield United, will be keeping the pressure on his more experienced team-mate this season, who believes he will maintain Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's backing.   </p>

<p>'I have a lot of confidence from the gaffer and also from the club, from the teammates,' he added. </p>

<p>De Gea is confident he can see off the challenge of Dean Henderson for his spot in the line-up</p>

<p>'I have been here many years now, I have a lot of experience and I think I have been at a very good level for a lot of time now.</p>

<p>'I am happy to be here and I hope I can remain the number one for this club for a long time.'</p>
