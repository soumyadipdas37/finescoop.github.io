<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andrew Neil has said there were times he was 'unhappy' at the BBC, but that he is not out to 'seek revenge' as he leaves to help launch GB News.</p>

<p>The broadcaster, 71, will be the face and chairman of the 24-hour TV channel, signalling the end of his relationship with the BBC, where he has been one of the most respected political interviewers.</p>

<p>Plans are in place for 'Britain's news channel', aimed at those who feel 'under-served and unheard by their media', to launch early next year.</p>

<p>Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Neil said he moved on from the BBC in an 'amicable way'.</p>

<p>Asked about his relationship with the broadcaster, he said: 'You will have to ask the BBC that. I don't really want to look back, I have enjoyed my years at the BBC.</p>

<p>'I have been surrounded by some of the most talented people in broadcasting.</p>

<p>'There have been times where I have been unhappy at how the BBC has treated me.</p>

<p>'They wouldn't move This Week to a better time slot, it was getting closer and closer to midnight.</p>

<p>'They cancelled the Andrew Neil Show even though it was beating Channel 4 news every time it was on.'</p>

<p>Neil said the new director-general of the BBC, Tim Davie, had presented him with a number of offers but that they had felt like a 'step back'.</p>

<p>He added: 'The new DG came up with some really good offers at the end but they weren't quite good enough.</p>

<p>'I felt it was a bit of step back, too much water had flowed under the bridge. It was time to move on and I do so in an amicable way.</p>

<p>'I'm not out to seek revenge. I'm not going to do a John Humphrys in which you leave the BBC with glowing reports, then 24 hours later you beat up on the BBC. That's not my style.'</p>

<p>GB News will not be a rolling news channel like those offered by Sky and the BBC, but will be similar to US networks MSNBC and Fox News, Neil told hosts Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.</p>

<p>He said: 'There would be no point doing what is already being done pretty well with the existing incumbents. It will not be a rolling news channel.</p>

<p>'It will be based more like MSNBC in America, which is on the left, and Fox, which is on the right.</p>

<p>'You know, Piers, as well as I do, they don't do rolling news. They do news when it breaks but they don't do continuous rolling news.</p>

<p>'They segment the day into individual programmes, news-based programmes, built around very strong presenters, or anchors as they call them in the United States, and that is what we will do.</p>

<p>'Anchors with a bit of edge, a bit of attitude, personality - and people will make an appointment to view them.'</p>

<p>At a time when the BBC and commercial media companies are cutting jobs, GB News said it hopes to create at least 120 positions.</p>

<p>They include more than 100 journalists in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland with the channel, in which global media and entertainment company Discovery Inc is the lead investor.</p>

<p>GB News will feature more than 6,500 hours of content a year, made exclusively for the channel, which has secured broadcasting licences from Ofcom.</p>

<p>It has been founded by media executives Andrew Cole and Mark Schneider.</p>

<p>They plan for the channel to reach 96% of British television households via Freeview, Sky and Virgin Media.</p>

<p>GB News will broadcast seven days a week across the UK and Ireland and will be available globally on GB News digital platforms.</p>

<p>Sky launched a 24-hour news channel in 1989 and the BBC followed, in the UK, in 1997.</p>

<p>Former Sky News executive editor John McAndrew will be director of news and programming and ex-Sky News Australia chief executive Angelos Frangopoulos has been appointed chief executive officer.</p>

<p>GB News said that more announcements will be made in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The BBC confirmed this summer that Neil's self-titled show would not return to TV screens</p>

<p>Media mogul Rupert Murdoch is also said to be planning the launch of a TV station.</p>

<p>Neil said: 'They tried to get me to join and do that, but in the end I decided not to.</p>

<p>'I left Rupert Murdoch's organisation 25 years ago and it didn't seem to me like a sensible career move to go back.</p>

<p>'The offer they made very generous and very professional and so on.'</p>

<p>The BBC previously thanked Neil for his work at the corporation and wished him luck in his new role.</p>

<p>A statement following his initial announcement said: 'We'd like to give our heartfelt thanks to Andrew for his many years of work for the BBC, during which he's informed and entertained millions of viewers.</p>

<p>'From his early broadcasting days on Despatch Box in the 1990s to his recent forensic and agenda-setting political interviews, be has proved a formidable and hugely talented broadcaster.</p>

<p>'For years, he was at the heart of the irreverent and much-loved This Week and played a key role in the Daily and Sunday Politics, Politics Live and the BBC's general election coverage.</p>

<p>'We wish Andrew every success in his new role; we're sorry the US election coverage will be his last BBC presentation work for the foreseeable future but he will always be welcome at the BBC.'</p>
