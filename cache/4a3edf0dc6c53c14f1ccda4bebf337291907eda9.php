<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pearson has been rocked by an embarrassing shareholder revolt over a lavish pay packet handed to its new boss.</p>

<p>The education publisher came under fire for agreeing to give Andy Bird, 56, a 'golden hello' worth £7million and another £185,000 to go towards the rent of an apartment in New York. He will also earn up to £5.9million a year.</p>

<p>Ahead of a meeting to approve his appointment yesterday, shareholders had complained of being 'held to ransom' by Pearson and complained that the package was far too generous.</p>

<p>Pearson has come under fire for agreeing to give Andy Bird, 56, a 'golden hello' worth £7million and another £185,000 to go towards the rent of an apartment in New York</p>

<p>Eyebrows were also raised after it emerged Bird - who was previously a non-executive director – had interviewed other potential chief executive candidates before deciding to put himself forward. </p>

<p>He is a media industry veteran who previously ran Walt Disney's international arm, and will be tasked with beefing up Pearson's digital business.</p>

<p>But advisory services ISS and Glass Lewis had both urged shareholders to oppose Bird's appointment, saying his golden hello had not been properly justified. </p>

<p>It prompted a rebellion at the meeting, with 33 per cent of votes cast against his pay, although Pearson's plan was still approved overall. </p>

<p>And the significant level of opposition was noted by the company in a statement afterwards.</p>

<p>Throughout the row, Pearson has insisted Bird is the best man for the job – even going so far as to call him a 'rare' talent – and worth the hefty pay packet. </p>

<p>Yesterday it added that it had 'engaged extensively with shareholders during this process' and would 'continue to engage' with them.</p>

<p>Pearson has endured a tumultuous four years as it adapts from selling textbooks via book shops to online courseware. </p>

<p>Outgoing boss John Fallon, who Bird will replace next month, cut thousands of jobs, sold assets and issued a string of profit warnings during his tenure.</p>

<p>Bird will continue living in California, splitting his time between there and New York.</p>

<p>With Pearson's biggest slice of sales coming from the US, analysts have suggested this could help him arrest the difficulties it has been having in North America.</p>
