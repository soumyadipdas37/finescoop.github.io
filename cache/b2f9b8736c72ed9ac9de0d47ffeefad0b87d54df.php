<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Iranian wrestling champion has been sentenced to death for taking part in protests against the regime in 2018. </p>

<p>Iran's Supreme Court confirmed two death sentences for Navid Afkari along with six years and six months in prison and 74 lashes, according to Persian-language broadcaster Iran International.  </p>

<p>His brother, Vahid Afkari, received a prison sentence of 54  years, while a third brother, Habib, was given 27 years and both will receive 74 lashes. </p>

<p>Iran's judiciary charged the brothers with 20 different crimes including 'attending illegal gatherings, assembly and conspiracy to commit crimes against national security, and insulting the supreme leader.'  </p>

<p>Navid (left) and his brother Vahid (right) were sentenced by Iran's supreme court along with a third brother, Habib </p>

<p>A source close to the brothers said Navid, a wrestling champion with no criminal record, and his siblings had joined in the protests 'so the judiciary deemed the participation of all three brothers as the organisation of a group'. </p>

<p>Iran International reported that Navid and Vahid Afkari were severely tortured to give confessions. </p>

<p>The US government made similar claims, alleging that 'Khamenei's thugs tortured Navid to the point that he confessed to fake crimes'.</p>

<p>'Those who were not satisfied with trampling on Navid's human dignity have now sentenced him to death,' a Persian-language statement said.  </p>

<p>The court even heard testimony from witnesses who described the beatings and torture, it is claimed, but judges ignored it.  </p>

<p>An Iranian opposition group quoted their mother Bahieh Namjou as saying the brothers had been arrested by plain-clothes officers without a warrant. </p>

<p>British-Iranian actress Nazanin Boniadi pleaded with Iran not to execute the brothers, saying: 'Champion wrestler Navid Afkari has been sentenced to death for participating in anti-government protests in Iran. </p>

<p>'Those close to him have said he was subjected to a forced confession under torture. Stop executions in Iran.'</p>

<p>According to Amnesty International, Iran is already the world's second-most prolific user of the death penalty after China, with at least 251 executions in 2019. </p>

<p>Amnesty said some people were executed in public, while several of the condemned prisoners were under 18 at the time of the alleged crime.  </p>

<p>The human rights charity also alleged there were 'systematic violations of fair trial rights' in Iran.  </p>

<p>Last month Iran's judiciary halted the executions of three young men convicted in connection with November's mass anti-government protests.   </p>

<p>The #Don'tExecute campaign erupted after three men - Amirhossein Moradi, Saeed Tamjidi and Mohammad Rajabi - were sentenced to death on charges of taking part in arson and vandalism during the 2019 protests.</p>

<p>An Iranian opposition group quoted their mother Bahieh Namjou (pictured) as saying the brothers had been arrested by plain-clothes officers without a warrant</p>

<p>Sadeq Saba, the editor of Iran International, said: 'The Islamic Republic has witnessed many protest movements over the years, most recently in mid-November over petrol price rises. </p>

<p>'Security forces brutally killed hundreds of people and detained thousands more. These movements have become more radical, more frequent and have spread across Iran.'</p>

<p>He added: 'In response to internal and external pressures, the regime has adopted a bunker mentality, evolving into an authoritarian-theocratic centralised state presided over by an all-powerful supreme leader with no respect for constitutionalism.'</p>

<p>Many of the recent protests have been set off by economic hardships, in a country where many people have struggled to make ends meet because of US sanctions. </p>

<p>Further protests erupted last year after an announcement that gas prices would rise by as much as 200 per cent.</p>

<p>The US drone strike that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in January 2020 initially led to an outpouring of grief and nationalism in Iran. </p>

<p>But the public anger turned against the regime after blundering Revolutionary Guards shot down a passenger plane with dozens of Iranians on board. </p>

<p>The stand-off with the US eventually calmed, and political tensions were soon superseded by the coronavirus crisis in which Iran was an early hotspot.  </p>
