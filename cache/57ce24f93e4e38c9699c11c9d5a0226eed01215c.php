<p>Bill and Cristal Tsouvalas were living in South Africa when the coronavirus pandemic gripped the world and Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to come home on March 23.</p>

<p>The couple, originally from Adelaide, have struggled to bring their nine-month-old daughter Penelope to Australia so she can have surgery for a heart defect ever since, The Advertiser reported.</p>

<p>'My No 1 priority is getting my daughter back to Australia as soon as possible,' Mr Tsouvalas said. </p>

<p>The family have had numerous flights back to Australia cancelled, including a business-class booking that cost $23,000.</p>

<p>The family family was granted a repatriation flight but were turned away in Pretoria when they arrived.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged Australians to come home in March, during the initial peak of COVID-19 but Mr Tsouvalas said it wasn't easy to return at that time as his family had to pack up their lives first.</p>

<p>Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there</p>

<p>NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction</p>

<p>Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT</p>

<p>Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open</p>

<p>Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption </p>

<p>He also slammed the 'unfair' caps on how many people can return to Australia in a week, suggesting that airlines should be allowed to manage this instead. </p>

<p>The caps were introduced in July and further tightened last month, when it was declared only 4,000 Australians could return home every week.</p>

<p>Cities such as Melbourne and Hobart aren't taking any international arrivals at this stage.</p>

<p>Brisbane and Adelaide have a limit of 500 international arrivals per week while Perth's weekly limit is 525.</p>

<p>Canberra and Darwin's limit varies on a week-by-week basis following discussions with other states and territories.</p>

<p>Sydney has a limit of 350 passengers per day.</p>

<p>There are also strict rules for when Australians can leave the country, which are dictated by the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

<p>You can only leave if you have been granted an exemption by the department.  </p>

<p>These include whether your travel is in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, such as the provision of aid, if it is essential to business, for medical treatment or urgent and unavoidable personal business. </p>

<p>Other reasons include if your travel is of national interest, if it is on humanitarian grounds and 'urgent and unavoidable personal business'.</p>

<p>No one can leave the country without an exemption based on the mentioned reasons. </p>

<p>Further restrictions on travel in to Australia were introduced by the Morrison Government on July 10 on how many people could return to Australia each week. Pictured: People being taken to hotel quarantine after landing in Sydney on August 23</p>
