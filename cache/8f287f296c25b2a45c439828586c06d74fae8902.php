<p>But Brandi, 47, claims that after they slept together Denise freaked out saying her husband Aaron would kill her if he ever found out - even though she had claimed they had an open relationship.</p>

<p>The current RHOBH season has been roiled by drama after Brandi first revealed the affair on camera, first exclusively revealed by DailyMail.com. </p>

<p>Brandi Glanville has lifted the lid on her salacious affair with Denise Richards revealing she first became intimate with her Real Housewives of Beverly Hills co-star TEN days after Denise married her husband Aaron Phypers</p>

<p>In an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, Brandi spilled all the juicy details of the secret tryst, revealing how 'sexually aggressive' Denise instigated the affair by demanding to see her breasts before throwing her up against a bathroom wall in a restaurant and kissing her passionately</p>

<p>But Brandi, 47, claims that after they slept together Denise freaked out saying Aaron would kill her if he ever found out - even though she had claimed her and her husband had an open relationship. 'I felt she wanted to hit it and quit it. She was very sexually aggressive and once she got what she wanted, she didn't want to know,' explained Brandi</p>

<p>Asked for a response to Brandi's slew of accusations, a representative for Denise simply said: 'Not true'. </p>

<p>Brandi says Denise, 49, has even threatened her with legal action, issuing a cease and desist letter in a bid to keep her silent.</p>

<p>'I really didn't think it was going to be as huge as it is. It's literally everywhere,' says Brandi.</p>

<p>'However, I think the denial with Denise has made it a huge deal, especially since it's all over Housewives.</p>

<p>'All I'm interested in is getting the truth out there.'</p>

<p>Brandi first met Denise on September 18, 2018 at Rande Gerber's upscale Café Habana restaurant in Malibu.</p>

<p>Brandi had just left the Celebrity Big Brother House and her agent told her he was taking on Denise as a client and wanted them to meet so Brandi could give her some advice about appearing on RHOBH.</p>

<p>'We went to dinner and Denise is sitting across from me and the whole time she is looking at my boobs,' recalls Brandi.</p>

<p>'Then our agent left because it was getting late for him, but we stayed because we were having a great time, we were hitting it off.</p>

<p>'And then Denise said to me: "Oh my God, does it seem like I've been looking at your boobs all night?" I'm like, "yeah, pretty much".'</p>

<p>Brandi says mom-of-three Denise then asked to see her breasts in the bathroom because the actress was considering getting hers redone by a surgeon.</p>

<p>The pair had been drinking heavily; Denise tequila and Brandi wine.</p>

<p>'We went into the bathroom and I showed her my boobs and right when I took my shirt down, she just kind of threw me against the wall and started making out with me,' recalls Brandi.</p>

<p>Brandi first met Denise on September 18, 2018. Denise said to me: "Oh my God, does it seem like I've been looking at your boobs all night?" I'm like, "yeah, pretty much".' Brandi says Denise then asked to see her breasts in the bathroom because the actress was considering getting hers redone. 'We went into the bathroom and I showed her my boobs and right when I took my shirt down, she just kind of threw me against the wall and started making out with me,' recalls Brandi. Brandi says the two of them didn't really see each other until they shot a scene together for RHOBH in November that year (left and right) </p>

<p>Brandi said Denise did say she wanted to see her again, however, and it wasn't long before she was bombarding the beauty with texts. Pictured: Brandi texting Denise a photo of her breasts, telling her who the surgeon was</p>

<p>Brandi added: 'And I was down for it, I honestly didn't mind. I was like, okay, what are we doing, but this is fun. </p>

<p>'We were drunk and it's not the first time I've made out with a friend or a girl. I was flattered, it was a compliment. She's a beautiful girl. She's Denise Richards.</p>

<p>'We had a good time and then we went back to the table and had more drinks.'</p>

<p>Brandi says Denise then came on heavy.</p>

<p>'She said to me, "Oh my God, I always wanted to f<strong>k the s</strong>t out of you. And I was like, what? 'But I was going with it. I was having a good time.'</p>

<p>The former fashion model reveals the two women went back to the bathroom for a second time and things became even steamier.</p>

<p>'We were just making out, I had jeans on. There was nothing other than like a little bit of ti**y sucking, but it was sexy,' she said.</p>

<p>When the women, by now heavily intoxicated, decided to leave, Brandi said she left her car behind and ordered an Uber for herself but Denise insisted on driving herself home.</p>

<p>'We were both so drunk. I walked her across the street to her car, where the Ralph's parking lot was, and we made out a little bit again in her car and then this car comes driving up and she's like, "Oh my God it's paparazzi, it's paparazzi, get down".</p>

<p>'I'm like, "I think it's my Uber, babe". There was a little paranoia there. And before we left she was like, "Oh my God, I hope that you would never tell anyone about this, my personal life is my personal life. I trust you".</p>

<p>'To me it was not a big deal, two girls getting drunk and making out, but of course I didn't know she was married at this point, she never mentioned Aaron once.'</p>

<p>Brandi said Denise did say she wanted to see her again, however, and it wasn't long before she was bombarding the beauty with texts.</p>

<p>'It was nonstop from her after the first night we met,' recalls Brandi. 'She wanted to finish what she started, that's how I felt.'</p>

<p>Brandi said: 'To me it was not a big deal, two girls getting drunk and making out, but of course I didn't know she was married at this point, she never mentioned Aaron once.' Denise married husband Aaron on September 8, 2018. </p>

<p>But Brandi says she fobbed Denise off with a string of excuses so things wouldn't go too far.</p>

<p>'She was literally texting me every single day. "Oh, I'm in your neighborhood, can I just come over? Can I come over? I need to see you".</p>

<p>'I said, well, "I can meet you for a drink, I can meet you at dinner". I just didn't want to be alone with her, because I felt that she had a lot of dude energy, like she really wanted me.</p>

<p>'I felt almost like it was a guy that wanted to hit it and quit it. Like he wanted to get what he wanted, but this was Denise.</p>

<p>'All I wanted was a new friend that I liked, that was cool and drank. I really was not looking for any kind of sexual partner, I felt like I was running from her.'</p>

<p>Brandi says the two of them didn't really see each other until they shot a scene together for RHOBH in November that year.</p>

<p>And immediately after filming ended Brandi was given an insight into the alleged open marriage Denise has with husband Aaron.</p>

<p>'After filming we were like, 'let's just go out and party",' Brandi recalls.</p>

<p>'We went back to the scene of the crime Café Habana and her husband Aaron met up with us and we were all getting very hammered.'</p>

<p>Brandi claims it wasn't long before the newly married couple began openly talking about having threesomes with other women.</p>

<p>She also claims her first intimate encounter with Denise was brought up and Aaron was fully aware.</p>

<p>She said: 'They got on the subject of how do they get other women to come into their marriage and into their bed? They asked if I could help them? And I'm like, "um, call Charlie Sheen".</p>

<p>'All night we talked about sex and how he (Aaron) was okay as long as she was with a girl, she could never be with a guy.</p>

<p>'It was an interesting conversation and it just made me feel like, okay, these are very sexual people that are very open.'</p>

<p>Brandi says she fobbed Denise off with a string of excuses so things wouldn't go too far. 'She was literally texting me every single day. I just didn't want to be alone with her, because I felt that she had a lot of dude energy, like she really wanted me.' Pictured: Brandi and Denise on the 2019 trip Brandi claims they had sex </p>

<p>DailyMailTV has seen dozens of text exchanges between the two women which show they had a very close friendship</p>

<p>Brandi says that after that meeting Denise carried on pursuing her over text. 'We spoke a lot but I continued to make myself unavailable,' Brandi said</p>

<p>At some point in the night Brandi and Denise locked lips and took a photo that was sent to Andy Cohen and later posted on Twitter on June 27 this year.</p>

<p>Brandi says that after that meeting Denise carried on pursuing her over text.</p>

<p>DailyMailTV has seen dozens of text exchanges between the two women which show they had a very close friendship.</p>

<p>'We spoke a lot but I continued to make myself unavailable,' Brandi said.</p>

<p>And it wouldn't be until late April 2019 that the two women would see each other again.</p>

<p>Brandi said she wanted Denise to appear on her podcast, which at the time was her only income, but Denise was out of town filming a movie.</p>

<p>'She was filming with her ex Patrick Muldoon and Denise suggested I come to the set in Mendocino, I was reluctant at first but I knew Denise being on my podcast would do really well, so I agreed, I have to put food on the table.</p>

<p>'I did feel a little bit like it was her way of finally getting me alone, but I knew what I was getting myself into.</p>

<p>'It's not that I didn't like Denise, I just didn't want to have sex with her.'</p>

<p>Brandi flew to Mendocino, a beautiful coastal town in northern California, and stayed in a cottage with Denise at the Mendocino Hotel.</p>

<p>Denise had been filming the Christmas movie My Adventures with Santa in which her and her ex Patrick played husband and wife.</p>

<p>And it wouldn't be until late April 2019 that the two women would see each other again. Brandi flew to Mendocino, a beautiful coastal town in northern California, and stayed in a cottage with Denise at the Mendocino Hotel. Pictured: Denise inviting Brandi to stay with her </p>

<p>Brandi recalled that after a night of drinking with Denise: 'I was really ready to pass out. And the next thing I know we're making out, she's on top of me and our clothes are off. And yeah, we're going at it, we had sex.' Pictured: Denise showing Brandi the hotel she was at </p>

<p>Brandi admits she bit Denise several in the throes of passion in what she claims was an attempt to put her off sex. 'It's not that I don't think she's a beautiful, attractive woman. I just put myself in a situation that I didn't want to be in,' she explained. Brandi admits she went to Mendocino with her eyes open though, saying: 'I put myself in that situation, so I'm not a victim'</p>

<p>Denise, who had her daughter and her daughter's friend staying with her, had promised Brandi a roll away bed to sleep on but one never materialized.</p>

<p>'When I arrived, I met up with her and Patrick and we all hit it off and were having a great time,' she said.</p>

<p>'Patrick and I were just being silly and we started kissing. I think in a weird way, I was making out with him just to put off having to make out with Denise.'</p>

<p>Denise went to bed early to phone her husband so when Brandi came to bed she was already asleep.</p>

<p>The following day, Denise went off to film and Brandi looked around Mendocino with her daughter and friend.</p>

<p>After Denise and Patrick finished on set the trio started drinking and Brandi recorded a podcast with Patrick in his hotel room.</p>

<p>'I thought it was great. We were all wildly drunk, and Patrick said, "so did you hook up with Denise last night after you left me?"</p>

<p>'And I said, no, what are you talking about? But he said, "Brandi, I dated the girl for five years, I know she likes girls".</p>

<p>'That night we all got even more drunk than the night before and went back to Denise's cottage. 'The girls were asleep in their room.</p>

<p>'Patrick went back to his room and Denise and I went upstairs.</p>

<p>'I was really ready to pass out. And the next thing I know we're making out, she's on top of me and our clothes are off. And yeah, we're going at it, we had sex.</p>

<p>'But Denise said to me, "I don't understand, you seem like you're not into it". And I wasn't, I just didn't want to do it.'</p>

<p>But the morning after they slept together she was shocked by Denise's reaction. 'She was like, "wow, you left marks all over my body and Aaron, if he ever finds out, he's gonna kill me. He can never find out". I literally did a double take and I was silent for a few minutes. I am not good with secrets. They make me uncomfortable.' Pictured: Brandi texting Denise after word spread that the two women had slept together </p>

<p>Pictured: Denise denying she ever brought her name up to her RHOBHc co-stars</p>

<p>Denise texted Brandi: 'I was shocked at the stuff they had said... There is still time that you and I can fix this so our families don't have to endure this bulls**t'</p>

<p>Denise texted Brandi: 'It's apparent that you &amp; I are scapegoats for their drama at the potential expense of our kids... They do not care about our children and families and they'll stop at nothing'</p>

<p>Brandi admits she bit Denise several in the throes of passion in what she claims was an attempt to put her off sex.</p>

<p>'It's not that I don't think she's a beautiful, attractive woman. I just put myself in a situation that I didn't want to be in,' she explained.</p>

<p>Brandi admits she went to Mendocino with her eyes open though, saying: 'I put myself in that situation, so I'm not a victim.'</p>

<p>But the morning after they slept together she was shocked by Denise's reaction.</p>

<p>'She was like, "wow, you left marks all over my body and Aaron, if he ever finds out, he's gonna kill me. He can never find out".</p>

<p>'I literally did a double take and I was silent for a few minutes. I am not good with secrets. They make me uncomfortable.</p>

<p>'And as far as I was aware Aaron was one million per cent aware that Denise and I made out the first night we met because we talked about it.</p>

<p>'He also knew I was going to Mendocino and I was sleeping in the same bed as her, so I was shocked by what she was saying.'</p>

<p>That day Brandi, Denise, Patrick and the two girls went horseback riding and Brandi processed what had happened.</p>

<p>When she got home she also told her closest friends what went down.</p>

<p>'You know, the conclusion I came to was that Aaron wouldn't care less about it but this was her way of having something over me and making sure I never talk about it to anyone else,' she said.</p>

<p>Brandi, who has two teenage boys with her ex-husband Eddie Cibrian, says following that weekend she did not see Denise for more than six months because she made herself 'unavailable'.</p>

<p>'The first time I saw her was on Housewives in November and I was so nervous because I didn't know whether to be like, "screw you" or to shut up and not let anyone know because I was ashamed,' she said.</p>

<p>'And I thought people were going to judge me - you're a cheater, you're sleeping with a married woman. And so I had this weight on my shoulders.'</p>

<p>When rumors of her affair with Brandi first circulated earlier this year Denise bluntly denied them, telling Entertainment Tonight: 'I was very much caught off guard, and the subject matter that seems to be in all the tabloids of late is - I think it's kind of disgusting that they even talk about it'</p>

<p>In an episode aired in June this year the housewives later confront Denise in Rome about the alleged affair, to which she tearfully responds: 'What the f***?' (pictured) </p>

<p>Later in the show some of the RHOBH cast struggled to believe Brandi's claims, but when she produced a series of text messages proving her and Denise were close most of the women began to back her</p>

<p>And it was after a drunken sleep over at Brandi's close friend and RHOBH veteran star Kim Richards that the truth came out.</p>

<p>Brandi said she confided in Kim about the affair because she felt safe.</p>

<p>But Kim knew the revelation was a bombshell for the show so convinced her to say something.</p>

<p>Brandi dropped the bombshell news at a sit-down dinner with the rest of the RHOBH cast.</p>

<p>'I f***ed her, woke up the next morning [and] she said, "Aaron can never know this. He'll kill me",' Brandi told Kyle Richards, Dorit Kemsley, Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave, Lisa Rina and Erika Girardi on the show — seemingly before Denise's arrival.</p>

<p>The women were all in shock following the reveal.</p>

<p>In an episode aired in June this year the housewives later confront Denise in Rome about the alleged affair, to which she tearfully responds: 'What the f***?'</p>

<p>'That is not true,' says Denise. Denise's rep also denied the affair to multiple media outlets who followed up on the story at the time.</p>

<p>Later in the show some of the RHOBH cast struggled to believe Brandi's claims, but when she produced a series of text messages proving her and Denise were close most of the women began to back her.</p>

<p>'I think as far as Kyle, Kim, Lisa Rina and Erika go, they know I'm a straight shooter. They know I'm not going to make anything up,' says Brandi.</p>

<p>'Dorit, I can't even speak about, but I said, listen, here you go, look at all of the messages please.</p>

<p>'And they were like, okay, Denise is 100 percent lying. And it really did feel like, "Oh my gosh, thank God somebody believes me".</p>

<p>Brandi said: 'I was super shocked when Denise said that she was leaving the show. She's a strong woman. She said she wanted closure all year, so sit down with me and get closure. 'I think that she just needs more of a narrative that she can control. And you know what, maybe she's just not built for reality television.' She added: 'I just want to know why she made up all the lies.'</p>

<p>Denise joined the cast of the RHOBH in 2018 during the popular reality series' ninth season on Bravo. She recently announced she would not be returning </p>

<p>Brandi calls Denise a 'coward' and says she's 'playing a part' on the show, but she's now been found out.</p>

<p>'But that's something they choose to, and I've had worse things said so I can rise above it. I have a very solid marriage and my husband and I, we just rise above it. People will say what they'll say, and in the big picture, we can't worry about that stuff.'</p>

<p>Denise was asked whether she had told Aaron about the claims Brandi made, and Denise said 'yes.'</p>

<p>'Aaron and I don't have any secrets from each other, and if I did come home and say, ''Hey, I slept with Brandi,'' he would be like, ''How come I wasn't invited?'',' she emphasized.</p>

<p>Brandi said: 'I was super shocked when Denise said that she was leaving the show. She's a strong woman. She said she wanted closure all year, so sit down with me and get closure.</p>
