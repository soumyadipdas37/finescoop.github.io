<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rosie Jacobs, the ex-wife of former Today show weatherman Steve Jacobs, has revealed she has been undergoing a secret health battle. </p>

<p>Rosie, 41, told News.com.au that she decided to trim her brunette locks after she contracted dengue fever while living in Vanuatu with her family.</p>

<p>'When I was living in Vanuatu, I unfortunately contracted dengue fever, which is something that is similar to malaria. It's a mosquito-born virus that's really common in tropical environments,' she began.</p>

<p>Revealed! Rose Jacobs, the ex-wife of former Today show weatherman Steve Jacobs, has revealed the private health battle behind her drastic makeover which saw her swap her brunette locks (left, in February 2015) for a short, Pixie cut (right, in May 2020)</p>

<p>'The reason I cut my hair initially was that I actually had a health situation which most people don't know about,' the mother-of-two explained. </p>

<p>Rose explained it was much easier to maintain shorter locks and feel comfortable amid Vanuatu's soaring temperatures.</p>

<p>'I was extremely unwell for a period of time,' she said.</p>

<p>New look: Rose, 41, told news.com.au that she decided to trim her brunette locks after she contracted dengue fever while living in Vanuatu with her family</p>

<p>The former Channel 10 star relocated from Sydney to Vanuatu in 2017 with her then-husband Steve, in a 'last-ditch' attempt to work on their marriage.</p>

<p>It comes just days after Rosie announced that she had landed a corporate hosting gig with Adviser Ratings, a company that helps people find qualified financial advice.</p>

<p>She shared a photo to Instagram of herself presenting the Together Australia web series, and told her followers she was 'beyond delighted' to be in front of the camera again after a long hiatus.</p>

<p>'When I was living in Vanuatu, I unfortunately contracted dengue fever, which is something that is similar to malaria. It's a mosquito-born virus that's really common in tropical environments,' she said </p>

<p>Rosie looks very different these days compared to just a few years ago when she was married to Steve, the affable 53-year-old weatherman who worked for Nine's Today show from 2005 to 2019.</p>

<p>While she cut her hair short a while ago, her decision to change colour appears to be a fairly recent one.</p>

<p>Rosie started her career as a television producer, but is perhaps best known for hosting a variety of shows on Nine, 10, Foxtel and The Weather Channel.</p>

<p>However, she has largely stayed away from the spotlight since being made redundant from Ten Eyewitness News (now 10 News First) in 2014. </p>

<p>Their story: Steve and Rosie, who share custody of daughters Isabella and Francesca, married in 2010, three years after meeting on set of the Today show - where he was a star weather presenter and she was a behind-the-scenes producer. Pictured on December 5, 2015</p>
