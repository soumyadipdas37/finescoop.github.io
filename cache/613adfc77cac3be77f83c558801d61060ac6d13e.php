<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The governor of Virginia announced on Friday that he and his wife have both tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>

<p>The governor's office said in a statement that Ralph Northam is showing no symptoms, while those of Pam Northam are mild.</p>

<p>Northam and his wife plan to isolate for the next 10 days while working remotely.</p>

<p>Northam, a Democrat, is the only governor in the United States who is also a doctor. </p>

<p>Ralph Northam, the Democrat governor of Virginia, and his wife Pamela tested positive</p>

<p>Some Republican politicians have criticized his restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus, calling them too stringent.</p>

<p>Northam said in a statement that the positive test result shows that the virus is 'very real and very contagious.'</p>

<p>'We are grateful for your thoughts and support, but the best thing you can do for us — and most importantly, for your fellow Virginians — is to take this seriously,' Northam said.</p>

<p>The governor and first lady were notified Wednesday that a member of the Executive Mansion staff also had tested positive for the virus.</p>

<p>Three other governors also have tested positive for COVID-19, though one of those turned out to be a false positive.</p>

<p>Northam, a qualified doctor, confirmed his diagnosis on Friday morning</p>

<p>Northam is not showing any symptoms, and Pamela Northam is only suffering mild effects</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Missouri Governor Mike Parson, a Republican who has steadfastly refused to require residents to wear masks, announced he'd tested positive.</p>

<p>Kevin Stitt, governor of Oklahoma, in July became the first governor to announce he'd tested positive. He recovered and returned to work less than two weeks later.</p>

<p>In August, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that a rapid test was positive. But a short time later, DeWine said a more sensitive test was negative.</p>

<p>Northam's announcement that he tested positive for the virus comes on the same day as a planned rally by President Donald Trump in Newport News, an event the governor's staff has asked to be canceled, re-scheduled or scaled down because of concerns about the virus. </p>

<p>The event is expected to draw 4,000 people, which would violate Northam's executive order generally banning gatherings of more than 250 people. </p>

<p>The Trump campaign has routinely flouted public health guidelines intended to halt the spread of COVID-19.</p>
