<p>A post shared by  Naomi Campbell (<?php echo e('@'); ?>naomi) on Sep 19, 2020 at 5:42am PDT</p>

<p>The supermodel was romantically linked with the Grime artist in 2018, though they never publicly confirmed their relationship.</p>

<p>That same month, the runway icon rubbished suggestions she was no longer on speaking terms with Skepta.</p>

<p>After she made comments about an acrimonious break up with her last beau, fans were quick to claim she was talking about Skepta, which she disputed. </p>

<p>In an Instagram post, the Vogue cover star shared snaps of herself cosying up to the rapper, as she penned: 'STOP. All love between Us <?php echo e('@'); ?>skeptagram.'</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hearts: Back in June, the supermodel appeared to approve of the rapper treating himself to a face mask, as she wrote underneath it 'mask' with three love heart emojis </p>

<p>Speaking to Times Weekend magazine, Naomi said she is on good terms with all her previous ex-boyfriends, but admitted she isn't friends with her 'last' ex. </p>

<p>Discussing who she has dated, she said: 'Why don't you say it the other way round? Surely it was their privilege just as much as mine to be with them? But yes, I had some wild and exciting times until I changed my life aged 29.</p>

<p>'Whatever they say about me, I have remained friends with all my exes... except the last one.'</p>

<p>Asked if she means Skepta, she simply said: 'A lady never discusses the details of her private life.' </p>

<p>Latest romance? Skepta has since been linked with Adele. The rapper posted a flirty comment underneath her most recent post back in June</p>

<p>Romance? Fans speculated something romantic was brewing between the pair, when Skepta wrote, 'Finally got your Instagram password lol'</p>

<p>Naomi and Skepta were reportedly dating for around five months in 2018, with the rapper even referencing her in the song Interlude, claiming she wore sexy underwear for him during a video call.</p>

<p>He penned: 'How can I fall asleep when I’m on this FaceTime with Nao... shh. She got them ­Victoria Secrets that she’s tryna show me.'</p>

<p>In August 2018, Naomi unfollowed Skepta after he posted a baby scan on Instagram, leading fans to question whether or not they might be expecting.</p>

<p>She deleted any trace of him from her social media, including their raunchy GQ cover which had been released in March of that year.</p>

<p>Skepta has since been linked with Adele. The rapper posted a flirty comment underneath one of her Instagram posts back in June. </p>
