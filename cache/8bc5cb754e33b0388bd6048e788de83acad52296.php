<p>Tress-ed to impress: Ruth Langsford shared footage of herself looking completely different during a trip to the salon on Thursday, when she was seen sporting long hair extensions</p>

<p>She wrote: 'My hair extension tapes came out during lockdown and I hadn't bothered replacing them....but I missed the extra body they give my hair.</p>

<p>'I don’t have them for extra length, just to add a bit of volume at the sides. My hair definitely got thinner because of menopause so these really help.'</p>

<p>In a follow-up video, she was seen getting her hair prepared for colouring as she told fans she was 'getting the full works' done to her tresses.</p>
