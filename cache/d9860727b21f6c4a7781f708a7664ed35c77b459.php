<p>The host with the most: Earlier this week, the culinary artist revealed he's set to make his debut as a prime time game show host, as part of a new deal inked with the BBC</p>

<p>'It is such an intense game with so much jeopardy to win big and lose even bigger, where the difference between failure and success is always in the balance.</p>

<p>'I’m so happy to be working with the fantastic team at the BBC and cannot wait to get in the studio and start stacking those gold bars!'</p>

<p>A press release describes Bank Balance as 'a high-stakes, high-pressure, game show where contestants need both knowledge and nerves to succeed, where they can literally build themselves a fortune or see it come crashing down in an instant'.</p>

<p>Kate Phillips, Controller of Entertainment Commissioning at the BBS said in a statement: 'It’s fantastic to have Gordon on board hosting this new prime time game show. It promises to test nerve, accuracy and knowledge as well as entertain you.'</p>

<p>Production on the game show is scheduled to kick off later this year. </p>

<p>The father-of-five worked for free last year after deciding not to take any salary from his company's profits.</p>

<p>Gordon is the director of Gordon Ramsay Restaurants Ltd which includes eateries such as his three Michelin star Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.</p>

<p>A report filed to Companies House now shows that the chef didn't take any director's dividend from the profits which totalled £11.9million last year, reports The Sun. </p>

<p>The restaurateur has an estimated worth of £200million and this was the second year he didn't take any dividend. However his fellow director Andy Wenlock was paid a wage of £417,000.</p>

<p>He also put in £7.4million of his own money as a 'loan' according to the report and has given 'personal guarantees totalling £5 million in respect of the Group’s banking facility'. </p>
