<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Families across Australia could be forced to forego their annual Christmas photos with Santa Claus due to the coronavirus pandemic.   </p>

<p>Mel Cross, a Brisbane-based Santa impersonator who has been working in the industry for almost three decades, said he is normally fully booked up for the holiday period by October.</p>

<p>'This is just crazy, I've never had a situation where I haven't had Santa bookings,' he told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'I have so many regulars that I've done over the last 20 years, councils and stuff like that. They normally book the same time each year.'</p>

<p>Mel Cross, a Brisbane-based Santa impersonator who has been working in the industry for almost three decades, said he is normally fully booked up for the holiday period by October - but is without appointments due to coronavirus</p>

<p>At this stage, it remains unclear as to whether shopping centres will be allowed to put on their annual photo shoot with Santa.</p>

<p>The health crisis has also put a dampener on end of year work parties, carols and Christmas Day celebrations with each state and territory enforcing their own coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>Most of Australia has controlled community transmission of the virus and Victoria - who battled a deadly second wave of infections - has seen daily new case numbers plummet in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Social distancing remains part of every day life, with Australians encouraged to keep a distance of 1.5 metres. </p>

<p>'How do you social distance in Santa photos? Have four kids a metre a half away from each other?' Mr Cross asked. </p>

<p>'In Queensland, I can't see see any reason why Santa can't be with the kids.</p>

<p>At this stage, it remains unclear as to whether shopping centres will be allowed to put on their annual photo shoot with Santa. Pictured: A Santa Claus is seen with children at a Westfield shopping centre</p>

<p>'We wear gloves, we wear a beard you can't breathe through.</p>

<p>'We can't wear a mask, we'd look silly.' </p>

<p>Mr Cross said he normally does corporate work as Santa for the holiday period. </p>

<p>He is seeking an answer as to whether his annual work will be allowed to go ahead in the coming months - but is unsure who to ask.</p>

<p>'Is Santa going to unemployed this year as well?' </p>

<p>'Is Santa going to be different in every state and territory?' </p>

<p>Mr Cross said it would be tough on children across the country if they can't get a hug with Santa Claus - and it would also impact their grandparents. </p>

<p>'A lot of these kids take the photos to give to their grandparents,' he said. </p>

<p>'It's a tradition to get Santa photos every year, it shows the kids growing every year, it's like a running scrapbook.'</p>

<p>Scentre Group, who own Westfield shopping centres across the country, were also unable to confirm if Santa photos would go ahead this year</p>

<p>A Queensland Health spokesperson told the ABC it was too early to tell what would happen with over the holiday period.   </p>

<p>'As always, our advice is dependent on the presence of COVID-19 in the community and the source of its transmission,' they said.</p>

<p>Scentre Group, who own Westfield shopping centres across the country, were also unable to confirm if Santa photos would go ahead.   </p>

<p>'We will continue to follow health and government advice across all Westfield Living Centres, as we have done throughout the pandemic,' Scentre Group said in a statement.</p>

<p>'We will deliver a COVID-safe, festive and enjoyable experience for our customers this Christmas.'</p>
