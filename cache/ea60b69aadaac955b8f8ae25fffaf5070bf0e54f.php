<p>The mummy blogger discussed post-injury sex with an occupational therapist in preparation for her husband's home visit.  </p>

<p>'The OT asked me if I had any questions about intimacy post traumatic injury,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'I was like "actually we've already crossed that bridge, by drawing the curtains, not because we were looking for an exciting public place to f**k, but because the only time Denz has been aloud out of his carers sight is when I'm there".'</p>

<p>Constance didn't leave anything to the imagination and continued to reveal X-rated details.  </p>

<p>'He couldn't even shower alone so I knew he hadn't even been able to have a cheeky masti and obviously I missed his... Sorry that's probably a little...,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Constance also said the therapist advised the couple to keep Denim 'lying down' in the bedroom to protect his spinal injuries.  </p>

<p>'I have eaten nothing but Caramilk chocolate and golden KitKats for six weeks... ain't nobody safe underneath me,' she joked.  </p>

<p>'Somehow it's the thought of going on top that has just pushed me off the cliff of exhaustion.'</p>

<p>'Believe what you will, but every time I have updated publicly about Denz's condition the following day when I arrived to the hospital he had made a hugely significant improvement,' she said.</p>

<p>'I believe our combined energy has a lot to do with this weekend that I'm cherishing so much and the fact that Denzi will returns to me, even better than new.'   </p>
