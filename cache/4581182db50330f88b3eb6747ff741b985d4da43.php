<p>Happy: Lily Allen, 35, is set to 'move to New York to live with her husband David Harbour' after the singer has been quarantining in London following their wedding in Las Vegas</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted each of the representatives of Lily and David.   </p>

<p>Lily shares daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven with her ex-husband Sam Cooper, 42, and the couple finalised their divorce in 2018. </p>

<p>The Smile songstress revealed at the time how she has a 'very friendly' relationship with Sam, and that the pair have an unconventional custody agreement, where they take their daughters for alternative weeks at a time. </p>

<p>Couple: Lily and David, who were first romantically linked in 2019, surprised fans by revealing they had exchanged vows in a wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator (pictured in January 2020) </p>

<p>Speaking in 2018, she said: 'Me and my ex-husband share custody, a week on and a week off, which is useful for me work, when he's got them, I can do that.'  </p>

<p>Lily and David, who were first romantically linked in 2019, surprised fans by revealing they had exchanged vows in a wedding officiated by an Elvis Presley impersonator. </p>

<p>They divide their time between the UK and the US and sparked engagement rumours in May when Allen was seen with a sparkler on her ring finger in an Instagram post. </p>

<p>Sweet: Lily opted for a short white double-breasted dress with a bateau neckline, black buttons</p>

<p>On her wedding day, Lily opted for a short white double-breasted dress with a bateau neckline, black buttons, and a belted waist teamed with black suede platforms heels and a small bouquet of pink flowers. </p>

<p>She went onto share a snap with David outside the wedding chapel, before revealing they celebrated their marriage but grabbing fast food from In-N-Out. </p>

<p>However it appeared Lily headed back to the UK alone, as just a day earlier her new husband David was spotted out and about in New York City.</p>

<p>Lily posted a snap of her new office with the caption 'Quarantine Studio,' as she began her 14 days in isolation.  </p>

<p>Currently COVID-19 guidelines state that any UK resident returning from the United States must isolate for two weeks due to the country's high number of cases.    </p>

<p>Meanwhile Lily's new husband David was spotted out and about in NYC earlier this month, despite the COVID-19 regulations that require anyone returning from Nevada to New York to quarantine for 14 days.  </p>

<p>As of September 9, Nevada is listed as a restricted state on the New York government website, with the only exemption being someone who was passing through a restricted state and spent less than 24 hours there. </p>

<p>DailyMail.com contacted Harbour's representative for comment at the time.</p>
