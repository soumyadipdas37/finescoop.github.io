<p>Video footage taken by a family in Beeches Crescent, West Sussex, shows a man slowly trying to remove a pet tarantula from its tank.</p>

<p>Using a pencil, the man slowly nudges the arachnid onto his left arm.</p>

<p>A man from Beeches Crescent, West Sussex, gently nudges his son's pet tarantula onto his hand with a pencil before is runs off up his arm</p>

<p>Screams are heard from people watching as the spider crawls over the man's back and shoulders. he lies down on the ground as people scream</p>

<p>Sensing an opportunity for freedom though, the spider then attempts to dart away before crawling up the man's arm and onto his shoulders.</p>

<p>He is heard saying: 'You're going to have to help me out, someone.'</p>

<p>The tarantula then scuttles onto the man's neck while people in the background scream and laugh at the man's unfortunate situation.</p>

<p>A wooden skull is then used to try and encourage the spider off of the man's back but as soon as it enters the skull it then climbs through a hole and onto the man again - with all those standing around watching then screaming again.</p>

<p>As the man lies on the floor, a helper uses a wooden skull to try and pick the spider up. Unfortunately it falls through a hole and lands on the man again who asks for help from those stood watching</p>

<p>The video ends with the spider making its way down the man's back while he lies on the floor, still asking for help.</p>

<p>The person who filmed the video said: 'So we purchased a new tarantula for my six-year-old son. In the shop the spider was nice and calm, handled nicely.</p>

<p>'After settling down at home for a few days, my son asked me to get it out so we could show it to our friends, that's when it went wrong. </p>

<p>'It went straight up my husband's arm, onto his back and no one helped him, I just don't know what I would if done if it went down my jumper instead!!'</p>

<p>The video was originally filmed on April 2 but was recently shared online.</p>
