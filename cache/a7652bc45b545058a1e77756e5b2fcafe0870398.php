<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have laid out a strict set of demands for anyone wanting to book them as guest speakers - including an upfront fee agreement and details of all sponsors, a leaked document has revealed.</p>

<p>According to the 'Virtual Event Request Form', event organisers must let the Duke and Duchess dictate who introduces or moderates any discussion with them if they want to invite the couple to their event.</p>

<p>The four-page document comes from the Harry Walker Agency (HWA), a New York-based speaking agency, that has clients including former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton as well as Oprah Winfrey.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have laid out a strict set of demands for anyone wanting to book them as guest speakers, a leaked copy of their 'Virtual Event Request Form' has revealed</p>

<p>'The choice of introducer and moderator will be at the final discretion of the speaker,' reads the form, which was seen by the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'The fee will need to be paid directly from the contracting organisation's account,' it continues.</p>

<p>Stressing that details must be given of sponsors even if they are not directly involved with the speaker's presentation, the form asks: 'If you were to lose one or more of the above sponsors, would your organisation still be able to move forward with this event?'</p>

<p>And in case of a technological failure, event bookers must detail the 'connection format', whether using a video conferencing tool or satellite, and what contigency plans are in place if there are 'connectivity issues'. </p>

<p>Harry and Meghan have made several large moves in their quest for 'financial independence', and recently reimbursed taxpayers in full for the £2.4million used to renovate their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage</p>

<p>Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan, 39, could earn as much as £770,000 ($1million) for a speech through HWA, which calls its the 'World's #1 Exclusive Speakers' Agency'. </p>

<p>The Duke spoke at a J P Morgan event in Miami earlier this year where he received a reported six-figure sum.</p>

<p>Last week the couple signed a deal with Netflix, thought to be worth £112 million ($150m) for their new yet-to-be-named production company.</p>

<p>They even cancelled a key fundraising event for the Invictus Games after signing the deal. It was due to be shown on Amazon. The couple say that had nothing to do with it and it was cancelled by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Harry and Meghan have made several large moves in their quest for 'financial independence' after stepping down as senior members of the Royals Family in March.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan now live in a sprawling Montecito mansion, which sits on a seven-acre site, complete with pool, tennis court, guest quarters and stunning main house</p>

<p>In a move which has surprised royal sources, Harry and Meghan reimbursed taxpayers in full for the £2.4million used to renovate their Windsor home – in a dramatic escalation of their 'divorce' from the Royal Family.</p>

<p>The couple – who had been paying back the cash in monthly instalments – announced that they had totally refunded the Sovereign Grant for the redevelopment of five-bedroom Frogmore Cottage on the Queen's Berkshire estate.</p>

<p>The couple are 'relieved and pleased' to pay off renovation costs, a source has today claimed. </p>

<p>Sources close to the couple also claimed that they would no longer be receiving handouts from Prince Charles.</p>

<p>However, as they continue to find new jobs to support their high-flying lifestyle in Los Angeles, they have agreed not to engage in any commercial activities that could cause The Queen embarrassment.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted the couple's spokesperson for comment.  </p>
