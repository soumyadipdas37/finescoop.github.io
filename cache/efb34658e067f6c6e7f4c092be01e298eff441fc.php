<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia on Friday, the 47-year-old former Gogglebox star admitted she was shocked by Ciarran's bad behaviour on this year's season of Bachelor In Paradise.  </p>

<p>'I was a fan of Ciarran, but not now. Oh my God! Oh, what a complete turn around and massive letdown,' she said of the 26-year-old. </p>

<p>Former fan: She may have been a fan of Ciarran Stott when she met him on last year's season of The Bachelorette (pictured), but Angie Kent's best friend Yvie Jones has since changed her mind</p>

<p>'I could not believe what was coming out of his mouth and what he was saying about these women to the camera. I was like, "Do you not think this is going to be aired? Is this who you really are?" </p>

<p>'And it really must be, because he was really going for it. He was being really laddish, and I think that there's a lot of men that think that's okay.'</p>

<p>She confessed that Timm Hanly, who came runner-up behind Carlin Sterritt on The Bachelorette, didn't fare much better on the spin-off. </p>

<p>Yvie said that after witnessing the 27-year-old's behaviour in Paradise, she's relieved Angie didn't pick him during The Bachelorette finale, despite being a fan favourite.   </p>

<p>'Listening to Timm talk about ownership of women, I was like, "Thank God she didn't choose him,"' she revealed.</p>

<p>Yvie also said Angie, 30, knew there was something that wasn't quite right with Timm, even though she couldn't put her finger on it. </p>

<p>Playing the villains: She confessed that Timm Hanly, who came runner-up behind Carlin Sterritt on The Bachelorette, didn't fare much better on Bachelor In Paradise</p>

<p>'I think Angie really, really fell for Timm, obviously, to have come second. But as far as I understand, her gut was telling her something was off, even though he presented perfectly,' she explained.</p>

<p>'Her gut was saying, "Something's not right." That's as much as I understand it from her. She can't tell me exactly what it was, because he didn't do anything. </p>

<p>'She just said, "There's just something not right. I don't think this is going to translate into the real world how he was in there."'</p>

<p>After choosing Carlin, 31, in the finale, Angie confirmed her split with the F45 trainer last month, and Yvie said while she'd only met him once, he 'seemed lovely'.</p>

<p>'We didn't really become friends. He's in Sydney, and when they got out of the mansion, obviously it was all hush-hush, secret for three months, so they had that time together, and then I was in Melbourne by then,' she explained.</p>

<p>Yvie said the couple's breakup ultimately just came down to a lack of compatibility.</p>

<p>Imperfect match: Yvie said that while she'd only met Carlin Sterritt (left with Angie) once, he 'seemed lovely', and blamed their split on a lack of compatibility</p>

<p>'They were very happy together, it was just bad compatibility. I think compatibility has a lot to do with the real world,' she said. </p>

<p>'You can really love someone and be really into someone, but if their life is different to yours and their outlook is different and their morals are different, it's really hard to make it work for anyone.' </p>

<p>She added: 'If you want to be with someone in the long-term, you really do have to have a lot in common with them, or you're just going to grow apart.'  </p>
