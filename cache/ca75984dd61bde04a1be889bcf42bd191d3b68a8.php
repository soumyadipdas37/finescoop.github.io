<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A postman has been caught on a doorbell camera hurling a parcel of cosmetics 30 feet through the air because he couldn't be bothered to ring the bell.</p>

<p>Homeowner Damien Cooke got a Ring.com notification on his mobile that someone was approaching his house in Margate, Kent, on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>The estate agent, 49, said the postman didn't ring the bell and instead threw the package - which contained cosmetics for Mr Cooke's wife - towards the door.   </p>

<p>He compared the worker to former Brit Olympic shot putt star Geoff Capes and added: 'It was the best throw I've ever seen. It must have gone about 30ft.'</p>

<p>The postman didn't ring the doorbell for the house in Margate, Kent, and instead threw the parcel 30 feet into the air towards the front door</p>

<p>Homeowner Damien Cooke (pictured) got a Ring.com notification on his mobile</p>

<p>Mr Cooke was a bit frustrated the postman didn't ring so he could have let him through the gate at the end of the garden path.</p>

<p>He said Amazon and other delivery workers have done that or just carefully placed it over the gate. </p>

<p>Mr Cooke, owner of Cooke and Co Estate Agents, added: 'It had a few dents in it, but luckily nothing was broken.</p>

<p>'The slightly frustrating thing for me is it gives me a notification when someone is there.</p>

<p>'But he didn't even ring the intercom. He just threw it. He could have just placed it over the fence. I did email Royal Mail but I do not hold up much hope.</p>

<p>'I just want them to do that next time. And I don't want anyone to lose their jobs, particularly in this climate.'</p>

<p>He said although he found it funny, his wife was annoyed because it was her parcel. Luckily none of the products were damaged by the impact. </p>
