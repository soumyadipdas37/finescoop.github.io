<p>Trademark look: Transgender comedian Eddie Izzard put on a stylish display on Thursday at the opening of Art Hound Gallery's Icons exhibition</p>

<p>In July last year, Eddie asked to be called a ‘she’, despite previously refusing to be pinned down on gender, describing an identity that is ‘boyish and girlish’.</p>

<p>While receiving an honorary degree at Swansea University, she made the request.</p>

<p>The ceremony’s press release uses female pronouns to celebrate Izzard’s career, saying: ‘In 2009 she completed 43 marathons in 51 days…</p>

<p>'She has been a Labour party activist for most of her life… She twice attempted to be elected for a seat on Labour’s National Executive.’ A university spokesman said: ‘We were asked by Eddie to use her/she pronouns in the press release.’</p>

<p>An honour: Wearing trademark pink lipstick, the star, 58, wore a tight white top, a mini skirt and leather jacket while looking at the new works in the gallery alongside Rachel Tackley the Creative Director of Riverside Studios</p>

<p>Snapping away: In accordance with COVID-19 safety measures, Eddie and Rachel posed for socially distanced selfies and kept a gap between themselves in front of the art</p>

<p>Izzard identified as a transvestite on rising to prominence in the 80s, but more recently has preferred to use the term ‘transgender’.</p>

<p>Last night Izzard told The Mail on Sunday: ‘When I’m in girl mode I am happy to be known as “she” and when I’m in boy-mode, I am happy to be known as “he”. But I am equally happy to be referred to as Eddie or “Hey mate”.’ </p>

<p>The Icons exhibition is listed on The Art House Gallery's website as: 'From Hollywood legends, to Rock &amp; Roll superstars and theatrical celebs, icons have been an inspiration for a wave of artists exploring pop culture and beyond. </p>

<p>Open and honest: Izzard identified as a transvestite on rising to prominence in the 80s, but more recently has preferred to use the term ‘transgender’</p>
