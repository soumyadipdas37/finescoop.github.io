<p>Heidi teamed the stylish number with a pair of strappy stilettos, which were tied around her ankle and boosted her already statuesque frame.</p>

<p>She wore her blonde locks in a loose style in soft waves, and sported a glamorous coat of make-up including a bold red lip and heavy eye make-up look. </p>
