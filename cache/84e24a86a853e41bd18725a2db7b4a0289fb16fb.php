<p>In company: The Black Sabbath rocker, 71, cut a dapper figure in a smart grey coat, while he leaned on his cane for support amid his battle with Parkinson's disease</p>

<p>He announced in February that he was canceling the North American leg of his No More Tours II concert gigs, owing to an excruciating neck injury. </p>

<p>What's more, he suffered a fall last year and required spinal surgery, ultimately scrapping his tour dates for 2019. </p>

<p>Ozzy was meant to hit the road again this year, but scrapped the North American leg of his tour so that he could seek treatment in Switzerland - only for the coronavirus lockdowns to leave him confined to his home and unable to travel to Europe. </p>

<p>'You know the time when I will retire? When I can hear them nail a lid on my box. And then I'll f***ing do an encore. I'm the Prince of Darkness,' he said . </p>

<p>The Black Sabbath rocker admitted he has found it tough staying at home throughout the coronavirus pandemic, as he opened up about his mental health.  </p>

<p>Speaking on The Nine Lives of Ozzy Osbourne, he said: 'When I am in a room on my own, it is a bad f****** place. Our heads are our worst enemies in times like this because people are locked up and worried about this pandemic.'</p>

<p>They need to unload because if you do not unload, you'll get depressed. My therapist suggested that I start meditating again. I am on this new antidepressant which is working wonders.'  </p>

<p>As for his Parkinson's diagnosis, the rocker shared that he is making progress, explaining: 'I'm feeling better every day. It's so slow. I go in the swimming pool for an hour every day. I work out every day ... It catches up with you in the end'.</p>

<p>'I've got no complaints. I've had a great career. I had a great time. And I ain't done yet ... As soon as I get back on my feet I'll go out. I can't wait. Pandemic or not, I can't wait ... I will be happy as well. If my life ended on a stage, so be it. That's the place I belong.' </p>
