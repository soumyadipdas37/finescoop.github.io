<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Sydney bus route, a popular gym and a pub are the latest subjects of urgent public health warnings as a COVID-19 cluster in Sydney's CBD spreads.</p>

<p>Commuters who boarded the same Sydney bus as two confirmed COVID-19 cases have been told to immediately self-isolate.</p>

<p>Passengers on the X39 bus that left Pitt Street opposite Australia Square at 6.08pm on August 20 and arrived at Randwick's Clovelly Road at Carrington Road at 6.40pm are considered close contacts.</p>

<p>They all must isolate until midnight on September 3 and be tested for COVID-19 regardless of symptoms.</p>

<p>A previously reported case linked to Sydney's CBD cluster took the bus as did a second passenger who was confirmed as having the virus on Friday.</p>

<p>NSW Opposition Leader Jodi McKay has reiterated her call for Premier Gladys Berejiklian to mandate mask wearing for everyone on public transport.</p>

<p>'We now have an entire busload of passengers forced to self-isolate. Premier, please bite the bullet and make face masks mandatory on public transport. The dithering has gone on too long,' Ms Mckay tweeted on Monday.</p>

<p>With spring on the way, fears have been sparked that the beaches could be once again closed to the public like they were in March when the outbreak began. </p>

<p>Waverley Mayor Paula Masselos warned people to avoid the beach if it looks busy - or risk facing similar consequences from the first lockdown.</p>

<p>'We need to remember that we are still in a pandemic and we need to adapt our behaviour to that reality,' she posted on the council's Facebook page on Saturday.</p>

<p>If you are considering making the trip out to Bondi tomorrow, and the beaches look busy, please come back another time, or use that time to have lunch, grab a coffee or browse our local shops. Our local businesses really need that extra support and need people to continue to do the right thing so that we can keep our beaches open.'</p>
