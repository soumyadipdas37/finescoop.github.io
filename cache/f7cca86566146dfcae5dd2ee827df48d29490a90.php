<p>Cancelled: Brianne had been due to marry Kevin in a big wedding in Ireland, but the coronavirus pandemic had meant they had to cancel their plans</p>

<p>Due to Covid travelling restrictions, the couple were unable to have any guests with them from the UK, so their nuptials were attended only by Brianne's daughter Gracie, her immediate family, and two friends. </p>

<p>Yet the pair still had an incredible day, with Brianne gushing: 'It was amazing. Of course we had Gracie with us, but to also have our baby in my stomach took it to a complete other level. The baby kicked as we said "I do".' </p>

<p>The pair are now planning to have a lavish wedding ceremony in Ireland next year that can be attended by all their friends and family. </p>

<p>Previously speaking about her wedding plans, the blonde beauty told Hello! magazine: 'I have found The Dress, and our heart is set on getting married in Ireland, it will be so beautiful, and it is special to Kevin.'</p>

<p>Kevin’s late father was born in County Mayo in Ireland. </p>

<p>The couple added that they intended to have two maids of honour and two best men, with Brianne adding she hopes her daughter Gracie 'will be my flower-girl but she might just take over the whole day'. </p>

<p>Family fun: Due to Covid restrictions, the couple were unable to have any guests from the UK, so their nuptials were attended only by Brianne's daughter Gracie and her immediate family</p>

<p>Following their pregnancy news, however, the couple will have another child to fit into the wedding party when they tie the knot next year.  </p>

<p>This is the couple's first child together. Although they have yet to learn the sex of their baby, Brianne confirmed their baby is due in February. </p>

<p>The professional skater raises three-year-old daughter Gracie with an unnamed ex.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kevin has two daughters, 16-year-old Elsie and 14-year-old Isla, with his ex-wife Laura, who he split from in 2011 after 12 years of marriage. </p>

<p>Brianne and Kevin teased the news they wed earlier this month when they took to Instagram to post a photo of themselves clinking champagne glasses. </p>

<p>Brianne wrote: 'So, today was the day Kevin &amp; I were supposed to be getting married in Ireland 09-04-2020. Damn you Covid..., so we celebrated our way .......'. </p>

<p>The professional skater looked gorgeous in a lace floral bridal dress which featured a plunging neckline.  </p>

<p>Posing in front of a scenic sea backdrop,  Brianne's veil fluttered in the wind as footballer Kevin, who looked dapper in a tuxedo and bow tie, kissed her on the lips. </p>

<p>The retired Everton ace also shared the photograph on Instagram and wrote: 'We celebrated our proposed wedding day anyway.. I love you'.   </p>

<p>Sweet: This is the couple's first child together. Although they have yet to learn the sex of their baby, Brianne confirmed their baby is due in February</p>

<p>Brianne and Kevin first met in October when they were partnered on Dancing On Ice, and they have been in a relationship since December.</p>

<p>The couple then got engaged just two months later after being eliminated from the show, with Kevin popping the question at a steakhouse in London. </p>

<p>In their first TV interview as a couple, Kevin recalled how it was almost love at first sight when he was paired up with Brianne.</p>

<p>He said on Lorraine: 'When we first met four months ago, everything happened very quickly, it absolutely did. I certainly knew straight away that was it, yeah.</p>

<p>'I had huge reservations when I signed up for the show but then Brianne and I got together and it was great, I could have quit before the show started and I would have been happy. Everything's been great, everything's gone really well.'</p>

<p>Brianne, who quit Dancing On Ice last month, has hit the headlines with her past relationships, having previously romanced her DOI celebrity partners Matt Lapinskas and Sam Attwater as well as Danny Young, who was partnered with Frankie Poultney.  </p>

<p>Meant to be: Brianne and Kevin first met in October when they were partnered on Dancing On Ice, and they have been in a relationship since December</p>

<p>She previously insisted that Kevin isn't part of a pattern, as she gushed to OK magazine: 'There is no comparison of Kevin to the guys I used to date.</p>

<p>'He's perfect and my best friend. Kevin has all the boxes checked for what I'm looking for in my life.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kevin's relationship with his wife Laura came to an end in 2011 after 12 years of marriage.</p>

<p>The pair tied the knot when Kevin was just 22 and he blamed the split on the couple being 'naive' about settling down at such a young age. </p>

<p>The couple started dating shortly after the series finished and moved in together later that year. </p>

<p>The pair split within a few months and despite rekindling their romance in 2011, it wasn't meant to be, as Brianne then met her next boyfriend, Sam Attwater.  </p>
