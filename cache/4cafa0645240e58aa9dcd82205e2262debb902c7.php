<p>Mr Nolan told Daily Mail Australia the brand is often approach by alcohol companies.</p>

<p>'This is a natural thing because our brand represents good times,' Mr Nolan said. </p>

<p>'I think our prints have colour and energy and a sense of celebration about them that transports you.'  </p>

<p>Mr Nolan said that the pandemic had taken its toll on many ordinary Australians.  </p>

<p>'I think that it is going to be a summer where everyone needs a bit of uplifting, and I hope the bags can do that job,' he said.</p>

<p>'Times have been a little tough [in Australia due to COVID-19], so it's nice to add a bit of colour and cheer in whichever way we can.' </p>

<p>The single bottle bags are on sale for $3, while double bags are just 50 cents more. </p>

<p>'We received consumer feedback that our gifting bags were a little outdated and daggy and not worthy of gifting,' Anna Webster, Head of Wine Marketing at BWS, said.</p>

<p>'We brought in the Double Rainbouu duo to add their flair and we couldn't be happier with the result.  </p>

<p>Canadian pop star Justin Bieber (pictured) has been spotted rocking the brand's floral shirt during a Dubai trip in 2017</p>

<p>'Thanks to these new designs, buying a trendy bottle of craft gin or Pinot Noir as a last-minute gift at BWS, is equally matched with a trendy gift bag!' </p>

<p>Mr Nolan told Daily Mail Australia that the duo got the idea for their label during a trip to Bangkok.</p>

<p>'We were swimming in a sea of bad Hawaiian shirts and thought, nobody was doing them in a new fresh way,' he recalled.</p>

<p>'Sure there's always been a slight stigma about Hawaiian shirts and they definitely dip in and out of sartorial favour but they are also a bit of a cult classic and will never go away.'</p>

<p>The bags are available across the country for 12 months, or until stocks last. </p>

<p>The single bottle bags are on sale at BWS for $3, while double bags are just 50 cents more </p>
