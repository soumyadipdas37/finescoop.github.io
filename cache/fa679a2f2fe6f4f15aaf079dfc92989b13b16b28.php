<p>Pals: Weatherfield past crossed paths with Weatherfield present on Thursday as former Coronation Street co-stars Denise Welch and Jane Danson reunited in Cheshire</p>

<p>The panelist added to her look with a pair of chunky white fashion trainers, while a soft pink leather handbag rounded things off. </p>

<p>Joining Denise, close friend Jane, 41, wore a comparatively subdued white sleeveless top and blue denim jeans, teamed with conventional white running shoes. </p>

<p>The pair, who spent three years together on the cobbles between 1997 and 2000,  appeared delighted to be spending the afternoon together as they chatted over a table littered with coffee mugs and water glasses. </p>

<p>Delighted: The actresses greeted each other with a warm embrace before enjoying an al fresco coffee date at Wilmslow bar-restaurant Smoke</p>

<p>Denise's latest public appearance follows a turbulent few weeks for TV personalty, who quit social media on Friday following an escalating war of words with Piers Morgan. </p>

<p>The pair had repeatedly locked horns on Twitter following a difference of opinion regarding Britain's handling of the novel coronavirus pandemic - resulting in Piers branding her a 'dumb and dangerous Covid-denier.'  </p>

<p>Denise later tweeted about signing off online platforms to protect her mental health as she said: 'I’m going to be stepping back from here as it’s taking its toll. I will try and do my bit to balance the terror campaign and thank you for all your support.'</p>

<p>In good company: The pair were joined by Jane's husband Robert Beck during their appearance in Cheshire on Thursday </p>

<p>The TV regular also attempted to clarify comments made during a heated discussion on This Morning, where she claimed the government are scare-mongering.</p>

<p>She said: 'I seem to spend most of my days at the moment being quite emotional. I've been accused of not caring and being a Covid-denier when in fact I care so much about the devastation that Covid is causing, to the people who have lost their lives directly to Covid and those who are losing their lives because of Covid.</p>

<p>'All I have tried to do is find a balance between the five months of scaremongering, fear inducing, morning wakening anxiety that is causing illness mental and physical.'</p>

<p>'Thank you for your support': Actress Denise later tweeted about signing off online platforms to protect her mental health</p>

<p>Insisting she's shared 'balanced' reports about the virus on her accounts, Denise added: 'I have just tried to balance we all going to die, with we are not all going to die.</p>

<p>'If I find out that hospital had no Covid for weeks, I'd broadcast that, and when I found out that 52 people were on ventiators opposed to 2,800 people at the peak of this pandemic, I'd post that.</p>

<p>'If we did hit a second wave, people would know that things have come on massively in that time. We're not where we were in March. If people are hospitalised which God forbid could lead to more deaths, it's the fact that doctors have told me that they now prone the patients instead of putting them on ventilators.'</p>

<p>Lashing out:  Denise and Piers locked horns over a difference of opinion regarding Britain's handling of the coronavirus pandemic - resulting in him branding her 'dumb and dangerous'</p>

<p>The previous day Denise admitted it was 'the end of an era' after youngest Louis decided to move in with a friend, but added she'll still be seeing 'loads of him.' </p>

<p>Addressing the Loose Women panel, she said: 'He's leaving home today and he's 19, oh my god this is so embarrassing!</p>

<p>'We've been planning this for ages, he's moving in with his mate. I walked in and his stuff was piled by the door. It's the fact that it's the end of an era.</p>

<p>Emotional: Denise was also moved to tears on Loose Women as she revealed her youngest son Louis has left home</p>

<p>Close-knit: The actress admitted it's 'the end of an era' after Louis decided to move in with a friend, but added she'll still be seeing 'loads of him' (pictured with her elder son Matt in 2015)</p>

<p>'I know loads of people will be feeling this. It seems like two minutes ago he was clinging onto my leg. He's a fantastic kid and I will see loads of him.' </p>

<p>The presenter is also a parent to The 1975 singer Matty Healy, and she conceded the success of her elder son's band meant she saw him infrequently after he left the family home. </p>

<p>She added: 'When Matty and the boys were forming the band, he was at home till he was about 23. Then their career took off and it was like they were on another planet.'</p>
