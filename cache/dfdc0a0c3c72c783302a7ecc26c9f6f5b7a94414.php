<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Iran has sentenced three teenagers to have four fingers amputated each as a punishment for stealing. </p>

<p>Hadi Rostami, Mehdi Sharafian and Mehdi Shahivand, whose exact ages are not known, were handed the punishment on Thursday after a failed attempt to appeal. </p>

<p>They were originally tried on November 2 last year on four counts of robbery at a court in the city of Urmia, in northern Iran close to the border with Turkey.</p>

<p>The trio have been in jail since their trial, and are still being held as a date for the punishment to be carried out has not been set.  </p>

<p>Iran has sentenced three teenagers to have four fingers amputated from their right hands as a punishment for stealing in the city of Urmia (file image, a man has his hand placed into a machine that Iran uses to amputate fingers)</p>

<p>Iran has not released any details about the crimes. </p>

<p>Nargess Tavalossian, a legal analyst for Iran International TV, said: 'Amputation as a form of punishment is rare in Iran. </p>

<p>'To have this type of punishment there are 14 rules that all need to apply for the judge to order an amputation. </p>

<p>'Judges usually avoid issuing such punishment by saying that 13 out of the 14 rules are met and amputation is therefore not required.'</p>

<p>The rules include that the property has to be valued over a certain amount, that it has to be taken from a secure space, and that it cannot be government property or taken during a famine - otherwise the punishment does not apply. </p>

<p>Such punishment is also rare against teenagers, but the appeal court ruled that adolescents are not protected from the law.</p>

<p>Iran's penal code is based on a strict interpretation of Sharia law, which for first time thieves calls for 'amputation of the full length of four fingers of the right hand of the thief in such a manner that the thumb and palm of the hand remain.'</p>

<p>Second offenders face 'amputation of the left foot in such a manner that half of the sole and part of the place of anointing [during religious ceremonies] remain.'</p>

<p>The teenagers were handed the sentence on Thursday at a court in Urmia after their legal appeal failed when a judge ruled that juveniles are not exempt from the punishment </p>

<p>For third and fourth-time offenders, the law proscribes life imprisonment and the death penalty, respectively.</p>

<p>It is not clear how many people are subjected to amputation each year in Iran, since the regime keeps most cases secret to avoid international backlash.</p>

<p>Human rights watchdog Amnesty International confirmed at least two dozen amputations in the country between 2008 and 2015.</p>

<p>In a report on Iran's justice system, Amnesty International said: 'Amputation is torture plain and simple, and administering torture is a crime under international law. </p>

<p>'As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Iran is legally obliged to forbid torture in all circumstances and without exception. </p>

<p>'Those responsible for ordering and executing such practices should know that they are liable to criminal prosecution under international law.'</p>
