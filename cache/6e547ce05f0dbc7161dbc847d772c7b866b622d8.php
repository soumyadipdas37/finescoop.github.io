<p>The 26-year-old's actions have not gone unnoticed, and his national team boss has also praised his actions. </p>

<p>Speaking ahead of Sweden's Nations League ties, Janne Andersson told reporters: 'It is downright evil to rob 90-year-old ladies, but if that happens now, it is good that there are guys like Victor with civil courage, high morals and a lot of emotions,.</p>

<p>'Victor is a sensitive guy so when he sees this I understand that he reacts as he did. Fantastically well done.</p>

<p>'I have not talked to him, but I will pat him as much as you can in these times when we meet on Monday. More such civil courage in more people would be good for society.'</p>
