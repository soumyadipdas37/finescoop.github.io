<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Even though this has been the year when everything changed, it's September, the start of the new fashion season — we still have jobs to do, occasions when we want to dress to impress, and we still want to look in the loop.</p>

<p>That said we're not in the mood for fashion for fashion's sake. </p>

<p>In March, the autumn catwalks were awash with slinky, long dresses and wader-height boots, but we have zero use for clothes like these now. </p>

<p>The priorities of the average woman over 50 are simple: we want to look good for our age in clothes that work hard for us. </p>

<p>That's it. We're looking for key pieces that will age-proof our wardrobes into next spring and beyond. Here's my list...</p>

<p>BIG PUFFED SLEEVES </p>

<p>Green top, £29.99, hm.com; red top, £14; jeans £16, george.com</p>

<p>Still going strong and gathering volume, though just a hint of balloon will do the job, too. </p>

<p>This is the detail that makes shirts and dresses and sweaters look thoroughly up to date, and it's easily the simplest and prettiest trend to buy into. </p>

<p>Everyone's looking at your sleeves this autumn. What's more, you can wear a really bold sleeve with zero fear of looking embarrassing. Almost.</p>

<p>This red top is £14 from george.com, and the jeans are £16. You can wear a really bold sleeve with zero fear of looking embarrassing</p>

<p>VELVET TAILORING </p>

<p>Blazer, £234, Bella Freud at matchesfashion.com </p>

<p>You really can't go wrong with a velvet jacket to spruce things up — and this autumn they come in all shapes and sizes, with trousers to match, or mismatched long skirts if you prefer. </p>

<p>The way to make velvet look fresh is to wear a jacket in the day with a neck-tie top and wool trousers. A velvet tux is still a safe bet for evening. </p>

<p>DARK ALL OVER PRINT DRESS   </p>

<p>Dress, £295; shoes, £195, meandem.com</p>

<p>With a neck tie and long sleeves, flowing and asymmetric and unashamedly busy, this won't be for everyone, but talk about a one-step problem-solver! </p>

<p>All you need are boots, a midheel sandal or trainers and you're good to go.</p>

<p>With a neck tie and long sleeves, flowing and asymmetric and unashamedly busy, this won't be for everyone, but talk about a one-step problem-solver! The dress is £295 and the shoes £195 from meandem.com</p>

<p>CHUNKY CHAINS </p>

<p>Belt, £84, thekooples.com; Bag, £29.99, zara.com </p>

<p>Chunky chains on shoes, on belts, around your neck, as the clasp on an edge-to-edge jacket are the big standout detail of the season. </p>

<p>And keep your eyes peeled for a trophy belt: they come with big buckles or chunky chain clasps and instantly make everything, from a long-sleeved midi-dress to boot-cut jeans, look more glamorous and edgy. </p>

<p>Chunky chains are the big standout detail of the season. They can go on shoes, on belts, around your neck or as the clasp on an edge-to-edge jacket. Pictured: This belt is £84 from thekooples.com</p>

<p>Pictured: This attractive blue bag, which comes with its own chunky chain, is £29.99 from Zara.com</p>

<p>BROWN COATS AND HIGHER, WIDER TROUSERS </p>

<p>Coat, £69; top, £19.50; trousers, £19.50, marksandspencer.com</p>

<p>Brown (anywhere on the spectrum from pale caramel to chocolate) is the coat colour of the season. </p>

<p>And it's worth considering, because you'll never not get wear out of a well-tailored caramel coat; it's got all the advantages of classic camel without being old-school smart, and it's less severe than black.</p>

<p>Styles that will work hardest for us include a double-breasted masculine tailored cut, a belted teddy bear style or a buttonless wrap. </p>

<p>Black, too, is certainly back for autumn, but sometimes (at night) brown is more forgiving, warmer, and we want a coat that we can wear any time, any place.</p>

<p>Brown (anywhere on the spectrum from pale caramel to chocolate) is the coat colour of the season. Pictured: The above coat is £69; the top, £19.50 and the trousers £19.50, all from marksandspencer.com</p>

<p>Alternatively, go for a belted grey plaid design.</p>

<p>As for trousers, it really is time to let go of the leg-clinging look.</p>

<p>Wear jeans and trousers higher-waisted and looser-legged, with a tucked-in shirt or baggy with a pleat front and cinched with a belt if that suits you.</p>

<p>These trousers are so much more elegant, and once you get used to the loose-tailored style, you'll be amazed that we ever wore anything else.</p>

<p>Note: a mid-heeled ankle boot will give you the extra height to pull them off, if in doubt. </p>

<p>BLANKET SCARVES AND GIANT STOLES </p>

<p>Poncho, £149, winserlondon.com </p>

<p>Is this just the return of the pashmina? Not really. </p>

<p>It serves a similar function, it's still all about comfort and adding something extra, but it's less girly and more swaggery. </p>

<p>The beauty of big wraps is that you can sling them over a blazer or a polo-neck, wrap them around an insubstantial dress, drape them over head-to-toe black to give you a boost of colour and pattern (how about in the season's plaid?) or dangle them over the shoulder of a caramel coat for extra dash.</p>

<p>Blanket scarves and giant stoles serve a similar purpose to the pashmina - it's still all about comfort and adding something extra. Pictured: This poncho is £149 from winserlondon.com</p>

<p>If you love ponchos and capes but can't justify getting either, then the giant scarf/fashion blanket is a great compromise.</p>

<p>Wrap it, drape it, sling it around ... it's a cover-up and a fashion boost in one. </p>

<p>HIGH NECK OR TIE NECK </p>

<p>Blouse, £80, kitri-studio.com </p>

<p>Useful and midlife-friendly, so long as you're careful not to pick anything too frilly, the high-necked blouse or dress is both the perfect neck disguiser and the most fashionable choice.</p>

<p>A shirt with a hint of a pie crust collar or neck tie was the number one pick on the catwalk to go with suits or under bomber jackets.</p>

<p>The high-necked blouse or dress is both the perfect neck disguiser and the most fashionable choice. Pictured: The above high-necked piece is £80 from kitri-studio.com</p>

<p>The alternative is a neck scarf. If this is your preference, then go for one that's attached to a shirt or sweater (as at Saint Laurent) or in a coordinating colour. </p>

<p>Keep it slim and slinky, and steer clear of pussy bows, which can turn frumpy. </p>

<p>COLOUR BLOCK CLASH  </p>

<p>Jumper, £69, skirt, £45, boots, £149, johnlewis.com</p>

<p>This season, we're not so much thinking about evening or party — that's not a big priority for obvious reasons — and all the clothes we're interested in can be dialled up for night time or crisped up for work.</p>

<p>The colour block clash is one trend on the catwalk which is pretty irresistible. Pictured: The above jumper is £69, the skirt £45 and the boots £149, all from johnlewis.com</p>

<p>That said, there was one trend on the catwalks (see Saint Laurent) that's pretty irresistible (in addition to velvet tailoring): the colour block clash. </p>

<p>Knowing we can lift our spirits with this come the cold weather, is reassuring.</p>

<p>GO ANYWHERE BOOTS AND FLATS </p>

<p>Pumps, £169, prettyballerinas.com; boots, £169, massimodutti.com </p>

<p>There's no doubt that, for now, high heels have been tossed to the back of the wardrobe and flats are having a moment.</p>

<p>If loafers and brogues are not your style (and who can blame you?), ballet pumps and pointy flats are also back, as are chunky-soled Chelsea boots and cowboy-style ankle boots.</p>

<p>Chunky-soled Chelsea boots and cowboy-style ankle boots are back. Pictured: This pair are £169 from massimodutti.com</p>

<p>Pointy flats are also back, while high heels have been tossed to the back of the wardrobe. Pictured: These pumps are £169 from prettyballerinas.com</p>

<p>Boots are everywhere for autumn, frequently over the knee, often platform, sometimes with all-terrain tractor soles, but the rule is sturdy, not spindly. </p>

<p>The idea, of course, is to find the design that works with the most outfits and kicks your wardrobe into the right spot. </p>

<p>Look for an almond toe, a solid heel, a looseish fit — and make sure they're black.  </p>

<p>TAILORED SUITS </p>

<p>Blazer, £110; top, £195; trousers, £55; shoes, £120, reiss.com</p>

<p>We've always said, if you want to make life easy and look pulled together, the answer is tailoring.</p>

<p>And, better still, a suit.</p>

<p>If you want to make life easy and look pulled together, the answer is tailoring. The suit has rocketed back to fashion this winter. Pictured: This blazer is £110; the top £195; the trousers £55 and the shoes £120, all from reiss.com Blazer, £110; top, £195; trousers, £55; shoes, £120, reiss.com </p>

<p>This winter, the suit has rocketed back to first position — but it's not quite the one you may have hanging in your wardrobe. </p>

<p>This one is masculine and slightly slouchy, all the better to wear to the office and out after (with the sleeves pushed up and perhaps a change of top).</p>

<p>Jackets are long-line with strong shoulders, and trousers are high-waisted and loose in the leg. </p>

<p>Go for dark navy or grey rather than black, and wear with a polo-neck or crisp blue boyish shirt with the cuffs on show, and loafers with or without heels. </p>

<p>If you want to combine two trends, try a suit in a tweedy check or houndstooth.</p>

<p>SKIRT SUITS </p>

<p>Jacket, £130; skirt, £78, lkbennett.com </p>

<p>Yes, they really are back.</p>

<p>If you were wearing them for work in the 1980s, then fear not, this one is not nippy with a short skirt: the skirt is A-line or narrow, below the knee or longer; the jacket is cinched with wide lapels.</p>

<p>For decades, wearing a matching jacket and skirt has been not at all tempting — too much like an airline uniform — but now, thanks to Dior and our instinct for keeping things simple and elegant, the skirt suit looks interesting again.</p>

<p>Yes, skirt suits really are back. For decades, wearing a matching jacket and skirt has been not at all tempting — too much like an airline uniform — but now, thanks to Dior and our instinct for keeping things simple and elegant, the skirt suit looks interesting again. Pictured: The above jacket is £130 and the matching skirt is £78 from lkbennett. com</p>

<p>You can always just wear the skirt with a sweater and sharp shirt (very Victoria Beckham) or a high-necked blouse and a cropped jacket. </p>

<p>It doesn’t have to match, just team up. And if you’re more comfortable hands shrugged in pockets, then a jacket and a pair of those culottes (seen at Celine) is the answer.</p>

<p>You might want one in a light grey plaid or Prince of Wales check. </p>

<p>Normally, we’d bypass plaid, but this autumn, plaid and houndstooth and tweedy checks look more grown-up and appealing than they have for years.</p>
