<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A North Queensland fisherman has captured the bizarre moment an enormous saltwater crocodile swam through a waterway like a dolphin.</p>

<p>Alec Dunn filmed the four-and-a-half-metre crocodile porpoising in the water while alongside his tinny on the Bloomfield River on Monday.</p>

<p>The crocodile, known as 'Tommy' created a huge wake off its back as it glided downstream.</p>

<p>Mr Dunn said Tommy was swimming underneath his boat before he emerged and followed him through the shallow water.</p>

<p>Alec Dunn filmed a crocodile swimming like a dolphin (pictured) on the Bloomfield River in North Queensland</p>

<p>'He came up with this growl and locked eyes with me. I was only in a 3.5metre tinny and he cruised right next to me. It was interesting,' he told Cairns Post.</p>

<p>'He was gaffing it for that deep water. He was sizing me up and I thought he was going to go for the tinny, but lucky he didn’t.'</p>

<p>Mr Dunn said Tommy is one of several large crocodiles in the region known to local fisherman and not the biggest of the group. </p>

<p>His footage of the crocodile went viral, with many commentators wondering why Tommy was traversing like a dolphin.</p>

<p> Mr Dunn (pictured) said the 4.5metre beast swam underneath his tinny and growled at him before he started filming</p>

<p>Mr Dunn believes he was simply bounding off the bottom of the river in the shallow water and coming up to breath. </p>

<p>Daintree River crocodile guide David White said Tommy's behaviour was unusual and highly dangerous. </p>

<p>'That's an angry dive down, not one we usually see when they are just hiding,' he said.</p>

<p>'That's a pi**ed off croc.'</p>

<p>Experts claimed the crocodile's porpoising swimming style was unusual and very dangerous</p>
