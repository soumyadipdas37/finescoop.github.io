<p>The 28 days of zero community virus transmission in NSW was reset last Friday despite NSW health officials believing they had linked the case to a known outbreak. </p>

<p>Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the case, that was linked to the Liverpool Hospital cluster, would still be treated as a mystery case.</p>

<p>This means NSW is now seven days into the new 28 day cycle of no new community transmission before the border can open. </p>

<p>'The nationally agreed-to discussion was that it needed to be linked within 48 hours and we are beyond that time frame now,' Dr Young said.</p>

<p>'So it is about easily linking a case.' </p>
