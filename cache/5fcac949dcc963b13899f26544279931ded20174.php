<p>COVID-19 concerns: The new legal drama series, For Life, which Curtis '50 Cent' Jackson serves as executive producer and guest star, shut down filming in New York on Friday due to issues with COVID-19 testing on set</p>

<p>So far it's unclear how many positive results or false positives there were among the cast and crew, but the inconsistency was still enough to have studio executives shut production down temporarily. </p>

<p>For Life had been shooting in the borough of Queens, although 50 Cent was not seen on set at the time, as reported by TMZ. </p>

<p>The series, which started filming its second season on August 26, is believed to be the first production to be back up and running in New York since the mass closures due to the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>It's believed that multiple people on the show produced positive tests followed by negative results, according to sources</p>

<p>The premise: The series, which started filming its second season on August 26, stars Nicholas Pinnock as a man imprisoned for a crime that he did not commit who becomes an attorney and helps to overturn the wrongful convictions of twenty of his fellow inmates, including himself</p>

<p>Film and television productions across the country are now slowly returning with an abundance of precautions and coronavirus testing in place.  </p>

<p>For Life is scheduled to resume production in Queen on Monday as scheduled, if there's a remedy for the testing problems.  </p>

<p>The drama, which stars Nicholas Pinnock in the lead role, is loosely based on the life of Isaac Wright Jr., who was imprisoned for a crime that he did not commit. While incarcerated, he became an attorney and helped to overturn the wrongful convictions of twenty of his fellow inmates, before finally proving his own innocence.  </p>

<p>Along with Pinnock the show also features Indira Varma, Joy Bryant, Dorian Missick, Tyla Harris, Mary Stuart Masterson, Boris McGiver and Timothy Busfield, among others.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to start handing out bundles of cash which garnered an abundance of excitement. </p>
