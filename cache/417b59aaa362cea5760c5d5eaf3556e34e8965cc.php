<p>Bow down, peasants! On Tuesday, Kate Miller-Heidke (pictured) revealed what she found to be the most difficult thing about being the Queen on The Masked Singer... and it wasn't keeping her identity a secret </p>

<p>'Ernie is only 4 and he didn't really understand why I couldn't come downstairs, though he tried,' the mother-of-one revealed.</p>

<p>'He would come below my window and yell 'Rapunzel!' whenever he wanted to have a chat, and sometimes we ate together with him at a little table on the ground.'</p>

<p>Production on The Masked Singer was forced to temporarily suspend after dancers and crew tested positive for coronavirus last month.</p>

<p>Tough times! Kate explained the most challenging part of gig was having to self-isolate for 14 days and not being able to communicate with her son</p>

<p>Kate, host Osher Günsberg and judges Dannii Minogue and Jackie 'O' Henderson, and 200 workers were all ordered into self-isolation.</p>

<p>'I'm lucky I had somewhere to isolate at home, and that I didn't get the virus.</p>

<p>'I was so relieved that all 17 cases had completely recovered by the time we filmed the finale two weeks later. What a time!' she concluded.</p>

<p>So cute! 'He would come below my window and yell "Rapunzel!" whenever he wanted to have a chat, and sometimes we ate together with him at a little table on the ground</p>

<p>'I tend towards Hypochondria at the best of times, so was on constant alert for symptoms to appear,' she said.</p>

<p>The singer added that she would also regularly test her sense of smell with things in the bathroom or the fruit bowl and admits she couldn't sleep very well.</p>

<p>Kate placed runner-up to former Neighbours star Bonnie Anderson, who won the Channel 10 singing competition as Bushranger.</p>
