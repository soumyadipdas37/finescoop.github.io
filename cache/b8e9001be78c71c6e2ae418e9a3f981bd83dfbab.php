<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anita Hill has vowed to vote for Joe Biden in the November election, despite the 'mistakes' he made while overseeing the confirmation hearing where she testified against then-Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas. </p>

<p>'Notwithstanding all of his limitations in the past, and the mistakes that he made in the past, notwithstanding those -- at this point, between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, I think Joe Biden is the person who should be elected in November,' Hill told CNN in an interview. </p>

<p>'Its more about the survivors of gender violence. That's really what it's about.' </p>

<p>Hill added that her 'commitment is to finding solutions, and I am more than willing to work with him.'</p>

<p>Anita Hill told CNN that she will vote for Joe Biden (right) in the upcoming November election </p>

<p>In 1991, HiIl sat before an panel of all-male senators and alleged that Clarence sexually harassed her while they worked together at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.    </p>

<p>Biden served as Senate Judiciary Committee chairman and oversaw the confirmation hearing and testimony,  </p>

<p>She claimed that Thomas made inappropriate sexual remarks, including mentions of pornographic movies, and described his genitals on an occasion.</p>

<p>Her testimony was met with an aggressive, abrasive line of questioning from the senators that were sexist and called into question her personal credibility. </p>

<p>In one instance, former GOP Sen. Howell Heflin had asked Hill if she was a 'scorned woman' or a 'zealot civil rights.'</p>

<p>'Now, in trying to determine whether you are telling falsehoods or not, I have got to determine what your motivation might be. Are you a scorned woman?' he had asked.       </p>

<p>The confirmation hearings gripped the nation and sparked a media-frenzy, but they had an adverse affect on Hill's aspirations to work atop Capitol Hill.</p>

<p>'One of the impacts of 1991 was my desire not to really work with the government in any way,' Hill told CNN.</p>

<p>'I always said, I think I can be more effective as an outsider, as opposed to an insider. And now, I'm willing to evolve myself, to work for change inside.'</p>

<p>Led by Biden, an all-male panel of Republican senators launched a brutal line of questioning against Hill (pictured) </p>

<p>Hill, who is currently a professor at Brandeis University, even hopes to work with him on issues of gender violence, sexual harassment and gender discrimination. </p>

<p>'What drives me is the people who have experienced [those issues] and the people who will be experiencing them, if we don't do something about it,' she said,</p>

<p>'That is what has opened me up to do something that I probably would not have said I would do a year ago.'   </p>

<p>Biden previously defended his handling of the committee hearing and pushed back against accusations he did not taken Hill's testimony seriously.</p>

<p>'I believed her story from the very beginning,' Biden told CNN in an July interview. 'I wish I could have protected her more. ... I did get in shouting matches, as you'll remember, with some of the witnesses who were saying things that were off the wall.'</p>

<p>Hill has maintained  that Biden lost control of the hearing, allowing his colleagues to devolve into humiliating questions.  </p>

<p>Biden argued that he did not allow the majority conservative panel to overtake the hearing.</p>

<p>'I don't think I did. I wish I could have done it differently under the rules,' Biden said. </p>

<p>'But when it ended, I was determined to do two things. One, make sure never again would there not be women on the committee. ... And I was determined to continue and finish writing and passing the Violence Against Women Act.'</p>

<p>Biden has since apologized to and the two spoke via phone call shortly before Biden began his presidential campaign in April 2019.</p>

<p>Clarence Thomas (pictured) eventually won the vote and became a Supreme Court Justice </p>

<p>At the time, Hill called their discussion 'unsatisfying' and said Biden hadn't truly taken responsibility for his actions.</p>

<p>'An apology, to be real and sincere, has to take responsibility for harm,' Hill told CNN.</p>

<p>'He didn't take responsibility. He didn't hold himself accountable in any way, except that he was sorry that I felt I wasn't treated fairly. He didn't take ownership of his own role as chair of the committee.'</p>

<p>That same month, Biden publicly shouldered the blame during an interview with ABC.</p>

<p>'As the committee chairman, I take responsibility that she did not get treated well. I take responsibility for that,' he said. </p>

<p>The acknowledgment, according to Hill, showed a level of growth and personal development.</p>

<p>'There was a statement about 'I take accountability; I hold myself responsible for the way the hearing was run,' she said.</p>

<p>'And so that, I think, is as close as we've gotten, you know, and that's good. That's an opening.' </p>

<p>Hill: ''I believe that Joe Biden would be that person. I do not believe that Donald Trump would be the person who would hear me...'</p>

<p>And that accountability and push for open dialogue is something she sees in Biden, not Trump.</p>

<p>'I want the next president to be somebody that I can go to and talk about the real issues that women, men, and non-binary people are experiencing with violence in this country, that's directed to them because of their gender,' said Hill.</p>

<p>'I believe that Joe Biden would be that person. I do not believe that Donald Trump would be the person who would hear me...'</p>
