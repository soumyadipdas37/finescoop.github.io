<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Caroline Flack gave Lewis Burton £25k to help pay off his debts just like his new love interest Lottie Tomlinson, it has been claimed.</p>

<p>The late TV presenter, 40, who died in February, allegedly handed the model the cash during their relationship and also paid for rent and food, reports The Sun On Sunday.</p>

<p>It comes after MailOnline exclusively revealed that Lottie's brother Louis was worried about how she had given Lewis, 28, a lump sum of £22K in August. </p>

<p>Claims: Caroline Flack is said to have given Lewis Burton £25k to help pay off his debts while they were dating, according to a source (pictured together)</p>

<p>A friend of Caroline's told the paper: 'When Lewis was with Caroline she gave him about £25,000 to pay off his debts.  </p>

<p>'It stinks. He's going on flash holidays to Marbella and Ibiza, living the high life and women are paying for it. </p>

<p>'Caroline would be heartbroken if she could see him now and see that Lottie is handing over tens of thousands of pounds in exactly the same way.'  </p>

<p>The source also claimed that while Caroline and Lewis were together, the presenter paid for their rent as well as clothes, food, and holidays. </p>

<p>New couple? It comes after MailOnline revealed Lottie Tomlinson's family were 'worried' about her giving Lewis £22K towards paying off his debts (pictured together in Ibiza in August)</p>

<p>And although acknowledging a man doesn't have to pay for everything, the source highlighted that they were 'talking large sums of money'.</p>

<p>Lewis representative told The Sun on Sunday that he denied Caroline had given him money. MailOnline has also contacted his spokesperson for a comment.</p>

<p>Model Lottie's family have also expressed how they're growing 'worried' about the blonde beauty after she gave Lewis a large sum of cash and footed the bill during expensive restaurant visits. </p>

<p>A source said: 'Lottie paid off a debt for Lewis to the value of £22K in August, a month after they confirmed their relationship.</p>

<p>'Louis has since found out, as well as Lottie's grandparents who are worried.</p>

<p>Protective: Louis Tomlinson was recently said to be 'concerned' about his sister's new romance after finding out Lottie gave Lewis Burton £22k to pay off his debts (pictured in October 2016)</p>

<p>'Lottie's twin sisters Phoebe and Daisy told their grandparents it was Lottie who paid the bill when they ate together with Lewis at London restaurant The Ivy, which caused them to worry further.'   </p>

<p>It is understood that Louis has been in Los Angeles where his four-year-old son, Freddie, lives, throughout lockdown while Lottie resides in London. </p>

<p>MailOnline revealed Caroline's ex-boyfriend was dating Lottie in July and the pair later confirmed their relationship by holidaying together in Ibiza. </p>

<p>They have since been pictured passionately kissing, as well as sharing an animated exchange, which looked like an argument. </p>

<p>Lewis started dating Lottie five months after Love Island host Caroline tragically took her own life aged 40 in February. </p>

<p>Career driven: While Louis is said to have a net worth of £45million, Lottie has found her own success with her beauty brand Tanologist and by working as an influencer </p>

<p>TV presenter Caroline was charged with common assault following an alleged attack on Lewis, which took place at her London home last December. </p>

<p>In March last year, siblings Louis and Lottie lost their 18-year-old sister, Félicité, after she died from an accidental overdose.</p>

<p>Their mother Johannah also passed in 2016 from leukaemia at 43, with Lottie thanking her fans in July for being her 'extended family' and 'support mechanism.'</p>

<p>According to sources, Lottie and Lewis first connected over their grief, after the former model spoke on Instagram in March of being 'lost for words' and 'in so much pain' following Caroline's sudden death.</p>

<p>Devastating: Former Love Island presenter Caroline Flack was in a relationship with Lewis before she tragically took her own life in February (pictured in October 2019)</p>

<p>Since the end of lockdown Lewis has been on several holidays, including to Marbella twice with friends and a trip to Ibiza, which he enjoyed with girlfriend Lottie. </p>

<p>Louis is said to have a net worth of £45million, which is mostly owed to his time in One Direction, as well as his role as a judge on The X Factor.</p>

<p>Lottie has found her own success with the creation of her beauty brand Tanologist, as well as doing collaborations with lingerie company Boux Avenue and online retailer ASOS. </p>

<p>It was reported last month that Lottie had also been lined up to appear in this year's series of I'm A Celeb, and had met on Zoom with ITV producers.</p>
