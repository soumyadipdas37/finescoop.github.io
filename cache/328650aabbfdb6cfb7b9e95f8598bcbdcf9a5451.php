<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A convicted killer who raped a South Australian prison guard while in jail has had five- and-a-half years added to his sentence.</p>

<p>James Hall was almost 12 years into a 22-year-minimum non-parole period for a murder in 2006 when the latest offending occurred in 2017.</p>

<p>Imposing sentence in the District Court on Thursday, Judge Gordon Barrett said the guard had gone into Hall's cell to speak about a prison-related matter.</p>

<p>James Hall was almost 12 years into a 22-year-minimum non-parole period for a murder in 2006 when the latest offending occurred in 2017</p>

<p>Hall closed the door behind her and after some conversation, it was then that he committed the two acts of rape.</p>

<p>'She froze and complied with your demands because she feared the more that she fought, the more you would fight,' Judge Barrett told the 33-year-old.</p>

<p>'She knew something of the circumstances of the offending which saw you in prison.'</p>

<p>Judge Barrett said the woman suffered only minor physical injuries, but had endured significant mental anguish.</p>

<p>'She is filled with self-blame for trusting you and for putting herself in a position of being vulnerable,' he said.</p>

<p>In his earlier verdict after a trial by judge alone, Judge Barrett said he found Hall's account of the incident to be 'entirely false' but described the victim's evidence as 'detailed, nuanced, consistent, credible and truthful'.</p>

<p>In her victim impact statement the guard said having to relive the incident during the trial had 'almost broken me' and going to work was now 'overwhelming'.</p>

<p>'I don't feel safe to walk among prisoners anymore,' she said.</p>

<p>Judge Barrett said it was likely Hall would spend the rest of his jail sentence in a high-security facility after offending against a woman who was just carrying out her job in prison.</p>

<p>He imposed a head sentence of seven-and-a-half years for the two rapes and added five-and-a-half years to Hall's existing non-parole period, taking it to 27-and-a-half years.</p>
