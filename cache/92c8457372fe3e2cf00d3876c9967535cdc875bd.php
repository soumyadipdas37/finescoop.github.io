<p>Congratulations! Harry and Dean became engaged in August last year, with Amy throwing them a lavish celebratory bash</p>

<p>On last Sunday's episode of TOWIE, Harry's ex-boyfriend Bobby Norris and Amy addressed their six-year feud which began when the make-up artist cheated on Bobby during their romance in 2014, and Amy decided to stand by her cousin.</p>

<p>The duo confronted each other over their long-running row on the reality show, and decided to lay their spat to rest after TOWIE original, Amy, made her return to the show.</p>

<p>Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'.  </p>

<p>Speaking to Fubar host Stephen Leng about their dispute, Bobby said: 'There's kind of no ill feeling my side. It's great to have her back on the show.</p>

<p>He continued: 'I'm one of them people babe, I don't harbour grudges with anyone and it was never really our problem. </p>

<p>'I would never hold it against her what happened between me and her cousin and vice versa.'</p>

<p>Cheers to moving on: Bobby Norris has revealed there is no bad blood between himself and Amy after they addressed their six-year feud on last Sunday's episode of TOWIE</p>
