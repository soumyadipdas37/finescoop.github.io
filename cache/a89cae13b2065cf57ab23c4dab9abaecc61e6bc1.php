<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lionel Messi is facing the prospect of a £1.1m fine and a suspension after missing the start of Barcelona's pre-season preparations.</p>

<p>Messi, who is eager to secure a move away, didn't report for coronavirus testing on Sunday and wasn't present as training started on Monday.</p>

<p>According to Marca, Barcelona are set to punish Messi, with the 33-year-old poised to incur 'serious penalties' as a result of his actions. </p>

<p>Lionel Messi could face a fine of £1.1million after missing the start of Barcelona's pre-season</p>

<p>Messi, who earns £95m a year, believes that he is no longer an employee of Barcelona but if he is absent for a third day he could have his salary withdrawn for 11 days or receive a fine of 25 per cent of his monthly salary. He earns £1.1m per month. </p>

<p>Messi’s fixed yearly salary totals £64m (€71m) but bonuses for signing, for staying, and for winning trophies takes the figure well above that.</p>

<p>Just by playing 60 per cent of games until the 2021 date when his contract ends sees Messi earn on average £95m (€106m) a season. But the potential – if he were to win the treble and win FIFA's player of the year award – exists to push the final figure over the £110m (€122m) mark.</p>

<p>Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu is reluctant to punish Messi given his status at the club</p>

<p>Messi informed new Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman of his desire to leave the Nou Camp</p>

<p>Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu is reluctant to punish Messi given his status at the club.</p>

<p>The Argentina star believed that he was free to leave Barcelona due to a clause in his contract which gave him the option to depart at the end of the season. </p>

<p>However, LaLiga ruled that as Messi did not state his desire to leave before June 10, his release clause of £630m (£700m) would still have to paid in order for him to leave. Messi's contract is set to expire at the end of June next year. </p>

<p>Messi has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester City, which would see him reunite with former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola. </p>

<p>After Barcelona ended the season without a trophy, Messi informed Barcelona new manager Ronald Koeman of his desire to leave the club.  </p>
