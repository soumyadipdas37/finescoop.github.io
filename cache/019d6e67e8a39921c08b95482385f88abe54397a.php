<p>A young west Melbourne mother was forced to chase off a man who grabbed her daughter as the young girl cycled to childcare on Tuesday morning</p>

<p>'My son wanted to race me so I sped off with him. Keirah wasn't far behind me - but when I stopped and turned around I saw there was this man grabbing my daughter and spinning her around,' she told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>The mother said she and her children had never felt like they were in danger in their neighbourhood until Tuesday.</p>

<p>CCTV footage showed the man - who is described as being of African appearance, in his early 20s, wearing dark clothes and a white baseball cap but no mask - stood beside the child before bending down to her height.  </p>

<p>Keirah suffered a small cut to her right hand when the man grabbed her and is still suffering from soreness on one of her arms.</p>

<p>Seconds before the offender grabbed the young girl, he had calmly walked past her mother and her brother - raising no alarm bells for Rebekah who thought he was just a normal pedestrian.</p>

<p>Rebekah said the youngster bravely went to childcare despite what happened, but struggled to sleep on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Keirah's mother said she struggled to get to sleep that night as she was scared the man was going to come back and grab her</p>

<p>Keirah is enjoying the media attention the attempted snatching has attracted and her mother said the family were undeterred in cycling to childcare in the future</p>

<p>'She was scared the man was going to come and get her again so her dad had to lie with her to get her to go to sleep,' Rebekah said.</p>

<p>Pictured: The cut Keirah suffered to her right hand when the man grabbed her</p>

<p>'When we got to a spot today near where the man grabbed her she was hesitant and I had to tell her she was safe to keep going.'</p>

<p>Despite the scary incident, Rebekah said Keirah was enjoying the media attention the attempted snatching has attracted.</p>

<p>'She loves it. This morning she had the news microphone and was singing into it,' the mum said.</p>

<p>'My kids love riding their bikes and I'm not going to let one person ruin their childhood.'  </p>

<p>Victoria Police said on Wednesday they were increasing patrols in the Harkness area and are treating the incident as 'extremely serious'.</p>

<p>The family were riding their bikes along Weeks Avenue, Harkness, outer-west Melbourne , at 9.20am on Tuesday </p>

<p>CCTV footage showed the man stood beside the child before bending to her height (google street view, pictured)</p>

<p>'It's a traumatic situation for anyone to undergo,' Detective Acting Senior Sergeant David Leveridge told reporters.</p>

<p>'Until we speak to the person concerned we have to treat it as extremely serious.'</p>

<p> Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. </p>
