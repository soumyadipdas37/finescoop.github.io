<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Prosecutors in Germany insist they do not need Madeline McCann's body in order to prosecute the man they believe killed the youngster.</p>

<p>Braunschweig-based Hans Christian Wolters claims the authorities simply need to be 'convinced' she is dead to be able to put a suspect on trial. </p>

<p>The statement will lead to increased speculation that prosecutors are moving closer to charging the prime suspect in the youngster's disappearance - Christian Brueckner.</p>

<p>The 43-year-old convicted paedophile and rapist is currently in jail in Germany. As yet no charges have been brought against him over the toddler's disappearance.</p>

<p>Mr Wolters has already indicated recently that they had 'material evidence' that Madeline was dead.</p>

<p>He told investigative reporter Sandra Felgueiras, on RTP show Sexta as 9, last night: 'To indict someone we don't need a body.</p>

<p>'A person can be convicted without a body being found but we have to be convinced a person is dead.'</p>

<p>He also appeared to hint that German authorities may have evidence placing paedophile Brueckner in the Praia da Luz holiday flat the British youngster vanished from on May 3, 2007.</p>

<p>When asked if he had any forensic evidence placing Brueckner inside the flat where Madeline was sleeping, Mr Wolters replied: 'I have an answer but we have decided not to divulge this information.</p>

<p>'I can't say 'yes' or 'no' as that would bring a thousand other questions and I cannot go into details.</p>

<p>'But you have to believe me when I say we have more evidence.</p>

<p>'Here in Germany our Public Ministry only divulges things when they are solid.'</p>

<p>Mr Wolters added, however, that prosecutors were no nearer to identifying the person who made a half hour phone call to Brueckner on his mobile while he was near the Ocean Club complex shortly after Madeline disappeared. </p>

<p>The call came from a Portuguese mobile which detectives have been unable to trace, despite a large police appeal.</p>

<p>Mr Wolters said: 'We have the number that called him but we haven't managed to attribute that number to anyone at the moment.</p>

<p>'We don't know what the conversation was about and we don't know the relationship between the people who spoke.</p>

<p>'We are searching for a witness to establish the content of the conversation which lasted nearly half an hour and so was quite a long conversation.</p>

<p>'We hope someone remembers that conversation. We don't have any reason to believe that person could be involved in what happened that night to Madeleine.'</p>

<p>He added that there was no smoking gun evidence to link Brueckner to the crime but insisted that there was many pieces of the Madeline puzzle pointing towards the suspect.</p>

<p>The solicitor also said that prosecutors are sure that the British youngster is dead despite British police treating the case as a missing person inquiry.</p>

<p>He said: 'Everything we have points to her being dead. We have no margin of manoeuvre.'</p>

<p>Mr Wolters also stressed that German police do not believe the chief Madeline McCann suspect had an accomplice and described his ex-girlfriend Nicole Fehlinger as a witness.</p>

<p>Brueckner's lawyer Friedrich Fulscher has insisted his client, currently serving a 21-month drug sentence in prison in the German city of Kiel, has nothing to do with Madeleine's disappearance.</p>

<p>Brueckner is also being probed in Germany over a 2004 Algarve rape and a sex attack on a beach near Praia da Luz a month before Madeleine vanished.</p>

<p>In Portugal prosecutors have reopened their investigation into a sex crime in a playground he was arrested over in 2017.</p>

<p>He was held on suspicion of exposing himself to young children at a playground in Sao Bartolomeu de Messines a 40-minute drive from Praia de Luz.</p>

<p>Police discovered after his detention that he was wanted in Germany on an international arrest warrant for child sex abuse and possession of child pornography.</p>

<p>He was extradited to his homeland and was never prosecuted in Portugal following his Algarve arrest.</p>

<p>The criminal probe was mothballed despite protests from the youngsters' angry parents but reopened earlier this month.</p>

<p>On Thursday Brueckner was told he would remain in jail after losing a legal challenge against an earlier extradition from Italy to Germany which he insisted should lead to him being freed early.</p>

<p>The ruling means he will now stay in jail until 2024 at least.</p>
