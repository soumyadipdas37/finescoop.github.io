<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian woman has ignited a fierce debate on social media after posting an image of cocktail frankfurts with tomato sauce and asking people what they typically call them.</p>

<p>The image, which was shared on Facebook on August 29, became a topic of discussion after people realised there were a range of very unique terms used to describe the popular party snacks.</p>

<p>'A conversation about the name of these is going crazy in another group I'm in. So what do you call them? I say cheerios and my partner calls them mini franks,' she said. </p>

<p>The image, which was shared on Facebook on August 29, became a prominent topic of discussion after people realised there were plenty of names people used to describe the small platter product</p>

<p>What do you call these?</p>

<p>What do you call these?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>The seemingly innocent search for answers turned into a 3,000 comment strong investigation.</p>

<p>'I call them little boys but if you over boil them they become little girls,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'I call these mini saveloys, which is another name for a hot dog,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'I call them little red boys actually'.</p>

<p>One lady said that as a child living in the 1970s and 80s in New South Wales her mother called them cocktail franks as opposed to the larger frankfurts. </p>

<p>But when she brought up her own children in Queensland come the late 1990s and early 2000s she noticed they were called cheerios.</p>

<p>'I wasn't sure if it was a state or generational thing,' she said.</p>

<p>Others said they'd heard the term 'footy franks' on popular Aussie sitcom Kath and Kim and continued to use it in their day-to-day life.</p>

<p>There were terms like 'red hot lovers', 'red sausages', 'cocktail weenies' and 'little weenies' in the comments section, which were the more unusual suggestions.</p>

<p>Cocktail frankfurts are made out of finely textured meat including pork, seasoned with white pepper, garlic, cumin and chilli. </p>

<p>They are then filled into an edible collagen casing and cooked.</p>

<p>They are usually served at barbecues or as part of larger platter plates alongside cheese and different types of ham and lots of tomato sauce or ketchup. </p>
