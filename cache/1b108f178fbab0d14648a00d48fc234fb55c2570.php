<p>Beaming in the sea-filled snap, Jacqueline captioned the post 'Unedited but hell she is breathing in!!', explaining that it was completely untouched after previously showing her followers the power of editing apps.    </p>

<p>It came days after she claimed that celebrities who edit their social media snaps must be 'insecure'.</p>

<p>Gorgeous: Jacqueline also recently took to Instagram to post a gallery of snaps featuring her latest collaboration with fashion brand In The Style</p>

<p>In a series of videos to Instagram Stories, the ITV darling insisted she didn't have any qualms with making small tweaks to snaps, but thought it was a 'bit crazy' for users to completely change their body shape.</p>

<p>Jacqueline also shared her own attempt at altering a selfie she'd taken after jetting abroad on her family holiday with husband Dan and their kids.   </p>

<p>In a series of videos, Jacqueline explained this was her first attempt at using an editing app, and reminded her fans that not all social media snaps are as they seem. </p>

<p>The star, who shared several looks from her autumn/winter In The Style range on Instagram on Monday, demonstrated how she managed to change her own face to give the illusion of 'a full face of make-up.'</p>

<p>Jacqueline explained: 'I wanted you guys to know and see how easy it is and how much you can't really tell and that everybody does it.</p>

<p>'So you know when you looking at people thinking, ''they look flawless and absolutely amazing'', the majority they don't.' </p>

<p>Jacqueline has previously spoken out in support of body confidence after revealing she is planning to kick-start an exercise routine. </p>

<p>The star, who has embraced her size 12-14 figure, said on Instagram last month: 'I'm having those thoughts of I need to start doing a bit for me and I'm going to try and go for walks and maybe do some exercise. </p>

<p>It comes after Jacqueline revealed she finally 'doesn't care' about being a size 12 to 14, after sharing a candid snap of her figure in a bikini from different camera angles. </p>

<p>The I'm A Celebrity winner said she has finally accepted her curves and embraced being a 'plus-sized' woman, but hasn't ruled out the idea of hitting the gym to lose weight.  </p>
