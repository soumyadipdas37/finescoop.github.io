<p>Speaking to film industry website Screen Daily, producer John Battsek told the Mirror: 'A layer of the film is Sir Alex in recovery, grappling with the threat of the loss of his memory, that being the memory of the greatest football manager that ever lived. </p>

<p>'It's Sir Alex's real-life story from growing up in Govan in Glasgow, his career as a footballer and as a football manager to his battle recovering from the brain haemorrhage.</p>

<p>'It is a father-son story and a love story - the story of him and his amazing wife.</p>

<p>'Jason had already recorded 50 hours of audio with his dad and his father trusted him, really trusted him.</p>

<p>'We felt that if we surrounded Jason with all sorts of experienced hands, he could handle it. He has done a phenomenal job.' </p>
