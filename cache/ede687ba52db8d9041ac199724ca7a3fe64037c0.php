<p>'And that says a lot about this world and where we are headed. I’m messy, I’m real and I’m working on healing.' </p>

<p>An insider previously told Us Weekly that the pair had 'been very private about this and friends are shocked to hear the news because they seemed happy together publicly and while in front of others.'</p>
