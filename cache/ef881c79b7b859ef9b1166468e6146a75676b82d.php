<p>At least 20 suspected migrants landed on Kent shores today, while 40 were brought into the busy Kent port aboard Border Force patrol boats. </p>

<p>They were then seen being escorted up the gangway to the harbourside, where they will be processed by immigration officials.</p>

<p>A large group, including an Iraqi family of five with children aged six and seven, dodged Border Force to reach Kingsdown, Kent, on a huge green inflatable boat.  </p>

<p>Another group of three Asian migrants, wrapped in blankets and wearing lifejackets, also made it to shore at Folkestone this morning.  </p>

<p>After a lull in people attempting the dangerous crossing over the last few days, crossings resumed in large numbers amid low winds.</p>

<p>It is understood more dinghies believed to be carrying migrants remain in the Channel and are being monitored by the Coastguard.</p>

<p>The latest arrivals come despite Home Secretary Priti Patel's vow to make the route 'unviable', and the continued row between the Home Office and the legal profession on how to tackle the crossings.  </p>

<p>One Border Force rib was later seen towing four dinghies into Kent harbour, which are believed to have been used by the migrants.</p>

<p>The Coastguard, the RNLI and the Border Force cutter Seeker are all active this morning responding to migrants making the dangerous journey. French patrol forces are also active across the water border.   </p>

<p>Responding to reports of more migrant crossings today, Nigel Farage said: 'Total chaos in the Channel this morning. Border Force can't cope, there have been several beach landings and some migrants have now disappeared into the hills.'</p>

<p>It comes after 17 refugees crammed on one boat reached the UK yesterday.</p>

<p>So far in September, a staggering 826 migrants have arrived over six days, including a single-day record of 416 on 28 boats on September 2.</p>

<p>At least 5,851 migrants have reached Britain so far this year. </p>

<p>Border Force officials have detained 223 migrants in 18 dinghies after they crossed the English Channel to reach the UK on Monday - as French authorities stopped another 106 people making the crossing.</p>

<p>More migrants have been setting out from the coast of France while the weather is warm in a desperate attempt to reach the UK before autumn.    </p>

<p>Dan O'Mahoney, Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, said he has been working with counterparts in France to 'make this route completely unviable'.  </p>

<p>They also revealed a further 106 people in eight boats were stopped by French authorities before they could get into UK waters. </p>

<p>Mr O'Mahoney said: 'These crossings are facilitated by criminals willing to risk people's lives for money. </p>

<p>'France is a safe country with a fully functioning asylum system - those seeking refuge can and should claim asylum there.</p>

<p>'I continue to work with my counterparts in France on a daily basis to make this route completely unviable, and this morning the French stopped more migrants leaving the coastline - though I recognise the number still reaching the UK remains too high.</p>

<p>'We continue to return those who do not have a legitimate asylum claim despite barriers to removals under the Dublin Regulations and legal challenges.'  </p>
