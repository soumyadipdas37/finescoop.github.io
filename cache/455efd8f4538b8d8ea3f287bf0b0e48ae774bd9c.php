<p>He said what? The sighting comes one day after Beauvais hosted the latest episode of her podcast Going To Bed With Garcelle, on which her old costar Jamie Foxx appeared</p>

<p>Back in the day: The Oscar winner, who starred opposite Garcelle in The Jamie Foxx Show from 1996 to 2001, said he though that they 'should have been together' in real life during their chat</p>

<p>During the cheerful conversation Garcelle told Jamie: 'By the way, you never really give any guy that I’m with any real attention.'</p>

<p>In response, Jamie dished that this was 'Because me and you, we should’ve been together. So every time I see him, I was like: "Damn, I f***ed up."'</p>

<p>The result is that whenever he meets a beau of hers 'I give him a real s***y look,' to which Garcelle replied: 'I feel it! I feel it and they feel it.' </p>

<p>During the cheerful conversation Garcelle told Jamie: 'By the way, you never really give any guy that I’m with any real attention'; seen with fellow guest, stylist Mayasha Long</p>

<p>Both of them declared themselves 'single' on the podcast, as did decorator and stylist Mayasha Long who was Jamie's fellow guest on the episode. </p>

<p>During the chat, Jamie and Garcelle also jokingly agreed that they are 'in a relationship forever,' and she added, rather saucily, that he is 'also hung like a horse.' </p>
