<p>Governor Dethrat Simsiri said that 68 people were wounded by three blasts that occurred within a 100m radius and just minutes apart.</p>

<p>He told Thai television many of the injured were hit by the third bomb, hidden in a car, as they gathered at the scene.  A total of 23 remained in hospital he said. </p>

<p>'We are not sure which group of suspected Muslim insurgents were behind this but we are looking,' he said.</p>

<p>The first bomb was hidden inside a motorcycle parked near a shopping area and detonated by a mobile phone at about noon, the governor said.</p>

<p>Within minutes, a second bomb hidden in another motorcycle exploded, followed by a third explosion from a device placed in a car that set fire to nearby buildings, he said.</p>

<p>Yala, Narathiwat and Pattani are the only Muslim-dominated provinces in the predominantly Buddhist country.</p>

<p>Separately, a blast occurred at a hotel in the city of Hat Yai, in the nearby province of Songkhla, that officials attributed to a gas leak and said was unrelated to the attacks blamed on insurgents.</p>

<p>Several tourists staying at the Lee Gardens Hotel where the blast took place suffered from smoke inhalation after the midday explosion, which occurred in a Japanese restaurant on the ground floor of the hotel, said police.</p>
