<p>'Scary, frustrating and lonely': Packed To The Rafters star Hugh Sheridan, 35, has tested positive for COVID-19</p>

<p>Hugh had jetted into Australia from Los Angeles mid-August, and at the time was forced to undergo a mandatory 14-day stay inside a quarantine hotel. </p>

<p>'I had a negative result when I arrived (in Australia). I now know all my friends including [those] who took me to LAX airport are all negative so it's been confusing for me, it's scary, frustrating and lonely,' he said. </p>

<p>Despite his positive test result, the House Husbands star confirmed he has never experienced any symptoms of COVID-19.  </p>

<p>'I got it in a very short space of time': In a lengthy Instagram post, Hugh explained that he'd somehow caught the deadly virus in transit from Los Angeles to Australia last month</p>

<p>'I am SO LUCKY &amp; I keep reminding myself to count each blessing 1 by 1. To everyone: this virus is seriously clever. Knowing now, that no one I saw back home overseas has it means I got it in a very short space of time (in transit or a surface) while I had minimal human contact,' he wrote. </p>

<p>Hugh went on to thank the health workers that have assisted him so far, including Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital's new virtual healthcare service for providing information and emotional support. </p>

<p>He also admitted his mental health has suffered as a result of the diagnosis.   </p>

<p>'I wanted to be honest with you because we all have good days and not so good days': Hugh admitted his mental health has suffered as a result of the diagnosis</p>

<p>'I wanted to be honest with you because we all have good days and not so good days and without days like my last few the good ones wouldn’t feel as good!' the mental health advocate explained. </p>

<p>'To everyone that received a positive Covid test, I now know how that feels, I wish we could all be together so we could offer each other a shoulder or even better a HUG!' he continued.</p>

<p>Hugh announced that he will be taking time out from social media and focussing on editing his new script.  </p>

<p>'Why oh why did I not come with a friend?!!' Hugh uploaded this post last month as he began his 14-day stay inside a quarantine hotel, after arriving in Australia from Los Angeles </p>

<p>'If I’m not on social media as much it’s not necessarily cause I’m down, it’s cause it can make me feel a little worse for the moment,' he confessed. </p>

<p>'This too shall pass. I AM OK! #somuchlove,' he finished.  </p>

<p>Hugh's celebrity friends rushed to share messages of support.  </p>
