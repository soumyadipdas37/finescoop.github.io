<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fitness entrepreneur Steph Claire Smith has been forced to defend herself after she was slammed for wearing a face mask at a beach in Melbourne.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old model shared a seemingly innocent picture on Instagram showing her wearing a bikini, along with a blue face covering on Sunday.</p>

<p>In her social media post, she explained how she was 'incredibly grateful' to travel to a beach within her 5km radius from her home after COVID-19 restrictions eased to allow residents to go outside for up to two hours a day for socialising and exercising.</p>

<p>'It's the little things... Just getting to sit on the beach for an hour without having to "exercise" as an excuse to be there was heavenly,' Steph wrote.</p>

<p>But critics quickly took issue with her for wearing a face mask at the beach, while others criticised the state's 'tyranny' coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>Fitness entrepreneur Steph Claire Smith (pictured) has been forced to defend herself against critics after she was slammed for wearing a face mask at a beach</p>

<p>In her social media post, she explained how she was 'incredibly grateful' to travel to a beach within her 5km radius from her home after COVID-19 restrictions eased to allow residents to go outside for up to two hours of socialising and exercising</p>

<p>Steph has since defended herself, saying she was simply following the state's mandatory rules of wearing a face mask in public</p>

<p>Wearing a face covering is mandatory across Victoria but some online trolls demanded her to 'take off the mask' while others questioned her decision to cover up at the beach.</p>

<p>'Don't understand the mask out in the open fresh air,' one wrote, while another added: 'The mask don't work, why are you wearing it?'</p>

<p>Another person said: 'Take off the mask! Just because the government makes something law doesn't make it right. It's clearly not about health when you have to wear a mask even when outside or not in a crowded place.' </p>

<p>One mother, who doesn't live in Victoria, criticised the 'tyranny' state, saying: 'What a place to live. 23 hour home detention, mandatory masks anytime you leave the house, one hour exercise within 5km, no church, funerals, weddings, drone surveillance... yikes! No thank you.' </p>

<p>Some even accused her of 'promoting' the face covering to her 1.5 million followers. </p>

<p>'She puts it on Instagram... To promote it... I guess she gets paid from it. It is not really her job to advocate people to think but it is a bit scary that people follow so easy,' one claimed. </p>

<p>But Steph has addressed the criticism on her Instagram story, saying she was simply following the state's rules of wearing a face mask in public.</p>

<p>Under the restrictions, all Victorians must wear a face covering when they leave home or they can be slapped with fines unless they have a lawful excuse for not wearing a face covering. </p>

<p>Steph has since defended herself, saying she was simply following the state's mandatory rules of wearing a face mask in public</p>

<p>Despite the backlash, dozens of fans quickly jumped to Steph's defence, with many firing back at the 'ridiculous' comments </p>

<p>'To all the people questioning me wearing a mask or thinking it's ridiculous, here in Melbourne we have to wear one anytime we're outside of the house,' Steph wrote. </p>

<p>'Now I'm not going to argue your points, some are fair and some are not. But no, I am absolutely not getting paid to wear a mask and promote it.</p>

<p>'I just wanted a photo at the beach... and didn't want to bend the rules or promote breaking the law by not wearing a mask.' </p>

<p>Despite the backlash, dozens of fans quickly jumped to her defence, with many firing back at the 'ridiculous' comments.</p>

<p>'It was a cracking weekend here in Melbourne and the beach was probably pretty packed with other people enjoying some Vitamin D... just because she's alone in the picture doesn't mean she was alone on an entire beach,' one woman wrote.</p>

<p>A second woman said: 'So stop asking her why she's wearing a mask at the beach. Unless your living in Melbourne yourself you have no idea what it's like to live with these restrictions.' </p>

<p>All Victorians must wear a face covering when they leave home, no matter where they live, to minimise the spread of COVID-19.</p>

<p>This includes travelling on public transport, or with people outside of your household. You are not required to wear a face covering when driving with someone from your household, or if you are driving for work purposes on your own, for example, if you are a delivery driver. </p>

<p>Fines will be applied to people who do not wear a face covering unless they have a valid reason for an exemption. </p>

<p>You must carry a face covering with you unless you have a lawful excuse for not wearing a face covering such as a medical condition or are under the age of 12. You can also use a scarf or bandana instead of a face covering.</p>
