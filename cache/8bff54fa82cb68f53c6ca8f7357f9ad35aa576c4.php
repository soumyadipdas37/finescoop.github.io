<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A thrifty mum has revealed how she got more than six meals from a leg of ham, after she bought one for $23 and decided to challenge herself to see how much she could cook with it.</p>

<p>The Australian woman, called Amanda, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, where she  revealed exactly what she made with her $23.54 purchase from Coles - and how much she has saved by buying such a large amount.</p>

<p>'I thought I'd buy a whole leg of ham and see how far it got me,' she posted on Facebook. </p>

<p>'It was $8 per kilo, 2.9 kilos, and cost $23.54 all up.' </p>

<p>A thrifty mum has revealed how she got more than six meals from a leg of ham, after she bought one for $23 and decided to challenge herself to see how much she could cook with it</p>

<p>The Australian woman, called Amanda, posted on Facebook on Tuesday, where she revealed exactly what she made with her $23.54 purchase from Coles - and how much she saved</p>

<p>Using the ham, Amanda said she got two cups of diced ham for two separate pasta bakes, one piece for a roast meal, one 'meaty bone' for a soup and 750 grams of sliced ham for sandwiches.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Pasta bake x 2</p></li>
<li><p>Roast meal</p></li>
<li><p>Ham soup</p></li>
<li><p>Sliced ham sandwiches</p></li>
<li><p>Ham for dog food</p></li>
<li><p>Ham pork crackling </p></li>
</ul>

<p>She also got a 'bagful of scraps to add to dog food' and used the skin to make pork crackling.</p>

<p>'I reckon it was definitely worth it,' she said. </p>

<p>'$8 a kilogram is $20 cheaper than ham from the deli.'</p>

<p>Hundreds of people online who saw her post said they would try the approach for themselves.</p>

<p>'That is so good! I've not thought of doing this before. I would love to give it a go,' one person posted.</p>

<p>'Ham steaks are a fave here. Bulk meat and cut your own saves heaps,' another added.</p>

<p>A third said she did similar recently, spending around $13 on her ham with a $10 off card from Woolworths.</p>

<p>'We got around 15 meals from it, plus we used the bone for soup so that was another five meals,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Great value for the price.' </p>

<p>In the past, a mother-of-one from rural western Australia called Liz Stephenson shared her secrets for shopping on a budget, after revealing she spends just $50 a week on groceries</p>

<p>Liz swears by doing a meal plan for the month before she goes, as well as shopping from home before curating a menu and then bulk buying and freezing what she doesn't immediately use</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Shop monthly instead of weekly to avoid temptation.</p></li>
<li><p>Do 'Click and Collect' to save you from having to go into the supermarket.</p></li>
<li><p>Do a meal plan for the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Shop your pantry before you go to the supermarket.</p></li>
<li><p>Bulk buy and freeze what you don't use.</p></li>
<li><p>Grow your own if you can, whether it's herbs, fruit or vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat meals throughout the month.</p></li>
<li><p>Use leftovers for lunch or pre-prepare lunches for the week.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, a mother-of-one from rural western Australia called Liz Stephenson shared her secrets for shopping on a budget.</p>

<p>Liz said she feeds herself, her husband and their 17-year-old son with a strict budget of $50 per week, as well as countless guests. </p>

<p>She doesn't go to the supermarket very often because she lives 45km from the nearest Coles and Woolworths and there is no Aldi close by.</p>

<p>'I do Click and Collect so I don't step foot in to the supermarket, which means I don't make any impulse buys and can see the total before I check out,' she said.</p>

<p>Liz also swears by doing a meal plan for the month before she goes, as well as shopping from home before curating a menu and then bulk buying and freezing what she doesn't immediately use.</p>

<p>Alongside these more conventional shopping secrets, the mum-of-one said she does a few other things that save her family valuable money.</p>

<p>'We grow our own lamb, which is included in the twice-weekly meal plan (roasts, loin chops, diced four quarters and shanks) and also have a summer and winter vegetable garden and fruit trees,' Liz said.</p>

<p>During July, she is harvesting broccoli, snow peas, kale, spinach, carrots cabbage and also grows herbs including basil, parsley, oregano and rosemary.</p>
