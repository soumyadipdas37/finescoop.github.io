<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cat owners who rarely find a dead mouse on their doorstep may think that their pet takes little interest in hunting for prey.</p>

<p>But they may in fact have a covert killer on their hands.</p>

<p>A study using miniature cameras suggests that pet cats bring home very few of the creatures they actually kill.</p>

<p>Researchers asked the owners of 105 suburban cats to monitor how many animals their pets brought home for ten weeks in summer and six in winter.</p>

<p>'Kitty-cam' study shows pet cats bring home very few of the creatures they actually kill (stock image)</p>

<p>They then followed 20 cats using tiny video cameras attached to their bodies. </p>

<p>The results suggested 82 per cent of the prey caught was not returned home.</p>

<p>The research, published in the Global Ecology and Conservation journal, was conducted in South Africa but could be applicable to the UK, the team said.</p>

<p>Another 'kitty-cam' study by Arizona State University found a similar rate of non-returned prey at 77 per cent.</p>

<p>Study author Rob Simmons, of the University of Cape Town, said: 'If you think of it in biological terms, other solitary cats like leopards will store their larger prey in trees and eat it there later.</p>

<p>Researchers followed 20 cats using mini video cameras to monitor their movements and found that 82 per cent of prey they caught was not returned home. Pictured: Cat eating a pheasant</p>

<p>'I believe cats bring home their larger prey to possibly consume it later, although they often don't because they are well fed.</p>

<p>'So the smaller prey are eaten in situ because they are easy to eat - there's no need to bring them home. Some are abandoned because they are not worth eating or may be unpalatable.'</p>

<p>He advised some simple measures to help reduce predation by cats, such as the wearing of bells, and being kept in at night, when most hunting occurs. </p>

<p>Owners could also consider the building of a large enclosure - a 'catio' - so they could have time outside as well as inside.</p>

<p>He concluded: 'Globally cats have been the direct cause of extinction of over 60 species of birds, mammals and reptiles. All unnecessary.'</p>
