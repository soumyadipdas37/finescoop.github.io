<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex today denied claims they had agreed to star in a fly-on-the-wall Netflix reality series with cameras following them for three months.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle were said to have been hoping to 'give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do', according to a source.</p>

<p>But a spokesman for the royal couple insisted today: 'The Duke and Duchess are not taking part in any reality shows.' </p>

<p>It comes after Harry and Meghan signed a £112million Netflix deal to make TV series, films and children's shows for the streaming service.</p>

<p>Reports had suggested Harry and Meghan would be followed for three months amid the possibility of cameras being allowed into their home in Montecito, California. </p>

<p>But the couple moved to deny the claims in a statement issued this afternoon. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex talk about voting in the US election during a TV appearance to mark Time magazine's 100 most influential people roll call last week</p>

<p>A source had told The Sun: 'They may have had all these lofty ideas about producing epics highlighting environmental causes and the poverty gap, but Netflix obviously want their pound of flesh.</p>

<p>'It will all be very tasteful, and not Katie Price and Peter Andre-style reality TV, but they want to give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do.'</p>

<p>According to the source, much of the series was to be about their philanthropic work rather than what they get up to behind closed doors.</p>

<p>But they added: 'It will still be a fascinating insight and Meghan hopes viewers will get to see the real her.'</p>

<p>Speaking about the claims, Ingrid Seward, Editor of Majesty magazine, would be 'hypocritical' if they had agreed to the reality series after they left the UK for the US for greater privacy. </p>

<p>And PR executive Mark Borkowski had told The Sun: 'Viewers will be interested to see what they are up to but there needs to be authenticity. They have laid out a grand plan and are fulfilling it. They are doing this all on their own terms.'</p>

<p>Meghan (pictured on September 23) - who was starring in legal drama Suits when she met Harry - is said to have made it clear she has no plans to return to acting</p>

<p>Netflix has said it already has several projects in development but declined to offer more information.</p>

<p>A Netflix spokesman said: 'The couple already has several projects in development, including an innovative nature docu-series and an animated series that celebrates inspiring women but we are not disclosing any of the programming slate at this time.'</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan stepped down as working royals at the end of March for personal and financial freedom.</p>

<p>The couple have set up a production firm to create their films and documentaries and are committed to diverse hiring practices for its key roles, Netflix has indicated.</p>

<p>The duchess has already started her life in the commercial world, narrating a Disney film about a family of elephants and their journey across Africa that was available to stream in April.</p>

<p>The co-founder of Netflix promised earlier this month that the films and TV shows produced as part of the couple's deal would be Netflix's 'most viewed' content next year.</p>

<p>Reed Hastings said the couple had been 'smart' in 'shopping' their programme-making talents around 'all the major companies' before signing with Netflix.</p>

<p>Mr Hastings dismissed critics who questioned whether the former royals' desire to create 'impactful content that unlocks action' would be good entertainment.</p>

<p>He told American news channel CNBC: 'It's going to be epic entertainment. I'm so excited about that deal.</p>

<p>'They're smart, they were shopping it around across all the major companies and I think we really put together the best complete package.</p>

<p>'We're going to do a wide range of entertainment with them. I can't tell you anymore than that about it at this point, but I think it will be some of the most exciting, most viewed content next year.'</p>

<p>It is understood the couple may appear on camera in their documentaries but Meghan - who was starring in legal drama Suits when she met Harry - is said to have made it clear she has no plans to return to acting.</p>

<p>Asked about the subject, Mr Hastings said: 'The real focus for them is on being producers and on building that production capacity.</p>

<p>'That's the key thing. They've developed a great eye for story and we'll be working with them on that basis.'</p>

<p>The lucrative deal already appears to have helped the couple further sever ties from the Royal Family, as it was announced that they reimbursed taxpayers in full for the £2.4million used to renovate their Windsor home, Frogmore Cottage.</p>

<p>Last week, the Duke and Duchess were accused of 'over-stepping the line' after a thinly-veiled swipe at Donald Trump as they urged Americans to get out and vote in the upcoming election.</p>

<p>In the couple's most high-profile intervention in the US presidential election, Harry urged voters to 'reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity' – all qualities critics associate with Mr Trump.</p>

<p>In a TV appearance to mark Time magazine's 100 most influential people roll call, Meghan – who has made no secret of her antipathy towards the president – described November's vote as the most important election of her lifetime.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harry complained that he had never been able to exercise his democratic right to vote because of the convention that, as a member of the British Royal Family, he should remain politically neutral.</p>
