<p>Ted, a nine-week-old Maremma puppy, lived on the Green Acres Hobby Farm in Moolboolaman, near Gin Gin, in Queensland with fellow dogs Tippy and Fay. </p>

<p>The fluffy little pup loved the older dogs and followed the pair everywhere they went.</p>

<p>He was left devastated when both died suddenly of suspected 1080 poisoning on August 31. </p>

<p>A farmer has captured the heartbreaking moment his puppy named Ted refused to leave the his best friends grave site after their sudden death</p>

<p>Ted (pictured with Tippy), a nine-week-old Maremma puppy, lived on the Green Acres Hobby Farm in Moolboolaman, near Gin Gin, in Queensland with fellow dogs Tippy and Fay</p>

<p>Ted and Tippy (pictured) would play together all the time, owner Pat Jackson said they were 'best buddies'</p>

<p>Owner Greg Jackson had found Tippy screaming in agony early that morning. </p>

<p>Before he had a chance to even call for help the two-year-old Border collie kelpie cross was dead. </p>

<p>Mr Jackson called his wife Pat moments later in tears to break the news.</p>

<p>'In 47 years of marriage I had never heard my husband sound so distressed, sobbing and crying,' Mrs Jackson said. </p>

<p>Hours later, when Mr Jackson returned home from an appointment, he found seven-year-old Fay laying stiff with her mouth wide open. She had died too.</p>

<p>Their sudden passing shocked the couple. </p>

<p>Mr Jackson chose to bury both loyal working dogs side by side on their property. </p>

<p>The couple got Ted so he could be mentored by Fay, who is a seven-year-old livestock guardian dog</p>

<p>But once the grave was covered tiny Ted refused to leave. </p>

<p>The small pup lay down on the patch of dirt looking downcast.  </p>

<p>'Greg had to literally pick him up and put him into the car to take him home,' Mrs Jackson said.</p>

<p>'The pup, we got him so he could be mentored by Fay because she was getting on in years, Fay was not in a playful mood, but him and Tippy just played together all the time. They were great buddies.' </p>

<p>Two weeks on and the family is still struggling with their loss. </p>

<p>'It's tough we're having our moments still,' Mrs Jackson said. </p>

<p>'Ted's going quite well, really happy little dog, you can see he;s probably missing his playmates.'</p>

<p>The couple suspect the dogs died after eating sodium fluoroacetate, commonly known by its brand name of 1080.</p>

<p>The chemical is a highly toxic pesticide used to kill pests, including feral dogs, foxes, cats, rabbits, pigs, and in some cases, native wildlife. </p>

<p>However, it is easily ingested as it is odourless, tasteless and colourless. </p>

<p>The Jacksons don't know how the chemical got onto their property but believe a bird may have dropped it.</p>

<p>The couple is now calling for 1080 to be banned in Australia. </p>

<p>However, it is easily ingested as it is odourless, tasteless and colourless. </p>

<p>'Even with the feral dogs it's a cruel and painful death,' Mrs Jackson said. </p>

<p>A petition launched calling for an investigation into the dog's deaths amassed more than 2,000 signatures in less than two days.</p>

<p>Across Australia, people must have a permit to place baits, and there must be notification in the areas where they can be found. </p>

<p>1080 is used for poisoning wild dogs and other predators</p>

<p>It comes in the form of a white powder</p>

<p>It's added to fresh or dry animal baits</p>

<p>It's only available in Australia to those who are authorised to use it</p>

<p>After digestion of 1080, most dogs and foxes will die in up to two hours</p>

<p>The central nervous system becomes effected which leads to unconsciousness. </p>
