<p>Tessa, who revealed she's attracted to both men and women in 2018, was previously linked to singer Janelle Monae. </p>

<p>Last month, the producer said she feels 'compelled to be an agent of change' in an interview with NET-A-PORTER's digital title, PORTER. </p>

<p>She explained: 'I don't think any artist necessarily has a responsibility to try being an agent of change. But, for me, it's always been something that feels compelling. </p>

<p> 'And if there's a risk in speaking up, it's always felt worth it. I'm just continuing to try to learn how to show up in those spaces and to pass the mic to folks who know a lot more than me.'</p>

<p>The Westworld star also insisted she's not afraid to lose work for taking a stance about matters of importance to her. </p>

<p>She shared: 'Anyone who wouldn't want to work with me because I'm a person at this time fighting [that] the value and dignity of Black lives need to be protected… I really don't want to work with them.</p>

<p>'It's my life and it's important that my core values line up with my creative ecosystem.' </p>
