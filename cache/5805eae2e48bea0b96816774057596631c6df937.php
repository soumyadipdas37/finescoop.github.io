<p>West Brom 2-2 Brentford (4-5 pens)</p>

<p>Luton 0-3 Manchester United</p>

<p>A flattering scoreline for United, who had to work hard until the closing stages.</p>

<p>Greenwood wraps it up with a deserved goal!</p>

<p>He picks up the ball on the right, performs a couple of step-overs and places one into the far corner.</p>

<p>The substitutes really changed this game.</p>

<p>Greenwood causing all sorts of problems. This time he plays in Lingard on the left, who fires a powerful strike just over.</p>

<p>Two minutes of added time to come.</p>

<p>89 mins: Greenwood shows nice feet on the right hand side of the box before forcing a save out of Shea at his near post.</p>

<p>Game over.</p>

<p>United break and Greenwood holds up the ball on the edge of the box before allowing Rashford to take over. The Englishman bursts into the box and finishes with aplomb.</p>

<p>81 mins: Henderson 's first United save and it's a great one!</p>

<p>Tom Lockyear's back post header is destined for the net before the new United stopper sticks out a hand. The follow up is cleared off the line.</p>

<p>Three subs for the visitors as Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood replace Juan Mata, Odion Ighalo and Donny van de Beek.</p>

<p>Two changes for Luton as Harry Cornick replaces Jordan Clark and Elliot Lee comes on for George Moncur.</p>

<p>68 mins: Peter Kioso picks up a yellow for a late on on Bailly.</p>

<p>63 mins: Off the line!</p>

<p>United break in numbers and Ighalo chooses to go alone, his shot blocked by a defender.</p>

<p>Mata retrieves it on the right and finds Lingard at the back post, who sees his volley blocked by Ryan Tunnicliffe with the keeper beaten.</p>

<p>57 mins: Still a tight game  here. United moving the ball a little better since the break.</p>

<p>A totally one-siided affair.</p>

<p>The full-time whistle can't come soon enough for Hull as Yarmolenko grabs his second with a simple finish from Anderson's pull-back.</p>

<p>Back underway at Luton.</p>

<p>Haller takes the ball round the keeper and finishes after being played through by Lanzini.</p>

<p>Brentford are through!</p>

<p>Raya dives the right way to save Grady Diangana's effort, giving Christian Norgaard the chance to decide the shootout. He does so, finding the bottom corner.</p>

<p>Another pair of successful spot-kicks for both teams.</p>

<p>Both sides have scored their first two spot-kicks in the shootout.</p>

<p>Branislav Ivanovic, Ivan Toney Josh da Silva and Conor Gallagher all finding the net.</p>

<p>United lucky to be leading...</p>

<p>Another penalty for the Red Devils as George Moncur brings down Brandon Williams.</p>

<p>Stipe Perica gets a red on his second apperance for violent conduct against Brandon Cooper.</p>

<p>31 mins: Not the most impressive start from United. The short summer break could have something to do with that.</p>

<p>84 mins: Newport make two late changes. Lewis Collins and Robbie Willmott on for Scot Bennett and goalscorer Joss Labadie.</p>

<p>Yarmolenko makes it three from the penalty spot. Almost impossible to see any way back for the visitors.</p>

<p>78 mins: Gallagher misses a big chance to put the home side back in front, volleying over from close range.</p>

<p>23 mins: It's end-to-end stuff here. This time Fred's deflected strike from distance almost catches the keeper out but it's just wide.</p>

<p>Back underway at West Ham.</p>

<p>The Bees equalise again!</p>

<p>Robert Snodgrass scores against his former club and it's a lovely goal too.</p>

<p>A deserved lead.</p>

<p>An enforced change for Hull as George Honeyman comes on for an injured Richard Snmallwood.</p>

<p>5 mins: A couple of early chances for the Hammers as Fabian Balbuena and Felipe Anderson both see efforts go narrowly wide.</p>

<p>33 mins: Nearly a third for the home side as Padraig Amond's shhot goes just wide from the edge of the box.</p>
