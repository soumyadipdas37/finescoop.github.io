<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Valencia are reportedly weighing up a surprise loan move to sign Chelsea's forgotten man Danny Drinkwater.</p>

<p>The midfielder has not played a game for the Blues in the last two seasons and endured two miserable loan spells with Burnley and Aston Villa last season, playing just six times across both spells. </p>

<p>Now the LaLiga side want to rescue the Premier League winner from his Stamford Bridge nightmare and see him as a 'cheap' option to bolster former Watford boss Javi Gracia's squad, according to Radio Esport Valencia, via SportWitness.</p>

<p>Danny Drinkwater could be set for a shock loan move to Valencia, according to Spanish media </p>

<p>Valencia boss Javi Gracia is in need of cheap options after being forced to sell top midfielders</p>

<p>Valencia have been forced to cash in on a number of first team stars in this transfer window, with Rodrigo leaving for Leeds in a £35million move, while three midfielders have left in Dani Parejo, Francis Coquellin and Ferran Torres - who joined Man City for £27m.</p>

<p>The report claims Valencia are keen on a loan deal for Drinkwater as Chelsea would pay a portion of his salary, with no obligation to buy the player. </p>

<p>It adds that the Spanish outfit are yet to make an offer to the Blues, and are simply 'assessing' a potential deal as it stands.  </p>

<p>The midfielder failed to impress in claret and blue for either Burnley or Villa on loan last season</p>

<p>Chelsea have already loaned out Ross Barkley to Aston Villa and the club would likely be happy to get a chunk of Drinkwater's wages off the books for the meantime. </p>

<p>Drinkwater suffered a turbulent 2019-20 campaign as he attempted to resurrect his career out on loan with Burnley, but his time at the club was blighted by a incident where he was assaulted at a nightclub.</p>

<p>Controversy followed him to Villa as he was sent home after headbutting team-mate Jota during a training session.</p>

<p>He has suffered a fall from grace since winning the Premier League with Leicester in 2016</p>

<p>It has been a huge fall from grace for the 30-year-old, who was a crucial part of Leicester City's fairytale Premier League title triumph in 2016, with his impressive midfield displays soon earning him a £35m move to Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>He has played a total of 23 times for Chelsea, scoring just once and failing to reproduce his form from the King Power Stadium.</p>

<p>This month he admitted a need to 'clean myself up' after his year of bad publicity, which also included a charge for drink-driving in May 2019, and even said he would be open to moving to a foreign league.</p>

<p>Drinkwater hasn't played for Chelsea in the last two seasons and has featured 23 times in total</p>

<p>'I have taken a good look at myself loads of times,' he told the Telegraph. 'I told myself that I needed to clean myself up big time.</p>

<p>'I had a wake-up call after the drink-driving, another wake-up call after the nightclub and then another wake-up call after the incident at Villa. Then it's like, this has got to stop.</p>

<p>'I've got loads more to give. I'm open to going abroad, even though it will be difficult with my son,' Drinkwater explained.</p>

<p>'I need an anchor and I need to sort out one side of my life, so if I can sort my football out, even if it is abroad, then that will help in the long term.</p>
