<p>And there may be more channel-flipping to come, with the Australian Financial Review reporting that Seven is now 'eyeing up' Ninja Warrior.</p>

<p>Ninja Warrior has aired on Nine since 2017, but its ratings quickly plateaued after a blockbuster first season.</p>

<p>Seven unsuccessfully tried to rival Ninja Warrior in 2018 with its own sports entertainment format, Australian Spartan. </p>

<p>While it wasn't a ratings hit, it did succeed in stealing some of Ninja's audience.</p>

<p>The Financial Review, which is owned by Nine, quoted unnamed sources as saying that Seven was 'looking at bidding for' the Endemol Shine-produced show.</p>

<p>Rumours: The Australian Financial Review, which is owned by Nine, quoted unnamed sources as saying that Seven was 'looking at bidding for' the Endemol Shine-produced Ninja Warrior</p>

<p>Middling performance: Ninja Warrior has aired on Nine since 2017, but its ratings quickly plateaued after a blockbuster first season</p>

<p>Seven trumpeted its acquisition of The Voice over the weekend as a significant coup, but it didn't take long for Nine to respond with a brutal statement dismissing it as a loss-making franchise.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately due to the age of the show and declining demographic profile, The Voice had become by far the poorest financial performer on our slate. We wish Seven well in their quest to revive yet another Nine show,' a spokesperson said.</p>

<p>'We are very excited about the schedule we have now set for reinvigorating our slate and we will have announcements at our upfronts on September 16.</p>

<p>'We remain focused on our audience and the financial performance of Nine.'</p>

<p>Bomb: Seven tried to rival Ninja Warrior in 2018 with its own sports entertainment format, Australian Spartan. While it wasn't a hit, it did succeed in stealing some of Ninja's audience</p>

<p>On Saturday, it was confirmed that Nine had 'failed to renew the contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the deal 'very quickly'.</p>

<p>Sonia Kruger, who previously hosted the singing competition for Nine, will now front the 2021 series after jumping ship to Seven last year.</p>

<p>Seven's CEO, James Warburton, described the acquisition as 'a coup'. </p>

<p>War of words: Seven trumpeted its acquisition of The Voice over the weekend as a coup, but it didn't take long for Nine to respond with a brutal statement dismissing it as a loss-making franchise. Pictured: The Voice coaches Guy Sebastian (left) and Delta Goodrem (right)</p>

<p>This isn't the first Nine show Seven has revived this year, as last month it premiered its rebooted version of dating show Farmer Wants a Wife.</p>

<p>The program first aired on Nine in 2007, and ran for eight seasons before being cancelled. It was renewed in 2016, only to be axed again due to poor ratings.</p>

<p>But Seven's premiere proved to be a success, pulling in 908,000 metro viewers and an additional 492,000 regional viewers. </p>
