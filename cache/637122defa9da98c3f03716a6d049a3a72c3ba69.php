<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The cast of Gogglebox Australia have slammed Ellen DeGeneres' apology following allegations that her show harboured a toxic workplace.</p>

<p>Last month, the comedian kicked off the 18th season of her talk show by telling her audience she was 'taking responsibility' for the scandal while also squeezing in a few jokes.</p>

<p>But during Wednesday night's episode of Gogglebox, the cast lashed out at the 62-year-old for the 'awkward' comedic undertones in her monologue.</p>

<p>'She's obviously not really sorry!' Gogglebox stars have blasted Ellen DeGeneres' 'awkward' apology over her workplace bullying scandal on Wednesday</p>

<p>Millie Dalton explained: 'It undermines the meaning of the apology when you're just cracking jokes.' </p>

<p>'I feel awkward, I feel awkward watching it... I don't know if I buy it. Actions speak louder than words,' Chantal Bakac added.</p>

<p>Matty Fahd agreed: 'This is super awkward, knowing everyone is watching and hating you, then you have to get up there to apologise and you're obviously not really sorry.'</p>

<p>Matt Dalton also wasn't impressed by Ellen's apology and said: 'She's not addressing the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of workplace complaints about her being nasty. When not one but 300 people complain, maybe there's a smell there.' </p>

<p>Allegations: Over the last few months, multiple staffers from The Ellen DeGeneres Show stepped forward to accuse the 62-year-old and her senior executives of perpetuating a 'toxic work environment'</p>
