<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Made In Chelsea returned on Monday night with a pair of new faces - one of which was Charlie Frederick from Love Island 2018.</p>

<p>And while some fans were wondering where they recognised him from, others cottoned on straight away that he is an ex-Love Island star - the second to join Made In Chelsea recently.</p>

<p>Charlie appeared on series 4 of the ITV2 dating show, similarly to Zara McDermott who joined MIC as Sam Thompson's girlfriend last year.</p>

<p>The pair didn't cross paths during their time in the Spanish villa, with Charlie evicted 13 days into the series and Zara entering two days later.</p>

<p>MIC fans weren't sure about the choice in casting - with some finding it hilarious and others more than happy to see the hunky blonde on their screens again.</p>

<p>'Confused. Is this the same Charlie from #loveisland?' one typed on Twitter, followed by another who wrote: 'Omg is that charlie from love island?'</p>

<p>'Is this Made in Chelsea or Love Island?' another posted.</p>

<p>A fourth penned: 'They're going to have to start calling it Love In Chelsea soon!' </p>

<p>'Charlie from Love Island?!? lmao,' one viewer laughed, as did another who posted: 'Is the personal trainer from love island lmfao!'</p>

<p>Others merely rejoiced that the series was back on screens. </p>

<p>'Mondays are good again now that MIC is back!' one posted. Another penned: 'Made in Chelsea is back. Something proper to read on my twitter feed instead of all the #corona b******s!'</p>

<p>'Sorry but seeing liv wip out that voice note was something I needed to lighten up my Monday night!' someone else posted, referring to the way the episode ended.</p>

<p>It saw Liv Bentley inform Zara that her supposed friend Melissa Tattam had sent Tiff Watson a voice note calling Zara a 'fame w***e'.</p>

<p>The fallout of this will take place next week.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Charlie has been drafted in to spark up a romance with Liv, but seems to also have his eye on Verity Bowditch.</p>

<p>While he made an impression among the ladies of the show, Charlie didn't actually speak until 22 minutes into the episode.</p>

<p>Made In Chelsea airs Mondays at 9PM on E4.</p>
