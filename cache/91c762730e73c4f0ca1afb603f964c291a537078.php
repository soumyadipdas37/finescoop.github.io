<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The shamed boss of Rio Tinto could be paid more than £3,000 a day for another year despite being forced out over the destruction of sacred Aboriginal caves. </p>

<p>Jean-Sebastien Jacques, who has racked up more than £17m in pay and perks during his four years at the helm, was axed yesterday as the mining giant faced a mounting backlash over the scandal. </p>

<p>But he may not leave until March next year – and could stay on his £1.16m salary for another 12 months. </p>

<p>Out: Jean-Sebastien Jacques lost his job with the mining giant after protests over Juukan Gorge</p>

<p>And he could collect millions more in long-term bonuses from previous years which have not yet been paid out. </p>

<p>The French-born British citizen has faced a global backlash – including condemnation from Aboriginal elders and the Church of England, whose pension fund has a small stake in Rio – since the Anglo Australian mining giant blew up two ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia, in May. </p>

<p>The Juukan Gorge rock shelters, which date back around 46,000 years, were cleared away by Rio so it could dig up 8m tonnes of high-grade iron ore worth around £75m that lay beneath. </p>

<p>The FTSE100 firm has been desperately trying to repair its relations with aboriginal communities, shareholders and politicians – with Australia's parliament holding an inquiry into its actions. </p>

<p>This has included slashing payouts for executives, and docking Jacques' annual bonus, which was worth £1.7m last year. </p>

<p>But this has not proved enough to mollify its critics. Following a board meeting on Thursday, the miner announced yesterday that Jacques and two other executives – iron ore boss Chris Salisbury and corporate relations head Simone Niven – would step down.</p>

<p>In order to ensure a smooth transition, Jacques will stay on until March 31 next year or until a replacement is found – whichever is earlier. </p>

<p>Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson said: 'We have listened to our stakeholders' concerns that a lack of individual account ability undermines the group's ability to rebuild that trust and to move forward to implement the changes identified in the board review.' </p>

<p>Jacques, 48, who receives a basic salary of £1.16m, is contractually entitled to 12 months' notice. This means he could receive around just under £3,200 a day for another year, even when he is no longer working. Commentators, however, were more focused on the wider impact of their departure. </p>

<p>Mining industry expert Ben Cleary, a partner at Tribeca Investment Partners, said the clear-out at Rio could bring a halt to or slow down some major mining projects. </p>

<p>He said: 'For the chief executive and a couple of senior management to go over an ESG [environmental, social and governance] issue, it's just going to reverberate through board rooms throughout the sector.'</p>
