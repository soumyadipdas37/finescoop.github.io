<p>Shots from the set of Top Gear have shown the impressive-looking new format, amid social distancing regulations due to COVID-19</p>

<p>According to The Sun, production are filming five episodes over three nights and are considering keeping the format and making it an annual occasion.</p>

<p>160 cars were welcomed on site and the show featured segments such as a Wall Of Death sequence at Alexandra Palace and Freddie trying to drive to 200mph in a 1990s supercar.</p>

<p>It also features Paddy’s Lamborghini incident in the Yorkshire Dales.</p>

<p>The motoring show has become the first major entertainment series to return to TV with a live audience after the show was recorded using the 'drive-in' format.</p>

<p>Host Paddy called it: 'A 'Covid-compliant, socially distanced, classic drive-in show'.</p>

<p>According to The Guardian, the show adhered to safety measures including temperature checks and parking positions two metres apart.</p>

<p>A 500-strong audience is pictured watching from their socially-distanced parked cars</p>

<p>Wow: The episode was filmed at the show's race track in Dunsfold, Surrey, after the hosts were forced to leave the studio hangar because of the pandemic</p>

<p>Back in action: Top Gear has become the first major entertainment series to return to TV with a live audience</p>

<p>A marquee was set up for members of the production team who were partitioned into individual areas with plastic. </p>

<p>The publication reports that Paddy and fellow presenters Freddie and Chris have been regularly tested for the virus and have been served food in resealable bags.</p>

<p>Chris described the show's new look as a mixture between a low-rent rock festival meets a drive-in cinema from the 1960s.</p>

<p>He said the Top Gear team were 'blessed we’ve got the chance to do something with a live audience. The producers have come up with some really clever solutions to the problems.'</p>

<p>Event: The programme was taped in front of 500 fans who were all in their cars with presenter Paddy McGuinness calling it a 'Covid-compliant, socially distanced, classic drive-in show'</p>

<p>Paddy said: 'If coronavirus wasn’t a thing and the producers suggested filming it outside I’d be thinking that’s not a very good idea. </p>

<p>'But I think because people have been kind of cooped up at home they will be excited to be out and at a show surrounded by other people.'</p>

<p>It reportedly took around 150 people three days to create the drive-in and the BBC are so pleased with it, they are considering making it an annual event. </p>

<p>Top Gear resumed filming following the coronavirus pandemic in June when the presenters emerged from lockdown to reunite at Alton Towers Resort theme park in Staffordshire. </p>

<p>Distancing: The show was filmed at Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey and the audience adhered to safety measures including temperature checks and parking positions were two metres apart</p>

<p>While the park may have been closed to customers, Paddy, Chris and Freddie made the most of the empty resort and filmed an electric car race.</p>

<p>It was reported during the summer that Top Gear will use 'strictly limited' crews and adhere to government guidelines when it resumes filming, according to the BBC's Charlotte Moore. </p>

<p>Ms Moore wrote in The Telegraph: 'We will work within Government guidelines. Crews will be strictly limited. Cast members will do their own hair and make-up. Social distancing will be in place.' </p>

<p>It's back! Top Gear resumed filming in June after the coronavirus pandemic halted the latest series of the hit BBC car show</p>
