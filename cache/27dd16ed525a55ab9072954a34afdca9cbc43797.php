<p>According to police, they'd had an argument about not having enough sex.  He then opened fire on neighbors Canisha and Makayla Saulter, who were loading up a U-Haul van with other members of their family. </p>

<p>Makayla, 12, was holding 29-year-old Canisha's 18-month-old daughter at the time. </p>

<p>She shielded the girl from the gunfire but was shot in the head and is now in the hospital in a critical condition. </p>

<p>Canisha was shot multiple times from the waist down. She is in the hospital in a serious but stable condition. The other members of their family drove them to the hospital and called police on Mesich.</p>

<p>When authorities arrived, they engaged in a standoff with the man. He fired 40 shots before being arrested.</p>

<p>When he got back, he said his wife hit him. He punched her in the collar bone, he said, then she 'told him' to shoot her so he did. </p>

<p>He told police he 'emptied' the gun. </p>

<p>When asked why he'd shot the girls next door, he said he 'hates all children' and that they 'weren't good neighbors'. </p>

<p>The Saulter family say 12-year-old Makayla is a 'hero' for protecting her niece, Winter, from the hail of bullets. </p>

<p>Her family is now raising money for her medical care on GoFundMe page found here. They have raised $46,000 of their $50,000 target.  </p>

<p>In the description, they say: 'She was shot somewhere in the back of the head. During a CT Scan they found her skull had been fractured, and have removed a piece of her skull to allow room for it to swell. </p>

<p>'She is currently on a respirator, with a tube near her forehead to allow the blood to drain. </p>

<p>'It is unknown how long she will be in the hospital or if she will ever fully recover. The doctors predict she will have a long road to recovery. </p>

<p>'She will be in the hospital for at least 2-3 months with the piece of her skull removed, then even longer once it is put back in place, then she will be going to Gillette Children's Hospital after that.'  </p>

<p>Mesich is in custody on murder and attempted murder charges.  </p>
