<p>The 45-year-old, formerly known as Kate Fischer, was listed for mention in a matter involving police, which was adjourned to the same court next week.</p>

<p>However, court documents have listed the former actress under her birth name of Katherine Fischer.</p>

<p>The former model wore a simple black dress with an asymmetrical hem, a white jacket and a pair of black and white sneakers as she arrived at Sydney's Downing Centre. </p>

<p>She tied her caramel-hued locks in a high bun and had a black bag slung over her shoulder.</p>

<p>Legal: The 45-year-old, formerly known as Kate Fischer, was listed for mention in a matter involving police, which was adjourned to the same court next week</p>

<p>Style: She tied her hair in a high bun and had a black bag slung over her shoulder</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in July it was revealed a bizarre love triangle involving Tziporah and two ex-partners - one a former policeman and the other a female jailbird - is set to play out before the courts. </p>

<p>Last year the 46-year-old was pictured holding hands with Victoria Rupp at Sydney's Bondi Beach.</p>

<p>But after their relationship fizzled, Tziporah began dating former cop Nicholas Patsidis, 40, also a one-time lover of Rupp's.</p>

<p>Accessories: She tied her hair in a high bun and held a black bag on her shoulder </p>

<p>Now the trio are also connected by a pair of AVOs. </p>

<p>Police took out one of the orders to protect Malkah from Patsidis after he was charged with assaulting her.</p>

<p>The other AVO is in place to protect Patsidis from Rupp after she was accused of bombarding the ex-cop with abusive text messages following their split.  </p>

<p>Tziporah will appear at Downing Centre Local Court again on September 25. </p>

<p>More to come: Tziporah will appear at Downing Centre Local Court again on September 25</p>
