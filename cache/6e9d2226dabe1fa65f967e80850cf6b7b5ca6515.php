<p>The £40million striker returns to Spurs on Sunday - the scene of his first Premier League goal - but he has scored just once in the top-flight in the 13 months since that 1-0 victory.</p>

<p>Bruce, though, insists he will not give up on the Brazilian, who netted twice during Wednesday's 7-0 win at League Two Morecambe in the EFL Cup.</p>

<p>Steve Bruce says he never considered getting rid of Newcastle's record-signing Joelinton</p>

<p>The £40million striker returns to Spurs on Sunday - the scene of his first Premier League goal</p>

<p>'There was no temptation whatsoever to let him go,' he said.</p>

<p>'We saw with the second goal at Morecambe (top corner from 20 yards), it gives you a clue to his ability. We see it - or I see it - on the training ground.</p>

<p>'The thing he has to come to terms with is adapting to the Premier League, and he has struggled with that, like a lot of great players.</p>

<p>'I think Joe will benefit from the fact he understands what is coming more now. He still has improvement in him. I had no intention of letting Joe go anywhere, we have to keep working with him.</p>

<p>Bruce, though, insists he will not give up on the Brazilian, who netted twice on Wednesday</p>

<p>'He will certainly get a little bit of confidence from scoring a couple the other night. Because, when you're constantly kicked, sometimes it can bash away at you, and no-one is immune to that. We will keep supporting him. We have to find it and get the best out of him.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bruce said he could not comment on Sportsmail's revelation this week that two of his senior medical staff have been stood down pending an internal investigation.</p>

<p>First-team physio Michael Harding and masseur Wayne Farrage have agreed not to work while the club's process is ongoing.</p>
