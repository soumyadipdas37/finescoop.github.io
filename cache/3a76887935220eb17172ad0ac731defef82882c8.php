<p>Toned: Dua revealed her taut abs in a quirky black cropped jacket paired with leather look trousers as she strolled</p>

<p>Love: Her raven tresses were pulled back from her face with the couple taking precautions against COVID-19 with face masks</p>

<p>The outing comes days after Anwar became an uncle, following news his sister Gigi had given birth to a baby girl with boyfriend Zayn Malik.</p>

<p>It was reported last month that Dua has upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar.</p>

<p>The Sun reported The One Kiss hitmaker has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Close: The pair looked as loved-up as ever as they strolled in the Big Apple</p>

<p>Touch: Dua lovingly stroked Anwar's face as they chatted in the street</p>

<p>Rock on: Anwar wore an Iron Maiden tee and baggy trousers as he enjoyed the day</p>

<p>It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK. </p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end.</p>

<p>'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic.</p>

<p>'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time. </p>
