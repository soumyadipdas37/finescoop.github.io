<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's Olympic and Paralympic sports have been warned that their funding could be stripped if they do not properly protect the welfare of their athletes.</p>

<p>A Sportsmail investigation on Monday found that UK Sport had not taken money away from any governing bodies on the grounds of athlete welfare in the past two Olympic cycles despite a string of scandals.</p>

<p>However, UK Sport chief executive Sally Munday has now revealed she would not 'shy away' from taking that hardline approach, as she looks to restore the reputation of an elite sport system which has been further hit by the recent abuse allegations in British Gymnastics.</p>

<p>Sally Munday has warned UK Sport will cut funding if the welfare of athletes is not protected</p>

<p>Munday, who replaced Liz Nicholl as CEO last year, said: 'We do have the ultimate power of taking money away and we will take money away if we think that needs to happen. We won't shy away if we feel that is the requirement.</p>

<p>'The important thing is how can we help sports to learn and improve. But we will put conditions into funding awards where it is required, and they will have to meet those conditions. We will remove funding if we need to.'</p>

<p>Munday was speaking at an event to update on the work UK Sport are doing to improve the culture within a system which has been criticised for chasing Olympic and Paralympic medals at all costs.</p>

<p>The reputation of British Gymnastics has been tarnished by recent allegations of abuse</p>

<p>She announced the creation of 200 culture champions and 300 mental health champions, and released results from UK Sport's latest Culture Health Check, a survey which was first launched in 2017 after an independent investigation found there to be a 'culture of fear' at British Cycling.</p>

<p>Athlete welfare has come under the spotlight again in recent weeks amid the abuse scandal in gymnastics, which is now also the subject of an independent review.</p>

<p>And Munday, who was previously CEO of GB Hockey, added: 'We are really disappointed by the stories that have emerged in gymnastics. Such behaviour has got no place at any level of the sport we fund.</p>

<p>Cyclist Callum Skinner, pictured at the Rio games, quit Great Britain action over welfare issues</p>

<p>'I cannot stress enough that the desire to succeed in Games must never ever come at any cost. It is possible to be successful whilst embracing a culture that puts athletes' welfare and wellbeing at its very core. I strongly reject that it is an either/or.</p>

<p>'For anyone who doesn't want to adhere to the highest standards of ethics and integrity, my message is clear: you are not welcome in Olympic and Paralympic sport.'</p>

<p>Results released from this year's Culture Health Check show that 10 per cent of athletes and staff have experienced or witnessed unacceptable behaviour, although that is down from 24 per cent in 2018.</p>

<p>Of those surveyed, only 53 per cent said they felt there are consequences when people behave inappropriately.</p>

<p>Dame Katherine Grainger says abuse reports have left her feeling 'deep sadness and anger'</p>

<p>Dame Katherine Grainger, the London 2012 rowing gold medallist and now UK Sport chair, said: 'All of us are acutely aware of situations involving inappropriate behaviour that has come to light in the recent months. I have read the reports with a mix of disappointment, disbelief, deep, deep sadness and anger.</p>

<p>'While UK Sport is a leadership body not a governing body, we do fully accept the role we all must play in ensuring that bullying or abusive behaviour is identified, confronted and eradicated.</p>

<p>'I am really clear that anyone working in high-performance sport with us must be committed to the very highest standards of ethics. There is no room for anyone who doesn't want to live up to those high standards.'</p>

<p>A group of former British gymnasts, including ex-Olympians, are considering taking legal action against British Gymnastics.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the group's legal team told ITV News: 'In just a week we've had over 20 people join discussions about a potential group action against British Gymnastics, including four Olympians, with the number rising day by day.'</p>
