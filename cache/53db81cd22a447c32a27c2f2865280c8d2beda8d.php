<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They've been close pals since working together on Byker Grove in the 1990s.</p>

<p>And Ant McPartlin, 44, showed he was every inch the proud uncle as he doted on Declan Donnelly's two-year-old daughter during a candid radio chat on Monday.</p>

<p>During the interview, Dec also sweetly revealed that little Isla calls him 'Dec Dec' after his wife Ali Astall, 42, taught the youngster to say 'daddy Dec'. </p>

<p>Close pals: Ant McPartlin showed he was every inch the proud uncle as he doted on Declan Donnelly's two-year-old daughter Isla during a candid radio chat on Monday</p>

<p>Chatting on Steve and Karen's Breakfast Show on TFM, the duo discussed Dec's daughter and how Ant gets stuck in with the fun when he visits.</p>

<p>Ant said: 'I haven't done a nappy. I was round yours the other day. We were doing a lot of playing in the garden – she's absolutely beautiful.'</p>

<p>Also during the show, Dec revealed his little girl had started speaking and had recently learned how to say his name.</p>

<p>'She has just turned two a couple of weeks ago, running around and talking – we are getting words out of her,' he said.</p>

<p>Oh baby! Dec announced his and Ali's little girl Isla had been born on Instagram, saying he was already 'head over heels' for his daughter</p>

<p>The proud dad then revealed: 'My wife has taught her to say daddy Dec, she just shouts Dec, Dec.'</p>

<p>However the doting father added that he's not been a fan of changing little Isla's nappies, joking that it's 'a whole new world'.</p>

<p>He said: 'I take her near Ali and say "I think she's done a poo, you better go and check", but you do everything it takes to avoid doing a nappy.'</p>

<p>Ant, who was taking a hiatus from presenting at the time after a stint in rehab, was one of the first people to visit baby Isla after she was born in September 2018.</p>

<p>Congratulations: Ant was quick to congratulate Dec after Isla was born in September 2018  </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Ant couldn’t wait to see Dec and Ali – and baby Isla of course. It’s a dream come true for them all and everyone is completely besotted.'</p>

<p>The star also congratulated his friend, tweeting: 'Welcome to the world, baby Isla Elizabeth Anne. Can’t wait for cuddles. I love you already! Uncle Ant xxxxx’.</p>

<p>Since then Dec, Ali and Isla have often been seen with Ant and his girlfriend Anne-Marie Corbett. He was previously married to Lisa Armstrong but announced they had split in January 2018.</p>

<p>Fabulous duo: Since appearing together on Byker Grove in the 1990s Ant and Dec have gone on to become TV favourites with presenting gigs on I'm A Celeb and Britain's Got Talent</p>

<p>It comes after Dec and his co-host Ant were back on screens on Saturday night for the semi-finals of Britain's Got Talent. </p>

<p>The beloved presenting duo hit the right notes as they entertained viewers with a rat pack-influenced intro, which was most definitely a step up from their PJ and Duncan days. </p>

<p>Singing and dancing their way through the show's opening, Ant and Dec were dressed to impress in sleek suits while introducing the talent show's return following the coronavirus lockdown.  </p>

<p>The series gave fans a sneak peek of the show's new socially-distanced judging panel ahead of the first semi-final on Saturday.</p>

<p>The new setup sees each judge placed on their own desks at least two metres apart to ensure the show is adhering to new safety guidelines during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>For the pre-recorded semis, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon, David Walliams and new judge Ashley Banjo will be seated separately to adhere with strict new guidelines, with the shows also featuring a virtual audience watching from home.</p>

<p>Amanda has also been promoted to head judge, and joked she'd be backing 'musical theatre all the way,' if she had to make a deciding vote.</p>

<p>Simon Cowell, 60, was forced to pull out of BGT after breaking his back during a shock cycling accident, and has been replaced by Diversity star Ashley Banjo. </p>

<p>Smooth moves: BGT winner Ashley Banjo is filling in for head judge Simon Cowell, who is currently recovering from a freak bike accident in Los Angeles</p>
