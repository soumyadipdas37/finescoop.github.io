<p>Shocking dash cam footage shows the crash, which happened on Roedean Road in Brighton, Sussex.</p>

<p>The driver, who had to undergo an amputation and wished to remain anonymous, gave permission for the video to be released as part of a police crackdown on dangerous driving.</p>

<p>Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne described the footage as 'a shocking display of the consequences of dangerous driving'.</p>

<p>A driver who was texting at the wheel crashes into street signs and flips over his car into oncoming traffic on Roedean Road, Brighton</p>

<p>In the video, a cream Mini drives forward on a single carriageway in the rain as the texting driver approaches in a silver people-carrier.</p>

<p>The people-carrier is driving down the middle of the road and smashes into signs on an island at a junction at speed.</p>

<p>It flips onto its side onto the lane of oncoming traffic, skidding forward and twisting around.</p>

<p>The mini driver narrowly avoids the upturned car, turning into the path on the side of the road and stopping as debris from the crash lies on both lanes.</p>

<p>The people carrier flipped onto its side and span across the lane of oncoming traffic forcing a cream mini to narrowly avoid it</p>

<p>Police released the video of the crash, which happened on 15 November last year, to raise awareness of the 'fatal five' offences: speeding, drink and drug-driving, mobile phone use, not wearing a seatbelt, and careless and inconsiderate driving.</p>

<p>It follows a week of action during which hundreds of offences were detected on the roads in Sussex.</p>

<p>Assistant Chief Constable Dave Miller said: 'While we don't wish to shock and scare people with this footage, it's important that road users understand the serious consequences of the 'fatal five' offences.</p>

<p>'By taking personal responsibility and driving safely and sensibly, you can help us reduce the number of people killed and seriously injured in Sussex and Surrey.'</p>

<p>Sussex Police and Crime Commissioner Katy Bourne said: 'The video being shared by Sussex Police is a shocking display of the consequences of dangerous driving and I am grateful to those that have agreed to share this.</p>

<p>'It really enforces the fact that we all use the roads and must share the responsibility of ensuring the safety of ourselves and others.</p>

<p>'Road safety will continue to be a top priority for Sussex Police because it matters to local residents. </p>

<p>'The sobering message from this video is not to drive irresponsibly because the consequences can be dangerous and life-changing.'</p>

<p>Last year in Sussex, 39 people were killed in vehicle collisions. Across the UK, there were 1,870 road deaths in the year ending June 2019.</p>
