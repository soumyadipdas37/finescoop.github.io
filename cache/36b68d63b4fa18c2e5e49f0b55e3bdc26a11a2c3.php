<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If it was Australia's fast bowlers who shone during last summer's Ashes draw, it was their spinners who stood out at the start of their white-ball coronavirus tour.</p>

<p>On an evening when England versus Australia entered the unprecedented territory of behind-closed-doors cricket, the tourists' unheralded slow-bowling trio of Glenn Maxwell, Ashton Agar and Adam Zampa - off-spinner, left-armer and leggie - slowed England's progress after Jos Buttler had threatened one of his specials.</p>

<p>Dawid Malan regained some of the momentum with an increasingly fluent innings of 66 off 43 balls - his eighth score of 50 or more in 14 T20 international knocks. But when he flat-batted Kane Richardson to Steve Smith at long-off, England were 147 for seven with only 11 deliveries to go. They had to settle for a middling 162.</p>

<p>Dawid Malan crashed 66 runs for England as they set Australia a target of 163 to win first T20</p>

<p>At 64 for one in the eighth over, with Buttler in beautiful nick at the venue where he recently made a Test-best 152 against Pakistan, England were on course for a daunting total after being invited to bat in the first of three T20 internationals here in five days.</p>

<p>He had already taken 16 off Agar's first over, the second of the innings, twice forcing Australian fielders to search for the ball among the Ageas Bowl's ring of seats.</p>

<p>But when Agar returned for his second, Buttler pulled him straight to Pat Cummins at deep midwicket to depart for 44 off 29 balls. It was a huge moment, and Australia knew it, celebrating with the kind of gusto more usually reserved for a packed house at the MCG. It said much for Buttler's increasingly first-rate summer that his innings almost qualified as a disappointment.</p>

<p>The effect of his demise was visible on both teams. Tom Banton, given a chance at No 4 â€“ and preferred in the line-up to Sam Billings - reverse-swept his second ball, from Zampa, for four. But he soon skewed Agar high into the covers, where Australia's captain Aaron Finch nearly pulled a hamstring running and reaching for an excellent catch over his shoulder.</p>

<p>And it was 91 for four when the in-form Eoin Morgan lifted the combative Maxwell down the ground, where Smith ran round from long-on to hold another smart catch.</p>

<p>That was part of a near-faultless display from Australia in the field - an impressive effort given this was their first game of any kind since a one-day international against New Zealand at Sydney on March 13, two days after the World Health Organisation declared a global pandemic.</p>

<p>Maxwell struck again when Moeen Ali - who ended his horror run by hitting Pakistan for 61 off 33 balls in Manchester on Tuesday - made a hash of a reverse sweep and was out for two.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Zampa had bowled two overs for just 12, matching a career economy-rate that has helped the Australians to the top of the world rankings. Perhaps Finch's only misstep in the field was to give his leg-spinner one more over when Maxwell had two for 14 with an over to go: Malan butchered it for 22.</p>

<p>Tom Curran, chosen ahead of his brother Sam, had already come and gone for six, and it was left to Chris Jordan, who helped take 10 off Cummins's final over, to lift England to a score they had any hope of defending.</p>

<p>Earlier, it was perhaps inevitable that the first sign of rust would come from an Australian: Mitchell Starc's first ball of the match was a big off-side wide. And England's opening partnership was worth 43 inside four overs when Bairstow prodded a cross-seam delivery from Cummins to short third man for eight.</p>

<p>It's been a curious summer for Bairstow, who pulverised Ireland to the tune of 82 in 41 balls in the second of three one-day internationals in early August, but has otherwise made five single-figure scores in six innings.</p>

<p>Another half-hour of Buttler, and Australian heads would have dropped. But Agar's alliance with Zampa has been central to their recent success, and Maxwell provided a handy third prong.</p>

<p>On a more sombre note, England's players wore black armbands for David Capel, the former Northamptonshire all-rounder who died this week at the age of 57.</p>
