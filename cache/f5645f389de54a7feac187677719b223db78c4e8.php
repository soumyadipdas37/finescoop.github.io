<p>The Porsche driver waited at the light for 10 seconds before attempting to cross a main road in Lane Cove in Sydney's Lower North Shore on at 7:17pm last Friday. </p>

<p>A Porsche Cayenne (left) that ran a red light was T-boned by a black car (centre) in Lane Cove in Sydney's Lower North Shore on at 7:17pm on September 18</p>

<p>Footage of the crash was then posted to the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page on Wednesday. </p>

<p>'You know it's a red light. You stopped for 10 seconds and decided to move on under a red. I am confused,' the witness driver said in the caption. </p>

<p>Facebook users speculated that the Porsche driver intentionally caused the crash for an insurance scam.</p>

<p>'Porsche driver probably trying to write off his car to get a pay out for these covid 19 times,' one person wrote. </p>

<p>'Doesn't move when it is clear and only drives through intersection when cars are coming. So I'm thinking insurance job.'  </p>

<p>'Looks to be a staged accident for a fraudulent insurance claim,' another user agreed.'</p>

<p>The hood of the oncoming car was smashed and smoke could be seen coming from both vehicles involved after the crash. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, other cars slowed down and overtook the crash in the left lane. </p>
