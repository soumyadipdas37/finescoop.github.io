<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Seven crew members on board a ship anchored off Western Australia's northwest coast have tested positive to Covid-19.</p>

<p>The cases follow those of two men taken off the bulk carrier on Friday, which has been anchored nine nautical miles off Port Hedland since September 16.</p>

<p>In total, 20 Filipino nationals and the captain were on board the Patricia Oldendorff and it is expected more may yet test positive.</p>

<p>The seven new cases have to remain on board as they are part of a skeleton crew of nine to keep it operational.</p>

<p>WA Health Minister Roger Cook said on Saturday their symptoms were minor or non-existent and would be monitored.</p>

<p>However, he warned there was a risk of a massive new outbreak if the ship was not contained, as cases numbers were expected to grow.Â </p>

<p>'If it gets out into the community it will create a disaster, worse than what we've seen in Melbourne,' he said.</p>

<p>The evacuated crew members, including the two positive cases identified on Friday, are in hotel quarantine in Port Hedland.</p>

<p>Mr Cook said 'every safety measure is being put in place' so the local community should not be concerned.</p>

<p>'These crew do not currently need medical treatment but should it be required, every precaution is in place to protect healthcare workers and members of the public,' he said.</p>

<p>Private security guards are being used in hotel quarantine in Port Hedland, as in Perth, which prompted questions in light of the failures of private security in Victoria.</p>

<p>Mr Cook told reporters there was a 'world of difference' between WA and Victoria.</p>

<p>'All our security guards are trained in infection control otherwise they cannot be on site,' he said.</p>

<p>'We have our own people on the sites making sure that they can supervise the security guards.'</p>

<p>It is expected the two skeleton crew who have tested negative for the virus may well contract it in due course or have already had it, so serology tests are being done.</p>

<p>Arrangements are being made for a replacement skeleton crew to be available to allow for a deep clean of the ship.</p>

<p>A rapid response team is being led by experienced doctor Tudor Codreanu, who also managed COVID-19 outbreaks on board the Artania cruise liner and Al-Kuwait livestock ship earlier this year.</p>

<p>The ship left the Philippines on September 5 with a fresh crew, indicating the virus came from that country, Mr Cook said.</p>

<p>The seven new cases have not been attributed to WA's Saturday case-count but will be included in Sunday's numbers.</p>

<p>One case was recorded in WA on Saturday - an Australian traveller in hotel quarantine.</p>
