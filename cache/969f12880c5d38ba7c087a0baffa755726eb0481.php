<p>A man has been killed after he was run over repeatedly in a supermarket car park as police launch a murder investigation</p>

<p>Some locals said a burnt out BMW was found nearby, but police have not confirmed if this was involved in the killing.</p>

<p>Police launched a murder inquiry and say no arrests have yet been made.</p>

<p>A shop worker who was about to leave after a night shift saw paramedics working on the stricken man.</p>

<p>Shahid Khattack, store manager at the nearby Iceland that backs on to the scene, saw the victim lying in the car park after the attack.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old said: 'I was about to come out of the shop out the back when I saw the paramedics and emergency services.</p>

<p>'They were still working on him, pumping his chest, doing CPR, trying to save him. It was a shocking thing to see.</p>

<p>'We have a lot of trouble and threats from shoplifters, but you don't expect to see that.' </p>

<p>Mr Khattack added: 'People I've spoken to who saw it said he was run over about four or five times.'</p>

<p>The 47-year-old victim was pronounced dead at the scene in Dagenham, east London, after being hit five times by a car at around 11.30pm on Sunday night</p>

<p>Mr Khattack said he saw two ambulances and around two police cars.</p>

<p>He added: 'Some people said they even saw armed police. It was crazy and all very scary.</p>

<p>'We weren't allowed to out the building until 2am while the car park was closed off. My shift was supposed to start again at 4am.'</p>

<p>The supermarket was still not allowed to open this afternoon, as forensic teams cordoned off the car park and took pictures of the area.</p>

<p>Another resident who did not want to be named said he heard a man groaning on the floor then looked out his window and saw the car run him over, then reverse over the victim.</p>

<p>The man in his 20s said: 'I heard something that sounded like someone groaning. I kept hearing it so went to the window and saw him lying, groaning on the ground.</p>

<p>'Then I saw a car come in and run over him. At first I was so shocked I couldn't tell what really happened, then it reversed and went "bang" straight over him again.</p>

<p>'I was so shocked I couldn't believe it. I was like "did I actually just see that?" I told my mum and she called the police. It was so crazy.'</p>

<p>Albert Allen said he also heard a man cry out in pain then saw a car speeding down a nearby road in reverse.</p>

<p>The 92-year-old said: 'At about quarter to 10pm I heard something, it was like a man repeatedly screaming out.</p>

<p>'At first I didn't think anything of it as there's often noises out there from youngsters at that time of night.</p>

<p>'Then at about 10pm, a car sped down the road in reverse, it came flying down really fast.'  </p>

<p>Enquiries to find his next of kin are still ongoing, Scotland Yard said, and a post-mortem examination is due be carried out. </p>

<p>Detective Chief Inspector Mark Wrigley said: 'We believe the victim was deliberately harmed and we are treating this incident as a murder inquiry.</p>

<p>'We need to hear from anyone who was in the area at the time and saw anything suspicious.'</p>
