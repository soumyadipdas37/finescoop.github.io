<p>Due date: The former bomb disposal expert revealed in the caption just what the couple have been up to as they await the big day</p>

<p>New: Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World - a memoir about finding courage at work and in her personal life. Pictured with Andi Peters</p>

<p>The star also discussed struggling to open up to people after working as an explosive ordnance disposal specialist in Afghanistan and Cambodia.</p>

<p>She said: 'The biggest part of it is about the work I did with the [charity] Halo Trust. </p>

<p>'Before Love Island that was the work I liked doing and I was lucky enough to travel to Afghanistan and Cambodia, and during that time I learned a huge amount. </p>

<p>Something for herself: Camilla was approached to go on Love Island at a time when she said she was 'struggling' after returning  from Afghanistan </p>

<p>'As I travelled across several different countries, it changed in different places, but the work was majority in landmine clearance.</p>

<p>'You might clear land that can then be used for people to farm land for food for their family. Every country had different challenges, but it was an amazing experience.'</p>

<p>Camilla has written a book called Not The Type: Finding My Place in the Real World </p>

<p>The memoir is not just about finding the courage to go out and deal with lethal threats at work, but the courage to confront one's own fears and anxieties.</p>
