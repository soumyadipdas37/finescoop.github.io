<p>Bundle of joy: Chloe Lewis has revealed her 11-month-old son Beau has to wear a helmet for 23 hours a day because he has a misshapen head</p>

<p>She penned: 'I wanted to do a little post to share Beau's journey with you all &amp; raise awareness for other babies. </p>

<p>'When Beau was born he suffered a dishaped head due to a traumatic birth &amp; then for months after he would sleep on the flatter side as it was more comfortable for him. We used the shaping pillow but in Beau's case it didn't do much for him.'</p>

<p>Explaining how she searched for advice she added: 'I then came across the loviest girl Ria &amp; her beautiful boy Rudi who had the same thing. So I decided to message her randomly through Instagram. </p>

<p>Motherhood: New mum Chloe welcomed son Beau with partner Danny Flasher in October last year</p>

<p>Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually as a result of them spending a lot of time lying on their back.</p>

<p>These problems are quite common, affecting around 1 in every 5 babies at some point.</p>

<p>There are specially designed helmets and headbands that some people claim can help improve the shape of a baby's skull as they grow. </p>

<p>It comes after Chloe recently spoke about her pregnancy in a Q&amp;A and said she gained 1.5 stone in weight while expecting her first baby.</p>

<p>The reality TV star admitted she was 'surprised' at her low weight gain and also shared she fell pregnant just a month into her family planning journey. </p>

<p>She told followers: 'I weighed myself towards the end, I was about 1 1/2 stone heavier. I really thought I was going to blow up pregnant but really surprised myself.' </p>

<p>When asked whether she planned to start a family, the media personality said she 'felt the time was right' as she was content in her relationship with Danny.</p>

<p>'Yes we planned &amp; fell the first month but everyone is different. I don't know if you ever feel the time is right,' she said.</p>

<p>'I just was very happy in my relationship &amp; knew it was right &amp; I've always wanted to be a mumma. Plus I had lots of practise with my sisters babies, the only difference is I got to give them back.' [sic] </p>
