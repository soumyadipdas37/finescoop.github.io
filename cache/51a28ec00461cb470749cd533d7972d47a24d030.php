<p>Dr Ciara Duffy, from the Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research and The University of Western Australia, used venom from 312 honeybees for her study on cancer cells.</p>

<p>The bees - from Perth, Ireland and England - had their venom tested on aggressive cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer, which has few treatment options.</p>

<p>The research, released in the NJP Nature Precision Oncology journal, showed that the venom destroyed these cells.</p>

<p>Dr Ciara Duffy (pictured) used venom from 312 honeybees and bumblebees for her research</p>

<p>Dr Duffy said one specific concentration of the venom and kill cancer cells completely, while melittin can destroy the cells in just one hour. </p>

<p>Melittin, which produces the pain in honeybee venom, was also found to reduce the chemical messages of cancer cells essential to growth and division in just 20 minutes.  </p>

<p>Dr Duffy said no one has tested the impact of venom on cancer cells compared to normal cells before.         </p>

<p>'We tested a very small, positively charged peptide in honeybee venom called melittin, which we could reproduce synthetically, and found that the synthetic product mirrored the majority of the anti-cancer effects of honeybee venom,' Dr Duffy said.</p>

<p>'We found both honeybee venom and melittin significantly, selectively and rapidly reduced the viability of triple-negative breast cancer and HER2-enriched breast cancer cells.</p>

<p>'The venom was extremely potent.' </p>

<p>Professor Peter Klinken, Western Australia's chief scientist, said it was an exciting observation.</p>

<p>Dr Duffy also tested if melittin could be used with existing chemotherapy, and found it could work with chemotherapy used to treat aggressive breast cancer. </p>

<p>She revealed how she became involved in the research. </p>

<p>'I began with collecting Perth honeybee venom. Perth bees are some of the healthiest in the world,' she said.</p>

<p>'The bees were put to sleep with carbon dioxide and kept on ice before the venom barb was pulled out from the abdomen of the bee and the venom extracted by careful dissection.</p>

<p>There are 20,000 species of bees in the world but she wanted to compare the venom of the three countries. </p>

<p>'I found that the European honeybee in Australia, Ireland and England produced almost identical effects in breast cancer compared to normal cells. However, bumblebee venom was unable to induce cell death even at very high concentrations,' she said.  </p>
