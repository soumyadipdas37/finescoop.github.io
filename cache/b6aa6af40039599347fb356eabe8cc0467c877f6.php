<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If any side is looking to strike fear into their rivals this summer it would be Chelsea.  </p>

<p>Frank Lampard has been backed to the tune of at least £231million with owner Roman Abramovich signing off eye-catching deals for Timo Werner, Kai Havertz, Hakim Ziyech and Ben Chilwell ahead of the new season, with Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr shrewd additions on free transfers. </p>

<p>The west London club have been swift in finalising deals for their top targets, swelling the squad as they look to close the gap on champions Liverpool and Manchester City.  </p>

<p>Frank Lampard is looking to turn Chelsea back into title contenders after some fine business</p>

<p>Chelsea raided the Bundesliga for Timo Werner (left) and young starlet Kai Havertz (right)</p>

<p>But as exciting and impressive as the incomings have been, Lampard will be well aware that his job is now all about clearing the deadwood that is cluttering the dressing room. </p>

<p>The Blues have a number of players who have no future at Stamford Bridge and yet with many under contract through until 2022, the onus is on the club to find them a landing spot to get them off the wage bill. </p>

<p>From Michy Batshuayi to Marco van Ginkel, Sportsmail looks at the players Lampard will be actively looking to shift before the close of the window.  </p>

<p>Under contract until June 2021 </p>

<p>Wage - £90,000-a-week </p>

<p>One of the better performers in his time at the club among this list of players the club need to shift.  </p>

<p>Chelsea's wage bill for the year ending June 30, 2019, was £285.6m, fourth in the Premier League and representing 63.9 per cent of the club's turnover, according to the Athletic.</p>

<p>Batshuayi, who scored six times last season, is reported to be earning in the region of £90,000-a-week and so that is a clear incentive in moving the Belgian on, particularly with his minutes likely reduced further by the arrival of Werner and Havertz.  </p>

<p>Michy Batshuayi got game time last season but Werner's arrival pushes him down the order</p>

<p>Loans at Crystal Palace, Valencia and Borussia Dortmund have kept him busy in recent seasons - and now he looks set for another temporary move this summer.  </p>

<p>Chelsea are looking to get Batshuayi on a new contract before sending him out on another loan to Palace, securing their asset from leaving for nothing. </p>

<p>But with Werner, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud ahead of him, it may be time for him to cut his losses in west London. </p>

<p>Under contract until June 2021</p>

<p>Wage - £28,000-a-week </p>

<p>Amazingly Van Ginkel remains under contract at Stamford Bridge, seven years after joining from Vitesse in 2013. </p>

<p>He was set to leave for nothing this summer having become the club's forgotten man but instead he stunned supporters by agreeing a new one-year deal in June. </p>

<p>Van Ginkel has spent more time away from the club than at it since putting pen-to-paper seven years ago and so extending his deal caused great confusion. </p>

<p>He played four games on his arrival but a cruciate ligament injury put paid to his run in the side and, in truth, he has never recovered from that setback.  </p>

<p>Loan spells at AC Milan, Stoke City and PSV have followed and in between a number of injuries Van Ginkel's career at Chelsea feels like a case of 'what might have been'.  Little in the 27-year-old's portfolio suggests the club will be able to locate a buyer for him but despite disappearing into the loan market wilderness, stranger things have happened. </p>

<p>Marco van Ginkel played four games for Chelsea but a cruciate ligament injury sidelined him</p>

<p>Under contract until June 2021 </p>

<p>Wage - £75,000-a-week </p>

<p>Much like Batshuayi, it has not all been doom and gloom in a Chelsea shirt for Victor Moses. </p>

<p>Under Antonio Conte, who brought him to Inter Milan last season on loan, Moses played a key role for Chelsea down the right side in the 2016-17 title-winning campaign. </p>

<p>Moses was in the cold before Conte dragged him to the front of the queue and he became a vital piece in the jigsaw in the wing-back driven system flanking the back three. </p>

<p>He was reborn under Conte but then the Italian left and, once again, Moses was back in the cold at Cobham.  Moses' loan with Inter did not set the world alight but in their run to the Europa League final he should have done to drum up interest for a permanent switch to Serie A. </p>

<p>With Reece James emerging from the academy and Cesar Azpilicueta still reliable on a weekly basis, Lampard may be keen to move Moses on this summer and reinvest any money his sale generates rather than see him walk for nothing in 12 months' time. </p>

<p>Victor Moses appears to have no way back at Chelsea and is likely to be shopped around Italy</p>

<p>Under contract until June 2022</p>

<p>Wage - £70,000-a-week </p>

<p>Another player the club will be desperately shopping around in Serie A this summer is David Zappacosta.  </p>

<p>The 28-year-old joined from Torino in 2017 and having previously impressed at Atalanta there was hope that, on a four-year deal, he could play a key role in wide areas for the Blues.   </p>

<p>Much like Moses, there appears to be no way back into the side for Zappacosta and while a loan would work with two years left on his deal, a permanent exit would stop the inevitable being delayed - even if Chelsea have to accept a loss on their £23m full-back. </p>

<p>His torn anterior cruciate ligament injury last October while on loan at Roma prevented him from being able to impress in the Italian capital, and just seven top flight appearances then followed.</p>

<p>Zappacosta's loan had initially been until January, but both parties agreed an extension until the end of the elongated season. It now appears Atalanta are keen on a loan to bring him back. Chelsea need to use all their powers of persuasion to convince Gian Piero Gasperini to shell out for a permanent deal.    </p>

<p>Davide Zappacosta came off the bench in the 2019 Europa League final but never really settled</p>

<p>Under contract until June 2022</p>

<p>Wage - £110,000-a-week </p>

<p>If there are concerns around players like Jorginho and Ross Barkley going forward then when it comes to Tiemoue Bakayoko there is no hope left.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old midfielder joined Chelsea in 2017 in a £40m switch from Monaco, having dazzled for the principality club in Ligue 1 and the Champions League alongside Kylian Mbappe and Co. </p>

<p>But with Chelsea facing a financial commitment of £30m if buyers aren't found for players such as Bakayoko and Batshuayi, time is of the essence to clear out those Lampard has no use for. </p>

<p>Bakayoko has spent the last two seasons out on loan, at AC Milan and then back at former side Monaco and the Blues will hope he showed enough to entice a buyer to put money where their mouth is.  </p>

<p>Tiemoue Bakayoko arrived with great expectations from Monaco but fell well short in England</p>

<p>Milan director Paulo Maldini has kept the door ajar to bring Bakayoko back as Stefano Pioli continues his rebuild at the San Siro.</p>

<p>And after the midfielder admitted last month he would be open to a return to Milan, Chelsea will be hopeful of getting Bakayoko off the wage bill.  </p>

<p>'We have many options,' Maldini told Mediaset when asked about a return for Bakayoko.</p>

<p>'We set out a list of priorities before the transfer market opened, so now we can proceed calmly. If we can improve the current squad, then we will.' </p>

<p>Under contract until June 2022 </p>

<p>Wage - £100,000-a-week </p>

<p>'Hmmm, '"Being challenged in life is inevitable, being defeated is optional..." Back at <?php echo e('@'); ?>chelseafc only for pre season... working hard, trying to get fit and be in the best shape I can be for wherever I go next,' Drinkwater wrote on his Instagram page on Monday.</p>

<p>'As much as I would love to be settled at a club like I should be, the unknown is kinda exciting.'</p>

<p>And so, it does appear the end is near for the Premier League title winner. The end of a nightmare in London appears to be close, at least. </p>

<p>The 30-year-old has seen his stock plummet since leaving Leicester City and has been out of favour for club and country for a number of seasons now, only highlighting the need to get his next move spot on. </p>

<p>Danny Drinkwater joined Chelsea for £35m but struggled and is now in need of a move away</p>

<p>Drinkwater has been told to find a new club by Chelsea before the summer window closes</p>

<p>The stars looked to have aligned when he joined Chelsea for £35m in September 2017, but injuries and lack of trust from managers meant he made only 19 appearances in two years at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>He spent the first half of last season on loan at Burnley but played only twice before being sent on loan to Aston Villa for the second half of the campaign, where he made four appearances.</p>

<p>With two years left on his deal, finding a buyer for Drinkwater could prove too tricky at this stage. Another loan looks the best bet for all parties in the short term.  </p>

<p>Under contract until June 2022 </p>

<p>Wage - £86,000-a-week </p>

<p>Another under contract for a further two years, Baba Rahman finds himself on the scrapheap as part of Lampard's revolution. </p>

<p>Rahman underwent surgery on an Achilles problem back in January and that caused havoc with his loan in Spain with Real Mallorca. </p>

<p>Another loan move beckons and Chelsea will no doubt be keen to clear at least part of his wages off for 2020-21. </p>

<p>The arrival of Ben Chilwell all but sealed the left back's point of no return this summer as Lampard works out the pieces needed for a title challenge.</p>

<p>His career has stalled since his 2015 move to Chelsea but it appears all hope is not lost on Rahman in Spain and Chelsea need to work that to secure his exit.  </p>

<p>Baba Rahman has seen a severe career decline since he made the move to Chelsea in 2015</p>
