<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Keke Palmer had her work cut out for her this weekend, hosting and performing at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards.</p>

<p>But the talented multi-hyphenate outdid herself, especially considering recent events looming over the festivities. </p>

<p>She opened Sunday's virtual awards show with a moving speech, which mentioned COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter protests that have taken place across the country in recent months before taking the stage to perform her track Snack. </p>

<p>Hostess with the mostest: Keke Palmer opened Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards with a moving speech, which mentioned COVID-19 and the Black Lives Matter movement</p>

<p>The 27-year-old said of the ongoing pandemic: 'I gotta say it, 2020 has undoubtedly been a rough year for everybody, and I'm not just talking about my edges. In fact, when something goes wrong, I just say, "2020." </p>

<p>'But as rough as it's been, there have been incredible moments of inspiration that have given my generation hope. We've seen heroes going above and beyond, whether they drive a delivery truck, work at a grocery store, or serve on the front lines in a hospital.' </p>

<p>She also mentioned the BLM movement's fight against police brutality, as they continue to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and Jacob Blake.</p>

<p>Palmer continued: 'And with the Black Lives Matter movement, we've seen our generation step up, take to the streets, and make sure our voices will be heard. Enough is enough. </p>

<p>Tough year: The 27-year-old said of the ongoing pandemic: 'I gotta say it, 2020 has undoubtedly been a rough year for everybody, and I'm not just talking about my edges'</p>

<p>Neon dream: As well as delivering her rousing speech, she also took to the stage with last month's single Snack, from her newly-released third EP Virgo Tendencies, Pt. 1</p>

<p>Retro chic: She served '80s disco queen realness in a neon yellow vinyl bodysuit, which zipped up from tiny short shorts to a retro windbreaker</p>

<p>'What we just witnessed in Kenosha, Wisconsin, is yet another devastating reminder that we can't stop, that we can never tolerate police brutality. Or any injustice...</p>

<p>'We must continue the fight to end systemic racism. The leaders of that movement are you, us, the people watching tonight. It's our time to be the change we want to see.'</p>

<p>She went viral back in June, when she urged members of the National Guard to 'march with us' in a video from a peaceful protest in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Using her platform: Palmer continued: 'And with the Black Lives Matter movement, we've seen our generation step up, take to the streets, and make sure our voices will be heard. Enough is enough'</p>

<p>Power of music: The Hustlers actress concluded her speech: 'We need to come together, and music has that power. Music can help us heal. It's all love and that's what tonight is about'</p>

<p>The Hustlers actress concluded her speech: 'We need to come together, and music has that power. Music can help us heal. It's all love and that's what tonight is about...</p>

<p>'We are making the impossible possible, pushing the boundaries of music performances, because that's what we do on the VMAs!'  </p>

<p>She kicked off the event in one of several eye-catching pieces of fashion, donning a pink and blue feathered dress.</p>

<p>The layered off-the-shoulder look featured a jeweled criss-cross halter neck, with thin jeweled stripes across the skirt. </p>

<p>Touching tribute: She also made time for another important tribute, which she filmed on her phone in a gorgeous black plunging dress</p>

<p>True hero: The Scream Queens star said: 'Before we get into the music tonight, we need to dedicate the time to talk about the devastating loss of Chadwick Boseman, an actor whose talent is a true inspiration to all the fans he touched and everyone he encountered'</p>

<p>In loving memory: Boseman died Friday at 43, following a four-year battle with colon cancer, which had previously progressed from stage III to stage IV</p>

<p>Palmer finished the look with a pair of petite gold hoop earrings and some matching metallic gold open-toe stilettos. </p>

<p>The talk show host finished the look with a neon visor, matching fingerless gloves, jeweled fishnets and sparkling rainbow laced-up chunky heels.</p>

<p>Palmer was in good company, with performances from BTS, Miley Cyrus, The Weeknd, Doja Cat, Black Eyed Peas, Ariana Grande and Lady Gaga.   </p>

<p>The hostess with the mostest filmed her segments in front of a green screen, as this year's show dropped the usual live audience format.  </p>

<p>The 2020 VMAs were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.</p>

<p>This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’</p>
