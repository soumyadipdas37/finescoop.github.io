<p>Daily Mail Australia understands the woman, who wasn't in quarantine, was staying on level one of the Pier One Hotel (pictured) in Sydney's Walsh Bay when she saw the 26-year-old through his window</p>

<p>Australian Defence Force officers who were in charge of security at the hotel became suspicious when they heard a female voice coming from the soldier's room.</p>

<p>The woman was caught by ADF officers leaving at 12.45am on Tuesday morning, before police were called. </p>

<p>New South Wales Police said in a statement that the solider and the woman were fined after he 'entertained' the hotel quest.  </p>

<p>'The woman was directed to check-out immediately and attend a COVID testing facility before self-isolating at her Hornsby home,' the statement read. </p>

<p>'The man remains in hotel quarantine and the ADF are conducting further investigations.'</p>

<p>NSW recorded seven new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday.</p>

<p>This includes four in hotel quarantine - with three overseas travellers and one returned traveller from Victoria - and two linked to a known cluster while another is still under investigation.</p>

<p>All passengers who were on the same flight as the infected NSW resident returning from Victoria in Sydney are in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>Two of the new cases are linked to the Concord Hospital and Liverpool Hospital cluster.</p>

<p>Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant says authorities are concerned about a drop in testing rates - with 8835 tests conducted in the latest 24-hour reporting period, down from 9316 the previous day.</p>
