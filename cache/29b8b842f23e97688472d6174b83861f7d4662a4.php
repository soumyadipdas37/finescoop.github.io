<p>MailOnline has contacted representatives for Faye and ITV for comment. </p>

<p>Show: According to The Sun, the former Coronation Street star will be making her return to the small screen since quitting her role as Kate Connor on the soap last year</p>

<p>Last year, Faye went public with her romance with boyfriend Joe Davies, after her split from ex-fiancé Gareth.</p>

<p>She confirmed her new romance with the personal trainer in late November as they made their red carpet debut at the White Christmas musical press night.</p>

<p>During the night, the actress leaned into Joe as he placed a hand on the small of her back, indicating the friends had grown closer since Faye's relationship with Gareth ended in July of that year.</p>

<p>Gareth, 36, is said to have found love with Ibiza DJ Chloe McLennan following his split from Faye. </p>

<p>Gareth celebrated his birthday in July with a group of family and friends, as well as with Chloe.</p>

<p>Posting a snap to Instagram, he added the caption: 'I had the best birthday. These beautiful souls are my world.'</p>

<p>He didn't tag Chloe in the post but she was present with his nearest and dearest.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'They have both been leaving loved up comments on each other's Instagram pictures from around April. They met in Ibiza earlier this year and have grown close ever since.'</p>

<p>Romance: Last year, Faye went public with her romance with boyfriend Joe Davies, after her split from ex-fiancé Gareth Gates (pictured together in March)</p>

<p>Indeed, comments have materialised online under social media snaps, with Gareth writing 'Mmmmm' under one of Chloe's sultry snaps.</p>

<p>Faye and Gareth first met when they featured in the Legally Blonde: The Musical, and went public with their relationship in August 2013.</p>

<p>In September 2018, it was reported that Faye and Gareth briefly ended their relationship when the singer's 'very controlling' behaviour led to a series of furious rows.</p>
