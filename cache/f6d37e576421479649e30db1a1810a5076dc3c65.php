<p>In 2019 Hilaria suffered two miscarriages as she tried to add to her family, both of which she candidly documented on social media in an attempt to normalize them for other women.</p>

<p>She and her Blue Jasmine actor husband wanted another daughter to their family after welcoming three boys and have publicly said they will continue trying until that happens.</p>

<p>Also in August, she revealed that her 'quarantine bubble' had thrown her a surprise baby shower.</p>
