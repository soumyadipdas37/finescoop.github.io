<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Enzo Zidane, the son of the Real Madrid manager and legend Zinedine Zidane, is set to sign for Wydad Athletic Club in Casablanca, according to his agent, Roberto Carlos.</p>

<p>Enzo, 25, who is Zidane’s eldest son, is now hoping to restart his career in Morocco and will join his fifth club in less than three years after a string of disappointing spells at clubs across Europe.</p>

<p>Wydad are a major force in African football, having won the Moroccan league 20 times and African Champions League twice in recent years. </p>

<p>Enzo Zidane worked his way through the youth ranks at Real Madrid but his career has faltered</p>

<p>But the move is a step down for the restless midfielder after spending his early years at Europe’s top tables. </p>

<p>Enzo worked his way up through the youth ranks at Juventus and Real Madrid and represented both France and Spain as a young player.</p>

<p>But while he may have followed his illustrious father to the biggest clubs in Europe as he grew up, he has never come close to emulating Zidane on the field.</p>

<p>Carlos, himself a legend of Real Madrid, making 584 appearances for the club, posted a video on Twitter addressing the Wydad club president, Said Naciri, as reported by Goal.Com.</p>

<p>After leaving Real Madrid, Enzo Zidane signed for Deportivo Alaves but stayed only six months</p>

<p>‘I am hoping to close the deal on Enzo Zidane,’ said Carlos. ‘Your club is a big club in Casablanca.’</p>

<p>Enzo was given his only first team appearance at Real by Rafa Benitez in a Copa del Rey game in 2016 against Cultural Leonesa, before spending the next two years with Real Madrid Castilla, the club’s B team.</p>

<p>He left Madrid in January 2018 – while his father was the first team coach - to join Deportivo Alaves in the Spanish LaLiga, but left there after only six months.</p>

<p>He then tried his luck in the Swiss Super League with Lausanne-Sport, where he lasted less than a year, before returning to Club de Fútbol Rayo Majadahonda in Spain’s third tier.</p>

<p>The young journeyman returned to Lausanne last summer, but this time left after six months.</p>

<p>He ended the season being relegated from Portugal’s Primeira Liga with Desportivo Aves. </p>
