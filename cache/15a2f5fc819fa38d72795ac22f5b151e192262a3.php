<p>The Eagles have had two bids in the region of £2million turned down by the Tractor Boys - but Downes is determined to join the Premier League side.</p>

<p>And the 21-year-old has underlined his intentions by tabling a transfer request as he doubles down on his wish to leave Portman Road.</p>

<p>Flynn Downes has handed in a transfer request to force a move through to Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Sources claim that Downes is frustrated at Ipswich’s stance after the club told him they would not stand in his way if a Premier League club came in for him.</p>

<p>Lee O’Neill, Ipswich’s general manager of football operations, confirmed two bids have been rejected for Downes.</p>

<p>‘We have received two bids for Flynn over the last week or two but they are nowhere near the club’s valuation,’ said O’Neill.</p>

<p>Ipswich Town have turned down two bids in the region of £2m for their star midfielder</p>

<p>‘Marcus (Evans, club owner] rejected them straightaway and he has spoken personally to Flynn to make him aware of the club’s position.</p>

<p>‘Every player strives to play at the highest level and Flynn is no different. We fully un-derstand why a move to the Premier League would appeal to him but until the club receives an offer that meets our valuation there is no decision to make.</p>

<p>‘We want to keep Flynn here because he is seen as a key part of our plans. We cer-tainly don’t welcome offers for him but we have to be realistic and accept that the good, young players we have here are going to attract interest.’</p>
