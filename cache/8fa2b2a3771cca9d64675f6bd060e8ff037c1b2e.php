<p>Officials have linked the rise in crime to the pandemic, a surge in unemployment, civil unrest and protests.</p>

<p>There was a 162 per cent increase in the number of shooting victims and a 166 per cent increase in the number of shooting incidents during the four-week period that ended on August 23 compared to the same period last year, police data shows.</p>

<p>During the four-week period ending on August 23, the city recorded 48 homicides - a 50 per cent increase from the 32 homicides that were recorded during the same period last year.</p>

<p>Between January 1 and August 23, the city recorded 280 homicides - a 35 per cent increase from 208 homicides that were recorded during the same period of 2019.</p>

<p>In July, murders were up 58.8 percent when compared to the same month last year. Shootings were up a staggering 177 per cent.</p>

<p>In Manhattan's Upper West Side residents have complained and threatened to sue the Mayor after homeless people were moved into three luxury hotels in the area to protect them from COVID-19.</p>

<p>Residents of the upscale neighborhood complain that the move-in of the vagrants has brought with it increased crime, random violence, drugs, public urination and open prostitution.</p>

<p>At the moment more than 13,000 homeless people are being housed in 139 hotels across the Big Apple, including three luxury hotels – The Belleclaire, The Lucerne and The Belnord – on the Upper West Side.</p>

<p>The uptick in crime comes as protests have unfolded across the country denouncing police brutality and seeking to defund police departments.</p>

<p>New York City announced it will slash the police budget by $1billion in July. The department budget was almost $6billion for the 2020 fiscal year. </p>
