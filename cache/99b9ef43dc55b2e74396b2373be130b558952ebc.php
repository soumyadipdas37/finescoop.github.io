<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves have released their third kit for the 2020-2021 season and it's hard not to see the inspiration behind the design.</p>

<p>As well as manager Nuno Espirito Santo, the Premier League side have nine first-team players from Portugal and fans believe the new strip is a reference to their Portuguese connections.</p>

<p>The maroon-coloured shirt with a green trim, green shorts and socks looks remarkably similar to what Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes wear at international level.Â </p>

<p>Wolves' third kit for the 2020-2021 season has a strong similarity to Portugal's home shirt</p>

<p>The Premier League side's new strip is maroon with a green trim, green short and green socksÂ </p>

<p>The shirt has a strong resemblance to the one worn by Cristiano Ronaldo at international level</p>

<p>Portugal's home kit often includes green socks and shorts have regularly been switched from green to maroon.</p>

<p>Supporters quickly spotted the similarity of the two kits with many believing it was a deliberate design to highlight the Portuguese talent in their squad.</p>

<p>One fan wrote: 'We are officially Portugal!' while another added: 'Actually went full on Portugal. Quite like it to be fair.'</p>

<p>Always moving forward. #ReadyToBeBraveThe new Wolves X <?php echo e('@'); ?>adidasfootball third kit!Pre order now ðŸ‘‰ https://t.co/ICFAu5nPgN pic.twitter.com/q6JdMcw0jz</p>

<p>Others found the resemblance amusing, with one supporter writing: 'This is not going to help with other fans' opinion that we are basically Portugal. Do I care? No.'</p>

<p>Another joked: 'It's official: Wolverhampton Wanderers is not an English club anymore. They have finally become the Portugal national team.'</p>

<p>Wolves added more Portuguese faces to their squad this summerÂ with the signings of Vitor Ferreira and Fabio Silva who have both represented their country at youth level.</p>

<p>Ferreira has arrived on loan with Wolves having an option to buy the midfielder for Â£17.9million at the end of the season while Silva became the club's record signing in a Â£35m deal.</p>

<p>Ruben Neves (above) is one of nine Wolves first-team players who originate from Portugal</p>

<p>Â Joao Moutinho (above) is also from Portugal as is the club's manager Nuno Espirito Santo</p>

<p>The pair join fellow countrymen goalkeeper Rui Patricio, Ruben Vinagre, Ruben Neves, Ruben Vinagre, Daniel Podence, Joao Moutinho, Pedro Neto, and Diogo Jota.Â Â </p>

<p>Fans of other clubs recognised the connection with an Arsenal fan replying: 'No way it's a Portugal kit'.</p>

<p>A West Ham supporter responded to suggestions the kit resembled Portugal's strip by writing: 'Exactly what I thought. They buy some many Portuguese players so it sorta makes sense (sic).'</p>

<p>But some Wolves fans loved the fact the club seemed to be taking aim at rival fans who refer to Wolves as 'little Portugal'.Â </p>

<p>It's safe to say many of Wolves' first-team squad will certainly feel at home when they wear the new kit for the first time.Â </p>
