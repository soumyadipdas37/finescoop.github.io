<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>In the run-up to FIFA 21's grand launch on October 6, the biggest stars in football and fans alike are eager to find out the players ratings. </p>

<p>One of the key components on the game is dribbling ability and there are some familiar faces with the highest ratings in that category this year. </p>

<p>Unsurprisingly Lionel Messi (95) and Neymar (94) are the top two but below them is where it gets more interesting.  </p>

<p>Bernardo Silva, Eden Hazard and Jadon Sancho are among the best dribblers on FIFA 21</p>

<p>Jadon Sancho is rated 91 in dribbling and can terrorise opposition defences with his skills </p>

<p>Manchester City's pocket playmaker Bernardo Silva is tied with Real Madrid winger Eden Hazard with a rating on 92 with Jadon Sancho just behind on 91. </p>

<p>On Tuesday we revealed the fastest players on the game with Kylian Mbappe, Adama Traore and Vinicius Junior top of the pile. </p>

<p>And dribbling is a key stat to go with the pace for gamers looking to get their hands on a copy of the latest edition of the popular franchise. </p>

<p>Liverpool fans will also be delighted by the dribbling ratings of their front three. </p>

<p>Bernardo Silva can squeeze out of tight spaces with his dribbling, reflected in his 92 rating</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp's triumvirate of Mo Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino are all highly ranked in this category, each with a score of 90. </p>

<p>Paulo Dybala is rated 91 in the dribbling department, one higher than his team-mate Douglas Costa. </p>

<p>Manchester City also have a front three to be reckoned with as Raheem Sterling (90) and Riyad Mahrez (90) have the stats to back up their technical ability in real life. </p>

<p>The trio above are ones for managers in career mode to snap up and develop into stars</p>

<p>For players of career mode in FIFA, three hidden gems have been revealed.</p>

<p>Budding managers wanting to develop youngsters in their side and grow them into world class talents will be keen to take a look. </p>
