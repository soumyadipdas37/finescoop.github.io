<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian woman has left the internet in stitches after purchasing a $4.50 celebration sign from Kmart only to find it had a major spelling mistake.</p>

<p>The mother shared an image of her faulty decoration on Facebook, blaming the discount retailer for spelling 'Happy Birthday' incorrectly on her husband's special day.</p>

<p>'WTF Kmart?????? Harpy Dipthbay!!!!! WTF?????' she captioned the photo.</p>

<p>More than 10,000 people on social media 'liked' the post, calling the issue 'peak 2020' and a fabulous description of birthdays during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'The person who assembled it probably can't read English and is doing the assembly based off the colours. The letters they swapped around are the same colours. (R and P both yellow, D and B both red),' said one person.</p>

<p>'Wonder what the Kmart elves were on when they put that one together?' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'It looks like someone has been celebrating before the party'. </p>

<p>Some suggested that it was an easy fix and she could just pull all of the letters off the string and start from scratch.</p>

<p>On the Kmart website the Glitter Happy Birthday Bunting product is said to contain 13 pieces and has 'Happy Birthday spelled out'</p>

<p>But others said leaving it misspelt would be far funnier in photos and she should take advantage of the mistake.</p>
