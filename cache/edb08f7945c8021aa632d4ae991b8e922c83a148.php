<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain's former world flyweight champion Charlie Edwards fled what he described as the 'self-crucifying hell' of his battle with the scales to start a new boxing life on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Edwards came dancing into Bethnal Green's iconic York Hall as a rebooted bantamweight.</p>

<p>He defeated a willing Kyle Williams by a wide margin but it was not all sweetness and light for the baby-faced Edwards.</p>

<p>Charlie Edwards beat Kyle Williams 99-91 over ten rounds at Bethnal Green's York Hall</p>

<p>The speed was just as lightning despite him being two divisions heavier.</p>

<p>But the question of whether he has brought strength and power up with him remains to be answered if he is to realise his ambition of becoming a two-weight world champion next year.</p>

<p>Not only did his flurries of punches fail to have any significant impact on the gallant Williams but he was staggered three or four times by his limited opponent.</p>

<p>Edwards, a former world flyweight champion, has commenced a career as a bantamweight</p>

<p>There was no arguing with referee Bob Williams as he declared Edwards a 99-91 winner over ten rounds.</p>

<p>That score was earned largely by his jab. But physically Edwards still has some growing to do if he is not to be picked off by world class bantamweights who have little to fear from his punches.</p>
