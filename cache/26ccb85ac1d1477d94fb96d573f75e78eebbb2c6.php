<p>The toddler lost his life a couple of days after accident which happened on Wednesday morning at the home in Fayetteville, in the center of the state.</p>

<p>A two-year-old boy was killed after he accidentally shot himself at a home in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Wednesday  morning. He later died in hospital on Friday from his injuries</p>

<p>Officers were called to a house in the McArthur Place Community.</p>

<p>Fayetteville Police Department, Lt. Gary Womble confirmed the presence of three other people at the time of the emergency call although it has not been revealed who, if any, were supposed to be watching the child. </p>

<p>'In my opinion, any gunshot wound is serious, especially when it happens to a juvenile,' said Womble during a press conference, as reported by WTVD.</p>

<p>'It's even more serious and more serious for us in our investigative methods to find out exactly what occurred that a child would suffer a gunshot wound. That's important to us and that's what the detectives are working hard to determine what happened.'   </p>

<p>Fayetteville Police Department, Lt. Gary Womble said there were three other people at the home where the shooting took place but it was not clear who was looking  after the child</p>

<p>One neighbor told the station that she witnessed a woman crying outside of the home in the moments before police and paramedics arrived on the scene. </p>

<p>The child was taken to UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill immediately after Wednesday's shooting but later died from his injuries on Friday. </p>

<p>So far, the identity of the child or those who were with him at the time have not been made public as the investigation progresses. </p>
