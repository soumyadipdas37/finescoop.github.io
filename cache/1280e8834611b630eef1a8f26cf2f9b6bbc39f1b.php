<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Survivors of the Christchurch mosque attack have demanded Australia pay for Brenton Tarrant's jail bill.</p>

<p>The terrorist was jailed for life without parole after he murdered 51 people and injured dozens more in a massacre at the Al-Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre on March 15, 2019.</p>

<p>Now, victims of the brutal attack want Australia to pick up the bill for incarcerating the 29-year-old in Auckland's Paremoremo Prison, which comes at a price of NZ$4,930 (AUD$4,512) per day.</p>

<p>John Milne's 14-year-old son Sayyad was killed by Tarrant in the racially motivated attack and he believes New Zealanders should not be charged for his actions.</p>

<p>'I think Australia needs to pay the total cost for what we've spent already, they need to pay that plus ongoing. They need to cough up big time,' he told RNZ.</p>

<p>'There's a big bill out there for this now, he's Australian, not a Kiwi, we shouldn't have to pay for any of it.'</p>

<p>Tarrant grew up in the northern New South Wales town of Grafton before moving to New Zealand in 2017 and settling in the South Island town of Dunedin.</p>

<p>The first two years of his sentence alone will cost $NZ3.59 million ($A3.33 million), with the entirety of his time in jail set to cost tens of millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Abdul Aziz chased Tarrant out of Linwood Islamic Centre following the attack and said the money being spent on his imprisonment could be much better spent. </p>

<p>'We can do a lot better things than spending it on that coward,' he said. </p>

<p>New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters wants Tarrant to serve his sentence in Australia and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was open to the idea. </p>

<p>'I know all Australians and New Zealanders want to see this character locked up to never see the light of day again - I agree with that,' he told Sunrise.</p>

<p>'Whether he is held in New Zealand or Australia, we're open to that discussion.' </p>

<p>There would need to be some changes to legal arrangements between Australia and New Zealand for the transfer to happen because the two countries do not have a prisoner transfer agreement.</p>

<p>Such an agreement would allow New Zealanders jailed in Australia to also be sent home. </p>

<p>Another option would be for Canberra and Wellington to reach a one-off agreement just for Tarrant.</p>

<p>In either case, Tarrant would have to serve the same sentence of life without parole unless New Zealand consented to a discount which is extremely unlikely, ANU legal expert professor Don Rothwell told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison said he and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern would work through the issues involved.</p>

<p>'It has a lot of implications, these sorts of decisions. The Prime Minister of New Zealand and I will talk about those issues,' Mr Morrison said. </p>

<p>'Mostly, we're concerned about what the views of the families would be, of those affected, and we want to do the right thing by them.'</p>

<p>'There has been no request made for that (transfer), I should stress.'</p>

<p>Tarrant's sentence is the harshest penalty ever doled out by a New Zealand court and guarantees he will die behind bars regardless of which country he is in. </p>

<p>On Thursday, Prime Minister Ardern said Tarrant's crime was one that the country 'has never seen the likes of before and this is a sentence we've never seen before'.</p>

<p>'It gave me relief, to know that person will never see the light of day,' she said. 'The trauma of March 15 is not easily healed, but today I hope is the last where we have any cause to hear or utter the name of the terrorist behind it. </p>

<p>'His deserves to be a lifetime of complete and utter silence.'</p>
