<p>Natalia wore her dirty blonde locks in loose curls for the occasion and opted to keep her makeup natural, with a touch of gloss swept across her lips.</p>

<p>She carried a small bouquet of flowers, which added a touch of colour to her all white outfit.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Antoine opted for a dark blue suit with a white shirt and a bright blue tie. </p>

<p>The happy couple were met by cheering guests as they left the civil ceremony, many of whom could be seen wearing masks as they threw confetti onto the newly weds.</p>

<p>Appearing on Suzie Menke's podcast Creative Conversations in June, she revealed the couple had planned to host their wedding guests at a gala dinner at Ruinart's house. </p>

<p>She also explained that her wedding dress was not yet ready for the event, because she had not been able to try it on amid the Covid-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>She revealed she had been inspired by shots from the wedding of Grace Kelly, but wanted a 'more rock and roll version' of the dress. </p>
