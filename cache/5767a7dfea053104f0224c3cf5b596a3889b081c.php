<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Could mild flu seasons in the past few winters be to blame for Britain's huge toll of Covid-19 deaths?</p>

<p>That is the controversial theory being hawked by the man responsible for Sweden's light-touch response to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Anders Tegnell, Sweden's chief epidemiologist, won praise for his nation's low infection rates compared with the rest of Europe.</p>

<p>But he has been damned for its high death toll among the infected.</p>

<p>With 5,685 fatalities, Sweden's Covid-19 death rate is ten times higher than in neighbouring Norway and Finland. It is the fifth-highest per capita in Europe.</p>

<p>Could mild flu seasons in the past few winters be to blame for Britain's huge toll of Covid-19 deaths? Anders Tegnell (pictured), Sweden's chief epidemiologist, won praise for his nation's low infection rates compared with the rest of Europe</p>

<p>Unlike most of Europe, Sweden allowed shops, restaurants and schools to open throughout the pandemic.</p>

<p>Yet infection rates remained low – due in part to highly targeted social distancing, which is easier in a country whose population is six times smaller than the UK's but has nearly double the landmass.</p>

<p>However, among Swedes who did get infected, death rates soared. Why?</p>

<p>Tegnell is blaming flu. Or rather, the lack of flu in recent years.</p>

<p>He has said that normal flu epidemics kill large numbers of vulnerable (often older) people during winter. If that doesn't happen, the frail survive only to be killed by something else.</p>

<p>'When many people die of the flu in winter, fewer die in heatwaves the following summer,' he told a Swedish newspaper.</p>

<p>Unlike most of Europe, Sweden (pictured, Stranvagen in Stockholm) allowed shops, restaurants and schools to open throughout the pandemic</p>

<p>This time the pandemic did the killing instead of heat.</p>

<p>'In this case it was Covid-19 that caused many to die,' he argues. And the same is true for the UK, claims Tegnell.</p>

<p>'Countries that had a fairly low mortality rate for influenza in the past two, three years, have a very high excess mortality for Covid-19,' he says. 'That also explained the high death rate in the UK.'</p>

<p>But is this plausible? Tegnell is, after all, only the latest in a parade of virus tsars bandying science to explain why their original scientific policies didn't work.</p>

<p>Well, Tegnell is right about the UK's high mortality rate. Our deaths per capita, at 627 per million, outstrip Sweden's 575 per million.</p>

<p>Tegnell has said that normal flu epidemics kill large numbers of vulnerable (often older) people during winter</p>

<p>But that doesn't necessarily mean that his mild-flu theory tells the entire story.</p>

<p>Of course, there can be no doubt that in the past few years, the UK has seen peak flu seasons, with the winter of 2017-18 being especially bad.</p>

<p>From October to January, three times as many people died of flu in the UK compared with the previous winter.</p>

<p>This week researchers from Public Health England warned that patients who simultaneously get flu and Covid-19 are more than twice as likely to die than those who contract Covid-19 alone. Pictured, London</p>

<p>Indeed, the year saw 50,000 excess winter deaths, the highest recorded since 1975/76, according to the Office for National Statistics, which blamed the increase on virulent flu strains and cold temperatures.</p>

<p>Emerging evidence does, however, suggest that having a lot of flu around might actually help now to reduce Covid-19 deaths. But not for the reasons Tegnell suggests. For rather than just killing off vulnerable people, the flu infection may help to arm us against Covid-19. This is because having any viral infection boosts your immune defences' readiness to fight the next viral invader.</p>

<p>In fact, researchers at Yale University bolstered the theory this month by reporting in the journal, The Lancet Microbe, that catching a cold may help to prevent flu infecting us – because having a cold jump-starts the body's viral defences.</p>

<p>And earlier, in June, researchers at Germany's Tubingen University went so far as to suggest that respiratory viruses such as colds might even help to arm our defences against Covid-19.</p>

<p>So Tegnell might be partly right – though for the wrong reasons – about flu reducing Covid-19 death rates.</p>

<p>But if the theory about viral exposure boosting Covid-19 protection is correct, then we still have a problem.</p>

<p>For lockdown restrictions not only reduced infections of Covid-19 – they also reduced our exposure to cold and flu.</p>

<p>In normal summers, we get only small doses of these viruses as we're not huddling together in fuggy rooms, so we usually shrug them off.</p>

<p>This year, however, we've been physically isolated, and hospital doctors are now reporting child and older adult patients coming in with aggressive colds, for which their defences were not prepared.</p>

<p>So how do we beat this? One way would be to kid our immune systems into thinking they are fighting a hard flu season by administering a flu vaccine.</p>

<p>Dr David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at Exeter University Medical School who is helping to formulate the British Medical Association's guidelines on symptoms, says: 'There is soft evidence that a flu vaccine will stimulate your viral immune system and make Covid-19 infections less aggressive.'</p>

<p>And so as well as flu jabs being available free on the NHS for the over-65s and young children, the Government is aiming to give them to all over-50s – resources permitting – to protect hospitals from being overwhelmed by demand.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, vaccinations could also protect us from the threat of 'twindemic' infection. This week researchers from Public Health England warned that patients who simultaneously get flu and Covid-19 are more than twice as likely to die than those who contract Covid-19 alone.</p>

<p>All of which means that exposure to flu, in the form of vaccination, may prove a vital shot in the arm against the coronavirus pandemic – even if the Swedes don't understand why.</p>
