<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A self-confessed 'battler' who hit The Lott jackpot has revealed how it will change her life - and that does not include quitting her job. </p>

<p>The woman, from Proserpine, 20 minutes inland from Airlie Beach in Queensland's Whitsundays, won division one of Set For Life draw 1850 on Saturday and will be given $20,000 every month over the next two decades.</p>

<p>She will pocket a total of $4.8million by 2040, and she was 'completely speechless' when she found out.</p>

<p>Set For Life is the only game in Australia where people can play numbers across seven daily draws.</p>

<p>There have been 65 division one winners since the game launched in 2015, including the woman from Central Queensland. </p>

<p>The woman's five-game QuickPick was purchased at Fresh Fields News &amp; Gifts, 89 Main Street, Proserpine (pictured) </p>

<p>'I can't believe this has happened to me. I never in a million years thought I would win division one,' the woman said, according to The Lott.</p>

<p>'This is incredible. It's absolutely incredible. </p>

<p>'I have to come back down to earth. I am at work right now.'</p>

<p>The woman received the call from The Lott officials on Monday and said her plans would be to 'definitely finish the day at work.'</p>

<p>'I can't let my team down. But I will celebrate later today.'</p>

<p>While the woman needed time to think about how the winnings would change her life, she was adamant she would continue working but conceded she 'might cut back a bit'. </p>

<p>'I might do some volunteering instead,' she said.</p>

<p>The woman told The Lott she would also 'share some with my family too' and donate to charity - but not before buying herself a new car.</p>

<p>'I just don't even know what I will do with the rest of the prize,' she said.</p>

<p>'I won't be worried about looking out for things on sale now though.</p>

<p>'We've always been battlers, so this changes everything for my family.' </p>

<p>Owner Barbara Cochrane said it was the first division one entry since July last year.</p>

<p>She has been sharing the 'good news' with her customers and 'the staff are going to celebrate with a cold beverage.' </p>

<p>'Since we took ownership, we have had three major wins in three years,' Ms Cochrane said. </p>

<p>'We would like to send our congratulations and best wishes to our winner, and we would like to say thank you for supporting our store.</p>

<p>'This win is very exciting and it is great to have something positive to focus on in these uncertain times.'</p>
