<p>This is the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK - and case numbers are expected to rise, the Welsh Government said.</p>

<p>Health minister Vaughan Gething said: 'We have seen a significant rise in cases in Caerphilly borough over a very short space of time, which are linked to holiday travel abroad and people socialising indoors and not following social distancing guidelines. </p>

<p>Community testing was introduced in Caerphilly at the weekend.</p>

<p>On Saturday, 450 people were tested and 19 had the virus - giving a positivity rate of 4 per cent, which indicates that Covid-19 is circulating in the community.   </p>

<p>Caerphilly Council has already introduced measures such as suspending care home visits, and introducing weekly testing for care home staff, in response to the increase in cases.</p>

<p>Philippa Marsden, leader of Caerphilly Council, said: 'We need to create a break in the cycle of infection we are seeing in Caerphilly borough at the moment and unfortunately that means introducing new, tougher restrictions.</p>
