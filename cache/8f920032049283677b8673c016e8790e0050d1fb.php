<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Crystal Palace are weighing up a move for Vitesse Arnhem defender Max Clark ahead of next month's transfer deadline. </p>

<p>The Eagles are in the market for a new left back with doubts over Patrick van Aanholt's future. </p>

<p>The Dutchman, who is currently out injured, has less than 12 months on his current deal, leaving his future unclear.</p>

<p>Max Clark has emerged as a strong contender to replace Patrick van Aanholt at Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Youngster Tyrick Mitchell has ably deputised for Van Aanholt, but the Eagles remain on the look out for a new left back. </p>

<p>And Clark is understood to be among the options Palace are considering ahead of the October 5 deadline.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old impressed in Holland last season having moved to Vitesse in 2018, and has attracted attention from a number of English clubs.</p>

<p>Clark has appeared for England at Under-16 and Under-17 level, playing alongside the likes of Everton forward Alex Iwobi, former Chelsea wing back Ola Aina and Liverpool winger Sheyi Ojo across the two age groups.  </p>

<p>Van Aanholt has not played since dislocating his shoulder near the end of last season</p>

<p>Clark has a solitary Europa League appearance under his belt and made his debut for Vitesse as a replacement for former Manchester United left back Alexander Buttner. </p>

<p>As well as Buttner, he has played for Vitesse alongside former Portugal international goalkeeper Eduardo, Chelsea duo Jake Clarke-Salter and Charly Musonda and Real Madrid playmaker Martin Odegaard. </p>

<p>Clark's breakthrough season in England arguably came in 2017-18 when he made 27 Championship appearances for his hometown club Hull, in a side featuring Harry Wilson, Fikayo Tomori, Michael Dawson and Jarrod Bowen.</p>

<p>The former Tiger's contract expires at the end of this season, raising hopes from a number of sides that he may be obtainable.</p>
