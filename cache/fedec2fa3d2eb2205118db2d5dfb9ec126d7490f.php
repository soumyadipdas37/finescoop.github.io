<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Juventus are set to land Luis Suarez in a deal worth just £4.4million as Barcelona continue their summer clear out under new boss Ronald Koeman.</p>

<p>At 33-years-old, Barca are keen to move on the striker in a bid to ease their wage bill and Juventus are hopeful a cut-price deal for the former Liverpool hitman can be done within the next three weeks in time for the start of the new Serie A campaign.</p>

<p>According to Sky Sports Italia, Juventus are hoping that with Suarez in their side they could field one of the best front three in Europe alongside Cristiano Ronaldo and Paulo Dybala.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez is set to leave Barcelona after six years service this summer to join Juventus</p>

<p>Juventus have excellent relations with Barcelona and are confident an agreement for Suarez's move to the Allianz Stadium can be arranged swiftly.</p>

<p>Suarez has already agreed a three-year-deal with Juve worth around £9million-a-year with bonus clauses to be added.</p>

<p>However, the deal could be held up by Suarez's financial demands from the Nou Camp outfit in relation to the move.</p>

<p>However Suarez is still demanding up to £22million in severance pay from Barcelona</p>

<p>It is understood the Uruguay hitman is demanding £22m in severance pay and is not willing to negotiate lowering his request.</p>

<p>Barca are more hopeful that with Juventus being the striker's choice of destination he will eventually lower his demands having been caught pleasantly surprised by the interest shown in him by the Italian champions.</p>

<p>Suarez's contract at the Nou Camp expires next summer having joined them six years ago from Liverpool.</p>

<p>Suarez's six years at Barca have seen him score 198 goals in just 283 games at the Nou Camp</p>

<p>He has enjoyed a successful spell at Barcelona in that time, netting 198 goals in 283 games.</p>

<p>However despite scoring an impressive 21 goals in 36 games last season, he was sidelined by knee surgery in the first part of 2020.</p>

<p>Despite returning post lockdown he was unable to prevent Barca's downturn in form which included losing the LaLiga title to rivals Real Madrid and suffering a humiliating 8-2 defeat by Bayern Munich in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.  </p>
