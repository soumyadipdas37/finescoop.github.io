<p>'You can spot the Melburnians in a second,' he told the Herald Sun's Page 13.</p>

<p>'They just reek of Melbourne. Puffer jackets and ironed jeans. I mean what’s with that?'   </p>

<p>His harsh comments were echoed by another local, artist Kane Latty.</p>

<p>'It was bad enough before the school holidays, but now they all ponce around thinking they're the Hemsworths. Go f***ing home,' he said.  </p>

<p>Baywatch star Zac Efron also relocated to the coastal community sparking fears that the town was losing its 'community atmosphere'.</p>

<p>In a recent post shared to a Byron Bay Facebook group, one local wrote: 'Byron Bay used to be inclusive. If you don't have a tonne of money forget it.</p>

<p>'And by the way, I've lived in Byron Bay for nearly forty years, so it's got nothing to do with tall poppy [syndrome]. It's to do with losing the community atmosphere.</p>

<p>'Now it's all AirBnBs, this is what I don't like,' they finished. </p>
