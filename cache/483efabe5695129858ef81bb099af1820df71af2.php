<p>Mr Russian was reportedly called by 'senior people within the Liberal Party' who asked him to run for Lord Mayor of Melbourne on Wednesday night</p>

<p>After taking a five-year break from Twitter, Mr Russian has returned to the platform during the lockdown by retweeting posts that are critical of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews.    </p>

<p>Melburnians are currently banned from dining in at hospitality venues under the lockdown and can only use takeaway or delivery options. </p>

<p>'Rebuilding business must be a key to the city's recovery and Nick (Russian) has the runs on the board and respect for this,' a Liberal Party insider told The Herald Sun.   </p>

<p>He now runs Together Events, which is 'a luxury lifestyle and events brand created for sophisticated, fun and fashion conscious individuals'. </p>

<p>The hospitality honcho is married to ballerina-turned-influencer Rozalia Russian, who has more than 255,000 followers on Instagram. </p>
