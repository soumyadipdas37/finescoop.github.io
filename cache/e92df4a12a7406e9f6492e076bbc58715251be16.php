<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea defender Ethan Ampadu is wanted on loan at Sheffield United.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old is at a crucial stage of his career where he needs to play more regular, competitive football and Chris Wilder is willing to give him an opportunity at Bramall Lane.</p>

<p>Sheffield United boss Wilder is adding a number of players with deals lined up for Derby County full-backs Jayden Bogle and Max Lowe while Ollie Burke is due in from West Brom as part of his swap with Callum Robinson.</p>

<p>Sheffield United are interested in taking Chelsea defender Ethan Ampadu on loan for 2020-21</p>

<p>The 19-year-old defender impressed for Wales against Bulgaria in the Nations League </p>

<p>Chris Wilder wants to build another strong squad to improve on a stellar 2019-20 campaign</p>

<p>The versatile Ampadu was outstanding in central defence as Wales opened their Nations League campaign with a 1-0 win in Finland last Thursday.</p>

<p>But Ampadu, who also operates as a holding midfielder, has had to endure frustration at club level with limited game-time at Chelsea and Red Bull Leipzig, where he spent last season on loan.</p>

<p>Wales boss Ryan Giggs underlined he had spoken at length with Ampadu about his next move. </p>

<p>Ampadu is in need of first-team games, which he is unlikely to get amid Chelsea's revolution</p>

<p>He said: 'It's that balance over whether they're at a top club and surrounded by top players and improving every day, but ultimately you need minutes on the pitch. That's a decision for Ethan. I've talked to him a lot about that.</p>

<p>'I think last year was maybe a little bit different as he had injuries. You could see from the game he played against Tottenham in the Champions League he was outstanding.</p>

<p>'Nothing fazes him, he's a quality player, and he just needs to keep fit now.'</p>
