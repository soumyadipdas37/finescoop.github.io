<p>'Thank you very much indeed. This is such a very nice moment and it's very sad not to be with the cast and some of the crew to share it with you all tonight, but this is a wonderful achievement for the whole group,' Armstrong said.</p>

<p>His speech was briefly interrupted by a telephone ringing, with Armstrong quipping, 'Room service, probably,' as Kieran Culkin was seen laughing in another video.</p>

<p>'But for being robbed of the opportunity to spend this time with our peers and with the cast and crew, I think I'd maybe like to do some un-thank yous,' Armstrong added.</p>

<p>Nice moment: 'Thank you very much indeed. This is such a very nice moment and it's very sad not to be with the cast and some of the crew to share it with you all tonight, but this is a wonderful achievement for the whole group,' Armstrong said</p>

<p>'Un-thank you to the virus for keeping us all apart this year. Un-thank you to Trump for his crummy and uncoordinated response, un-thank you to Boris Johnson and his government for doing the same in my country,' he added.</p>

<p>He added, 'un-thank you to all the nationalist and quasi-nationalist governments in the world that are exactly the opposite of what we need right now and un-thank you to the media moguls who do so much to keep them in power. So un-thank you,' he concluded.</p>

<p>After the ceremony ended, Armstrong revealed his celebratory plans in the U.K. involved grabbing some breakfast.</p>

<p>'(I'm) hopefully by going to breakfast because it’s 4 a.m. [in the U.K.] and in case something positive happened I didn’t drink anything so I’m hoping for a champagne breakfast with this lovely group,' he said.</p>

<p>Armstrong added, 'It’s the kind of celebration an old person would have' after the ceremony.</p>

<p>Armstrong's hit series Succession took home seven Emmys out of 18 nominations in its second season at HBO. </p>
