<p>Will and his old music collaborator DJ Jazzy Jeff, enjoyed some alone time playing around the mansion before the rest of the cast showed up. </p>

<p>They checked out the inside of the mansion, that becomes available for one night stays on Airbnb September 29, for only $30 a night. </p>

<p>The duo looked around the clothing items included in the room, made to look like the pool house Will lived in for the second half of the show. </p>

<p>Along with his sneaker and hat collection, clothing items were displayed on hangers, and were pieces from the anniversary collection from the show. </p>

<p>Stocked: Along with his sneaker and hat collection, clothing items were displayed on hangers, and were pieces from the anniversary collection from the show</p>

<p>And true to their music roots, Will and Jeff made some beats with silverware, wine glasses and the floor as they sat at the large formal dining table. </p>

<p>Former show stars Tatyana Ali and Karyn Parsons, who played cousins Ashley and Hilary Banks, were joined by Joseph Marcell who starred as Geoffrey Butler for all six seasons of the show. </p>

<p>As well, Daphne Maxwell Reid who played Aunt Vivian Banks from seasons four to six joined, though the original actor Janet Hubert-Whitten was not in attendance, nor was Alfonso Ribeiro, who originated Carlton Banks. </p>

<p>Making beats: And true to their music roots, Will and Jeff made some beats with silverware, wine glasses and the floor as they sat at the large formal dining table </p>

<p>Also missing was the famous Uncle Phil, played by James Avery who died in 2013.  </p>

<p>Though the group was sure to honor the character and late actor, as a smiling portrait of him hung inside the house, and caught all of the actor's attention.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Will teased the video by sharing a photo of himself and DJ Jazzy Jeff in front of the Bel Air mansion. </p>

<p>The Bad Boys actor was celebrating a partnership with the luxurious mansion's owners to rent off a wing of the home on Airbnb for an astoundingly cheap $30 per night to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary.</p>

<p>Regal: The table was set for a king, with silver plate covers, multiple flower displays and plenty of glasses</p>

<p>Friends: DJ Jazzy Jeff costarred on the show for all six seasons, prior to the show he and Will collaborated together on rap albums, three that went Gold or Platinum before the show was created</p>

<p>Back together: Former show stars Tatyana Ali and Karyn Parsons, who played cousins Ashley and Hilary Banks, were joined by Joseph Marcell who starred as Geoffrey Butler for all six seasons of the show </p>

<p>Fun: With some film tricks they made it look like Will was oversized for the house </p>

<p>Will's Instagram selfie showed himself beaming in a green white and black tie-dye jacket over a white shirt, while Jeff wore gray–blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up and gestured toward the mansion.</p>

<p>'YOOOO!! Y’all think we should rent out the <?php echo e('@'); ?>freshprince house?? We’re making it happen with the squad at <?php echo e('@'); ?>airbnb!!' he wrote, adding, '#FreshPrince30th.'</p>

<p>Although the mansion was advertised as being in the tony neighborhood of Bel Air, the real-life location is located in the similarly upscale LA neighborhood Brentwood.</p>

<p>The mansion was used on the series for exterior shooting, but the interiors were all filmed on a stage. </p>

<p>Celebrating: The Bad Boys actor was celebrating a partnership with the luxurious mansion's owners to rent off a wing of the home on Airbnb for an astoundingly cheap $30 per night to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary </p>

<p>Sister, sister: Former show stars Tatyana Ali and Karyn Parsons, who played cousins Ashley and Hilary Banks, marveled at the house</p>

<p>Perfect: Joseph Marcell who starred as Geoffrey Butler for all six seasons of the show, fixed the silverware on the dining table to perfection</p>

<p>Signing: As well, Daphne Maxwell Reid who played Aunt Vivian Banks from seasons four to six joined, though the original actor Janet Hubert-Whitten, she signed a wall inside the room</p>

<p>Will is partnering with the Airbnb and the mansion's owners to open up a portion of the home for a limited number of nights.</p>

<p>Though he doesn't own the home, he's listed as the host on Airbnb.</p>

<p>'Ready for the freshest staycation ever?' he wrote. 'If this place looks familiar that’s because it’s just as fly as it was when I first rolled up the driveway. I’m back. And this time, I’m handing you the keys so you’ll have my wing of the mansion all to yourself — but my sneaker collection is off limits, aight?'  </p>

<p>Although Will and his costar didn't film inside the actual mansion, it has since been decorated as if his character live there, with an opulent bedroom film with graffiti art, memorabilia and a hat and sneaker collection display.</p>

<p>Gone but never forgotten: Also missing was the famous Uncle Phil, played by James Avery who died in 2013. Though the group was sure to honor the character and late actor, as a smiling portrait of him hung inside the house, and caught all of the actor's attention </p>

<p>Tease: Earlier this month, Will teased the video by sharing a photo of himself and DJ Jazzy Jeff in front of the Bel Air mansion  </p>

<p>Despite all the expensive decorations, Will's Airbnb ad says guests can lace up 'a fresh pair of Jordans before shooting some b-ball in the bedroom.'</p>

<p>They can also imitate DJ Jazzy Jeff by spinning on turntables, or simply try out a 'fly look' from a closet stocked with clothing inspired by Will's TV character.</p>

<p>Guests will be able to enjoy some highbrow culture with the elegant grand piano or try something more lowbrow with with a foosball table, as Will's character watches from the sidelines via a portrait on the wall.</p>

<p>Though guests have free range of the kitchen, they'll also be served regular meals in the elegant wood-paneled dining room and served on silver trays.</p>

<p>Helping out: Will doesn't own the mansion, but he's partnering with the owners to put a wing of the home on Airbnb for five nights in October at only $30 per night to mark the show's 30th anniversary</p>

<p>Decked out: Although Will and his costar didn't film inside the actual mansion, it has since been decorated as if his character live there</p>

<p>Although the air quality is currently poor due to wildfires raging near Los Angeles, guests will have the opportunity to lounge under the sun by the pool. </p>

<p>According to TMZ, Jeff will welcome guests virtually to the pool area if they want to relax outdoors. </p>

<p>Bookings for the mansion won't begin until September 29, and the home is only available on October 2, 5, 8, 11 and 14, so it will likely sell out almost immediately.</p>

<p>The home's owners are limiting stays to only a single night, and only LA County residents will be allowed to rent out the mansion.</p>

<p>Due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, any group with multiple people will also have to prove that they're currently living together so as not to increase the possibility of infection. </p>

<p>Big break: Will starred on the NBC comedy series for six seasons from 1990 to 1996; pictured with the cast of The Fresh Prince Of Bel Air</p>

<p>Extremely limited: Only five dates are being offered, so it will likely sell out immediately. Guests must live in LA County and need to prove they've been living together for coronavirus safety purposes; still from Fresh Prince</p>

<p>The listing also tries to ease potential renters' worries by clarifying that the wing of the mansion will be cleaned according to CDC recommendations between stays.</p>

<p>Potential renters can know that they're also doing a good deed by renting out the home, as Airbnb will make a one-time donation to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Philadelphia, where Will famously hails from.</p>

<p>Will recently sparked interest in a Fresh Prince reunion when he shared a screenshot of a chat with Janet Hubert, who played the original Aunt Vivian in the first three seasons.</p>

<p>She was later replaced for the last three seasons, and subsequently blamed her firing on Smith while vowing to never do a reunion for the show, but the two seem to have buried the hatchet since then.  </p>

<p>Reunited: Smith shared a shot of himself and Janet Hubert, who played Aunt Viv until she was replaced by Reed amid bad blood with Smith, suggesting they had buried the hatchet</p>

<p>Time flies: Will posed with the cast of the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in a group shot from the show's reunion to coincide with the 30th anniversary of the show originally airing</p>
