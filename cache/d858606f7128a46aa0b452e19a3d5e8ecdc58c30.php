<p>Chic: Kate Moss was putting on a sensational display as she stepped out in Mayfair while sporting a kooky ensemble on Thursday</p>

<p>Kate looked stunning in her elegant ensemble, as she added a touch of glamour with the gold running through the shirt and a sheer base. </p>

<p>Her blue skirt featured a nipped in waist and wife hem, with the girlishness of the skirt contrasting with the chic structured blazer.   </p>

<p>Kate returned to London last month after she had been isolating in her Cotswolds mansion with her daughter Lila, 17, alongside Kate's long-term partner Count Nikolai von Bismarck, 33, and her half-sister Lottie, 22.</p>

<p>The troupe were also joined by Kate's hairdresser friend James Brown. </p>

<p>A source told MailOnline: 'Kate and James have been friends their entire careers, they're like family. They're very comfortable living together.</p>

<p>'It's an added perk that James is a hairdresser and has been able to lend his hand when it comes to overgrown roots and out of control hair.</p>

<p>'Lottie, who's dyed her hair pink in lockdown, has also formed a close bond with James – and regularly shops with him when getting food for the house.'  </p>

<p>Lila burst onto the scene when she signed to her mother's agency and became the face of Marc Jacobs Beauty, after years out of the public eye,</p>

<p>'When I met Lila Moss for the first time in 2008, I was on a holiday in Ibiza and went to Formentera for the day to visit with her mom, Kate Moss, and other friends and family,' the designer said after announcing her addition to the books.</p>

<p>'At just six years old, Lila’s strong character, demeanour and great beauty was already very apparent. The next time I saw Lila was in August of 2011 at Kate’s wedding, her character was even more dynamic and her beauty even greater.'</p>

<p>Last November, she shot her first solo magazine cover for Dazed – which is owned by her father, Jefferson Hack.</p>

<p>In a previous interview with Allure, Lila revealed how she became involved in the modelling world.</p>

<p>'I think because I've seen it since I was so small it's always been an interest,' she said. </p>

<p>'When I did my first modelling shoot, I was like, "Yeah I enjoyed it. I want to do more." And I think it's worked out really well.'</p>

<p>Sister: She was also joined by her sister Lottie (pictured in the Cotswolds home) </p>
