<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The race to appeal to President Donald Trump's conservative base took an unexpected turn back 1,500 years as appointed Georgia Senator Kelly Loeffler cut a campaign ad that calls her more conservative than Attila the Hun.</p>

<p>The ad features a pair of Georgia voters discussing Loeffler including a ranking that calls her the 'most conservative senator in America.' </p>

<p>'Yep - she's more conservative than Attila the hun,' the man in what looks like a husband and wife pair responds. </p>

<p>A new ad by Sen. Kelly Loeffler calls her more conservative than Attila the Hun</p>

<p>The ad then cuts to a grunting Attila the hun seeking to bark orders at his scribe - with obvious comparisons to Trump's stances. </p>

<p>"Fight China -- got it," says the scribe. "Attack big government -- yeah."</p>

<p>"Eliminate the liberal scribes ... uh oh," he says, looking nervous at an attack with rings of Trump's slams on the 'fake news' media. </p>

<p>"More conservative than Attila the Hun,' says a narrator, as an image flashes of Loeffler seated with Trump aboard Air Force One. 'Kelly Loeffler: 100% Trump voting record,' it says. </p>

<p>'It's true,' Loeffler wrote as she tweeted out the light-hearted video. </p>

<p>The ad touts a '100 per cent Trump voting record' for Loeffler in the Senate</p>

<p>Loeffler was appointed to fill the seat of Sen. Johnny Isaakson, but must face the voters in her state's 'jungle primary' in November</p>

<p>The ad shows a couple discussing Loeffler's conservative record</p>

<p>Attila (406-453) burning townships during Invasion of Italy. (Attila on horseback, holding flame and sword.) Woodcut, undated.</p>

<p>The ad may have confused Attila, known by the Romans as the 'Scourge of God,' with Genghis Khan, whose Mongol warriors invaded China</p>

<p>The ad drew notice across political Washington Monday, then drew a brutal counter-attack from Collins, whose campaign didn't have to dig deep for the opposition research file on Attila the Hun, whose rule in the 400s terrorized the Romans and other ancient peoples across Europe and Asia.</p>

<p>'Fact Sheet: Attila the Hun,' Collins campaign wrote. 'Favored Post Natal Abortion. Killed Thousands of Christians. Pagan Religion. Polygamist.'</p>

<p>There was even more dirt in the Attila the Hun file. 'Nicknamed Scourge of the Gods by Romans for his Attrocities. Killed His Own Brother.'</p>

<p>The counter-stroke featured Loeffler's face plastered on a presumed painting of Attila.</p>

<p>Adding to the oddity of the ad, there are indications Loeffler's camp may have confused the historical figure with Genghis Khan, whose Mongol warriors lay waste to parts of China and other areas. </p>

<p>Georgia has a 'jungle primary' for the seat, pitting Loeffler against Collins, a conservative House Republican, as well as Democrats. If no candidate gets a majority, the race heads to a runoff.  </p>
