<p>In last night's episode, Laura Gallagher, of Northern Ireland, breezed through the first six questions before she was was asked: 'Which of these ITV daytime shows was first broadcast in 1988?' </p>

<p>She was given the options: 'A. Dickinson's Real Deal; B. GMTV; C. Loose Women; D. This Morning.' </p>

<p>PhD Psychology student appeared confident in her answer and quickly dismissed This Morning and Loose Women before adding: 'GMTV is the one that makes the most sense... I'm 90 per cent sure it's "B".' However she still asked to use the 50/50 lifeline</p>

<p>However she still decided to use the 50/50 lifeline and had two of the four answers eliminated, leaving her with GMTV and Loose Women. </p>

<p>The narrowing of the field gave Laura the boost she needed and she answered: 'Okay, easy. It's GMTV. Final answer.' </p>

<p>The first Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? winner in 14 years will be crowned tonight.</p>

<p>The winner, whose identity has not been revealed, is understood to be a man who answered the 15 questions to reach the jackpot in 'record time'. </p>

<p>Jeremy Clarkson has already described the winner as the 'best contestant ever' and said he or she 'whizzed through'.</p>

<p>The winner will be just the sixth millionaire to triumph on the ITV show since its launch in 1998.</p>

<p>But seconds later she was left with her head in her hands when presenter Jeremy Clarkson told her: 'It's the wrong answer'. </p>

<p>The shock on Laura's face was clear and she said, 'No! What?' Before the host admitted: 'I am struggling to think of anything to say to make you feel better. I'm so sorry.' </p>

<p>The moment left viewers at home frustrated, with one taking to Twitter to share: 'I knew it was This Morning! GMTV started in 1993, then Daybreak in 2010 and now Good Morning Britain started in 2014 and TV AM was from 1983 to 1992 #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Omg that girl then how did she just dismiss This Morning has she never heard of Richard and Judy #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire.'</p>

<p>A third added: 'It was #ThisMorning all day long. She should have phoned me Hugging face #WhoWantsToBeAMillionaire.' </p>

<p>Before leaving the show with £1,000, Laura answered six other questions on a range of topics. </p>
