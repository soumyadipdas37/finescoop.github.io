<p>Victorian Greens upper house MP Samantha Ratnam returned from maternity leave to vote for the government's amended bill during a marathon parliament session early on Wednesday morning</p>

<p>Daniel Andrews faced intense backlash over his original proposal of a 12-month extension to the state of emergency powers </p>

<p>The passed just before 2am on Wednesday in the Victorian Upper House, with 20 votes in favour and 19 against.</p>

<p>Reason Party MP Fiona Patten and Animal Justice Party MP Andy Meddick also voted in favour of the six-month extension, giving the government 20 votes in the 40-member upper house. </p>

<p>Mr Andrews initially proposed a 12-month extension of the government's State of Emergency, but was met with furious backlash from the public, civil rights groups and his political friends and foes.  </p>

<p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison directly asked Mr Andrews last week to reconsider his proposal and urged him to seek monthly or quarterly prolongments instead. </p>

<p>The State Opposition were unsuccessful in their push to have the State of Emergency powers extended on a month to month basis. </p>

<p>The State of Emergency powers allow Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton to impose restrictions including to wear masks or to stay at home. </p>

<p>The current state of emergency was due to expire on September 13, along with Melbourne's stage four lockdown and regional Victoria's stage three rules. </p>

<p>The amended bill is specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and includes additional transparency measures, Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said.</p>

<p>It comes as Victoria recorded five coronavirus deaths and 70 new cases on Tuesday, its lowest single-day increase in cases since July 3.</p>

<p>The current state of emergency was due to expire on September 13, along with Melbourne's stage four lockdown and regional Victoria's stage three rules</p>

<p>The state government on Sunday will release its plans to move both Melbourne and regional Victoria out of restrictions, noting they will be different.</p>

<p>Active case numbers outside of the capital have plummeted to 139.</p>

<p>'Given the low case numbers it will be possible for us to have different settings in regional Victoria, and a different timeline and road map compared to what will be essential in metropolitan Melbourne,' the premier said.</p>
