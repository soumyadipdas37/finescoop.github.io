<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A suspected paedophile killer was today arrested in Russia after two sisters aged eight and 13 were raped and murdered.</p>

<p>A massive manhunt had been underway in Rybinsk for Vitaly Molchanov, 41, a convicted sex attacker and killer who met the girls' mother on a dating app.</p>

<p>The suspect was found today hiding in bushes outside the city where he had been sleeping rough.</p>

<p>After being handcuffed in the long grass, he told police: 'At about 8pm I opened another bottle, and finished it at about 10pm. And... so to say... killed them.' </p>

<p>Vitaly Molchanov, 41, was arrested today over the rape and murder of two girls after a massive manhunt in Rybinsk</p>

<p>Divorcee nurse Valentina Saprunova, 40, had been living with Molchanov for only a  month when she came home from her hospital job to find the bloodbath.   </p>

<p>Sisters Elena and Yana Saprunova, eight and 13, were 'shredded' by a knife and the younger girl's body was dismembered, say law enforcement in a case that has shocked Russians.</p>

<p>Both girls had been raped, according to forensic evidence. </p>

<p>Molchanov was today being interrogated in the criminal investigation into the murder and rape of the two children. </p>

<p>Earlier police had released a chilling video showing the suspect walking out of his home in a red and black track suit as he 'went on the run'. </p>

<p>Saprunova has told police she had no idea of the seriousness of her lover's criminal record when they began a relationship.  </p>

<p>Saprunova's daughter Yana is pictured at a younger age. Saprunova, 40, came home from work and found her daughters 'literally shredded' by a knife</p>

<p>Valentina had uprooted 1,600 miles across the country to move in with Molchanov one month ago after they met on a dating app.</p>

<p>But reports say she was unaware of his past as a child murderer and sex attacker for which he had been jailed for almost a decade.</p>

<p>He had told her he was wrongly convicted but not admitted the seriousness of the offences.</p>

<p>She is now in the care of a police psychologist too distraught even to talk to her family.</p>

<p>Neighbours said that the couple had appeared 'madly in love'.</p>

<p>They were often seen holding hands and jogging together or riding bicycles.</p>

<p>After walking out of his block of flats, he was reported to have made away on a white bike.</p>

<p>Molchanov (pictured with the mother of his victims), 41, had prior convictions for child rape and murder and was released from a long prison sentence in 2010, according to reports </p>

<p>A chilling video shows the suspected paedophile killer fleeing his home after raping and knifing to death girls aged eight and 13</p>

<p>His previous 2010 conviction included murder, rape and desecration of the dead. He was also described as a 'convicted paedophile'.</p>

<p>The governor of Yaroslavl region, Dmitry Mironov had offered a £5,000 reward for information leading to Molchanov's detention.</p>

<p>Russia's children ombudsman Anna Kuznetsova called the killings 'inhuman'.</p>

<p>'No words to describe,' she said. 'A terrible crime. </p>

<p>'It is known that he was previously convicted of the rape and murder of a child. 'Now two more girls have become victims.'</p>

<p>She demanded more action from the Kremlin to tackle paedophiles including a register and 'supervision' for child sex attackers.</p>

<p>She has previously pleaded for paedophiles to be tagged for life and banned from using the internet.</p>

<p>'Children are dying, let's take these or other measures to protect children,' she said.</p>
