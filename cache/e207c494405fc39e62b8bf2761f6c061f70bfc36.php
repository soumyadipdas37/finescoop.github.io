<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Indian couple were forced to 'sell' their newborn baby to a hospital because they could not afford their medical bills, it is claimed. </p>

<p>Shiv Charan and his wife Babita were left with a bill of 35,000 rupees (£350) after their baby son was delivered by caesarian section at the hospital in Agra.</p>

<p>The rickshaw driver and his wife did not have the money - so the hospital 'bought' the child for 100,000 rupees (£1,000) to settle the bill, the parents told the Times of India.  </p>

<p>Hospital manager Seema Gupta says the child was 'given up' for adoption rather than 'sold', claiming that the parents signed paperwork agreeing to the move. </p>

<p>Shiv Charan and his wife Babita (pictured) were left with an unaffordable bill of 35,000 rupees (£350) after their baby son was born at a hospital in India </p>

<p>The couple already have five children and Mr Charan makes no more than 100 rupees per day driving rickshaws. </p>

<p>In addition, the shoe factory where their eldest son used to work has been closed because of the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>When the hospital demanded the money, the family could not afford to pay and the baby was taken away - but Babita, 36, wants her newborn son back. </p>

<p>Although the hospital claims that paperwork was completed, Mr Charan says the couple cannot read or write and that any documents were signed with thumb prints.</p>

<p>District magistrate Prahbu N Singh said the alleged 'sale' would be investigated and 'suitable action' taken. </p>

<p>Some babies who are taken into the hospital's care will later be 'sold' to couples looking to adopt a child, it is believed.  </p>

<p>A child rights activist told the Times of India that the alleged 'sale' had not met the legal requirements for adoption.  </p>

<p>India's government has previously warned of a 'baby trafficking' trade which reduces the number of children available for legitimate adoption. </p>

<p>The newborn baby (stock photo) was allegedly 'sold' to a hospital because its mother and father could not afford to pay for the caesarian section </p>

<p>Families have faced long waits to adopt a child, with willing parents outnumbering available children by as much as seven to one.  </p>

<p>Separately, India's Rajasthan this month launched a new drive to stop older children being trafficked across its borders for child labour. </p>

<p>The state is known for its handicraft industry and authorities are concerned about a rise in child labour as coronavirus restrictions are eased.  </p>

<p>It is illegal to employ anyone under 15 in India, but children are permitted to support family businesses outside of school hours.</p>

<p>Campaigners say this provision is widely exploited by employers and human traffickers.   </p>

<p>Police and transport officials have been told to verify the movement of every child to prevent the trafficking of child workers from poorer states.  </p>
