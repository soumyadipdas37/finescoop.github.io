<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>TV host Claudia Jordan claims she was dropped as part-owner of a wine brand because of her advocacy for causes against racial injustice.</p>

<p>The 47-year-old actress has filed a lawsuit against Biagio Cru and Estate Wines who she claims wrongfully fired her in late 2018 because she spoke out about unlawful police treatment of black people.</p>

<p>TV personality Claudia Jordan is suing wine company Biagio Cru after they fired her in 2018. She claims it was because of her speaking out about BLM</p>

<p>'Imagine losing ownership in a brand you were given a piece of because you spoke out AGAINST unarmed black folks getting murdered. Why does that offend you? We should ALL be outraged over it. #TimesUp' she wrote. </p>

<p>In response to a supportive fan who shared an article about the lawsuit, Claudia wrote: 'All I ever wanted to do was speak out against injustices against the very same people that supported the brand. </p>

<p>'Never in a million years would I think that would be a negative. Can't be ok with taking their money then NOT caring about that very same community. Not on my watch.' </p>

<p>'We should ALL be outraged': On Twitter on Monday the Sharknado 5: Global Swarming star sounded off about the issue</p>

<p>Speaking out: Claudia accused the company of not supporting the black community </p>

<p>In court documents obtained by TMZ, the former Real Housewives of Atlanta star says she entered an agreement with the wine company in 2016 to promote sparkling wine Just Peachy.</p>

<p>In return she would get 3% ownership of the brand and 3% of all the profit. </p>

<p>Claudia says the campaign, which kicked off in 2017, was a huge success with sales dramatically increasing because of her involvement.</p>

<p>The Rhode Island born star also claims she was involved in the strategy and marketing and the brand became synonymous with her name.</p>

<p>Despite the success, Claudia claims Biagio stopped paying her in late 2018.</p>

<p>In court documents obtained by TMZ , Claudia says she entered an agreement with the wine company in 2016 to promote sparkling wine Just Peachy. In return she would get 3% ownership of the brand and 3% of all the profit</p>

<p>She accuses the company of trying to terminate the contract because of her support for Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>She alleges that Biagio commented that her opinions on social media were 'too slanted.'</p>

<p>Biagio allegedly stopped sending her financial statements in 2018 and the former Love &amp; Hip Hop: Miami host accuses them of continuing to use her association to Just Peachy to its advantage. </p>

<p>She says Biagio denies it struck a deal giving her ownership. </p>

<p>TMZ reports she is suing for breach of contract and is seeking an unspecified sum in damages.</p>

<p>Biagio Cru responded to Claudia's claims saying it parted ways with the reality star for 'legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons; namely, dissatisfaction with Ms. Jordan’s ability to boost sales in relevant markets'</p>

<p>They added that they will 'vigorously defend against the false claims asserted by Ms. Jordan and will pursue any and all appropriate legal actions associated with false and defamatory statements published by Ms. Jordan.'</p>
