<p>The WikiLeaks founder is fighting being sent to the US on charges relating to leaks of classified documents allegedly exposing war crimes and abuse.</p>

<p>His defence has claimed the move is politically motivated under President Donald Trump, after the previous Obama administration failed to bring charges despite launching an investigation. </p>

<p>Edward Fitzgerald QC, for Assange, today asked for time to prepare his closing arguments in the case, following the close of evidence next week.</p>

<p>A decision on whether Julian Assange (pictured) will be extradited to the States will not be made until after the US election, a judge has said</p>

<p>He said it would take a 'dramatic' development such as Mr Trump declaring 'we will execute all journalists', for him to reopen his case.</p>

<p>Mr Fitzgerald told judge Vanessa Baraitser: 'Evidently it seems unlikely we will be able to get judgment before November 4 even if you were able to get our submissions.</p>

<p>'You have to bear in mind there is an election and the future is uncertain.'</p>

<p>He said there were some elements of the defence case which related to the Trump presidency, saying it 'would be worse if Mr Trump was there'.</p>

<p>He added: 'We are dealing with real risks.'</p>

<p>Assange is fighting extradition back to the US in a hearing being held at the Old Bailey</p>

<p>His defence has claimed the move is politically motivated under President Donald Trump, after the previous Obama administration failed to bring charges despite launching an investigation</p>

<p>On the timing of the decision, Judge Baraitser responded: 'I agree with you, one way or another my decision is likely to go after the election in the US.'</p>

<p>She gave the defence four weeks to prepare written closing submissions, with the US Government a further two weeks.</p>

<p>The judge said she would be able to set a date for her final judgment at the end of next week.</p>

<p>Father-of-two Assange, 49, faces an 18-count indictment alleging a plot to hack computers and conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information.   </p>

<p>His extradition case at the Old Bailey continues.</p>
