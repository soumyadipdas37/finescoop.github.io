<p>Disagreement: Chloe Brockett and Frankie Sims (pictured) are set to engage in a very tense showdown over rumours of Chloe and Harry Lee's 'flirty' behaviour in Wednesday's TOWIE</p>

<p>Clearly agitated while trying to defend her relationship with the footballer, Frankie says to Chloe: 'He's good to me, I ain't insecure and he don't control me, so don't put words into my relationship.' </p>

<p>The girls have been at loggerheads ever since Frankie and Harry embarked on their romance earlier this year, after Chloe also briefly dated him before Christmas.</p>

<p>In Wednesday's episode Harry also tries to diffuse any tension and reassures Frankie that he was not flirting with Chloe and he 'can't believe she would even suggest it'. </p>

<p>Tense: In an teaser for the upcoming episode on Wednesday night Chloe, 19, finally comes face-to-face with Frankie, 25, to get to the bottom of what happened that night</p>

<p>It comes after Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 19, came under fire once again on Sunday's TOWIE, as they were hit with more accusations of bullying Chloe. </p>

<p>Viewers took to Twitter to describe how they felt 'uncomfortable' watching the trio throw insults at their much younger cast mate.</p>

<p>The row first occurred when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex boyfriend, Jack McDermott.  </p>

<p>Awkward: The girls have been at loggerheads ever since Frankie and Harry (pictured) embarked on their romance earlier this year, after Chloe also briefly dated him before Christmas</p>

<p>During the row, insults were thrown by both Chloe and mainly Olivia as Yazmin Oukhellou watched awkwardly on the sidelines. </p>

<p>When Chloe asked Olivia why she called her a 'poisonous little creature', the former Love Island star replied: 'I thought you was vile and poisonous. You went at Clelia last year like a Jack Russell.</p>

<p>'I do feel a bit sorry for you, you haven't got any friends your own age, you're hanging around girls a lot older than you and you're angry. I don't know why you're so angry but you are. </p>

<p>'The thing is I thought the other day "maybe was what I said a little bit too harsh" but the way you've conducted yourself, I'm bang on.'</p>

<p>'Three witches': It comes after Olivia Attwood, 29, Nicole Bass, 28, and Clelia Theodorou, 19, came under fire once again on Sunday's TOWIE, as they were hit with more accusations of bullying Chloe</p>

<p>Chloe told her: 'All I'm saying is, when you called me a 'poisonous little creature', you don't know me'.</p>

<p>Olivia interrupted: 'I do know you, I know loads about you. I've seen the way you treated my friend.  </p>

<p>'Your mum Claire what does she pay you an hour to babysit you? Because I would like to know', to which the other two girls sniggered.   </p>

<p>The argument reached fever pitch when they continued to throw insults about each others' age, Chloe calling Olivia a 'lanky old troll' while Nicole called Chloe 'young' and 'stupid'. </p>

<p>Olivia went further: 'You come here with Victoria Beckham's wig on'.</p>

<p>Upsetting scenes: Viewers took to Twitter to describe how they felt 'uncomfortable' watching the trio throw insults at their much younger castmate Chloe</p>

<p>Viewers were outraged by the scenes. One wrote: 'This is three on one, and that’s disgusting promoting bullying behaviour regardless to if Chloe B is in the right or the wrong. Three people are attacking her I don’t blame her for reacting the way she does.'  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted ITV and Olivia, Nicole and Clelia's representatives for comment.   </p>

<p>Earlier this week, Chloe addressed bullying claims on Twitter, after fans raised their concerns. </p>

<p>Having their say: The row first occurred when the group waded into a row between Chloe and Ella-Rae Wise, after she had slept with her former BFF's ex boyfriend, Jack McDermott</p>

<p>The reality star wrote: 'I know there's a lot of talk atm about me being bullied, I appreciate everyone's concern, however this is a show and everyone is entitled to their own opinions and I am completely FINE. Towie would not allow bullying to go on and always put our welfare first.' </p>

<p>Elsewhere on the upcoming episode Clelia is left frustrated with Bobby Norris after comments he made towards her while Saffron acts as a mediator to try and bring the pair back together. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Olivia Attwood contemplates her future in Essex as she considers moving back to Manchester full-time to be closer to her fiance Bradley Dack. </p>
