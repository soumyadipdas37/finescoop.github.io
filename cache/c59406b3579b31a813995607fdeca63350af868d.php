<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lizzie Cundy flirted up a storm with a farmer on Thursday when she asked him for directions after getting lost in the countryside in Hampshire. </p>

<p>The 52-year-old soon had a smile on her face when she stepped out of her new white Mercedes in a bid to ask for assistance. </p>

<p>And she was in luck, when a tractor-driving hero stepped in to help the damsel in distress. </p>

<p>Sowing The Seeds Of Love: Lizzie Cundy flirted outrageously with a farmer when she got lost in the countryside in Hampshire wearing sexy red leather trousers om Thursday</p>

<p>Which way? She needn't have worried about being lost because a tractor-driving hero stepped in to help the damsel in distress</p>

<p>With a big smile on her face, Lizzie was dressed to the nines for her outing, wearing spray-on red leather trousers. </p>

<p>She teamed it with a form-fitting matching red polka dot top which flashed a hint of her bra. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two was sporting lightened Farrah Fawcett-style waves which she had dyed herself while in lockdown. </p>

<p>Oh dear: Lizzie had been cruising along in her new Mercedes convertible when she came a cropper</p>

<p>I'm running late: She took a call on her phone, no doubt telling her pals she wouldn't be too much longer</p>

<p>But sadly, it looked as though Lizzie had left her wellies at home and she tottered along in gold killer heels instead.  </p>

<p>Lizzie was forced to cancel her usual lavish plans for her birthday as she marked her 52nd during lockdown in May. </p>

<p>However in true Lizzie style, she promised a huge party once life returns to normal with the proceeds from the bash going to the National Health Service.</p>

<p>Are you from round here? Lizzie had a big smile on her face as she posed up a storm while talking to the farmer </p>

<p>Turn left: The farmer was more than happy to help Lizzie out </p>

<p>Walking tall: She looked picture perfect as she posed with her hands on her hips</p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: I really want to give back and say thank you to the NHS as they have been so incredible and I’m so thankful to have got through the coronavirus myself</p>

<p>'I’m so sad not to be with my family and friends and especially be with my son on my special day but know we will all be together soon...</p>

<p>'Good times are in their way ! I want my party to be the biggest fund raiser for the NHS to give thanks!'</p>
