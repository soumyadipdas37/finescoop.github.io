<p>As reported by Cadena Ser, City are eager for Messi to help them fulfil their longstanding ambition of winning the Champions League.</p>

<p>The same publication report that City's director of football Txiki Begiristain is already in Barcelona in an attempt to strike a deal for Messi. </p>

<p>Manchester City will offer Lionel Messi a two year contract if they can strike a deal to sign him</p>

<p>Reuniting with his former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola would certainly be appealing to Messi, but there is still much work for City to do in order to sign him.</p>

<p>If they were able to sign Messi, City would be open to extending his contract beyond the initial two years.  </p>

<p>Messi remains in a dispute with Barcelona and failed to turn up for the first two days of pre-season as he looks to secure a move away from the club.</p>

<p>The opportunity to reunite with Pep Guardiola at City is appealing to the Argentina star</p>

<p>Manchester City's director of football Txiki Begiristain is reportedly already in Barcelona</p>

<p>The 33-year-old felt that he was free to leave due to a clause in his contract, but LaLiga stated that Messi is still a Barcelona player, with his contract running until June 30, 2021, and any club wishing to sign him must pay his release clause of £630m (£700m).  </p>

<p>Messi is facing the prospect of a £1.1m fine and a suspension after missing the start of Barcelona's pre-season preparations.  </p>

<p>His father Jorge is set to meet with the Barcelona board this week in an attempt to resolve the situation. </p>
