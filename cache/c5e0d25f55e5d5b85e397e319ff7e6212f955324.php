<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mother of Kenosha gunman Kyle Rittenhouse was given a 'standing ovation' at a GOP event in Wisconsin as her son fights extradition to the state where he is charged with shooting dead two protesters.</p>

<p>Wendy Rittenhouse received a warm welcome at a meeting hosted by The Republican Women of Waukesha County in Pewaukee on Thursday. </p>

<p>Conservative commentator and blogger Michelle Malkin, who attended the event, shared a photo on Twitter alongside the teenager's mother and her legal team. </p>

<p>'Standing ovation from Waukesha County GOP women for my special guests, [John Pierce] &amp; Wendy Rittenhouse, Kyle's mom,' she tweeted. </p>

<p>'Huge shoutout sent from all of us in WI to warrior [Lin Wood]. I was able to talk to Kyle by phone &amp; THANK HIM for his courage!'</p>

<p>Rittenhouse, 17, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide for killing two protesters, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, during a night of unrest in Kenosha on August 25. </p>

<p>He is also charged with wounding a third demonstrator, Gaige Grosskreutz.  </p>

<p>His attorneys have said Rittenhouse acted in self-defense and have portrayed him as a courageous patriot who was exercising his right to bear arms during a night of protests over the police shooting of black man Jacob Blake.  </p>

<p>Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, participated in a hearing on Friday at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois via video link from the detention facility where he is being held</p>

<p>Wendy was applauded by guests after she was introduced at Thursday's event however, the president of the women's GOP group said she was not formally invited by the organization.  </p>

<p>Nancy Kormanik told Patch Wendy had attended the meeting after Malkin, who had interviewed her earlier, brought her as a guest.</p>

<p>The attendees had gathered for an event focused on 'safety and self-defense', according to the news outlet.</p>

<p>Malkin's tweet was met with backlash from some users who criticized her for praising a 'killer' and a 'criminal.' </p>

<p>'This is truly a sick world that this kid is being celebrated and his parents are proud,' Twitter user Michael Fabus said. </p>

<p>'Applauding a killer. That's deranged,' another tweeted in response.  </p>

<p>Rittenhouse, who was arrested in his hometown of Antioch, participated in a virtual hearing on Friday at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois from the detention facility where he is being held. </p>

<p>Lawyer John Pierce told the judge he planned to fight the request by Kenosha prosecutors that Rittenhouse be transferred to Wisconsin to face charges. </p>

<p>The judge, Paul Novak, gave 14 days for the defense to review papers and file pleadings ahead of an October 9 hearing. </p>

<p>Pierce asked for a month to prepare arguments challenging extradition that he said involve 'issues of some complexity, frankly that have not arisen in the country for some time'.</p>

<p>'We intend to challenge extradition by writ of habeas corpus,' Pierce said. </p>

<p>He didn't provide further details at the hearing about the basis for the challenge. </p>

<p>Novak granted two weeks to prepare those arguments. The delay in returning Rittenhouse to Wisconsin is the second in the case. </p>
