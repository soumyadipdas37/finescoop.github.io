<p>Brain freeze! Today host Karl Stefanovic bravely took part in an ice bath challenge live on the Today show on Friday</p>

<p>Ally put on a wetsuit for the challenge, likely hoping the extra layer of fabric would give her an advantage over Karl.</p>

<p>Karl dared to test his tolerance in the cold by wearing a pair of red budgie smugglers. </p>

<p>As he climbed up the small ladder to get into the tub, the TV host boldly showed off his derrière to Ally, possibly in a bid to distract her.</p>

<p>She complained: 'Did anyone tell Karl not to wear pants?' </p>

<p>As Karl desperately tried to get her attention, Ally defiantly told her co-host: 'I'm not looking!'</p>

<p>Entertainment reporter Brooke Boney then approached the tubs and handed them each a small cup each of ice cream, forcing them to eat the extra icy dessert. </p>

<p>Ally was visibly shivering and even threw out scoops of hers in a bid to get ahead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Karl who was initially shocked by the cold, appeared unfazed by the icy water as he enjoyed his sweet treat. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, Ally's tactic of scooping out her ice cream was noticed by the producers and she was disqualified.</p>

<p>'This sucks! Everything about this sucks! You suck. And you all suck. Even you suck Charlie,' she joked as she splashed the cold water on her co-hosts and Dr Teo.</p>

<p>Earlier in the Segment, Dr Teo said he hoped his Charlie Teo Foundation could raise awareness about brain cancer by encouraging others to take part in the challenge and share it on social media. </p>

<p>'With COVID and lockdown a lot of people are forgetting that people are still suffering with brain cancer and there are people suffering out there are people suffering out there, apart from COVID,' he said.</p>

<p>'It is a lot of fun and we are asking people to get into the spirit and challenge someone else to do the Brain Freeze as well.'</p>
