<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham's Son Heung-Min produced a stunning goal-line clearance to prevent Watford defender Marc Navarro from scoring in their final match of pre-season on Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>Son appeared to have little chance of stopping Navarro from finding the net after goalkeeper Paolo Gazzaniga went up for a 90th minute corner, but the Korean International raced back before making an excellent challenge.</p>

<p>Son's impressive clearance was not enough to stop Tottenham from losing 2-1 at Vicarage Road but fans were quick to praise the forward's efforts. </p>

<p>Watford defender Navarro picked up the ball just over the halfway line and laced one towards the empty goal. </p>

<p>Son - who was wearing the captain's armband for the first time due to players missing on international duty - raced back from inside Watford's half to clear the ball off the line. </p>

<p>Supporters took to Twitter to laud Son for covering over half a pitch to prevent Watford from scoring another goal in a 'pointless friendly'. </p>

<p>One fan wrote: 'That goal line clearance by Son was incredible. Last second in a pointless friendly he sprinted back to do it I respect it' </p>

<p>While another added: 'Son deserves man of the match for that clearance.'  </p>

<p>However, Son's impressive clearance did not stop Tottenham from losing 2-1 at Vicarage Road</p>

<p>Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho was also impressed with Son's effort, telling the official Spurs website: 'I would say that those are the positives, players who needed minutes had them, some players played 90 minutes.</p>

<p>I really liked the fact that in the last minute, we are fighting to try to score, and then Sonny makes a 100-metre sprint to stop the 3-1 on the counter-attack.'</p>

<p>With the Premier League starting next weekend, Tottenham will take on Everton at home on Sunday.  </p>
