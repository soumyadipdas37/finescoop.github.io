<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rush hour congestion in London has dropped by five percent compared to last week in a sign commuters are choosing to work from home amid a rise in infections that has prompted London Mayor Sadiq Khan to push for a new lockdown.</p>

<p>Roads in the capital were 36% congested at 7am this morning compared to 41% last week, according to TomTom data. </p>

<p>Ministers will decide today whether to impose a lockdown on London, with the mayor pressing for regional lockdown restrictions - including a 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants - to cover the capital as well. </p>

<p>Mr Khan believes the city is just days behind the disease hotspots in the North West and North East of England and said a new lockdown is 'increasingly likely'.</p>

<p>But London's infection rate of 25 cases per 100,000 people is significantly lower than the national average of 34 and no areas of the capital are on Public Health England's 'watchlist'.</p>

<p>It comes as Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty is set to deliver a televised address warning that Britain is in the grip of a second wave and will face a 'very challenging winter period'.  </p>

<p>Canary Wharf - the city's second financial centre - was quiet this morning as office workers continued to stay away </p>

<p>Commuters - many wearing masks - walk across London Bridge into the City this morning</p>

<p>Mr Khan is now meeting council leaders after urging ministers to extend the latest lockdown restrictions - including a 10pm curfew for bars and restaurants - to cover the capital as well</p>

<p>Sadiq Khan will meet local council leaders today, with any local lockdown proposals recommended to ministers afterwards.</p>

<p>His spokesman told The Standard: 'The situation is clearly worsening. The mayor wants fast action as we cannot risk a delay, as happened in March.'</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he had spoken with Mr Khan over the weekend about what action is needed in the capital.</p>

<p>Asked if London office employees could be advised to work from home from some point next week, Mr Hancock told Times Radio: 'Well, I wouldn't rule it out.'</p>

<p>Such a move would be in contrast to the Government's recent messaging, which has been urging people to get back to their offices following the easing of restrictions. </p>

<p>But a rise in cases has forced ministers to reverse measures to reopen the economy. </p>

<p>Today, Chris Medical Officer Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, are set to issue a warning that the nation is in the grip of a second wave.</p>

<p>In an unprecedented move, the duo will address the nation without a minister beside them, and will say that a wave of new hospital admissions and deaths are on the horizon if the rules are not followed.   </p>

<p>Professor Whitty will say in the address set to start at 11am: 'The trend in the UK is heading in the wrong direction and we are at a critical point in the pandemic.</p>

<p>'We are looking at the data to see how to manage the spread of the virus ahead of a very challenging winter period.'   </p>

<p>A quiet London Tube station this morning, amid warnings the capital could see new lockdown measures </p>

<p>Roads in the capital were 36% congested at 7am this morning compared to 41% last week, according to TomTom data</p>

<p>Yesterday, Mr Hancock was asked on Sky News about comments from Mr Khan that restrictions in the capital were increasingly likely.</p>

<p>He said: 'I've had discussions this week with the Mayor of London, and the teams are meeting today to discuss further what might be needed.' </p>

<p>A mayoral source told HuffPost: 'It's clear that cases in London are only moving in one direction, we are now just days behind hotspots in the North West and North East. We can't afford more delay.</p>

<p>'Introducing new measures now will help slow the spread of the virus and potentially prevent the need for a fuller lockdown like we saw in March, which could seriously damage the economy once again.' </p>

<p>He is also said to be looking at the possibility of asking those who are able to work from home to do so.</p>

<p>There has been a toughening up of government rhetoric over Covid in recent days amid an upsurge in infections. </p>

<p>People in England who refuse an order to self-isolate could now face fines of up to £10,000. </p>

<p>Ministers will impose a new legal duty on people to self-isolate if they test positive or are told to do so by NHS Test and Trace after coming into contact with someone with the virus.</p>

<p>Those on lower incomes who face a loss of earnings as a result of going into quarantine will be eligible for a one-off support payment of £500 to help them cope financially.</p>

<p>With new cases of the infection doubling every week, Boris Johnson said the measures were necessary to control the spread of the virus and to protect the most vulnerable from becoming infected.</p>

<p>However they are likely to alarm some Conservative MPs already concerned at the wide-ranging powers being taken by ministers to curb the disease with little or no debate in Parliament.</p>

<p>The new regulations will come into force in England on September 28, although ministers are in discussion with the devolved administrations for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland about extending them UK-wide.</p>

<p>The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has tonight admitted it is 'increasingly likely' that lockdown restrictions will soon be needed to slow the spread of coronavirus in the capital</p>

<p>The ONS said today London and the North West were the areas that appeared to have highest infection rates, based on swabbing of random people in private households - a better indication of where the outbreak is occurring</p>

<p>It follows a warning by Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London - whose modelling led to the original nationwide lockdown, that the authorities needed to act 'sooner rather than later' if they were to avoid a return to the infection rates of last March.</p>

<p>Ministers are still looking at further restrictions, including a temporary two or three-week 'circuit break' in an attempt to break the chain of transmission.</p>

<p>The move could see pubs and restaurants ordered to close or face a 10pm curfew, while socialising between households could be banned.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Prime Minister acknowledged the long-feared second wave of the pandemic affecting countries such as France and Spain had reached Britain and that more cases of the disease were 'inevitable'.</p>

<p>Announcing the new rules, Mr Johnson said: 'The best way we can fight this virus is by everyone following the rules and self-isolating if they're at risk of passing on coronavirus.</p>

<p>'And so nobody underestimates just how important this is, new regulations will mean you are legally obliged to do so if you have the virus or have been asked to do so by NHS Test and Trace.</p>

<p>'People who choose to ignore the rules will face significant fines. We need to do all we can to control the spread of this virus, to prevent the most vulnerable people from becoming infected, and to protect the NHS and save lives.'</p>

<p>Fines will initially start at £1,000 rising to £10,000 for repeat offenders and for 'the most egregious breaches' including those who stop other people from self-isolating, such an employer who requires a staff member to come into work in violation of an order.</p>

<p>How regions' cases per 100,000 compare. London's is showing an uptick along with the North East and North West. The graphs come from Public Health England's surveillance report, published today</p>

<p>The penalties are in line with those for people who fail to quarantine for 14 days after returning to the UK from a country not on the list of low risk nations.</p>

<p>Officials said NHS Test and Trace would be in regular contact with individuals told to self-isolate and would report any suspicions that people were not complying to the police and local authorities.</p>

<p>Police will also check compliance in Covid-19 hotspots and among groups considered to be 'high-risk' as well as following up reports from members of the public of people who have tested positive but are not self-isolating.</p>

<p>Prosecutions could follow in 'high-profile and egregious' cases of non-compliance.</p>

<p>As with other coronavirus rules, there will be specific exemptions for those who need to escape from illness or harm during their isolation, and for those who require care.</p>

<p>Officials said just under four million people on benefits in England would be eligible for the support payments if they lose income as a result of being unable to go into work.</p>

<p>For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds welcomed the 'belated' announcement of additional financial assistance.</p>

<p>'It shouldn't have taken months for the penny to finally drop that people on low incomes needed more help,' she said.</p>

<p>The latest announcement comes just days after the 'rule of six' - banning social gatherings of more than six people - came into force and will been seen as further evidence of the concern in Whitehall at the rate of spread of the disease.</p>

<p>On Friday, the Government announced tough new restrictions were being imposed in large parts of England's North West, West Yorkshire and the Midlands.</p>

<p>It means by Tuesday, when the measures come into force, around 13.5 million people in the UK will be living under some form of additional coronavirus controls.</p>

<p>Prof Ferguson said the country was caught in a 'perfect storm' following the easing of lockdown restrictions over the summer, and that swift action was needed to stop the virus spreading out of control.</p>

<p>'Right now we are at about the levels of infection we were seeing in this country in late February,' he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme.</p>

<p>'If we leave it another two to four weeks we will be back at levels we were seeing more like mid-March. That's clearly going to cause deaths because people will be hospitalised.</p>

<p>'I think some additional measures are likely to be needed sooner rather than later.'          </p>
