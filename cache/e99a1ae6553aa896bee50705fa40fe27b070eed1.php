<p>'I was devastated, I was so upset,' Lewis said of the breakup.</p>

<p>The real estate speculator then opened up about their relationship and said they hadn't been speaking to each other for two weeks, which culminated in Anderson agreeing to visit him at home last week. </p>

<p>'He was very distant, kind of emotionally removed,' Lewis said, though there was initially hope of a reconciliation after they had dinner and spent time together and even 'hooked up a little bit.'</p>

<p>But he realized something was amiss when Anderson divulged that he had signed a new lease on a nearby apartment. </p>

<p>Something's amiss: The couple hadn't been talking for two weeks, but Anderson came over last week. 'He was very distant, kind of emotionally removed,' Lewis said</p>

<p>'I was a little thrown by the fact that he committed to a year lease when he was just living with me 11 days ago,' Lewis said.</p>

<p>The radio hot remembered thinking, 'I don't think I'm going to see him again,' as he walked Anderson out to his car after he decided to leave early.</p>

<p>Lewis said the two planned to spend time together the following day, but he received a text from Anderson in the morning: 'I had a really nice time, but this is too much for me.' </p>

<p>The split seemed to be official after people started messaging the TV star to let him know that his ex was on dating apps again.</p>

<p>'I started getting screenshots. Apparently, he was on Tinder,' Lewis said. 'So I was very upset.'</p>

<p>Likely story: Lewis later learned that Anderson was on dating apps, though he claimed to have only logged in to see if a friend's ex was on the app </p>

<p>Waiting to see: Lewis chose to believe his ex, though he wasn't sure if they would be getting back together or would stay broken up</p>

<p>Despite his boyfriend seemingly moving on, Lewis still had hope of resuscitating the relationship.</p>

<p>After confronting Anderson about the dating profile, he claimed that he had logged in to help a friend find out if their ex was on the dating app, and he said he wasn't actively trying to meet people.</p>

<p>Despite the suspicious circumstances, Lewis said he was choosing to believe Anderson. </p>

<p>'Everything has been said. I feel like it’s very civil, it’s very friendly,' Lewis continued. 'Is it over? Don’t know. But I have to move on with my life now, and he needs space anyways. He needs to think about what he wants, and does this life work for him.'</p>

<p>Regardless of what happens with the relationship in the future, the interior designer said he was 'going to lay low' for the time being and wouldn't be dating.</p>

<p>New couple: The two were first an item back in March 2019, but they didn't publicize their relationship until appearing on Instagram together in August of that year</p>

<p>The two welcomed their daughter Monroe, three, via surrogate in 2016. </p>
