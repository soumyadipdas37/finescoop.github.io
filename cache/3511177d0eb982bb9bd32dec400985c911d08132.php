<p>The injured man sought refuge in a shop across the road after the incident late on Saturday afternoon. Paramedics treated him at the scene before he was taken to hospital.</p>

<p>It is believed he was being held against his will at the house after being forced to leave another address in Cleethorpes earlier on Saturday.</p>

<p>The image, caught by a shocked passer-by, shows the man naked near the Lifestyle Express corner shop on the corner of Convamore Road and Ropery Street.</p>

<p>His left lower arm is hidden by his body but in his right hand he appears to be carrying something, which is also shown in the shadow cast on the ground.</p>

<p>There are reports he had been beaten in the house, possibly by two men, before he managed to escape by throwing himself through the window.</p>
