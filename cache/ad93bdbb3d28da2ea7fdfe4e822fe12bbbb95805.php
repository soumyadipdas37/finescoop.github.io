<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The sister of an AFL star has been jailed after bashing and mugging an elderly woman while on bail for holding up a liquor store with a pair of scissors. </p>

<p>Sally-Anne Powell-Pepper, 23, whose brother Sam plays for Port Adelaide, was sentenced to three years in prison at Perth's District Court this week over a series of brazen robberies.  </p>

<p>The court heard how the mum-of-three's first offence occurred in November last year when she stole ten cans of bourbon from a Bayswater liquor store, The West Australian reported.  </p>

<p>After plucking the items from a fridge, she walked out of the store without paying. </p>

<p>Sally-Anne Powell-Pepper (pictured), 23, has been jailed for three years after a series of brazen robberies in Perth</p>

<p>Staff workers rushed after, at which point she produced a pair of scissors and threatened to stab them.</p>

<p>Powell-Pepper then fled the scene but was arrested a short time later by police who found her in a bus stop with the booze, valued at just over $51. </p>

<p>Officers seized scissors and a knife were in her possession. </p>

<p>The second altercation occurred just three months later, on January 9, when she assaulted an elderly woman in an East Perth car park.</p>

<p>After watching the woman struggle with her shopping, the court heard how Powell-Pepper followed her to her car then punched her in the head.</p>

<p>She demanded the woman give her the handbag, and the woman offered up the money in her wallet instead. </p>

<p>Unsatisfied with the woman's offer, Powell-Pepper hit her again, then took of with her handbag and shopping. </p>

<p>The attack occurred hours after Powell-Pepper had faced court over the first theft. </p>

<p>She was arrested months later and confessed to the crime. </p>

<p>In court earlier this year, Judge Ronald Birmingham described the offender as 'disgraceful' and 'thuggish'. </p>
