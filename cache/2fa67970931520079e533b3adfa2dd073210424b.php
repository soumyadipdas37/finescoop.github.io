<p>The comedian, 44, explained how he visited the Mayr clinic in Austria with his friend Paul Tonkinson in February 2017.</p>

<p>Extreme: Michael McIntyre has revealed how he lost one-stone in just six days after visiting an Austrian retreat in 2017 with a pal (pictured after the trip in 2018)</p>

<p>He said: 'You drink the Epsom salts first thing and then within 20 minutes, the whole of the clinic – which is full of wealthy fat people – are all rushing to the lavatory.</p>

<p>'I lost a stone – we were only there six days. I was so emotional, depressed and confused and Paul was skeletal.' </p>

<p>Revealing more about the stay, Michael said he and Paul decided to leave early after his pal 'nearly died' following an incident which was 'a bit grim and cleared them out' during a hike.    </p>

<p>Not so fun: The comedian revealed that he only ate soup and crackers and drank epsom salts during the stay (pictured before the visit in 2011) </p>

<p>It comes after Michael left Phillip Schofield mortified on Wednesday's episode of This Morning after he got him in trouble and asked about his new book.</p>

<p>The comedian appeared on the hit ITV series to discuss his new Netflix special show when chat soon turned to Phillip, 58.</p>

<p>At the end of the interview, Michael decided to grill Phillip where he asked about his new autobiography book Life's What You Make It. </p>

<p>Awkward! It comes after Michael left Phillip Schofield mortified on Wednesday's episode of This Morning after he got him in trouble and asked about his new book</p>

<p>To which the host was left mortified with co-presenter Holly Willoughby left equally shocked by the questions.</p>

<p>Michael said: 'Are you busy Phil? Aren't you writing a book, Phil?' </p>

<p>To which a coy and giggling Phillip replied: 'Yeah, I've done that... it's all done, all finished.'</p>

<p>Cheeky: He appeared on the hit ITV series to discuss his new Netflix special show when chat soon turned to Phillip, 58</p>

<p>Michael then asked when the book was being released to which Phillip shared: 'October 15th... I don't think I'm allowed to say, we're not allowed to talk about my stuff!' </p>

<p>Holly was left equally shocked as she squealed: 'Michael McIntyre!' then added: 'You are going to be in trouble now!' </p>

<p>And as This Morning ended, it showed a visibly mortified Phillip clutch his hand in his face while Holly laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>Tables have turned: At the end of the interview, Michael decided to grill Phillip where he asked about his new autobiography book Life's What You Make It</p>
