<p>Hurricane Sandy is the second most powerful hurricane in modern history, with its might exceeding even that of Katrina, according to a measurement of the hurricane's strength in relation to its size.</p>

<p>Researchers have found that Sandy's Integrated Kinetic Energy index, or IKE, which quantifies the power of a hurricane based on how far out tropical-storm force winds extend from the center, ranked second only to Hurricane Isabel in 2003.</p>

<p>Hurricane Sandy's IKE was 140 Terajoules, which was about 20 Terajoules higher than Katrina's, according to Brian McNoldy, a senior researcher at the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marin and Atmospheric Science.</p>

<p>Record-setting storm: Hurricane Sandy was more powerful than Katrina, but its might was more spread out, researchers say</p>

<p>'Sandy's IKE was over 140 Terajoules (TJ, 1 TJ = 1 trillion Joules = 277,778 kilowatt hours), meaning it generated more than twice the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb,' McNoldy wrote on a blog published by the Washington Post.</p>

<p>'At any given moment, many hurricanes contain more energy than an atomic bomb in their surface winds alone (even excluding winds at higher elevations and latent heat energy),' he added.</p>

<p>The category levels that are more widely cited to quantify the power of hurricanes purely measure wind speed. Katrina was measured as a Category 3 hurricane at landfall and later rose to a Category 5.</p>

<p>The estimated cost of Hurricane Sandy is $20 billion</p>

<p>Sandy, meanwhile, was measured as a Category 1 hurricane at landfall.</p>

<p>But Sandy may end up being the second costliest hurricane in history after Katrina because of its high IKE, McNoldy noted. </p>

<p>'Sandy had Category 1 winds at landfall yet was able to create very significant storm surge over hundreds of miles of highly populated coastline,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'Katrina's IKE was more concentrated, Sandy's IKE was more spread out. This metric -- more than wind speed -- encapsulates the respective storms' horrific effects.'</p>

<p>Sandy has been estimated to cost at least $20 billion in damage, whereas Katrina cost roughly $106 billion.</p>
