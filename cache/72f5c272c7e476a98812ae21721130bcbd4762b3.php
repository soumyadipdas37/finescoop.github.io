<p>Amazon Prime Day 2020 will be a 48-hour event featuring more than one million deals</p>

<p>With so many Prime Day deals to choose from, plus competitive retailers crashing the party with their own sales, preparation is key to avoid losing sight of how much you're spending.</p>

<p>So here's our top tips on how to stick to your budget, finding the best deals on Prime Day 2020, and how to prepare ahead of the two-day Amazon event.</p>

<p>The next Amazon Prime Day starts at 00:01am on Tuesday October 13, 2020, and will end at 11:59pm BST on Wednesday October 14, 2020. </p>

<p>The Prime Day event will run for 48 hours, allowing Prime customers even more time to benefit from exciting offers.</p>

<p>In 2015, Amazon marked its 20th birthday with a celebratory day of sales called Prime Day. The e-commerce giant offered its Prime customers more deals on Prime Day than Black Friday and the event exceeded expectations. Since 2015, Amazon Prime Day has returned each year and it's always been bigger and more successful than the last.</p>

<p>Amazon is promising even more Prime Day 2020 deals than in previous years including Lightning Deals and Flash Deals.</p>

<p>How to get access to Amazon Prime Day deals</p>

<p>Amazon Prime Day is only accessible to Amazon Prime members, so make sure you've signed up ahead of the event to save time on the day and avoid missing out on exclusive deals.</p>

<p>Amazon CEO Worldwide Consumer said: 'Our vision is that Prime Day should be the absolute best time to be a member - when you can enjoy shopping, savings, entertainment and some of the best deals Prime members have ever seen.'  </p>

<p>If you've never been a Prime member before, you can take advantage of the free Amazon Prime 30 day trial that gives you access to Prime Day 2020. </p>

<p>If you want to remain a Prime member after your free trial then it will cost just £7.99 a month, or £79 per year.</p>

<p>If you're a student, you might be eligible for the the Prime Student membership, which offers a six-month free trial. Once the trial period ends, it will automatically convert to either a £39 per year or £3.99 Amazon Prime membership.</p>

<p>The benefits of becoming an Amazon Prime member mean you get free super-fast shipping on most purchases plus access to Prime Video as well as Prime Music and Prime Photos.  </p>

<p>How to budget for Amazon Prime Day 2020</p>

<p>Ahead of Prime Day, write a list of what you'd like to buy, including features like the brand name or model, and note the price before the event so that you can assess how much you're saving. </p>

<p>Or if you prefer to keep it digital, create an Amazon Wish List or shopping list so that your desired products are ready to add straight into your basket. Amazon will note whether there's a reduction/new offer when you re-visit your shopping list.</p>

<p>Remember to set your budget and also note how much you're willing to spend on products you didn't know you needed, but the products you deserved.</p>

<p>Knowing what you want and the price you're willing to pay before Prime Day means you can decide whether it's a good saving.</p>

<p>What are the best Amazon Prime Day deals? </p>

<p>Amazon will remain tight-lipped about their deals and offers for Prime Day 2020 until the launch of the event, however we can make a slight guess of what some products might be discounted based on some of 2019's best deals like £100 off the Echo Show and 50 per cent of the Echo Dot. </p>

<p>Amazon Prime Day's featured Lightning Deals are expected to be some of the best offers during the event and are only available for a limited time and while stocks last.</p>

<p>These products are expected to sell out fast so the best time to check for Lightning Deals is first thing in the morning. You'll then have time to research the product and set yourself reminders for when those best Lightning Deals start.</p>

<p>The easiest way to preview, track and shop Lightning Deals is by receiving deal alerts on your smartphone via the Amazon App. Simply go to the Amazon App menu, tap Notifications and turn on Watched and Waitlisted Deals. You can then add upcoming deals to your Watchlist which will push notifications on your phone when the deal is about to go live. </p>

<p>Another quick way to find Amazon Prime Day deals you'll love is to browse categories you know you're interested in and regularly buy from.</p>

<p>Prime members can also search Prime Day offers through the search box on the top of Amazon's site. Simply search for the product you're hoping to get a deal on and check regularly to see if any offers are available.</p>

<p>Already have an Echo Dot or Amazon smart home device? Alexa makes it very easy to find the best Prime Day deals. Simply ask: 'Alexa, what are my Prime Day deals?'</p>

<p>To save time when making your voice purchase requests, ensure your payment and shipping information is up to date ahead of Prime Day. You can manage your settings in the Alexa app or for see here for more information. </p>
