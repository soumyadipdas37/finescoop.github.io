<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Harry Redknapp has urged former club Tottenham to now make a move for Luka Modric as they prepare to finalise Gareth Bale's sensational return to the club.</p>

<p>Bale is expected to complete a return to north London imminently on a season-long loan deal worth over £13million.</p>

<p>But Redknapp believes his former club should go one step further and bring another ex-player back to the club, insisting Luka Modric could add another dimension to Jose Mourinho's midfield.</p>

<p>Harry Redknapp has urged former club Tottenham to now sign Luka Modric this summer</p>

<p>Redknapp believes the Croatian would add another dimension to Jose Mourinho's midfield</p>

<p>The move would see Modric reunited with Gareth Bale (L) who is close to completing a loan to Spurs</p>

<p>Speaking on Stats Perform News, Redknapp said: 'I'd go and see if I could get Luka Modric back. Take the pair of them, Bale and Modric.</p>

<p>'That would be a great coup. Luka is still a fantastic player. That would be amazing.</p>

<p>'I still feel they need somebody there; they've got the forward players, but they need somebody to supply the bullets.</p>

<p>'That's where someone like Luka Modric can play killer passes, into great movement up front. They lack a player like that.'</p>

<p>Modric played for Spurs between 2008 and 2012, establishing himself as one of the best midfielders in the world before leaving for the Bernabeu.</p>

<p>Real signed him for around £30m and he has gone on to win the Champions League on four occasions, as well as LaLiga twice.</p>

<p>He is out of contract next summer and it remains to be seen how willing the Spanish giants will be to offer him new terms, given Modric has just turned 35.</p>

<p>But he made 40 appearances for Zinedine Zidane last season, hinting he is still very much a part of his plans and it would take a huge fee to lure him back to Spurs. </p>

<p>Modric played for Spurs between 2008 and 2012 before leaving for Real Madrid for £30m</p>

<p>Bale was filmed arriving at Real Madrid's training ground early on Thursday morning as he said his goodbyes to team-mates before completing his move to Spurs</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Bale had sealed a season-long loan return to Tottenham.</p>

<p>He will have medical tests in Madrid on Friday before flying to London in the next 24 hours to ratify the move. A few minor formalities were completed on Thursday and all that is left is for Bale to arrive and sign.</p>

<p>Boss Jose Mourinho refused to be drawn on the Bale deal after Thursday night's Europa League victory against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Bulgaria.</p>

<p>'I can't comment,' he said. 'I don't comment on something that I don't know. For me, at this moment, until Gareth Bale is a Tottenham player I still think and respect the fact that he is a Real Madrid player. I am not going to comment on a Real Madrid player.'</p>

<p>Tottenham have also sealed their £27million swoop for left back Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid. He completed his medical on Thursday, which could open the door for Ryan Sessegnon to leave on loan. </p>
