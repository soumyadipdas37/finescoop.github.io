<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Teenager Aaron Hill claimed a sensational second round victory over Ronnie O'Sullivan as he won 5-4 against the world champion at the European Masters.</p>

<p>The 18-year-old had let slip a 3-1 lead against the Rocket, who was in action for the first time since he triumphed at the Crucible last month.</p>

<p>While O'Sullivan levelled proceedings and moved ahead, Hill hit back to force a decider and a break of 78 sent him through to the third round where he will face Matthew Stevens.</p>

<p>Ronnie O'Sullivan (pictured at last month's World Championships) has been dumped out of the second round of the European Masters by teenage rookie Aaron Hill</p>

<p>Irishman Hill only turned professional earlier this year, but he showed nerves of steel to suggest the future could be bright for the Cork potter.</p>

<p>The shock defeat comes just a month after the Rocket hit out at the next generation of snooker stars by calling them 'half-decent amateurs' during the World Championships.Â </p>

<p>Hours before at the behind-closed doors event in Milton Keynes, Peter Devlin caused another upset against Mark Williams.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old had to hold his nerve to beat the three-time world champion in a decider at the Marshall Arena.</p>

<p>Devlin had been 4-1 up, but Williams responded only for the rookie to clinch a 5-4 victory with a break of 102.</p>

<p>'What a time to make a century, in a deciding frame against someone like that,' the Londoner told World Snooker Tour.</p>

<p>The shock defeat to the 18-year-old comes a month after the Rocket (pictured in August) hit out at the next generation of snooker stars by calling them 'half-decent amateurs'</p>

<p>'It's unbelievable. At 4-1, I knew I could have been pegged back. Players like that can win frames without you doing much wrong, so I was expecting a comeback.</p>

<p>'At 4-4, there was still a bit of adrenaline going but I managed to calm it down again.'</p>

<p>Williams and O'Sullivan were not the only former world champions to exit in the second round with Ken Doherty knocked out by Mark Allen.</p>

<p>Northern Irishman Allen equalled history in the 5-0 win by hitting four consecutive centuries but fell short of the record with no hundred registered in the fifth frame.</p>

<p>Kyren Wilson, a runner-up at the World Championship, also progressed following a whitewash, while Ding Junhui had to dig in to beat Hossein Vafael 5-3.</p>

<p>Neil Robertson, who won the European Masters event in Austria at the start of 2020, made it through safely to the third round after a 5-2 win over Riley Parsons, but it was teenager Hill who was the talk of the town.</p>
