<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Angela Rayner had got her bovver boots on. Great clod-hopping things they were, the sort that Teddy Boys used to wear while out on the razzle. </p>

<p>Not for her the genteel kitten clackers Theresa May used to fashion. One swing of the Rayner hoof in these babies could do a man some serious damage. </p>

<p>Labour’s deputy leader had just come stomping into the chamber for her debut appearance at PMQs. Johnson v Rayner.</p>

<p>As showdowns go, this was a lip-smacker. I’m amazed Don King didn’t try to put it on pay-per-view. </p>

<p>Labour’s deputy leader Angela Rayner had a dig at Dominic Cummings, suggesting that ‘the next time a man with symptoms drives from London to Durham, it’ll probably be for the nearest Covid test’</p>

<p>Miss Rayner is a coarse but likeable bruiser who left school at 16 while pregnant, sans qualifications. </p>

<p>Boris? Well, let’s just say Ange wouldn’t mind connecting one of those boots with a soft and sensitive part of his anatomy. </p>

<p>Parking herself in front of the despatch box, Rayner shot her colleague Valerie Vaz a sisterly smile.   </p>

<p>If there were a flight of butterflies flapping around her tummy, she wasn’t showing it. </p>

<p>As the Prime Minister tumbled into his seat, Labour’s chief whip Nick Brown rolled over like a Russian doll to growl something in Rayner’s ear. ‘Good luck’ possibly. Or more probably: ‘Don’t cock it up, luv.’ </p>

<p>Rayner began well. Very well. ‘I’ve got a message from a man called Keir,’ she announced, a dig at Jeremy Corbyn’s habit of reading out messages from the public. </p>

<p>The government benches laughed appreciatively. Keir had apparently been self-isolating for the past two days while one of his children awaited a result from one of the Government’s creaky test centres. </p>

<p>Somehow this segued into a question about care homes. </p>

<p>How much, Rayner asked, did the average care worker earn? Boris made that stuttery noise Hugh Grant used to make in Richard Curtis movies. </p>

<p>Labour leader Keir Starmer (pictured right) skipped PMQs on Wednesday but is out of quarantine after he had been self-isolating for the past two days while one of his children awaited a result from one of the Government’s test centres.</p>

<p>‘Uh-uh-ugh, Mr Speaker. Uh-uh-uh.’ Chris Bryant (Lab, Rhondda) began imitating him. </p>

<p>Several other MPs joined in. SNP leader Ian Blackford permitted himself a vulpine smile. So did the Lib Dem’s Sir Ed Davey. </p>

<p>Short odds are that neither pompous puffball had any clue either, but they were revelling in the PM’s discomfiture. </p>

<p>Eventually, Boris pointed out that workers were paid substantially more since the Government implemented the living wage. </p>

<p>THAT was Rayner’s best moment. From then on, she went all wooden. That early zap deserted her. </p>

<p>Turning her attention back to testing, she essayed a gag about Dominic Cummings, suggesting that ‘the next time a man with symptoms drives from London to Durham, it’ll probably be for the nearest Covid test’. </p>

<p>It may have read well during rehearsal but her delivery was clunkier than an old Lada Riva. </p>

<p>Boris was much better than in the past couple of weeks, shaky start aside. He was serious and workmanlike. </p>

<p>Johnson v Rayner: Boris Johnson's blood pressure hopped briefly following a silly suggestion from Rayner that the Government had allowed grouse shooting to continue simply because one of Boris’ donors</p>

<p>Nor did he try to rough up or get smart with the stand-in oppo. Instead, he treated her with rare deference. ‘</p>

<p>Of course the Hon. Lady is right to express the frustration of people across this country about the massive demand there is now for tests…’ </p>

<p>His blood pressure hopped briefly following a silly suggestion from Rayner that the Government had allowed grouse shooting to continue simply because one of Boris’ donors, ex-Carphone Warehouse tycoon David Ross, owns a grouse moor. </p>

<p>Appalled groans erupted from the government benches. Boris accused his opponents of ‘carping from the sidelines’ over ‘issues that are tangential’. Attacking country pursuits is of course a Labour obsession. </p>

<p>There is never any consideration for the thousands of low-paid workers who rely on it as a livelihood. </p>

<p>When Sir Lindsay Hoyle called time, Rayner hovered for a while. She grinned at colleagues, flashing them a thumbs-up. </p>

<p>It was obviously quite a moment for her and quite right too. Such a pity families remain barred from the public galleries.</p>
