<p>Bell - who has been married to Shepard since 2013 - didn't say whether daughter Delta, five, or Lincoln, seven, was responsible for the sweet note.</p>

<p>She joined in the praise in her caption, writing: 'Today is my husband's 16th sobriety birthday. My daughter woke him up with this sign, and a sketch of the one and only Ronald Weasley(absolutely random, and also perfect).'</p>

<p>'Happy birthday Daxy. Thank you for dedicating your life to the hard and wonderful work of sobriety, so that we could share it with you.</p>

<p>Dax and Bell have been open about how sobriety is a constant commitment.</p>

<p>'I know how much effort has to be put into staying sober,' Kristen told People in 2018.</p>

<p>'I don't mean that to be like, I come home and see him shaking and looking at a whiskey ad or something, [but] there are different elements you have to deal with when you're staying sober. It's a ton of mental control and evolution.'</p>
