<p>The Morning Consult/Politico poll also found registered voters rated Tiffany Trump as the least hated among the president's adult children. </p>

<p>Tiffany rated higher than her half-siblings, Ivanka, Donald Jr. and Eric - with Don Jr. and Eric Trump coming in at a tie for last. Barron Trump, who is only 14 years old, was not included in the poll's questions. </p>

<p>Melania Trump won higher marks among Republicans for her convention speech last week than Ivanka Trump did, according to a new poll</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump's speech to the Republican National Convention was more political in nature than first lady Melania Trump's</p>

<p>The poll also found Tiffany Trump is the least hated of the adult Trump children</p>

<p>And voters overall gave Melania their nod of approval over the first daughter when it came to address last week's Republican faithful. </p>

<p>The poll found 62 per cent of Republicans and 33 per cent of overall respondents gave the first lady high marks for her speech. And 54 per cent of Republicans and 26 per cent overall said the same of Ivanka Trump. </p>

<p>Each Trump - the two most prominent women in the first family - used a different tone in their convention speeches: Melania showed compassion for those suffering from COVID and talked race relations while Ivanka Trump gave a more political address, defending her father's record and arguing for his re-election. </p>

<p>In her convention speech last week, given from the newly-renovated White House Rose Garden, Melania Trump painted her husband's weaknesses as strengths in her speech designed to appeal to female voters.</p>

<p>'I urge people to come together in a civil manner so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice,' she said.</p>

<p>She said of racial division: 'Like many of you, I have reflected on the racial unrest in our country. We are not proud of parts of our history.' </p>

<p>And she paid explicit tribute to the dead of the coronavirus pandemic - never using President Trump's 'China virus' phrase'  - saying she mourned with those left behind.</p>

<p>Her speech was meant to smooth away her husband's rough edges even as she was careful to stay out of the political arena.</p>

<p>The Morning Consult/Politico poll rated the favorability of the adult members of the Trump family</p>

<p>In contrast, Ivanka Trump introduced her father as 'the People's President' during her Thursday night speech.</p>

<p>She delivered her remarks from the White House's South Lawn before the president took the stage.</p>

<p>'I recognize that my dad's communication style is not to everyone's taste. And I know his tweets can feel a bit unfiltered,' she said with a pause. 'But the results speak for themselves.' </p>

<p>And she gave a campaign rallying cry.</p>

<p>'Donald Trump did not come to Washington to win praise from the beltway elites. Donald Trump came to Washington for one reason, and one reason alone: To Make America Great Again,' she declared.</p>

<p>And the two women set fire to social media on that final night of the convention when the first lady gave a frosty look to the first daughter as they stood on stage together on the South  Lawn.</p>

<p>After Ivanka shared an introductory remarks for her father’s acceptance speech she shared a brief glance with Melania walking across the stage. </p>

<p>Melania was captured on video giving Ivanka a smile and a nod before bulging her eyes and making a cold, sour expression.</p>

<p>The look came after an excerpt from the memoir of Melania's former best friend Stephanie Winston Wolkoff was released, revealing that the First Lady plotted 'Operation Block Ivanka' to prevent Ivanka from appearing in Trump’s inauguration photos.</p>

<p>First Lady Melania Trump exchanged a frosty greeting with Ivanka Trump on the stage of the Republican National Convention on Thursday, hours after details of their fraught relationship were released in an excerpt of an upcoming book</p>

<p>Icy relationship: Melania's face turned cold after the First Daughter passed by</p>

<p>Twitter users had a field day with the icy exchange. This Twitter user captioned the moment saying: 'Melania Trump gives Ivanka Trump that look that "I like you only because I have to"'</p>

<p>Social media users were quick to pick up on the tension and posted close-up videos of Melania’s reaction on Thursday.</p>

<p>'Melania Trump gives Ivanka Trump that look that "I like you only because I have to,"' one Twitter user noted. </p>

<p>'Call it a hunch, but I don't think Melania likes Ivanka very much. On that, we can agree,' another Twitter user commented.</p>

<p>In 'Operation Block Ivanka' Melania approved seating arrangements for the inauguration platform that would keep Ivanka out of the camera shot when her father was sworn in as president.</p>

<p>The book details a tense and, at times, competitive relationship between the two women.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tiffany Trump, in her convention speech last Tuesday, railed against the media, the tech giants and the education system suggesting they keep the American people 'mentally enslaved.' </p>

<p>It was one of her first campaign appearance this year for her father and was a marked change from her speech four years ago, when she gave a personal account of her childhood with her dad. </p>

<p>'People must recognize that our thoughts, opinions, and even the choice of who we vote for are being manipulated and invisibly coerced by the media and tech giants,' the 26-year-old Georgetown Law Center graduate said. </p>

<p>She said that in the academic arena, students with opposing viewpoints are 'too afraid to speak,' while the system promotes 'groupthink.' </p>

<p>The Morning Consult/Politico poll also measured the favorability ratings of the first family.</p>

<p>Combining their positive and negative ratings for a net result, the first lady topped the family list by coming in dead even with a zero net rating. President Trump had a negative 13 net approval rating.</p>

<p>Tiffany did the best among the adult children with a negative 14, Ivanka had a negative 15, and Donald Trump Jr. and Eric both had a negative 19.</p>

<p>Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband who serves as a senior adviser in the Trump administration, had a negative 21. </p>
