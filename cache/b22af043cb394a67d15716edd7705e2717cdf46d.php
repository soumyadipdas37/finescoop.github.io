<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rail ticket sales are down 85 per cent on last year for the first half of 2020 as the 'work from home' policy' continues to inflict economic damage, Trainline said.</p>

<p>The group said that ticket sales across the UK slumped to £67million in the first quarter, with just eight per cent of prior year levels. </p>

<p>Though sales picked up in the second quarter to £174million, this was still just 22 per cent of those seen a year earlier, the group added.</p>

<p>Trainline said: 'With the industry now on a path to recovery, albeit more slowly than previously expected, Trainline is phasing its operations back to normal.'</p>

<p>Its chief executive, Clare Gilmartin, said: 'By acting quickly and remaining agile, we continue to successfully navigate through the significant disruption Covid-19 has caused to the rail and coach industry.</p>

<p>'I'm pleased to now see the industry recovering, particularly in our International markets, as well as a faster shift to online reservation and digital ticketing, as anticipated, given the increased customer need for touchless travel.'</p>

<p>The Trainline boss added: 'We will continue working hard to make rail and coach travel easier, safer and more accessible, reassuring customers and generating incremental demand for the industry.'</p>

<p>It comes amid threats from public health chiefs to have another go at smashing the UK economy as they warn of looming curfews in London, while ministers warn the 'work from home' order could be reinstated soon.</p>

<p>Senior Government sources are discussing plans to close offices within two weeks if Boris Johnson's new Rule of Six fails to bring down coronavirus cases.    </p>

<p>Employers will be left with no choice but to send staff to work from home, business leaders claimed, due to the shortage of Covid-19 tests.</p>

<p>Such a move would put a sizeable dent in the little progress that has been made to boost the economy since certain restrictions were eased.</p>

<p>A fortnight would be needed to determine whether Boris Johnson's new rule of banning gatherings of seven or more people had successfully reduced infections, senior government sources told the Telegraph.</p>

<p>They added that further lockdown measures may be required if not, with Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty understood to be recommending a second. </p>

<p>Official messaging of 'go to work if you can' appears to have been dropped, while No10 has also insisted there is no 'back to work' campaign being driven in the same way other key advice is being communicated with the public.   </p>

<p>Official messaging of 'go to work if you can', repeated by the Prime Minister, pictured yesterday, in recent weeks, appears to have been dropped </p>

<p>Many companies with headquarters in London's city centre have only a fraction of their total workforces back in the office</p>

<p>The concourse at London's Waterloo station - which is one of the capital's busiest - during the rush hour earlier this month</p>

<p>However, telling workers to stop going back to their desks would inflict further woe on pubs, cafes and restaurants which have already struggled during the pandemic and are only recently reaping the benefits of more footfall.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, more than half of workers have said they never expect to return to a five-day working week in the office, a new survey by TalkTalk has found.  </p>

<p>A new report called 'Lockdown Lessons' also found that 58 per cent of people in employment said they felt more productive as a result of working from home.</p>

<p>Bosses also agreed, with 30 per cent of business leaders saying the changes had seen a boost in productivity and 35 per cent said the moves had seen more collaboration.</p>

<p>Professor Chris Whitty is pushing for a new two-week national lockdown amid concerns the true number of coronavirus cases is far higher than being reported, a former World Health Organisation expert claims.</p>

<p>Anthony Costello, who sits on the independent SAGE panel, made the statement on Twitter on Wednesday evening, adding that daily infections could be as high as 38,000. </p>

<p>According to Mr Costello, the Prime Minister has been told by his Chief Medical Officer that such a move may be needed to stop the recent rise in infections.</p>

<p>He wrote: 'I’m hearing from a well-connected person that government now thinks, in absence of testing, there are 38,000 infections per day. Chris Whitty is advising PM for a two week national lockdown.'</p>

<p>The new working arrangements for millions of office workers also found that with the commute being removed, many are turning to learning a new skill or hobby, the survey found.</p>

<p>Around 40 per cent said they had watched an online educational video during lockdown and 16 per cent enrolled in an online learning course.</p>

<p>In other areas, nearly one-in-four work-from-home staff started learning a new language, with a similar number also learning new cooking methods. Around 15 per cent said they researched baking and 13 per cent learned about gardening.</p>

<p>TalkTalk added that internet usage during lockdown increased 40 per cent year-on-year and has remained at high levels, despite the relaxation of rules and the reopening of pubs and restaurants. Uploads have also increased significantly, the data found.</p>

<p>The company is hoping the increase in work-from-home staff will lead to demand for more reliable internet and has launched a business-quality broadband service for companies willing to install faster connections in workers' homes.</p>

<p>But less than half - 40 per cent - of business leaders said they have provided financial support to employees for phone or home broadband bills and only one in four have invested in mental health and wellbeing apps for staff.</p>

<p>The survey also found that 62 per cent of bosses believe they can save money to spend on upgrading home working due to less work trip costs and 45 per cent said company entertainment spend is also expected to fall.</p>

<p>Tristia Harrison, chief executive at TalkTalk, said: 'Lockdown Britain has seen a boost in skills and productivity for home workers, with unexpected lessons for how we emerge from the pandemic.</p>

<p>'As people have been working from home, they've also been learning: from new languages, to cooking, to IT skills. With flexible working we're becoming so much more productive it seems that Britain is now getting five days' work done in four, which is encouraging as we build back from the crisis.'</p>

<p>Catherine Barnard, from consultancy Working The Future, which analysed the data for TalkTalk, said: 'A future where a four-day work week is the norm could be a lot closer than people think.</p>

<p>'If someone can do their work in four days rather than five as a result of flexible working hours, it stands to reason that they can use the fifth day to further improve skills that complement their role. The challenge is to pivot from a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to employment.'</p>
