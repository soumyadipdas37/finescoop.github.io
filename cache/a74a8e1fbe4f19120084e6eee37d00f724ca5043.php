<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 29-year-old British man has survived after plunging 300ft down a mountainside in the snowy German Alps after going for a hike in a pair of shorts and trainers.</p>

<p>He and three other Englishmen set out for Kehlstein's 6,171ft peak on Monday, a subpeak of the colossal Göll massif in the Berchtesgaden Alps.</p>

<p>They were having difficulty navigating due to poor visibility and it being slippery underfoot when the 29-year-old fell down the rocky gully. </p>

<p>He suffered serious injuries to his legs, head and feet, but it would be more than hour until the rescue helicopter was able to find them in the dense fog.</p>

<p>The helicopter flew the man off the mountain despite heavy fog </p>

<p>Rescue teams had to triangulate the group's position using their call data before scouring the mountainside with binoculars.</p>

<p>After they were spotted, about 45 minutes after their call, mountain rescuers were able to reach them at their location, around 5,000ft up.</p>

<p>The helicopter arrived 20 minutes later, at around 5.30pm and the injured man was winched up and whisked off to hospital.</p>

<p>The others were rappelled off the steep slope by the ground crew who had hiked up to their position.</p>

<p>Despite the onset of wintry conditions, the four Britons had set out that day in shorts and trainers from their camper can in Hintereck. </p>

<p>The helicopter rushing the casualty to hospital, he had injuries across his head, legs and feet</p>
