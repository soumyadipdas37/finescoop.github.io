<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rio Ferdinand has slammed Manchester United's failure to address their defence this summer and insists signing Jadon Sancho would not mask the club's 'fundamental issues'. </p>

<p>United got off to a losing start in this season's Premier League campaign in a 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace at Old Trafford, with Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof heavily criticised for their roles in the goals.</p>

<p>The defeat added to the misery at the club, with fans having become frustrated at the lack of additions this summer and the lack of progress of signing Borussia Dortmund star Sancho. </p>

<p>Rio Ferdinand has slammed Man United centre-backs Harry Maguire (left) and Victor Lindelof</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and United's season started with defeat against Crystal Palace</p>

<p>And despite lifting some of the gloom around the club with a midweek victory against Luton in the Carabao Cup, Ferdinand insisted the United centre-backs' mistakes last weekend demonstrated why Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side require recruitment in that area.</p>

<p>'They did anything but set their stall out. They were slow and cumbersome,' Ferdinand told BT Sport of Maguire and Lindelof's display against Palace.</p>

<p>'There were so many different mistakes. It was terrible to see and it disappoints. This is an area I have spoken about for many many months, and it has not been addressed. </p>

<p>'He [Solskjaer] could show them the Europa League semi-final and FA Cup semi-final as well [for poor performances]. I think you look at Liverpool, they bought Alisson to solve their goalkeeping issue and Van Dijk for their defence, Man United have not done that [addressed their issues at the back].</p>

<p>And Ferdinand insists their problems at the back will not be masked even if Jadon Sancho signs</p>

<p>'It is not an issue that emerged the other day. I want Jadon Sancho, he is a generational talent and would get fans off their seats, but does he solve the fundamental problems I see with this team? </p>

<p>'There are moments before games when the opposition, are they looking across and saying they are going to have to be at their best to score past this Man United defence? I don't think so.'</p>

<p>When asked what position United should prioritise signing, Ferdinand responded immediately: 'Centre-half', as did fellow BT Sport pundit Joe Cole.</p>
