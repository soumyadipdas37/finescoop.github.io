<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rabih Abdulrahman (pictured), 37, has been jailed after running over and killing a 12-year-old boy in Sydney last year</p>

<p>The heartbroken mother of a 12-year-old boy who was tragically killed by a drug driver on his way to school still makes her son's bed every morning. </p>

<p>Rabih Abdulrahman, 37, had a potentially fatal amount of ice in his system when he ran over the Year 7 student who had been walking to school in Hurstville, in Sydney's south-west, in September last year.</p>

<p>The 12-year-old, who can't be named for legal reasons, had been crossing at a green walk signal before he was struck by Abdulrahman's white Toyota Corolla.</p>

<p>As onlookers tried desperately to save the young boys life, Abdulrahman lit a cigarette and began deleting messages on his phone.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old pleaded guilty to manslaughter and driving while disqualified, and on Friday was jailed for six years and ten months, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>The little boy's father described his final moments with his 'happy' child before he passed away in hospital. </p>

<p>The young boy, 12, (pictured) - who can not be named for legal reasons - was rushed to hospital but died soon after</p>

<p>Abdulrahman was unlicensed and had been serving a community sentence since last October when he ran a red light and hit the 12-year-old boy at Hurstville, in Sydney's south</p>

<p>'I could only touch his cold forehead and gently hold his hand. I knew he would never be able to call me dad again,' he said in the Downing Centre court on Friday. </p>

<p>The father said his wife was unable to cope with the 'endless missing' of her son in her life, asking for his killer to be given the harshest of penalties.</p>

<p>'(She) prepares (his) bed in perfect order and places his once favourite things on top of it, as if still with us,' he said. </p>

<p>The 12-year-old's father said it made their 'hearts chill' to think their son's killer 'did not rescue him'. </p>

<p>Abdulrahman said he'd been drug-free since the accident and begged the child's family to forgive him for his 'stupid mistake', adding he was 'deeply sorry'.</p>

<p>'I have a son that is the same age as the boy… and all I think is if it was his life that was taken,' Abdulrahman said.</p>

<p>Before the 12-year-old was killed, Abdulrahman had been speeding and had driven through a red light.</p>

<p>He was also under the influence of other drugs including MDMA, diazepam, and methadone.</p>

<p>The young student was rushed to hospital but died from his injuries hours later</p>

<p>The student suffered severe injuries to his head and shoulders which sent him into cardiac arrest.  </p>

<p>According to court documents, the level of methylamphetamine in Abdulrahman's blood was 'well within the reported toxic to potentially fatal range'.</p>

<p>When police arrived at the scene of the crash, Abdulrahman was 'uncooperative and agitated', while offering no help to those giving first aid. Officers later found a syringe in his car. </p>

<p>He told police he had taken it three days earlier. He also said he takes morphine every day for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.</p>

<p>'I've got f***ing PTSD. I need my medication,' he said.</p>

<p>Abdulrahman initially lied to police, telling them: 'I got hit by a car, it's not my fault.' </p>

<p>While being interviewed at a police station he said: 'go look for the car that hit me! I didn't mean to kill anyone, give me f***ing bail'. </p>

<p>Abdulrahman previously served jail time for being an accessory to manslaughter after a drug deal went wrong.</p>

<p>Documents showed that in May 2005, Abdulrahman had been at a unit at Bexley, near Hurstville, when a man was shot dead during a dispute over a drug deal.  </p>

<p>Police arrested and charged the shooter, before later intercepting phone calls where Abdulrahman told his mother he knew the identity of the gunman.</p>

<p>Abdulrahman initially lied to police, telling them: 'I got hit by a car, it's not my fault.'</p>

<p>Abdulrahman (pictured following his arrest) had a toxic amount of ice in his system at the time of the crash</p>

<p>Agreed facts state that in the days after the shooting, Abdulrahman also helped 'to hinder (in the shooter's) apprehension, trial and punishment'.</p>

<p>Abdulrahman initially denied being at the unit, but eventually entered a guilty plea.</p>

<p>He was sentenced to a minimum two years imprisonment which was allowed to be served as weekend detention.  </p>

<p>Since being released from jail, Abdulrahman was then convicted of assaulting a policeman, driving under the influence of drugs , carrying a weapon in a public place and resisting arrest. </p>

<p>He was serving a corrections order in the community but was banned from driving. </p>

<p>The court heard he had also had substance abuse issues for the last 13 years. </p>

<p>Abdulrahman will be eligible for parole on April 5, 2024.    </p>

<p>The 37-year-old was jailed for six years on Friday and will be eligible for parole in April, 2024</p>
