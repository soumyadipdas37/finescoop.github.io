<p>A dog is understood to be at the centre of the mysterious death, the ABC reported (stock image)</p>

<p>'[He was] just sort of saying  a dog had attacked somebody in his house and that it was pretty gruesome,' Mr Scott said.</p>

<p>'And as that was happening, police and ambos turned up … he was pretty panicky.</p>

<p>'Hopefully it was just a bad accident and nothing worse than that.'</p>

<p>An council animal ranger was also called to the scene, in addition to homicide detectives.  </p>

<p>Titan Wiwanno, who lives nearby, confirmed a big dog lives at the home, and it often barked and tried to climb the fence.</p>

<p>He told the West Australian he didn't know the man but often saw him come in and out of his home.  </p>

<p>Police, along with forensics team, are expected to be at the property for most of the day</p>

<p>'I came back from the gym (last night) and all I saw were all police cars and ambulances,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's sad... he seems like a pretty nice guy.</p>

<p>'I always see him and wave.' </p>

<p>Police, along with forensics team, are expected to be at the property for most of the day.  </p>
