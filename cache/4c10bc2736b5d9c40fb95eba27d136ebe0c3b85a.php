<p>It's all good: After six years on the outs, Katy surprised fans by appearing in the music video for Taylor's track You Need To Calm Down in 2018</p>

<p>Dressed as a cheeseburger in the whimsical video, Katy reunited with Taylor who was dressed as french fries and together the hitmakers showed fans how far they had come. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the singer recently joked about the speculation that Katy and Taylor are actually cousins. </p>

<p>When asked about the bizarre rumor, she said: 'Well, we fight like cousins.'  </p>

<p>Taylor previously revealed she and Katy blamed their zodiac signs for their feud, which began in 2014 when Taylor accused Katy of stealing three of her backing dancers for her tour. </p>

<p>The Lover singer explained: 'Katy and I were talking about our signs ... of course we were ... we were talking about our signs because we had this really, really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff.'</p>

<p>Taylor, born in December, is a Sagittarius and Katy, born in October, is a Scorpio according to the Zodiac. </p>

<p>Swift continued: 'And I remember in the long talk, she was like, "If we had one glass of white wine right now, we'd both be crying." Because we were drinking tea.'</p>

<p>'We've had some really good conversations. We were talking about how we've had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other,' the Grammy winner said of Perry.</p>

<p>'She's like, "I'm a Scorpio. Scorpios just strike when they feel threatened." And I was like, "Well, I'm an archer. We literally stand back, assess the situation, process how we feel about it, raise a bow, pull it back, and fire."</p>

<p>'So it's a completely different way of processing pain, confusion, misconception,' Taylor concluded. </p>

<p>Extending the olive branch: In 2018, Katy sent her 'old friend' Taylor an actual olive branch </p>

<p>Last year, Taylor told Heart Breakfast it was Katy that instigated their reunion.</p>

<p>The Bad Blood hitmaker revealed: 'We reconnected a while ago. It started when she sent an olive branch to, like an actual olive branch to my tour – on the first day of my Reputation Stadium tour and I was like, that is not only really cool and really sincere, the note but like, very clever with sending an actual olive branch.'</p>

<p>Taylor continued by explaining that the gesture removed any tension and bad feeling from their argument and they decided to put their feud behind them.</p>

<p>She explained: 'It was like a beautiful wreath and you could hang it, it was really so great. And so that was when you know I think for both of us it was completely like there was no weird feelings.'</p>

<p>'We've had some really good conversations. We were talking about how we've had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other,' the Grammy winner said of Perry (Pictured in 2019)</p>
