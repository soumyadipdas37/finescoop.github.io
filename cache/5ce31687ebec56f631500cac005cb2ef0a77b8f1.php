<p>She added: 'anyhow man it's just so bad but I see the light finally.'</p>

<p>By speaking so candidly about her treatment, Teigen had fans and followers begging her to 'share more info' about the procedure. </p>

<p>One Twitter user that reached out to Chrissy expressed that, although they were 'not pregnant,' they have been 'looking for another option' for their persistent migraines.</p>

<p>'Jaw Botox for my grinding was a MUST for my regular headaches. You can also do behind the brow for migraines. Life changing,' replied the Sports Illustrated star.</p>

<p>Though Chrissy was able to get her botox treatment approved while pregnant, one follower was not so lucky.</p>

<p>'They wouldn't do my botox when I was pregnant. I get it for migraines. Hope you get some relief,' they wrote.</p>

<p>Chrissy, clearly sympathetic to the Twitter user's struggle, noted that 'if you have the means to go to a neurologist instead of cosmetic it's a lot better and safer because they talk to your OB.' </p>
