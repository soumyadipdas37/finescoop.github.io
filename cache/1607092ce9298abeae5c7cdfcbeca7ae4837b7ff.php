<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A missing mother has been found floating alive off the coast of Colombia two years after she lost contact with her family and vanished.  </p>

<p>The woman lost contact with her family two years ago and they had no idea where she was until now when she was found floating around a mile off a beach from the town and municipality of Puerto Colombia located in the Colombian department of Atlantico on 26 September.</p>

<p>She was later identified as Angelica Gaitan, 46, who was found in a very weakened state with signs of hypothermia by fisherman Rolando Visbal. </p>

<p>What she had been doing in the previous two years and how she ended up in the sea is currently being investigated by police.</p>

<p>The video shows the moment Visbal and a friend simply identified as ‘Gustavo’ approach the floating woman who is almost completely unresponsive.</p>

<p>Visbal is heard yelling at the 46-year-old in Spanish and then switching to English apparently trying to make sure the victim understood him.</p>

<p>Gaitan continues to be dragged towards the boat through the rope tied to the lifesaver which the fishers had previously thrown towards her.</p>

<p>Visbal is then seen struggling to lift the woman into the boat who has remained unresponsive but moves her torso just enough to help get her body over the edge and safely onto the boat.</p>

<p>The fisher then tries to have a conversation with her and give her water but the victim, who is visually upset, begins to cry and remains in an altered state as the video comes to an end.</p>

<p>According to reports the woman was floating in the water for about eight hours and was taken to a hospital where she arrived in a state of shock.</p>

<p>The circumstances surrounding the bizarre incident remain unclear especially after the local media tracked down the woman's daughter Alejandra Castiblanco who said she had not known about her mum’s whereabouts for the past two years.</p>

<p>She said suggestions that her mother had been suicidal over a broken relationship or because of an attack by a former lover were fake news.</p>

<p>Castiblanco and her sister are currently raising money to transport their mum to the capital city of Bogota where they live and hope their mum will be “taken care of by family”.</p>
