<p>She added: 'I used to eat this way, so let's see how it goes.' </p>

<p>A vegetarian diet is completely free of meat consumption and, often times, the consumption of by-products resulting from animal slaughter.</p>

<p>One of the meat-free entrees Bethenny prepared on Sunday was a delicious looking cauliflower crust pizza with 'vegan mozzarella [she] shredded and marinara.'</p>

<p>The successful entrepreneur noted that 'the key' to making the cauliflower crust as delectable as possible is by '[using] a pizza stone and crisp[ing] both sides of crust on high heat before adding toppings.'</p>

<p>Vegetarian meals: 'Bryn wants to be a vegetarian cause she loves animals, so she's asked me to do it with her,' explained Frankel, who shared images of some of the ethical dishes she whipped up</p>

<p>She followed up her pizza post with images of some pan-roasted 'vegan fish filets,' a serving of herby potatoes, and a refreshing romaine lettuce, tomato, and baby corn salad.</p>

<p>Frankel added a line to her post that urged her 2.2million followers to 'Use what [they] have' at their disposal to make plant-based dishes of their own. </p>

<p>Removing meat, including seafood, may prove beneficial for Bethenny, being that she suffers from a 'rare fish allergy.'</p>

<p>Back in 2018, the reality star's allergy became public knowledge, when she experienced a near fatal reaction after consuming a bowl of fish soup at a restaurant.</p>

<p>'I had soup, itched &amp; was unconscious for 15 mins then to ER &amp; ICU for 2 days with BP (blood pressure) of 60/40,' revealed Bethenny on Twitter at the time. </p>

<p>She added: '911 &amp; EPI save me. I’ll never not carry an #epipen <?php echo e('@'); ?>NewtonWellseley.'</p>

<p>Bethenny shares 10-year-old daughter Bryn with ex husband and businessman Jason Hoppy, 49. The pair originally wed in 2010.</p>

<p>Frankel has been quarantining with Bryn and her film producer boyfriend Paul Bernon at all three of her properties in Manhattan, the Hamptons, and their newly acquired home in Boston.</p>

<p>She stressed the importance of posting more unfiltered and 'realistic' images of women on social media. </p>

<p>'The more I see photos on social media that are filtered, contoured, eyelashed, extensioned, &amp; retouched - the more important it is to post #nofilter, real, everyday photos. I want to show our daughters (and sons) a realistic female image. #THISiswhatilooklike #thisisme #unfilteredselfie #noglam #workingmom,' wrote Frankel. </p>
