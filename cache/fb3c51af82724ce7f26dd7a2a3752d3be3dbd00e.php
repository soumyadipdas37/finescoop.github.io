<p>Sotheby's said on Thursday that the 102.39-carat diamond, a flawless white sparkler, was the second-largest oval diamond of its kind to be offered at auction. </p>

<p>The largest, a 118.28-carat diamond, set a record $30.8 million price when it was sold under the hammer in 2013.</p>

<p>'Diamonds of this caliber and size have sold anywhere between $11.9 million to $33.7 million,' said Quig Bruning, head of Sotheby's New York jewelry department. </p>

<p>About the size of an egg or a large lollipop, the diamond is going up for auction next month and is expected to fetch $12 million to $30 million</p>

<p>Only seven such diamonds, known in the trade as D color flawless or internally flawless white diamonds, over 100 carats have previously been sold at auction.</p>

<p>'More and more people have come to understand that something billions of years old and of the size of a lollipop can store as much value as a Rembrandt self-portrait or a Basquiat,' Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of jewelry at Sotheby's, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The diamond will be sold in a single-lot action without a reserve price at Sotheby's in Hong Kong on October 5.</p>
