<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dozens of easyJet passengers have been forced to quarantine for 14 days after they were put into a hotel in Spain when their flight from Gibraltar was delayed. </p>

<p>The passengers would have been able to avoid quarantine had the flight gone ahead as planned because the British Overseas Territory is on the UK's 'safe list'. </p>

<p>But due to poor weather their flight on Monday was rescheduled and they needed overnight accommodation. </p>

<p>But all hotel rooms in Gibraltar were full so they had to find their own hotel room, fend for themselves or accept the airline's offer of hotel rooms in Spain.  </p>

<p>Dozens of easyJet passengers have been forced to quarantine for 14 days after they were put into a hotel in Spain when their flight from Gibraltar (pictured) was delayed</p>

<p>Passengers who had no other option but to accept the airline's offer were then forced to make their own way across the border into Spain - a coronavirus hotspot.   </p>

<p>That meant they would be forced to quarantine for two weeks when they finally got back to the UK yesterday. </p>

<p>One passenger, Charlie Markham, 22, told The Sun: 'EasyJet bussed everyone over to Spain for the night and now they're going to be mixing with people on the flight back who were safe in Gibraltar.'</p>

<p>At the end of last week there were only 31 active coronavirus cases in Gibraltar whereas Spain recorded 8,000 new infections on Friday alone. </p>

<p>It was removed from the UK's safe travel corridor last month.   </p>

<p>All hotel rooms in Gibraltar were full so passengers had to accept the airline's offer to find their own hotel room or fend for themselves (stock picture)</p>

<p>Basil Pru, of Surrey, was among those taken to Cadiz and told the news site: 'We hear a few are going to keep it hush-hush because they don't want to isolate.'</p>

<p>An easyJet spokesman said: 'As a result of low visibility weather conditions in Gibraltar easyJet had to delay flight EZY8906 to Gatwick overnight.  </p>

<p>'We tried to provide as many hotel rooms in Gibraltar as possible however, due to a shortage of rooms it was not possible to provide these for all customers so we offered accommodation in Spain for those who wanted it. </p>

<p>'Some customers found accommodation themselves in Gibraltar and easyJet will reimburse the cost to them.</p>

<p>'Whilst the delay was outside of our control, we would like to apologise to customers for the inconvenience caused as a result of the weather.'</p>
