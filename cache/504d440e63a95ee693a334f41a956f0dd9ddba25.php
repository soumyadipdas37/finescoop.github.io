<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An estate agent who was caught driving at twice the drink-drive limit after she turned to alcohol while on furlough has been banned from driving for nearly two years. </p>

<p>Amy Humphreys, 27, from Bury, pleaded guilty to one count of drink driving after admitting to police she drank two glasses of red wine before getting behind the wheel. </p>

<p>She was driving her white Range Rover Evoque in Bury around 10.50pm on June 19 when patrolling officers allegedly saw her skip a red light, Manchester Magistrates' Court heard.</p>

<p>Humphreys turned right and pulled over where she admitted to drinking two glasses of red wine, Manchester Evening News reported. </p>

<p>Amy Humphreys (pictured), 27, from Bury, was driving her white Range Rover Evoque around 10.50pm on June 19</p>

<p>She was taken to a police station after giving a positive reading for alcohol in a roadside breath test.  </p>

<p>She gave a reading of 98mg of alcohol in 100ml of breath, while the legal limit is 35mg. </p>

<p>Mitigating, Paul Shepherd said that it was out of character for Humphreys. He said: 'On the day in question, it was during lockdown and she noticed she had been drinking at home, which was something she had not usually done. </p>

<p>'She had struggled with the environment and being furloughed and being off work.' </p>

<p>He added that, after receiving a call from her father who had fallen, Humphreys had panicked and driven to see him. </p>

<p>Mr Shepherd said that Humphreys was going through a difficult time, with her mother undergoing cancer treatment. </p>

<p>Mitigating, Paul Shepherd said it was out of character for Humphreys (pictured) and that she 'had struggled with the environment and being furloughed' </p>

<p>He said Humphreys has since sought help from her GP and was 'very ashamed and embarrassed' by her behaviour.  </p>

<p>Zak Azim, prosecuting, said officers were driving along Bolton Road in Bury when they spotted her driving 50 metres in front of them. </p>

<p>He said that, when officers went to speak to her, they believed she was under the influence and could smell intoxicants on her breath.   </p>

<p>Humphreys was said to have no previous convictions. She was not charged with going through the red light. </p>

<p>She was fined £615, ordered to pay £85 court costs and a £61 victim surcharge and was disqualified from driving for 23 months. </p>

<p>She must take an extended retest before getting behind the wheel again.  </p>

<p>It was said that not being able to drive will make part of her job more difficult when she goes to value houses and help clients.  </p>

<p>Sentencing her, magistrates said: 'This is a very serious offence and you know that. </p>

<p>'We don't think a community order will be workable due to your personal circumstances and employment status.'   </p>
