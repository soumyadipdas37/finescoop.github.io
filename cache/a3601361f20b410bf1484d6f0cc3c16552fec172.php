<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>THE fashion giant behind Louis Vuitton has pulled out of a blockbuster £12.4bn takeover of Tiffany – sparking a bitter legal battle.</p>

<p>The French government told LVMH to delay the deal, the largest ever takeover in the sector, as part of a trade war sparked by Donald Trump’s threats to put tariffs on France’s luxury sector in response to plans to impose a digital services tax on US tech companies. </p>

<p>Spotlight: Tiffany's products are often modelled by Hollywood stars like Gwyneth Paltrow (pictured) </p>

<p>LVMH said that given the request from the foreign ministry, and its own legal analysis, it could not do the deal.</p>

<p>Tiffany, whose products are often modelled by Hollywood stars like Gwyneth Paltro, filed papers with the Delaware Court demanding the merger is completed by November 24.</p>

<p>It said the £184billion French conglomerate deliberately stalled winning approval from EU competition authorities.</p>

<p>Tiffany’s shares fell in the US yesterday wiping £1billion, off its value early on.</p>
