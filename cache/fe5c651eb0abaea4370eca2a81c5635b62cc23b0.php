<p>The mother-of-three has looked back over those days in I Hate Suzie.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, she told the Radio Times of tapping into her character: 'I know exactly what that feels like and I’m sure it feeds into my performance. I’m only coming to terms with a lot of it right now.  </p>

<p>'In my 20s a lot of my stress from that period was buried, and I still struggle to remember a lot of it. I don’t regret it. I love what I do and where I’m at personally.</p>

<p>'But I certainly wouldn’t want my children to go that way. There’s an anxiety of me as a child that I probably on some levels smother my children with.' </p>

<p>Billie shares sons Winston, 11, and Eugene, eight, with ex-husband Laurence Fox, and has 19-month-old daughter Tallulah with Johnny Lloyd. </p>
