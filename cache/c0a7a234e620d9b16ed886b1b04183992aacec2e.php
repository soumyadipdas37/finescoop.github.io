<p>Although the demonstrations have largely been peaceful in recent weeks, protesters scuffled with police in several locations.</p>

<p>Police also said two officers were lightly injured when a crowd burst through a police blockade.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu has dismissed the protesters as 'leftists' and 'anarchists'. But his tough talk, and even a series of foreign policy accomplishments, have done nothing to deter the crowds.</p>

<p>Mr Netanyahu has vowed to remain in office despite being charged last year with bribery, fraud and breach of trust in three long-running corruption investigations.</p>

<p>He has denied the allegations, calling them a 'witch hunt' and lashing out at the judiciary, law enforcement and media.</p>
