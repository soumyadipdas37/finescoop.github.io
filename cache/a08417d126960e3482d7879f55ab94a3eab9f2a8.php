<p>Jameela Jamil is taking it easy for the Emmys this year but that doesn't mean she's sacrificing style.</p>

<p>The actress donned an ombre sequin coat dress by Markarian, which features notch lapels, a tie-waist bow and wrap design. We love the pastel colorway which we would be perfect for spring/summer.</p>

<p>Jameela looked sensational as she awaited the ceremony, which will see Jimmy Kimmel host from LA's Staples Centre.</p>

<p>She posed up a storm in sustainable company JJwinks' Slumber Party Top and Happy Hour Pant pyjamas, perfect for staying comfortable while watching several hours of exciting awards coverage.</p>

<p>Making sure to still dress up slightly for the occasion, the Good Place star added a sequin dressing gown to complete her ensemble.  </p>

<p>Dapper: Irish heartthrob and Normal People's nominee Paul Mescal, 24, meanwhile, was dressed to impress in a Louis Vuitton suit as he posed on the stairs ahead of the show</p>

<p>Over the moon: Paul wrote: 'This is nuts. I am wearing <?php echo e('@'); ?>louisvuitton on my stairs for the Emmys! Best of luck to all the nominees x'</p>

<p>Getting glam: The actress, 34, whose show The Good Place is up for several awards, swapped her usual red carpet glamour for pyjamas and a sequin dressing gown</p>

<p>Enjoying it: Jameela said watching the show from her home in pyjamas was her 'kind of vibes' </p>

<p>Alongside her stunning snap, Jameela penned: 'No bra? No heels? NO PROBLEM. </p>

<p>'Wearing PJ's to the 72nd Emmy awards (from my house) is my kind of vibes. Excited to see if we win any of the 7 awards we have been nominated for!!!!</p>

<p>'I still did my make up and wore a sequin dressing gown, because... It's what Tahani would have wanted. And this is her day, not mine.'</p>

<p>Time to get ready: The star shared that she was feeling excited ahead of the show and was going to put some makeup on to watch from home </p>

<p>While on her previous post Jameela wrote: 'Getting ready for the Emmys later on, doing some make up, wearing some stuff.' </p>

<p>Jameela's show The Good Place, in which she plays character Tahani Al-Jamil, is up for several awards during the night including Outstanding Comedy Series. </p>

<p>The actress, who was appearing on video from her home in LA in an interview with E!, said although she was 'sad' not to be at the Staples Centre, it was the 'most comfortable I have ever been at the Emmys'. </p>

<p>Looking good: Jameela appeared to be in good spirits as she gave a thumbs up while appearing on E! during Sunday night</p>

<p>Very cool! Jameela donned a sparkling sequin dressing gown in pastel colours of yellow, blue and pink for her home-viewing of the awards</p>

<p>Stunning: She added a full face of makeup including a touch of eye-liner and lipstick</p>

<p>Normal People's Irish star Paul, meanwhile, scored his nomination for Lead Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his role as Connell, but his co-star Daisy Edgar-Jones and the BBC show were snubbed, a decision he previously insisted was 'disappointing'. </p>

<p>The actor is competing against Jeremy Irons for Watchmen, while The Crown's Helena Bonham Carter and Westworld actress Thandie Newton go head to head for the Supporting Actress in a Drama Series prize.</p>

<p>Ahead of the ceremony, he shared uploaded the black and white snap of himself in the designer two-piece suit and wrote: 'This is nuts. I am wearing <?php echo e('@'); ?>louisvuitton on my stairs for the Emmys! Best of luck to all the nominees x'. </p>

<p>Talking about his nomination and co-star Daisy's, 22, snub, Paul previously told Just Jared: 'It's disappointing because I would love to have shared that with her.'  </p>

<p>Shocked: Earlier this month, Paul admitted that his co-star Daisy's Emmy snub was 'disappointing' </p>

<p>Paul also revealed that the first person he wanted to tell about his exciting Emmy nomination was his mother but he couldn't get in touch.</p>

<p>He added: 'I was trying to voice call everybody on a WhatsApp group, but nobody was picking up. </p>

<p>'I think they were all kind of scared. When I got everybody on the call, it was pretty amazing. My brother who never cries was crying.'</p>

<p>The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards will take place with a largely virtual ceremony due to the pandemic on Sunday night.</p>

<p>Unusual look: Presenters will wear protective attire which looks similar to a tuxedo with a white dress shirt with white sleeve cuffs during the event</p>

<p>Competition: Olivia Colman (L in the Crown) and Jodie Comer (R in Killing Eve) are among the British nominees ahead of this year's Emmy Awards</p>

<p>Producers have sent over 130 home video kits to stars for their remote speeches, and Jimmy Kimmel will anchor the show from the Staples Centre as other presenters are set to deliver gongs to some of winners' homes in full tuxedo hazmat gear. </p>

<p>Host Jimmy, 52, admitted the traditional glitz and glamour could end up a 'beautiful disaster' as the Emmys becomes the latest major awards show to grapple with holding a ceremony during a still-raging pandemic.</p>

<p>Choosing the comedian to emcee the ceremony reverses course from last year's no-host ceremony. </p>

<p>Starry: Other Brit nominees include Succession stars Brian Cox (pictured) and Matthew Macfadyen, who have scooped nods in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor categories</p>

<p>Also among the British nominees are Olivia Colman and Jodie Comer, who are competing for the Best Actress in a Drama Series category for their portrayals as the Queen in The Crown and Oksana Astankova/Villanelle in Killing Eve respectively.  </p>

<p>Screen stars Olivia and Jodie will compete with other big names in the business, including Jennifer Aniston, The Morning Show; Laura Linney, Ozark; Sandra Oh, Killing Eve; and Zendaya, Euphoria.   </p>

<p>Other British nominees include Succession stars Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen, who have scooped nominations in the Lead Actor and Supporting Actor in a Drama Series categories respectively.</p>

<p>He's back: Producers have sent over 130 home video kits to stars for their remote speeches, and Jimmy Kimmel will anchor the show from LA's Staples Centre (pictured in 2016)</p>

<p>Outstanding drama series, considered by many the biggest award on the night, will this year feature The Crown, Better Call Saul, The Handmaid's Tale, Killing Eve, The Mandalorian, Ozark, Stranger Things and Succession. </p>

<p>Jennifer Aniston is nominated for her role in Apple TV+'s The Morning Show, Laura Linney is up for Ozark and Comer's Killing Eve co-star Sandra Oh also grabbed a nod. </p>

<p>HBO's Watchmen is the most nominated show, with 26 nods, including for outstanding limited series.  </p>

<p>Let the crazy begin! Jimmy will host the awards from the Staples Centre in Los Angeles but the nominees will be on video link from their own homes and there will be no live audience</p>
