<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England today recorded 10 more coronavirus deaths in hospitals in the preliminary toll, while Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland announced no new victims. </p>

<p>Government officials have yet to confirm the final daily figure, which takes into account lab-confirmed fatalities in all settings. The early death count for England only includes victims in NHS hospitals, not care homes. Health bosses revealed only one of the victims was under the age of 60.</p>

<p>For comparison, Department of Health chiefs yesterday confirmed 18 more coronavirus deaths and just five were recorded last Monday. But the rate has doubled in a week.</p>

<p>Twenty-one patients are now succumbing to the life-threatening infection every day, on average. The figure — an indicator as to whether the outbreak is growing — stood at just 11 last weekend. But patients can take weeks to die from the illness, meaning any spike in deaths now represents a spike in cases around three weeks ago.</p>

<p>It comes as Sir Patrick Vallance today warned the UK faces 50,000 new daily cases of coronavirus by the middle of October and more than 200 deaths everyday by November, if the spread of Covid-19 is not brought under control as Boris Johnson prepares a fresh crackdown on freedoms.</p>

<p>The Chief Scientific Adviser gave the stark warning as Professor Chris Whitty admitted the UK has 'in a bad sense literally turned a corner' with rising rates of infection and that the nation needs to view the fight against the virus as a 'six month problem' before science eventually can 'ride to our rescue'.</p>
