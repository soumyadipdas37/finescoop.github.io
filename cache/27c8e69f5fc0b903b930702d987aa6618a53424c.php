<p>It is believed that the Coastguard renovated the top-floor of the lighthouse when they used the property as a headquarters in order to give themselves a 360 degree view of the area</p>

<p>Some of the property's rooms, including the main kitchen, are located within the former lighthouse itself.</p>

<p>At one stage in its history, the former lighthouse was also used by the Coastguard who renovated the top floor of the lighthouse to become an observatory that offered a complete 360 degree view of the entire area.  </p>

<p>Speaking about the property, Rhys Jordan, of estate agents Purple Bricks, said: 'For a time it was the Coastguard HQ and so I am guessing it may have been them who added the observation room.'</p>

<p>He said the downstairs accommodation was used as offices during this time. </p>

<p>The floor plan shows just how large the former lighthouse property is. Complete with a garage, porch and multiple bathrooms</p>

<p>The £1million listing also features an indoor swimming pool that boasts an incredible view of the ocean through full-length windows</p>

<p>One of the property's unique selling points is the 360 degree view it provides of the picturesque landscape and coastline nearby</p>

<p>The former lighthouse is so large that it boasts eight bedrooms, four of which have en-suite bathrooms</p>

<p>'The property has been a phenomenally successful holiday let which is great,' he said, 'but the family who own it have decided to take a break from that and this is why they've put it up for sale.'</p>

<p>He believes there are several options a new owner could take.</p>

<p>He said: 'It could easily continue as a holiday let, or as a home and holiday let, depending on what people wanted.</p>

<p>'The owner's daughter used to live here where when she was a child so we know it would make a great family home, too.</p>

<p>Feeling blue: One of the bathrooms in the £1million former lighthouse property. It has been decorated with the sea in mind with walls and panels all painted blue</p>

<p>The incredible property also features a garden terrace that offers an incredible ocean view and plenty of seating</p>

<p>Pictured: On top of the dizzying array of bedrooms and bathrooms, the former lighthouse also comes with an in-built games room</p>

<p>Nautical-themed cushions are used to decorate this living room - one of five reception rooms in the property on sale for just under £1million</p>

<p>The former lighthouse includes this large joint living and dining room separated by an ornate brick fireplace in the centre of the room</p>

<p>'It's a unique location and living here would be a unique experience - there aren't that many lighthouses that come up for sale.'</p>

<p>The lighthouse also benefits from being located on a peninsula which is often reported to be the sunniest place in Wales with very low levels of rainfall. </p>

<p>The area is also regarded as a premier spot for British wildlife, with colonies of kittiwakes, Manx shearwaters, gannets and puffins nearby, as well as dolphins being regularly spotted in the local waters. </p>
