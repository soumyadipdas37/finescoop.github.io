<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Marcelo Bielsa has not fared well in English cup competition since his arrival two years ago - and not even the inclusion of £27million club-record signing Rodrigo could help him here as Leeds crashed out on penalties.</p>

<p>It was another outing to forget for the Spain striker, who conceded the late penalty that cost his side a point during their opening-day defeat at Liverpool at the weekend.</p>

<p>Rodrigo did step up first and confidently dispatched in the shootout, but his team-mates could not prevail and Hull won 9-8 with Alfie Jones netting the winner.</p>

<p>Hull celebrate after beating Leeds United in a penalty shootout on Wednesday night</p>

<p>It means Bielsa has still not made it beyond this stage of the Carabao Cup, while his record in the FA Cup reads played two, lost two.</p>

<p>Yes, his side showed XI changes from Liverpool, but Bielsa would have expected far more, especially with Rodrigo given his first start. He, however, barely had a kick of note until the shootout.</p>

<p>Leeds could not live with their former striker Mallik Wilks early on and he could - and probably should - have had a hat-trick by half-time.</p>

<p>Alfie Jones scored the decisive penalty after Leeds had been fortunate to force a draw</p>

<p>His goal, on five minutes, owed a little to a deflection off defender Leif Davis after he had taken aim from 18 yards following an intricate approach. And he was only denied a second when Kiko Casilla spread his frame to block a 12-yard shot moments later.</p>

<p>It was not just Wilks who Leeds’ young backline were struggling to contain and Keane Lewis-Porter curled agonisingly wide after escaping inside the area.</p>

<p>Leeds were better after half-time - it was hard not to be - and 20-year-old winger Ian Poveda embarked on one daring mazy only to be knocked off stride with the trigger cocked just yards from goal.</p>

<p>Mallik Wilks appeared to have sunk his former club with a deflected early first-half effort</p>

<p>Hull looked the more likely scorers of a second as Bielsa left Kalvin Phillips, Jack Harrison and Patrick Bamford tracksuited on the touchline, revealing where his priorities lie.</p>

<p>But Ezgjan Alioski lashed an equaliser four minutes into injury-time. It was, however, all in vain.</p>

<p>Wilks, one of three Hull players facing his former club, fired the visitors into a fifth-minute lead</p>
