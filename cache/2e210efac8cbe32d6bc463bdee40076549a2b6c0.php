<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Queen Mathilde proved you don't have to compromise safety to look stylish as she stepped out in a matching dress and face mask in Brussels. </p>

<p>The royal, 47, was on hand to open the new interactive and digital financial education center, Wikifin Lab, developed by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA).</p>

<p>The aim of the lab is to put teenagers through everyday life financial situations in order to prepare them better for adult life. </p>

<p>Mathilde, who has diligently respected all the safety rules put in place to reduce the spread of covid-19, wore a face covering mad in the same fabric as her dress. </p>

<p>She looked relaxed as she visited the centre with members of its staff and local teenagers, also all wearing masks. </p>

<p>Queen Mathilde married safety and style together by pairing her sanitary mask to her dress during an outing today. The mother-of-four, 47, was in Brussels to open the new interactive and digital financial education center, Wikifin Lab</p>

<p>The mother-of-four  looked relaxed as she visited the centre with members of its staff and local teenagers, also all wearing masks</p>

<p>Making the most of the gentle early September weather, the Belgian royal opted by a blue and white summer dress.</p>

<p>She wore it casually with the sleeves rolled up. The number was adorned with a graphic blue, grey and white motif.</p>

<p>Mathilde paired it with a clutch bag in eggshell and heels of the same colour. </p>

<p>Her mask, which she kept on for the duration of the visit, was made of the same fabric as the dress. </p>

<p>The Belgian royal wore the dress and mask with statement earrings and a slim silver bracelet and watch </p>

<p>The Queen listened intently during the visit while a member of staff talked her through the different interactive exercises offered by the centre </p>

<p>She kept her jewellery to a minimum, only wearing a slim silver watch on her left wrist, with another silver bracelet. </p>

<p>As always paying attention to the details of her outfit, she also donned a pair of statement earrings matching her bag and heels.   </p>

<p>Mathilde's blond locks bounced on her shoulders in a natural blow-dry as she walked around the premises. </p>

<p>She wore a discreet trait of eyeliner and mascara to bring the focus to her blue eyes. </p>

<p>The royal seemed relaxed as she followed the staff around the new facility, accompanied by a small group of teenagers, all wearing masks. </p>

<p>Mathilde was joined on her visit by members of staff and a small group of teenagers, today. The centre is aimed to help secondary school students learn about financial matters and how to deal with them </p>

<p>The Wikifin Lab aims to better prepare teenagers to deal with financial matters later in life.  </p>

<p>The course at the centre lasts for three hours and follows an interactive method where second school students will be confronted with everyday financial matters that they will be expected to face in their adult life.  </p>

<p>The Lab offers both individual and group exercises supervised by a member of staff. </p>

<p>Mathilde looked back at the group of students accompanying her on the tour during their visit today</p>

<p> Mathilde paired her mask to her outfit, and picked a smart clutch bag in eggshells as an accessory </p>

<p>The Queen, whose own children are teenagers, looked in her element during the visit at the Wikifin lab</p>

<p>Princess Eleonore, Mathilde's youngest, 12, just started secondary school and will be among the Lab's target audience. </p>

<p>The Belgian queen also matched her mask to her outfit when she accompanied her daughter on her first day or school with King Philippe last week. </p>

<p>The family all sported masks when arriving at Heilig-Hartcollege in Wezembeek-Oppem, and the young princess opted for a pink top and jeans, while carrying her school bag. </p>

<p>All schools in Belgium are resuming on-site teaching from the start of the new academic year this month. </p>

<p>For students in secondary education, the current plan means they will go to school four days a week and distance-learn on Wednesdays. </p>

<p>Princess Eleonore did want to continue her studies at Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege, having completed her primary school education there, according to local media.</p>

<p>However, she had to accept her second choice of Heilig-Hartcollege because she doesn't have an older sibling at Sint-Jan Berchmanscollege and lives outside the catchment area.</p>

<p>Heilig-Hartcollege is a Dutch language catholic secondary school in the Brussels region.</p>
