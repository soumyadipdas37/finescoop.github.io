<p>Errands: Nikki Bella was spotted emerging from her car to fill up her tank at a Los Angeles gas station this Thursday</p>

<p>At the start of the week she posted an Instagram video showing her post-baby body and declaring she had 18lbs left to lose to reach her weight before getting pregnant. </p>

<p>She attributed some of her weight gain to diet as well saying: 'I indulged in pizza quite a bit especially towards the end and baked goods.'</p>

<p>The retired wrestler explained: 'I have to take full accountability, so I am now in a journey to lose 18 pounds, but in the most healthiest way possible because I’m breastfeeding obviously, and giving my son the most amazing nutrition is No. 1, so there’s going to be no crash-diets, no starving myself.' </p>
