<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Saracens revved their engine for their European quarter-final with a six-try win over London Irish completed in second-gear.</p>

<p>Another Premiership match bereft of meaning or drama limped by unremarkably - but for Sarries it was a useful tune-up before Leinster on September 19. </p>

<p>Relegated Saracens might be now one point behind Leicester if their original 35-point deduction for salary cap breaches had stood, but as it is they move to the minus 40s having beaten up a rotated Irish. </p>

<p>Richard Barrington of Saracens scores his side's fifth try of the game against London Irish</p>

<p>They scored most of their tries from close range with Jamie George and Richard Barrington taking two each, Brad Barritt and Billy Vunipola the others.</p>

<p>But it is all about Leinster preparations for Saracens. </p>

<p>'We're not quite where we need to be but individuals are playing well,' said director of rugby Mark McCall. </p>

<p>'We're building towards that of course and playing a game like today that has less meaning it's always going to feel different.</p>

<p>'Leinster have won every match they've played since they lost the European final last May to us - I saw them against Munster and they were excellent.</p>

<p>'They were phenomenal again against a stacked Ulster team too. They've got huge momentum and have a semi and a final before us, presuming they win the semi, but if we get our best team on the park we'll give them a run for their money.</p>

<p>The match was a useful tune-up for Mark McCall's Sarries before Leinster on September 19</p>

<p>'We don't quite have the depth we had in the past but fingers crossed we get there healthy, then we stand a chance.' In honing for Leinster it seemed the rolling maul was the skill Saracens fancied practicing this time, and four of their six tries came from that set-piece.</p>

<p>George had two, Barritt nicked one off him and Barrington took another in the second half.</p>

<p>The other scores were from close range too - Billy Vunipola tapping and going from a penalty and Barrington scoring again after strong forward-play. Manu Vunipola kicked five conversions.</p>

<p>Irish scored twice - once from Agustin Creevy on debut and the other when Matt Williams benefited from Maro Itoje throwing a pass to the floor.</p>

<p>Owen Farrell and Mako Vunipola should be fit for Wasps on Saturday after quad and back knocks as Saracens drive towards Dublin at pace. </p>
