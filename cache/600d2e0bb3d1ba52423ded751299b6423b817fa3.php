<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Protesters in Portland gathered outside Democrat mayor Ted Wheeler's apartment Monday night to 'celebrate' his birthday by letting off fireworks and singing 'happy tear gas to you'. </p>

<p>A fire was lit in the street outside the 58-year-old's apartment block in an upmarket area in the north of the city, as around 200 people gathered while blasting music, sounding horns, banging pots and pans, and playing drums.</p>

<p>Activists - some of whom were carrying balloons and wearing party hats - danced to the Macarena and were heard shouting slogans including 'Black Lives Matter'.</p>

<p>Protesters in Portland gathered outside mayor Ted Wheeler's apartment building on Monday night to 'celebrate' his birthday by starting a fire in the street and letting off fireworks</p>

<p>Police moved in after looters broke into a business and started a fire in the lobby, which was underneath an occupied apartment building</p>

<p>Protesters blared music, let off fireworks, sounded horns and banged drums before officers moved in and dispersed them</p>

<p>Police arrived around 11pm after fires were started in the street, declared the scene a riot, and ordered the demonstrators to leave, KOIN reported.</p>

<p>When they refused, officers charged at the crowd and made arrests. It is unclear exactly how many people were arrested. </p>

<p>Videos showed a trash can and picnic table were set on fire, with other pieces of furniture from outside nearby businesses added to the flames.</p>

<p>Marchers stood nearby holding a large sign that said 'resign'. </p>

<p>Additional footage showed windows had been smashed at several nearby businesses, including what appeared to be a dentist's office.</p>

<p>The building had also been daubed with graffiti while a small fire had been started in the lobby.</p>

<p>Activists also danced to the 'Macarena' and sang 'Happy tear gas, war crimes Wheeler/Happy tear gas to you,' to the tune of 'Happy Birthday', KATU reported.</p>

<p>Monday marked the 95th consecutive day of demonstrations in Portland, which began after the killing of George Floyd during his arrest in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Protesters had started gathering in the north of Portland around 8pm before making their way to the mayor's apartment, where fires were lit shortly before 11pm</p>

<p>Police arrived on the scene at 11pm, declared the gathering a riot, and were then filmed charging the crowd and making arrests</p>

<p>Some of the demonstrators carried party balloons and wore birthday hats, while others carried large signs telling the mayor to 'resign' </p>

<p>A man with a megaphone and clutching something in his left hand speaks to the crowd, which had blocked a street in the north of Portland</p>

<p>On Sunday night, activists had targeted a police building at the Penubra Kelly Building, with the gathering quickly declared unlawful after projectiles were thrown.</p>

<p>Police said that 29 arrests were made after the crowd refused to disperse. One was charged with illegal possession of a firearm, while most were charged with disorderly conduct or interfering with an officer.</p>

<p>Tensions ratcheted up in the city after 39-year-old Aaron 'Jay' Bishop, a member of the right-wing pro-Trump group Patriot Prayer, was shot dead overnight Saturday.</p>

<p>Video showed what appeared to be a man following Bishop down the street before gunshots rang out, leaving him sprawled on the floor.</p>

<p>A person of interest to the investigation has since been identified as Michael Forest Reinoehl, a 48-year-old father-of-two who described himself online as '100% antifa'.</p>

<p>Reinoehl's estranged sister said she confirmed to police that she recognised her brother in screenshots from the night in question.</p>

<p>Police have yet to confirm the man's identity, and he has not been formally arrested. </p>

<p>'On the one hand, this whole thing surprises the daylights out of us, because we always thought he is a lot of bark, not a lot of bite. But he's also been very impulsive and irrational,' she said.</p>

<p>Police said they moved in to clear the crowd after a business was burgled and furniture dragged into the street where it was set on fire (remains of the fire above)</p>

<p>In total police say 19 people were arrested, some of whom were carrying knives and a collapsible baton, after vandals attacked a nearby business</p>

<p>Walls were daubed with graffiti by some members of the protest group, prompting police to declare the gathering a riot and move in</p>

<p>'Violence begets violence and hatred begets hatred. This is not the solution. My heart goes out to the victim. It always has, before I even knew my brother was involved.'</p>

<p>She claimed her brother is troubled and that they have not been in touch for three years. </p>

<p>In the past, she said he'd stolen their mother's seizure medication and is in debt. </p>

<p>He has a son and daughter from a previous relationship but is no longer involved with the mother.</p>

<p>President Trump has since weighed in on the situation, threatening to send the National Guard to Portland to quell the violence.</p>

<p>'Rest in peace Jay!', he said, after learning of Danielson's death.</p>

<p>He then tweeted: 'Portland is a mess, and it has been for many years. If this joke of a mayor doesn't clean it up, we will go in and do it for them!' he wrote.</p>

<p>'The Radical Left Mayors &amp; Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their 'movement'.</p>

<p>'It wasn't supposed to be like this, but the Anarchists &amp; Agitators got carried away and don't listen anymore - even force Slow Joe out of basement!'</p>
