<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>UFC star Israel Adesanya says he is keen on fighting again this year following his brilliant victory against Paulo Costa at the weekend. </p>

<p>The 31-year-old silenced his critics with a comprehensive win over rival Costa, a formerly undefeated Brazilian, and the pair had not seen eye to eye in the build up to their bout on Fight Island. </p>

<p>Following his dominant second-round win, Adesanya made a series of lewd comments in the direction of his rival's corner but he was much more relaxed when speaking on the Ariel Helwasni MMA Show on Wednesday.   </p>

<p>Israel Adesanya says he is keen on fighting again this year after his demolition job at UFC 253</p>

<p>The 31-year-old told the Ariel Helwasni MMA Show that he is fresh and eager to fight soon</p>

<p>When asked when he could return and against who, Adesanya said: 'I don't know, I've got to talk to the big dog. </p>

<p>But when probed on whether that could mean in March or April next year, he replied: 'What? Don't be silly, I'm fresh. What?! Are you serious?</p>

<p>'This year, I want to fight this year. We talked a little a bit last night and I can't say much more but we've got some plans, I want to fight this year.</p>

<p>'I'm fresh. My foot only hurts from kicking his a***. But I can't tell you yet...'</p>

<p>In a year overshadowed by cancelled events due to the coronavirus crisis, Adesanya has fought twice: at the weekend and in March, when he defeated Yoel Romero at UFC 248.  </p>

<p>Despite his weekend victory Adesanya - who stretched his MMA pro record to 20-0 - has faced criticism for his antics at the end of the fight on Saturday night. </p>

<p>Adesanya appeared to 'hump' the stricken Paulo Costa at the end of their UFC bout</p>

<p>He appeared to 'hump' his rival shortly after referee Jason Herzog called a stop to the contest, and then strolled around the octagon, launching an angry tirade for everyone to hear.</p>

<p>'I wrap my d*** around my waist it's a black belt, motherf*****' he said, in reference to the white belt gimmick from Costa in the build-up to the title bout. </p>

<p>The 31-year-old then went onto break-dance while Costa was still receiving treatment from doctors just feet away. </p>
