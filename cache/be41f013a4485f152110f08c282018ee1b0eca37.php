<p>'A tan is a non-negotiable for me. I feel better mentally and physically when I have a tan,' she said.</p>

<p>Elle admitted that while she's enjoying 'not having to wear makeup every day', she's been using the time to try out new looks.</p>

<p>'I am literally trying every product I have in my makeup and skincare drawer. It's so much fun as I never usually have this time to play.</p>

<p>Elle, who is engaged to former AFL player Joel Patfull, also revealed exercise has been keeping the couple sane while in isolation.</p>

<p>'I am very blessed to live with a professional athlete, so Joel and I invested in a treadmill when the lockdown began and it's been keeping us both sane,' she said.</p>

<p>'We have been setting ourselves challenges everyday. It's hard but it's so rewarding, particularly as I've really only just started running recently.'</p>
