<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The New York City Health Department has threatened to close non-essential businesses where COVID-19 cases are on the rise. </p>

<p>Officials gave the warning on Wednesday, following an alarming uptick of new cases in six neighborhoods across Brooklyn and Queens.  </p>

<p>Brooklyn's Midwood, Borough Park, Bensonhurst and South Williamsburg, as well as Queens' Far Rockaway and Kew Gardens, now account for 20 percent of all new infections across the Big Apple. </p>

<p>The city's Health Department say they could curb activities in those neighborhoods as early as next Tuesday. </p>

<p>The New York City Health Department has threatened to close non-essential businesses  in six neighborhoods where COVID-19 cases are on the rise</p>

<p>'If the indicators continue to rise, there must be additional enforcement actions,' the department said in a statement. </p>

<p>'For the first time in the city's recovery period, there could be the immediate scaling back of activities in these ZIP codes if progress is not made by Monday evening.' </p>

<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio also addressed the concerning situation, stating:  'We have a lot to do because we're seeing a serious uptick in multiple neighborhoods simultaneously and it's something we have to address with a very aggressive public health effort right away.'</p>

<p>In the meantime,  Health Department workers are being deployed to the areas to distribute face masks and hand sanitizer. Mobile testing sites will also be set up. </p>

<p>The impacted neighborhoods are all home to substantial Orthodox Jewish populations - but Mayor de Blasio has not singled out those communities for the spike. </p>

<p>Back in April, de Blasio personally oversaw the dispersal of a Hasidic funeral in Williamsburg  and weathered criticism over a tweet warning 'the Jewish community, and all communities' to heed the virus.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of the city's public hospital system, said health officials are meeting with religious leaders in the hard-hit neighborhoods, making robocalls in English and Yiddish and sending sound trucks to flood the streets with messages about virus guidelines.</p>

<p>The Big Apple was once the global epicenter of the coronavirus crisis, before residents managed to flatten the curve. </p>

<p>While overall infection rate remains low, the city reported 986 new cases of the virus on September 19 - the highest daily infection rate since early June. </p>

<p>On Thursday, that number was down a little to 955. </p>

<p>In contrast, the city was frequently reporting upwards of 7,000 coronavirus cases every day during the peak of the crisis back in April and May.  </p>

<p>While overall infection rate remains low, the city reported 986 new cases of the virus on September 19 - the highest daily infection rate since early June. Residents are seen out about about in Manhattan on that day</p>
