<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David Alaba is yet to agree a new Bayern Munich contract and wants to leave in this transfer window so the club receive a fee for him. </p>

<p>The defender has just one year remaining on his current deal at the club and would be able to leave for free next summer. </p>

<p>According to BILD, the 28-year-old wants to ensure Bayern, the club he has spent his entire senior career, picks up a transfer fee if they cannot agree improved terms. </p>

<p>David Alaba helped Bayern Munich win the Champions League but he could be leaving soon</p>

<p>Alaba has not yet agreed new terms with Bayern and wants to leave in this transfer window</p>

<p>Manchester United and Chelsea have both previously been linked with the Austrian, who played 40 times for Bayern last season, a campaign that culminated in their Champions League triumph.</p>

<p>Sky Germany reported last month that Alaba's advisors had held contract talks in Lisbon with Bayern chiefs, and an offer of £13.5m-a-year was rejected.</p>

<p>It is believed the two parties are some way off with Alaba keen to become one of the club's top earners which currently includes Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller.</p>

<p>The vastly experienced and versatile defender would be an attractive prospect for a number of sides across Europe, particularly on a cut price deal. </p>

<p>Alaba, 28, wants Bayern to receive a transfer fee rather than let him leave for free </p>

<p>It remains to be see what kind of transfer fee would be acceptable to Bayern. The German champions are demanding £27million from Thiago Alcantara's suitors and he has the same amount of time left on his contract. </p>

<p>Alaba has played in central midfield, central defence and on the wing but his primary role is as at left-back. </p>

<p>Given that Chelsea have just splashed out on Ben Chilwell it seems unlikely that Roman Abramovich would sanction the sale to continue the Blues' spending spree. </p>

<p>Alaba is eager to have his future sorted as swiftly as possible but he faces a race against time for a resolution before the new season begins. </p>

<p>Bayern host Schalke at the Allianz Arena on September 18 to launch their title defence.</p>

<p>Alaba has been at Bayern for the entirety of his senior career having left Austria</p>
