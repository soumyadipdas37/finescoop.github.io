<p>Earlier this month, Miley spoke out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the recent MTV Video Music Awards, where she performed the song for the first time.  </p>

<p>Appreciation: Miley has often offered up covers of hit songs including Jolene by Dolly Parton, who is her godmother</p>

<p>Covered: The musicians on stage with her wore black face masks amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>The Midnight Sky singer made the claim during her chat with Joe Rogan on his Joe Rogan Experience podcast, detailing the incident. </p>

<p>She began explaining how she'd requested for the lights to be turned off during her performance - including a 'beauty light' used specifically for female performers - which ruffled some feathers with a director. </p>

<p>'I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s****,' she said, saying: 'I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light.'</p>

<p>'The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f******g lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn't turn the beauty light off.' </p>

<p>Technical difficulties: Earlier this month, Miley spoke out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the recent MTV Video Music Awards</p>

<p>The pop star continued: 'They said, "Okay, we'll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys," because that's what I want.' </p>

<p>'And then something that I was doing... for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s***t and they said, '"you want to be treated like a guy? We wouldn't be dealing with this if a guy was doing it."' </p>

<p>'And I said, "Well a guy wouldn't be doing this because a guy doesn't sell your show with sex the way that I'm going to,"' she divulged. 'And I'm aware of that. It's a ridiculous conversation and also embarrassing.'</p>

<p>Miley's performance saw her stride across a giant disco ball on stage as she held onto a chain in a skimpy pair of pants. </p>
