<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For many, the thought of battling crowds to do the Christmas shopping will put plans of an annual festive trip into jeopardy. </p>

<p>But John Lewis has launched an online feature that means customers can 'visit' its Oxford Street department store without leaving their sofa. </p>

<p>The retailer has released a virtual tour of the festive pop-up on its website, allowing shoppers to 'walk' through the space and admire the displays of festive table settings and twinkling Christmas trees. </p>

<p>In the virtual tour (pictured), the flagship shop boasts the largest ever Christmas Tree forest, showcasing seven new festive trends and room sets as well as a one stop gift emporium</p>

<p>When it comes time to buy, there is the option of clicking on individual products or sections, which leads customers to the corresponding section of its online shop - and the item can be purchased in just a few clicks. </p>

<p>Dan Cooper, partner and head of Christmas at John Lewis &amp; Partners said: 'We know that Christmas might look a little different to our customers this year, with smaller celebrations at home and video calls to loved ones. </p>

<p>'But we also know that many are looking forward to the small joys that the festive season brings: from decorated fireplaces to wreaths on doors.</p>

<p>'This year we have created a Christmas shop that will of course delight and inspire our customers but we have also focused on making it a simple journey that means they can tick off their list happily and safely.' </p>

<p>Using a computer, smartphone or tablet, people can take a virtual stroll through the shop, clicking through the steps in the virtual shop to see this year's Christmas themes brought to life</p>

<p>The measure has been introduced as high street retailers brace for a different - and challenging - festive season, with questions over how many shoppers will be willing to venture out to usually busy high streets. </p>

<p>John Lewis has reported an earlier than usual interest in Christmas shopping, with festive sales up by 112 per cent compared to the same period in 2019. </p>

<p>The retailer will be hoping Christmas will be a time to reverse its fortunes. </p>

<p>Earlier this month John Lewis axed its staff bonus for the first time since 1953 after losing £635million in six months and closing eight stores. </p>

<p>The group said it plunged to the pre-tax loss for the half year ended July 25 after being impacted by a £470million write-down on its stores.  </p>

<p> Those wishing to browse all that is on offer at the flagship store customers can pick up their computers, smartphones or tablets and take a look without even leaving the house</p>
