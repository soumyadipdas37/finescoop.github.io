<p>Olivia has been celebrating two years of marriage with husband Alex recently, with the pair dining at London's Scott's last Tuesday and STK the following evening. </p>

<p>The lovebirds also pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.</p>

<p>Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together. </p>

<p>The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance.  </p>

<p>When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.</p>

<p>'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.</p>

<p>'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.</p>

<p>'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.' </p>
