<p>The number of credit card deals offering interest-free balance transfers has tumbled to a record low of 54. </p>

<p>The fall, from 76 at the start of the year, will hit customers particularly hard as the UK endures its first recession in 11 years. </p>

<p>Fall: The number of credit card deals offering interest-free balance transfers has tumbled to a record low of 54</p>

<p>Job losses and salary cuts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have spurred several borrowers into trying to pay off their credit cards, and savvy customers will be looking to consolidate their debts interest-free. </p>

<p>But Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, said borrowers 'would be wise to consider a new deal soon, as the market is contracting'. </p>

<p>She added: 'The number of offers available to consumers has dropped since the start of 2020 and the fall echoes that seen during the past recession. </p>

<p>'Typically, credit card providers would rein in lucrative offers during a period of economic uncertainty so that they are not taking on too much risk. </p>

<p>'As experienced during the recession between 2007 and 2009, credit card providers pulled interest-free balance transfer cards and, since the start of January, the market has already felt a similar contraction thanks to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.' </p>

<p>She also warned borrowers hoping to swtich to be wary of balance transfer fees. </p>

<p>'Since the start of 2020, the average balance transfer fee has crept up from 2.27 per cent to 2.32 per cent,' she said.</p>
