<p>It comes after The Great British Bake Off scored record views for Channel 4 when it returned for series 11 on September 22.</p>

<p>7.9 million tuned in to see Matt Lucas' first episode as the new co-host and 12 home bakers compete in the first drama-filled challenges.</p>

<p>The show marked the biggest Great British Bake Off launch Channel 4 has seen since it started airing the show in 2017, following seven years at the BBC.  </p>

<p>Ruth said: 'I had absolute horrific hallucinations. I couldn't look at him because he turned into a kind of monster, and my arms, the flesh dripped off them'</p>

<p>Tuesday night's series premiere beat last year’s opening episode by a huge 1.3 million viewers, and surpassed the broadcaster’s first ever episode in 2017 by 500,000.</p>

<p>The peak of 7.9 million (average audience 6.9 million) marks Channel 4’s biggest broadcast of 2020 to date and the channel’s highest rating broadcast since the series nine final of Bake Off in 2018.</p>

<p>The start of Tuesday night's show was delayed by 15 minutes to make room for Prime Minister Boris Johnson's address at 8pm, which three million people tuned in for on Channel 4.</p>

<p>All 12 bakers, presenters Matt Lucas and Noel Fielding, judges Prue Leith and Paul Hollywood along with the entire crew lived together in an isolation bubble for six weeks in order to film. </p>

<p>Side effects: Prue admitted the experience left her with nightmares for several decades</p>

<p>The production took over luxury hotel Down Hall in Hertfordshire with all cast and crew living together on site for the duration of the shoot, undergoing regular COVID-19 testing and living away from their families.</p>

<p>This allowed the bakers and the judges and presenters to forgo social distancing in the famous tent.</p>

<p>The series had already seen it's start date pushed back by a month from its usual late August slot after filming was delayed by lockdown.</p>

<p>The production worked to ensure COVID-19 restrictions would not impact the close-knit nature of the show.</p>

<p>Success: It comes after The Great British Bake Off scored record views for Channel 4 when it returned for series 11 on September 22 with 7.9million tuning in</p>
