<p>Bronze has established herself as England's best player and was poached from City by Lyon in 2017, where she went on to win a glut of trophies. </p>

<p>'I'm really happy to be back here at City – I always had it in my mind that I would return one day, and it just feels like the perfect time and opportunity right now,' Bronze, 28, said. </p>

<p>'I really enjoyed my time in France, but there were so many things that I missed and it's great to be back.</p>

<p>'I feel like I'm returning as a better leader and person, who is capable of bringing similar success to the table here in England – both domestically with City and internationally too.</p>

<p>Bronze lifts the trophy in her final game for Lyon as they beat Wolfsburg in Women's Champions League final held in San Sebastian, Spain, last month</p>

<p>'Having already experienced everything that City have to offer as a Club, it was a no-brainer for me when the offer came in and there isn't another team in England that I would have looked at.</p>

<p>'There's nowhere I'd rather be right now than with Manchester City and I'm really excited to see what the future holds with the exciting squad we have here.'  </p>

<p>Bronze's arrival means they have 10 recognised England internationals to call upon for the WSL season.</p>

<p>As well as Bronze, head coach Gareth Taylor has Steph Houghton, Ellie Roebuck, Jill Scott, Demi Stokes, Esme Morgan, Keira Walsh, Georgia Stanway, Chloe Kelly and Ellen White in his squad. </p>

<p>Taylor described Bronze's return as 'incredibly exciting' for the club and believes her 'unrivalled talent' can give City an edge over rivals Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United. </p>

<p>England international Bronze has 'unrivalled talent', according to City boss Gareth Taylor </p>

<p>'We're absolutely thrilled to see Lucy return to Manchester City and I'm sure I speak on behalf of everyone when I say that we're delighted to have her back at the Club,' he said.</p>

<p>'She is an unrivalled talent and her endless individual and team awards only scratch the surface of what a superb player she is, not only at Club level, but also internationally with England.</p>

<p>'She joins us off the back of a hugely successful few years in France and being able to add a player of her quality to our already ambitious squad is incredibly exciting.'</p>
