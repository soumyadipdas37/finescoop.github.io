<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two best friends who live in different states made more than a million dollars selling infrared sauna blankets during coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>Melbourne-based Ed Hodge, 26, and Brisbane-based Wyatt Westmoreland, 23, launched E-commerce business MiHIGH in May after a successful test run in April. </p>

<p>In just four months, the young businessmen reached one million dollars in revenue - despite not being able to see each other due to border closures brought on by a deadly second wave of COVID-19 infections in Melbourne.</p>

<p>'The only downside to the success is we have we haven't been able to share it together,' Mr Westmoreland told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>The blankets - which can burn up to 600 calories in 45 minutes - allow users to enjoy the benefits of an infrared sauna in the comfort of their own home. </p>

<p>The best mates, who have backgrounds in E-commerce and marketing, always knew they wanted to run a business together. </p>

<p>Passionate about the health and wellness space, the pair spent the past couple of years conducting research and learning about what 'works' with consumers.</p>

<p>Mr Westmoreland came up with their breakthrough business idea as he sat in an infrared sauna. </p>

<p>He quickly texted Mr Hodge and suggested the pair looking into 'portable' infrared sauna blankets. </p>

<p>'We did a bit of research and it fit the criteria,' Mr Hodge said. </p>

<p>MiHIGH was officially launched in Australia and the UK in May following a test run in April. The blankets hit the US market in June. </p>

<p>MiHIGH was officially launched in Australia and the UK in May following a test run in April. The blankets hit the US market in June</p>

<p>'In the beginning, it was scary,' Mr Westmoreland said. </p>

<p>'Everyone was uncertain as to what would happen.'</p>

<p>But the pair quickly learnt lockdown was a blessing in disguise for their venture, with Australians unable to visit wellness centres and encouraged to stay at home. </p>

<p>'By the time we were fully launched, we realised we couldn't have launched a better product at a better time,' Mr Westmoreland said.</p>

<p>'It was perfect.' </p>

<p>MiHIGH hit $1million in August after making $200,000 in both May and June and $400,000 in July.  </p>

<p>Passionate about the health and wellness space, the pair spent the past couple of years conducting research and learning about what 'works' with consumers</p>

<p>The revenue is now heading towards $1.5million and the pair hope to make $5million within one year of trading. </p>

<p>They are also looking to expand and hope to launch more brands within the health and wellness space. </p>

<p>The two business partners haven't seen each other since March but have been able to work efficiently with 'good online systems', 'years of experience in E-commerce', 'constant communication' and by holding each other accountable.  </p>

<p>'Last time we saw each other would have been early March. I was in Brisbane staying at Wyatt's,' Mr Hodge said.</p>

<p>'Coronavirus started coming and I went back to Melbourne.</p>

<p>'We haven't seen each other since we launched.'</p>

<p>Mr Hodge admitted Melbourne's Stage Four coronavirus lockdown had been tough despite having a successful business and being able to work online.</p>

<p>There are three core benefits for using MiHIGH: 'Detoxify', 'Calm Your Mind' and 'Burn Calories'</p>

<p>There are three core benefits for using MiHIGH: 'Detoxify', 'Calm Your Mind' and 'Burn Calories'.</p>

<p>The infrared heat allows users to sweat out both water and toxins, providing an effective detox.</p>

<p>The blankets mean users can 'work out, without working out', as studies have shown that infrared saunas can burn anywhere from 200 to 600 calories per session.   </p>

<p>'The third and final benefit is calming the body and the mind,' Mr Westmoreland said. </p>

<p>'The heat can really relax your muscles. Good for recovery. The 40 minutes in the blanket is a good time to relax.'  </p>

<p>The MiHIGH website reads: 'From celebrities to global sports stars, infrared saunas are being praised for their benefits on body and mind. </p>

<p>'MiHIGH's infrared blanket brings all of these benefits directly to your home.'</p>
