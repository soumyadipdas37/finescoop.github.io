<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pete Evan's wife Nicola Robinson is rarely-seen in public, instead spending most of her days holed up at the couple's $1.2 million farm in northern NSW.</p>

<p>But on Thursday, the former Playboy model, 42, stepped out to purchase items from a local supermarket in Byron Bay.</p>

<p>Nicola cut a casual figure in a sheer white blouse and black tight pants as she visited the shops after leaving her husband's Evolve Health Labs clinic.</p>

<p>Out and about: Pete Evans' rarely-seen wife Nicola Robinson (pictured) cut a chic figure in a sheer blouse as she picked up supplies in Byron Bay on Thursday</p>

<p>The Kiwi-born beauty appeared to go makeup free for the outing, and styled her long brunette locks out.</p>

<p>She completed her outfit with a pair of sneakers and held a tote bag on her shoulder while holding a basket in her other hand.</p>

<p>Before entering the shops, Nicola was spotted standing outside on the footpath and glancing at her mobile phone.</p>

<p>Nicola is believed to be working at Pete's Byron Bay Evolve Health Labs clinic, which offers 'transformational practices' such as 'cold and conscious breath-work'.</p>

<p>Nicola, who describes herself as 'moon gazing farm girl' and 'nutritional mermaid', has raised eyebrows in recent years with her unusual beliefs about health and spirituality.</p>

<p>She also received media attention in 2017, when she went under the knife to have her 'toxic' breast implants removed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Pete has also been embroiled in a string of controversies since departing Channel Seven earlier this year.</p>

<p>He was recently invited on 60 Minutes to share his bizarre conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and the 5G network. </p>

<p>Despite sharing misleading information about immunisation over the years, Pete has insisted he is not an 'anti-vaxxer' but 'pro-choice for medical freedom'.</p>

<p>However, there is no such thing as being 'pro-choice' regarding vaccinations. People who do not vaccinate their children are putting the community at unnecessary risk.</p>

<p>Pete has claimed on several occasions that vaccines cause autism, but this is false and based on a scientific paper that was later exposed as fraudulent. </p>

<p>Nicola and Pete began dating in 2012, and married in a barefoot wedding ceremony on their picturesque property near Round Mountain in 2016.</p>
