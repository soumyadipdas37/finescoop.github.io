<p>'They could've killed him. These people need to be held to justice and accountable. The police had no right to do what they did,' he told reporters on Monday.</p>

<p>Mr Atkins is calling on Victoria Police to sack the officer who allegedly kicked his son.</p>

<p>'It's disgusting,' he told 3AW.</p>

<p>'This bloke needs to be accountable. He needs to lose his job. Policemen like that should not be in the job.'</p>

<p>He explained his son, who is a successful business owner and just finished building his dream home, was suffering through his first bipolar episode in nine years. </p>

<p>He had tried to admit himself to a psychiatric ward in the hospital on Saturday but was unable to secure a bed after a day-long wait.</p>

<p>'He called me on Saturday. He was crying and he wanted me to come in,' Glen said.</p>

<p>'I can't, because of the COVID thing, and he started crying on the phone.'</p>

<p>His father Glen (pictured) was furious about the incident that left his son in an induced coma with potential brain damage</p>

<p>Six officers pounced on the man, with one officer allegedly kicking him in the head</p>

<p>His son called his apprentice to pick him up before he ran out the front door of the hospital.</p>

<p>Glen said his son was considered to be a 'danger to himself' and doctors rang the police.  </p>

<p>He claimed the matter got out of hand when police arrived on scene and attempted to apprehend his son.</p>

<p>The man's family are still not allowed to see him as hospital are restricted for patients only to curb the spread of coronavirus in Melbourne.  </p>

<p>Eyewitnesses Jake Edwards and his partner George Michael were driving down Cooper St when they stopped and filmed the shocking incident. </p>

<p>Mr Edwards described what they pair witnessed as 'unjustifiable' and 'disgusting' behaviour from Victoria Police. </p>

<p>Witnesses George Michael (left) and Jake Edwards (right) filmed the incident and posted the shocking video to social media</p>

<p>'We've seen a police car ram into (the man) sending him flying a few metres across the road,' Mr Edwards recalled to Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'He got up and the foot chase continued. They run up to the median strip (and) the man did throw a punch or two. </p>

<p>'Then pepper spray was used, punches from the police were thrown. While they were bringing him down and he wasn't restrained yet there were kicks to the head.</p>

<p>'The worst part of it all is while he was restrained with five to six officers on him, there was a stomp to the head and then a knee to the head. Disgusting.' </p>

<p>Outraged, the pair both posted their footage to Facebook where it was broadcast on last night's news. </p>

<p>A mentally unwell roof plumber living with bipolar disorder has been placed into a coma after video showed him being kicked in the head during a brutal arrest</p>

<p>Eventually the man's shocked wife contacted them on social media, trying to find out details of what had happened. </p>

<p>In their video, one of the witnesses can be heard crying out: 'Are you f*****g kidding me?' </p>

<p>A motorist yells at the police to stop kicking the man before the other witness urges him to be quiet. </p>

<p>Victoria Police said the incident unfolded after officers were called over reports of a male behaving erratically about 4.10pm. </p>

<p>'Upon arrival the male allegedly became aggressive and damaged a police vehicle whilst attempting to avoid arrest,' a police spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>

<p>'During the highly dynamic incident a police officer was assaulted and OC spray was deployed before the man was arrested and subsequently taken to hospital for assessment.'</p>

<p>The arrest has been referred to Professional Standards Command.  </p>
