<p>David and Georgia have five children; Ty, 18, Olive, nine, Wilfred, Doris and Birdie, 11 months. </p>

<p>Georgia confirmed the arrival of her fifth child last year with a hilarious Instagram post, as she compared the birth to that of David's Good Omens co-star Michael Sheen's daughter Lyra. </p>

<p>He said: 'Hi mum, I love you mummy. Hi dad, Wilfred, Olive, Doris, Birdie… I love you all. Sorry, I've always wanted to do that,' which led Lorraine to agree that he 'had all the family covered.'</p>

<p>During the interview, Ty also spoke of the moment he met his adopted dad on the set of Doctor Who when he was just five years old. </p>

<p>The budding actor spoke of his close bond with the sci-fi superstar whom he calls his father, and why he would love to be the third Doctor in the family. </p>

<p>David met Ty's mum when she had a guest role in the 2008 episode The Doctor's Daughter - and it was then when Ty met his TV hero.</p>

<p>'It was great, I was five when I first met my dad, my mum was working on Doctor Who at the time,' Ty said.</p>

<p>'I watched him on TV as the hero, and it was crazy how much your life can change.'</p>
