<p>Appearing on Loose Women, the EastEnders star reflected on her journey to motherhood after welcoming daughter Dusty in July with Matt.  </p>

<p>Lacey revealed: 'It took us ages to get pregnant. I put so much pressure on myself to fall pregnant and it wasn't happening.  </p>

<p>The actress tragically suffered from two miscarriages and had begun to give up hope. </p>

<p>She refused to acknowledge her third pregnancy until she was 14 weeks along, and even then she would not allow herself to get excited until she reached the 25 week mark. </p>

<p>She added: 'It got to the point where I said to Matt, "Let's just forget it. We'll get a puppy." As soon as we'd said that, we fell pregnant.' </p>

<p>Prepared: She wore a patterned silk scrunchie on her hand </p>

<p>Proud parents: The couple welcomed their daughter in July last year </p>

<p>Revealing she had a scan 'every week' during her pregnancy with Dusty, she explained: 'I was so scared. Until you feel kicking, you don't know if anything is actually there.</p>

<p>'I always thought, "This might not work," I just became really laid back about the whole thing. I just felt numb to the whole thing.' </p>

<p>She had to change her way of thinking following the devastating disappointment of her first miscarriage as she recalled: 'You start thinking about baby names and looking at clothes and things, and then it was just sort of gone… at seven weeks.  </p>

<p>'It was such a massive shock as quite naively I thought, "I'm going to have a baby"... It's so hard, what do you say to people?</p>

<p>'I don't want them to feel uncomfortable about it. Although I felt so heartbroken, I just thought "I'll brush that under the rug"…</p>

<p>'It's hard because, are you supposed to grieve for something that's the size of a grain of rice? People believe different things, but for me it was a baby from the minute it was conceived.'</p>

<p>Off they go: Lacey was prepared for the outing as she carried a shopping tote bag</p>
