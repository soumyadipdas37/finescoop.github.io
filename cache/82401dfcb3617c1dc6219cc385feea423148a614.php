<p>Pressure is mounting on ministers to intervene in the £30billion sale of Britain's largest tech company Arm.</p>

<p>Daniel Zeichner, the Labour MP for Cambridge, where Arm is based, urged them to step in before the firm is 'thrown away' to US rival Nvidia. </p>

<p>He said it was important to protect the 3,000 skilled jobs at Arm, and said it must be exempted from US rules on where products can be exported to.</p>

<p>Zeichner said: '[Ministers] cannot simply nod this through and hand over decision-making power to a foreign state. </p>

<p>'It is bad for our economy, bad for national security, as well as being incomprehensible tactically ahead of trying to strike a trade deal. It's weak, feeble and foolish.'</p>

<p>The Government is to review whether there are grounds to intervene as critics called for the deal to be referred to the competition watchdog.</p>
