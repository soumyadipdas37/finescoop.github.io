<p>Other than pumpkin spice lattes, there's nothing more 'fall' than a crisp new pair of jeans to style with a chunky knit sweater. </p>

<p>As businesses across the country start to re-open following the COVID-19 shutdown, it's officially time to shop denim.  </p>

<p>Not sure you're ready to squeeze into a pair of skin-tight bottoms after months of leggings, pajama pants and sweats?</p>

<p>Good news! Shopbop's Fashion Director Caroline Maguire reveals the season's top denim trends, and they are not only chic but comfortable!    </p>

<p>According to Caroline, the top denim silhouettes this season are high-rise, wide leg and tapered.  Statement making styles, Bermuda shorts and jumpsuits are also all the rage. </p>

<p>Unlike mid-rise silhouettes that rest below your belly button and cut you in half, high-rise denim with a little bit of stretch works with the body .</p>

<p>'The leg lengthening and waist defining jeans make for a sleek, versatile, and flattering look,' said the expert. </p>

<p>'I style mine with a simple bodysuit and a statement blazer for a powerhouse outfit.'</p>

<p>Sure, they go with everything but not all jeans needs to be basic.  </p>

<p>'We are thrilled to see statement denim back for the season,' declared Caroline.</p>

<p>'Think topsy-turvy tailoring, eclectic and exciting washes, and enhanced designed details.' </p>

<p>Wide leg: Plein Lasso Jeans by B Sides, $385; shopbop.com</p>

<p>Jeans have been around since the 1800s and they've undergone a lot of changes. In the 1970s they peaked saturation in the form of a jumpsuit. </p>

<p>Seventies-inspired styles are a huge inspiration this fall, with roomy denim jumpsuits reigning supreme.</p>

<p>'They are really a no-brainer outfit, requiring minimal effort and delivering a major cool factor,' said Caroline.</p>

<p>'You can expect to see this trend evolve over the coming months with different fabrications, silhouettes and unique details,' she added.</p>

<p>Gained the Quarantine 15? No problem! The big and baggy denim styles of the '90s are back! </p>

<p>'The minimalistic design of a loose fitting wide leg jean allows for a relaxed, comfortable and polished look.'   </p>

<p>For those that like a slimmer silhouette, Caroline revealed that tapered denim is also hot right now. </p>

<p>'It is roomier at the hip and narrow through the ankle, creating a flattering shape. It’s the perfect style to pair with combat boots for a practical, yet chic look.'</p>

<p>Tapered denim: Brodie jeans by Ulla Johnson, $425; shopbop.com</p>

<p>'It is roomier at the hip and narrow through the ankle, creating a flattering shape. It’s the perfect style to pair with combat boots for a practical, yet chic look'</p>

<p>Our wardrobes have become seasonless. By choosing versatile pieces, you can style them in a way that's suitable for the temperature - shorts included!  </p>

<p>'I am currently obsessing over the longer Bermuda-style denim cutoff short for a perfectly casual end-of-summer look.</p>

<p>'I like to pair them with a vibrant tie dye top, oversized sunnies, and a comfortable sport sandal.'</p>

<p>While almost every '90s trend has resurfaced in the last couple of years, low-rise jeans are nowhere in sight.</p>

<p>According to Caroline, high-waisted styles are dominating the fashion landscape.</p>

<p>'We are seeing brands reinvent this timeless trend through updated silhouettes – from pegged styles to distressed hems or even intricate crisscrossed hardware. </p>

<p>'I’ll style a cinched high-waisted jean with a narrow belt and graphic tee for a simple yet elevated look. </p>

<p>'Heading into colder weather, I love pairing high-waisted denim with a novelty cropped sweater – it’s cozy and practical.' </p>

<p>'For a more exaggerated or evening look, I’ll style a high-waisted pegged jean with a balloon sleeve puff shoulder and a bold bag to complete the outfit.'</p>

<p>While Levis and Jordache will always be classic, Isabel Marant, MOUSSY and Nili Lotan, are the ones to watch.</p>

<p>'These designers continue to push the envelope with their updated interpretations of denim staples,' revealed Caroline.</p>

<p>'From harem-peg style silhouettes to tapered bottoms and new prints and washes, these designers are continuously rethinking and pushing the entire denim space forward.' </p>
