<p>The longtime lovebirds have been engaged for seven years, and together for a total of nine.  </p>

<p>The 44-year-old actor recently revealed he took his time when it came to their first kiss, because he thought he wouldn't be kissing anyone else ever again. </p>

<p>Last month, Sudeikis was asked by All Access' Sibley Scoles if it was 'fact or fiction' that he waited 'one month to text Olivia for a date, and on the fourth date there was no kiss.' </p>
