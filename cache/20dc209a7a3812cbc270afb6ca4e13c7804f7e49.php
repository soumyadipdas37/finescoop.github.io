<p>She said she wrote that lyric, 'Because, that’s why everybody always says to me, that no matter what, I was going to be in that shadow.'</p>

<p>'I always believed that, and that's so hard for me to overcome, you know, and that was something I heard my whole life, every single day, my whole life,' she added.</p>

<p>'It was either that or that I wasn’t enough in some way, whether it was the way I look or the way I am. Like I said the other day, sometimes I feel like I don’t even breathe right sometimes,' Noah explained. </p>

<p>'Basically, that is what the song is about, and I just wanted to open up about that once and for all, because that’s been a big part of my life, and I probably won’t talk about it anymore. I just wanted to put it out,” Noah continued.</p>

<p>'Everybody always says you’re giving the people power by seeing it, but I can’t control seeing it,' she added, while starting to tear up a bit.</p>

<p>'You guys are young, you know the internet. It’s been really tough on me, so that song is just pretty tough to get through,' she concluded. </p>
