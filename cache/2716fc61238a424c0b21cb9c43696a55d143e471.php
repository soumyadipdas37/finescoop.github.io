<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump attacked Joe Biden as 'low energy' and complained his rival was 'back in his basement' after the Democratic nominee made a highly-visible campaign stop in Pittsburgh on Monday and will give an education speech on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Trump also claimed Biden is on some kind unspecified 'enhancement' drug during an interview with Fox News that aired on Tuesday. But he did not offer any proof and was not pressed on his claim.</p>

<p>The president lashed out at his rival after a new round of polls showed Biden in the lead after the Republican National Convention, despite the expectation Trump would get a boost after his nomination for a second term. </p>

<p>President Trump claimed Joe Biden is on some kind unspecified 'enhancement' drug during an interview with Fox News  but he did not offer any proof and was not pressed on his claim</p>

<p>'Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individual, especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule!,' Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Biden is receiving an education briefing in Wilmington on Wednesday and then will give a speech on school reopenings and the coronavirus pandemic.  On Monday, he gave a speech in Pittsburgh where he attacked Trump's response to racial unrest and delivered pizza to local firefighters. </p>

<p>After Trump's tweets Wednesday morning, the Biden campaign announced Joe and Jill Biden would go to Wisconsin on Thursday to hold a community meeting in Kenosha. </p>

<p>Trump also touted his own trip to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and continued to push himself as the 'law and order' president as he laid on the attacks.</p>

<p>'Joe Biden is not on the side of Law Enforcement, and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to Kenosha. We solved the problem quickly, and it was very much appreciated by the people of Wisconsin. Joe Biden wouldn’t know where to begin - a bad record!,' he added.</p>

<p>The president has thrown out several attack lines on Biden, questioning his health, his mental abilities and his policies, including distorting Biden's record to claim he would defund the police - which Biden has said he would not. He has accused Biden of 'hiding' in his basement while the Biden campaign said the candidate is simply following coronavirus guidelines. </p>

<p>Trump told Fox News he wanted Biden to take a drug test before their first presidential debate because he claims the Democratic presidential nominee is on 'some kind of enhancement.'</p>

<p>He did not specify and offered no proof. </p>

<p>'He's on some kind of an enhancement, in my opinion,' he said. ' I want to take one. I’ll take one, he’ll take one. We should both take a drug test.' </p>

<p>Biden, meanwhile, will attempt to turn the conversation back to the coronavirus, tying it to the start of the school year in a speech in Wilmington on Wednesday. It's his second speech in three days.</p>

<p>He and Jill Biden will receive a briefing from education experts ahead of his remarks. </p>

<p>'Too many classrooms are empty because of President Trump's continued and willful failure to offer a meaningful plan to address covid-19,' Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders said Tuesday night. 'He's barreling forward trying to reopen schools because he thinks it will help his own reelection. It's very clear, glaringly clear, that Donald Trump doesn't have a plan.' </p>

<p>Jill Biden, a teacher who said she plans to continue her classroom work should she become first lady, is also leading a 'Back-to-School Tour' of 10 cities in eight battleground states this week - some events will be virtual and some will be in person with social distancing measures in place.</p>

<p>President Trump has pushed schools to reopen despite the pandemic, which has infected more than 6.9 million people in the United States and killed more than 185,000 people</p>

<p>Many school districts, however, have opted to begin the school year with virtual learning instead.</p>

<p>The president will be in North Carolina on Wednesday to designate the city of Wilmington as the first American World War II Heritage City. He'll make his remarks from the Battleship North Carolina. </p>

<p>Voters consistently give President Trump low marks for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and race relations in the country. But they give him strong points on his handling of the economy.</p>

<p>The Biden campaign has been stressing how Trump's COVID response has affected the everyday lives of Americans. </p>

<p>But Biden has also been under pressure to respond to Trump's rhetoric on the race demonstrations that have sprung up over the country.</p>

<p>Trump calls himself the 'law and order' president and has blasted protesters.He  was in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Tuesday to survey the damage from protests and riots there after white police shot Jacob Blake, a black man, seven times in front of his children.</p>

<p>'These are not peaceful protests but domestic terror,' he said during his visit.</p>

<p>Biden, meanwhile, blasted the president in a speech in Pittsburgh on Monday. </p>

<p>Biden went after Trump calling him a 'toxic presence' and accused him of 'stoking violence in our cities' asking voters, 'Do you really feel safer under Trump?'  Biden also condemned riots and looting and called on Americans to 'stand against violence - in every form it takes.'  </p>
