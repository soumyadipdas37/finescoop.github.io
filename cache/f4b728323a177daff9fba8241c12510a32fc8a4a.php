<p>PSG have opened talks with Arsenal over a £30m move for Spanish right back Hector Bellerin</p>

<p>Arsenal don't wish to lose him but a sale could free up funds for manager Mikel Arteta to spend</p>

<p>Bellerin is under contract until 2023 but is open to a new challenge.</p>

<p>PSG have been long term admirers and persistent in their pursuit. They have proposed £25m with a further £5m in add ons.</p>

<p>Arsenal value him higher than that and talks will continue. Meanwhile, Arsenal confirmed the £22.6million signing of Gabriel Magalhaes from Lille on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The 22-year old Brazilian will wear the number six shirt and manager Mikel Arteta said: 'He has many qualities which will make us stronger as a defensive unit and as a team.</p>

<p>Juventus and Bayern Munich are also among Bellerin's admirers but PSG made the first move</p>

<p>'He has proved with Lille that he is a defender with many outstanding attributes and we are looking forward to watching him grow as an Arsenal player.'</p>

<p>Arteta, has spent £41m in fees already with Magalhaes' price due to rise to £27m eventually.</p>

<p>They have already signed Pablo Mari from Flamengo, made Cedric Soares's move from Southampton permanent and brought in Willian from Chelsea on a substantial contract. They now need to begin offloading players to help balance the books. </p>
