<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The identity of a frail, elderly woman found by the side of the road on Queensland's Sunshine Coast remains a mystery - and an advocacy group is outraged that she still remains in hospital with no home to go to.</p>

<p>The woman, believed to be in her 80s or 90s, was picked up by a driver on Brandenburg Road in Mooloolah Valley on September 8 and dropped outside Nambour Hospital.</p>

<p>Geoff Rowe, CEO of Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia, told Daily Mail Australia the situation is 'very difficult to comprehend'.</p>

<p>He said it seemed as though the woman had become lost in the system as no-one had come forward to say they recognise her.</p>

<p>The identity of a frail, elderly woman (pictured) found by the side of the road on Queensland's Sunshine Coast remains a mystery</p>

<p>Geoff Rowe (pictured), CEO of Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia, told Daily Mail Australia the situation is 'very difficult to comprehend'</p>

<p>CCTV showed the man who took the woman to the hospital after finding her on the road</p>

<p>'No one in that community has any recognition of her – and it is a small area,' Mr Rowe said.</p>

<p>'The mystery seems deep. If a child had been left and no one claimed, the community would be outraged. </p>

<p>'It is ageism rife and well. We don't seem to care no one has claimed her.'</p>

<p>He said while he believes staff at the hospital have treated the woman well, there had been no progress into finding her a home or a guardian.</p>

<p>A guardian would allow police to take DNA from the woman, as well as make decisions about where the woman should be. </p>

<p>He said Aged and Disability Advocacy Australia would make their services - which includes a legal clinic - available to the woman.</p>

<p>Last week police made another plea to the public to come forward if they recognised the woman.</p>

<p>Police Inspector Matt Robertson says the woman was in a vulnerable situation and 'very frail', requiring medical treatment.</p>

<p>The man who found the woman took her to hospital and told staff he didn't know her and had no reason to think he was doing anything except helping her.  </p>

<p>'He came in, he stated exactly what occurred and at this stage the evidence suggests what he said occurred,' Inspector Robertson said, according to the ABC.</p>

<p>'He does believe he might have seen her in the area before.'  </p>

<p>While police were eager to find out more about the case, they were not investigating any criminality or elderly abuse, and just want to find her family.</p>

<p>Police have released an image of her ring in the hopes it might help someone identity her. </p>

<p>'Our primary investigation is just to locate who this lady is to reunite her with her family,' Inspector Robertson.</p>

<p>Police have been unable to ask the woman who she is because she has been suffering a 'challenging health situation', although she is improving after being transferred to Sunshine Coast University Hospital.</p>

<p>Inspector Robertson said she was now able to communicate verbally and have conversations with people.</p>

<p>Police have released an image of her ring in the hopes it might help someone identity her</p>

<p>'It's not something where we've been able to go charging in very quickly with and we're taking it one step at a time and exploring those avenues as she's capable,' he said.</p>

<p>Police are unable to DNA test people without their permission, so they're hoping someone can identify the woman.</p>

<p>'That's going to be our quickest line of inquiry without bureaucracy, sending off inquiries that could take days to get back,' Inspector Robertson said.</p>

<p>'It only takes one person, who knows a person, to make one phone call and we can identify the lady.'</p>

<p>He said the woman's situation was unique, agreeing that it was almost like a reverse missing person's case.</p>

<p>'We have the located person, we're just trying to find the family,' he said.</p>
