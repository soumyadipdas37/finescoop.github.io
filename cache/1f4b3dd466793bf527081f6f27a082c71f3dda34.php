<p>In the same interview, Hayley revealed that she, too, hopes to carry a baby, shortly after Fiona gives birth. </p>

<p>Hayley said: 'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best.'</p>

<p>Fiona and Hayley became engaged during a romantic trip to Vanuatu last April.</p>
