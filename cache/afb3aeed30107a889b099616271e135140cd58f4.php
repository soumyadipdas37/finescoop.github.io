<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An overcrowded pool party 'like Mardi Gras' where about 200 guests gathered, failed to wear masks and ignored social distancing was shut down near the University of South Carolina on Saturday.</p>

<p>Columbia Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins said he drove by the pool at The Apartments at Palmetto Compress in Columbia following a complaint to the city about people violating the city’s mask ordinance.</p>

<p>He arrived just before 6pm and found hundreds of students partying, drinking and swimming close to one another and the crowd appeared to be over capacity.</p>

<p>'It was almost like Mardi Gras. I saw a large crowd in the pool, in the area on the side of the pool, and top of the pool house,' Chief Jenkins said to The State.</p>

<p>The Columbia Fire Department shut down a party where 200 people were gathered at the pool at The Apartments at Palmetto Compress in Columbia near the University of South Carolina campus on Saturday</p>

<p>People were seen drinking, not wearing masks and ignoring social distancing. The apartment complex houses many University of South Carolina students</p>

<p>'It was almost like Mardi Gras... Nobody was practicing social distancing. Nobody was wearing a mask. But there was lots of drinking going on,' Fire Chief Aubrey Jenkins said</p>

<p>The apartment is home to many University of South Carolina students and is near the campus that’s already struggling with an outbreak of COVID-19 among students since starting fall semester on August 20.</p>

<p>As of Thursday 620 people tested positive for the virus and 553 cases remain active on campus, according to USC. Outbreaks occurred in six sorority houses in the University’s Greek village, forcing students to quarantine after people tested positive for the virus in each house. </p>

<p>Jenkins spoke with a security guard and a manager at the Palmetto Compress apartments and they decided to shut down the pool until next week. Jenkins said he’d recommend keeping the pool shut for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>The Columbia Fire Marshal is expected to do a capacity check at the apartments on Monday.</p>

<p>'If nothing was going on (like the COVID-19 pandemic), there still would have been too many people in the pool. Nobody was practicing social distancing. Nobody was wearing a mask. But there was lots of drinking going on,' Jenkins said.</p>

<p>The apartment is home to many University of South Carolina students. The pool has been shut down for this week and could be for the foreseeable future</p>

<p>Chief Jenkins said he was disturbed when he spoke with a young man at the party who claimed 'I can’t catch COVID. I’m immune to the stuff.'</p>

<p>'That was just a perfect storm to spread the virus. If someone in the crowd had it, it was just a perfect storm,' Jenkins said to WLTX.</p>

<p>No tickets were handed out on Saturday, but party goers were given a warning.</p>

<p>Anyone found to be in violation in the city of Columbia’s mask ordinance will be fined $25 and businesses $100.</p>

<p>But Jenkins says the apartment’s management will be punished if there are more issues.</p>

<p>As of Thursday 620 students tested positive for the virus and 553 cases remain active, according to USC. A view of the University of South Carolina campus above</p>

<p>This chart by the university shows how cases of COVID-19 have risen since reopening campus and starting fall semester on August 20</p>

<p>According to the university since August 1 there have been 639 positive COVID results</p>

<p>'I know it can be inconvenient. It can be aggravating sometimes. But we’ve got to make sure we’re doing the right thing. We’ve got to make sure we’re keeping one another safe,' Jenkins said.</p>

<p>The University of South Carolina released a statement reminding students of their responsibility to the community.</p>

<p>'We’re grateful for the partnership we have with City of Columbia and fully support their decision to take actions to protect public safety. We have engaged with private apartment complexes for months to educate them on safe public health standards. Unfortunately, some have chosen not to manage their properties appropriately to protect the community. We also urge our students to remember their responsibilities and please use good judgement, avoiding situations where safe social distancing isn’t possible.'</p>

<p>On Wednesday 191 new cases of the virus were confirmed on campus.</p>

<p>'Am I concerned? Yes, I am. Is it acceptable? No. It’s not. I don’t know if you can sustain 191 positives,' USC president Bob Caslen said. </p>
