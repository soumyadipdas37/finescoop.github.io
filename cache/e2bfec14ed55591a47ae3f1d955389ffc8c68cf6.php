<p>Kris Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian are denying sexual harassment claims in a new lawsuit filed by a former bodyguard</p>

<p>Jenner's lawyer, Marty Singer, denied the claims in a statement to TMZ: 'Kris categorically denies ever behaving inappropriately toward Marc McWilliams. The security guard worked outside the house and he never even went into Kris' house.'</p>

<p>McWillliams reportedly worked for the family in 2017 and claimed that Kris 'embarked on a pattern of conduct involving non-consensual physical contact with Plaintiff of an inappropriate and sexual nature.'</p>

<p>He also claimed Kris was 'repeatedly and frequently causing her body to come into intimate physical contact' with his body. </p>

<p>Singer added: 'Kris had very little interaction with him. After the guard was repeatedly caught sleeping in his car while on the job, the security company was asked not to assign him to work there in the future.'</p>

<p>'The guard never made any complaints to his employer about Kris until contriving this ludicrous claim,' Singer noted before adding: 'Although Kourtney is named in the suit, she is not accused of doing anything improper with the guard, nor did she do so.'</p>
