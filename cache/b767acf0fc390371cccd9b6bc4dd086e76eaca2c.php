<p>A veteran New Jersey cop died hours after jumping into a river to save a suspect fleeing from the scene of a burglary.  </p>

<p>Peek, who was a married father-of-one, joined the force 15 years ago. He was found unresponsive late Sunday morning; the cause of death is pending. </p>

<p>Davis made it across the river and was arrested, police said. </p>

<p>Police Chief Michael Gaimari Sr. said Monday: 'Sean made a decision as would any officer and entered to water in [an] attempt to pull the person from the running waters no matter what the circumstances.</p>

<p>'The woman eventually made it across the river but Officer Peek had difficulty making it back to shore as he was still donning all of his equipment and gear.' </p>
