<p>Under the knife: Jess Wright has revealed she secretly underwent a breast reduction earlier this year (left after surgery, right before)</p>

<p>Jess, who documented her boob job on TOWIE in 2011, said: 'I got home from where we got engaged and I went in for an operation. had my breasts made smaller.</p>

<p>'I wanted to share as it's good for girls who are in position who want to get a boob or job or want to get a reduction.' </p>

<p>'I had one about 8 years ago now and I've always felt they were too big. </p>

<p>Surgery: The former TOWIE star, 35, went under the knife shortly after her engagement in March, reducing her cup size from a 32DD to a 32C</p>

<p>'Everything I wore I felt they were sticking out of bikinis I was always falling out of them, and everything I wore on the red carpet I really had to tailor make or make sure [I couldn't fall out of], and I couldn't wear anything that I wanted to because of them.  </p>

<p>After much deliberation, Jess revealed she underwent three consultations around the world, one in LA, before deciding she definitely wanted to do it.</p>

<p>'I always thought you could only have a reduction which is quite a lot more work and you have a different scar, but actually you can change the size of your implant which is exactly what I have done,' she said.</p>

<p>Way back when: During her heyday on the ITVBe show, Jessica showed her journey to surgery including asking her mum Carol, Nanny Pat and brother Mark for advice (pictured 2011)</p>

<p>'I am so pleased with them I feel so much more comfortable in bikinis in front of people, and I feel I can wear so much better can wear better clothing.</p>

<p>'I would absolutely recommend anyone who feels like they've had boobs done that are too big to go back and change them for smaller, or don't get them done in the first place as the fashion these days is for smaller boobs.'</p>

<p>When asked if she regretted getting her implants put in in the first place, Jess said: 'Don't get me wrong, as much I thought they were too big, they weren't ridiculously big, and naked they looked good. Some people got good use… joking.</p>

<p>'They were good for a certain amount of time. I wish I had gone for a smaller implant.</p>

<p>'If you've got good breast muscle there to begin with, don't go too big or they will look absolutely massive.'</p>

<p>Jess previously voiced her desire to have a breast reduction. </p>

<p>In 2016, she told MailOnline: 'The surgeons went too big when I had my boob job and I've been back to two surgeons to get a reduction and they've both said: "You've got great boobs, don't change them" but I just think they're too big.</p>

<p>'I was happy with them at first but I was younger - times have changed and fashion has changed.' </p>

<p>The television personality admits that showing her family the results of her surgery on TV was a big regret: 'One thing I do regret is my boob job being on TOWIE. It probably wasn't the best of moves but at the same time whatever.'</p>
