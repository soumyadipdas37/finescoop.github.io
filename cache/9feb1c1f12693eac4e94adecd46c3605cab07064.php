<p>Maxine and Jake Young were already parents to a biological son named Henry when, in December of 2019, they adopted four siblings that they had been fostering for years.</p>

<p>After the adoption, the couple decided to try for one more child — but were in for a major surprise when Maxine got pregnant with quadruplets, transforming them into a family of 11 in just three years.</p>

<p>Growing family! A Pennsylvania couple are now parents to a total of nine children after welcoming quadruplets — about a year after adopting four siblings</p>

<p>Lots of love: Maxine and Jake Young from Pennsylvania had one biological child and adopted four more</p>

<p>Surprise! Shortly after the adoption was finalized, Maxine became pregnant with quadruplets </p>

<p>Huge: They are now a family of 11, which they say is 'crazy' but they are 'grateful'</p>

<p>According to a GoFundMe page started by Jake's mother, ArLette Young, Jake and Maxine married in May of 2016 they wanted a family right away. </p>

<p>'Maxine always wanted to be a foster parent and had always dreamed of having a large family with adopted and biological children,' ArLette wrote. </p>

<p>'Jake was completely on board and loved the idea of having a house filled with lots of love and laughter, maybe a little bit of chaos too!'</p>

<p>They got a bit more love and chaos than they expected, though.</p>

<p>First, the couple completed foster parent training and took in three siblings on July 28, 2017. At the time, the children were four, two, and 11 months, and they were joined a month later by a fourth sibling, a newborn baby girl.  </p>

<p>'All the while, they were trying for a baby to join their family,' ArLette explained. 'They suffered multiple miscarriages, chemical pregnancies, a round of IVF and an IUI before they finally were blessed with their son, Henry, in October 2018.'</p>

<p>Starting a family: They married in 2016 and began fostering four siblings about a year later</p>

<p>Permanent:  They then had a biological son, and a year later, they finalized the adoption of the four siblings</p>

<p>In the NICU: Now they have four more members in their family</p>

<p>Major shock: Maxine, who used IVF to get pregnant with her first biological child, was surprised to conceive the quads naturally</p>

<p>'I didn’t even think that I could get pregnant without doing IVF or IUI, which we had to do with our son' she said</p>

<p>The babies are here! Maxine gave birth on July 31 at 32 weeks</p>

<p>Siblings: One of their older children meets one of the new babies at the hospital</p>

<p>'It’s been crazy, but I don’t think it’s hit us just yet,' Jake said</p>

<p>Just a year after Henry was born, the couple officially adopted the four siblings they were fostering on December 20, 2019.</p>

<p>'It was chaos,' Maxine told local news station WFMZ. 'We went from zero to five within less than a year.'</p>

<p>The couple thought their family of seven was complete, but within weeks of finalizing the adoption, Maxine found out she was pregnant again — this time, without even having to use IVF.  </p>

<p>'I didn’t even think that I could get pregnant without doing IVF or IUI, which we had to do with our son. I remember texting [my husband] and was like, "Oh my God,"' Maxine said. </p>

<p>And they soon learned that they weren't expecting just one more baby but four, since Maxine had unexpectedly become pregnant with quadruplets.  </p>

<p>Gaining strength: The babies all spent at least a month in the NICU, and two are still there</p>

<p>Healthy: They were born between 8 a.m. and 8:02 a.m., each weighting between three and four pounds</p>

<p>Names: The couple named them Silas Ledger, Theo Alexander, Beck Killian, and Cecilia Hudson</p>

<p>'Luckily, they’re all doing really well, and we’re really grateful,' Maxine added</p>

<p>Home! Two of the babies have been able to go home this week</p>
