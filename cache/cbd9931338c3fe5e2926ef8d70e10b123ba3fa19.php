<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Germany defender Christoph Metzelder has made a confession in the investigation over child pornography allegations, a report in his native country has claimed.</p>

<p>The bombshell revelation emerged after Metzelder took action against a press release issued by the Dusseldorf District Court, which had outlined the prosecution's indictment against the ex-footballer. </p>

<p>Investigators have accused the 39-year-old of having possessed 297 files of child pornographic content, and he is also said to have sent 29 images and videos of a similar nature via WhatsApp to three women last year. </p>

<p>Christoph Metzelder has been accused of possessing and distributing child pornography</p>

<p>Der Spiegel claim that it is unknown to what extent Metzelder has made a confession over the claims against him. </p>

<p>Neither the public prosecutor, nor the local court, outlined whether a full or partial admission was made at the request of the publication.</p>

<p>Metzelder wanted to prevent the District Court from revealing to the press, either via a press release or verbally, any information about the proceedings. </p>

<p>Police questioned Metzelder last year as part of the investigation and confiscated his phone</p>

<p>He will be able to file a complaint against the decision with the Higher Administrative Court. </p>

<p>Police had questioned Metzelder last year as part of the investigation and confiscated computer equipment during two raids of his Dusseldorf home. </p>

<p>The former defender stepped down as president of club TuS Haltern after being interrogated, and was taking part in a coaching course at a sports school in the Rhine when officers arrived to confiscate his phone.  </p>

<p>Metzelder made 47 appearances for Germany during his career and also won the Bundesliga</p>

<p>'The accused is alleged to have sent to a (female) recipient in Hamburg pictures with child pornographic content through the communication platform WhatsApp,' the Hamburg state prosecutor's office had said. </p>

<p>Metzelder won the Bundesliga with Borussia Dortmund, and also played for Schalke and Real Madrid during his career.</p>

<p>He was a World Cup runner-up in 2002, having won 47 caps for his country, and also featured in the same tournament four years later.</p>
