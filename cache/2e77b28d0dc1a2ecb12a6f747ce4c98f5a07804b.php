<p>Excited Hayley Sexton, 33, had chosen the name Isabella, painted the nursery pink, and bought two Moses baskets, blankets and baby grows in the same colour after being told at two scans that she was expecting a little girl.</p>

<p>But the single mother, from Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, was left completely speechless when she was told her newborn was in fact a boy seconds after she gave birth.</p>

<p>Little Alfie Sexton arrived at 16:39pm, weighing a healthy 6lbs 6oz after a 33 hour labour at University Hospital of North Tees, on September 20 - and Hayley has since re-decorated the nursery and taken back all the pink clothing she purchased. </p>

<p>Hayley suggested the reason medics told her she was expecting a girl is because Alfie was showing up 'very small' on the scan. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, Hayley even had a pink-themed baby shower and received piles of pretty pastel coloured clothing and personalised presents including an engraved 'Isabella' ornament.</p>

<p>Teaching assistant Hayley said: 'I moved house before I started the nursery so I went all out, I got pink everything and I had "Isabella" written all over the walls.</p>

<p>'I was over the moon when I found out I was going to have a little girl. I thought I'm going to have a little best friend for the rest of my life.'</p>

<p>Recalling the moment she discovered she was actually birthing a little boy, Hayley explained: 'When the midwife said "he's here" I was like "what do you mean 'he'?"</p>

<p>Recalling the moment she discovered she was actually birthing a little boy, Hayley (pictured at her baby shower) explained: 'When the midwife said "he's here" I was like "what do you mean 'he'?"</p>

<p>'It was a huge shock - I had no idea I was having a boy. At two scans I'd been told my baby was a girl. I absolutely love him, but it meant we had to do lots of sorting when we took him home.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'The whole nursery had to be re-decorated, we had to come up with a new name and had to take back a load of pink clothes we'd bought - but I wouldn't change Alfie for the world.</p>

<p>'It was the craziest experience of my life. I didn't realise at first. It was only when the midwife gave him a clean off and lifted him up that I saw his bits!</p>

<p>When Hayley (pictured at her baby shower) called her family to let them know, they were shocked: 'I was in shock, all my family were. I called my mum to tell her and she didn't believe me'</p>

<p>Hayley was also gifted personalised presents including an engraved 'Isabella' ornament (pictured above)</p>

<p>'It was so strange because when I was pregnant I was having dreams that I had given birth to a baby boy. My dad joked saying what you would do if you had a boy, and it happened.'</p>

<p>'Some of them were upset for a bit because it was like they were grieving for a child they were expecting for so long. But I love Alfie to bits - he's such a lovely little boy. It was meant to be.'</p>
