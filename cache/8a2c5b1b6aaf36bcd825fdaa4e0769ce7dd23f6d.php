<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin today branded the Rule of Six as 'byzantine' and 'complicated' as he likened the government's chaotic ever-changing restrictions to a 'speedboat in a competition'.</p>

<p>The pub chain's chief executive, 65, said the UK's policies needed to be more like an ocean liner, with only tiny alterations to their course during the pandemic.</p>

<p>He spoke after there had been 66 workers across 50 of the firm's pubs who had tested positive for coronavirus.  </p>

<p>Mr Martin, worth an estimated £322million, said: 'I think one of the problems is that the rules have become byzantine and complicated.</p>

<p>‘I think that the UK and the coronavirus problem needs to be like the Queen Mary crossing the Atlantic – just the odd touch at the tiller.</p>

<p>‘What we are getting is different rules all the time, it’s like a speedboat in a competition. We are changing all the time and I don’t think anyone really understands the rules anymore.’ </p>

<p>He added to Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘I think it’s a slightly chaotic rule myself – apologies to the government, but it just doesn’t seem to me to make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>'94 per cent of our pubs have had no coronavirus cases whatsoever and only one per cent has had more than one case.'</p>

<p>He added the assumption that pubs were the centre of transmissions was wrong and they were safe. </p>

<p>Two pubs had up to four employees infected and six have confirmed two while the remaining 40 have reported just one worker testing positive for Covid-19.   </p>

<p>JD Wetherspoon, which employs 43,000 people across its 861 pubs said that the vast majority of its establishments have recorded no positive cases. </p>

<p>The company hasn't revealed which pubs have been affected.   </p>

<p>Last month, three staff at the North and South Wales Bank in Wrexham, North Wales, tested positive but it remained open. </p>

<p>Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin (pictured) recently shot down claims made by a disease expert that pubs are 'dangerous places to be' during the pandemic</p>

<p>The firm said most of the reported cases have been mild or asymptomatic and 28 of the 66 employees have already returned to work, after self-isolating in accordance with medical guidelines. </p>

<p>It follows a rise in new coronavirus cases, with a further 3,330 positive cases recorded in the UK on Sunday. </p>

<p>A whopping 32million Brits have crammed into Wetherspoons pubs since they reopened on July 4. </p>

<p>Pubs don't have to close after finding a positive test result unless they are made to do so by local health protection officials.   </p>

<p>Mr Martin recently shot down claims made by a disease expert that pubs are 'dangerous places to be' during the pandemic. </p>

<p>He blasted: 'The situation with regard to pubs has been widely misunderstood.</p>

<p>'It is clearly not the case that pubs are ''dangerous places to be''.'  </p>

<p>Mr Martin also claims the chain has invested £15million into safeguarding its pubs and implementing measures such as screens between tables and reducing capacity.  </p>

<p>It comes as the pub giant revealed that trading was 'very quiet' over the weekend, before the Government's tightened restrictions on social gatherings came into action this morning. </p>

<p>Mr Martin shrugged off claims that larger groups might rush to the pub before the implementation of the new 'rule of six'.</p>

<p>Mr Martin also claims the chain has invested £15million into safeguarding its pubs and implementing measures such as screens between tables and reducing capacity</p>

<p>The new rule means people could face fines of up to £3,200 if they are involved in social gatherings of more than six people.</p>

<p>Mr Martin said: 'Trade was very quiet over the weekend, as the public weighed up the evidence about the alleged dangers of going out - Wetherspoon sales were 22.5 per cent below the equivalent Saturday last year.'</p>

<p>Trade groups, including the British Beer &amp; Pub Association, said the new rule will halt the recovery of hospitality firms without extended financial support for the sector.</p>

<p>Mr Martin told investors on Monday that he believes the safety of pubs during the pandemic has been 'widely misunderstood'. </p>

<p>Wetherspoon pubs have made many changes to their normal service and way of running things</p>

<p>Last month, the group said like-for-like bar and food sales were down 16.9 per cent for the 44 days to August 16, compared with the same period last year.</p>

<p>Mr Martin said the sales slump means it expects to post a loss for the year to July 26. </p>

<p>The news comes as the 'rule of six' law came into force today - with public gatherings now limited to just six people indoors and out.</p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel today warned Brits will get criminal records if they break the rules. </p>

<p>Home Office officials have said that anyone who refuses to pay the initial £100 on-the-spot fine will be arrested and taken to court.</p>

<p>Pubs, bars and restaurants must also take the details of punters or risk £1,000 fines.</p>
