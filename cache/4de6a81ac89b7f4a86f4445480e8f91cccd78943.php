<p>Ailing golden retriever, Tao, 11, sadly lost his eyesight to glaucoma last year which prompted his owner to find him a furry friend.</p>

<p>Oko was introduced to Tao when he was just eight-weeks-old and they have formed 'the sweetest bond'. </p>

<p>A video shows the inseparable duo from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, walking together and the pair also enjoy playing a game of tug of war.  </p>

<p>An adorable 16-week-old puppy in Somerset called Oko (pictured right) has taken on the role of 'guide dog' for his blind golden retriever buddy, Tao, 11 (left)</p>

<p>'Guide dog' Oko, who is now 16 weeks old, is the perfect companion for Tao who needs guiding on walks. </p>

<p>Owner Melanie Jackson said: 'Tao was diagnosed with glaucoma which is when the eye has an irregular drainage angle and cannot drain away the fluid.</p>

<p>'It all happened so fast as he was fine in the morning but on the evening he was shaking his head which suggested he is in pain.</p>

<p>'Five hours later, he was blind and his eye was removed!</p>

<p>Tao, 11, sadly lost his eyesight to glaucoma last year and had his second eye removed in January this year, leaving him completely blind</p>

<p>Owner Melanie Jackson from Shepton Mallet, Somerset said 'guide dog' puppy Oko is the perfect companion for Tao who needs guiding on walks</p>

<p>'We were told his second eye will need removing to but we were able to control the pressure for a few weeks by applying eye drops.'</p>

<p>Tao was taught new commands for when he would be totally blind and his second eye was removed in January this year.</p>

<p>Despite being happy and able to walk off the lead, Melanie says something was still missing.</p>

<p>The pair were introduced when Oko just eight-weeks-old and they have formed 'the sweetest bond'</p>

<p>They have become the best of friends and enjoy going on walks and playing tug of war together </p>

<p>'We were pleasantly surprised when Tao began walking up and down the stairs just three days after his operation,' she said.</p>

<p>'But I just felt like he needed a buddy to help him and play with him now that he can no longer see.</p>

<p>'We got Oko at eight-weeks-old and they have formed the sweetest bond.</p>

<p>'Tao follows him around the fields and they sleep with each other.</p>

<p>'We are in the process of training Tao to follow Oko so he doesn't get in the way of any danger.'</p>
