<p>That's your lot for today - join us again tomorrow for all the latest transfer news! </p>

<p>Watford have moved for Murray to bolster their bid for an immediate return to the Premier League following their relegation to the Championship.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old is set to become Watford’s second summer addition following the free transfer capture of right back Jeremy Ngakia after he left West Ham.</p>

<p>The Bavarian giants originally moved for Perisic, spending £4.6m on his loan deal, after failing to seal transfers for top targets Callum Hudson-Odoi and Leroy Sane last summer.</p>

<p>The European champions now want to sign the 31-year-old permanently this summer but the Italian giants are likely to reject their offer, as it is believed they are demanding at least £13m for the Croatian international.</p>

<p>The Gunners emerged as frontrunners to land Magalhaes after agreeing a deal to sign him earlier this month - beating off competition from the likes of Napoli, Manchester United and Chelsea.</p>

<p>Last week he was in London to complete his medical, but was forced to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in the UK - yet the move has now been confirmed by the club.</p>

<p>Everton, Leicester City and Aston Villa are among the clubs to have asked about the 22-year-old - while Crystal Palace and Newcastle United are likely to be priced out despite their interest.</p>

<p>Edouard's representatives are due to hold talks over his future with Celtic ready to offer a new contract to convince him to stay for one more season, as they bid for a 10th consecutive league title.</p>

<p>Immobile's fine form has seen links to Liverpool and Barcelona emerge, but the Italian striker is reportedly in no mood to leave Simone Inzaghi's side, and instead is eager to commit his future to the club.</p>

<p>The report states that the new bumper contract would see Immobile rake in around £3million per season with Lazio, which has become a home for the star after spells with Juventus, Torino, Borussia Dortmund and Sevilla.</p>

<p>Ex-Barcelona vice-president Jordi Mestre wants Lionel Messi to make a u-turn on his decision to leave the club as Manchester City eye a sensational move for the star.</p>

<p>The Spanish giants and LaLiga both insist that Messi's £630million release clause remains intact despite his claims, but Mestre hopes the two parties can sort out their differences and avoid a parting of ways this summer.</p>

<p>Sevilla have bought Ivan Rakitic back from Barcelona for an initial fee of just £1.3million - six years after selling him to the Spanish giants for £18m.</p>

<p>The Croatia midfielder was earmarked as one of the players who could leave as part of new manager Ronald Koeman's huge summer overhaul at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Forest are expected to sign Benfica midfielder Tavares on a loan deal which will include an option to buy the 21-year-old.</p>

<p>Tavares made just two appearances in all competitions for the Benfica first-team last season. </p>

<p>The 19-year-old forward, handed his first senior start by boss Carlo Ancelotti in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park in June, has made 11 Premier League appearances.</p>

<p>He made his full debut against Liverpool in Everton's first game back after the season had been suspended, but has yet to score his first senior goal.</p>

<p>The Cottagers are offering around £2m for a loan fee with the option to buy the midfielder for £25m.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old made 18 appearances in all competitions for the Portuguese side last season. </p>

<p>Neymar has put any suggestion that he could leave PSG after their European heartbreak to bed and also told the club's official magazine he would like to go one better in this season's Champions League and become a legend in the French capital.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old was heavily linked with a move back to former club Barcelona before the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Valencia boss Javi Gracia is targeting a move for the France U21 international having failed to raid former club Watford for Guendouzi's compatriot Etienne Capoue.</p>

<p>The Spanish side are likely to push for a season-long loan deal for Guendouzi amid their worsening financial situation, but there is the potential of a £22million (€25m) purchase clause being included in negotiations.</p>

<p>Wilson, who scored seven Premier League goals in 2019-20, is high on Steve Bruce's wish list after watching his side struggle to hit the back of the net in the last campaign.</p>

<p>Ritchie's possible departure may leave Newcastle fans disappointed though, with the 30-year-old becoming a fan favourite during his time at St James' Park.</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands Bayer Leverkusen are on the verge of agreeing a deal for Roma forward Patrik Schick.</p>

<p>It appears Leverkusen are pressing forward with plans to replace talisman Havertz, as he edges closer to a £90m move to Chelsea.</p>

<p>A number of Premier League sides, including Leeds and Newcastle, have expressed interest in the energetic England U21 international - who impressed on loan at Swansea City last season.</p>

<p>Palace though have been eager to convince Gallagher to join them and have instigated talks with Chelsea and the player's representatives.</p>

<p>The Bundesliga outfit are now interested in signing Martinez, having lost the talented Alexander Nubel to Bayern Munich on a free transfer.</p>

<p>The Argentine was in goal on Saturday for Arsenal's Community Shield victory against Liverpool on penalties at Wembley, but Bernd Leno is still thought to be ahead of the 27-year-old in the pecking order. </p>

<p>The German star has been a free agent since leaving Borussia Dortmund last month and has been linked with a number of clubs - with rumours of a possible move to the MLS or China.</p>

<p>His partner Ann-Kathrin has remained coy on his next destination, but teased that an agreement was already in place with a cryptic response during a Q&amp;A on her Instagram account...</p>

<p>Tottenham face competition from a number of sides in Spain's second tier after the centre midfielder impressed on loan at Cartegena last season.</p>

<p>However, despite reports Jose Mourinho may be able to land the Brazilian for as little as £2m, the La Liga giants are said to want around £3.6m up front, with the same amount in add-ons in order to sanction a deal.</p>

<p>Duffy could be signed and sealed in time to focus fully on his Republic of Ireland international double header with Bulgaria and Finland.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old central defender also had interest from West Ham and West Bromwich Albion.</p>

<p>Roma are now readying an offer for the defender to try to seal his signature before the transfer window closes in October.</p>

<p>Smalling returned to Old Trafford following the conclusion of the 2019-20 domestic season with his loan not extended to play in the delayed Europa League in August.</p>

<p>Real Madrid midfielder Ceballos has already agreed to move back to the Emirates following talks with manager Mikel Arteta.</p>

<p>Ceballos spent last season at Arsenal, making 37 appearances in all competitions, and was keen to return to London after finishing the season strongly for the FA Cup winners.</p>

<p>Newcastle are also reportedly making a push for Wilson, 28, while Crystal Palace are monitoring the situation too.</p>

<p>Wilson is keen to remain in the Premier League, with a view to earning a place in England's squad for next summer's Euros, with Dean Smith's pursuit of Brentford's Ollie Watkins hitting a roadblock. </p>

<p>With Donny van de Beek's arrival at Old Trafford imminent, the future of current United midfielders Jesse Lingard and Andreas Pereira appears to be in some doubt. </p>

<p>United are well covered in the middle of the park with Van de Beek potentially joining Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandes, Fred, Nemanja Matic, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata for places.</p>

<p>The Croatian is reportedly not part of Ronald Koeman's plans at the Camp Nou. </p>

<p>The midfielder has agreed a two-year deal with Sevilla, with an option for a third, and will take a significant pay cut as a result. </p>

<p>The in-demand defender signed a new deal in July which runs until 2023 and includes a release clause of about £38m - but crucially it cannot be triggered until next summer.</p>

<p>Yet United are still exploring a potential deal for the 21-year-old, who last week was named in the senior France squad for the first time. </p>

<p>The finer details of the deal are still to be finalised, but this one looks to be nearing a completion, with the 21-year-old missing fitness tests at Leverkusen over the past few days.</p>

<p>A £90million deal would be Chelsea's biggest outlay so far this summer, in a couple of months where Frank Lampard's squad has undergone a major rebuild. </p>

<p>In case you missed it last night, the Armenian has now joined the Serie A club following his successful loan spell. </p>

<p>Mkhitaryan was rather impressive for Roma last season - he scored nine goals and provided six assists in 27 appearances.</p>

<p>What a move this could turn out to be! Reports indicate that Juventus are eyeing out-of-favour Barcelona striker Luis Suarez this summer, as a replacement for Gonzalo Higuain. </p>

<p>Roma's Edin Dzeko is the Serie A champions' other alternative up front, but it looks like Cristiano Ronaldo could have a new strike partner in ex-Liverpool man Suarez... </p>

<p>The 23-year-old Ajax star is set to sign a five-year deal in the coming days, with a £40m fee agreed between the two clubs. </p>

<p>Van de Beek is in the Holland squad for their Nations League games at home to Poland and Italy, but will link up with the squad later than was initially planned.</p>

<p>The story of the window continues to rumble on, with latest reports stating that City would offer the Barcelona skipper a two-year contract should he move to the Etihad in the coming weeks. </p>

<p>The report adds that City's director of football Txiki Begiristain is already in Barcelona in an attempt to strike a deal for the 33-year-old star. </p>
