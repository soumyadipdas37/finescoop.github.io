<p>Calvin Kitchin left a handwritten note on the footballer's car, branding him a 'rich f<strong><em>ing c</em></strong>' with a sense of entitlement.</p>

<p>The former England star had left the flashy vehicle in the car park of Cal's Own in Jesmond, despite the owner claiming to have never seen Carroll, 31, eat at the diner.</p>

<p>Mr Kitchin said he was unaware the Mercedes belonged to Carroll and only found out after the bemused striker posted the scribbled note on his Instagram with the caption: 'Didn't like your pizza anyway.'</p>

<p>Calvin Kitchin left a handwritten note on the footballer's car, branding him a 'rich f<strong><em>ing c</em></strong>' with a sense of entitlement</p>

<p>The note read: 'Listen you rich f****** c***, you have a nice car I'll give you that. Otherwise I pay £42,000-a-year for my lease.</p>

<p>'If you were to come into my restaurant and ask if you could use my parking to park nicely, me or my staff would probably say yes.</p>

<p>'Otherwise, you are a c***'. 'You don't understand the meaning of money and/or courtesy. You are on a different planet to the working class. </p>

<p>'You do what you want, when you want. 'Hence why you can't just be nice and take what you want.'</p>

<p>Since finding out the identity of the target of his rage, Mr Kitchin has doubled down his anger as it is Carroll, and not him, who 'looks like an idiot'.</p>

<p>The bemused striker (pictured) posted the scribbled note on his Instagram with the caption: 'Didn't like your pizza anyway'</p>

<p>The restaurant has won awards and even counted former Magpies manager Rafa Benitez as a regular customer, according to Mr Kitchin</p>

<p>He said: 'What would be civilised is to come [inside] and ask if he could park his massive car, especially when there is plenty of on-street parking.</p>

<p>'He took up two spaces - what if a disabled customer came? There is a parking meter down the road which barely costs anything anyway.' </p>

<p>Mr Kitchin has courted controversy in the past and in 2018 was forced to apologise after comparing negative TripAdvisor reviewers to 'child molesters'.</p>

<p>And last year a court heard he he was punched inside the Holly Avenue West restaurant by an angry father demanding his son's wages.  </p>

<p>However, despite the controversy, the restaurant has won awards and even counted former Magpies manager Rafa Benitez as a regular customer, according to Mr Kitchin. </p>
