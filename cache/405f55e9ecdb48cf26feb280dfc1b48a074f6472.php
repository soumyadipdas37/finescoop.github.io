<p>The male, who was believed to have been visiting the area from his home in Chelmsford, Essex, was pronounced dead at the scene. </p>

<p>The 42-year-old man fell into the water off the sailing club at Rock beach at around 1.30pm yesterday (pictured today)</p>

<p>He was one of two men who came off their boards while paddleboarding on the Camel Estuary</p>

<p>A local boatman managed to free the entrapped man from the moorings and haul him into his vessel.</p>

<p>But this boatman also encountered problems and was forced to fire a red mayday flare to signal for help.</p>

<p>A major rescue operation was launched involving the Padstow Harbour boat, Rock RNLI and Polzeath Coastguard teams.</p>

<p>James Instance, from Falmouth Coastguard, said: 'A couple of people had been out on paddleboards on the Camel Estuary with a flooding tide.</p>

<p>'With the water moving quite quickly, they had come off the boards and then got tangled in moorings in the area.</p>

<p>'That had caused a problem when they were unable to free themselves.' </p>

<p>The moorings in the Camel Estuary in Cornwall</p>

<p>Mr Instance said that despite a major rescue operation involving paramedics, the lifeboat crew and others, one of the males was declared dead at the scene. </p>

<p>As part of the rescue a local boat went in and managed to free him and recovered him into his vessel.</p>

<p>He said: They then tried to bring him to shore, but then got into a little bit of trouble and fired a red flare,'  </p>

<p>He added: 'It was very fast moving and dynamic. There were a lot of resources going in a somewhat confusing picture.</p>

<p>'Despite the best efforts that were put in by paramedics, the lifeboat crew and others, he was declared deceased at the scene.'</p>

<p>TV chef Gordon Ramsay purchased a 1920s property for £4.4million in Rock village 2015.  </p>

<p>Many boats are fastened to moorings buoys off Rock Beach, which are in turn chained to the sea bed.  </p>

<p>Paddle-boarding has ballooned in popularity in recent years and one of the fastest-growing water sports.  </p>
