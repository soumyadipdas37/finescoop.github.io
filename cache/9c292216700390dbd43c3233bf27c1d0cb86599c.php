<p>The TV presenter, 60, took to Twitter on Tuesday to respond to a post by First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon, who shared the story of the country's Justice Minister Humza Yousaf and his wife Nadia El-Nakla and their loss.</p>

<p>In her post, Nicola wrote: 'Brave account of miscarriage from ⁦<?php echo e('@'); ?>HumzaYousaf &amp; Nadia El-Nakla. It's an experience my husband &amp; I had just once, but it never leaves you. </p>

<p>'It never leaves you': Lorraine Kelly detailed her struggle with suffering a miscarriage in candid post shared via Twitter on Tuesday</p>

<p>'Nadia's account of the physical pain especially sparks awful memories. We don't talk about all this enough.'</p>

<p>Agreeing with Nicola's poignant post, Lorraine retweeted it and added: 'Affects far too many of us <?php echo e('@'); ?>nicolasturgeon and you are so right. It never leaves you xx'</p>

<p>Lorraine, who shares daughter Rosie, 26, with her husband of 28 years Steve Smith, previously revealed the devastating loss happened when her daughter was five. </p>

<p>Candid: Lorraine responded to a post by Nicola Sturgeon, who shared the story of husband and wife Humza Yousaf and Nadia El-Nakla and their loss, saying it 'affects far too many of us'</p>

<p>Loss: Lorraine, who shares daughter Rosie, 26, with her husband of 28 years Steve Smith, previously revealed the devastating loss happened when her daughter was five</p>

<p>In 2015, she told OK! Magazine: 'Another baby would have been super. But, hey, it didn't happen. I had a miscarriage when Rosie was about five.' </p>

<p>Rosie, who also spoke about the incident with the publication, said: 'I do remember. We were in Dundee. I was in the car with Dad following the ambulance. I was okay, though – I had no idea what was going on.'</p>

<p>In March, Lorraine spoke to Giovanna Fletcher on the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast about her loss, saying going through a miscarriage was 'really difficult'.</p>

<p>Experience: In 2015, Lorraine told OK! Magazine: 'Another baby would have been super. But, hey, it didn't happen. I had a miscarriage when Rosie was about five'</p>

<p>The TV presenter explained: 'That was a really difficult time and I think, yes of course we should absolutely sympathise with the women who go through this, but nobody asked after Steve.</p>

<p>'Nobody ever said 'How are you?' The only people who did, funnily enough, were friends that experienced it themselves and sadly as we know, far too many people experience it.</p>

<p>'I think we've got to be a bit more considerate about everyone and not just partners but extended family.'</p>

<p>Honest: Rosie (pictured in 2018), who also spoke about the incident with the publication, said: 'I do remember. We were in Dundee. I was in the car with Dad following the ambulance'</p>

<p>Detailing what helped her get through the difficult time, Lorraine went on: 'It was really sad but what did help me though was being open and talking about it at the time, because obviously I'm off work and you need to tell people why.</p>

<p>'That wasn't easy, but the response I got from viewers was unbelievable. I thought it was important to be honest. </p>

<p>'I felt we had to because viewers were asking what was wrong. We were just inundated with letters and really brave women sharing their experience with me. Really heartfelt. People took a lot of time and trouble.'</p>

<p>Last year, Lorraine also spoke to the BBC about how being open about her miscarriage and how talking about difficult issues is 'crucial' for our mental health.</p>

<p>Admitting she suffered personally when she went through a miscarriage and the menopause, she claimed the menopause left her feeling low and anxious.</p>

<p>The ITV presenter said: 'Five or six years ago, I suddenly felt really overwhelmed and anxious, and I'm not an anxious person. </p>

<p>'I'm somebody that just gets on with it, and I've usually got a sunny disposition, and I don't know where that went. All the life drained out of me, and I felt very flat.'</p>

<p>'I went on HRT [hormone replacement therapy], which I know doesn't work for everyone, but for me was an absolute game changer. So I thought, if it's happened to me, it's happened to lots of people.' </p>
