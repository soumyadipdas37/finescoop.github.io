<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool have reportedly finished their incoming business for this transfer window following the acquisitions of Thiago Alcantara and Diogo Jota last week. </p>

<p>A report in France Football on Tuesday stated that the Reds were still keen on strengthening their attack, with a £36m deal for Watford striker Ismaila Sarr and a loan move for out-of-favour Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele on the table. </p>

<p>However, after Jurgen Klopp moved for Thiago and Jota last week for a combined outlay of £65m, the Liverpool ECHO says those deals concluded Liverpool's transfer business in terms of signings this summer. </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has completed all his incoming business for this elongated transfer window</p>

<p>Yet the Reds continue to be linked with a £36million move for Watford forward Ismaila Sarr</p>

<p>Out-of-favour Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele has also been linked with a loan deal</p>

<p>The Reds earlier in the window also bought Greek left back Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiacos for £11.75m. </p>

<p>However, the report details that some members of the first-team could still be on their way out before the international transfer deadline on October 5. </p>

<p>The future of 20-year-old striker Rhian Brewster is not certain, with Crystal Palace interested in the England Under-17 World Cup winner. </p>

<p>Klopp would prefer a loan move for the young striker, who missed the decisive penalty in the Community Shield defeat to Arsenal last month, but the Premier League champions have not ruled out a permanent deal. </p>

<p>Liverpool completed the signings of Thiago Alcantara (left) and Diogo Jota (right) last week </p>

<p>But the Reds could still sell in this window, with forward Rhian Brewster linked with a move</p>

<p>Sheffield United are also eyeing a move for Brewster, who scored three goals in pre-season for the Reds. </p>

<p>Midfielder Marko Grujic, who spent the last two years on loan with Hertha Berlin, is another player who could leave Anfield in the coming weeks, as could Xherdan Shaqiri. </p>

<p>The Swiss international has struggled for form and fitness since his signing in the summer of 2018, with the Reds privately setting an asking price of £25m for the 28-year-old. </p>

<p>Serbian midfielder Marko Grujic has spent the last two seasons on loan in the Bundesliga</p>

<p>Xherdan Shaqiri struggled for regular minutes during Liverpool's title-winning campaign</p>

<p>Harry Wilson, who spent last season on loan at Bournemouth, is another fringe player who could be sold by the champions before the deadline in 12 days' time. </p>

<p>Newcastle United, Southampton and Leeds were all reportedly interested in the free-kick specialist. </p>

<p>Sarr, meanwhile, is also of interest to Everton and Manchester United, while Aston Villa have entered the race, believing the lure of first team football could swing things in their favour. </p>
