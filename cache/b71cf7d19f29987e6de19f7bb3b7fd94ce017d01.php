<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>California police have released bodycam footage that shows a Black Lives Matter protester being shot in the groin with a foam bullet during a march in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>The video shows 28-year-old photographer Ben Montemayor being shot by a 40mm foam pellet gun along Hollywood Boulevard on June 20.</p>

<p>Montemayor has already announced his intention to sue the LAPD, saying he required surgery afterwards, while police are carrying out their own investigation.  </p>

<p>Bodycam footage taken at a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles on June 20 showed the moment a police officer fired a foam bullet into an activist's groin</p>

<p>The bodycam footage was released Friday, as part of the police probe. </p>

<p>The footage shows a group of officers who were sent to tackle protesters who were gathering on part of Hollywood Boulevard on June 20.</p>

<p>In the video, officers run towards a junction of Hollywood Boulevard and another street as bottles are thrown at them, and attempt to clear the activists away.</p>

<p>Two protesters can be seen standing on the crosswalk holding a banner, one of whom has his hands raised in the air.</p>

<p>Officers take the banner away and push the man with his hands up away from the crossing. He takes a single step towards the officers, and is shot in the groin.</p>

<p>Montemayor told the LA Times that he was trying to help up a friend who had been pushed to the ground when he was shot.</p>

<p>He said fellow protesters helped him away from the scene, and that afterwards he went to hospital when one of his testicles swelled to twice its normal size.</p>

<p>Footage shows the man - who later identified himself as Ben Montemayor - standing in the middle of a crosswalk with his arms raised in the air</p>

<p>Police take his banner and push him out of the road, before opening fire as he takes a step towards them - which he said was to help a friend who was pushed over</p>

<p>He was taken in for emergency surgery which lasted around three hours in an attempt to preserve his ability to have children.</p>

<p>Montemayor has said he intends to file a lawsuit, and referred all questions to attorney Dan Stormer.</p>

<p>He described the shooting as a 'brutal assault' and said the video shows that 'in some ways, it's even worse than we thought.'</p>

<p>Dismissing the police investigation, he said the department were simply covering their own backs 'to protect themselves from the lawsuit that is coming'.</p>

<p>LAPD policy states that crowd-control weapons, such as foam bullets, should only be used on people that are more than five feet away.</p>

<p>Montemayor (obscured right, behind the officer's arm) has since announced he will sue the LAPD, which the department has launched its own investigation</p>

<p>California has seen near-continuous protests against inequality and police brutality that began in May after the death of George Floyd (pictured, marchers in LA the day before the shooting)</p>

<p>The shooting took place on June 20, a day after demonstrators took to the streets across the US for Juneteenth - marking the day the last Confederate slaves learned of their freedom</p>

<p>The weapons cannot be blindly fired into crowds, must be used against people who present a 'clear and immediate threat', and cannot be used to retaliate against verbal threats or because of 'noncompliance'.</p>

<p>California has seen near-continuous protests over racial inequality and police brutality that began in May in response to the death of George Floyd during an arrest in Minneapolis.</p>

<p>Protesters gathered in cities across the state on Saturday, June 20 - the date of the shooting - to call for greater equality across the country.</p>

<p>The day fell after Juneteenth,  the anniversary of the day on which the last slaves of the Confederacy learned of their freedom. </p>
