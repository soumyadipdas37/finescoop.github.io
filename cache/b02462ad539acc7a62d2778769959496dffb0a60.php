<p>Lisa Hay set fire to Catherine Siegers' house in Wangaratta in north-east Victoria on September 1, 2017.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old jumped Ms Siegers' fence to start the blaze from her backyard, with the 84-year-old lucky to escape with her life.</p>

<p>Hay denied any involvement in the blaze and lied to investigators during her police interview after the fire.</p>

<p>When asked if she had ever been in Ms Sieger's backyard before, Hay said 'no', despite detectives finding her fingerprints on the Colorbond fence separating the two homes.</p>

<p>In video obtained by 9News, Hay claimed to have slept through the blaze in her house next door. </p>

<p>'Didn't here a thing,' she said. </p>

<p>Judge Damian Murphy told Victoria's County Court Hay was a serial arsonist who was responsible for four other suspicious fires on her street alone.</p>

<p>'You have exposed an elderly lady to terrible danger and destroyed her lifetime memories,' Judge Murphy said, as reported by ABC. </p>

<p>'You are to be utterly condemned.' </p>

<p>Ms Siegers was asleep inside her home (pictured) when the blaze took hold and was lucky to escape with her life</p>

<p>Ms Siegers suffers from a heart condition and had to be taken to hospital after the fire suffering from smoke inhalation.</p>

<p>In an impact statement, Ms Siegers said all of her possessions were destroyed in the blaze and her health has never recovered.</p>

<p>'The stress of the night has taken its toll,' she said.</p>

<p>Hay was found guilty of arson and reckless conduct endangering life and was sentenced to three years and nine months.</p>

<p>She will be eligible for parole in 2022.</p>
