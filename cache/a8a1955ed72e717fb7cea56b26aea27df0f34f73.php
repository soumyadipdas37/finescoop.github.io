<p>Nick Diaz is planning a return to the octagon next year and has put himself through an intensive training regime, even practicing a weight cut.  </p>

<p>And Nate, who is two years younger than his brother aged 35, shared a black and white photo of them posing during training. </p>

<p>Nate Diaz posted this photo with his older brother Nick (right), who is making a comeback </p>

<p>Underneath the image re-tweeted by BT Sport, McGregor wrote 'line them up', his latest hint that his third 'retirement' may not last long. </p>

<p>A fight between either of the brothers and McGregor would of course deliver huge pay-per-view numbers. </p>

<p>The Irishman's last fight was at welterweight, which is reportedly where Nick is planning his return. </p>

<p>McGregor teased a return to action with his comment underneath the picture of his old rivals</p>

<p>A first encounter with the elder Diaz would be fascinating but many people still want to see a third battle with his younger sibling. </p>

<p>Nate fought McGregor twice at 170-pounds. He famously stunned the 'Notorious' with a submission win in their first encounter at UFC 196 back in 2016. </p>

<p>Then McGregor exacted revenge with a decision victory in their rematch that same year. </p>

<p>Their feud captured the attention of fans and made for compulsive viewing. McGregor is still training hard and many believe he will be back with the right offer on the table having called it a day for the third time in June.  </p>
