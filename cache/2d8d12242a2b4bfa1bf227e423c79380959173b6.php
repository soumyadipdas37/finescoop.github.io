<p>Uh oh: Molly-Mae Hague was spotted stepping out in Cheshire for the first time since it was claimed she had 'hippy crack' paraphernalia in her home</p>

<p>Molly-Mae wore a baggy muted ensemble while wearing her hair in loose lengths with half pulled up in a ponytail off her face.</p>

<p>She looked fresh-faced as she emerged in the baggy tracksuit with designer trainers as she made sure she put comfort first.  </p>

<p>Her outing comes days after she filmed a clip in her Cheshire flat as she spent the evening with her boyfriend Tommy Fury and their pal Maura Higgins.</p>

<p>While watching the video which was called My Wardrobe Transformation, eagle-eyed viewers noticed the box of canisters on her living room coffee table.</p>

<p>Hmm... Her outing came as fans called her out after they spotted what looked like 'hippy crack' laughing gas canisters in her flat as she filmed a video for YouTube  </p>

<p>Troubled: The Love Island star, 21, was going for a more pared-back look than usual on Friday as she stepped out in a tracksuit while going make-up free</p>

<p>During the video, Molly-Mae showed her fans around her home after making a spaghetti bolognese for Tommy and Maura, before revealing they were settling down to watch a film together.</p>

<p>As she brought the dinner over, she said: 'Spag bol, Tommy, and Bridesmaids,' referencing the movie on the TV.</p>

<p>However viewers noted the box of what looked like 'hippy crack' canisters on the table and the orange balloon which was lay next to Tommy.</p>

<p>Many of Molly-Mae's fans took to the comments section after noticing the box, with one person writing: 'Anyone else seeing the loons box when Maura is eating the pasta and the orange balloon on the sofa.' </p>

<p>Molly's rep had no comment when contacted by MailOnline. A source close to Molly insisted she had 'never done balloons', according to the Sun.</p>

<p>Friends: She filmed in her Cheshire flat as she spent the evening with her boyfriend Tommy Fury and their pal Maura Higgins (pictured last month)</p>

<p>Reaction: Many of Molly-Mae's fans took to the comments section after noticing the box</p>

<p>Maura and Tommy's representatives have been contacted for comment. </p>

<p>A source close to Maura told MailOnline: 'Maura was unaware that these were in the flat, she was just a guest at Molly and Tommy’s chilling out and enjoying dinner.'</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that Tommy has been associated with the so-called drug 'hippy crack'.</p>

<p>Off key: Molly-Mae wore a baggy muted ensemble while wearing her hair in loose lengths with half pulled up in a ponytail off her face</p>

<p>The boxer was allegedly filmed appearing to inhale it from a balloon before his appearance on Love Island in 2019.</p>

<p>In a video obtained by The Sun, the brother of boxer Tyson Fury was seen lying shirtless on the floor, seemingly having a reaction to the drug.</p>

<p>The video, which the website claims was filmed two months before he entered the ITV2 show, appeared to have been shot inside a friend's house, where Tommy rolls around on the carpet.</p>

<p>Others featured in the video with Tommy and are also seen inhaling from balloons.  </p>

<p>MailOnline contacted Tommy's rep and a rep at Love Island for comment at the time. </p>
