<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio (pictured) was struck on the arm by an electric scooter as he stepped on to a crosswalk in Lower Manhattan</p>

<p>The rider, who was travelling with his seven-year-old daughter, had not been wearing a helmet, according to The New York Post.</p>

<p>It is thought that the girl fell off the device and tumbled to the floor - but both father and daughter suffered only minor injuries. </p>

<p>The mayor reportedly checked on the pair immediately afterwards and offered a tissue to attend to minor scratches that were bleeding.</p>

<p>Bill Neidhardt, the mayor's press secretary, has since urged New Yorkers to take care and follow proper safety precautions.</p>

<p>He said: 'City Hall encourages everyone to obey traffic signals and wear a helmet.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year New York City Council voted on bills to legalize the use of electric bikes and scooters citywide.</p>

<p>Lawmakers had already approved the use of e-bikes and e-scooters statewide in April but the decision on how to regulate the vehicles was left to local officials.</p>

<p>It was hoped that a pilot program would also be created to bring a shared e-scooter program to neighborhoods currently lacking transit options and under-served by existing share programs like Citi Bike and Revel.</p>
