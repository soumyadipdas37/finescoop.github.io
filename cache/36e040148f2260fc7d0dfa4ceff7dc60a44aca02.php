<p>Romantic: April Love Geary took to Instagram on Tuesday to gush over her beau Robin Thicke as she shared a sweet snap of her sitting on the floor amid a display of rose petals</p>

<p>The beauty simply captioned the snap 'I love you' while tagging the Blurred Lines hitmaker.</p>

<p>It comes after April took to her Instagram stories to share a cryptic post about the responsibility of birth control.</p>

<p>In an apparent address to the ever increasing rumours that she's once again expecting, April re-posted a message which stated that men could impregnate numerous women and therefore should take more responsibility for birth control.</p>

<p>Happy couple: The 25-year-old's posts comes amid rumours she's expecting her third child with her partner, 43</p>

<p>It said: 'One man can impregnate 9 women every day for 9 months. Those are 2,430 pregnancies.</p>

<p>'One woman can only get pregnant once within 9 months, even if she beds 9 men every day within 9 months. That’s only 1 pregnancy.</p>

<p>'So clearly, society is placing the birth control responsibilities on the wrong gender. Science is busy making pills, and hormone-altering devices for the wrong person.'</p>

<p>Robin and April, who have been together since 2015, already share two young children – daughters Mia Love, two, and Lola Alain, one. </p>
