<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Around 60,000 Britons lost access to cash during the lockdown due to mass closures of bank branches and cash machines, research shows.</p>

<p>Up to 12 per cent of all branches and ATMs closed between April and June, according to the Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems Regulator. </p>

<p>It meant tens of thousands of adults did not have access to cash within a three-mile radius of their home.</p>

<p>Up to 12 per cent of all branches and ATMs closed between April and June, according to the Financial Conduct Authority and Payment Systems Regulator</p>

<p>The report says more than 5 per cent of regular bank branches remained closed at the beginning of June, when lockdown rules began to ease, and experts fear the figure could rise again as the UK faces the possibility of a winter lockdown.</p>

<p>Gareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, says: 'It's alarming that tens of thousands of people, many whom live in areas that were already struggling with cash access, were left high and dry when the coronavirus outbreak led to widespread closures of bank branches and cash machines across the UK.</p>

<p>'It's still unclear how many of these closures will be permanent. </p>

<p>'Having to travel several miles to withdraw cash is simply not a viable option for some consumers who rely on it to pay for essential goods and services.'</p>
