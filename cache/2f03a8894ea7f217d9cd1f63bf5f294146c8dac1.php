<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dele Alli and Jose Mourinho fell out before Tottenham's weekend defeat to Everton, according to Gabriel Agbonlahor, with the England star now a potential makeweight in Gareth Bale's sensational return.</p>

<p>Midfielder Alli was taken off at half-time for Moussa Sissoko on Sunday afternoon as Spurs opened their Premier League campaign with a 1-0 home loss.</p>

<p>And Agbonlahor has claimed Alli had a disagreement with Mourinho in the lead-up to the season opener.</p>

<p>Gabriel Agbonlahor has claimed that Dele Alli (pictured) had a fall-out with Jose Mourinho before Sunday's 1-0 defeat to Everton in Tottenham's Premier League opener</p>

<p>Alli and Mourinho have had a rocky relationship, as revealed by the recent Amazon series</p>

<p>He told talkSPORT: 'I feel like they need a No 10 as well because I'm hearing from a good source that Dele Alli and Mourinho have fallen out.'</p>

<p>It comes with Alli, 24, potentially on his way to Real Madrid as part of the deal that could see Bale return to north London.</p>

<p>Chairman Daniel Levy led high-level discussions on Tuesday with the result that Spurs are in pole position - ahead of Manchester United - to sign the Welsh star.</p>

<p>Sportsmail reported that Real will agree to pay in excess of 50 per cent of Bale's astronomical wages of up to Â£500,000-a-week in order to facilitate the deal.</p>

<p>England midfielder Alli was subbed off at half-time in a match Tottenham ultimately lost 1-0</p>

<p>Gabriel Agbonlahor said on talkSPORT that Alli and Mourinho had a disagreement</p>

<p>Tottenham are believed to have explored a loan or a permanent deal, which could include a swap for one of the club's premium first-team players, such as Alli, for Bale.</p>

<p>Alli has struggled to make an impression since Mourinho took charge of the club and the new Amazon documentary about the club reveals the manager has repeatedly questioned Alli's attitude.</p>

<p>Mourinho claimed Alli 'doesn't train well' and is 'lazy' in one of the episodes of 'All of Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur' and questioned his 'party boy' lifestyle.</p>

<p>Alli scored nine goals and contributed six assists in 38 appearances for Tottenham last season.</p>

<p>Tottenham are edging closer to a sensational deal which will see Gareth Bale return from Spain</p>

<p>Alli could be used as a makeweight in the deal, such is Tottenham's desire for Bale</p>

<p>Former England forward Agbonlahor also believes that Spurs urgently need another striker to ease the goalscoring burden on Harry Kane.</p>

<p>He said: 'I feel if they don't get a striker and get off to a bad start, I can see Mourinho walking or getting the sack.</p>

<p>'He is used to spending money. He is not used to begging for a striker.'</p>

<p>Spurs travel to Bulgaria on Thursday for their first Europa League qualifier against Lokomotiv Plovdiv.</p>
