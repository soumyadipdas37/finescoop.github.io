<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A five-year-old boy has been diagnosed with a brain tumour one month after his father died from the condition - which also claimed the life of his older brother.</p>

<p>Milo Hughes, from York, found out he had multiple brain tumours soon after the funeral of father-of-four Ian, who had passed away due to a glioblastoma.</p>

<p>The family had suffered further heartbreak six years earlier, when in 2014 Ian and Marie Hughes' son Oscar, nine, died following a six-week fight with another type of brain cancer, medulloblastoma.</p>

<p>'It is still heartbreaking, no matter how brave Milo is, to see him throw up, to have to hold him down as they put the dreaded wiggly line in,' Mrs Hughes said.</p>

<p>'The other night he turned to me and said "I don't want to die mum" and I can promise nothing and help little because although he says "it's my body and you can't do anything to it I don't want" we both knows that really what needs to be done will be done.</p>

<p>'I wonder if I will ever become immune to the pain around me, but of course you don't.'</p>

<p>Milo's father was diagnosed with a glioblastoma in 2019 after suffering a seizure. He died later in a hospice, leaving behind sons Sebastian, 17, Lucas, 11, and Milo. </p>

<p>Oscar was diagnosed in 2013 after doctors found a mass on his brain while investigating why he was so exhausted.</p>

<p>Mrs Hughes added: 'One early February morning, I heard a big bump from upstairs with lots of noise and told the boys to stay on the sofa whilst I ran up.</p>

<p>'Ian was having a massive seizure so I called 999 straight away. He was rushed into hospital and scanned and they found a mass on his brain.</p>

<p>'We were absolutely gutted.</p>

<p>Brain tumours are diagnosed in more than 11,000 people in the UK each year.</p>

<p>Of these, around half are found to be cancerous. </p>

<p>They develop when a growth of cells in the brain begins to multiply in an uncontrollable way.</p>

<p>An individual's risk of developing this cancer can depend on many factors, including age, genetics, lifestyle and your environment.</p>

<p>Risk is higher for those who have a close relative - ie. a parent, sibling or child - who has had a brain tumour.</p>

<p>A small number of these masses are related to genetic conditions, with those who have specific rare syndromes at increased risk of developing cancer.</p>

<p>These include: Neurofibromatosis; tuberous sclerosis; Li-Fraumeni syndrome; Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome; Turner syndrome; Turcot syndrome; Gorlin syndrome.</p>

<p>Brain tumours can either be benign - non-cancerous - or malignant, which are high-grace, cancerous tumours.</p>

<p>Symptoms vary depending on the part of the brain affected, but include:</p>

<p>'The two of us were in disbelief as not only had he survived a different type of cancer only three years before but the fact it was a brain tumour was just shocking.</p>

<p>'I remember sitting in the A&amp;E unable to speak as I just had no words for him. We both had an immediate feeling of doom.'</p>

<p>Milo is now undergoing chemotherapy, and has suffered hair loss and extensive permanent loss of vision and hearing due to his condition.</p>

<p>But his mother, 44, said despite the tumour, he 'looks like a healthy active boy,' who often sings and dances on his way back from the hospital.  </p>

<p>Mrs Hughes, who runs a charity dedicated to Oscar, said: 'Looking at Milo you'd think he was sailing through this apart from a few days which has seen him be sick every couple of hours day and night.</p>

<p>'Halfway through the fourth round of chemo and he couldn't wait to get in the paddling pool again. He sang, danced and laughed on the way back from the hospital.</p>

<p>'Oscar died before Milo was born but it's not difficult to find the similarities between them. The strength that pulled Oscar through is what is also pulling Milo through.</p>

<p>'Oscar didn't lose the fight because that would imply there was a fair fight to be had.</p>

<p>'Cancer is relentless.</p>

<p>'Oscar died but he had a great life and Milo is having a great life even through treatment and that's where we are.</p>

<p>'I have stopped looking to the next scan and we just live now.'</p>

<p>Mrs Hughes met her husband in a pub 19 years ago, and the pair moved in together after two months before marrying two years later.</p>

<p>They had always dreamed of settling down and having a family.</p>

<p>She said: 'I will always be grateful that I got to be loved by Ian and that my children had just him as a dad.</p>

<p>'Ian and Oscar were both huge Manchester United fans and had season tickets together with Sebastian.</p>

<p>'Ian and Oscar's love for sport meant they shared so many things together.</p>

<p>'Oscar was exceptionally sporty, he took it to a different level.</p>

<p>'At 6.30am before school, we'd hear a ball hitting the side of the house and we'd know he'd got up early again, got himself dressed and gone out to play tennis or football.</p>

<p>'All of the boys are incredibly resilient and I think Ian and I worked as such a great team together because we wanted the same - a family to love.' </p>
