<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former Myer model allegedly caught with cannabis in Bali was 'stockpiling' the drug to support his addiction during the coronavirus lockdown, a court has heard. </p>

<p>Jed Texas, 30, could face up to 20 years in the notorious Kerokoban prison if he is convicted of drug trafficking, which he denies.</p>

<p>Police claim they found 85.15g of marijuana and a scale in his luxury Bali villa after a raid in April.</p>

<p>Former Myer model Jed Texas, 30, (pictured) was 'stockpiling' cannabis to support his addiction during the coronavirus lockdown, a court has heard</p>

<p>The British-born model rose to fame after gracing the cover of Men's Health and shooting for companies like Toni &amp; Guy.</p>

<p>He was dropped by Sydney modelling agency Chic Management on Friday when news broke of his arrest in Indonesia. </p>

<p>Texas faced Indonesian prosecutor Nyoman Dewa Wira Adiputra via videolink this week as part of his trial for drug trafficking and possession, the Daily Telegraph  reported.</p>

<p>The court heard the model fled into the bathroom when officers stormed the room after receiving a tip-off.</p>

<p>Police officer Anak Agung Ketut Sugawirawan told the court they discovered marijuana in the toilet, as well as a scale and resealable plastic bags on his bed.  </p>

<p>The London born model who has also graced the cover of Men's Health Magazine and partied with Kate Moss, was represented by Sydney agents Chic Management until Friday </p>

<p>An image of nine bags of what appears to be cannabis were presented to the court as part of the prosecution's evidence.</p>

<p>While the model told the court that the drugs belonged to him after buying them for $60, he said the scales were nothing to do with the cannabis.</p>

<p>Texas' lawyer Deny Sedana claimed his client had been stockpiling the drug out of fear he would run out during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>'Jed Texas uses marijuana every day. If he doesn't use it, he can't think. He can use up to three times compared to addicts who only use it once per day,' Mr Sedana said.</p>

<p>'He first used it while still in England because of the trauma (caused when) his friend was murdered. He bought the marijuana for stock due to the pandemic situation.</p>

<p>So, it's not just for fun, but (Texas) is in a heavy addiction category.'</p>

<p>The 30-year-old has been awaiting his trial in Kerokoban prison since his arrest in April.</p>

<p>The trial will continue next week.  </p>

<p>Texas worked for Tom Ford and Burberry in their campaigns and appeared in Vogue and GQ magazines </p>

<p>Indonesia's strict drug laws carry a maximum sentence of 12 years for possession and 20 years for trafficking. </p>

<p>Texas, who changed his surname from Higgins, relocated to Australia from London in 2015 after working for top fashion label Vivienne Westwood in London.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old's modelling career took off after appearing as a teenager in gay magazine 'Attitude' which led to him being signed by Elite Management. </p>

<p>He completed a number of international assignments in the fashion capitals of Paris, Milan and New York. </p>

<p>He also worked for Tom Ford and Burberry in their campaigns and appeared in Vogue and GQ magazines.  </p>

<p>The lawyer told the court his client had become heavily dependent on the drug and was holding such a large quantity to support his addiction</p>
