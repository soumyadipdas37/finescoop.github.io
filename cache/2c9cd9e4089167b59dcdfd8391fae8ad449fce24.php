<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The giant megalodon is one of the most fearsome sea creatures to ever live and researchers finally know how enormous this goliath was. </p>

<p>With a dorsal fin as large as a fully grown human and a total length of 52 feet, the megalodon dwarfed the biggest shark alive today, the great white, which maxes out at about 20 feet long. </p>

<p>Gauging the size of the extinct giant fish is difficult because the animal had no bones.  </p>

<p>As a result, paleontologists had to estimate body size based on fossilised teeth, which are larger than a human hand, and five modern species. </p>

<p>Paleontologists believe the megalodon could grow to be almost as long as a double-decker bus at 52 feet. Mathematical calculations created estimates of its body's dimensions </p>

<p>A megalodon could grow up to 52 feet long (bottom) and ave a dorsal fin almost as tall as the average human. The biggest living species of shark is the great white (top) which grows up to 20feet long  </p>

<p>Researchers at the universities of Bristol and Swansea used mathematical methods and comparisons with living relatives to find the overall size of the megalodon.</p>

<p>The oceanic behemoth lived from about 23 million to three million years ago and has featured in Hollywood films, including the Jason Statham blockbuster, Meg.  </p>

<p>In the study, published in Scientific Reports, the academics estimate a body size of up to 16 metres (52 feet). </p>

<p>An individual of this size would likely have had a head round 15 feet long, a 5 foot 4 inch dorsal fin and a 12.6ft tall tail.  </p>

<p>This means an average sized adult human could stand on the back of the shark and just manage to peer over the top of the dorsal fin.  </p>

<p>A South Carolina couple made a surprising discovery while exploring the Stono River outside of Charleston – they found a prehistoric megalodon shark tooth larger than a human hand.</p>

<p>Jessica Rose-Standafer Owens and her husband, Simon Chandley Owens, were walking along a muddy riverbed when they spotted a pointy gray structure poking out of the ground that she was sure was a 'shark tooth.'</p>

<p>'If it's a tooth, it's going to be like biggest one we have ever found,' Jessica said during the video, while brushing away mud to reveal it was in fact a tooth.</p>

<p>The couple said the tooth is 5.75 inches from the tip to the root, weighs just under a pound and is three to five millions years old.</p>

<p>Jack Cooper, who has completed a master of science degree in palaeobiology at the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences, described the study as his 'dream project'.</p>

<p>'I have always been mad about sharks. As an undergraduate, I have worked and dived with great whites in South Africa – protected by a steel cage of course,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's that sense of danger, but also that sharks are such beautiful and well-adapted animals, that makes them so attractive to study.</p>

<p>'Megalodon was actually the very animal that inspired me to pursue palaeontology in the first place at just six years old, so I was over the moon to get a chance to study it.</p>

<p>'This was my dream project. But to study the whole animal is difficult considering that all we really have are lots of isolated teeth.'</p>

<p>Previously the fossil shark was only compared with the great white but the latest analysis was expanded to include five modern sharks.</p>

<p>The researchers first tested whether the modern animals changed proportion as they grew but found this was not the case.</p>

<p>'This means we could simply take the growth curves of the five modern forms and project the overall shape as they get larger and larger – right up to a body length of 16 metres,' Mr Cooper said.</p>
