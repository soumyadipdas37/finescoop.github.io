<p>A homeless man is pleading for the return of his beloved dog Shaggy (pictured), who he nursed back from the brink of death after finding her dumped in a bin</p>

<p>Now he is offering a $300 reward for the return of his best friend, who he credits with saving his life.  </p>

<p>Nathan said he made a promise to Shaggy to look after her until the day she died and would routinely go without so he could provide for her. </p>

<p>After finding Shaggy in the bin he took her to a vet and was told she had been badly abused, but he was determined to save the canine. </p>

<p>Nathan would set aside his own needs for Shaggy and hand feed her quality food while she slowly recovered. </p>

<p>'I'm very picky about what she eats. I saved her but really she saved me,' he said.</p>

<p>Ever since then the two have been inseparable, Nathan carrying her everywhere he went. </p>
