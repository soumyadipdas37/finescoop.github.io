<p>The Sterilight Robots have been used in hospitals and airports before, but this was the first time they sterilised a school.</p>

<p>The UV ray shreds and breaks down virus DNA. The robots headed into Three Towers Alternative Provision Academy in Hindley, near Wigan.  </p>

<p>Co-inventor Gary Oualnan said: 'Everything the light touches is steralised.</p>

<p>'This technology is new as it removes the need for any manual labour.</p>

<p>'Before, the robots would be programmed to do a few metres of work before the operator had to enter the room again and map out the next the next bit.</p>

<p>'The thing is humans can inadvertently miss certain areas or not expose them long enough.</p>

<p>'This technology completely rids itself of that.</p>

<p>'Similar technology was used against SARS a decade ago and was used in hospitals.</p>

<p>'We built on that to deal with coronavirus.'</p>
