<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas has leapt to the defence of defender Alvaro Gonzalez following Neymar's racism claim against the centre-back.</p>

<p>Neymar alleged that Gonzalez called him a 'monkey motherf*****' in a heated derby that saw five players sent off while 12 others were given yellow cards after a mass brawl broke out during the game at the Parc des Princes.</p>

<p>The £198m PSG and Brazil star was infuriated with the comments he alleges the Spaniard made, which resulted in him throwing a punch at his rival and subsequently being sent off in the Ligue 1 champions' 1-0 defeat to Marseille. </p>

<p>Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas has leapt to the defence of defender Alvaro Gonzalez</p>

<p>Neymar alleged that Gonzalez called him a 'monkey motherf*****' when PSG faced Marseille</p>

<p>Neymar was one of five players sent off after a mass brawl broke out at the Parc des Princes</p>

<p>But former Tottenham boss Villas Boas claims his side have 'no doubts' about Gonzalez said and said they will cooperate fully to ascertain the truth.  </p>

<p>'We are sure that Alvaro is not racist. I know him well, I know what he is, what he represents,' Villas Boas said.</p>

<p>'We have no doubts about what he said. We will help find the truth. Neymar knows the seriousness of his accusations.'</p>

<p>The comments come after Neymar admitted he 'acted like a fool' in his part of a mass brawl in the Ligue 1 clash but called out his opponent for the abuse he claims he suffered in an impassioned statement. </p>

<p>The Brazilian admitted he 'acted like a fool' after being sent off for punching the Spaniard</p>

<p>'Yesterday I revolted. I was punished with red because I wanted to hit someone who offended me. I thought I could not leave without doing something because I realised that those in charge would not do anything, did not notice or ignored the fact', Neymar said on his Instagram page.</p>

<p>'During the game I wanted to answer, as always, playing football. The facts show that I did not succeed, I revolted.</p>

<p>'In our sport, aggressions, insults, swearing are part of the game, of the dispute. You can't be affectionate. I understand this guy partly. All is a part of the game but racism and intolerance are unacceptable.</p>

<p>'I am black, son of black, grandson and great grandson of black also. I am proud and I do not see myself as different from anyone. Yesterday I wanted those in charge of the game (referees, assistants) to position themselves impartially and understand that there is no longer such a place for a prejudiced attitude.</p>

<p>But Villas-Boas claims Gonzalez did nothing wrong and that the club will cooperate</p>

<p>The comments come after Neymar told the Spaniard: 'You know what you said' in a statement</p>

<p>'Reflecting and seeing all the manifestation that happened. I am saddened by the feeling of hatred that we can provoke when in the heat of the moment we snap.</p>

<p>'Should I have ignored it? I don't know yet... Today, with a cool head, I say yes, But in due course my companions and I asked the referees for help and we were ignored. That's the point!</p>

<p>'We who are involved in entertainment need to reflect. An action led to a reaction and got to where it did. I accept my punishment because I should have followed the path of clean football.</p>

<p>'Racism exists. It exists. But we have to stop it. No more, enough!</p>

<p>'The guy was a fool. I also acted like a fool for letting me get involved in that. I still have the privilege of keeping my head up today. But we all need to reflect that not all black and white people are in the same condition.</p>

<p>'The damage from the confrontation can be disastrous to both sides. Whether you are black or white. I don't want to and we shouldn't mix subjects. Skin colour we don't choose. Before God we are all equal.</p>

<p>'Now... Yesterday I lost in the game and I lost wisdom... Being in the centre of this situation or ignoring a racist act will not help, I know,' he said.</p>

<p>'But pacifying this 'anti-racism' movement is our obligation so that the less privileged will naturally receive their defence. </p>

<p>'We will meet again and it will be my way, playing football.... Stay in peace! Stay in peace! </p>

<p>'You know what you said... I know what I did. More love to the world. #noracism #saynotoracism'</p>

<p>Neymar has called for an end to racist abuse after accusing Alvaro Gonzalez of the offence</p>
