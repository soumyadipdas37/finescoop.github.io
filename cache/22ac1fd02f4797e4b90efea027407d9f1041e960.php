<p>A three-day-old baby died after her parents fell asleep while she was being breastfed by her mother in bed, an inquest heard.</p>

<p>Luna Atkins had been at home for only a few hours when she died in the tragic bedroom incident. Parents Philippa Atkins, 34, and James Atkins, 35, had a 'celebratory glass of prosecco before retiring to bed'.</p>

<p>Recruitment company worker Mrs Atkins began breastfeeding Luna at around 9.30pm but both exhausted parents fell asleep.</p>

<p>But her mother woke four hours later to discover Luna was 'unresponsive' and was declared dead by paramedics 50 minutes later.</p>

<p>Luna was born two weeks premature on May 9 at 37 weeks by emergency Cesarean section.Â </p>

<p>She was discharged from the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff two days later around 5pm after doctors decided she was strong enough to return home with her parents.</p>

<p>A statement from police given to the inquest said: 'Luna was breastfed at around 9.30pm. Both parents fell asleep while she was feeding.</p>

<p>'Mum woke at around 1.30am on May 12 to find Luna unresponsive. CPR was commenced by family and paramedics who attended.'</p>

<p>Luna was declared dead at around 2.20am at their home in Roath, Cardiff.</p>

<p>Parents Philippa Atkins, 34, and James Atkins, 35 (pictured together on their wedding day), had a 'celebratory glass of prosecco before retiring to bed', an inquest heard.</p>

<p>A post-mortem examination was carried out but the cause of death was recorded as 'unascertained'.</p>

<p>At the short hearing in Pontypridd, coroner Graeme Hughes said: 'It remains for me to pass on my own condolences to Luna's family'.</p>

<p>A final hearing is scheduled to take place on July 27 next year at 10am.</p>

<p>Heartbroken mother Mrs Atkins is now fundraising to help other children - and described Luna as 'our beautiful baby' and 'our perfect little girl.'</p>

<p>She said: 'Luna has taught me life is too short and too precious! We owe it to her to fill the world with more music and more joy.</p>

<p>'So if you ever think you can't, look up at the moon, and my baby will show you that the world is good and you are loved!</p>

<p>Keen runner Mrs Atkins is now planning a half marathon in honour of Luna and other children by raising money for the Martha's Dancing Heart appeal to raise money for the Cardiff and Vale NHS Trust</p>

<p>'I got to carry Luna for 9 months, and hold her for nearly 3 days. I knew my daughter and she was good! She has given me the strength to believe in myself and strive to make the world a better place.</p>

<p>'Whatever you have been through, I am always here for you as you are there for me. As things start to go back to 'normal' let's strive to make it better.</p>

<p>'Let's laugh more and sing more. Let's never forget the tragedies of the last few months, and let's remember those we have lost in the best possible way.'</p>
