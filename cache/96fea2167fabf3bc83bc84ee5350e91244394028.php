<p>So it’s perhaps no surprise that this piece of coronavirus fashion – named the Covidisor – looks just like the transparent helmet worn by Tim Burton’s movie villains.</p>

<p>Covidisor – looks just like the transparent helmet worn by Tim Burton’s movie villains</p>

<p>The Covidisor uses negative air pressure to filter oxygen and can be worn comfortably for hours. </p>
