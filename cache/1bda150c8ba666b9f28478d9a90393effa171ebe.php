<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wycombe Wanderers will have to wait for their first point in the second tier of English football in their 133-year history after Rotherham's stoppage-time winner condemned them to defeat.</p>

<p>Gareth Ainsworth, the long-haired Wycombe manager whose love of rock 'n' roll is renowned, kicked and headed every ball on the touchline and exuded energy at Adams Park.</p>

<p>But he was left deflated when Rotherham's Michael Ihiekwe headed home the winner, and Wycombe's challenge for the season ahead in the Championship was laid bare.</p>

<p>Rotherham's late winner left Wycombe Wanderers deflated on their Championship debut </p>

<p>In truth, this was a cruel result on the hosts, who until they conceded had seen the better chances.</p>

<p>Above the Adams Park tunnel is a new sign. 'Our house, our rules,' it reads. That is Wycombe's mantra. They do things their way, and few teams go as direct as they do.</p>

<p>One early long ball was brought down expertly by striker Scott Kashket, who then crossed for Daryl Horgan. The 28-year-old slid to meet the ball, but missed from three yards.</p>

<p>Whenever Wycombe won a free-kick – even if 10 yards inside of their own half – the hosts treated it as an opportunity to score from a set piece.  </p>

<p>Wycombe Wanderers (4-2-3-1): Allsop; Grimmer, Stewart, Charles, Jacobson; Bloomfield (Freeman 67), Pattison (McCarthy 82); Wheeler, Horgan, Onyedinma; Kashket (Parker 87)</p>

<p>Substitutes not used: Stockdale (GK); Tafazoli, Phillips, Samuel</p>

<p>Manager: Gareth Ainsworth</p>

<p>Booked: Bloomfield</p>

<p>Rotherham United (4-4-1-1): Blackman; Harding, Ihiekwe, Robertson, Mattock; Ogbene, S. MacDonald, Lindsay, Sadlier (Wiles 67); Crooks (Smith 52); Ladapo (Vassell 83)</p>

<p>Substitutes not used: Johansson (GK); Jones, Miller, A MacDonald</p>

<p>Manager: Paul Warne</p>

<p>Scorer: Ihiekwe 90+2</p>

<p>Booked: Harding</p>

<p>Referee: James Linington </p>

<p>The ball would be lumped behind Rotherham's back line for the forwards to chase, in the hope a chance presented itself. </p>

<p>There was no Adebayo Akinfenwa on the pitch due to the 38-year-old's recent knee operation, though he was here at Adams Park, suited and booted, to support his team-mates.</p>

<p>After 20 minutes, Wycombe captain Matt Bloomfield committed a full-blooded challenge on Shaun MacDonald. He got the ball, but also his opponent's shin. </p>

<p>Rotherham called for a red card, and referee James Linington produced an instant yellow to defuse the situation.</p>

<p>Wycombe thought that was harsh, tweeting: 'You get away with those in League One.'</p>

<p>In the 34th minute, the hosts should have scored the opener. Joe Jacobson's free-kick cross from the left wing was met by Darius Charles, who crashed his shot against the crossbar.</p>

<p>Then at the other end, Rotherham were the ones with heads in hands, as Ihiekwe's attempt to nod the ball in at the back post went agonisingly wide.</p>

<p>After an entertaining first half, the second lacked excitement. With 20 minutes left in this match, there had been nothing worth jotting down in our notepads with chances hard to come by.</p>

<p>Ainsworth was animated on the touchline. 'James, James, what are you doing?' he yelled – forever bugging the referee whenever a decision did not go Wycombe's way.</p>
