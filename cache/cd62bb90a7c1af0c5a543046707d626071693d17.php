<p>The Secret Life of Us actor said: 'I'm super body conscious. And I feel like a gawky actor. I'm a lights off guy!' </p>

<p>He went on: 'This will be the hardest thing I've ever done. And I was on a unicycle, for 100 days in a row. Oh, man! It makes me anxious!' </p>

<p>Samuel added that he wasn't even sure he was much of a dancer, clothes on or off. </p>

<p>He went on: 'This will be the hardest thing I've ever done. And I was on a unicycle, for 100 days in a row. Oh, man! It makes me anxious!'</p>

<p>Scared: When asked how he felt about stripping naked, Samuel said he was 'a lot less secure' than the other men in the cast</p>

<p>When asked how he felt about stripping naked, Samuel said he was 'a lot less secure' than the other men in the cast. </p>

<p>'It's not about my feelings. It's about awareness, it's about encouraging people and it's about just being part of the team,' he declared. </p>

<p>One he began rehearsals, the Molly star started to get a lot more comfortable.   </p>

<p>'I am having a lot more fun than I thought I would. I thought it would basically be confronting, but it's a good group,' he said. </p>

<p>Raising awareness for cancer is close to Sam's heart, as he currently runs the Love Your Sister charity, after losing his sister Connie to breast cancer in 2017. </p>

<p>In it! One he began rehearsals, the Molly star got comfortable. 'I am having a lot more fun than I thought I would. I thought it would basically be confronting, but it's a good group,' he said</p>
