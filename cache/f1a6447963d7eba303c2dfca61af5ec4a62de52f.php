<p>Leap of faith: 135 people were attached to a bridge in Russia and made to fall simultaneously</p>

<p>Thrillseekers: Onlookers are heard cheering in delight as the group swing from the cords together</p>

<p>It is not known where the stunt took place or which world record they were attempting to beat.</p>

<p>It comes just months after footage emerged of a group of Russian thrillseekers wearing top hats and capes, throwing themselves into the belly of an abandoned cooling tower, kept safe by only a makeshift bungee rope.</p>

<p>The men were suspended from two ropes with the second taking up the slack as they plummeted towards the tower's concrete floor.</p>

<p>Homemade ‘rope jumping’ has become a popular underground sport in Russia over the last few years and there are reportedly several different clubs whose goal seem to be to continually top their own stunts.</p>

<p>Thrillseekers: A mass bridge jumping takes place in Russia in an attempt to break the world record</p>

<p>The first modern bungee jumps were made on 1 April 1979 from the 250-foot Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol, by members of the Oxford University Dangerous Sports Club.</p>

<p>The jumpers were arrested shortly after, but continued with jumps in the US from the Golden Gate and Royal Gorge bridges, spreading the concept worldwide.</p>

<p>The highest commercial bridge bungee in the world is currently Bloukrans Bridge Bungee in Africa, which has been operated commercially by Face Adrenalin since 1997.</p>
