<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's the former journalist, skincare entrepreneur and author who has just released a new children's book, called Back to Sleep. </p>

<p>And this week, Zoë Foster Blake was interviewed by comedian and TV star husband Hamish Blake in a bid to promote the book. </p>

<p>The pair appeared in a hilarious clip together from their Melbourne home, which showed Hamish pretending to be a TV host and asking rather outlandish questions for 'click bait.'  </p>

<p>'Have you had fillers and what celebrity do you hate?' Hamish Blake hilariously interviewed wife Zoë Foster Blake this week, in a bid to promote her new children's book</p>

<p>'Zoë, real name?' Hamish began, as the pair started laughing together.  </p>

<p>'Celebs write books sometimes, what celeb do you hate? Who is the worst celeb you've kissed?' he went on, as Zoë hilariously glared at him.   </p>

<p>'In this book there's a house that they live in. How much does your house cost? Got any fillers?' he went on. </p>

<p>Cheeky: 'In this book there's a house that they live in. How much does your house cost? Got any fillers?' Hamish asked his wife</p>

<p>Zoë quipped back, saying: 'No, no fillers. I don't have my lips done. Haven't had my hair or nails done in months.'</p>

<p>At another point, Zoë asked if he'd like to hear more about her book, when he jokingly replied: 'I think I've got the gist.' </p>

<p>Her new book is a tongue-in-cheek children's book about a young child who tries to go to sleep, but is being constantly woken up by his parents.</p>

<p>She joked on Instagram about the mock interview, saying: 'Since Covid and lockdown decimated my press tour, I was forced to appear on the only show I could: the one Hamish created in my house. What a pity.'</p>

<p>On Tuesday's episode of The Project, the 40-year-old was asked the most outrageous way the couple have been woken up in the middle of the night by their children, Sonny, six, and Rudy, three.</p>

<p>The beauty guru and bestselling author recalled how Rudy once alerted Hamish, who is arachnophobic, to a spider in the bathroom.</p>

<p>'Rudy recently woke up my husband saying there was a spider in the bathroom, and he should come and see it for a shock,' Zoë told guest panellist Annika Smethurst.</p>

<p>'He is arachnophobic, so that was a wake-up call for him!' she continued.</p>

<p>Zoë also revealed how Sonny once interrupted the couple watching a violent show on television, informing them of a hair clip he had found in his bed. </p>

<p>In an interview with The New York Times in March, Zoë, who is also the founder of skincare line Go-To, admitted that it can be hard juggling work and motherhood.</p>

<p>'I have a nanny who helps me three days a week, because if I didn't have those three days to work, I couldn't do any of this,' she said.</p>

<p>'My husband and I are a good team as well. I don't have an answer,' Zoë continued.</p>

<p>'I'm scattered and I get anxious and I get stressed like everybody. The best thing that I can do is compartmentalise.'</p>
