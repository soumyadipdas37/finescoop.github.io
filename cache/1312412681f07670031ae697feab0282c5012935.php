<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Football fans could soon be allowed to attend certain Champions League matches, with UEFA looking to work with local governments to determine which European cities are able to accommodate live spectators.</p>

<p>Following on from a limited attendance at the UEFA Super Cup final showdown between Bayern Munich and Sevilla in Budapest, Hungary, further pilot schemes are expected in the coming months to get fans back this season.</p>

<p>UEFA have taken steps to work with local governments around Europe to determine safe cities and stadiums which could permit a reduced number of supporters distanced within the ground, as report Mundo Deportivo.</p>

<p>A third of the stadium was allocated for use as Sevilla faced Bayern in the Super Cup final</p>

<p>The Super Cup final saw an allocated total of 20,000 people allowed into the Puskas Arena in Budapest, which seats 67,215. </p>

<p>Almost a third of the stadium was permitted for use, though only 15,180 turned out in total due to fewer tickets being taken on by supporters of Spanish giants Sevilla.</p>

<p>Mundo Deportivo state that on Monday UEFA will make an official statement confirming their plans to 'allow supporters in the stands of those stadiums whose local governments authorize it.'</p>

<p>Supporters were spaced out in allocated sections of the stadium, with masks encouraged</p>

<p>A quota of 20,000 people were allowed into the Puskas Arena in Budapest, though only 15,180 turned out after Sevilla fans did not fill their limited allocation</p>

<p>Stringent measures would be put in place at the designated stadiums, in order to allow fans to watch their team and financially support the football clubs involved without putting their own health at risk.</p>

<p>In Spanish football, like English football, supporters are still watching on from sofas as stadiums remain closed. </p>

<p>Further reports outline how Barcelona are among the many clubs who have already started to draw up provisional plans for getting fans back into stadiums.</p>

<p>Mundo Deportitvo state that the club will dictate that 85 per cent of tickets would be paid upon registration on a form, and a ticket allocation draw would be possible if there is more demand than supply.</p>

<p>A remaining selection of tickets would be for 'non-subscribers, partners and the general public.'</p>
