<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The family of a missing mother-of-two have accused a police force of making '27 key failings' in its investigation into her disappearance.  </p>

<p>Georgina Gharsallah vanished after leaving her mother's West Sussex home in March 2018. The investigation was upgraded to a murder probe last August.</p>

<p>Her mother Andrea fears the 30-year-old has been murdered or sex trafficked and said her family have since been forced to become the 'lead investigators'. </p>

<p>Mrs Gharsallah said it was, 'a role in which no mother or sister should be placed or want'.</p>

<p>The family identified a string of failings including key CCTV footage not being reviewed for more than a year, and a failure to place Georgina on an Interpol watchlist for more than 18 months.</p>

<p>They also say nine potentially significant segments of CCTV were lost by Sussex Police, 'without explanation.'</p>

<p>A former Met Police inspector claims the probe would have been handled differently if Georgina, 'had blue eyes and was middle class.'</p>

<p>Georgina Gharsallah vanished after leaving her mother's West Sussex home in March 2018</p>

<p>The last sighting of mother-of-two Ms Gharsallah on the day she vanished was in a mobile phone shop</p>

<p>Her mother Andrea fears the 30-year-old has been murdered or sex trafficked and said her family have since been forced to become the 'lead investigators'.</p>

<p>Ms Garsallah had moved back in with her mother ten days before she went missing after she split up with her boyfriend. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two was last seen on CCTV in a mobile phone shop in Worthing in West Sussex on 7 March, 2018, with 'a number of mobile phones'.</p>

<p>Ms Gharsallah was reported missing to Sussex Police on 17 March and has not accessed her phone, social media accounts or withdrew any cash from her bank account since she vanished. </p>

<p>Two men were arrested on suspicion of murder after a witness saw Ms Gharsallah talking to two men in Worthing, on the evening of March 7. They were later released with no further action. </p>

<p>Ms Gharsallah's family held a press conference yesterday after enlisting the help of investigative journalist Donal MacIntyre. </p>

<p>Mrs Gharsallah said there was internal review by Sussex Police into its handling of her case.</p>

<p>She said an account linked to Ms Gharsallah's handheld PlayStation console was billed £7.99 three weeks ago, which is now being investigated.</p>

<p>Mrs Gharsallah said police are now trying to contact Sony to get more information about the IP address - but claims detectives should have been monitoring this, rather than leaving her to find the bill and investigate. </p>

<p>The mother-of-two was last seen on CCTV in a mobile phone shop in Worthing in West Sussex on 7 March, 2018, with 'a number of mobile phones'</p>

<p>The family wants a new team led by the National Crime Agency to start from scratch and properly investigate Georgina's disappearance.</p>

<p>Mrs Gharsallah said: 'We have no idea if she is still alive, if she suffered, or where she may be.</p>

<p>'The police have completely failed to take my daughter's case seriously. The majority of CCTV was lost with some not even checked until a year later.</p>

<p>'We put our trust in Sussex Police but they failed us and neglected the investigation and our family.</p>

<p>'My daughter's investigation should never have been a learning curve to the police.'</p>

<p>They are being backed by former Metropolitan Police Detective Chief Inspector Clive Driscoll, who played a vital role in securing two convictions in the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation. </p>

<p>He said: 'The family has been wronged and Georgina didn't get the investigation she deserved. The investigation needs to be completely recommissioned from start to finish.</p>

<p>'It appears that some of the mistakes made by the Met Police Service - highlighted in the McPherson review into Stephen Lawrence's murder - have been made by the Sussex Police.</p>

<p>'There needs to be an IOPC investigation into these failings. Only for the dedication and determination of one mother, Andrea, have these failings come to light.'</p>

<p>He said he is 'really concerned' the investigation would have been treated differently if Ms Gharsallah 'had blue eyes, was middle class and had a different name'. </p>

<p>The family conducted independent searches without police assistance and conducted their own video reconstruction of Georgina's last steps, as well as operating their own crime incident room.</p>

<p>A £10,000 reward is on offer for information surrounding Georgina's disappearance.</p>

<p>In March, Chief Inspector Andy Wolstenhome said Georgina's social media and financial activity stopped when she disappeared.</p>

<p>He added: 'It is for this reason I am led to believe there is not an innocent reason for her disappearance.'  </p>

<p>Police described Ms Gharsallah as 5ft 2in tall, with shoulder-length dark hair, often worn in a top knot with a piercing above her left lip</p>

<p>A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'A full review of Sussex Police's investigation into the disappearance of Georgina Gharsallah has been completed by the Surrey and Sussex Crime Review Team.</p>

<p>'And we have shared our findings and recommendations with Georgina's family.' </p>

<p>Sussex Police claims it did not make 27 'key failings' in its investigation.</p>

<p>The spokeswoman added: 'A number of recommendations were made and these included areas of good practice and areas for learning, including the one significant missed opportunity in the CCTV investigative strand.</p>

<p>'Sussex Police will consider a voluntary referral to the IOPC after discussing this matter further with Georgina's family.'</p>

<p>Police described Ms Gharsallah as 5ft 2in tall, with shoulder-length dark hair, often worn in a top knot with a piercing above her left lip, adding she has 'Arabian features and speaks Arabic among friends'. </p>
