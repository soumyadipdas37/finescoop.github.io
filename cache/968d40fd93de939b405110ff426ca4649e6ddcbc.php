<p>The actor courted controversy in June this year month after a recent tweet he posted, which said: 'Every single human life is precious! The end!'  It is a clear nod to the Black Lives Matter protests sparked by killing of George Floyd by police officers. </p>

<p>He also penned a piece for The Spectator saying he would continue to speak out against the 'inconsistent god of progressivism'.</p>

<p>The star of ITV drama Lewis said on social media today is was the 'most painful cancellation I've had yet' after The Thick of It star disagreed with his #AllLivesmatter posts</p>

<p>The actor posted on Twitter today showing his exchange with The Thick of It star Rebecca Front</p>

<p>In the column he added: 'Righteous global outrage at a cruel and vile killing has morphed into a different agenda. </p>

<p>'Similar things have happened with other movements; #MeToo,Extinction Rebellion, Brexit, even the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>'The left rightly expose great chasms of inequality and hypocrisy in society — then proceed to throw themselves like lemmings into that void, unable to obey their own edicts.</p>

<p>'Desperately important causes have been politicised to the point of meaninglessness, opportunities for action hijacked swiftly by the cynical actors.'</p>

<p>Since then the actor has been using the #AllLivesmatter on a variety of Twitter posts on his account.</p>

<p>The actor courted further controversy after a recent tweet he posted, which said: 'Every single human life is precious! The end!</p>

<p>Today, Fox shared a screenshot of a conversation with Front. In the messages, Fox said: ‘Why would you block me? Have I said anything that could upset you? What a shame. Anyway, you are never blocked from me.’ </p>

<p>Front replied: ‘Oh Lol, I think it was the #AllLivesMatter stuff that finally tipped me over the edge It seems to me so glaringly obvious that All Lives Matter – you’d have to be a psychopath to disagree – that it should be equally obvious it doesn’t need a slogan. ‘Black Lives are systematically undervalued. Their work opportunities are fewer, their health outcomes far worse, the criminal justice system works against them. I think the least we can do is let them have a f***ing slogan. </p>

<p>‘But there are many, many things we clearly disagree on and, fond as I am of you, looking at your Twitter feed I just felt uncomfortable about the company you’re keeping. I’m sorry. I wish you and your lovely boys well. We’ll just have to agree to differ.’ </p>

<p>Fox replied: ‘“The least we’re can do is let them have a f***ing slogan.” Jesus/ ‘It’s ok to disagree. But it’s the right thing to do to talk first before you cancel me. </p>

<p>Especially given how racist the phrase you just wrote is. I thought we had more in common.’ </p>
