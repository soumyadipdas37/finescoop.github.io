<p>Prolific sperm donor, Joe (pictured with one of his children), with 150 children worldwide, has fathered a further six babies during lockdown after claiming COVID restrictions haven't slowed him down</p>

<p>With five women currently pregnant with 'Joe Donor's' unborn children, and one already having given birth this summer, the 49-year-old (pictured with one of the women he's impregnated, left and one of his children, right), from Vermont, is on target to impregnate 10 women this year</p>

<p>Joe (pictured with one of his children), who conceals his real name, has spent the majority of lockdown in Argentina after getting stuck there while donating his sperm</p>

<p>He said: 'I have about 150 kids worldwide but there's currently five women pregnant with my children and one already born.</p>

<p>'Coronavirus hasn't slowed me down and I feel busier than ever. I love seeing photos of the babies when they're born as a lot of them do look like me.</p>

<p>'I don't financially gain from providing my sperm to women, I just enjoy helping people. Luckily I run a few online businesses so I'm always available and can provide sperm whenever they're ovulating.</p>

<p>'I had travelled to Argentina to provide sperm to a few women who had contacted me online but I ended up getting stuck there until international flights resumed a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>But the singleton (seen with one of his children) is now in London and already set to meet five women this week</p>

<p>Thanks to Facebook and recommendations, Joe (captured with some of the children he's fathered) says he has been as busy as ever since March</p>

<p>'I'm now in the UK for a few weeks and hope to help as many people as possible fall pregnant.'</p>

<p>Joe has travelled across America, Argentina, Italy, Singapore, The Philippines and the UK donating his sperm.</p>

<p>He said: 'I have babies all over the world and although people always worry over incestual issues, that has never happened. I aim to donate my sperm for as long as it works which could be until I'm in my 90's</p>

<p>'I started donating sperm in 2008 and have fathered on average 10 children per year. I have always said I wouldn't father more than 2500 but that would technically be impossible unless I live until the age of 250. </p>

<p>Joe (pictured feeding one of the children he's fathered) hopes more British women in need of sperm will get in touch now they know he's in the country</p>

<p>Joe (pictured with two children) has unprotected sex with scores of women and claims to not make any profit from his donations</p>

<p>Joe offers both sexual intercourse and artificial sperm insemination - he claims about 50 per cent of his children are a result of having sex.</p>

<p>He added: 'I offer both options and although the natural way has a higher success rate, I do understand that it's not for everyone.</p>

<p>'Some of the women are lesbians and would not want to have sex while others are married but their husband's are infertile.</p>

<p>'There's not a single charge for the "sperm pot" as I do just enjoy making the world a better place. Some women do offer to help with travel expenses if they live far away. I always feel great when I know there has been a birth.'</p>

<p>Joe opts to have yearly medical checks to ensure he's practising as safe as possible.</p>

<p>He adds: 'I have a health check at least annually but if a woman requests more frequent testing, I will have another check on demand.</p>

<p>'There's always a risk as what I'm doing isn't regulated but women have checks during pregnancy too so they'd soon find out if they'd contracted a sexually transmitted disease, which has never happened.'</p>

<p>Joe is hoping to head back to his hometown after his UK trip but says he's happy to travel anywhere in the world to donate his sperm.</p>

<p>He added: 'I'm contacted by women all over the world via Facebook or email. I don't mind travelling as I can work wherever I need to in the world.</p>

<p>'I'm hoping that as lockdown eases in some parts of the world again that it'll be easier to travel more frequently.'</p>
