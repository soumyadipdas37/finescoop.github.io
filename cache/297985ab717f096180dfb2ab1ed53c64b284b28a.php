<p>It's a hogs life: Amber Turner and Dan Edgar looked in the throes of love as they filmed scenes at a pig farm on Wednesday</p>

<p>Amber shrugged a white leather jacket over her shoulders and added a touch of designer to her look with a Louis Vuitton cross-body bag.</p>

<p>She styled her blonde locks in soft waves and amped up the glamour with a full face of make-up. </p>

<p>Dan, 30, meanwhile looked dapper in a beige linen jacket, matching trousers and a white T-shirt.  </p>

<p>Farm life: Amber looked very unimpressed as she stared at a pig</p>

<p>The couple packed on the PDA as they strolled hand-in-hand around the pig farm before later joining Liam 'Gatsby' Blackwell and James 'Diags' Bennewith, 29. </p>

<p>Gatsby was a little overdressed to feed the pigs in his pink suit, while Diags cut a much more casual figure in a black jacket and jeans. </p>

<p>Amber watched from the sidelines as the boys played with their furry friends. </p>

<p>The couple firmly got back to reality after a sun-drenched getaway in Crete.  </p>

<p>All in the details: Amber complemented her chic outfit with a gold chain necklace </p>

<p>Petrified: Amber squealed as a pig chased her </p>

<p>Last month, ITV released a trailer ahead of its special reunion episodes that air in September. </p>

<p>The hit ITVBe show posted a video to Twitter full of key moments from the show's history including when Lauren Goodger pushed ex Mark Wright into a swimming pool.</p>

<p>Other hilarious parts include Sam Faiers asking for a vajazzle and Gemma Collins telling people to 'Google her'. </p>

<p>Run! The boys tormented Amber as they fooled around in the pig pen</p>

<p>Well hello there: Amber seemed taken with an alpaca as she took her phone out to video the animal</p>

<p>Having a blast: Diags appeared to be thoroughly enjoying the trip to the farm </p>

<p>Amber and Dan have been stronger than ever after spending lockdown together.</p>

<p>The couple rekindled their on-off relationship in May last year after a brief split which saw the Lothario pursue a relationship with his co-star Chloe Sims, 37.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty previously talked about how Dan has become a 'changed man' since they gave their romance another go.   </p>

<p>10 years of TOWIE: The cast have been busy filming upcoming scenes for the 10th anniversary, which will air this September</p>

<p>Amber told The Sun: 'Sometimes you have to go through really low points in life, and Dan admits what happened was a real low for him. He lost me. I was gone and he wasn't in the best place.</p>

<p>'When you lose someone it makes you realise how much you want them and need them in your life, he's not someone in their mid-20s anymore, he's mature and serious about life.</p>

<p>'Obviously joking around, but he has had his mid-life crisis already. Now he's such a changed person. He's so happy and focused on his future. I'm excited for the future with him.'</p>

<p>Say cheese: The couple beamed as they posed for a photo ahead of filming </p>
