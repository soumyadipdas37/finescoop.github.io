<p>Arabella's post comes after it was revealed earlier this month that her latest boyfriend is 'play 35-year old boy' Morad Izemrane.</p>

<p>The Love Islander and her new man were  seen looking close in Ibiza toward the end of August, just weeks after she went public with Josh Newsham and four months after splitting from Wes Nelson.</p>

<p>As well as unveiling Morad's identity, The Sun reported that he was arrested for stealing a pricey Rolex from a woman he had a tryst with in a toilet.</p>

<p>According to the publication, he was arrested on accusations of 'affectionate theft' against the Italian woman when attempting to fly from Ibiza to Palma the next day.</p>

<p>Morad - nicknamed 'Mojo' - previously dated Dutch model Estelle Cruyff, 41, who is the ex-wife of former Chelsea ace Ruud Gullit and niece of late football legend Johann Cruyff.</p>

<p>It's understood that Arabella was romantically involved with another man up to the moment she met Morad. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'She was seeing a rich guy called Mark and they were out at a party when his friend Mojo turned up with a bottle of champagne.</p>

<p>'Later that evening she took off with Mojo in his Ferrari, leaving her boyfriend Mark behind. That's how they met. It was pretty shocking. They've been together ever since. Arabella likes a good time and hasn't looked back.'</p>
