<p>More than 2,000 adults were quizzed to discover how much they know about their favourite beverages, as part of the study by Aldi. </p>

<p>But although 39 per cent of Britons like to think of themselves as 'wine aficionados' and 49 per cent call themselves spirit enthusiasts, more than half (59 per cent) were duped by the most common drinking myths. </p>

<p>In fact, nine per cent of adults revealed they live by popular phrase 'beer before wine, you'll feel fine', though scientists say this is no way to avoid a hangover. </p>

<p>There is also no magic formula for keeping fizz from going flat though 19 per cent believe a silver spoon in sparkling wine preserves the bubbles. </p>

<p>A typical Port can last for up to two months if kept in a dark, cool spot but 12 per cent of people think the fortified wine is good for a whole year once opened. </p>

<p>Aldi's 'Mistress of wine' Sam Capron said wine doesn't count towards your five-a-day due to the production process and the creation of alcohol (file photo) </p>

<p>More than half (52 per cent) are correct in thinking white wine is best served chilled, while 48 per cent think they should 'only' drink red wine at room temperature. </p>

<p>But experts insist that during warmer months red wines may be best if popped in the fridge for 20 minutes before serving. </p>

<p>The survey revealed one in 10 think gin deters mosquitoes, when it's actually the quinine in tonic. </p>

<p>More than 80 per cent of those surveyed didn't realise you could actually make gin from vodka.</p>

<p>Aldi's 'Mistress of wine' Sam Capron was quick to debunk the myth that wine qualifies as a portion of fruit of veg. </p>

<p>She said: 'Although wine is made from fermented grapes, sadly wine doesn't count as one of your five-a-day due to the production process and the creation of alcohol.' </p>

<p>Five per cent of those surveyed believe Swedish pop group ABBA is a type of beer</p>

<p>The research suggests lockdown has made people more adventurous, with one in four now wanting to learn more about alcohol and 52 per cent enjoying experimenting with different drinks.  </p>

<p>Wines were top of the list as 24 per cent said they tried new varieties, while 19 per cent turned their hands to cocktail making and sampling new beers. </p>

<p>The survey also found 17 per cent tried new ciders and spirits, while 13 per cent attempted their own wine and food pairings. </p>

<p>Director of Aldi Julie Ashfield said: 'The world of beers, wines and spirits is so varied and it's fascinating that people now want to learn more and that our customers have been experimenting with new and varied drinks over the last six months. </p>

<p>'Separating fact from fiction around our favourite tipples can confuse the best of us and even experts have been known to disagree but trying to navigate through them certainly makes for a fun challenge.'  </p>
