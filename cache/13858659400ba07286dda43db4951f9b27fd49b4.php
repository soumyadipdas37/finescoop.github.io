<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of mourners have gathered at vigils across America to pay their respects to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday after a battle with pancreatic cancer sparking a bitter war between Republicans and Democrats over her Supreme Court replacement. </p>

<p>Americans paid their respects to the legal pioneer and champion of women's rights at candlelight vigils and memorials stretching all corners of the country on Sunday evening, from the steps of the Supreme Court where she made history as only the second woman to serve as Supreme Court Justice to the school in Brooklyn, New York she attended as a girl. </p>

<p>Donations to the Democrats have topped $100 million in the days after her death, as the party demands the Trump administration sticks to the standard it set back in 2016 that a vacant Supreme Court seat must not be filled until after the election.  </p>

<p>Tensions continue to mount along partisan lines with Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell vowing to rush through a justice appointment while Democrats - and some dissenting Republicans - have blasted the move hypocritical and vowed to take unprecedented steps to derail their plans.  </p>

<p>Trump vowed to plow ahead with his Supreme Court nomination Saturday and urged the GOP-run Senate to consider it 'without delay'.  </p>

<p>The move comes just six weeks before the election and has sparked fierce debate, with many Democrats - as well as some Republicans - insisting the seat must not be filled until after the election.   </p>

<p>The crux of the debate centers around the move made by Republicans back in 2016 - and led by McConnell - to block then-President Barack Obama from appointing a new justice to the court nine months before the election.  </p>

<p>Justice Antonin Scalia died in February 2016 and Obama planned to appoint Merrick Garland to fill the position on the court.</p>

<p>Republicans refused to hold hearings or vote on a replacement until after a new president took office with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying: 'the American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. </p>

<p>OHIO: Mourners hold up candles, flowers and a picture of RBG as they await speakers at a vigil in Cleveland</p>

<p>OHIO: Justice Ginsburg died Friday night, which was the eve of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish new year</p>

<p>'Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.'  </p>

<p>The seat was not filled and two weeks after taking office Trump appointed his own choice Neil Gorsuch to the court instead.  </p>

<p>Democrats argue Republicans set a standard in 2016 by preventing an appointment during an election year and so now the shoe is on the other foot the same standard must now be honored.  </p>

<p>However, McConnell issued a statement Friday after news of Ginsburg's death broke backtracking on his stance in 2016, saying Trump's nominee would be voted for by the Senate. </p>

<p>NEW YORK: Mourners of all ages gathered at the vigil that included music and the blowing of a shofar, the rams horn that is traditionally part of the Jewish High Holiday services</p>

<p>'President Trump's nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the Unites States senate,' he said.  </p>

<p>Democrats have also pointed to there being more fraught timing with today's nomination than in 2016.  </p>

<p>In 2016, the position was empty nine months before the election, while Ginsburg's death comes just six weeks before the nation's votes are counted and a president revealed. </p>

<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Sunday said the nation was 'in an election' rather than close to an election this time as early voting is already under way in Virginia.</p>

<p>'People are already voting - it's just a few days away. We are not close to an election. We are in an election,' he said.</p>

<p>'To try and decide this at this late moment is despicable and wrong and against democracy.' </p>

<p>Democrats have put several options forward to stall or counteract Trump rushing through the appointment for Ginsburg's replacement, with several threatening to pack the Supreme Court while others have suggested pursuing impeachment charges. </p>

<p>Four GOP senators need to join the Democrats to stop a Supreme Court nomination going forward. </p>

<p>Two GOP senators - Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins - have already dissented, vowing to derail Trump's nomination plans until after the November 3 election. </p>
