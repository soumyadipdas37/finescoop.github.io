<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They recently made an uncharacteristically low-key arrival in the Italian city.</p>

<p>But Hailey Bieber sure made up for things as she put on a very glamorous display while stepping out with pal Kendall Jenner during Milan Fashion Week on Saturday.</p>

<p>The model wife of Justin Bieber, 23, stunned in a tailored monochrome blazer while fellow model Kendall, 24, looked chic in a brown maxi dress.</p>

<p>Stunning: Hailey Bieber, 23, put on a very glamorous display while stepping out with pal Kendall Jenner during Milan Fashion Week on Saturday</p>

<p>Hailey gave a glimpse of her toned midriff as she wore a tiny black bralette beneath the jacket, pairing her look with simple black leggings.</p>

<p>The beauty added towering, pointed heels to her look, while she carried her essentials in a mini Yves Saint Laurent handbag.</p>

<p>Hailey, who clutched a cup of coffee, kept her head down while she walked, while a majority of her face was concealed by dark sunglasses and a black face mask.</p>

<p>Looking good: Fellow model Kendall, 24, looked chic in a brown maxi dress which she teamed with chunky black boots.</p>

<p>Kendall meanwhile kept her look a tad more simple, with a plain, long-sleeved dress, which she teamed with chunky black boots.</p>

<p>She tucked a tiny black handbag in the crook of her arm, and like her friend, covered up with a face mask. </p>

<p>Milan Fashion Week is being held as a breakthrough for Italy, seven months on from when the country dealt with the devastating effects of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Already several well-known models have been seen in the city, with Irina Shayk and Brad Pitt's girlfriend Nicole Poturalski walking in the BOSS show on Friday.</p>

<p>Kendall's outing comes after her sister Kylie was left unimpressed by a snap shared by their eldest sister Kim Kardashian. </p>

<p>'Delete this immediately,' Kylie, 23, instructed Kim, 39, in the comments section of the photo, which was taken circa 2009 and posted Friday. </p>

<p>In response, Kim hilariously referenced P Diddy's penchant for shamelessly cropping out celebrities from his photos.  </p>

<p>'Should I Diddy crop you out?' Kim asked. </p>

<p>'Absolutely,' Kylie replied back.  </p>

<p>Throwback: Kendall's trip comes after her sister Kim Kardashian shared an epic throwback </p>

<p>Fine by me! Kylie approved a 'Diddy crop' of the photo, allowing her sister to shamelessly remove her from the image </p>

<p>Fans flooded the comments section, remarking on just how different everyone looked in the flashback photo than they appear nowadays. </p>

<p>The women did all look dramatically different, whether it be because of their young age at the time the snap was taken or because of their hair color. </p>

<p>Kendall flashed a sweet smile as she posed in the back, years before becoming a superstar in the world of modeling. </p>
