<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The prospect of having all your home renovations taken care of by a TV show might seem tempting, but in some cases it's definitely best not to hand over creative control. </p>

<p>BBC's Changing Rooms - the premise of which saw couples swap houses with friends or neighbours and decorate a room in each other's home - enjoyed  hugely popular run from 1996 to 2004. </p>

<p>Now, 16 years since the final series of the show presented by Carol Smillie aired, Bored Panda has put together some makeovers which have failed to stand the test of time.</p>

<p>Among them is a dated living room which was turned all-white, a bedroom transformed into a jungle and a bathroom decorated with flowers - lots of them. </p>

<p>Check out some of the most cringeworthy room makeovers below....  </p>

<p>BBC show Changing Rooms aired from 1996 until 2004. Some transformations did not air particularly well, such as this bedroom which went from a fairly drab setting to one with an 'arty' theme. The owner's response was 'good grief' </p>

<p>Changing Rooms was presented by Carol Smillie (front) and featured designers Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen (left), Andy Kane, Linda Barker, Graham Wynne and Anna Ryder Richardson</p>

<p>This living room went from something fairly ordinary to one which featured a very strong black and white theme. While the designer said, 'I think it's very classy,' the owner was less impressed. They said: 'Bloody hell' </p>

<p>This bedroom was transformed into what its designer called a 'sensual, sexy room'. Sadly, the owner felt differently and said 'I don't like the bed' and 'the colour is horrible'</p>

<p>This person's front room went from having boring curtains and old furniture to one with circular coffee tables boasting a dotted pattern. On the walls, a very quirky colour scheme was on display. Fortunately, the owner loved it and said: 'Am I in the same room? This is amazing'</p>

<p>This drab bedroom was turned into an exotic room which the designer described as 'very passionate'. Fortunately, the owner agreed and said: 'It is absolutely brilliant'</p>

<p>This transformation got a mixed response from the home's owner. They said: 'What a change. Crikey' when they spotted their new grey bedroom complete with a chandelier and cherub duvet cover </p>

<p>This living room was transformed from its fairly plain state into a much funkier hangout space. But it didn't go down well with its owner. They said: 'Oh no, it's horrible'</p>

<p>This living room and kitchen was given a contemporary feel with the addition of a curved sofa and some well-placed artwork. The owner was delighted. They said, 'There is nothing I would change. This is fabulous'. However, it is unlikely to be a look which would be popular now</p>

<p>The owner of this fairly boring bedroom got a surprise when the original double bed was turned into a four poster and the colour scheme turned an orange-red hue. The owner said: 'It is red, isn't it?'</p>

<p>This very boring sitting room was given a new, funkier look with some well-placed beer bottles, a new colour scheme, some plants and new sofas. The owner said, 'Barbara, it's gorgeous,' and 'look at the wall'</p>

<p>In this transformation, the living room walls were painted black before being shot with a paintball gun to give it a groovy effect. The owner said: 'I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it'</p>

<p>The owner of this home was a bit surprised by the transformation of their living room to a space with a rather green theme. They said: 'Not what I expected'</p>
