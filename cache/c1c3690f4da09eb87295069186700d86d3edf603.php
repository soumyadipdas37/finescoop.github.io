<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho is reportedly becoming increasingly frustrated with Tottenham for failing sign him a back-up striker for Harry Kane.</p>

<p>The Spurs manager has begun the season with Harry Kane still the club's only recognised centre-forward.</p>

<p>And The Sun claim the 57-year-old has told friends that he cannot believe a team of their stature is in such a position. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho is reportedly frustrated that Tottenham have not signed back up for Harry Kane</p>

<p>One of those friends is quoted as saying 'Tottenham is the only club in the world with one striker.</p>

<p>'It is the same as last season. Do fans really think Jose wants four left-backs, six wingers and one striker? It is incredible.'</p>

<p>It is easy to see why Mourinho would be unhappy when you compare his side's striking options with their closest rivals.</p>

<p>Arsenal have Eddie Nketiah, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang while Chelsea can call on the trio of Timo Werner, Tammy Abraham and Olivier Giroud.</p>

<p>Manchester City, meanwhile, have Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus and United boast Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford, Odion Ighalo.</p>

<p>Speaking about Tottenham's plans ahead of the window's October 5 deadline, Mourinho said: 'Is the club trying to build that balanced squad that we all want, yes we are trying. Let's see if that's possible.' </p>
