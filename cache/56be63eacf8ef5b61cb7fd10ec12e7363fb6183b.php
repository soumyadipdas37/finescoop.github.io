<p>The actress, 31, has told the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar that she wishes she had 'hung out with girl mates' more in her younger years, and that she often wants to be 'another person'.</p>

<p>On advice she would give her younger self, she told the publication: 'Don’t be obsessed by boys! Hang out with your girl mates. And don’t take everything so seriously – be kind to yourself!'</p>

<p>Lily James wishes her younger self 'had not been so obsessed with boys' - and still thinks of herself as a child.</p>

<p>Lily is thought to have spent the UK lockdown at home with actor Matt Smith - who she was dating, but had recently split from.</p>

<p>Despite this, she is also said to have struck up a connection with Captain America hunk Chris Evans, whom she is rumoured to be dating.</p>

<p>Musing on the last few months, she said: ‘Lockdown forces you to confront things about yourself, and part of stopping was realising that repeating yourself is the death of creativity.</p>

<p>'I just know that I want to try to stretch myself and become another person... I hope that’s what next year will bring.</p>

<p>‘Lots of girlfriends said to me, “Oh, you feel so much relief in your thirties, you know who you are.” I thought I was there, but then realised I’m actually not.</p>

<p>'I think I’ll probably always be quite a “searching” person... I can’t picture getting to a point where I’ll feel like, “Oh, I’ve grown.” I still feel like a child.'</p>

<p>Lily has taken the role of the second Mrs de Winter in Rebecca, and admitted it was the 'screwed up' nature of the character that attracted her.</p>

<p>'The first time I read the book, on a sleeper train in India, it had a huge impact on me. </p>

<p>'I took the role partly because this person’s journey is so profound, and I love that she sides with a murderer – I mean, that’s screwed up. I just thought: I want to get inside that woman’s head.' </p>

<p>On directing and producing in the future, Lily said: 'Making a film is such a crazy experience, and suddenly it’s done, and you have no control over it.</p>

<p>'I think that’s why I maybe want to direct and produce, because I’d like to be more involved.'  </p>
