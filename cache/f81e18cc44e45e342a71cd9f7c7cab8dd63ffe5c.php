<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jurgen Klopp is delighted that Liverpool have confirmed the signing of midfielder Thiago from Bayern Munich and has revealed he could play against title rivals Chelsea on Sunday.</p>

<p>The Spain international has moved to Anfield for a fee worth £25million including add-ons. </p>

<p>And Liverpool boss, Klopp, has revealed he can't wait to see him in action. </p>

<p>Thiago pulled on a Liverpool shirt for the first time after the Reds confirmed the deal on Friday</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has been chasing the Champions League winner and has finally got his man</p>

<p>'Great! Absolutely great. I’m really happy that it finally worked out and we could just do it, ' Klopp told Liverpoolfc.com. </p>

<p>'It’s very exceptional because in our situation, a lot of people around us talk constantly – ‘What are you doing? – bam, bam, bam. Then preparing something like this, working on all different things you have to work in a transfer like this – with thinking about a player like him already is a joy, to be honest, because it gives us obviously some options. T</p>

<p>'Then you get in contact with the boy and then you realise, OK, he obviously likes this project as well pretty much, even before he is here, which was really nice. I learned more and more about him as a person; the player I knew before, the person I learned. </p>

<p>Liverpool have confirmed the signing of Thiago Alcantara from Bayern Munich for £25million</p>

<p>Klopp has hinted their new signing could be involved against Frank Lampard's side on Sunday</p>

<p>'So I’m really happy to bring this wonderful person in as an add-on to the squad, which is just good for football reasons – but for all the other reasons as well. So, yeah, absolutely happy that he’s here.'</p>

<p>It might not be long before Liverpool fans see Thiago in action as Klopp has hinted he could be involved against Frank Lampard's side on Sunday.</p>

<p>'I didn’t make the squad now for Sunday. We will see what we can do. I didn’t meet him now, we had only phone calls and exchanged messages. </p>

<p>'So, let’s have a look how he feels. Around a transfer like this the days are pretty busy with things you usually don’t do. If he looks alright, we will find the right place for him.'</p>

<p>The 29 year-old has signed a four year contract at Anfield after joining Bayern Munich in 2013</p>

<p>Michael Edwards, Liverpool’s sporting director, had been in discussions with his counterpart at Bayern, Hasan Salihamidzic, and he made a breakthrough, with Liverpool guaranteeing to pay a minimum of £20m over the next four years.</p>

<p>Should Liverpool win the Premier League or Champions League again before 2024, they will have to pay Bayern another £5m and there are other bonuses should he win any individual honours during his time at Anfield.</p>

<p>Thiago arrived on Merseyside via a private flight to begin his medical on Thursday and now the formalities have been completed. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old was in talks with Bayern over a new contract but halted proceedings after deciding he wanted a new challenge. </p>

<p>Thiago said: 'I was waiting for this moment for a long time and I am very, very happy to be here'</p>
