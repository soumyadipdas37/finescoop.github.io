<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A crippled spider named Peggy who was nursed back to health has been released into the wild. </p>

<p>Elina Walsh, from Townsville, Far North Queensland, went viral after she found the huntsman with six legs missing and adopted her earlier this year. </p>

<p>Ms Walsh documented Peggy's recovery on a popular Instagram page and used the platform to share a video of the spider being set free on Sunday.  </p>

<p>Elina Walsh (pictured), from Townsville, Far North Queensland, adopted a two-legged spider named Peggy in June and nursed the huntsman back to health </p>

<p>Ms Walsh helped Peggy (pictured) regrow her legs and the spider was released into the wild on Sunday. Peggy's recovery was documented on Instagram and amassed 4000 followers</p>

<p>The footage showed Peggy darting around her enclosure, with all eight legs regrown, before running out of the container and into a garden.   </p>

<p>'Judging by how fast Peggy ran out of there it's safe to say she was ready to go back outside,' Ms Walsh said.</p>

<p>'It is a bit of a bittersweet moment for me but I'm happy she can finally live free like a normal spider again.'</p>

<p>The animal lover found Peggy inside her home and established the Instagram page, which has over 4000 followers, in June.   </p>

<p>Ms Walsh hand-fed the emancipated spider cockroaches twice a week and Peggy managed to regrow all her limbs after shedding her skin twice.     </p>

<p>The animal lover's compassion and care also earned her a Hero to Animals Award from animal activist group PETA.   </p>

<p>'Taking care of Peggy the last few months has taught me some new lessons on spiders, and no doubt you guys have learnt something new about them too. </p>

<p>Ms Walsh earned a Hero to Animals Award (pictured) from animal activist group PETA</p>

<p>Ms Walsh found Peggy (pictured) inside her home and hand fed the spider twice a week </p>

<p>'I hope that through Peggy's story I've been able to help others have a more positive view on spiders,' she explained.   </p>

<p>Ms Walsh said she suspected the arachnid had been attacked by a bird or a gecko and was initially going to put Peggy out of her misery.     </p>

<p>Early images showed Peggy with just two of her legs when Ms Walsh first started to care for her. </p>

<p>Other social media posts showed the spider eagerly devouring its dinner.</p>

<p>Peggy (pictured with two legs) moulted twice before properly regrowing her legs </p>

<p>More recent updates showed Peggy in the later stages of her regeneration with her legs regrown and stalking her prey.    </p>

<p>PETA spokeswoman Emily Rice said the organisation stumbled upon a Facebook post about Ms Walsh's efforts and wanted to recognise her. </p>

<p>'We take our hats off to this compassionate woman, who displayed great care and respect for Peggy and went above and beyond to save her life,' Ms Rice said.</p>

<p>'Spiders are sentient beings with a will to live, just like humans, and they all deserve the same kindness and respect that Peggy has been shown by Elina.' </p>

<p>The huntsman spider is not considered dangerous to humans.</p>

<p>The spider does possess venom and a bite can cause irritation but they are rarely known to attack.</p>

<p>Huntsman spiders usually choose to run away and hide rather than be aggressive.</p>

<p>They typically survive in homes or in the wild by eating pests including flies and various bugs. </p>

<p>They are native to Australia and similar species of huntsmen spiders can be found in the U.S. and most of the world.</p>
