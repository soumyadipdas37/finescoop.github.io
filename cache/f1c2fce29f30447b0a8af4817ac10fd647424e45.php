<p>The 34-year-old broadcaster garnered much adulation when she shared a video of herself donning a skimpy blue bikini for a tan tutorial on Instagram.</p>

<p>The star revealed that she had been subjected to some 'awful' comments for appearance. </p>

<p>Hitting back: It comes after Vogue was forced to hit back at trolls last week after she was body-shamed for her post-baby weight loss, six weeks after giving birth to her daughter Gigi </p>

<p>Captioning the silent clip of the fitness session, the Irish beauty wrote: 'There is no secret! I got a lot of comments and mails about the video I posted the other day. Mainly positive but my god there were some awful ones!</p>

<p>'I hate the term 'snapping back' it's not something I aspire to do after having a child nor do I think it's important. My body is different to other people's, I didn't do anything specific.</p>

<p>'I've only recently started training again, 4 times a week for 45 minutes a session. I try to eat healthily but I have not cut calories and eat a lot more than usual as I'm breastfeeding and it's important to keep calories up so you have a good milk supply.</p>

<p>'I trained the whole way throughout my pregnancy and I think that is a factor in the way I look now. I'm also VERY tall so there's a lot more room for a baby.' </p>

<p>Statement: Insisting that she 'shouldn't be made to feel bad' for her own body, the star shared a video of herself working out in a red top with black leggings as she shared her statement</p>

<p>Revealing that she's been a fitness devotee for almost half her life, she continued: 'I've trained since I was 16, for me it's a great thing not only for my body but for my mind too.</p>

<p>'At the moment I feel permanently exhausted but training gives me energy and keeps my hormones under more control (they are still all over the place a little as with any new mother).'</p>

<p>Addressing the tanning video directly, she said: 'I didn't post that video to show off my body. I have always done tan tutorials, I don't feel the need to hide my body because as I've read 'it's unrealistic 6 weeks PP'.'</p>

<p>'What should a body look like after a baby?' Vogue challenged. 'There isn't a set way it should look. I don't want anyone to feel bad about their bodies and I certainly don't want to be made feel bad about my own. ❤️.'</p>

<p>She then revealed that the new video was taken during a fitness session with celebrity personal trainer Dalton Wong, 'focusing on the tush'. </p>

<p>Despite having given birth less than two months ago, her abs, legs and arms all showed strong gym-crafted definition as she stood before the camera.</p>

<p>The seven-minute long clip started with her husband Spencer training the camera on his face as she stood behind him.</p>

<p>He soon stepped aside, with the help of a gentle playful nudge from his wife, as she unveiled herself in all of her bikini-clad glory.</p>

<p>As the video progressed, the Irish beauty was seen using products from her sunless tanning line, Bare by Vogue, which she applied to all areas of her skin. </p>

<p>Captioning the video, the star wrote: 'This one is for all the new tanners and people who want to apply their tan better! <?php echo e('@'); ?>barebyvogue will give you a glow like you’re just back from holidays but application is key to looking bronzed.</p>

<p>'After some fake tan disasters in my life (a lot of them) I have finally mastered applying my tan... if you want any tips ask below and I’ll answer.' </p>

<p>Vogue gave birth to Gigi Margaux on July 23 with husband Spencer, 33, and the couple welcomed their first child, son Theodore in September 2018.  </p>
