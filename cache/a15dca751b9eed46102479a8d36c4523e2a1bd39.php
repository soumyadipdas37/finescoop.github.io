<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Bachelor Sam Wood has created a lucrative fitness empire with wife Snezana Markoski, since meeting her on the 2015 season of the dating franchise.</p>

<p>But in an interview with Daily Mail Australia this month, Sam insisted he and his incredibly toned partner are not the 'ultimate fit couple'. </p>

<p>When asked how dedicated Snezana is when it comes to diet and exercise, the 40-year-old personal trainer described her routine as 'very normal'.  </p>

<p>'That's a nice compliment (the ultimate fit couple) but Snez is very normal,' Sam said.</p>

<p>'Snez would do three hard workouts a week with dumbbells or bodyweight from my 28 by Sam Wood program, one yoga session and just lots of walking with the kids.' </p>

<p>The couple, who have been surviving lockdown in Melbourne with their young family, always have plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables and produce on hand.</p>

<p>One hot mama: When asked how dedicated Snezana is when it comes to diet and exercise, the personal trainer described her routine as 'very normal' </p>

<p>Routine: 'Snez would do three hard workouts a week with dumbbells or bodyweight from my 28 by Sam Wood program, one yoga session and just lots of walking with the kids,' Sam said</p>

<p>Snezana, 38, and Sam share daughters Willow, two, and Charlie, one. Sam is also a stepfather to Snezana's daughter Eve, 15, from a previous relationship.  </p>

<p>'We always have fresh fruit and vegetables, but spending a little time on your Sunday to make healthy snacks like protein balls or a zucchini slice, can be a lifesaver,' Sam advised. </p>

<p>'The freezer is also your friend; if you're trying to avoid multiple supermarket trips, then don't be afraid to cook recipes in bulk, and stash some meals in containers in the freezer.' </p>

<p>While Sam often enjoys a run in the fresh air, he also incorporates some key exercises that can be done at home into his regime.  </p>

<p>'Nothing beats going for a run for your fitness and mental wellbeing, but if you are looking for a good at home option to get that heart rate up, try burpees, squat jumps, kick sits, ladder climbers and skipping,' Sam recommended.</p>

<p>'Complete each exercise for 40 seconds with a 20 second rest period, and four rounds for a 20-minute killer circuit.'   </p>

<p>And while one might assume Sam would be open to appearing on a fitness-based reality show such as Australian Survivor or SAS Australia, he says it's not this 'thing'.</p>

<p>'Those shows are fantastic but it's not really my thing. I move to feel good and be a good role model for my kids. When I get asked what I'm training for, I guess my answer is life,' Sam explained.    </p>

<p>No more TV: And while one might assume Sam would be open to appearing on a fitness-based reality show such as Australian Survivor or SAS Australia, he says it's not this 'thing': 'I move to feel good and be a good role model for my kids' </p>
