<p>The couple appeared surprised to discover that the toy did exactly what it was supposed to when it came flying back towards them as they larked about in a London park.</p>

<p>Learning to throw a boomerang is no laughing matter – just ask model Lara Stone and her boyfriend</p>

<p>Dutch star Stone, 36, and her new love David Grievson, a property developer, were forced to take swift evasive action when it swooped towards their heads on its return journey.</p>

<p>The pair ducked into a crouch and covered their heads, hoping that the boomerang missed them – and their pet dog.</p>

<p>Dressed in a pair of on-trend polka dot trousers and Birkenstock sandals, a clearly-relieved Lara then burst into gales of laughter when she realised they had avoided an embarrassing accident. </p>

<p>The fun-loving couple fell in love after meeting through the dating app Tinder in January 2018, more than two years after Stone split from her former husband, David Walliams.  </p>

<p>She began dating the Britain’s Got Talent judge in September 2009 and announced their engagement just four months later. </p>

<p>They married at Claridge’s hotel in London in May 2010 with a no-expense-spared wedding and a star-studded guest list.</p>

<p>Three years later, Lara gave birth to the couple’s son, Arthur. </p>

<p>But following a trial separation, Walliams filed for divorce, citing ‘unreasonable behaviour’, in September 2015.</p>

<p>The pair ducked into a crouch and covered their heads, hoping that the boomerang missed them – and their pet dog</p>
