<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For the first time in nearly a century the iconic Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade will not be taking to the streets of New York City.</p>

<p>At a press conference on Monday Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the parade will be held virtually this year due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>'It will not be the same parade we're used to,' de Blasio said. '[Macy's is] reinventing the event for this moment in history. And you will be able to feel the spirit and the joy of that day.'</p>

<p>The parade will not be live this year but viewers can watch it online and on TV, the mayor said, adding that Macy's will release additional details soon.</p>

<p>He praised the retail giant for successfully adapting its Fourth of July fireworks display and expressed excitement for how it will reimagine the parade as well.  </p>

<p>'There are some things we still can't do,' de Blasio said in reference to the parade. 'We're looking forward to a lot of them coming back in 2021.'</p>

<p>Macy's addressed the upcoming changes in a post on its website, writing: 'Following our successful, safe and innovative production of Macy's 4th of July Fireworks®, it is our intention to similarly reimagine Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade this November.' </p>

<p>This is a developing story. </p>
