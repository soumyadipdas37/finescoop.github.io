<p>Appearing from home in Los Angeles, Sarah sat alongside Holland as they waited for the results of the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie category.</p>

<p>Support: Sarah Paulson, 45, sat in on Holland Taylor's, 77, Emmy Award nomination on Sunday night, with the couple sharing sweet moments during the virtual ceremony</p>

<p>The couple of five years shared a laugh as they sat alongside one another, with nominee Taylor looking chic in a printed shirt, while Sarah wore a black and white high-necked number.   </p>

<p>Jimmy Kimmel hosted 72nd Emmy Awards at Staples Center in Los Angeles without a studio audience amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic with nominees watching remotely. </p>

<p>The awards show on ABC featured presenters in full hazmat gear, personally delivering awards to winners' homes.</p>

<p>Nominated: Appearing from home in Los Angeles, Sarah sat alongside Holland as they waited for the results of the Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or TV Movie category</p>

<p>Sarah and Holland began dating in 2015 and have been inseparable ever since, with Sarah previously defending their 22-year age gap during a May interview, declaring: </p>

<p>'If anyone wants to spend any time thinking I'm strange for loving the most spectacular person on the planet, then that's their problem.' </p>

<p>The couple recently revealed they split their lockdown time between their two houses in Los Angeles, which are just a five minute drive between each other.</p>

<p>Having a good night: Taylor was nominated for her role in Hollywood, but lost out to Mrs America star Uzo Aduba</p>

<p>Speaking to Vulture Holland explained the couple have had to reconfigure their relationship in order to stay safe. </p>

<p>'We spend the long weekend up at her house, and I’m by myself here [Holland's house] for two days, and we spend one day together here [Holland's house] . So we go back and forth.,' she explained of their living arrangement.</p>

<p>Holland confessed that all the moving around from house to house has helped with her state of mind during this 'really, really strange' time, and that she won't be able to go back to work until the dangers of the virus have subsided, with the exception of 'very unique circumstances.'    </p>

<p>'I don’t know what it will be like when actors can really be in a big film production, 150 people,' she added.</p>

<p>Laughs: The couple of five years shared a laugh as they sat alongside one another, with nominee Taylor looking chic in a printed shirt, while Sarah wore a black and white high-necked number</p>

<p>When asked if their living situation is the ideal relationship scenario of having time together and apart, Taylor agreed, for the most part. </p>

<p>'I think it is. I mean, we're mostly together, and we both have a little time where you just don't have anybody to answer to, without any sort of accommodating someone else's plans,' she said.</p>

<p>'So it’s good for me because I'm older, and I've been so independent all my life, so it works out well.' </p>

<p>Happy: Sarah and Holland began dating in 2015 and have been inseparable ever since, with Sarah previously defending their 22-year age gap</p>
