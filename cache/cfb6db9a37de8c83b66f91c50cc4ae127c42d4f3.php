<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Army has named a four-star general to launch a new investigation into how leaders at Fort Hood handled Vanessa Guillen's reports of sexual harassment, her disappearance and death.</p>

<p>The embattled base in Killeen, Texas came under scrutiny when the 20-year-old specialist vanished in April after she told her family she was being sexually harassed by a superior. Her remains were found buried and dismembered two months later.</p>

<p>This year alone 23 soldiers have died at the base with at least five of those deaths linked to foul play. </p>

<p>General John Murray, the head of the Army’s Futures Command, will conduct the new investigation into the base that's already undergoing an independent review issued by the Army.</p>

<p>He’s slated to arrive at Fort Hood in two to three weeks, according to CBS News.</p>

<p>The Army has named four-star general John Murray to launch a new investigation into how leaders at Fort Hood handled Vanessa Guillen’s reports of sexual harassment, her disappearance and death. He’s slated to arrive at Fort Hood in two to three weeks</p>

<p>The embattled base in Killeen, Texas came under scrutiny when the 20-year-old specialist vanished in April after she told her family she was being sexually harassed by a superior. Her remains were found buried and dismembered two months later </p>

<p>He is senior to all the generals in the chain of command at Fort Hood meaning he has the authority to recommend disciplinary action against them.</p>

<p>'There are currently several investigations underway at Fort Hood which are tasked with reviewing a wide range of topics and concerns,' the Army said in a press release.</p>

<p>'Gen. Murray will roll those efforts into a more complete and comprehensive investigation that will delve into all activities and levels of leadership,' the Army added.</p>

<p>The investigation was announced on Tuesday, the same day the Army announced Fort Hood commander Major General Scott Efflandt was removed from his post. </p>

<p>The probe will assess Efflandt’s actions. He will remain at Fort Hood until the investigation is completed.</p>

<p>A new commander will be named for the 1st Armored Division in the coming days.</p>

<p>The commanding general of US Army Forces Command, Gen. Michael Garrett, has directed Maj. Gen. John Richardson IV to formally assume the role of acting commander at Fort Hood from Wednesday, an Army statement read.</p>

<p>The decision comes following a string of 23 tragedies and deaths, according to CNN. </p>

<p>According to officials, the deaths include seven off-duty accidents, seven suicides, one combat-related death, four homicides, one of which was on the base, two of natural causes, one that was undetermined pending an autopsy, and one drowning. </p>

<p>Fort Hood is home to 36,500 soldiers.</p>

<p>Guillen disappeared on April 22 after telling family members that she was sexually harassed by her superiors on two different occasions.</p>

<p>A Fort Hood investigation couldn’t corroborate her claims that she was sexually assaulted on the base.</p>

<p>Her remains were found on June 30 and July 1. Her suspected killer was fellow soldier Specialist Aaron Robinson who died by suicide when officers moved into arrest him on July 1.</p>

<p>A criminal complaint released the following day revealed Robinson’s girlfriend Cecily Ann Aguilar, 22, told investigators Robinson killed Guillen by hitting her in the head with a hammer.</p>

<p>The girlfriend and Robinson then dismembered her body and disposed of it near a river.</p>

<p>An attorney for Guillen’s family claim Robinson also harassed Guillen.</p>

<p>Murray’s investigation is separate from an independent review of Fort Hood’s command climate ordered by Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.</p>

<p>He said in a visit to the base earlier this summer that Fort Hood has one of the highest rates of murder, sexual assault and harassment in the Army.</p>

<p>The most recent death was Fort Hood soldier Sgt. Elder Fernandes.</p>

<p>Fernandes, 23, was reported missing on August 19. </p>

<p>Killeen police said he had not been seen since August 17 when his staff sergeant dropped him off at home. His body was found a week later on August 29.  </p>

<p>Fernandes was found 30 miles from the Texas base where he was stationed, police said last month. </p>

<p>Fort Hood public affairs officer Lt. Col. Chris Brautigam later confirmed Fernandes had reported sexual abuse before his disappearance and was transferred to another unit, 'to ensure he received the proper care and ensure there were no opportunities for reprisals.' </p>

<p>Khawam, a lawyer representing the family of Vanessa Guillen, another Fort Hood soldier who went missing and was found dead, and now the Fernandes family, told ABC News that Elder got 'very, very depressed' after being sexually harassed.</p>

<p>Other soldiers to have died this year include: Pvt. Mejhor Morta; Spc. Francisco Gilberto Hernandezvargas; Pfc. Brandon Scott Rosecrans; Spc. Freddy Delacruz Jr; Spc. Christopher Wayne Sawyer; and Spc. Shelby Tyler Jones.     </p>
