<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The influence of Carlo Ancelotti on and off the pitch is obvious. On it, Everton's improved team shape is evidence of his good work on the training ground. </p>

<p>Off it, the arrivals of James Rodriguez and Allan proves the calibre of player he is able to attract.</p>

<p>Dominic Calvert-Lewin will benefit from working with Ancelotti, who got the best out of Filippo Inzaghi. He was lethal in the penalty box, and Calvert-Lewin is looking more predator-like, too. </p>

<p>Carlo Ancelotti's influence on Dominic Calvert-Lewin (pictured) at Everton is obvious</p>

<p>Calvert-Lewin will benefit from working with Ancelotti, who got the best out of Filippo Inzaghi</p>

<p>The striker's first three starts of 2019-20 under Marco Silva saw him manage two touches in Crystal Palace's box, one inside Watford's, then one inside Aston Villa's. In a later trip to Burnley, he managed zero inside their box. </p>

<p>Ancelotti arrived in December, claiming he had been monitoring the youngster while manager of Napoli. </p>

<p>His first match in charge, at home to Burnley, saw Calvert-Lewin net the winner and touch the ball seven times inside their box. </p>

<p>That is what Ancelotti wants from his strikers and last Saturday against West Brom, the 23-year-old scored a hat-trick — all from around the six-yard box.</p>

<p>That did not happen by accident. It came courtesy of his anticipation and movement, which he is honing under Ancelotti.</p>

<p>Under Ancelotti, Calvert-Lewin is looking more predator-like and is looking lethal in the box</p>

<p>The touch maps above highlight how Dominic Calvert-Lewin's game is evolving under Carlo Ancelotti, with the blue dots indicating his touches.</p>

<p>The map on the left is from last season against newly-promoted Aston Villa under Marco Silva. Calvert-Lewin touched the ball once inside the opposition box and didn't score. On the right is Calvert-Lewin against newly-promoted West Brom last weekend. He touched the ball seven times inside the box — four inside the six-yard box — and got a hat-trick.</p>

<p>After the West Brom win, Ancelotti said: 'I had a fantastic striker in Filippo Inzaghi, who scored 300 goals and 210 with one touch. A striker has to be focused in the box and Calvert-Lewin understands this.'</p>

<p>Richarlison was pushing up alongside Calvert-Lewin against West Brom while Rodriguez was coming inside from the right wing.</p>

<p>When central, the Colombian is lethal from long range and possesses great vision in finding runners. His beautifully-timed ball over the top for Richarlison led to one of Calvert-Lewin's tap-ins. But it was Rodriguez's switching of play to the left that stood out. He completed five passes to left back Lucas Digne and seven to left-sided midfielder Andre Gomes.</p>

<p>It's a nice ball that Rodriguez can play into Digne's path but I want to see Everton feed their Brazilian more. Richarlison holds the most potential. He can be a big match-winner for Ancelotti.</p>

<p>Everton's front three is set in stone but there is competition for places elsewhere in their 4-3-3, particularly in midfield.</p>

<p>Richarlison holds the most potential at Everton and can be a big match-winner for Ancelotti</p>

<p>Gomes might not be defensive enough and Abdoulaye Doucoure got used to roaming at Watford and now needs to show more discipline. Doucoure is a great signing but Grady Diangana was allowed to run through unopposed to open the scoring for Albion.</p>

<p>Allan's spot seems safe, but Bernard's midweek performance at Fleetwood suggested he is pushing to start, potentially ahead of Gomes. And judging by Niels Nkounkou's display down the left, Digne has competition, too.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, central defenders Michael Keane and Yerry Mina might not have enough pace and mobility, while Jordan Pickford was excellent at Tottenham but strangely nervous against West Brom, then at fault for both goals at Fleetwood. Still, there's been a big improvement under Ancelotti.</p>

<p>1 – Chelsea have kept just one clean sheet in their 20 Premier League away games under Frank Lampard – a 2-0 win at Tottenham in December 2019.</p>

<p>Crystal Palace's players are completely committed to Roy Hodgson's tactical plan. They've scored early and beaten Southampton and Manchester United with just 29 and 24 per cent possession. They have scored a goal for every 115 passes!</p>

<p>Palace's formation is listed as 4-4-2 but it's more 4-2-4 when they're pressing, and Wilfried Zaha is looking stronger than I've seen him previously. He gets his body between his marker and the ball, and wins free-kicks which offer Palace respite.</p>

<p>One quirk of Hodgson's system sees wingers Andros Townsend and Jeffrey Schlupp turn into makeshift full backs. </p>

<p>Against United, the right and left backs, Joel Ward and Tyrick Mitchell, would press, and Townsend and Schlupp would drop to fill the hole. If Palace time it wrong, then the opposition could do damage, but it worked against United. Let's see how it goes against Everton.</p>
