<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mystery lottery winner who only had hours left to claim a staggering £58m jackpot has come forward.</p>

<p>The lucky punter, who purchased the winning ticket in South Ayrshire, hit the jackpot on March 17 as the country went into lockdown.</p>

<p>The winner stands to pocket a massive £57,879,670 prize that had been set to pass a deadline of midnight on Sunday. </p>

<p>Lottery chiefs have revealed they are currently processing a payout for the prize and added no further details could be released. </p>

<p>A claim was staked in April for the jackpot, but Camelot has not yet revealed whether it passed the process of validation or if another person has since come forward.</p>

<p>The lucky winner will immediately rocket on to the list of the richest people in the country.</p>

<p>They will rank alongside stars such as Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, Manchester United's Paul Pogba and One Direction's Zayn Malik.</p>

<p>The successful numbers on the ticket bought for the March 17 draw are 5, 7, 8, 16, 20 with Lucky Stars 2 and 12.</p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Camelot, which has run The National Lottery since 1994, said: 'We can confirm that we are currently finalising the validation of a claim made on this prize and are in the process of arranging for payment to be made to the ticket-holder.</p>

<p>'Once the prize has been fully validated and paid, we'll issue confirmation of that - but there will be no further updates before then.</p>

<p>'Please note that we don't comment on the details of individual prize claims and that, unless the winner of a major National Lottery prize opts to take publicity and signs an agreement to that effect, no further information can be released about their win.'</p>

<p>The ticket, worth £57,869,670, was bought in South Ayrshire. A claim was staked in April but Camelot has not revealed if it passed the process of validation (file photo)</p>

<p>Players are given 180 days to make claims on prizes but if nobody hands over the lucky ticket then the cash will be handed to good causes.</p>

<p>In 2012, a Euromillions prize fund of £65million was distributed to good causes after the winning ticket, bought in Hertfordshire, went unclaimed.</p>

<p>The winners of Scotland's largest lottery pot, Colin and Christine Weir from Ayrshire, won £161million on Euromillions in 2011.</p>

<p>Across all lottery games in 2018, a whopping £125.1million went unclaimed.</p>

<p>A British EuroMillions winner who scooped a life-changing £58million has revealed how he was forced to celebrate with his parents through a window due to the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>Ryan Hoyle, a father-of-one who is split from the mother of his 11-year-old daughter, won the £58,366,487 jackpot, lottery operators Camelot revealed in April. </p>

<p>But Mr Hoyle, from near Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was unable to celebrate face-to-face with his parents, who were in lockdown in their own home. </p>

<p>Ryan Hoyle, 38, was revealed as the winner of a £58million EuroMillions jackpot</p>

<p>He said: '(When I found out) I was shaking and really needed a second opinion so I jumped in the van and drove round to mum and dad's house.</p>

<p>'I stuck to the government guidelines and kept a safe distance outside and passed the phone through the window for them to double-check for me.</p>

<p>'They even checked my numbers against another website, just to be sure. It was real - I had won £58million.</p>

<p>'Dad congratulated me from inside their house whilst Mum shouted out if she could retire now?! I replied yes.' </p>

<p>The self-employed joiner discovered the win at 6am the following day</p>

<p>Mr Hoyle discovered that he had won the £58m jackpot prize while checking his online lottery account at 6am on Saturday, April 18.</p>

<p>The winning main numbers were: 16, 28, 32, 37, and 45 while the winning EuroMillions lucky star numbers were 01 and 11.</p>

<p>The joiner said he typically purchases lottery tickets in store but due to the coronavirus lockdown, he had started to purchase tickets online.</p>

<p>'I always wake up early and was sat on the edge of my bed but couldn't work out what I was looking at,' Hoyle said.</p>
