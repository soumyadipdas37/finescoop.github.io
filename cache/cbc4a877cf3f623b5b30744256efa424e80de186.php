<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A four-year-old, dubbed the 'Fijian Princess' has been captured on camera speeding past eight of her opposition footy players to score a try - before running right off the field. </p>

<p>Eva Hicks plays in the nappy grade for Sydney's South Eastern Seagulls in the under five reds.</p>

<p>She was captured making an incredible line break in a match at Pioneer Park in Malabar, beating eight other players as she sped down the side line.</p>

<p>But instead of scoring a try, Eva ran underneath the fence at the back of the ground and rushed back up the sideline for a hilarious moment for the gallery of spectators. </p>

<p>Eva Hicks (pictured) made an incredible break for the South Eastern Seagulls at Pioneer Park but instead of scoring a try, the four-year-old ran back through the crowd of spectators</p>

<p>'It was typical day at nappy grade football really,' Eva's Mum Rhiannon Hicks told Today. </p>

<p>'The girls and boys get on there week after week and play so hard, but there's a lot of funny moments.'</p>

<p>Mrs Hicks said her daughter loves playing rugby league and could not believe she ran as far as she did.</p>

<p>'She's improved out of sight,' she said. 'The fact that she ran that far is mind blowing to be honest.</p>

<p>'As she kept running I turned to my husband and said "what is going on?" And he just shook his head.</p>

<p>'She had the biggest grin, enjoying herself and that's what kids sport is all about.'</p>

<p>Eva's Mum Rhiannon (pictured together) said Eva loves to play league and she couldn't believe how well she ran</p>

<p>Mrs Hicks said Eva loves playing with her friends, even though there are a few tears most weeks after taking a big tackle.</p>

<p>'She's a Fijian princess so she can cop it,' Mrs Hicks said.</p>

<p>'She got back on a couple minutes after that and actually scored a try in the next session we had. </p>

<p>'She's pretty brave. We told her that you've just got to get up and keep playing the ball and she does that with a smile most weeks.'</p>

<p>Mrs Hicks said the fact Eva gets up early in the morning to put her boots and take to the field shows how much she loves playing rugby league. </p>

<p>'I always thought she'd be a netballer, but she seems to like footy,' she said. </p>

<p>Mrs Hicks said Eva's performance (pictured right) was a 'typical day at nappy grade' for the 'Fijian princess'</p>
