<p>The footage was captured at around 10pm in Truckee, California, and shows two bears wandering around on the front yard of a property.</p>

<p>As one bear walks out of the shot, a second comes straight towards the front door and jumps up, resting its paws on the house.</p>

<p>The footage of the bear (pictured) was captured at around 10pm in Truckee, California, and shows the animal ringing a house doorbell with its paw</p>

<p>As the animal does this, it accidentally rings the doorbell, and its ears prick up with surprise at the noise. </p>

<p>It even raises a paw to the camera and sticks its nose to the lens for a close up shot before wandering off. </p>

<p>The footage was captured on September 7.  </p>

<p>The owner of the home said that they thought it was a prank when they heard their doorbell ring at such a late hour.</p>

<p>Two bears wander outside the property and as one bear walks away, a second comes straight towards the front door</p>

<p>They were still up working and heard the sound which 'alarmed them' as they live in a quiet neighborhood.  </p>

<p>They said: 'We decided to check the doorbell cam before going downstairs to answer the door. </p>

<p>'We both laughed hysterically when we saw the bears. When we finally opened the door, they were gone. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately, the video only captured one ring. But it's still pretty funny.' </p>

<p>The population of black bear in California is estimated to be between 30,000 and 40,000.   </p>

<p>The owners of the home 'laughed hysterically' when they realised it was bears ringing their doorbell and not a prank </p>
