<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Serena Williams has tipped her close friend Lewis Hamilton to make history, as they both go for landmark victories.</p>

<p>While Williams begins her French Open campaign trying to equal Margaret Court's record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles, Hamilton is one Grand Prix victory away from drawing level with Michael Schumacher.</p>

<p>Given Hamilton's form this year, and the American's traditional struggles on the clay, he is likely to pass his target before she does hers.</p>

<p>Serena Williams (not pictured) has backed Lewis Hamilton (above) to make F1 history this week</p>

<p>Hamilton can equal Michael Schumacher's record of 91 Formula One wins on Sunday in Sochi</p>

<p>'The guy is such a champion, he has such a champion's mindset,' said Williams. ' I look at what he does training, physically, his job, there's really no words for it, to be honest. He is for me the greatest driver that our generation has seen.</p>

<p>'I'm confident that he will break the record of Michael Schumacher, who was also a fabulous driver. </p>

<p>'But Lewis is so intense. If you know anything, even if you're a fan, you know he lives his life on his sleeve. </p>

<p>Williams (above) is one triumph away from Margaret Court's record of 24 ladies singles titles</p>

<p>Williams (above) and Hamilton are close and the tennis star claims he is an emotional man</p>

<p>'Lewis and I are super close. I've known him for years. I love that guy. He's a really good friend of mine.</p>

<p>'He's very emotional. He says what he says. That's just who he is. He doesn't care who you are. That's one thing I've grown to really appreciate about him, as well.'</p>
