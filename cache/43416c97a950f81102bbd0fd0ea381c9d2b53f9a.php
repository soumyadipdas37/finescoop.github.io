<p>Happy: Joe Swash treated his family to a gleaming Volkswagen T6 camper van on Friday to create 'memories' and travelled hundreds of miles to the north of England to pick it up </p>

<p>Joe, who shares one-year-old son Rex with Stacey, described how he couldn't 'wait to make some memories' as he showed his followers the 'new addition' to the Swash/Solomon family.    </p>

<p>Sweet: Stacey, who is also mum to sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, shared a heartwarming picture of her three boys and Joe in the back of the camper van</p>

<p>However Loose Women panellist Stacey was not exactly impressed with the van which she described as a 'monstrosity'. </p>

<p>Speaking on her Instagram stories, she zoomed in on the motor from the upstairs window and said: 'Oh my God - what the hell Joe?' </p>

<p>Joe, who is dad to son Harry, 13, from a previous relationship, added: 'Our new home on wheels mate - our new home do you like it?' </p>

<p>The mother-of-three playfully pushed a beaming Joe onto the bed adding: 'When did you get that?' </p>

<p>Surprise: Loose Women panellist Stacey was not exactly impressed with the van which she described as a 'monstrosity'</p>

<p>Stacey captioned her post with a laughing face emoji and penned: 'When he gets something in his head...</p>

<p>'Is he actually joking... I was so tired last night I walked passed that monstrosity thinking someone had parked up and gone to the pub or something only to find out it's ours apparently.' </p>

<p>Yet Stacey, who is also mum to sons Zachary, 12, and Leighton, eight, later shared a heartwarming picture of her three boys and Joe in the back of the camper van. </p>

<p>Playful: Joe, who is dad to son Harry, 13, from a previous relationship, added: 'Our new home on wheels mate - our new home do you like it?'</p>

<p>She penned: 'Those faces though... I knew once he'd got this idea into his head it was inevitable...</p>

<p>'I didn't realise how soon though. Usually it takes him a week just to text me back so I thought it'd have years before he made this happen. </p>

<p>'I am excited for him and the boys and our adventures. I love them so much and making memories with them is my favourite thing in the world. So here we go. </p>

<p>'First memory they will have is the school run. Bye bye normal car hello camper.' </p>

<p>The VW camper boats plush leather seats and vibrant blue LED lighting across the top of the window along with a mini oven and fridge. </p>

<p>Southlands Motor Company shared a picture of Joe with his thumbs up alongside the van and described how the motor was 'custom built' to their requirements. </p>
