<p>Uploading a clip of Sean's back as he played Call Of Duty, the beauty wrote: 'This is how we spend our Sunday's.'</p>

<p>With Sean fully immersed in the game while wearing his headset, it was clear that Jesy wasn't impressed by his lack of attentiveness as she added a GIF which read: 'I need attention.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month, it was alleged that her hunky new beau is on celebrity dating app Raya.</p>

<p>In a screenshot of his profile obtained by The Sun, Sean's cover image is a shirtless snap and lists his profession as acting and his location as London. </p>

<p>It is unclear whether Sean's dating app profile is an active profile or an old one from before he started dating the singer. </p>

<p>Revelation: Earlier this month, it was alleged that her hunky new beau is on celebrity dating app Raya</p>

<p>Stunner: Jesy was seemingly unfazed by her beau's profile as she posed up a storm on Instgram</p>

<p>Raya is a private members-only app where users must be invited and have to link their account to their Instagram page.</p>

<p>Although the service was originally just for dating, features now promote professional networking for those in the entertainment industry. </p>

<p>A representative for Jesy declined to comment. MailOnline also reached out to Sean's representative. </p>
