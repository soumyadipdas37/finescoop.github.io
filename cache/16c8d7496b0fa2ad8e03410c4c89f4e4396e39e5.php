<p>National winter crop production is forecast to increase 64 per cent this financial year, according to the latest federal agriculture forecast.</p>

<p>That's 20 per cent above the 10-year average after decent rain in many parts of the country.</p>

<p>New South Wales is on track for its second-biggest winter crop in a decade as production bounces back in many drought-ravaged areas of Australia</p>

<p>NSW is tipped to lead the recovery, with production expected to soar 300 per cent on last year to its highest level since 2016/17.</p>

<p>ABARES executive director Steve Hatfield-Dodds said crop prospects are strongest in NSW where winter rain and a strong start to the season have driven higher production.</p>

<p>'Increased production in New South Wales has accounted for 60 per cent of the forecast increase in production nationally,' he said.</p>

<p>Crop prospects are average to above average in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and southern Queensland, despite warmer than average temperatures and below average rainfall in June and July.</p>

<p>Soil moisture and timely rainfall sustained established crops during those months.</p>

<p>Farmers received a welcome boost in August, with rain falling at the right time to bolster yield prospects in many regions.</p>

<p>National winter crop production is forecast to increase 64 per cent this financial year, according to the latest federal agriculture forecast</p>

<p>Central and northern Queensland were not as lucky with not enough August rain to achieve average crop yields.</p>

<p>Mr Hatfield-Dodds said area planted to winter crops was estimated to have increased 23 per cent to 22.6 million hectares from last year's drought-affected season.</p>

<p>'In New South Wales, the area planted is estimated to be six million hectares - almost double that from 2019-20.'</p>

<p>The Bureau of Meteorology's latest three-month climate outlook indicates spring rainfall is likely to be above average in most cropping regions.</p>

<p>In WA the forecast is mixed, with below average spring rainfall most likely for the Geraldton zone and part of the Kwinana zone.</p>
