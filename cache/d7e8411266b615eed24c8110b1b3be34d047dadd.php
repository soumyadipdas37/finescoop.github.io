<p>Amateur official Satyam Toki was left with excessive bleeding above his eye after he was hit three times by a player he sent off in a pre-season friendly last month in Acton, west London.</p>

<p>At a London FA hearing over the weekend, the referee's attacker was suspended from all football activity for 10 years - the maximum punishment that can be issued for assaulting a match official.</p>

<p>The player who punched a referee in a grassroots football match has been banned for 10 years</p>

<p>Satyam Toki was left with bleeding above his eye after he was hit three times by a player</p>

<p>However, Toki has now called for the FA to review their laws and introduce lifetime bans for players found guilty of such an offence.</p>

<p>He told Sportsmail: 'I am quite happy because at least the maximum sentence from the FA has been handed out. I was worried it was only going to be five years.</p>

<p>'But it could have been better. It could have been a lifetime ban. In my opinion, the FA should change their regulations to give lifetime bans.'</p>

<p>Toki has now called for the FA to introduce lifetime bans for players who commit these crimes</p>

<p>Toki is officiating his first match since he was attacked on Tuesday, having told Sportsmail he was scared to referee again following the incident on August 9.</p>

<p>The train conductor has also pressed charges against the player - who we are not naming but represented Hackney Sunday League side Sporting Club de Mundial - and is now waiting for the outcome of the criminal investigation.</p>
