<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ravel Morrison has signed for Dutch side ADO Den Haag until the end of the Eredivisie season.</p>

<p>Former Manchester United midfielder Morrison, 27, has joined his 11th club following his release from Sheffield United in the summer.</p>

<p>Den Haag technical director Martin Jol, who has had spells in charge of Tottenham and Fulham, told the club's official website: 'Ravel has actually not quite fulfilled his great promise.</p>

<p>Ravel Morrison was famously hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson as a teenage with Manchester United</p>

<p>Morrison's patchy career continued with an unproductive spell at Sheffield United last season</p>

<p>'That's partly due to the fact that he went to West Ham United and major Championship clubs early in his career.</p>

<p>'His forays in other countries were not conducive to continuity in his career, but we hope that Ravel can show his qualities on the Eredivisie podium.'</p>

<p>Morrison made his first-team debut for United aged 17 before moving on to West Ham in 2012, and during his time there had loan spells at Birmingham, QPR and Cardiff.</p>

<p>He made only three appearances for latest club Middlesbrough, who he joined on loan in January, and has also had spells with Ostersund and Lazio.</p>
