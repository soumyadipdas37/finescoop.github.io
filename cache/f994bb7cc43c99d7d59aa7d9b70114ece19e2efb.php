<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A star-studded France line-up including the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and Paul Pogba ruled the world two years ago as they lifted the most-coveted prize in international football.</p>

<p>Their progress following that success in Russia has been halted somewhat due to the lack of action caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>But next week the international calendar finally resumes and Les Bleus boss Didier Deschamps can start building for the re-scheduled European Championships next summer and their World Cup defence a year later.</p>

<p>France boss Didier Deschamps can start building for re-scheduled European Championships</p>

<p>His side ruled the world two years ago as they lifted the most-coveted prize in world football</p>

<p>He has named his squad for Nations League clashes but Man City's Aymeric Laporte is absent </p>

<p>Deschamps named his squad for their UEFA Nations League matches against Sweden and Croatia earlier this week and what was evident was the wealth of talent he has to pick from.</p>

<p>Yes, Manchester United midfielder Pogba and Tottenham's Tanguy Ndombele were forced to miss out after testing positive for Covid-19, but there is a huge talent pool available to France.</p>

<p>In fact, there is an incredible starting XI that could be formed from the players who have been left out of Deschamps' latest squad, including multiple stars that would easily walk into several other countries' first-team plans.</p>

<p>Captain Hugo Lloris, Marseille's Steve Mandanda and Lille's Mike Maignan have been called up as the three goalkeepers, leaving Paris Saint-Germain shot-stopper Alphonse Areola at home. The 27-year-old has had to play second fiddle to Keylor Navas at the Parc des Princes but is still more than capable between the sticks.</p>

<p>Just two years ago Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard struck the sweetest of half-volleys as France overcame Argentina 4-3 at the last-16 stage of the World Cup but he has not made the cut this time around.</p>

<p>France are blessed with assured defenders, including Real Madrid's Raphael Varane and PSG centre back Presnel Kimpembe but there is currently no place for the man who scored the goal to take them to the World Cup final. Although Barcelona's Samuel Umtiti has suffered with injury problems of late. </p>

<p>Nabil Fekir, who was close to joining Liverpool in 2018 before deal fell through, is not in squad</p>

<p>Former Arsenal target Thomas Lemar has appeared to have lost his way since 2018 World Cup</p>

<p>Therefore there is greater shock at the omission of Manchester City's top centre half Aymeric Laporte, who at 26 is still yet to earn a senior international cap for his country. The defender is, arguably, Pep Guardiola's best, exuding calm and composure on the ball. Laporte's club team-mate Benjamin Mendy joins him in missing out this time. </p>

<p>As well as a strong back four the unused players who can make up the midfield and forward options are frightening. </p>

<p>Bayern's Champions League hero Kingsley Coman does not feature in the 23-man squad and neither does the pacey winger's club team-mate Corentin Tolisso. Their 2019-20 campaigns did only finish on August 23 but both boast more than 20 international caps each.</p>

<p>There is no room for two forward-thinking players who have been frequently linked with moves to the Premier League. Now at Real Betis, Nabil Fekir was close to joining Liverpool back in 2018 before the deal fell through, but the 27-year-old lit up LaLiga in his debut season.</p>

<p>Bayern Munich's Champions League hero Kingsley Coman does not feature in 23-man squad</p>

<p>Real Madrid's star striker Karim Benzema has been exiled from the national team for years</p>

<p>Goalkeepers: Hugo Lloris, Steve Mandanda and Mike Maignan </p>

<p>Defenders: Lucas Hernandez, Leo Dubois, Presnel Kimpembe, Clement Lenglet, Dayot Upamecano, Raphael Varane, Lucas Digne and Ferland Mendy</p>

<p>Midfielders: Moussa Sissoko, Houssem Aouar, Steven Nzonzi, Eduardo Camavinga, Adrien Rabiot and N'Golo Kante</p>

<p>Forwards:  Olivier Giroud, Wissam Ben Yedder, Kylian Mbappe, Anthony Martial, Antoine Griezmann and Jonathan Ikone</p>

<p>The hugely talented midfield can be completed with a former Arsenal transfer target, who has struggled for form, not registering an assist or goal in the 2019-20 season for Atletico Madrid.</p>

<p>Thomas Lemar was part of the World Cup-winning side in 2018 but appears to have lost his way but there is no denying he has ability.</p>

<p>In attack Deschamps has chosen Chelsea's Olivier Giroud, Monaco's Wissam Ben Yedder, PSG's Mbappe, United's Anthony Martial, Barcelona's Griezmann and Lille's Jonathan Ikone.</p>

<p>A plethora of lethal options but there are two significant performers that have been overlooked. Arsenal forward Alexandre Lacazette, who has earned 16 caps, is a potent finisher while Real Madrid's Karim Benzema had a season to remember.</p>

<p>He became the club's fifth all-time top goalscorer as the 32-year-old fired the LaLiga giants to the Spanish title. However Benzema has been exiled from the national team for more than four years following a sex-tape scandal.</p>

<p>The work for the Euros begins now and with an embarrassment of riches France look well placed to add to their World Cup success and to be the country to beat.</p>

<p>The incredible France team made up of the stars left out of Didier Deschamps' latest squad</p>
