<p>Autumnal style: Carey Mulligan cut a casual figure in a dark green coat and straight leg trousers as she grabbed lunch with friends at The Wolseley in central London on Wednesday</p>

<p>The screen star paired her tailored wrap coat with a high-neck top, Gucci trainers and a black satchel that draped over her shoulder. </p>

<p>Carey opted for a minimal make-up look and protected her delicate features with edgy circular shades. </p>

<p>The blonde beauty tucked her tresses in a turquoise hair tie and she added a delicate touch with gold pendant earrings. </p>

<p>She clutched a Soho Hotel bag in her hand, exposing her glistening wedding and engagement ring as she spoke to the taxi driver.    </p>

<p>Ready to go: The actress, 35, embraced the colder temperatures with her effortlessly stylish outfit as she called for a taxi outside the upmarket restaurant</p>

<p>The actress has kept a relatively low profile during the coronavirus pandemic but was seen out and about in Los Angeles in August, catching up with pals and running errands.   </p>

<p>The star recently opened up to NET-A-PORTER's digital publication, PORTER, in which she discussed her thoughts on the #MeToo movement, life after children and toxic masculinity in her new film Promising Young Woman. </p>

<p>The award-winning actress, who shares Evelyn, four, and Wilfred, two, with musician husband Marcus Mumford, 33, also insisted she's content with juggling her career with motherhood, sharing: 'I haven't been in a bar in ages, and I’m very glad of that'.  </p>

<p>Stylish: The screen star paired her tailored wrap coat with a high-neck top, Gucci trainers and a black satchel that draped over her shoulder</p>

<p>Eye candy: Carey opted for a minimal make-up look and protected her delicate features with edgy circular shades</p>

<p>Solo outing: The British actress chatted to pals outside the venue but her musician partner, Marcus Mumford was not present for the social lunch</p>

<p>Shining bright: She clutched a Soho Hotel bag in her hand, exposing her glistening wedding ring as she spoke to the taxi driver</p>

<p>Carey has also been promoting her new movie, Promising Young Woman, which follows the story of her character Cassie, a barista who feels unfulfilled in her life. </p>

<p>In a bid to lift her spirits, the medical school dropout lets loose at bars every week, where she becomes intoxicated and on the brink of passing out.  </p>

<p>During one raucous outing, men who pretend to 'help' her, end up attempting to take advantage of her drunken state.  </p>

<p>The thespian claimed her project, penned and directed by Killing Eve showrunner, Emerald Fennell, highlights the importance of awareness surrounding topics such as sexual assault and toxic masculinity.  </p>

<p>The British actress said: 'It’s funny, because the reaction I first had when I read the script was, "This is soooo romantic".</p>

<p>'[But] Emerald’s [point] was: if [you] take someone home and they are really drunk, and then that person reveals they are not drunk, and you feel guilty, then you know what you are doing isn’t right.'</p>

<p>'What we reflected on, making this film, was the amount of real-life stories like this we know. A lot of this film is stuff that pretty much every woman I know has experienced in some way. '</p>

<p>When asked whether she misses her life before welcoming her kids, the mother-of-two, who wed musician Marcus in April 2012, declared: 'Noooo. </p>

<p>'In fact, every time we stepped into a new bar set, Emerald and I would both be like, "God, we haven’t been in a bar in a really long time". And I’m very glad of that.' </p>

<p>Family first: The thespian shares children Evelyn, four, and Wilfred, two, with husband Marcus, 33, who is the frontman of British Indie band, Mumford &amp; Sons (pictured in May 2012)</p>
