<p>Joe went on to say he feels frustrated we have to take a step back after moving forward and is 'sensitive about other people knowing small businesses and restaurants that are going to go under'. </p>

<p>'When I start thinking about that, that energy it brings me down so much,' Joe continued. </p>
