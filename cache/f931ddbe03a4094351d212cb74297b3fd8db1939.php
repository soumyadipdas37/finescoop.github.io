<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dr Andrew Rochford is being touted as a likely candidate to anchor a new-look Studio 10 alongside Sarah Harris.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, the 41-year-old TV presenter addressed the speculation during an interview with Nova 96.9's Fitzy &amp; Wippa.</p>

<p>Radio host Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli tried to catch out Andrew by congratulating him on the new job, even though Channel 10 hasn't publicly confirmed anything yet. </p>

<p>'My name is thrown around for a lot of things': Dr Andrew Rochford told Fitzy &amp; Wippa on Tuesday he would 'love to' host Studio 10</p>

<p>Andrew stayed coy, prompting co-host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald to say: 'Your name has been thrown around...' </p>

<p>'My name is thrown around for a lot of things,' Andrew interrupted. 'But usually they don't end up in the headlines!'</p>

<p>'Would you do it, Roch?' Wippa then asked. </p>

<p>'My goodness, I'd love to do it. Just give me a chance,' the doctor replied breezily, before rattling off a list of shows he'd also love to host.</p>

<p>Following a round of job cuts last month, Studio 10 will be switching from a panel format to a two-person format, like Channel Seven's The Morning Show.</p>

<p>TV Blackbox reported on August 17 that Andrew was 'the most likely person' to assume the role of male anchor alongside Sarah Harris.</p>

<p>The industry website noted that he had been featured on Studio 10 several times in recent weeks and was considered a safe and uncontroversial choice.</p>

<p>The doctor, who made his TV debut as a contestant on Nine's The Block in 2004, joined The Project in 2010 as a panellist. </p>

<p>He was later promoted to fill-in host after the departure of Charlie Pickering.</p>

<p>Experience: The doctor, who made his TV debut as a contestant on Nine's The Block in 2004, joined The Project in 2010 as a panellist. In 2018, he hosted Channel 10 game show Pointless, which was cancelled the following year</p>

<p>Axed: Last month, Channel 10 announced that 25 of its stars were being sacked as part of a cost-cutting measure, including newsreader Natarsha Belling (left) and legendary weatherman Tim Bailey (right)</p>

<p>In 2014, he was hired by 7News as a medical reporter, but returned to Channel 10 in 2018 to host the game show Pointless, which was cancelled the following year. </p>

<p>Channel 10 announced last month that 25 of its stars were being sacked as part of a cost-cutting measure.</p>

<p>Studio 10 has been hit particularly hard, with outspoken panellist Kerri-Anne Kennerley and newsreader Natarsha Belling being made redundant.</p>

<p>Let go: Australian TV legend and Studio 10 host Kerri-Anne Kennerley was also among the 25 stars axed by the network </p>
