<p>'I tried to play it off as no big deal,' he said. 'I told her that I had to go to the hospital for something minor.'</p>

<p>The country icon said that 'Shirley wasn’t buying that for one simple reason,' as 'the bill said the charges were for the birth of a baby girl, Paula Carlene, born to a Mrs. Connie Nelson.'</p>

<p>Nelson said that he 'was caught flat-footed' and 'couldn’t lie' to Collie when she pressed him on the identity of Connie Nelson (who was his girlfriend Connie Kopek).</p>

<p>He wrote: 'Had to get the words out of my mouth: "Connie’s my girlfriend and Paula’s our daughter."'</p>

<p>Nelson went on to split with Collie in 1971 and married Kopek, though he 'still hadn’t reformed' when it came to his roving eye.</p>

<p>'I messed up another marriage,' he said. 'My wandering ways were too much for any woman to put up with.'</p>

<p>He said he eventually found his true love with Annie Marie D’Angelo, who he met when she was working as a makeup artist on his 1986 TV film Stagecoach.</p>

<p>Celebration: Nelson in April celebrated 4/20 with Come and Toke It, a benefit concert with proceeds aimed at Last Prisoner Project, a marijuana legalization group </p>

<p>He hosted the streaming musical event with his son Lukas</p>

<p>'My love for Annie was all-consuming, but winning her over wasn’t easy. She had to be sure my marriage was over and that I was truly free,' he said. 'You’ve already seen that when it comes to romance, I had a gift for complicating things. But marrying Annie wasn’t complicated at all.</p>

<p>It’s about the smartest thing I ever did ... thirty-four years after we first met, we’re still together and going strong.'</p>

<p>Nelson, who co-wrote with book with his sister and bandmate Bobbie, who has been married four times, is father to seven kids. </p>
