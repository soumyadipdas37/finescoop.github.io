<p>Models Olivia Evi Plant, 18, and Gina Vuletich, 30, are represented by Market Vogue - a Sydney-based creative digital agency for influencing, modelling, and casting.</p>

<p>The blonde-bombshells have thousands of followers each on their Instagram profiles but have completely different stories of success. </p>

<p>Ms Plant's social media career began when she was still in high school, with the Gold Coast local earning almost $30,000 in Year 12 last year - while Ms Vuletich balanced her growing online profile with full time work.  </p>

<p>Gina Vuletich (pictured), 30, balanced her growing Instagram profile with full time work</p>

<p>But Ms Plant's hard work almost went down the drain when her Instagram account - which had more than 100,000 followers - was deleted for violating community guidelines.  </p>

<p>'Six years of hard work was gone. I had over 100k followers and one day I was just scrolling on Instagram and it said I got logged out,' she said.</p>

<p>'I tried logging back in and they said I violated the guidelines even though I didn't do anything wrong.'</p>

<p>The 18-year-old is currently rebuilding her Instagram platform and has about 9,000 followers.</p>

<p>Ms Plant said she would make a few thousand dollars for her Instagram posts.</p>

<p>'Every person is different. Like definitely with people with over 500k on Instagram get like 15k per post, up to 20k,' she said. </p>

<p>'It really depends on how many followers you have or how good your engagement is.' </p>

<p>Ms Vuletich, who has Croatian heritage, built her social media presence on the side while working full time</p>

<p>Despite the bad luck, the teenager hsa found success on video-sharing app TikTok after a dancing video with her mum went viral. </p>

<p>The snippet was viewed 40 million times and gathered more than two million likes.</p>

<p>'There was one viral video that blew up overnight and I kept trying make videos like that and they all just kept blowing up I didn't really know what was going on but it was cool,' she said.</p>

<p>She now has 1.3million followers on TikTok. </p>

<p>Ms Vuletich, who has Croatian heritage, built her social media presence on the side while working full time. </p>

<p>She moved to Australia from New Zealand nine years ago and began influencing in 2015.</p>

<p>'Started out getting free products, fake tan, skin care. Then as I grew bigger and bigger that's when I started putting a price tag on things,' she said. </p>

<p>The 30-year-old said modelling is a great way to get your foot in the door as an Instagram influencer.   </p>

<p>'I had my full-time job. I was an Executive assistant at the time, and I was probably modelling once a week,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was doing handbags seasonal, clothing, beauty you name it.' </p>

<p>Ms Vuletich said she began to charge about $100 per Instagram post when she had between 8,000 and 10,000 followers. </p>

<p>'They would say ''send us your offer and tell us how you'd promote our brand'',' Ms Vuletich said. </p>

<p>'So I would say ''hey guys this skin care brand suits me as I love organic etc, I would love to showcase your product like this, and I would like to be paid $120 for one story and a post''.' </p>

<p>Ms Vuletich said it took her five to six years to build her profile, describing it as a 'slow burn'. </p>

<p>'Because I was working full time as a Finance Executive,' she explained. </p>

<p>'I'm career focused so trying to focus on that as well as the social side of things can be full on. </p>

<p>Ms Vuletich moved to Australia from New Zealand nine years ago and began influencing in 2015</p>

<p>'Some girls do like five to six posts per week where mine was two to three. And I think that has an effect.' </p>

<p>Ms Vuletich said she makes about $30,000 a year from her side hustle.   </p>

<p>'Every six weeks I get $500 worth of hair from a sponsor which is my colour, cut, and toner,' she said. </p>

<p>Market Vogue was founded in Sydney by James Boyd</p>

<p>'And then my extensions on top of that, and that's another $600 every six weeks so that's $1,100 almost every month for free on my hair alone. </p>

<p>The influencer is now charging between $250 and $350 per post.</p>

<p>Both women heaped praise on their representation, Market Vogue, claiming the agency makes it easier to find work.</p>

<p>Ms Vuletich said she was initially worried about the agency taking a bigger cut of her earnings but she quickly realised how many extra job opportunities she received. </p>

<p>'I would have never had that opportunity before,' she said, adding the agency is 'actively going out there looking for work for me'. </p>

<p>'I'm too busy to do that, I have a full time job. I wouldn't have time to get that work.'</p>

<p>Market Vogue was founded in Sydney by James Boyd.</p>

<p>Mr Boyd said influencer marketing continued to prove successful for businesses because influeners have 'genuine relationships' with their audience and become trusted.  </p>

<p>For those looking to break into influencing, Mr Boyd said it is important to be 'consistent' and 'patient'. </p>

<p>'Nothing happens overnight,' he said.</p>

<p>'There is no secret to success on social media and there are no short cuts. </p>

<p>'It has taken a few years for some our models to grow their accounts.'</p>

<p>Mr Boyd also spoke about the power of TikTok and its popularity with Generation Z.</p>

<p>'If TikTok isn't in your play book for advertising this year, I would recommend reviewing the numbers and consider how popular the app is,' he said. </p>
