<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A commercial manager working on the Grenfell Tower refurbishment was promised a 'very nice meal' by the cladding supplier after securing a deal to use the flammable product on the tower, the inquiry into the blaze has heard.</p>

<p>Mark Harris, who worked in sales for Harley Facades, agreed he had a 'close relationship' with cladding manufacturer Alcoa, now Arconic, and supplier CEP, but denied there were any 'incentives' to use Reynobond aluminium composite material (ACM) panels in the tower block's revamp.</p>

<p>In an email exchange in June 2014 between Deborah French of Alcoa and Geoff Blades of CEP, Mr Harris is thanked by Mr Blades for his business.</p>

<p>Mr Blades writes: 'Mark, all I can say is that you'll be taken out for a very nice meal very soon somewhere very nice.'</p>

<p>Mr Harris told the inquiry on Thursday: 'Debbie had been really good, proactive in providing information.</p>

<p>'You build up that relationship with somebody and you start to trust them so she'd been very good for us.'</p>

<p>Inquiry lawyer Richard Millett QC asked: 'Were any incentives provided for you to use Alcoa and their Reynobond product over any other product made by other manufacturers?'</p>

<p>Mr Harris said: 'No.'</p>

<p>There was no written formal contract between external wall specialist Harley and main design and build contractor Rydon, but a scope of works was agreed for the job in July 2014 for a figure of around £2.6 million, the inquiry has heard.</p>

<p>Asked if Harley was 'influential' in choosing Reynobond for the project, Mr Harris said: 'No. I think we were part of a process ... If the specification for zinc had held then the contract value would have been much higher.</p>

<p>'There's no interest to Harley in having a much lesser contract value, it was the client budget that drove it away from that so we were just being helpful.'</p>

<p>The inquiry has heard that Rydon submitted a £9.2 million quote to complete the Grenfell Tower revamp, but the client, the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (TMO), then told Rydon it needed to save a further £800,000 on the project, resulting in a process of 'value engineering' to get the job done at a cheaper cost.</p>

<p>The tragedy claimed 72 lives (pictured) due to a devastating fire on June 14 2017, but survivors from the tower block blaze are not allowed to attend the inquiry due to social distancing rules</p>

<p>In addition, Rydon had made a pricing error in its submission, requiring it to find another £212,000, which it sought to do by passing altered cladding figures to the TMO in order to take 'some of the savings for themselves' and cover the error, the inquiry has heard.</p>

<p>The ACM Reynobond PE panels used in Grenfell's cladding system had a heat combustion akin to diesel and close to lighter fluid, and possessed a high-calorific value compared with other construction materials, the hearing has been told.</p>

<p>They were found to have fuelled the fire's rapid spread at the 24-storey west London block in June 2017, in which 72 people died.</p>

<p>It was sparked by an electrical fault in a fridge-freezer.</p>
