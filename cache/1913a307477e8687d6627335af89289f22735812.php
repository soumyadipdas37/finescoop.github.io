<p>The Attorney General in the US Virgin Islands, where the billionaire had a home and is said to have carried out many of his horrific crimes, has demanded to see the logs which document the passengers on his aircraft.</p>

<p>The logs on his four helicopters and three planes span from 1998 until his suicide in prison last year.</p>

<p>Jeffrey Epstein's flight logs on his aircraft, including his 'Lolita Express' jet, have been subpoenaed, sparking fear among the rich and famous who partied with the pedophile</p>

<p>Attorney General Denise George has filed a lawsuit against his estate alleging 22 accounts including human trafficking, aggravated rape, child abuse, neglect, forced labour and prostitution, The Mirror reported.  </p>

<p>Ms George is also requesting to see any 'complaints or reports of potentially suspicious conduct' as well as personal notes made by the pilots. </p>

<p>The subpoena demands the names and details of anyone who worked for the pilots, interacted with Epstein and passengers who travelled with him.</p>

<p>Pilot David Rodgers has previously revealed logs from 2009 which showed Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Naomi Campbell were among those who flew on his jet.</p>

<p>It is not suggested they were aware of any wrongdoing by Epstein. </p>

<p>A source said: 'The records that have been subpoenaed will make the ones Rodgers provided look like a Post-It note.</p>

<p>'There is panic among many of the rich and famous.'</p>

<p>Lawyers for the victims said the logs released in 2009 did not include the flights of chief pilot Larry Visoki who had flown Epstein for more than 25 years.  </p>

<p>It comes as a celebrity chef has been quizzed by detectives 20 years after he worked for Epstein - prompting renewed calls for Prince Andrew to speak to the FBI.</p>

<p>Adam Perry Lang, 51, opened the Barbecoa restaurant with Jamie Oliver in London in 2010 - and worked for Jeffrey Epstein between 1999 and 2003.</p>

<p>He is now 'fully cooperating' with the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by depraved billionaire Epstein, reported the Daily Mirror.</p>

<p>Attorney Arick Fudali, representing the victims, heaped pressure on Prince Andrew - who has been accused of stonewalling detectives.</p>

<p>Mr Fudali said: 'We certainly hope that this may inspire other witnesses to come forward and help shed some light on Epstein's dark scheme.' </p>

<p>American Mr Perry Lang catered for the Duke of York, 60, and flew with him in a private jet on two occasions - once in February 1999 and in May 2000.</p>

<p>Sources told the newspaper: 'Perry Lang holds information on what took place. They will get as much detail as possible that will shape any interview they may one day have with the duke.' </p>

<p>Mr Perry Lang, who has been described as a decent man by victims, came forward after Virginia Giuffre, 37, wrote to ask him to be the 'hero'.</p>

<p>His lawyer Lawrence Lustberg confirmed the chef was helping the FBI. Mr Perry Lang himself added: 'We have absolutely always been available to the attorneys representing the victims.'</p>

<p>He previously denied being aware of any 'depraved behaviour' during his four-year term as Epstein's chef.</p>

<p>Epstein, 66, killed himself while awaiting trial in a cell for underage sex trafficking last year.  </p>

<p>Last month, Virginia Giuffre claimed Prince Andrew played a 'guessing game,' with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell about her age before comparing her to his daughters.</p>

<p>Mr Perry Lang (pictured in 2016) is now 'fully cooperating' with the FBI investigation into allegations of sexual abuse by depraved billionaire Epstein</p>

<p>The accuser spoke out in a documentary series, Surviving Jeffrey Epstein, claiming she met the royal in London, describing him as an 'abuser,' and 'not the prince from the fairy tale stories you read'.</p>

<p>Ms Giuffre, who says she was trafficked by paedophile financier Epstein, alleges the duke had sex with her on three separate occasions, including when she was 17, still a minor under US law.</p>

<p>Andrew has categorically denied he has had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Giuffre.</p>

<p>Maxwell is awaiting trial in the US after being charged with procuring teenage girls for Epstein to abuse. She denies this. </p>

<p>Earlier this year Prince Andrew said he was 'angry and bewildered' as he denied reports he was contacted about the Jeffrey Epstein investigation. </p>

<p>He said he would be 'more than happy to talk'.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Prince Andrew for comment.</p>
