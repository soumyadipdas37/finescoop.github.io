<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Struggling Aviva is selling its Singapore arm for £1.6billion as new boss Amanda Blanc fights to turn the company around. </p>

<p>The insurance group will be bought by a consortium led by Singapore Life, with private equity firm TPG becoming its largest shareholder. </p>

<p>Blanc, 53, is trying to refocus Aviva on more profitable divisions such as Britain, Ireland and Canada since she took over in July. </p>

<p>Sell-off: The insurance group will be bought by a consortium led by Singapore Life</p>

<p>She said: 'The sale of Aviva Singapore is a significant first step in our new strategy to bring greater focus to Aviva's portfolio.' </p>

<p>The sale of the Singapore business was abandoned by her predecessor Maurice Tulloch amid speculation that he could not secure a good enough price for it. </p>

<p>Analysts predict that Aviva will follow this up with the sale of other businesses in Turkey, China, Italy and Poland. </p>

<p>Barrie Cornes, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said: 'Full marks to Amanda Blanc, this is a good deal. </p>

<p>'We think her strategy is to move at pace and we think the likes of Europe and Asia will be disposed of. So this is very much a first step to concentrate the business into its much more profitable areas.' </p>
