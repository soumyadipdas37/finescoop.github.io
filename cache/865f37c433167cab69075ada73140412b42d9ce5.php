<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Karen Matthews' best friend has said the lifelong anonymity order for the kidnapper's daughter Shannon 'will help her step out of her mother's shadow'.</p>

<p>Julie Bushby, whose evidence helped convict Karen, said 'those kids need to try and have a normal life', 12 years after the staged disappearance.</p>

<p>Shannon was the victim in the faked kidnapping by 'Britain's worst mother' Karen, who had plotted to pocket a £50,000 reward.</p>

<p>The missing schoolgirl had been drugged, tied up and hidden in the base of a divan bed in West Yorkshire - before being found 24 days after she disappeared.</p>

<p>Karen and her then boyfriend Michael Donovan were found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.</p>

<p>Shannon and her siblings will have lifelong anonymity after the High Court granted an 'extraordinary' injunction on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The sweeping order prevents their new names, addresses and jobs from ever being revealed or published unless a court agrees, court documents show.</p>

<p>The missing schoolgirl (pictured) had been drugged, tied up and hidden in the base of a divan bed in West Yorkshire - before being found 24 days after she disappeared</p>

<p>Ms Bushby, from Dewsbury Moor, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, told the Mirror: 'It's about time. Those kids need to try and have a normal life.</p>

<p>'It is 12 years ago now. Why should they pay for their mother's crimes? I'm sure this will be a great relief to them all.</p>

<p>'Every time they see a picture of their mum they have to relive their ordeal. That must be terrible.'</p>

<p>February 19, 2008: Shannon Matthews is last seen outside her school in Dewsbury</p>

<p>February 20, 2008: Police announce a massive search for the missing girl</p>

<p>February 21, 2008: volunteers join the local police search party</p>

<p>March 1, 2008: Shannon's mother Karen issues an emotional public appeal for the safe return on her daughter</p>

<p>March 12, 2008: Reward offered for information leading to Shannon's whereabouts is increased to £50,000</p>

<p>March 14, 2008: Shannon is found inside the base of a divan base at the home of Michael Donovan in Batley Carr </p>

<p>Over the next few weeks Donovan, along with Shannon's mother and stepfather, are all charged for separate offences</p>

<p>January 23, 2009 Matthews and Donovan are sentenced to eight years each of kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice</p>

<p>The security worker, played by Sheridan Smith in BBC1's The Moorside in 2017, added: 'Now they can live their lives for themselves instead of being in their mother's shadow.'</p>

<p>Ms Bushby, who was Karen's neighbour, was in the police car when the shamed mother admitted that she knew what had happened to her daughter.</p>

<p>The former chairman of the residents association was praised by the judge at Karen's trial for her honesty when she gave evidence.</p>

<p>Shannon, who will soon turn 22, and her siblings were protected by a reporting restriction order due to expire next year.</p>

<p>Sources told the Sun all of the siblings, including Shannon, have been left deeply affected by the traumatic events of 2008.</p>

<p>It is understood they have legally changed their names after they were taken into care, and the lifelong order will only be changed if the family revoke it.</p>

<p>Nine-year-old Shannon was kidnapped by Matthews and Donovan, who planned to generate money from the publicity.</p>

<p>They plotted for Donovan to release Shannon at Dewsbury Market, 'discover her', and then take her to a police station and claim a £50,000 reward. </p>

<p>West Yorkshire Police found Shannon alive at 12.30pm on March 14, 2008, 24 days after she went missing.</p>

<p>She was concealed in the base of a divan bed at a flat in Lidgate Gardens and Donovan was arrested at the scene.</p>

<p>In November 2008, Leeds Crown Court heard evidence Shannon had been drugged to subdue her whilst she was held.</p>

<p>Donovan claimed Matthews had asked him to look after her daughter for several days and they would make money from newspaper rewards.</p>

<p>He told the court she had threatened him with violence.</p>

<p>On November 27, Matthews denied having anything to do with her daughter's disappearance and had been told to 'take the blame' for what had happened.</p>

<p>In cross-examination, Julian Goose QC said that she had told police a total of five versions of the story and accused her of 'telling lie after lie, after lie'.</p>

<p>On December 4, Matthews and Donovan were found guilty of kidnapping, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice.</p>
