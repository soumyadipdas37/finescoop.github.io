<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has questioned whether Memphis Depay would succeed at Barcelona after coaching him at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>The Lyon striker has reportedly agreed personal terms with the LaLiga giants and negotiations over a fee are now taking place between the two clubs. </p>

<p>But Van Gaal, who signed Depay for £25million back in 2015, is concerned that the 26-year-old may struggle to adapt to the 'new culture' and 'new team'.  </p>

<p>Louis van Gaal questioned whether Memphis Depay (above) would succeed at Barcelona</p>

<p>When asked if the former Manchester United No.7 flop could succeed at Barca, Van Gaal told Tutto Mercato: 'There's always a question mark. Depay is an interesting player, especially when he's free to play.</p>

<p>'But we have to consider adapting to a new culture and a new team. And the first year is always the hardest.</p>

<p>'Look at [Matthijs] De Ligt, or Frenkie de Jong.</p>

<p>'Depay has talent, but he's not [Lionel] Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.'</p>

<p>Depay started only 16 Premier League games in a season-and-a-half at United under Louis van Gaal and Jose Mourinho, scoring just twice.</p>

<p>The rigid playing systems deployed by both his managers didn't help the Dutch international to express his attacking instincts out wide or down the middle </p>

<p>Van Gaal, who signed Depay for £25m back in 2015, is concerned he will struggle to adapt</p>

<p>The Lyon striker has reportedly agreed personal terms with Ronald Koeman's La Liga side</p>

<p>Depay shared his frustrations with Van Gaal in his autobiography, saying: 'At United I got confused. I had to follow the tactical orders of Van Gaal, otherwise I would certainly lose my spot in the team. </p>

<p>'Van Gaal doesn't like players who don't follow up on his comments.</p>

<p>'Meanwhile I knew I couldn't get the best out of my play this way: staying on the left side of the field, running back and forth.</p>

<p>'I didn't understand: you buy me because of my specific qualities you saw at PSV and the Dutch national team. After that you put me in a role where I can't play that way anymore. For me that was confusing.'</p>

<p>Depay's career did, however, pick up when he joined Lyon in 2017 for £15m. Since then, he helped the French side reach the Champions League semi-final - defeating Juventus and Manchester City. </p>

<p>During his time at the club he has scored 57 goals in 132 games - with 11 of those being in the Champions League. </p>

<p>Depay will be looking to continue such for if joins Barcelona this summer.  </p>
