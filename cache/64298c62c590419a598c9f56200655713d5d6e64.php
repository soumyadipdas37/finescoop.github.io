<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Beauty advent calendars have grown in popularity in recent years with many brands now offering swoon-worthy Christmas countdowns.</p>

<p>And today John Lewis has released details of its eagerly awaited beauty advent calendar for 2020 - and it doesn't disappoint.</p>

<p>Launching October 6, this year's calendar retails for £150 and contains over £375 worth of the most sought-after products from John Lewis' beauty department.</p>

<p>Whether you want to treat a loved one or simply spoil yourself, John Lewis' beauty advent calendar for 2020 doesn't disappoint </p>

<p>The retailer's offering is certainly generous, as this year's beauty advent calendar includes 25 premium must-haves, including eight full-sized products from the nation's favourite beauty brands and three fragrances. It's a great opportunity to discover new products and indulge in iconic classics.</p>

<p>Last year's advent from John Lewis was a sell-out, and since 2020's offering is bursting with big names it's sure to sell out swiftly too. If you're a My John Lewis member, you can be the first to shop the calendar on October 1 before it goes on general sale on October 6.</p>

<p>So we recommend signing up ASAP because who doesn't love a chic beauty advent calendar full of skincare and makeup must-haves?</p>

<p>Sustainability has been front of mind when designing this year's calendar, and the carefully curated selection is housed in a fully recyclable box with reversible drawers for those that want reuse and fill up next year.</p>

<p>While we don't want to spoil all the surprises, there a few favourites hiding inside that we couldn't help but share. Keep an eye out for bestsellers from Sunday Riley, Shiseido, Charlotte Tilbury, Disciple, Slip, Elemis and Nars, to name but a few.</p>

<p>For those who want a sneak peek inside, here's a full list.</p>
