<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Melburnians have blasted John Farnham songs from their front yards in an extraordinary 'mini' anti-lockdown protest.</p>

<p>Several hundred residents gathered in the CBD on Saturday to illegally protest against the city strict stage four lockdown, which sparked clashes with police.</p>

<p>But locals in a suburban street opted to protest legally from their own homes later that night which didn't involve breaching the strict night curfew or risking a $1652 fine.</p>

<p>One young woman uploaded a TikTok video of a note put in her letterbox on Saturday inviting the neighbourhood to take part in street protest at 8pm that night.</p>

<p>This Melbourne woman was among the 'legal' anti-lockdown protesters on Saturday night</p>

<p>'Want to express you frustration? Don't want to get a fine?' the letter starts.</p>

<p>'Neither do we.  </p>

<p>'At 8pm, we will standing in a front yard and playing three John Farnham tunes on full noise. </p>

<p>'Please join us from your front yard to belt them out.'   </p>

<p>The author selected That's Freedom, Chain Reaction and You're the Voice as the Farnsy classics to be played.</p>

<p>'I f*****ng love my neighbourhood,' the woman says in the video. </p>

<p>Residents in a Melbourne neighbouhood received this invitation in their letterbox on Saturday</p>

<p>This Melbourne woman embraced the idea of a mini anti-lockdown protest in her street</p>

<p>The woman posted a second clip clarifying why she thought the neighbourhood protest was a great idea after her original video went viral online and was inundated with comments.</p>

<p>'We're all going through so many emotions at this time as lockdown is really frustarting,' she said</p>

<p>'But instead of being idiot and going to the city, I think it's a good idea to be a community andexpress how you feel in the right way.' </p>

<p>'I didn't expect it to blow up the way it did but it did.' </p>

<p>Hours later, the woman was back getting ready to livestream the street protest.  </p>

<p>Residents were seen standing in their front yards on Saturday night blasting Farnsy classics</p>

<p>'I'll be disappointed if this thing doesn't turn out good,' she says while enjoying a drink.</p>

<p>'I'm trying to get excited.'</p>

<p>But right on time as promised, the darkened street came to life where several neighbours can be seen standing in their driveways blasting Farnham's hit Chain Reaction.</p>

<p>'This is the turn out guys, It's not that bad,' the woman says.</p>

<p>'There's a few others down the street playing it too.'</p>

<p>Police issued more than 160 fines at Saturday's earlier protest to those breaching lockdown measures or not wearing a mask. </p>

<p>Metropolitan Melbourne and the Mitchell Shire are subject to stage four restrictions including an evening curfew and a ban on travelling beyond a five-kilometre radius of home.</p>

<p>Australian's second largest city will remain in stage four lockdown until at least September 28 after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews extended it by two weeks on Sunday. </p>

<p>Regional Victoria remains under stage three restrictions which allows residents to leave home for essential purposes.</p>

<p>Premier Andrews has also released road map out of lockdown as Victoria recorded 41 new cases and five deaths on Monday.</p>
