<p>Cringe: Things got off to a rocky start for Locky Gilbert as he stumbled over his words following an interrogation by Izzy Sharman-Firth's mum during his hometown visits on The Bachelor</p>

<p>When asked what he thought about feminism, there was a long silence before Locky told cameras: 'I'm on The Bachelor, some people might think that I'm not the best guy to talk about feminism.'</p>

<p>After regaining his composure, Locky finally answered: 'Well, I guess I don't want to do the classic family stuff when the guy goes out to work, and the girl stays home.</p>

<p>'I want to be able to work together, and then go travelling together, and just we're always together.'</p>

<p>Despite eventually answering the questions by Izzy's mother, fans were not amused as they criticised his slow and hesitant response.</p>

<p>Awkward: When asked what he thought about feminism by Izzy's mum, there was a long silence before before he told cameras: 'Some people might think that I'm not the best guy to talk about feminism'</p>

<p>After regaining his composure, Locky finally answered: 'Well, I guess I don't want to do the classic family stuff when the guy goes out to work, and the girl stays home'</p>

<p>Locky added: 'I want to be able to work together, and then go travelling together, and just we're always together'</p>

<p>One fumed: 'Men, the correct answer to “how do you feel about feminism” is “I’m completely supportive”. It’s not difficult or controversial. #TheBachelorAU.'</p>

<p>Another echoed: Sorry, but why is feminism a hard question? I may be wrong, but to me I think it says a lot about him that he thinks feminism and being on #thebachelorau can’t be conducive?.'</p>

<p>Someone else added: 'No Locky, feminism isn’t a hard thing, it’s either you support gender equality and all the comes with it or you don’t #TheBachelorAU.'</p>

<p>Another enraged viewers gave their input: 'How hard is it for a straight man to just say “yes I believe in equality” when asked “what do you think about feminism”? #TheBachelorAU.'</p>

<p>'Does he know what feminism means?' Viewers were left cringing as Locky struggled to convey an enlightening and educational response when asked what his views on feminism were.</p>

<p>Someone else asked: 'Do we think Locky actually knows what feminism is #TheBachelorAU.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Locky was also asked by Izzy's mother what his views on monogamy were. </p>

<p>Having finally found his stride, Locky responded: 'Marriage to me is very important, as long as we're in love with each other and the feelings are there, that's all I need.'</p>

<p>The adventure junkie also added that he wanted children, much to the delight of Izzy's family.   </p>
