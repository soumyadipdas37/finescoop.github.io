<p>The fight will mark a sensational return to combat sports for McGregor, who had announced his retirement from the UFC back in June.</p>

<p>His trainer Kavanagh confirmed that talks are underway and he is very confident a deal will be struck for the two superstars to meet in 2021.</p>

<p>'It's in the works. Both boxers have agreed fundamentally,' Kavanagh told Boxing Productions TV as per Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'Behind the scenes there are a lot of terms and conditions, legal teams and managers that have to work out fine details.</p>

<p>'I believe it will happen. When? I'm not sure. I think it might be early next year. The wheels are in motion.</p>

<p>'It looks like I'll be coaching boxing again.'</p>

<p>McGregor posted footage on his social media of his shadow boxing in a ring last week</p>

<p>McGregor has always spoken of his desire to switch codes and try his hand at boxing again after being beaten by Floyd Mayweather in their money-spinning crossover fight back in 2017.</p>

<p>The Notorious One, who had teased a return to boxing earlier last week by posting several clips of him training on social media, admitted he regrets not fighting dirty against Mayweather.</p>

<p>Reflecting on his super fight with the legendary boxer, McGregor wrote on Instagram: 'I’m upset I fully followed the rules for that fight to be honest. Floyd deserved a volley at the least. A shoulder even, break the face.</p>

<p>'Manny not so much though I don’t think, but I will see how the build up goes and wait to hear what bitter old Freddie Roach has to say and then make a decision. My Whiskeys at half a billion and climbing so I could take a fine.'  </p>

<p>McGregor said he regrets not breaking the rules in his fight with Floyd Mayweather in 2017</p>

<p>Boxing coach Freddie Roach (above) believes Pacquiao will knock out McGregor easily</p>

<p>McGregor, who has revealed he still plans to come out of retirement for a UFC return against Diego Sanchez, has already been told by Pacquiao's trainer Roach that he will get destroyed in two rounds as he insisted the Filipino great would have an easier time with him than when he knocked out Ricky Hatton in 2009.</p>

<p>The former UFC world champion went on to admit frustration at not being given the fights he asked for by Dana White, continuing: 'I’d rather fight MMA anyway not sure why I’ve been held back like this, it’s borderline criminal at this stage. </p>

<p>'The biggest number generator in the game asking for four fights since February this year and getting left on seen. It’s pretty f***** up when I keep thinking of it. I’ve been right here this whole time.</p>

<p>'Anyways boxing it is for now and I’m up for this! I hope no bottling takes place here. I’m already agreeing to these limited rules and holding back my full array of weapons. Let’s get it going guys.' </p>

<p>The Irishman went on to say he would have preferred to keep fighting in the UFC</p>

<p>McGregor showed messages where he asked UFC chief Dana White for fights before he retired</p>
