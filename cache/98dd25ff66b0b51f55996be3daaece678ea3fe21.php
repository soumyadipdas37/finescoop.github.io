<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The rumored full title of Sacha Baron Cohen's sequel to his wildly successful 2006 comedy Borat hints at a connection to Vice President Mike Pence.</p>

<p>The sequel is reportedly entitled Borat: Gift of Pornographic Monkey to Vice Premiere Mikhael Pence to Make Benefit Recently Diminished Nation of Kazakhstan, according to a now-deleted listing at the Writers Guild of America website (via The Film Stage).</p>

<p>While the title has yet to be confirmed with any official marketing materials, it does fall in line with the full title of the original film: Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. </p>

<p>Sequel title: The rumored full title of Sacha Baron Cohen's sequel to his wildly successful 2006 comedy Borat hints at a connection to Vice President Mike Pence</p>

<p>If the title is legit, it could hint that Pence could at least tangentially figure into the plot, even if he doesn't appear in the film himself.</p>

<p>The title also insinuates that Pence has ties to Russia, calling him 'Mikhael Pence' instead of Mike Pence, and giving him the Russian title of Vice Premiere instead of Vice President.</p>

<p>Still, it remains unclear why a 'pornographic monkey' would be given as a gift to Pence, and how that would 'make benefit' Kazakhstan, or how the country has been 'recently diminished.'</p>

<p>The original 2006 film featured Cohen playing his Borat character, which he first debuted on his hit TV series Da Ali G Show.</p>

<p>Borat was a TV reporter from Kazakhstand, who was sent to America with his producer Azamat (Ken Davitan).</p>

<p>While Borat is sent to report on the American way of life, he quickly becomes obsessed with the old TV series Baywatch, as he begins a quest to find and marry star Pamela Anderson.</p>

<p>There were first hints that a sequel was happening in August, when Cohen was spotted in his iconic Borat suit driving in an old pickup truck.</p>

<p>Then it was reported in September by Collider that the Borat sequel has already been filmed, and even screened for unspecified industry types.</p>

<p>There is still no word on if there is a film studio behind the project yet, or who paid for the sequel's production budget.</p>
