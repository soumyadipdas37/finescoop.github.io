<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Max Aarons kicked-off his Championship season last weekend while in the background, Barcelona have been trying move him from Norwich to the Nou Camp. </p>

<p>The right-back was one of the Canaries' highlights amid a miserable 2019-20 which saw Daniel Farke's side crash back into the second tier after just a season back in the top-flight. </p>

<p>Aarons only broke into Norwich's first-team during their 2018-19 Championship winning campaign while still in his teens, signing a five-year contract before the Englishman's Premier League exploits caught the eye of Europe's elite.</p>

<p>Barcelona have made bids for Norwich right-back Max Aarons this summer, with two rejected</p>

<p>The right-back impressed despite suffering top-flight relegation with the Canaries last term</p>

<p>New boss Ronald Koeman would now like to secure Aarons for his Barcelona rebuild</p>

<p>New Barcelona boss Ronaldo Koeman now wants to include Aarons in his Nou Camp revolution, but has had two bids shut down by the Norfolk side, according to David Ornstein. </p>

<p>One of the bids was reportedly worth £20m with add-ons, as Barca will now turn their attention towards Ajax starlet Sergino Dest amid their rebuild from a disastrous 2019-20.  </p>

<p>However, Aarons still has hope of a route to the big time, with European champions Bayern Munich weighing-up a move. </p>

<p>Aarons could join European champions Bayern Munich with the Germans monitoring him</p>

<p>In the meantime the 20-year-old is continuing to impress in the Championship for Norwich</p>

<p>The Bundesliga dominators will be watching Aarons closely as Norwich take on Preston on Saturday, looking to continue their strong start to the season after victory over Huddersfield. </p>

<p>Keeping Aarons would be a huge boost to the Canaries' promotion chances, and even with the might of Bayern and Barca chasing the starlet he could prove difficult to unseat this summer.  </p>
