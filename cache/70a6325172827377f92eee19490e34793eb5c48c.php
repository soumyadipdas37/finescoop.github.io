<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain have been encouraged in their pursuit of £72million Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly, after the Italian club's boss Gennaro Gattuso conceded they may need the money to balance the books.</p>

<p>Koulibaly, 29, is one of Europe's most sought-after defenders and has been linked with Manchester City, Barcelona, Real Madrid, as well as PSG this summer.</p>

<p>But as the clock winds down to the transfer deadline on October 5, most suitors for the Senegalese's signature have fallen away, with City set to secure the services of Benfica's Ruben Dias for £65m.</p>

<p>Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly is one of the most sought-after centre backs in Europe</p>

<p>PSG, however, have stayed in the hunt, keen to install a new leader in their back line following Thiago Silva's departure to Chelsea. Unsurprisingly, they are now the odds-on bookies' favourites to secure Koulibaly's signature.</p>

<p>And following a 6-0 win over Genoa this weekend, Napoli head coach Gennaro Gattuso admitted he still fears his talismanic defender will leave the Stadio San Paolo.</p>

<p>Napoli's head coach Gennaro Gattuso has not ruled out the sale of Koulibaly in this window</p>

<p>'I hope he remains with us, selfishly speaking, because he gives us so much both in technical terms and as a character,' Gattuso told Sky Sports Italia after his side disposed of Genoa.</p>

<p>'The world has changed because of the pandemic and I realise all clubs need to balance the books. I hope the call won't arrive, but I'll be nervous about it until transfer deadline day.'</p>

<p>Gattuso is desperate to keep his side's vice-captain. Earlier this month, he described Koulibaly as 'one of the strongest champions in the world in his role'.</p>

<p>Napoli demolished Genoa 6-0 this weekend with Koulibaly helping to keep a clean sheet</p>

<p>Last week, PSG approached Chelsea attempting to agree a loan deal for out-of-favour Antonio Rudiger, but the Blues are not keen, preferring a permanent deal for the centre back, which means the French side are still in the market for a quality defender.</p>

<p>Koulibaly, who is the captain of Senegal, has been at Napoli for six years, after joining from Metz in 2014 for just £6.5m.</p>

<p>He has been instrumental in helping Napoli keep clean sheets in their opening two games this season.</p>
