<p>Christina recently unveiled the ninth season of her HGTV real estate show Flip Or Flop with ex Tarek El Moussa, to whom she was married from 2009 until 2018.</p>

<p>She and Tarek share daughter Taylor, nine, and son Brayden, five. </p>

<p>Ant, for his part, also has children from a previous marriage, to Louise Anstead - daughter Amelie, 19, and son Archie, 14. </p>

<p>'We appreciate your support and ask for privacy for us and our family as we navigate the future,' Christina said in Friday's post; seen earlier in their relationship on Instagram </p>

<p>The news of Ant and Christina's split comes after the British born Ant was recently able to fly home to be with his older children after a months-long delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Earlier in lockdown, Ant had explained that due to flight cancellations he was unable to be with his two older children.</p>

<p>The doting dad was grateful for 'modern communications' and relied on daily FaceTime calls to bridge the gap between himself and his kids. </p>

<p>Across the pond: Ant recently reunited with his older children from a previous marriage, in England – daughter Amelie, 19, and son Archie, 14</p>

<p>Better times: Ant had lamented being separated from part of his family due to the pandemic and said the separation wasn't easy; seen on Instagram with their blended family</p>

<p>However, the separation wasn't easy and he lamented not being able to get his blended family all together.</p>

<p>'I am so over 2020 now!!!! This last week has been particularly TOUGH,' he wrote in June.</p>

<p>Clearly, the stresses of this year also took their toll on his relationship with his second wife, in spite of a cheery post in August celebrating their dating anniversary. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether Ant will stay across the pond, or return to co-parent his young son in Orange County, California with Christina. </p>
