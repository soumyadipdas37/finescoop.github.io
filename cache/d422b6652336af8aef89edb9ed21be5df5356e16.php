<p>Washington said that she and her spouse  are also teaching their two kids about Black history and 'with a focus on Africa'</p>

<p>'Our whole house has become a classroom, really,' Washington said. 'They both do online work with their classes, but I've also been really trying to use this time to teach them things that maybe not be on the curriculum.'</p>
