<p>The number of youngsters being recruited to launder cash has more than tripled in the past three years, according to Barclays.</p>

<p>Criminals are using social media to hire university students as 'money mules' with promises of easy cash, the bank says.</p>

<p>Victims are asked to receive dirty money into their bank accounts and then send it on, thus making it hard to trace and link to crime. </p>

<p>Doing so means they could go to jail for up to 14 years. Students are particularly vulnerable due to a lack of awareness and their desire to make a quick buck.</p>

<p>One in 20 say they are more likely to consider ways of making easy money due to the pandemic, Barclays says.</p>

<p>The bank's research shows that 30 per cent of all money mules are under the age of 21.</p>

<p>Figures released last month by the fraud reporting service Cifas found 62 per cent of cases of suspected money muling involved those under 30 in 2019. </p>

<p>It had identified around 63,000 cases in total, with the number of reported cases of money laundering up 64 per cent in the last five years.</p>

<p>Seven in 10 people identified as suspected money mules by Lloyds Bank were under 30 between June and August, with 18-21-year-olds the likeliest age group to be involved.</p>
