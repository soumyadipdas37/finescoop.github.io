<p>Researchers identified 318 bodies away in the US that have been infected by the microscopic organism called cyanobacteria.</p>

<p>Approximately 86 percent of the outbreaks were in recreational areas, but other reports note a number of dogs and cows were killed.</p>

<p>Data shows that there are less blooms than last year, but wildlife officials due to the coronavirus pandemic they were unable to test for toxins in many bodies of water.</p>

<p>Algae blooms, although aesthetic pleasing, are harmful because they are home to toxin-producing organisms is destructive to both humans and the environment.</p>

<p>Algal blooms, although aesthetic pleasing, are harmful because they are home to toxin-producing phytoplankton, which is destructive to both humans and the environment.</p>

<p>Long linked to animal deaths, high doses of the toxins in humans can cause liver damage and attack the nervous system.</p>

<p>The Environment Working Group (EWG), a non-profit organizations, released a report as a warning ahead of the holiday weekend in the US. </p>

<p>Approximately 86 percent of the outbreaks were in recreational areas, but other reports note a number of dogs and cows were killed. Pictured is a bloom in Pyramid Lake located in Nevada</p>

<p>There were 419 blooms identified in 2019, which is 98 more than the current year, but is due to many states unable to test every body of water in toxins</p>

<p>The team has been tracking outbreaks over a decade, but notes reports are down this year due to cutbacks in states amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Many of the bodies of water hit by blooms are for recreational use, but experts note there has been eight locations that have killed animals – seven killed dogs and one wiped out nine head of cattle.</p>

<p>EWG notes that the Utah Department of Environmental Quality tested 60 lakes and rivers previous years, but was only able to do 18 in 2020.</p>

<p>Reports of the toxic algae have increased since 2010, which saw less than 100 blooms reported. Anne Schechinger, EWG senior economic analyst, said: ‘We really think a big driver of this is climate change</p>

<p>Erica Gaddis, the department’s director, said: ‘Those 18 are largely state parks.’</p>

<p>‘They’re really the areas where the public is most likely to interact directly with the water body, and where we’ve had issues of algal blooms in the past.’</p>

<p>‘Algae blooms flourish and occur more frequently when nutrients like phosphorous and nitrogen wash into water bodies and combine with heat and sunlight.’</p>
