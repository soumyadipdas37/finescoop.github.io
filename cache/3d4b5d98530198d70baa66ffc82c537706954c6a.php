<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you have been out and about in Cornwall's towns recently you may have come across one of the new street marshals.</p>

<p>The individuals are just a couple of the people present on Cornwall's high streets - since they re-opened post-lockdown - to help people follow guidelines and ensure people are respecting social distancing.</p>

<p>Appointed by local town councils, the marshalls are on hand at the busiest times of the day to give friendly help and guidance to those visiting and working in Camborne, Helston, Newquay, Redruth, St Austell, St Ives and Truro.</p>

<p>The new marshals work alongside Cornwall Council's public protection officers who have been giving support and advice to businesses on reopening safely in towns and villages across Cornwall.</p>

<p>'It's good to see people out and about in our towns again,' said Tim Dwelly, Cornwall Council's portfolio holder for the economy.</p>

<p>'Many of our high streets look very different because of the Covid-safe measures that have been put in place such as one-way signage on pavements and reminders to follow social distancing. This has been done so people can visit and work there with confidence.</p>

<p>'The presence of these marshals and our public protection officers play a hugely valuable role in giving a bit of extra help where needed.</p>

<p>'You can be assured that your safety is top-of-mind at all times, so do say a friendly 'hi' (dydh da) when you see them.</p>

<p>One marshall called Dan (see picture, second name not supplied) in particular has been enjoying providing reassurance to some of Camborne's older residents and getting to know local businesses in the process.</p>

<p>'So far, most visitors have been really co-operative and do their best to follow the guidelines and respect social distancing,' he said.</p>

<p>'I especially like helping reassure some of our older residents. I've got to know the local businesses and it's great to know they're all really keen to do what they can to make their customers and staff feel comfortable.'</p>
