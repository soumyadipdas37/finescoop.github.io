<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A chocolatier has released a nostalgic new range inspired by iconic Australian party treats.</p>

<p>Melbourne-headquartered Koko Black has reimagined some of the nation's best-loved sweets in its 'Australian Classics Collection', which includes bite-sized versions of chocolate crackles, Honey Joys and everyone's favourite: lamington slices.</p>

<p>Bars of Koko Vovos, a reinvention of the raspberry and coconut Iced VoVo biscuit, Jam Wagons and Gaytime Goldies – a chocolate twist on the popular toffee and vanilla flavoured ice cream – also feature.</p>

<p>The collection is already available on the brand's website and will launch in Koko Black stores in Melbourne, Sydney, Adelaide, Perth and Canberra on September 24 for a limited time only.</p>

<p>The Melbourne-headquartered chocolatier's latest range features bite-sized bars of Iced VoVos (left) and slabs of lamington (right), the nation's favourite cake</p>

<p>It's designed as a reminder of 'good times past, as well as good times ahead' during a year marred by lockdowns and social distancing restrictions in which few memories have been made.</p>

<p>Prices range from $6 per single bar to $24.90 for a 220gram slab of lamingtons.</p>

<p>And if you can't decide on a favourite, a gift hamper featuring every flavour is also available for $169.</p>

<p>Photos of the collection drew delighted responses after they were shared on Instagram, with comments including 'yes please', 'these look amazing' and 'awesome memories'.</p>

<p>'I haven't had a chocolate crackle in over 30 years, I hang my head in shame. Life is too short,' one woman said.</p>

<p>'This definitely takes me back to my childhood,' said a second.</p>

<p>Prices range from $6 per single bar to $24.90 for a 220gram slab of lamingtons</p>

<p>And that's exactly what Koko Black's head chocolatier and product innovation manager Remco Brigou intended.</p>

<p>'Every single person has memories they can look back to as the 'good old days' – where milk bars were on every corner and where summers were filled with memories of birthday parties, fetes and trips to the tuckshop,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Brigou believes the collection will bring Australians back to their youth as they revel in the nostalgia of old-fashioned flavours. </p>

<p>'We want our Australian Classics Collection to reinvent these moments in a contemporary way, making people feel those fond memories are here – that the golden days are now, and that you're never too old to feel young again.'</p>
