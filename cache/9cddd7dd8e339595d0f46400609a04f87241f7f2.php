<p>The baby still has a little way to go to grow the full mullet beloved by Rod.</p>

<p>But her resemblance to the singer – whose hits include Da Ya Think I’m Sexy? – is uncanny when she wears leopard print.</p>

<p>Baby Tayah Anderson from Ashford, Kent, was born with a shaggy do just like Rod Stewart in his 1970s heyday</p>

<p>Miss Anderson, 33, said: ‘There isn’t one place we’ve been where her hair hasn’t been mentioned by someone. Some people try and have a subtle look, but others will come over and say, “Oh my God. She’s got so much hair”.’</p>

<p>Miss Anderson and fiance Lewis Murphy, 29, a diamond driller, were told by the sonographer at the 32-week scan that she could notice a bit of hair. </p>

<p>But the couple did not realise just how much she had until she was born weighing 8lb 6oz in Ashford, Kent, in January. </p>

<p>Miss Anderson recalled: ‘Even the midwives said, “Oh my God”.</p>

<p>Mother Corinna Anderson was stunned when Tayah was delivered with the head of thick wild hair</p>

<p>‘Lewis and I both had a little bit of brown hair when we were born, but nothing like Tayah.’</p>

<p>Tayah is now eight months and her locks have started to become lighter with blonde and red streaks.</p>

<p>Miss Anderson added: ‘When she wakes up it’s just wild, sticking up all over the place. It looks like she’s been dragged through a hedge backwards.</p>

<p>‘We have never cut her hair and don’t plan to anytime soon.’</p>
