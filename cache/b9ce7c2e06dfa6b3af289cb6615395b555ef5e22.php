<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Brownlow Medal count will be a far different affair this year with organisers forced to adapt due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>The ceremony, which is usually held at the glitzy Crown Palladium in Melbourne, will be a 'small-scale this year and held at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in Queensland instead. </p>

<p>Only players who are no longer competing in the season will be allowed to attend AFL's night of nights with their partners.  </p>

<p>Fortunately, 15 out of the 18 AFL clubs are in Queensland playing out the rest of the season with travel between South Australia permitted. </p>

<p>Instead of being held at the glitzy Crown Palladium in locked-down Melbourne, this year's ceremony will reportedly be a 'small-scale event' at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre (pictured) in Queensland</p>

<p>Compere Hamish McLachlan will not be able to attend the event and will be hosting via virtual crosses from Channel 7's Melbourne studio. </p>

<p>Multiple player hubs with TV cameras will be at the event so McLachlan can perform 'virtual interviews' with those attending. </p>

<p>WAGs normally strut their stuff on the Brownlow red carpet but this year will be a no-frills affair, according to celebrity stylist Lana Wilkins. </p>

<p>'I think we are just going to park it this year and then go hell for leather and blow it out of the water in 2021 when it's back in Melbourne,' Ms Wilkinson told The Herald Sun. </p>

<p>Ms Wilkinson has previously worked with many glamorous WAGS such as Brit Selwood, Jordan Ablett, Jessie Murphy and Belinda Stone. </p>

<p>A senior AFL executive confirmed it would be a low-key affair: 'There won't be all that big red-carpet hullabaloo.'  </p>

<p>The Brisbane Lions' Lachie Neale is the favourite to win this year's Brownlow Medal. </p>

<p>An exact date for the Brownlow Medal count is yet to be confirmed by the AFL but it is expected to take place at the start of Grand Final week. </p>

<p>Players competing in the Final will not be able to attend.  </p>

<p>Like the Brownlow, the AFL Grand Final has also been moved to Queensland to avoid Australia's COVID capital Melbourne. </p>

<p>It will now be played at The Gabba in Brisbane on October 24.  </p>
