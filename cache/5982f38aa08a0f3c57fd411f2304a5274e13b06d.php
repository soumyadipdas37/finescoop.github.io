<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez was spotted at Lionel Messi's house on Thursday as the Barcelona pair's respective futures look more and more unclear.</p>

<p>Messi is in deep talks with the LaLiga giants over his future next season following his shock transfer request last month. Suarez himself has been linked with a move away from the Camp Nou with Italian side Juventus circling around his availability. </p>

<p>And the Uruguayan forward was snapped at Messi's house along with his wife Sofia Balbi, which has intensified speculation over whether the pair have said farewell as team-mates. </p>

<p>Luis Suarez was spotted going to Lionel Messi's house on Thursday amid doubts over his exit</p>

<p>Suarez and Messi could leave Barcelona this year and may have said goodbye to each other</p>

<p>The Barcelona attacking duo are not only best friends but also neighbours. It is understood Messi had a one-hour meeting with his father today about his future, with Suarez joining the Barcelona captain in a game of Padel before the meeting. </p>

<p>Messi's saga took another twist today as the Argentinian forward's father Jorge, who also acts as his agent, confirmed that his son could stay at Barcelona this year and leave on a free transfer ahead of next season. </p>

<p>This statement comes just a day after Messi Senior told reporters that it would be very difficult for his son to remain a Barcelona player for the coming season. Manchester City, Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain have all been linked with the player's signature. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old is currently in a legal dispute with Barcelona over a clause in his contract which states he can leave on a free transfer at the end of the season.</p>

<p>Messi's father Jorge (in car) had a meeting with his son on Thursday over his future</p>

<p>Messi (L) and Suarez (R) are friends and neighbours - they played Padel before the meeting</p>

<p>Messi attempted to activate that clause when he made the transfer request via burofax in August, but the Catalan club told their talisman that the clause expired on June 10.</p>

<p>LaLiga backed Barcelona on their stance, stating that any club who wants to sign Messi must pay his release clause, which stands at £630million. </p>

<p>Messi's father met with Barcelona earlier this week to come to an arrangement, but Barcelona stood firm on the issue. The player has not reported back for pre-season training and is currently still on strike.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Suarez was reportedly told by new Barcelona head coach Ronald Koeman that he is no longer required at the Camp Nou.</p>

<p>Suarez has been strongly linked with a £4.4million move to Serie A giants Juventus </p>

<p>The Dutch coach told the Uruguayan striker in a one-minute phone call that his time at Barcelona coach is over, despite Suarez being the third-highest goalscorer in the club's history. </p>

<p>Reports in Italy said that Juventus are looking to snap up the 33-year-old this summer for a deal worth £4.4million. </p>

<p>The Serie A champions are willing to offer Suarez a £9million-a-year contract, with several bonus clauses to be added, according to Sky Sports Italia.</p>

<p>However, Suarez is reportedly demanding £22million in severance pay, putting his proposed Juventus deal in doubt.  </p>
