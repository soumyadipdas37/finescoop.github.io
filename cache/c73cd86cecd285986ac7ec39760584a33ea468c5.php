<p>Jamie O'Hara has hit out at Spurs, branding them 'average' and 'like a bunch of spoiled kids'</p>

<p>Tottenham lost opening Premier League game last Sunday, falling to a 1-0 defeat by Everton</p>

<p>Prior to Bale's move O'Hara labelled the squad 'average' with just forwards Harry Kane and Son Heung-min their only world-class stars.</p>

<p>He told talkSPORT: 'They are so stretched, it's unbelievable. I mean, anyone could play against Spurs!</p>

<p>'Only two of them are world-class [Kane and Son].</p>

<p>'You go through that team: Davies, average; Alderweireld, average; Dier, below average; Doherty, just signed, decent; Hojbjerg, average; Winks, decent; Alli, average; Son, brilliant; Kane, brilliant; Lucas Moura, touch and go.</p>

<p>'The rest of them… They look like a bunch of spoiled kids! </p>

<p>'Get some leaders and characters in the camp and pull your fingers out; this is Spurs Football Club you are playing for.'</p>

<p>O'Hara, who was at White Hart Lane for six years, launched into a passionate rant about squad</p>

<p>O'Hara, who was at Spurs for six years, explained his tirade earlier this week on his Twitter</p>

<p>Tottenham's squad will be fully tested over the coming weeks as they face playing nine games in just 22 days. </p>

<p>Following his rant earlier this week, O'Hara, who made over 50 appearances for Spurs, wrote on Twitter: 'Maybe rattled a few cages today on my Spurs rant, but I’m just passionate about the club which I was lucky enough to play for with some incredible players and supported my whole life, just want to see them show some passion for the badge and some ambition #spurs #honesty.'</p>

<p>Mourinho's side kick off their Europa League campaign later when they come up against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in Bulgaria.</p>
