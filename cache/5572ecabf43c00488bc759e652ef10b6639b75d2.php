<p>Scientists found they were about 4 per cent larger than their country cousins and reckon this is because they have to work harder to find food, travelling across roads – which break up the gardens, cemeteries, parks and other green spaces where they seek the next patch of flowers.</p>

<p>Larger bees may be better able to face city commutes to find pollen, as they are superior at flying long distances, with larger flight muscles.</p>

<p>Bumblebees in cities are about four per cent bigger and more hard-working than those living in the countryside, according to a study</p>

<p>They are also less easy targets for predators and appear better at spotting flowers and recalling their location. </p>

<p>The study compared 931 bees from green spaces close to nine German cities with 898 bees from rural areas with few roads and lots of farmland and forests.</p>

<p>The bees the researchers looked at were red-tailed bumblebees, common carder bees and buff-tailed bumblebees – one of the most common species in the UK.</p>

<p>They measured the size of bumblebees based on the distance between their wings – and found they tend to be bigger in cities.</p>

<p>All three species were larger when there were several roads within a 270 yard radius, suggesting they had to be bulkier to fly across them to reach other flowers. </p>

<p>'Larger bumblebees can see better, have larger brains and better memories,' said biologist Dr Antonella Soro of Martin Luther University in Halle-Wittenberg, whose study was published in the journal Evolutionary Applications.</p>

<p>Scientists found city bumblebees to be larger because they have to work harder to find food, travelling across roads to the next patch of flowers (beekeeping in Manhattan, pictured)</p>

<p>'They can also travel greater distances, which is an advantage in a fragmented landscape such as the urban one.'</p>

<p>Bees in urban areas also appeared to be more productive, based on how well they pollinated red clover plants examined for the study. </p>

<p>Previous evidence has shown bigger bees are busier, visiting more flowers in a day than their smaller counterparts.</p>

<p>Bumblebees were smaller when they lived in warmer temperatures, the study found, but the heat from cities did not appear to add to this effect.</p>
