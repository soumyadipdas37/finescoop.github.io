<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Priti Patel will launch an official review into sentencing for criminals who kill officers after meeting PC Andrew Harper’s widow today.</p>

<p>Lissie Harper has campaigned for a new law meaning those who kill emergency workers are jailed for life. </p>

<p>And the Home Secretary is said to be ‘fully supportive’ of calls for tougher jail terms. </p>

<p>Mrs Harper and the Police Federation have demanded ‘Harper’s Law’ in memory of the 28-year-old PC who was killed by a gang of three teenage thieves last year. </p>

<p>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland will also join the highlevel meeting at the Home Office this morning.</p>

<p>And sources said once ministers had listened to Mrs Harper, they will commission a review into judges’ sentencing powers.</p>

<p>Lissie Harper has campaigned for harsher sentences for criminals who kill emergency workers, following the death of her husband PC Andrew Harper</p>

<p>‘Priti attended PC Harper’s funeral as one of her first acts in this role and she is pretty scarred by the whole thing,’ said a Home Office source. </p>

<p>‘Ministers are going to officially review sentencing for killing a police officer and looking very carefully at the proposals put forward by Mrs Harper. </p>

<p>‘The Home Secretary is fully supportive of their cause and stands fully behind Mrs Harper.’ </p>

<p>A petition calling for ‘Harper’s Law’ has already gathered nearly 650,000 signatures. </p>

<p>Mrs Harper yesterday clarified what the law would entail. </p>

<p>Home Secretary Priti Patel, pictured on Tuesday, will meet with Lissie Harper later on today </p>

<p>She wrote: ‘Harper’s Law will be a law which will mean that a person found guilty of killing a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor, paramedic or prison officer as a direct result of a crime they have committed then they would be jailed for life. </p>

<p>‘This means that a life sentence would be imposed, asking for a minimum term in prison. Harper’s Law is not asking for whole life orders.’ </p>

<p>She added she was driven ‘by the heinous killing of my brave husband and the safety of his colleagues in the future’.</p>

<p>Last week the Daily Mail revealed the taxpayer footed the £465,769 legal aid bill for the gang which killed PC Harper by dragging him behind a car. </p>

<p>All three killers – ringleader Henry Long, 19, and accomplices Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18 – have submitted new legal challenges. </p>

<p>Long applied for permission to appeal against his 16-year prison sentence last week. He admitted manslaughter but was cleared of murder. </p>

<p>Cole and Bowers had already lodged applications seeking permission to challenge their manslaughter convictions and their 13-year prison sentences. </p>

<p>All three killers – ringleader Henry Long, 19, (left) and accomplices Albert Bowers (right) and Jessie Cole (centre) , both 18 – have submitted new legal challenges</p>

<p>Separately, the jail terms given to all three have already been referred to the Court of Appeal by the Attorney General for judges to decide whether they were too lenient. </p>

<p>They will all have to serve at least two-thirds of their sentence in jail before they are eligible for release.</p>

<p>This means Long could be out in just ten years and eight months and the two others could be freed in as little as eight and a-half years. </p>

<p>The Harpers wed just a month before the Thames Valley Police officer was killed after responding to an emergency call in Berkshire last year.</p>
