<p>Dead: Police were searching for Julian Paris, 54, who allegedly shot dead his wife at a crowded park in Florida</p>

<p>The dead body of a man wanted by police in Florida for allegedly murdering his wife in front of their kids has been found.</p>

<p>Julian Paris, 54, was wanted by police after he callously shot his wife Liza Nicole Adderly, 34, dead at Dr. Phillips Community Park in Orlando in front of their three children.</p>

<p>However, Orange County officers confirmed that Mr Paris had been found dead by family members from a self-inflected gunshot wound, next to his late son's grave at Woodlawn Cemetery.</p>

<p>Mr Paris had been on the run since May 7 after investigators said he fatally shot his wife at 4.20pm in broad daylight.</p>

<p>Ms Adderly had taken her three children to a play date with another family when Paris showed up, officers said.</p>

<p>He then shot and killed his wife in front of their shocked children who were standing next to their mother and are aged four, 13 and 15.</p>

<p>Eyewitnesses said the suspect fled from the park in a white Kia Spectra compact hatchback, with the Florida number plate K259IV.</p>

<p>The couple’s three children watched as their dad sped away from the parking lot wearing a red fedora and red T-shirt, according to a witness.</p>

<p>Shocked onlookers along with the couple's children were among the first to dial 911 for emergency services to get help after the horror at the park unfolded.</p>

<p>Murder scene: Police were searching for a Florida man who brazenly shot his wife to death at a crowded park in Orlando but he was later found dead</p>

<p>Sheriff’s spokesman Jeff Williamson said: 'It shows how brazen he was to come here in broad daylight and shoot this woman in broad daylight in front of multiple witnesses, including juveniles.'</p>

<p>'I think it says a lot about the person and the crime itself. It’s heinous,' he added.</p>

<p>Mr Paris had several aliases, but his given name was Rick Adderly, according to his family.</p>

<p>The couple had a history of domestic abuse and officers were called out to an incident between the pair two hours before Mrs Adderly was killed.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the 34-year-old mother of three was shoved by Mr Paris during a meeting at his job as an irrigation worker, according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office.</p>

<p>Ms Adderly was so distraught that she went back to her car, screaming for help, say police officers.</p>

<p>She was shot to death just a few hours later.</p>

<p>Orange County police officers launched a widespread manhunt for the 54-year-old but his daughter found him dead at 7.20p.m. on May 8.</p>

<p>Investigators are still trying to determine why he killed himself.</p>

<p>Police line: Julian Paris, 54, had fled the park in a white Kia Spectra watched by his three kids</p>

<p>After more than 16 years of marriage, the couple separated a month before the killing.</p>

<p>Relatives said that the graveside where Mr Paris was found dead belonged to their 17-year-old son - who was their eldest - but had been hit by a car and killed in January 2012.</p>

<p>Jane Watrel of the Orange County Sheriff's Office said: 'You all know that he was going through a separation, but we do not know why he took this extreme drastic measure.</p>

<p>'We got the call around 7:25 p.m [from] family who called saying they found the body of Mr Paris at his son's grave.'</p>

<p>The tragic couple married in 1998, when she was 18 and her husband 38.</p>

<p>Deputies are still looking for the deceased man's car.</p>

<p>Adrianna Adderlini, 23, a relative through marriage told The Orlando Sentinel: 'This is very surprising because they've been so good after the death of their son — just holding their family strong.'</p>

<p>The couple leave behind their three surviving children.</p>
