<p>The couple 'want to give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do', a source said. </p>

<p>It comes after they signed a £112 million Netflix deal to make TV series, films and children's shows for the streaming service.  </p>

<p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have reportedly agreed to star in a fly-on-the-wall Netflix reality series with cameras following them for three months</p>

<p>The docuseries will follow the couple for three months and focus on their charitable work, according to a report in The Sun. </p>

<p>'They may have had all these lofty ideas about producing epics highlighting environmental causes and the poverty gap, but Netflix obviously want their pound of flesh,' a source told the publication. </p>

<p>'It will all be very tasteful, and not Katie Price and Peter Andre-style reality TV, but they want to give people a glimpse into their lives and see all the charity work they do.'</p>

<p>According to the source, 'much of the docuseries will be about their philanthropy rather than what they get up to behind closed doors.</p>

<p>The docuseries will follow the couple for three months and focus on their charitable work</p>

<p>'But it will still be a fascinating insight and Meghan hopes viewers will get to see the real her.'</p>

<p>Editor of Majesty Magazine Ingrid Seward said the couple were 'hypocritical' for agreeing to the reality series after they left the UK for the U.S. for greater privacy. </p>

<p>'It is extraordinary. This is exactly what they said they wouldn't do,' she said.  </p>

<p>PR executive Mark Borkowski told The Sun: 'Viewers will be interested to see what they are up to but there needs to be authenticity.</p>

<p>'They have laid out a grand plan and are fulfilling it. They are doing this all on their own terms.' </p>

<p>A Netflix spokesperson told the publication:'The couple already have several projects in development, including an innovative nature docuseries and an animated series that celebrates inspiring women.</p>

<p>'But we are not disclosing any of the programming slate at this time.'</p>
