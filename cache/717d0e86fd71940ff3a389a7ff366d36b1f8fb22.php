<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Almost 80 music festival revellers trampled in a crowd crush four years ago will finally be compensated as part of a multi-million dollar class action settlement.</p>

<p>Nineteen festival goers were hospitalised and another 76 needed first aid after they were caught up in a stampede that broke out between acts at the Falls Festival in Lorne in regional Victoria on December 30, 2016.</p>

<p>Falls Festival organisers will pay out almost $7million to 77 revellers after the 'lifechanging' settlement was recently approved by the Victorian Supreme Court. </p>

<p>A third of the most seriously injured victims will receive 'hundreds of thousands of dollars'. </p>

<p>Lead plaintiff of the class action Michela Burke (pictured) suffered nerve damage when she was injured in a crowd stampede at the Fall festival in Lorne in December 2016</p>

<p>'The compensation payments will enable group members to look to, and plan for, the future. In respect of some of the larger claims, we anticipate the compensation payment will be life changing,' Maddens Lawyers' Kathryn Emeny said. </p>

<p>She said many injured revellers are still dealing with the incident 'in one way or another' almost four years on.</p>

<p>Some have developed post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

<p>Revellers were leaving Australian rock band DMAs' performance to see London Grammar on another stage when the overcrowded exit became congested, which resulted in revellers being crushed and trampled on.  </p>

<p>Lead plaintiff in the class action Michela Burke suffered nerve damage to her left arm when she was caught up in the stampede.  </p>

<p>'I am relieved that the matter is close to finalisation and we can finally begin to put the crowd crush behind us,' Ms Burke told ABC's Hack.  </p>

<p>Dozens of festival revellers were injured in the crowd stampede between acts in 2016</p>

<p>She later told SBS 'that she still feels 'jumpy' when there's oncoming traffic. </p>

<p>'I remember being in a washing machine and someone trying to pull me out. Then I had a blank. I woke up on the grass somewhere and realised my arm was paralysed,' she told The Feed in 2018.</p>

<p>'You go to a festival thinking that you're going to have fun and feel safe. Thinking that you're in a situation where you could die is the last thing on your mind.'  </p>

<p>Maddy (surname withheld), who suffered severe bruising around her eyes and a fractured pelvis was also pleased about the settlement.</p>

<p>She still bears long lasting emotional scars from the ordeal and can no longer listen to music from the band that was performing at the festival.</p>

<p>'It does reflect the pain and suffering that occurred. But it is just money as well. The most important thing that I've been trying to focus on is my my own mental state... just working through those things mentally,' Maddy told Hack.</p>

<p>Music fan Maddy (pictured) will be compensated for the physical and mental pain suffered</p>

<p>Festival organisers hope the the settlement will bring relief and closure for all those involved.</p>

<p>'We also want to assure the participants and all those who attend our events, that health and safety is our number one priority. We care deeply about the welfare of our patrons, and are continually improving and adapting our safety protocols on an ongoing basis,' they said in a statement. </p>

<p>A class action was launched after Worksafe Victoria declared in 2017 there was 'insufficient evidence to prosecute' event organisers, despite the mass injuries.</p>

<p>Revellers paid anywhere from $249 to $468 plus booking fees to go to the four-day camping festival. </p>

<p>Also among the injured was Nick Moriarty, then 22, who was at the front of the crowd. </p>

<p>He tried to break free but was trapped under bodies but he saw men and women being carried off unconscious.</p>

<p>He sustained swelling to his knee and ankle in the stampede.</p>

<p>'It was just over and there was too many people in the first place. We were leaving and everyone starting pushing and pushing,' Mr Moriarty told Daily Mail Australia at the time.</p>

<p>'A lot of people helped and people that were just at the festival helped and all the security were helping. When we got sent to the medical room there were heaps of people in there. People required stitches and there was large gashes. There was a lot of blood.'  </p>

<p>The iconic festival is traditionally held across multiple days over the New Year period in Byron Bay, Lorne, Fremantle and Marion Bay.</p>

<p>The popular event taking a hiatus this summer due to COVID-19 restrictions but has vowed to return bigger and better in 2021.</p>
