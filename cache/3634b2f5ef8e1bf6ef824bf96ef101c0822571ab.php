<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amazon came under fire last night after admitting it paid just £73million more in taxes in Britain last year, despite racking up almost £3billion in extra sales.</p>

<p>The online retail behemoth published details of its finances in an effort to be more transparent after being criticised for years for not paying its fair share.</p>

<p>The figures showed business was booming even before the coronavirus crisis fuelled a dramatic surge in online shopping. </p>

<p>But Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge said Amazon should be ‘shouldering more of the burden’ having ‘benefited fantastically’ from the pandemic.   </p>

<p>The retailer said sales jumped by more than a quarter to £13.73billion last year – up from £10.89billion in 2018. </p>

<p>But it incurred just £293million in ‘direct taxes’ last year, an increase of just £73million on 2018.</p>

<p>Amazon said it paid a smaller proportion of its profits as tax last year because its investment of more than £690million on new warehouses and an office in Manchester meant it qualified for tax breaks.     </p>

<p>The company has accelerated its expansion efforts in the UK in 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic stoked demand.</p>

<p>Last week, it announced plans to hire another 7,000 staff this year to aid its growth strategy.</p>

<p>On Monday, the firm also announced John Boumphrey as the new boss of its UK operations, taking over from current country manager Doug Gurr in November.</p>

<p>Amazon, which is valued at around 1.6 trillion US dollars (£1.24 trillion), was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, a hedge fund executive.</p>

<p>Mr Bezos is the world’s richest person and worth a fortune of around 193.5 billion US dollars (£148.5 billion).</p>
