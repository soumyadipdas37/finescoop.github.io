<p>She said: 'There's so many relationships in Hollywood — and in the history of the world — where people have large age gaps. I just think anyone should be able to date who they want to date.'</p>

<p>Morrone continued: 'I understand the association, but I'm confident that will continue to slip away and be less of a conversation.'</p>
