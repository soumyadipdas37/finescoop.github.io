<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has demonstrated just how easy it is for someone to sneak drugs into your drink, even when it is right in front of you, in a bid to raise awareness about keeping your beverages safe on a night out.</p>

<p>Mell Hall from Toronto, recently uploaded a video on her TikTok page in which she explains why holding coaster above a glass is one of the more effective ways to protect your drinks when you're at a club.</p>

<p>However, users lashed out at her, calling the safety measure 'unnecessary' - so, Mell decided to film another clip showing how easy it is to drug a drink.</p>

<p>Mell recreated various scenarios that attackers could stage at a club, using a glass of water on her kitchen table and corn kernels as the 'drug'.</p>

<p>Mell dropped the corn kernel into the glass unnoticed in five different ways, including adding one while extending her hand for a handshake, and handing over cash to pay for a drink. </p>

<p>Mell Hall showed herself seamlessly dropping a kernel of corn into the drink on the counter</p>

<p>The video has since gone viral on TikTok, gaining over 1.6 million views leaving users shocked at how she 'drugged' the drink in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>One user commented: 'I had to watch it twice because I DIDN'T NOTICE THE FIRST TIME'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Jesus I didn't even notice you dropping things in the first time I watched the video which is EXACTLY THE POINT IVAN'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, one wrote: 'That's actually so terrifying. I had no idea what you were doing until you held up the glass kernels. It's really that easy. Wow.'</p>

<p>Mell slipped a corn kernel into the glass while extending her hand to shake and making gestures during an imagined conversation. </p>

<p>She then showed herself dropping several piece of corn, which represents a date rape drug, into the glass whilst shaking a hand and ordering a drink</p>

<p>In one subtle move the TikTok showed how easy it is for attackers to drop something into a drink whilst making a simple hand gesture during a conversation</p>

<p>She also showed how easy it is to drop a pill in a glass while handing money to a bartender, and pretended to bump into the table and slipped a pill while apologizing. </p>

<p>Another trick was to drop one into the drink while picking up her own drink in the adjacent glass. </p>

<p>Speaking about the video, Mell said: 'I made it in response to a comment on another one of my videos.</p>

<p>'I had been talking about how coasters are a simple and effective way to protect your drink.</p>

<p>'There had been some comments from people who felt this was paranoid or unnecessary. The comment I decided to respond to was about whether or not a drink being spiked while you're holding it is actually noticeable.</p>

<p>'I decided the best way to respond and explain the risk was with a video.</p>

<p>'I thought a visual would be more impactful. So, I searched my kitchen for something pill-sized, which were popcorn kernels, and I got to work. It was a spontaneous thing.</p>

<p>'I never expected it to go viral!</p>

<p>'I did the whole video in 15 to 20 minutes. When I decided to use popcorn kernels, I practised palming them for a minute or two before filming.</p>

<p>Mel hopes the video will make people more aware of the dangers they face, with many of her viewers previously doubting the need for protecting your drinks when you're at a club</p>

<p>'I think I did three or four takes of each shot to make sure that I didn't miss the glass and the camera angle was good.</p>

<p>'It was eye-opening. I hadn't expected it to be so easy. I knew that people could drop something in quickly and discreetly, but I thought it would take a lot more practice to do it myself.'</p>

<p>Mel said her intention was to encourage people to be more vigilant and build safer habits for themselves</p>

<p>Mell encouraged people to be vigilant and cover their glasses with a drink cover or napkin to ensure they stay safe, and also to have trusted friends around you, just in case.</p>

<p>She said: 'My intention when I made this video wasn't to scare people into never going out. I know from the comments that fear is a lot of peoples' first reaction to seeing this.</p>

<p>'I would have been happy if just one person would have walked away from watching this video and decided to be more vigilant and build safer habits for themselves.</p>

<p>'To my surprise, it looks like millions of people are going to re-evaluate how they protect themselves and those around them!</p>

<p>'People have been so generous in the comments and have jumped in to give personal anecdotes and share how they keep themselves safer when they go out.</p>

<p>Viewers took to the comment section to share their amazement at how unnoticeable the drugging had been</p>

<p>'We've talked about covering your drink with your hand, covering it with a coaster, using a silicone or fabric drink cover, poking your straw through a napkin and securing the napkin to the glass with your hair elastic, nail polishes that change color when they come into contact with a drug, drink testing kits, drug-detecting bracelets, ordering a bottle instead of a glass so that it's a smaller target, and plenty more.</p>

<p>'People have also talked about how it's important to watch your bartender make your drink and to buy a new one if ever you put yours down or feel unsure.</p>

<p>'With all of that said, I think allies are most important. The reality is that, if someone does manage to spike your drink, your awareness has been taken away from you.</p>

<p>'You're now relying on the people around you to recognize that something is wrong and to help. That's why we must be looking out for others as much as ourselves.</p>

<p>'So, if your friend is acting weird or if you see something suspicious across the bar, check-in with them. Allies save lives.'</p>
