<p>Ebonie Sanderson (pictured) released the explicit messages along with a warning for single women across Sydney to avoid the 'privileged misogynistic PIG'</p>

<p>Writing on Instagram Ms Sanderson said: 'This is what happens when you say NO or call out a man for being disrespectful.</p>

<p>'You apparently earn yourself the right to get verbally abused and fat-shamed on more than one platform.</p>

<p>'No I didn't 'ask for it' and yes, I'm entitled to change my mind and tell someone I'm not interested anymore because I feel uncomfortable and intimidated by one's aggressive and forceful nature.</p>

<p>'If anyone comes across this man on dating apps or social media, please report him.</p>

<p>Ms Sanderson shared the horrifying experience on Instagram as she called out the man's behaviour</p>

<p>Ms Sanderson shared a series of messages she had received on Snapchat from 'Tom', after declining his invitation to come to his house</p>

<p>'I will never change my weight for anyone else but MYSELF!!!'</p>

<p>Ms Sanderson shared a series of messages she had received on Snapchat from 'Tom', after declining his invitation to come to his house. </p>

<p>'The fat liberal arts chick... teach me,' he wrote.</p>

<p>'I know you know deep down you are below me, that there is hierarchy in society.</p>

<p>'And the dysgenic like you are there to serve us.</p>

<p>'You are the inferiors.'</p>

<p>She also shared voice messages from the man which became increasingly vulgar and abusive before she blocked him. </p>

<p>'You're actually a fat f***ing pig. You know that? Thanks. You did waste my time,' he said.</p>

<p>'You're f*<strong>ing ugly. Your a</strong> looks OKAY and you would have been one f***. You would have been just one f*** because you're a disgusting fat pig.'  </p>

<p>When she called him out for his aggressive behaviour he then doubled down and defended himself.</p>

<p>'Look at my f***ing face. I don't have to struggle to get laid. I especially don't need a FOUR like you to get laid.'</p>

<p>Clementine Ford shared the series of messages on Friday night along with a screenshot of the man's LinkedIn profile and the name of the company where he worked.</p>

<p>'This is horrifying male entitlement. It's abuse meted out in response to rejection. It's violent and disgusting,' she wrote.</p>

<p>In the 24 hours since the post was shared thousands of women have rallied around Ms Sanderson in a show of support.</p>

<p>The response was big that Clementine Ford shared an update urging her followers to stop contacting the man's company calling out his behaviour.</p>

<p>'Someone has forwarded me an email they were sent from the CEO of the company Tom worked for,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'If anyone comes across this man on dating apps or social media, please report him,' Ms Sanderson wrote</p>

<p>'HE HAS BEEN FIRED, EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY!'  </p>

<p>Ms Sanderson told Daily Mail Australia the situation unfolded over a period of only hours.  </p>

<p>'He was persistent.. he wanted me to come over THAT night. That was when I started to feel uncomfortable,' she said.</p>

<p>She sent him a message apologising and saying she was no longer comfortable meeting up with him. </p>

<p>'Then all these voice messages came through, just abusive messages about my appearance, and my weight,' she said. </p>

<p>Ms Sanderson told Daily Mail Australia the situation unfolded over a period of only hours</p>

<p>She blocked him on Snapchat and Instagram, but he added her another account and continued messaging her.  </p>

<p>She said despite being a strong and confident woman the comments he made were incredibly hurtful.  </p>

<p>'I am I am really comfortable with my weight and initially I was like this doesn't matter but then in the end I realised an insult is an insult and I realised subconsciously I couldn't stop thinking about it,' she said. </p>

<p>'That was when I snapped and thought he can't get away with this and have no consequences whatsoever.'</p>

<p>So she drafted up a post and hit publish on Instagram. </p>

<p>‘I woke up with hundreds of messages - so many people have messaged me to say they had experienced this or that they resonate with this or that they are struggling with online dating,' she said. </p>

<p> She said despite being a strong and confident woman the comments he made were incredibly hurtful</p>

<p>Invenco CEO Dave Scott told Daily Mail Australia he dismissed 'Tom' after receiving a flood of angry emails this morning. </p>

<p>'I had a read through of the contract and validated that it was an act of serious misconduct and that he was no longer fit for employment with us,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Scott said he was 'shocked and disgusted' by the messages. </p>

<p>'There is just no place in our workplace for someone who treats women with that amount of disrespect.</p>

<p>'I have four daughters aged between 10 months and nine years old so that was one of the first things I thought about, and my blood boiled to imagine someone to ever speak to one of my little girls like that.' </p>

<p>Tom's social media accounts on LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook have disappeared since the posts were shared.   </p>
