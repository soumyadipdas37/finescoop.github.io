<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The first person to be cured of HIV, Timothy Ray Brown - known as the 'Berlin Patient'-- has died after a battle with cancer, the International Aids Society (IAS) announced Wednesday.</p>

<p>The 54-year-old made medical history and became a symbol of hope for the tens of millions of people living with the virus that causes AIDS when he was cured more than a decade ago.</p>

<p>He had been living with a recurrence of leukaemia for several months and received hospice care at his home in Palm Springs, California.</p>

<p>'Berlin Patient' Timothy Ray Brown was successfully cured of the HIV virus 12 years ago</p>

<p>'On behalf of all its members... the IAS sends its condolences to Timothy´s partner, Tim, and his family and friends,' said IAS President Adeeba Kamarulzaman.</p>

<p>'We owe Timothy and his doctor, Gero Hutter, a great deal of gratitude for opening the door for scientists to explore the concept that a cure for HIV is possible.'</p>

<p>Brown was diagnosed with HIV while was studying in Berlin in 1995. A decade later, he was diagnosed with leukaemia, a cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow.</p>

<p>To treat his leukaemia, his doctor at the Free University of Berlin used a stem cell transplant from a donor who had a rare genetic mutation that gave him natural resistance to HIV, hoping it may wipe out both diseases.</p>

<p>It took two painful and dangerous procedures, but it was a success: in 2008 Brown was declared free of the two ailments, and was initially dubbed 'the Berlin Patient' at a medical conference to preserve his anonymity.</p>

<p>Two years later, he decided to break his silence and went on to become a public figure, giving speeches and interviews and starting his own foundation.</p>

<p>'I am living proof that there could be a cure for AIDS,' he told AFP in 2012. 'It's very wonderful, being cured of HIV.'</p>

<p>Ten years after Brown was cured, a second HIV sufferer -- dubbed 'the London Patient' -- was revealed to be in remission 19 months after undergoing a similar procedure.</p>

<p>The patient, Adam Castillejo, is currently HIV-free. In August a California woman was reported to have no traces of HIV despite not using anti-retroviral treatment.</p>

<p>It is thought she may be the first person to be cured of HIV without undergoing the risky bone marrow treatment.</p>

<p>Sharon Lewin, president-elect of the IAS and director of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, Australia, praised Brown as a 'champion and advocate' of a cure for HIV.</p>

<p>'It is the hope of the scientific community that one day we can honour his legacy with a safe, cost-effective and widely accessible strategy to achieve HIV remission and curs using gene edition or techniques that boost immune control,' she said.</p>

<p>The vast majority of humans carry the gene CCR5. </p>

<p>In many ways, it is incredibly unhelpful. </p>

<p>It affects our odds of surviving and recovering from a stroke, according to recent research. </p>

<p>And it is the main access point for HIV to overtake our immune systems. </p>

<p>But some people carry a mutations that prevents CCR5 from expressing itself, effectively blocking or eliminating the gene.  </p>

<p>Those few people in the world are called 'elite controllers' by HIV experts. They are naturally resistant to HIV. </p>

<p>If the virus ever entered their body, they would naturally 'control' the virus as if they were taking the virus-suppressing drugs that HIV patients require.</p>

<p>Both the Berlin patient and the London patient received stem cells donated from people with that crucial mutation.</p>

<p>WHY HAS IT NEVER WORKED BEFORE?</p>

<p>'There are many reasons this hasn't worked,' Dr Janet Siliciano, a leading HIV researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told DailyMail.com. </p>

<ol>
<li>FINDING DONORS</li>
</ol>

<p>'It's incredibly difficult to find HLA-matched bone marrow [i.e. someone with the same proteins in their blood as you],' Dr Siliciano said.</p>

<p>'It's even more difficult to find the CCR5 mutation.' </p>

<ol start="2">
<li>INEFFECTIVE TRANSPLANT LEADS TO CANCER RELAPSE</li>
</ol>

<p>Second, there is always a risk that the bone marrow won't 'take'. </p>

<p>'Sometimes you don't become fully "chimeric", meaning you still have a lot of your own cells.'</p>

<p>That is one of the two most common reasons for previous attempts failing: their immune system is not fully replaced, then the cancer comes back and they can't survive it.  </p>

<ol start="3">
<li>GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE: THE OLD IMMUNE SYSTEM ATTACKS THE NEW ONE</li>
</ol>

<p>The other most common reason this approach has failed is graft-versus-host disease.</p>

<p>That is when the patient's immune system tries to attack the incoming, replacement immune system, causing a fatal reaction in most. </p>

<ol start="4">
<li>UNKNOWN QUANTITIES</li>
</ol>

<p>Interestingly, both the Berlin patient and the London patient experienced complications that are normally lethal in most other cases. </p>

<p>And experts believe that those complications helped their cases. </p>

<p>Timothy Ray Brown, the Berlin patient, had both - his cancer returned and he developed graft-versus-host disease, putting him in a coma and requiring a second bone marrow transplant. </p>

<p>The London patient had one: he suffered graft-versus-host disease. </p>

<p>Against the odds, they both survived, HIV-free.</p>

<p>Some believe that, ironically, graft-versus-host disease might have helped both of them to further obliterate their HIV. </p>

<p>But there is no way to control or replicate that safely. </p>
