<p>But the 45-year-old put Apple and Google to the test on Monday when she tried to decide which is better: Siri or Google Assistant. </p>

<p>Jackie, co-host Kyle Sandilands and executive producer Sonia 'Palestine' Jahshan tested the voice assistant features offered by each tech giant. </p>

<p>Siri or Google Assistant? Radio hosts Kyle Sandilands (left) and Jackie 'O' Henderson (right) put Apple and Google's virtual assistants to the test on Monday</p>

<p>In a video shared to TikTok, Jackie used Siri on her iPhone, but the software was unable to understand the first question.</p>

<p>'What is Kyle Sandilands' middle name?' Jackie asked Siri.</p>

<p>The answer is Dalton, but the voice assistant ignored the question and suggested something else instead.</p>

<p>Not a great start! In a video shared to TikTok, Jackie used Siri on her iPhone, but the software was unable to understand the first question: 'What is Kyle Sandilands' middle name?'</p>

<p>'What would you like to know about Kyle Sandilands?' Siri asked </p>

<p>'What is his middle name?' Jackie asked again, but Siri repeated: 'What would you like to know about Kyle Sandilands?'</p>

<p>Kyle became frustrated with Siri, saying: 'This b***h is dumb. I'm telling ya!' </p>

<p>It's a winner! KIIS FM producer Sonia 'Palestine' Jahshan then asked the same question to Google Assistant, which replied: 'Kyle Sandilands' full name is Kyle Dalton Sandilands'</p>

<p>Sonia then asked the same question to Google Assistant.</p>

<p>'Kyle Sandilands' full name is Kyle Dalton Sandilands,' the digital assistant replied, which prompted cheers in the studio. </p>

<p>Jackie then tried to use Siri again, asking: 'What noise does a kookaburra make?'</p>

<p>Siri replied: 'Okay, I found something on the web for what noise does a kookaburra make.'</p>

<p>Get to the point! Siri once again failed to provide a straightforward answer to 'What noise does a kookaburra make?'</p>

<p>The same question was asked of Google Assistant, which replied by making the correct animal noise.</p>

<p>Jackie, however, couldn't be turned off Apple. </p>

<p>'Okay, but I'll stick with Apple because hey,' Jackie said, to which Kyle replied: 'Everything else in your life isn't working. So why should the iPhone?'</p>

<p>Star of the show: The lighthearted segment comes after Jackie was forced to self-isolate in Melbourne for a fortnight after a COVID-19 outbreak on set of The Masked Singer</p>

<p>The lighthearted segment comes after Jackie was forced to self-isolate in Melbourne for a fortnight after a COVID-19 outbreak on set of The Masked Singer.</p>

<p>The radio star was almost required to do four weeks of hotel quarantine, but instead was allowed to do two weeks in Melbourne before returning to Sydney without the need to self-isolate.</p>

<p>She told the Adelaide Advertiser: 'I knew it wasn't going to be fun because after the two weeks already doing the quarantine in Melbourne, that was mentally enough.'</p>
