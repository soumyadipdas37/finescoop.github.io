<p>Stocky and quick, Quaison's goalscoring threat and dribbling ability has drawn attention from top clubs in Europe including Tottenham. </p>

<p>Burnley are making an £8million move for Mainz attacking midfielder Robin Quaison</p>

<p>The 26-year-old Sweden international can also play as a second striker or on the wing</p>

<p>He has a buy out clause understood to be around £14m but Burnley will test the water to see if Mainz are willing to take a lower offer.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Burnley are braced for another bid from West Ham for James Tarkowski. West Ham have had two offers rejected so far, the last at £24m rising to just under £30m. </p>

<p>They have received enough encouragement to believe a deal could be reached but Burnley have to pay a sell-on to Brentford and find a suitable replacement. </p>

<p>He has a buy out clause understood to be around £14m and scored 13 league goals last term</p>

<p>They have considered Nottingham Forest's Joe Worrall but he is valued at £12m and they did not wish to pay more than £6m.</p>

<p>It's also understood that any potential sale will include a 27.5 per cent sell-on fee to Brentford of any profit on the £3.5m Burnley paid for the 27-year-old Tarkowski in 2016.</p>
