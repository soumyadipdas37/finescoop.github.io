<p>Sunny with a chance of DEATH: Weekend Sunrise landed itself in hot water with Adelaide viewers on Sunday morning after predicting temperatures of 158 degrees. Pictured: Weekend Sunrise hosts Monique Wright and Matt Doran </p>

<p>Presumably the network meant to report temperatures highs of 18° - which would have been correct. </p>

<p>It's not the first time Weekend Sunrise has suffered an on-air faux pas.  </p>

<p>Not again! In May, Weekend Sunrise host Matt Doran (pictured) was left confused after a major technical fail almost ended the show </p>

<p>After Matt threw to reporter Sarah Greenhalgh in Italy, the screen suddenly switched to Sportsbet's Inside Trading show hosted by Simon Marshall. </p>

<p>The show immediately cut back to the newsroom and Matt said: 'Sarah Greenhalgh reporting there and let's get some more news now with Sally.'</p>
