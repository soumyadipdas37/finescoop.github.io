<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An animal lover has come up with an ingenious 'hedgehog hack' after spotting one of the creatures falling down her garden steps.</p>

<p>Agata Majcher, 38, a make-up artist from Edinburgh, Scotland, filmed adorable footage of a prickly creature successfully scaling the steps after she used discarded bricks to create their own mini-stairway.</p>

<p>Ms Majcher, who was able to create the animal-friendly stairs with the help fo her boyfriend Stewart Rugg, 37, has since been hailed a 'genius' for her invention.</p>

<p>Agata Majcher, 38, from Edinburgh, Scotland, decided to create the mini-staircase after spotting one of the creatures falling down her garden steps</p>

<p>During the clip, the hedgehog uses the discarded bricks placed along the side of the staircase to carefully climb each step before wandering into Ms Majcher's garden.      </p>

<p>Ms Majcher said: 'I saw on my CCTV camera how a hedgehog was going upstairs, but the poor thing fell down from the first step.</p>

<p>'It was heartbreaking seeing that they might get hurt in my garden by falling down the stairs - I was angry at myself that I'd never thought about it before.</p>

<p>'I said to my boyfriend ''we need to do something to help them'', so he broke a couple of bricks and we put them on the steps.</p>

<p>'I've seen them use the steps many times - I just found it so cute and thought other ''hedgehog people'' would think the same.</p>

<p>'And maybe others would see it and realise they're not just little spikey creatures, but they're smart, cute and in need of some support from us.'</p>

<p>Ms Majcher first took an interest in hedgehogs when she sensed they were visiting her garden but waited more than a month for the creatures to appear.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I kept telling my boyfriend that we had hedgehogs in our garden as there were no snails, and they were always a nightmare eating my precious plants.</p>

<p>Ms Majcher now uses a trail camera at night to film the hedgehogs using her garden as a safe haven</p>

<p>Ms Majcher and her boyfriend Stewart Rugg (pictured together), 37, placed the bricks on their garden steps after seeing one of the creatures fall</p>

<p>'But I never saw any hedgehogs - they were always ''exotic'' for me and masters of hiding from humans.</p>

<p>'One evening the motion sensor light in the garden stayed on for a long time, so I went to the window to see what was there and I saw it.</p>

<p>'The poor little thing was so wobbly, so I ran outside with water and cat food bowls, and it was crunching and drinking for a very long time - I even had to protect it from a mean fox.</p>

<p>'The same thing happened the night after, so I've created a small feeding station and moved my CCTV camera from the kitchen window into the living room to watch what is happening every night.'</p>

<p>The make-up artist now spends around 45 minutes each evening tending to the hedgehogs by cleaning their bowls and ensuring they have a fresh supply of food and water.</p>

<p>She said: 'If it's nice weather I then wait for the first visitor, and if it rains I go back inside and wait for a notification from the camera.</p>

<p>'The hedgehogs are comfortable around me when I pop outside - I can come close to them, but I would never touch them.</p>

<p>The animal lover enjoys watching the hedgehogs so much that she has invested £60 in a new trail camera</p>

<p>Ms Majcher said her pet cat Bobo loves watching videos from trail cameras on Youtube</p>

<p>'Some nights get really busy with between six to eight hedgehogs, other nights there's only two.</p>

<p>'Bobo [pet cat] loves watching videos from trail cameras on Youtube, but when the cats see hedgehogs outside they run like crazy from window to window.</p>

<p>'After a couple of months of taking notes I know roughly who comes when.</p>

<p>'Then I go to sleep and check my camera in the morning as all the best stuff happens at night.'</p>

<p>Ms Majcher has enjoyed observing the hedgehogs so much that she has invested £60 in a new trail camera - and has said she will be doing as much as she can to help her new garden visitors.</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm all animals lover - I find everything fluffy or spikey super cute.' </p>

<p>Ms Majcher has been praised on social media for her staircase hack, with some calling her a 'genius'</p>

<p>After sharing her video online in an effort to encourage more to lend their time to the vulnerable species, Ms Majcher has been met with a flurry of praise.</p>

<p>One user wrote: 'That's genius, both the thought of the bricks and the fact that he/she knows to use them.'</p>

<p>While another person commented: 'Smartie, is someone asks how to make a garden hedgehog friendly here's one more thing (bricks on steps).'</p>

<p>Another person added: 'Love this.'</p>
