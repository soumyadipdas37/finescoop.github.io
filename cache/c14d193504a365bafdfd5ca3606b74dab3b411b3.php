<p>The celebrity TV chef, 53, is the director of Gordon Ramsay Restaurants Ltd which includes eateries such as his three Michelin star Restaurant Gordon Ramsay.</p>

<p>A report filed to Companies House now shows that the chef didn't take any director's dividend from the profits which totalled £11.9m last year, reports The Sun.   </p>

<p>Boss: Gordon Ramsay worked for free last year after deciding not to take any salary from his own company's profits</p>

<p>Gordon's company has an interest in fourteen London based restaurants and also has licence agreements for 10 others around the world.</p>

<p>These include his three Michelin star Restaurant Godon Ramsay and the one Michelein star Petrus, as well as the Savoy Grill and Lucky Cat by Gordon Ramsay.</p>

<p>The report also revealed that Gordon is planning on opening up to 50 sites over the next five years in the UK as well as 200 in Asia.</p>

<p>One of the ventures named is the Gordon Ramsay Pub &amp; Grill in Macau, with the report suggesting that this should be open in the autumn of 2020.</p>

<p>And determined to make the most out of his business, Gordon is also set to launch an Academy to develop young chefs’ skills and passion.     </p>

<p>The chef has an estimated worth of £200million and Gordon began reopening the first of his 35 restaurants in July after the business struggled during the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>However his ambitions to 'create a billion-dollar dining proposition' are undented by the Covid-19 pandemic that has devastated much of the hospitality trade. </p>

<p>Gordon believes the new restaurants will create around 2,000 jobs in the UK including some in head office. </p>

<p>'We have big dreams, big plans and a global strategy so ambitious it takes my breath away,' he has previously said. 'We have had to acknowledge and review the impact of the horrendous coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>'We continue to be optimistic and ambitious, knowing it is more important than ever before to invest in our industry, to support suppliers and to create jobs.'</p>

<p>Gordon Ramsay Holdings said: 'GRNA (Gordon Ramsay North America) has exclusive rights to develop Gordon Ramsay branded restaurants in North America, Canada and the Caribbean where it has plans to open up to 200 restaurants as well as continuing to grow its very successful licence business with other partners.</p>

<p>Getting back on track: The TV chef began reopening the first of his 35 restaurants in July after the business struggled during the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>'The pandemic has had a significant impact on the group. It is difficult to estimate how the outbreak will impact trading and for how long and the directors consider this as a level of uncertainty over which they have no control.' </p>

<p>Despite the coronavirus, Gordon intends to launch a new 'Street Burger' outlet this winter, which will be modelled on his £15 all-you-can-eat Street Pizza brand.</p>

<p>A second Hell's Kitchen is opening in Dubai – the first is in Las Vegas – and a Pub and Grill is scheduled to open in Macau in the autumn. </p>

<p>While back in May, The Sun reported Ramsay had taken out loans with Barclays against 16 companies, which includes those managing some of his Michelin star outlets.</p>

<p>The loans were intended to provide a lifeline to companies which manage some of the TV chef's flagship eateries, such as London's Savoy Grill and Petrus. </p>

<p>Gordon prompted outrage by reportedly using the government's taxpayer funded furlough scheme to pay 500 workers sacked from his restaurants in March as the hospitality industry ground to a halt.</p>

<p>It is understood that some of the workers made redundant by Ramsay are being paid via the furlough scheme that is estimated to cost the government around £80bn of taxpayers' money. </p>

<p>The lockdown led Ramsay to lay off 500 employees in March, with no guarantee their jobs would be safe in the future.</p>

<p>Chefs, waiters and other staff were called to a meeting and told their contracts were being terminated - rather than being furloughed on 80 per cent pay.</p>
