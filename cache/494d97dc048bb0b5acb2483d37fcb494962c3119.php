<p>Tesla's new Model Y vehicle costs more than $52,000, but it seems the firm 'made a run to Home Depot' for some the vehicle's parts. Images of the car's cooling system surfaced online showing the structure is patched by faux wood trim</p>

<p>Tesla first unveiled its Model Y last year and began shipping the vehicle to customers this past March.</p>

<p>The car seats seven adults, with an option third row in the back, and is said to go from zero to 60 miles per hour in just 3.5 seconds.</p>

<p>The starting price for this vehicle is $52,900, which frustrates those owners who opened the hood to see the fake wooden trim around the cooling system.</p>

<p>Someone made a run to Home Depot to make Q2 numbers,' a Tesla Motors Club forum user joked in the original thread.</p>

<p>The discovery was made by one owner who disassembled the Model Y to fix an issue, but spotted the DIY molding when they reached the Liquid Cooled Condenser (LCC) - and similar photos from other buyers were shared shortly after</p>

<p>Some of the cooling systems were patched with plain white plastic trim</p>

<p>According to The Drive, the setup of the trim on the cooling system seems to provide strain relief for the strap holding it in place.</p>

<p>Electrek reported in June that after Tesla reopened its Fermont factor in California Model Y buyers have not been happy with their newly shipped vehicle.</p>

<p>Buyers told Electrek that their delivery was set end of June, but Tesla shared an update that orders were delayed due to defects.</p>

<p>CEO Elon Musk said that minimizing rectifications in Model Y production is a top priority in an email to employees: 'It is extremely important for us to ramp up Model Y production and minimize rectification needs. I want you to know that it really makes a difference to Tesla right now.'</p>
