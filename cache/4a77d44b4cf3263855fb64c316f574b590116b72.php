<p>Get busy: In footage posted to Matty's Instagram, the couple proved they're partial to a dance with children's supergroup, The Wiggles.</p>

<p>'It's time for bed,' he told Marlie-Mae, before sitting down to watch the TV. </p>

<p>He then appeared to get entranced by the song Vegan Hot Dog with him doing the dance moves in his living room. </p>

<p>At that moment, Laura walks in and recognises the song and says: 'Oh, Vegan Hot Dog' as the pair dance in their living room.  </p>

<p>'Vegan Hot Dog...gets me every time,' Matty captioned the clip. </p>

<p>The skit comes after the young parents rejoiced in enjoying a child-free night at upscale restaurant Catalina At Rose Bay last month.   </p>

<p>'The faces you make when Nana comes to babysit,' she wrote in the caption.     </p>

<p>Date night! Matty J and Laura enjoyed a child-free date night out at the Catalina Restaurant in Rose Bay last month</p>

<p>Matty also shared a photo of himself making a funny face as he embraced a beaming Laura. </p>

<p>'This is what [Laura] gets when she asks for a nice photo,' he joked in the caption. </p>

<p>The Bachelor couple's date night out comes after Laura revealed she was offered money to marry an Italian student so he could get his permanent visa and stay in Australia. </p>

<p>Cheeky: Matty also shared a photo of himself making a funny face as he embraced a beaming Laura. 'This is what Laura gets when she asks for a nice photo,' he joked in the caption</p>

<p>She explained on her podcast Life Uncut that an ex-boyfriend had asked her if she would consider marrying one of his friends so he could continue living in Australia. </p>

<p>'This Italian guy had approached my ex-boyfriend at the time and was like 'hey, how would you feel if I pay you a certain amount of money, and I marry Laura to get permanent residency?' </p>

<p>She recalled that her boyfriend asked how would she feel about doing it, 'I was like, 'not good, not good,'' Laura said, laughing at the absurdity of the situation. </p>

<p>Fortunately, she never followed through with the offer, as marrying someone in order to get permanent residency carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison and/or a fine of up to $100,000 in Australia.   </p>

<p>'It was all very dodgy!' The Bachelor couple's date night out comes after Laura revealed one of her ex boyfriend's friends - an Italian man - asked if he could marry her so he could stay in Australia. Fortunately, the brunette beauty never followed through with the offer</p>
