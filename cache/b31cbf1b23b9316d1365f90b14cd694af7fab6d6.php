<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Bank of England is ready to 'go big and go fast' should a second wave of coronavirus cause more economic turmoil, governor Andrew Bailey has said.</p>

<p>As sterling edged above $1.33 for the first time this year to its highest level since early 2018, Bailey said the central bank would act 'decisively' to pump more money into the economy if needed.</p>

<p>Bailey, who took over as governor as the coronavirus pandemic struck, insisted the Bank still has enough 'firepower' to support the economy through further troubles – which could include deploying negative interest rates.</p>

<p>Andrew Bailey said the central bank would act 'decisively' to pump more money into the economy if needed</p>

<p>This would effectively mean that companies and individuals would pay banks to hold on to their money, but would be paid to borrow, encouraging them to spend rather than save. </p>

<p>Bailey also said the Bank was ready to buy more corporate debt if necessary, further stimulating the economy by supporting firms which needed to borrow money.</p>

<p>He said: 'We are not out of firepower by any means, and to be honest it looks from today's vantage point that we were too cautious about our remaining firepower pre-Covid.'</p>

<p>David Madden, an analyst at CMC markets, said: 'The extra stimulus will be called upon when the furlough scheme comes to an end in late October.'</p>

<p>The Bank of England has already announced an unprecedented stimulus package in the face of a record slump in economic activity during lockdown. </p>

<p>The pound edged above $1.33 for the first time this year to its highest level since early 2018</p>

<p>It has cut interest rates to a historic low of 0.1 per cent, and announced it would buy £300billion of Government bonds this year.</p>

<p>Bailey – speaking at the Jackson Hole symposium of central bankers, usually held in Wyoming but staged virtually this year due to the pandemic – added that he wanted 'to ensure there is sufficient headroom' for a big bond-buying programme 'when needed in the future – to 'go big' and 'go fast' decisively.'</p>

<p>He conceded this could be a challenge over the long term, given the rapid bond-buying which the Bank has undertaken so far this year and the need to eventually sell those assets off again.</p>

<p>But at the moment, he said, there was a large stock of Government bonds for the central bank to purchase and it could broaden the types of financial assets it buys.</p>

<p>Bailey's speech came after the US central bank, the Federal Reserve said it would now tolerate a higher rate as it warned of the 'serious risks' which low inflation posed. For decades the Fed has targetted an inflation rate of 2 per cent, which is also the Bank of England's target.</p>

<p>The move paves the way for global interest rates to stay lower for longer.</p>
