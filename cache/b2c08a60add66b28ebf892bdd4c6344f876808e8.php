<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Uber has kept its licence to operate in London following a court ruling today despite a magistrate criticising 'historical failings' by the ride-hailing service.</p>

<p>Deputy chief magistrate Tan Ikram allowed its appeal against Transport for London's refusal to renew its operating licence after it was removed due to safety concerns.</p>

<p>He declared that it was a 'fit and proper' company to operate minicabs in the capital, following a four-day hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier this month.</p>

<p>Uber had been allowed to continue operating in London until the appeal was completed (file)</p>

<p>TfL had rejected Uber's application for a new London licence in November 2019, due to 'several breaches that placed passengers and their safety at risk'.</p>

<p>It found a change to Uber's systems had allowed unauthorised people to upload their photos to legitimate driver accounts, enabling them to pick up passengers.</p>

<p>Uber, which is based in San Francisco, California, had been allowed to continue operating in London until the appeal process was completed.</p>

<p>The company was previously granted a short-term licence by a judge in 2018, following TfL's decision not to renew its licence in September 2017.</p>

<p>Uber argued that it since assuaged concerns over insurance verification and driver identification since TfL refused to grant it a new licence last year.Â </p>
