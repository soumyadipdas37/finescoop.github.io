<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>PSG winger Angel Di Maria could face a lengthy ban after fresh footage emerged of him spitting towards Marseille defender Alvaro Gonzalez.Â </p>

<p>Gonzalez was at the heart of the mass brawl after which five players were sent offÂ during PSG's defeat to Marseille at the Parc des Princes on Sunday.Â </p>

<p>He was accused by NeymarÂ of called him a 'monkey motherf*****' but Marseille boss Andre Villas-Boas defended his player, saying he is not a racist before going on to allege that Di Maria spat at the centre-back.Â Â </p>

<p>Fresh footage shows that Angel Di Maria did spit in the direction of Alvaro Gonzalez</p>

<p>The Marseille player was himself accused of racism and also faces a ban if it is proven</p>

<p>And now fresh footage has emerged supporting the Portuguese's sensational post-match accusation.Â </p>

<p>In the clip shown byÂ TÃ©lÃ©foot channel on Tuesday evening, slow motion footage displays Di Maria spitting in the direction of Gonzalez as he jogs away.Â </p>

<p>Gonzalez looks furious and shouts after the Argentine in response. The video is paused and circled when Di Maria turns his head and spits.Â </p>

<p>Pascal Garibian, technical director of refereeing, explained after the game that VAR had not found images to validate the accusations of spitting.Â </p>

<p>He said: 'This was the subject of a search by video support at that minute and we couldn't find any images to support this fact. That doesn't mean it didn't happen, but there is no video image which in a convincing manner could support this precise point.'</p>

<p>Neymar was sent off for punching Gonzalez, who he accused of saying 'monkey motherf*****'</p>

<p>With the emergence of the fresh footage a disciplinary committee of Ligue 1 is likely to investigate and Di Maria would face a ban of up to six matches.Â </p>

<p>Clearly, spitting is a serious breach of coronavirus protocol and given the current climate, the Argentine may yet face more serious sanctions.Â </p>

<p>Di Maria is not the only one staring down the barrel of a lengthy suspension.Â Â </p>

<p>The tension overflowed in the derby clash when NeymarÂ was infuriated with the comments he alleges the Spaniard made, which resulted in the Brazilian throwing a punch at his rival and subsequently being sent off.</p>

<p>After the game he wrote a lengthy statement on his Instagram, which read: 'In our sport, aggressions, insults, swearing are part of the game, of the dispute. You can't be affectionate. I understand this guy partly. All is a part of the game but racism and intolerance are unacceptable.</p>

<p>Di Maria and Gonzalez both face bans for separate incidents in Marseille's 1-0 victory</p>

<p>'I am black, son of black, grandson and great grandson of black also. I am proud and I do not see myself as different from anyone. Yesterday I wanted those in charge of the game (referees, assistants) to position themselves impartially and understand that there is no longer such a place for a prejudiced attitude.</p>

<p>'Reflecting and seeing all the manifestation that happened. I am saddened by the feeling of hatred that we can provoke when in the heat of the moment we snap.</p>

<p>'Should I have ignored it? I don't know yet... Today, with a cool head, I say yes, But in due course my companions and I asked the referees for help and we were ignored. That's the point!</p>

<p>'We who are involved in entertainment need to reflect. An action led to a reaction and got to where it did. I accept my punishment because I should have followed the path of clean football.</p>

<p>The Brazilian was one of five players shown red cards for their part in the brawl on SundayÂ </p>

<p>'Racism exists. It exists. But we have to stop it. No more, enough!'Â </p>

<p>The governing body of professional football inÂ France, the LFP, will now review the incident before handing out its suspension for the Brazilian, who could be banned for as many as seven matches if guilty, according to French sports outlet RMC Sport.Â </p>

<p>They are also investigating the claims made about Gonzalez, and if he is found guilty of racism he could face up to a ten-game ban.Â Â </p>
