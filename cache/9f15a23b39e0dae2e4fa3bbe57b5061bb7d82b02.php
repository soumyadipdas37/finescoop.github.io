<p>Brunette beauty: Irina wore her glossy brunette locks in loose waves, whilst she accessorised with a delicate gold necklace and shades</p>

<p>Loving life: Irina seemed in high spirits as she headed on a girls' day out in the city</p>

<p>Irina may have been enjoying a day out with her friend, but she raised eyebrows earlier in the week when she was spotted out with her ex, Bradley Cooper.</p>

<p>The couple amicably co-parent daughter Lea, but had not been pictured together in public for more than a year.  </p>

<p>The former power couple started dating in April 2015 when they attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, went official in March 2016 during a Paris Fashion Week party, welcomed Lea in March 2017 and split in June 2019.</p>

<p>But she noted that she appreciated their union.</p>

<p>'I think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other,' continued the model. 'Life without B is new ground.'</p>
