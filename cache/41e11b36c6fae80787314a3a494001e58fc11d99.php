<p>Mr Matthews described the sales process as 'long and emotional' and revealed he had to leave his job to keep up with the demands.</p>

<p>'There were lots of meetings to be at and big decisions to make, it just got too hard to juggle a job on top,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.</p>

<p>'I felt like I was letting work down and had to put my personal life first.' </p>

<p>He told the publication that he is looking forward to possibly starting his own business.</p>
