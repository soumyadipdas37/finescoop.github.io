<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sickening footage has emerged online of a man reducing a little girl to tears after telling her Muslim mother to 'go back to Saudi Arabia'.</p>

<p>The unnamed elderly male was filmed by the victim launching a foul-mouthed Islamophobic rant after he allegedly spotted her wearing a hijab at a bus stop in Bexleyheath, south east London.</p>

<p>When she tried to ignore him, he involved the woman's young daughter and said 'your mum's wrapped up like a turkey' - making her cry.</p>

<p>Despite the child's obvious distress, he continued his hateful tirade and said Muslims did not belong in the UK before telling the woman to 'f*** off'.</p>

<p>The unnamed elderly male was filmed by the victim launching a foul-mouthed Islamophobic rant after he allegedly spotted her wearing a hijab at a bus stop in Bexleyheath, London</p>

<p>The vile abuse was finally stopped when two bus drivers and a fellow commuter stepped in to defend the victims.</p>

<p>Video posted on social media yesterday shows the elderly suspect apparently waiting for a bus before spotting the unidentified victim with her little girl and approaching them.</p>

<p>He says: 'I believe it is Saudi Arabia. If you contradict the government they cut your head off. Would you like to live there, where they do that - cut your head off if you disagree with them?'</p>

<p>Despite the child's obvious distress, he continued his hateful tirade and said Muslims did not belong in the UK before telling the woman to 'f*** off'. Pictured, the mother consoled her young daughter</p>

<p>When the woman refuses to answer, he tells her little girl: 'Your mum's wrapped up like a turkey.'</p>

<p>The horrified mother then calls him a 'crazy man' to which he replies 'you what?' and walks towards her.</p>

<p>She tells him not to talk to her like that but he shouts in her face: 'Go back to Saudi Arabia. Muslims don't belong here. F*** off.'</p>

<p>A second clip shows the little girl sobbing while her mother hugs her and pleads with her to stop - while the abuser looks on remorseless.</p>

<p>A third clip shows the suspect being confronted over his actions by two bus drivers wearing high-vis jackets - as the little girl continues to cry in the background</p>

<p>Looking for support, he turns to another commuter and says: 'F*** me, she's talking and now here she's crying.'</p>

<p>But the man replies bluntly: 'Mate, you've made her girl cry.'</p>

<p>One of the drivers accuses him of giving the victim 'a load of abuse' but he screams 'she shouldn't be here' before storming off mid-rant.</p>

<p>The Metropolitan Police and Transport for London have been approached for comment.</p>
