<p>The Queen's eldest granddaughter, 39, sported a blue long-sleeved top, matching hat and white riding slacks which she paired with black boots.</p>

<p>The royal, who won a Silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics, was competing in the cross country section on the final day of the trials.</p>

<p>Sticking to a regal look, Princess Anne's daughter wore minimal make-up, and tied her long blonde hair up under her helmet.</p>

<p>Zara Tindall had her game-face on as she rode her new mare Happenstance at the Cornbury International horse trials in Oxfordshire</p>

<p>The former Equestrian World Champion looked at home atop her stunning black and white horse, a mare she first rode last month.</p>

<p>The event - which started on Friday - did offer the mother-of-two some down time as she was pictured looking relaxed and cheerful while walking one of the family's dogs on a lead.</p>

<p>She wore a blue polo-neck t-shirt and jeans and had her blonde tresses tucked away and styled with a dark-blue cap. </p>

<p>Other pictures showed Zara intently watching the show jumping with her groom Jason Wood.</p>

<p>Zara also competed on Happenstance on Friday for the dressage test. She then rode on horses Classicals Euro Star and Showtime on Saturday.</p>

<p>It comes after Zara and her former Rugby pro husband Mike Tindall both tested negative for Covid-19.</p>

<p>The couple, who have spent lockdown at their home on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Estate, were filmed taking the tests at the stables on their farm in Gloucestershire. </p>

<p>Zara was pictured walking on of the family's dogs on a lead during the last day of the Cornbury International horse trials</p>

<p>Both were relieved the tests came back negative, and the Tindalls are believed to have since travelled to Balmoral to see the Queen.</p>

<p>Zara and Mike took the BioSure tests in their role as ambassadors for Manchester-based cyber technology company VST Enterprises.</p>

<p>They then uploaded their results onto their VHealth Passport - which has been developed to help get sports fans back into major events and stadiums - where they appeared within seconds.</p>

<p>Zara winced as the pin-prick test was administered, which detects coronavirus antibodies and was performed under Covid-19 safe practice by Latus Health Care. </p>

<p>The couple are taking part in a pilot scheme called FANS ARE BACK, which is being put to the government to get football, snooker, rugby, golf and equestrian sports fans back into stadiums and major sporting events next month.</p>
