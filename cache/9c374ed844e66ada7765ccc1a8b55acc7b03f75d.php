<p>Heartbreaking: Travel agent Kate Harris who has run her own award-winning business, Inspired Travel, for 20 years says the Covid crisis has seen her applying for jobs to stack shelves as bookings have dried up</p>

<p>Speaking in a webcast with Travel Weekly, she told Editor-in-chief Lucy Huxley, pictured top left, that she doesn't know what she'd do if she lost her shop - and wonders whether all the sacrifices she's made along the way are now worth it</p>

<p>Harris told the webcast that she didn't want to be a 'moaner' and was working hard to get a second job to support her business</p>

<p>Getting emotional, she told Huxley in the 'heartbreaking' interview that she already owed £10,000 and is behind on the company's corporation tax and VAT bills.</p>

<p>She said she'd been left wondering whether all the sacrifices she's made along the way, including years when she says she was a 'drive-by mother', to run her own business have been worth it.</p>

<p>The company director struggled not to cry as she revealed recent interviews she's had, saying: 'I did a Zoom interview for a job with two people who are younger than my 27-year-old son. I’m answering questions like a manager when I’m applying to stack shelves.</p>

<p>'I never wanted to do that [but] this has been my life and I will do whatever it takes to save my business.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I think if the choice was between having Covid or a roof over my head I’d pick Covid every day because without my job, without this shop to come to I don’t know what I’d do anymore.'  </p>

<p>Huxley later tweeted the webcast, saying it was 'utterly heartbreaking'. </p>

<p>Editor-in-chief of Travel Weekly, Lucy Huxley, warned there'll be many more agents facing the same trials as Kate</p>

<p>She wrote: 'If you do one thing today...watch the raw emotion displayed by agent Kate Harris of Inspired Travel on this webcast about the Chancellor’s Job Support Scheme &amp; more. There will be many more agents just like Kate. #SaveFutureTravel' </p>

<p>Another agent painted a similar picture of her own business, <?php echo e('@'); ?>julie_travel wrote: 'This is the reality of what is happening to previously successful travel businesses. I don't have premises but haven’t earned a penny since March and now looking at a raft of Lapland bookings possibly cancelling. It’s heartbreaking.' </p>

<p>Harris said she'd hoped in March to back 'up and running' by August but was now hoping for a surge in bookings next spring instead. </p>
