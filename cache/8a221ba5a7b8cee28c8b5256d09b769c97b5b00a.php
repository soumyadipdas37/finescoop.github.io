<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An off-road buggy attempted to climb an extremely steep hill and failed - coming crashing down towards the spectators below.</p>

<p>The terrifying incident took place on a dirt trail in Wellsville, Ohio, on September 26.  </p>

<p>An off-road buggy driver in Wellsville, Ohio had a lucky escape when his vehicle failed to make it up a steep hill and came crashing down, rolling towards the spectators below</p>

<p>The footage shows the orange off-road buggy take a roaring start towards the steep hill as it attempts to climb it.</p>

<p>A number of spectators stand around the bottom of the hill filming the attempt.</p>

<p>The vehicle accelerates up the hill bumping over the dirt track until it veers over to the left.</p>

<p>The off-road buggy loses momentum and eventually gives out and the driver loses control as it comes crashing down the hill. </p>

<p>It barrel rolls over and over again with scraps of metal flying off as it heads towards the spectators at the bottom of the hill.  </p>

<p>One woman in green narrowly escapes the heavy vehicle thundering towards her as she runs out of its path just in time</p>

<p>Three of the four spectators closest to the path of the falling buggy run out of the way but one woman wearing a green t-shirt sits frozen on a log.</p>

<p>At the last minute, she gets up and runs as the buggy crashes to a stop, narrowly missing her. </p>

<p>By-standers come running over to help the driver of the vehicle who gives them a thumbs up indicating that he is okay.</p>

<p>'He's good, he's good,' says a shocked onlooker. 'Holy f***'s sake'.</p>

<p>The buggy driver survives the crash unharmed and gives the spectators a thumbs up indicating that he is okay - but his vehicle is badly damaged</p>

<p>Although the lucky driver survived the crash unharmed, his vehicle was visibly wrecked.</p>

<p>The person who filmed the footage said: 'We were out on the trails and we came upon a guy who wanted to climb the biggest meanest hill there and he tried and failed horribly. </p>

<p>'We helped him get his gear and rig out of woods. He was thankful.' </p>

<p>The twisty terrain and hill climbs are sought out by thrill-seekers but the leaves, mud and rocks on the trails can make a hill climb extremely dangerous.</p>
