<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An 'unacceptable' number of people are overloading the UK's coronavirus testing system by asking for a test when they don't have symptoms, the health secretary has said.</p>

<p>Matt Hancock warned there has been a 25 per cent spike in requests from those without symptoms, meaning many who need them cannot get tests.</p>

<p>'Of people who got symptoms, 92 per cent got a test within ten miles of (their home),' he told the Today programme.</p>

<p>'The reason we have constraints at the moment is not because capacity has gone down, it's because demand has gone up.</p>

<p>'For instance, I've heard stories of whole schools been told to get a test and all pupils. That is not what testing is there for.'</p>

<p>Hancock also said he'd heard of cases of people requesting coronavirus tests because they were going on holiday and wanted to find out whether they had the virus.</p>

<p>Testing capacity has recently been cranked up across the UK to 'record highs' but it is still meant to only be available for people who have coronavirus symptoms.</p>

<p>MailOnline found that it was possible to order a coronavirus test, even if you didn't have coronavirus symptoms, by filling in a request form online saying that you'd been asked to take one. </p>

<p>There was no option to say that you had been asked to get a test by your school, or that you had no symptoms but were concerned. </p>

<p>Matt Hancock said coronavirus testing capacity was at risk due to people requesting tests who do not have symptoms</p>

<p>The coronavirus test ordering system does not give users the option to say they are ordering a test because they are concerned</p>

<p>Deflecting allegations that the UK's testing system is failing, Hancock said that they were carrying out a record number of tests that keeps rising.</p>

<p>'Even on antigen testing we have record capacity,' he said. 'It's higher than it was last week.'</p>

<p>He laid the blame for people being directed hundreds of miles from their homes at the door of those who have requested a test but do not have symptoms.</p>

<p>'We have got the vast majority getting tests locally, and results quickly,' he said. 'But this increase in demand is a problem and it restricts the number of tests available.'</p>

<p>The director of testing, Sarah-Jane Marsh, yesterday apologised to those who were not getting tests and warned they were at a 'critical pinch-point'.</p>

<p>'Can I please offer my heartfelt apologies to anyone who cannot get a Covid test at present,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowde3d, it's our laboratory processing that is the critical pinch-point.</p>

<p>'We are doing all we can to expand quickly.'</p>

<p>Ms Marsh said there is capacity at testing sites but laboratories processing the tests are at a 'critical pinch-point'</p>

<p>An NHS Test and Trace worker sorts through coronavirus tests at a drive-through testing facility in Bolton</p>

<p>Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition, yesterday said that the test and trace system was 'failing'.</p>

<p>The number of new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK remained above 2,000 for the third day in a row yesterday.</p>

<p>In response, the government announced people will only be able to meet in groups of up to six people in England from Monday.</p>

<p>They said there was a delay in implementing the rules to give everyone time to read them and acknowledge them. </p>
