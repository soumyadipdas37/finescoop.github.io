<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian motorists will now pay a heavy price if they are caught using their mobile phone behind the wheel. </p>

<p>From midnight on Monday fines more than doubled in Western Australia, with drivers now facing a $1,000 penalty if they are caught messaging or using video chat.  </p>

<p>The new legislation is a $600 increase from the previous penalty and four demerit points will also be deducted.</p>

<p>However, those caught touching their phone at the lights or holding it to make a voice call will be hit with a $500 fine and a loss of three demerit points.</p>

<p>From midnight on Monday fines more than doubled in Western Australia, with drivers now facing a $1,000 penalty if they are caught messaging or using video chat (stock image) </p>

<p>Western Australian drivers are still legally allowed to answer calls but only if their phone is securely mounted to the vehicle.</p>

<p>The WA Road Safety Commission said the state government chose to increase the fines after almost 12,000 residents were caught using their phone behind the wheel last year.</p>

<p>'Inattention as a factor in fatalities in WA has increased in recent years, with 31 fatalities (19 per cent) recorded in inattention related crashes in 2019,' it said.</p>

<p>'This was a 48 per cent increase compared to the preceding five-year average of 21.</p>

<p>'The new penalties are some of the toughest in Australia, to deter drivers from reaching for the phone while driving putting themselves and other road users at risk.'</p>

<p>But the opposition hit back claiming the different fines were confusing.</p>

<p>Shadow Minister for Police Peter Katsambanis said 'one simple message and one simple penalty' is needed. </p>

<p>The new legislation is a $600 increase from the previous penalty and four demerit points will also be deducted</p>

<p>'The government's two-tiered approach is going to add more confusion,' he said. </p>

<p>The new penalties are now matched with Queensland, with the two states now sharing the toughest mobile phone laws in the country.</p>

<p>In February Queensland introduced a new law that upped fines to $1,000 with a loss of four demerit points.</p>

<p>Anyone in the Sunshine State caught using their phone twice in one year will be at risk of losing their license.</p>

<p>However, those caught touching their phone at the lights or holding it to make a voice call will be hit with a $500 fine and a loss of three demerit points</p>

<p>The penalty for using a phone while driving is $337 and five demerits in New South Wales, while in South Australian drivers are slapped with a $308 fine, a $60 Victims of Crime levy and three points.</p>

<p>The fine for the same offence is $484 in Victoria and $577 in the ACT. </p>

<p>The Northern Territory has the most lenient laws, where using a mobile will cost you three demerits and a $250 fine.</p>
