<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Block's judges surprised viewers during last month's season premiere with a bizarre dance routine to I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor.</p>

<p>And on Sunday, fans were disappointed to find out it wasn't a one-off.</p>

<p>Neale Whitaker, Darren Palmer and Shaynna Blaze showcased yet another eyebrow-raising performance, prompting backlash on Twitter. </p>

<p>'I thought this was a renovation show': The Block viewers weren't impressed by the judges' cringeworthy dance routine on Sunday night's episode. Pictured (L-R) Neale Whitaker, Shaynna Blaze and Darren Palmer</p>

<p>'WTF is it with the judges dancing and Darren's nipples?! I thought this was a renovation show,' one fan tweeted. </p>

<p>Another commented: 'Okay.. the dancing.. we have to address this..'</p>

<p>'OMG are we going to get the weird TikTok dances from the judges every week? Enough!' a third wrote.</p>

<p>Fans were baffled as the trio showed off their moves, including a pec-squeezing party trick from Darren and disco dances from Shaynna.</p>

<p>Not impressed: 'WTF is it with the judges dancing and Darren's nipples?! I thought this was a renovation show,' one fan tweeted</p>

<p>The judges danced solo before they all teamed up for a final number. </p>

<p>'Any semblance of cool these three judges have built up over five years was just shattered in that 15 seconds of dad dancing,' one unhappy viewer tweeted.</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Please tell me that stupid dancing intro for the judges is a one-time thing.'</p>

<p>'OMG are we going to get the weird TikTok dances from the judges every week? Enough!' a third chimed in</p>

<p>It comes after Neale told TV Tonight that the judges never got to meet the contestants on this year's season.</p>

<p>The 56-year-old said: 'I know their names, what they look like, where they come from and how old they are. But we've never actually met [them] face to face.' </p>

<p>Neale said that his co-stars Darren and Shaynna were required to critique most of the rooms, as he was busy with other commitments. </p>

<p>Who knew? Neale Whitaker, 56, (left) has revealed that it's not until he sits down to watch the show on television that he meets each of the contestants. Pictured with Shaynna Blaze</p>
