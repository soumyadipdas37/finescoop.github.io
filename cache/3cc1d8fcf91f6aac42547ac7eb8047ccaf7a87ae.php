<p>Solemn: Kris Jenner looked solemn as she cruised through Calabasas in her black Rolls Royce on Wednesday afternoon</p>

<p>The entire Kardashian clan took to their various social media pages on Tuesday to announce the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.</p>

<p>The announcement was an open love letter to the devout fan following they have  accumulated over their 14-years on the air, but it did not explicitly state a reason for pulling the plug on the series.</p>

<p>It did reveal that the final season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians would air 'early next year in 2021.'</p>

<p>Sources close to the situation claimed to TMZ that the Kardashian-Jenner family decided to step away from the show because their 'brand [gets] way more play on social media outlets and through their personal businesses than on TV.' </p>

<p>According to the sources, the Kardashians initially used their television series, which premiered in 2007, as a means of marketing themselves and the plethora of products they have put out over the years.</p>

<p>But with the growth of social media and streaming platforms threatening the fate of cable, motivation to maintain the series diminished.     </p>

<p>'Social media has largely replaced what "Keeping Up" once provided,' explained the source.</p>

<p>End of an era: The entire Kardashian clan took to their various social media pages on Tuesday to announce the end of Keeping Up With The Kardashians after 14-years and 20 seasons on E!</p>

<p>All love: The announcement was an open love letter to the devout fan following they have accumulated over their 14-years on the air, but it did not explicitly state a reason for pulling the plug on the series</p>

<p>Each member of the Kardashian-Jenner family, the females in particularly, have found themselves in the top ranks in terms of Instagram followings.</p>

<p>Kylie Jenner, 23, is currently the third most followed female user on the platform, with 195million followers. </p>

<p>Kim, 39, who is undoubtedly the star of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, has amassed 188million followers. Kendall, 24, Khloe, 36, and Kourtney, 41, all have over 100million followers. </p>

<p>For the brand: Sources close to the situation claimed to TMZ that the Kardashian-Jenner family decided to step away from the show because their 'brand [gets] way more play on social media outlets and through their personal businesses than on TV'</p>

<p>Keeping Up With The Kardashians was also allegedly suffering from low viewership, in comparison to prior seasons of the show.</p>

<p>The source added that this drop in viewership may be due to 'people watching in different ways these days, including streaming.' </p>

<p>Prior outlets reported that Kris and her offspring used money as motivation for leaving the reality series, with Kris allegedly asking for '$40 mil per season for a handful of more years.'</p>

<p>Not for money: Prior outlets reported that Kris and her offspring used money as motivation for leaving the reality series, with Kris allegedly asking for '$40 mil per season for a handful of more years'; Kris pictured in 2019</p>

<p>But, according to TMZ's insiders, money was not at the heart of the departure, instead the family felt that it was 'just time to move on, and chase opportunities elsewhere.'   </p>

<p>'We're told not one person or incident specifically ended the show,' the outlet stated.</p>

<p>After making their television exit, the Kardashian-Jenner family is allegedly 'planning to stay off-camera for a while and enjoy themselves, while reassessing what might be next for them as a unit.'  </p>
