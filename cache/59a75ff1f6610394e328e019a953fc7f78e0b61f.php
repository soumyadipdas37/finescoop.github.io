<p>'All I’m saying is the girl looked good, leave her. Allow her man. If Popcaan is going to endorse it and say yes my girl you’re wearing the flag and you’re wearing it well. Let her live her best life, leave her alone. We love Adele."</p>

<p>'Remember Adele grew up in Tottenham, Ldn, surrounded by Jamaican culture,' wrote one tweeter. </p>

<p>'For many kids, reagardless of their family origins, it was ingrained in their language, fashion, food not just music. With Adele we know it's coming from a good place, with love and respect.'</p>

<p>David Lammy, Member of Parliament for Tottenham agreed, tweeting in response to a critical article: 'Poppycock! This humbug totally misses the spirit of Notting Hill Carnival and the tradition of “ dress up” or “ masquerade”.'</p>

<p>'Adele was born and raised in Tottenham she gets it more than most. Thank you Adele. Forget the Haters.'</p>

<p>'Adele grew up between Brixton, West Norwood and Tottenham, they have some of the highest Black populations in the country. She's not some any posh girl from Sussex,' tweeted Jason Okundaye. </p>

<p>Adele captioned her original post: 'Happy what would be Notting Hill Carnival my beloved London.' </p>

<p>The carnival - an annual celebration of Caribbean culture - moved online for the first time this year amid the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Some fans suggested the star was also simply keen to show off her recent weight loss, with Avi Yemeni writing: 'Adele is getting smashed on Insta for “cultural appropriation” after posting this pic an hour ago.  </p>

<p>'Apparently, they now own hairstyles. These people are crazy. The poor woman just wanted to show off her epic weight loss. Don’t delete or apologise. We need you to be brave.'</p>

<p>Max West added:' Crazy... I have Jamaican family and I don’t care if anyone wears a bikini like this with the flag or wants to do some hairstyle - it literally doesn’t affect anyone. </p>

<p>'In fact, they don’t realise people in other countries encourage foreigners to buy their goods for tourism purposes.'</p>

<p>Neekie added: 'Every single thing is not necessarily offensive to every person in the group that it may reflect. Being Jamaican, I (ME!) am not pressed by Adele. We love people wanting to be us if you haven’t noticed. It’s a lil diff there (racially).' </p>

<p>Others simply pointed out the striking similarities between Adele and fellow chart-topper Katy Perry, with Piers Morgan tweeting: 'This is truly shocking... when did <?php echo e('@'); ?>Adelebecome <?php echo e('@'); ?>katyperry?'</p>

<p>Ernest Owens wrote on Twitter: 'If 2020 couldn't get anymore bizarre, Adele is giving us Bantu knots and cultural appropriation that nobody asked for. This officially marks all of the top white women in pop as problematic. Hate to see it.'</p>

<p>He later added: 'I'm too old and Black to be defending and making excuses for white people who still can't read the damn room in 2020.' </p>

<p>A user who goes by Johnny added: 'Adele dropped that weight and said it’s time for her cultural appropriation era.'</p>

<p>Kenisha wrote: 'If you haven’t quite understood cultural appropriation, look at Adele’s last Instagram post. She should go to jail no parole for this.' </p>

<p>Figure: She wowed fans when she showed off her dramatic transformation on her 32nd birthday in May</p>

<p>Showing her supportive side, the star made sure to match Beyonce's ensemble in the snap by wearing a brown shirt that had a crescent moon-print design.</p>

<p>She revealed her transformation is the result of a self-help book that led her to find 'joy and freedom'.</p>

<p>The pop star wrote in an Instagram post last month that reading Untamed, Stop Pleasing, Start Living by Glennon Doyle proved life-changing for her.</p>

<p>She shared a snap of the book's cover and said if her followers wanted to make changes they should buy a copy.</p>

<p>The Someone Like You singer said: 'If you're ready - this book will shake your brain and make your soul scream. I am so ready for myself after reading this book! </p>

<p>'It's as if I just flew into my body for the very first time. Whew! </p>

<p>Book club: She revealed her transformation is the result of a self-help book that led her to find 'joy and freedom'</p>

<p>'Anyone who has any kind of capacity to truly let go and give into yourself with any kind of desire to hold on for dear life - Do it. Read it. Live it. Practice it. We are a lot! But we are meant to be a lot!'</p>

<p>The star continued, saying the book will be one which she keeps on returning to for the rest of her life.</p>

<p>She said: 'Read this book and have a highlighter on hand to make notes because you'll want to refer back to it trust me! </p>

<p>Open: The singer said the book made her realise she was responsible for her own happiness and led her to make changes (pictured in 2016)</p>

<p>'I never knew that I am solely responsible for my own joy, happiness and freedom!! Who knew our own liberation liberates those around us? Cause I didn't!! </p>

<p>'I thought we were meant to be stressed and disheveled, confused and selfless like a Disney character! ProBloodyFound!! You're an absolute don Glennon.' </p>

<p>The book is described by Waterstones as 'part inspiration, part memoir, it explores the joy and peace we discover when we stop striving to meet the expectations of the world, and instead dare to listen to and trust in the voice deep inside us.' </p>
