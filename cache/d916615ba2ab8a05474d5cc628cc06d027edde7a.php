<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman from Michigan ended up receiving a postcard in her mailbox which had been sent almost exactly 100 years ago.</p>

<p>Brittany Keech from Belding, east of Grand Rapids said the message was completely unexpected and is now trying to find relatives of the intended recipient. </p>

<p>The postcard had a George Washington stamp affixed in the top right hand corner and was postmarked October 29th, 1920 having been sent just before Halloween of that year, from Jamestown, Michigan.</p>

<p>A postcard sent in October 1920 ended up in the mailbox of a woman from Michigan this week</p>

<p>The card was suitably Halloween themed but never made its way to its intended recipient</p>

<p>The front of the postcard depicts a witch together with a cat along with a goose and an owl and with a punny message, 'Halloween greetings. Witch would you rather be? A goose or a pumpkin head?' </p>

<p>'It was sitting right on top of the mail,' Keech told Fox 17. 'I start looking at it and I'm like, 'ok it's been through some wear and tear'', she said.  </p>

<p>The postcard was addressed to a Roy McQueen on Division Street and although the card looked old, the cursive handwriting written on the back of it was still legible:    </p>

<p>Dear Cousins, </p>

<p>Hope this will find you all well. We are quite well but mother has awful lame knees. It is awful cold here. I just finished my history lesson and am going to bed pretty soon. My father is shaving and my mother is telling me your address. I will have to close for a night. Hope grandma and grandpa are well. Don't forget to write us - Roy get his pants fixed yet.</p>

<p>The postcard was mailed with a 1 cent stamp just before Halloween 1920</p>

<p>Michigan resident Brittany Keech was baffled when she found a postcard dated October 29, 1920, in her mailbox this week</p>

<p>Keech is now hoping that she will be able to track down descendants of the people for whom the message was intended. </p>

<p>'This might be something that their parents can say, 'yea I remember when your great-great grandma would tell me stories.''</p>

<p>So far, she has posted it to a local Facebook group which celebrates local stories where it has received more than a hundred comments.</p>

<p>If the present-day family cannot be found, she says that she may offer it to the local museum in Belding. </p>

<p>One member of the community, Robby Peters, 33, from Grand Rapids has already begun the search to find relatives.   </p>

<p>Geneologists have confirmed the card was delivered to the address where Keech now lives which had been the home to Roy McQueen and Nora Murdoch in the 1920s</p>

<p>'I do some genealogy research as a hobby,' said Peters to the Washington Post. 'I started helping my own family, and I kind of caught the bug after that.'</p>

<p>Peters discovered a Roy McQueen in the 1920 census who lived at the same address where Keech now resides with her husband and two children. </p>

<p>McQueen, who was originally from Canada and moved to the United States in 1887, was married to a Nora Murdock and was the manager of a produce company.</p>

<p>The likely author of the postcard is Florence 'Flossie' Burgess, the daughter of Nora Murdock's sister, according to Peters.</p>

<p>'I found census records, death records and marriage records,' he explained. 'The postcard contained a couple of names and it had a destination, so I had an idea of where to start searching.' </p>

<p>'I built a family tree,' Peters said. 'It doesn't look like Roy and Nora had children, and Flossie seems to have remained unmarried, so there are no direct descendants.'</p>

<p>Keech is hoping to track down a living relative or will otherwise donate the card to a museum</p>

<p>Another woman, Sheryl Ackerman, also became obsessed with finding the family.</p>

<p>What she found tallies with Peters however she has managed to find a living relative - a grandniece of Roy and Nora whom she then put in touch with Keech. </p>

<p>'I've been speaking with the possible relative and she is very interested in having the postcard,' said Keech. 'We're talking about setting up a time to meet at some point.' </p>

<p>Although the Post Office has not explained the reason for the delay, one theory that was suggested is that card may have posted more recently. </p>

<p>'In most cases these incidents do not involve mail that had been lost in our network and later found. What we typically find is that old letters and postcards – sometimes purchased at flea markets, antique shops and even online – are re-entered into our system. The end result is what we do best – as long as there is a deliverable address and postage, the card or letter gets delivered,' the USPS wrote in statement. </p>

<p>Another possible explanation is that the postcard actually became stuck and lodged behind some post office machinery and only became freed after a recent refurbishment in an old post office.</p>
