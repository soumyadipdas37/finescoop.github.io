<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Chelsea coach Gianfranco Zola says he was sorry to see Maurizio Sarri lose his job but has commended Juventus for the 'courageous' appointment of Andrea Pirlo.</p>

<p>Zola worked as Sarri's assistant at Stamford Bridge in 2018-19 as Blues won the Europa League, but the pair were replaced with Frank Lampard and his management team at the end of the season. </p>

<p>Zola struggled during spells in charge of West Ham, Watford and Cagliari, but the Italian believes Andrea Pirlo has the 'superior knowledge' required to be successful at Juventus. </p>

<p>'I went to West Ham without ever having coached and I know what that means,' Zola told Corriere della Sera. 'We are talking about a champion who had superior knowledge of the game.</p>

<p>'Andrea must grow up quickly, choosing him was very courageous and it could become a brilliant move.'</p>

<p>Sarri led the Old Lady to a ninth successive Serie A title, but failure to progress beyond the last 16 of the Champions League convinced chairman Andrea Agnelli to replace Sarri with Pirlo</p>

<p>Zola expressed disappointment after his former colleague was dismissed but acknowledged the high standards held by the Juventus board.</p>

<p>'I'm a little sorry for him and his group, I worked with hem for a year at Chelsea and it was very important for me,' he added.</p>

<p>'We talked about it with Maurizio, that Juventus are a demanding team and sometimes it's not even enough to win.</p>

<p>'There are many requirements that must be met.'</p>
