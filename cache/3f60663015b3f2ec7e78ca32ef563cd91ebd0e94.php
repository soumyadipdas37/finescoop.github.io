<p>But Vicky didn't back down, telling him that the pair would make the 'best couple'. He replied: 'Yeah, potentially. We've never really thought about it like that, we're just super close mates.</p>

<p>'We like each other and the thing is, it's never been something that's crossed our minds and it wouldn't happen for the fact that we don't want to ruin our friendship.</p>
