<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paris Saint-Germain star Marquinhos has jumped to the defence of team-mate Neymar after the Brazilian winger was accused of racist abuse during a match against Marseille. </p>

<p>Neymar was sent off and banned for two matches for hitting Marseille's Alvaro Gonzalez earlier this month, with the PSG star accusing the Spanish defender of racial abuse towards him.</p>

<p>Gonzalez and Marseille now claim they possess evidence that it was in fact Neymar who made a racist slur during the match by calling defender Hiroki Sakai a 'Chinese s***'.</p>

<p>A Spanish TV network also accused the PSG star of making a homophobic slur, calling Gonzalez 'a f***ing queer' in the violent incident.  </p>

<p>Marquinhos, who plays with Neymar at both club and international level, claims the Brazilian is not the person to make these type of remarks. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old told Le Parisien: 'I know Neymar, he is a person that never uses racist insults. </p>

<p>'It is hard to say, because I was not on the pitch or close by and I have not seen the footage.</p>

<p>Neymar (right) himself accused Alvaro Gonzalez (left) of Marseille of making a racial slur</p>

<p>'But for anyone who knows Neymar, he never jokes around with words like that, and I believe he didn't do it.'</p>

<p>Marseille, meanwhile, refused to comment on the supposed accusations when questioned by AFP. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Ligue 1 club said: 'We have no comment. We entrust all our expertise and analysis to the examiners of the league.' </p>

<p>Neymar is set to return from suspension after two games out on Sunday night as PSG visit Stade de Reims in Ligue 1. </p>

<p>Neymar (middle) was sent off in the 1-0 defeat to Marseille in September for hitting Gonzalez</p>

<p>It will be the 28-year-old's first game back since the 1-0 defeat to Marseille on September 13, with Neymar one of three PSG players to receive red cards in the fiery encounter.</p>

<p>Layvin Kurzawa was handed a six-game ban for his role in the brawl while Leandro Paredes was given the same punishment as Neymar. </p>

<p>On the Marseille side, Jordan Amavi and Dario Benedetto were given a three and one-match ban respectively.</p>

<p>After the match, Neymar vented his fury at Alvaro Gonzalez over the alleged abuse. </p>

<p>The Brazilian attacker tweeted: 'You are not a man to assume your mistake, losing is part of the sport. Now insulting and bringing racism into our lives no, I don't agree.'</p>

<p>Gonzalez himself had tweeted: 'There is no place for racism... Sometimes you have to learn to lose and take it on the field. Incredible 3 points today. Allez l'OM. Thanks family.'</p>
