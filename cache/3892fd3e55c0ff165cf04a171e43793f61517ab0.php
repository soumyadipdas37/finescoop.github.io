<p>'Urzila gets a busting knock on the door, we're talking "bang, bang, bang!" Urzila's like, "Oh my god, someone's at the door, they're banging on the door!" Jackie said, as reported by news.com.au.</p>

<p>The banging on the door came from security at the Kiwi comedian's hotel, who warned her about the loud noises coming from her room.</p>

<p>Jackie continued: 'I said to her, "Why would you be getting a knock on the door at this time?" She said, "Probably because for the last hour and a half I've been yelling out, "Take it off, take it off, take it off!"'</p>

<p>'Someone's at the door!' Jackie explained that filming was interrupted at 1.30am when loud knocking was heard from Urzila's hotel room in New Zealand</p>

<p>Hilarious: Jackie continued, 'I was in tears thinking about the people in New Zealand in hotel quarantine hearing some girl on her own at 3.30 in the morning just yelling out these things'. Pictured is Jackie and Urzila</p>
