<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's the family favourite series which has graced the screens for over 35 years and launched the careers of A-list stars Chris Hemsworth, Margot Robbie and Kylie Minogue.</p>

<p>But there are new fears iconic Aussie soap Neighbours could be cancelled, after an already troubled year caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, the production company behind the hit TV show, Fremantle Media, told the ABC that changes to local content quotas could spell the death for the residents of Ramsey Street.</p>

<p>Is this the end of Neighbours? On Tuesday, Fremantle Media's chief executive Chris Oliver-Taylor (pictured) told the ABC that changes to local content quotas could spell the death for the residents of Ramsey Street after 35 years on-air </p>

<p> 'I think in the free-to-air environment Neighbours could most certainly be at risk if the quotas [for Australian content] were to change,' chief executive Chris Oliver-Taylor said. </p>

<p> The long-running drama was forced to halt production earlier this year at the beginning of the health crisis.</p>

<p>At the time, commercial broadcasters - who are governed by strict rules and must show 55 percent of locally made content - pleaded for a reprieve as they saw their revenue and ratings plunge.</p>

<p>'I think in the free-to-air environment Neighbours could most certainly be at risk if the quotas [for Australian content] were to change,' Mr Oliver-Taylor said (Pictured are Neighbours stars Richie Morris and Colette Mann) </p>

<p>The federal government threw the struggling networks a temporary lifeline by suspending the quotas for locally produced drama, documentaries and children's shows.</p>

<p>Review of the quotas has been placed on hold - with an option to extend the suspension if needed through 2021.</p>

<p>However, the networks are now calling for a permanent change, claiming the old rules are 'outdated'.</p>

<p>Oliver Taylor explained this could mean death for many shows.</p>

<p>'If there’s no incentive financially for those (Australian) networks to commission – to make content reasonably cheaper – than those networks will look to acquire content from overseas at a cheaper price point,' he said.</p>

<p>The suffering soap - which is filmed in Melbourne - has already been dealt several blows this year. </p>

<p>It was forced to shut down production twice in March, firstly after a crew member came into close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, and then a week later  after the government introduced strict  social distancing guidelines. </p>

<p>Popular star Tim Robards, who played Pierce Greyson, quit the show to reunite in Sydney with his pregnant wife Anna Heinrich ahead of the birth of their first child. </p>
