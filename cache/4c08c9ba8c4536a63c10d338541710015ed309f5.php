<p>Judge Ashley has stepped in for Simon Cowell after he was forced to miss the semi-finals due to a back injury. </p>

<p>Stunned: It earned a thunderous response from fans who praised the group and BGT bosses for depicting the issue</p>

<p>Simon was forced to pull out after breaking his back in a cycling accident, and after a six-hour operation has been recovering at home. </p>

<p>The music mogul has insisted producers have made the show the best it can be despite social distancing now being in place - and has even hinted he will indeed appear at the live final in October, despite being on bed rest. </p>

<p>Asked ahead of the show's semi-finals whether he worried the 2020 series was a right off, he said: 'Yeah, for a moment! But then I thought, "Where there’s a will, there’s a way!"</p>

<p>'I just thought that if we can talk to each other all over the world on something like Zoom then there must be a way for us to do the live shows.' </p>

<p>Dark: Dressed in riot gear, the dancer even had a policemen placing a hand over his throat while lying on the ground, played to the song I Can't Breathe</p>

<p>Taking a knee: The group also took a knee during the moving performance, which made a huge impact on viewers</p>

<p>Filling in: Judge Ashley has stepped in for Simon Cowell on the BGT semi-finals after he was forced to miss the semi-finals due to a back injury</p>

<p>Simon underwent emergency surgery in America after the accident in Los Angeles earlier this month, and has been recovering after having a metal rod installed in his back. </p>

<p>This year marks the first time in BGT history that the semi-finals have been pre-recorded, and has also seen changes to the way acts will advance to the final. </p>

<p>Eight contestants will perform in each semi-final and the judges will choose one act to go through. The second finalist will then be chosen via public vote when the episode airs.</p>

<p>With safety concerns paramount, some acts will take part remotely via video link whilst others will perform in the TV studio – with the virtual audiences' reactions then beamed into the studio on a giant screen.  </p>

<p>The series will then culminate with the live final, in October, where one act will triumph as Britain’s Got Talent 2020 Champion and win the life-changing £250,000 prize plus a coveted role on The Royal Variety Performance.</p>

<p>Britain's Got Talent continues on Saturday at 8pm on ITV. </p>
