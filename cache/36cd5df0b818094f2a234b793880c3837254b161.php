<p>West Ham eased into the fourth round of the Carabao Cup with a 5-1 victory over Hull City</p>

<p>Malik Wilks gave the Tigers brief hope when he made it 3-1 with 20 minutes to go but Grant McCann's side tired in the final stages of the game with Haller and Yarmolenko scoring twice in the last five minutes.</p>

<p>West Ham will play Fleetwood Town or Everton in the fourth round next week.</p>

<p>But West Ham will play that game without manager David Moyes and two of his players after they were dramatically sent home from the London Stadium prior to their win after testing positive for Covid-19.</p>

<p>Defender Issa Diop and midfielder Josh Cullen were initially named in the team to face the League One Tigers.</p>

<p>But 15 minutes later the line-up was changed with both players omitted, and when the teams came out there was no sign of Moyes, with assistant Alan Irvine taking charge.</p>

<p>A club statement subsequently read: 'West Ham United can confirm that David Moyes, Issa Diop and Josh Cullen have returned positive tests for Covid-19.</p>

<p>'The club's medical team were informed of the test results as the team were at London Stadium preparing for this evening's Carabao Cup third-round tie against Hull City.</p>

<p>'The manager and both players immediately left the stadium and have returned home. All three, who are asymptomatic, will now follow Public Health England and Premier League guidelines and protocols.'</p>
