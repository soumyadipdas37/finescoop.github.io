<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She's quite a prolific artist, and a poetic one, at that.</p>

<p>And Lana Del Rey was celebrating the release of her new book of poetry, titled Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass, on Thursday, with a series of whimsical images on her Instagram.</p>

<p>The Mariner's Apartment Complex songbird, 35, kept up the retro vibes in the collection of images, video and boomerangs, spread over her Instagram feed and Stories.</p>

<p>Retro goddess: Lana Del Rey was celebrating the release of her new book of poetry, titled Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass, on Thursday</p>

<p>The main photos of the queen of nostalgia showed her in a picnic setting, wearing a wide brimmed straw hat and white floral sweetheart top in dappled sunlight. </p>

<p>The statement element of Lana's ensemble, however, were her beguiling white opera gloves, which were covered in bubble-like pearls.</p>

<p>She matched these with very high-heeled chunky pumps, also weighted with a multitude of improbable pearls. </p>

<p>Standing in for Tippi Hedren: The Mariner's Apartment Complex songbird kept up the retro vibes in the collection of images and video, spread over her Instagram feed and Stories</p>

<p>Pearls much: The main photos of the queen of nostalgia showed her in a picnic setting, wearing beguiling white opera gloves, which were covered in bubble-like pearls, along with matching pumps</p>

<p>The heels were mainly visible in snippets in which Del Rey leafed through the pages of her tome, the cover of which displays artwork showing an orange tree of sorts.</p>

<p>'Very excited that Violet bent backwards over the grass is out everywhere on Monday,' the White Mustang songstress wrote in the caption of a Boomerang clip of her glancing from her book, to the camera, to the sunlight above. 'Thank you so much for supporting'.</p>

<p>She went on in the caption to say that the 'proceeds of the entirety of the advance from Simon and Schuster [are] being split up between three organizations including the Navajo Water Project which will reopen in January.'</p>

<p>Another image of the gorgeous Grammy nominee showed her topless wrapped in a towel, open-mouthed, over the caption 'Bodega Bae Waiting for the birds to attack'.</p>

<p>It was a reference to the 1963 Alfred Hitchcock classic The Birds, which was set in Northern California's Bodega Bay.</p>

<p>The reference fit perfectly in Lana's old-school universe, as she frequently calls up instances of Americana from the 50s and 60s.</p>

<p>Daydreamy: Lana also donned a wide brimmed straw hat and white floral sweetheart top in the dappled sunlight</p>

<p>Violet Bent Backwards Over The Grass was also released as an audiobook/spoken word album this summer, in late July.</p>

<p>The work featured Lana reading her verses of poetry, along with music from frequent collaborator Jack Antonoff. </p>

<p>And for fans of Del Rey's music, they reportedly won't have to wait much longer – the singer is on the precipice of releasing her seventh studio album this year, titled Chemtrails Over The Country Club.</p>

<p>It will be the followup word to her acclaimed 2019 record, Norman F**king Rockwell!. </p>
