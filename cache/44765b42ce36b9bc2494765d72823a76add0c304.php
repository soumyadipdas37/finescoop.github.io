<p>But Holly Willoughby looked well and truly baffled as she was faced with the sight of a bikini-clad Vick Hope bathing in a tub of wine during Thursday's show.</p>

<p>The TV host, 39, appeared bewildered as Vick, 30, soaked in seven bottles of red wine while testing out a luxurious spa treatment in Chelsea.  </p>

<p>What on earth? Holly Willoughby looked well and truly baffled as she was faced with the sight of a bikini-clad Vick Hope bathing in a tub of wine during Thursday's show </p>

<p>Hosting a competition segment, Vick said: 'Welcome to my wine therapy experience! I'm in in Chelsea and I'm told that this spa is frequented by members of Made in Chelsea.</p>

<p>'The smell is so good, I've been promised that I'm not going to stink of alcohol for the rest of the day and also that it's not going to stain my bikini.' </p>

<p>Holly jokingly responded: 'That's got to stain your bikini!'  </p>

<p>Soaked in 'fine Italian wine', rapeseed oil and with rose petals floating around her body, Vick laughed as the camera cut to her.</p>

<p>Latest spa craze: The TV host, 39, appeared bewildered as Vick, 30, (pictured) soaked in seven bottles of red wine while testing out a luxurious spa treatment in Chelsea</p>

<p>Wine not? Soaked in 'fine Italian wine', rapeseed oil and with rose petals floating around her body, Vick laughed as the camera cut to her</p>

<p>Your turn: 'The smell is so good, I've been promised that I'm not going to stink of alcohol for the rest of the day and also that it's not going to stain my bikini'</p>

<p>'Maybe you get out of it and get in one with white wine?' Holly quipped with a laugh.</p>

<p>She added: 'That can't be good for your skin... fascinating though!'  </p>

<p>It seems viewers weren't too impressed with the treatment either, with many calling it a waste of wine.</p>

<p>One took to Twitter to comment on how it's 'not the kind of wine therapy I were thinking #ThisMorning.' </p>

<p>Holly and co-host Phillip Schofield, 58, returned to the sofa this week after their summer break.</p>

<p>On Thursday's show, Holly and Phil announced that Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing, 31, and EastEnders star Maisie Smith, 19, were the latest names to join the line-up for this year's Strictly Come Dancing. </p>

<p>Not for me! It seems viewers weren't too impressed with the treatment either, with many calling it a waste of wine</p>

<p>Vick - who competed on Strictly in 2018 - joked from her bathtub: 'You might want to get on the phone to Jamie Laing ahead of his Strictly experience, he can come and relax. </p>

<p>'I can tell you from experience that it does take its toll on your muscles.'  </p>

<p>The hit BBC One show will be returning this autumn, making history with its first ever same-sex couple with Olympic boxer Nicola Adams, 37. </p>

<p>The double Olympic champion retired undefeated in 2019 and will continue making history as she becomes one half of a female same sex duo in the show. </p>

<p>She said in a statement: 'It's amazing to be a part of the movement for change, diversity and breaking boundaries in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>'It's really important, it's a big step for the show as well. It's nice to see we've been able to move on and I just can't wait to get some dancing done really.'</p>

<p>Big announcement: Made In Chelsea's Jamie Laing, 31, and EastEnders star Maisie Smith, 19, were revealed as the latest names to join the line-up for this year's Strictly Come Dancing</p>
