<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United legend Gary Neville has warned goalkeeper Dean Henderson he could face a wait for the club's No 1 spot after returning from two impressive loans at Sheffield United.</p>

<p>The former right-back believes Henderson still has 'a lot to prove' and feels he lacks the experience of playing for a big team - calling for David de Gea to continue as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's first choice.</p>

<p>The Spaniard has come under fire after a string of costly mistakes in between the sticks and some fans and pundits have called for him to be dropped.  </p>

<p>Gary Neville believes keeper Dean Henderson still has 'a lot to prove' at Manchester United </p>

<p>Gary Neville believes David de Gea (R) will start as United's No 1 over Henderson next season </p>

<p>But Neville believes his place in the starting line-up shouldn't be in danger despite Henderson recently signing a new deal worth £120,000 per week, insisting that Solskjaer's faith in him last season will not change now.   </p>

<p>'De Gea definitely starts as No.1 because there was a point where Ole could've dropped him towards the end of the season,' he told Sky Sports. </p>

<p>'However, he stuck with him at that point and we are only around four weeks later.'</p>

<p>He expects Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (R) to keep faith in De Gea despite some high-profile errors </p>

<p>Henderson impressed during his time with the Blades and kept 13 clean sheets last season, making 97 saves. </p>

<p>But Neville says he will face a different environment at United - being forced to spring into action after an opposition counter attack - and argued that being the club's No 1 is 'one of the most pressurised positions in English football'.</p>

<p>'I still think Henderson's got a lot to prove,' he added.</p>

<p>'Playing in goal for Sheffield United is a lot different than standing out there in that vacuous, empty, massive space which is the goal mouth at Old Trafford, when the team are up at the other end of the pitch most of the time attacking and then all of sudden you've got your first interaction with the game after 15 minutes and your concentration is tested like never before.</p>

<p>Neville says Henderson lacks the experience to start for a massive club like Manchester United</p>

<p>'It's not a given that he's going to go into the team at Manchester United and be everything that everyone thinks he's going to be.</p>

<p>'He hasn't got the experience yet to handle Old Trafford or to show us that he can handle Old Trafford.</p>

<p>'I think the Manchester United goalkeeping position, I would argue, is one of the most pressurised positions in English football.'</p>

<p>The 23-year-old was impressive for Sheffield United and has no plans to be second choice </p>

<p>It comes after Henderson admitted he expects to be first choice under Solskjaer and would not be happy to sit on the bench this season after winning so many admirers at Bramall Lane in 2019-20. </p>

<p>'Coming off a good season with momentum, it wouldn't be clever for me to sit around and not play football,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don't think that would help any parties at all.'</p>
