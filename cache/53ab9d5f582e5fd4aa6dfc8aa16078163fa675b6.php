<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona defender Samuel Umtiti could be set to rejoin former club Lyon with his future at the Nou Camp looking uncertain.</p>

<p>The French international moved to the La Liga runner's up in 2016 and has endured a wretched run, missing 66 games across all competitions in his four years in Catalonia.</p>

<p>Reports from L'Equipe via Diario AS, claim Lyon manager Rudi Garcia wants to bring the 26-year-old defender back to Ligue 1.</p>

<p>Samuel Umtiti only featured in 18 games for Barcelona across all competitions last season</p>

<p>The French international began his career with Lyon and played 170 games for the Ligue 1 side</p>

<p>Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman is reported to be open to selling the defender, providing he can sign a replacement before the transfer window closes next month. </p>

<p>However Umtiti's wages could scupper any potential deal, the Frenchman is reportedly on €12m per year and despite securing Champions League football this season; Lyon are not able to afford his salary and Umtiti is unlikely to lower his wage demands to push through a deal. </p>

<p>A host of big names have left the Nou Camp this summer including Luis Suarez (Atletico Madrid), Ivan Rakitic (Sevilla) and Arturo Vidal. (Inter Milan)</p>

<p>The Catalan's ended last season without any silverware after finishing 2nd in La Liga to Real Madrid and endured a humiliating exit from the Champions League after being thrashed 8-2 in the quarter finals by Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>Then manager Quique Setien was promptly sacked and replaced by club legend Ronald Koeman, who has been tasked with reinvigorating the club.</p>

<p>Barcelona kick off their La Liga campaign at home against Villarreal on Sunday, September 27.</p>
