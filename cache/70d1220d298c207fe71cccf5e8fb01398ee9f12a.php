<p>Pretty in pink! Kiki Morris was all business as she got glammed up for a photoshoot to promote Stax activewear</p>

<p>The blonde beauty posed up a storm and flaunted her curves for the cameras.</p>

<p>In addition to diet and exercise, Kiki has turned to other methods to maintain her flawless physique.</p>

<p>In footage shared to her Instagram Stories earlier this month, the reality star underwent a non-surgical Brazilian Butt Lift to 'zap the fat' on her derrière and thighs. </p>

<p>Work it: The blonde beauty posed up a storm and flaunted her curves for the cameras</p>

<p>Looking good: The model showed off the sporty ensemble and a matching tote bag </p>

<p>Wearing a white T-shirt and a black G-string, a beautician was seen using a Cavitation machine to firm the skin around her buttocks and the front of her thighs.</p>

<p>The procedure, which she had done at Beautylicious by Sophie, costs $360. </p>

<p>At least four sessions are recommended to not only sculpt the buttocks, but also migrate fat to the area and assist in the reduction of cellulite.  </p>

<p>Mellow in yellow! At one stage, Kiki changed into a yellow outfit </p>

<p>Grass is greener: The reality star worked the camera inside of a grassy set </p>

<p>It all comes about eight months after Kiki had her heart broken by love rat Ciarran.</p>

<p>Kiki and Ciarran had started dating on the third season of Bachelor in Paradise, which was filmed in Fiji late last year.</p>

<p>Right before the finale, Ciarran told Kiki he was in love with her and wanted them to leave the show together without going through the formality of a rose ceremony.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the couple split just a few weeks after returning to Australia.</p>

<p>Ciarran, who rose to fame on Angie Kent's season of The Bachelorette, apparently 'ghosted' Kiki and moved from Sydney to Melbourne.</p>

<p>Bag lady! Kiki flung her tote bag around and adjusted her visor for another photo</p>
