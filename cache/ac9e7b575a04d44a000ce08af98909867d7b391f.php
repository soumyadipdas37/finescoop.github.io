<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane admits he is unsure when Eden Hazard will return to the squad after his latest injury set-back, and says the player is 'not happy' after his hopes of a comeback were dashed.</p>

<p>The Belgian's move to the Bernabeu has been a struggle despite arriving from Chelsea for £130m as he scored just once last season before being sidelined with a troublesome ankle problem. </p>

<p>Hazard came under fire for reportedly arriving back at pre-season out of shape, but had been making good progress towards a return and was tipped to feature against Real Valladolid on Wednesday night before picking up a leg muscle injury in training.</p>

<p>Real Madrid's Eden Hazard has been set back by yet another injury problem at the Bernabeu</p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane admits the player is 'upset' after picking up a muscle problem in training </p>

<p>The Belgian was forced to watch Madrid's 1-0 win over Real Valladolid from the sidelines </p>

<p>Los Blancos scraped a 1-0 win without Hazard, and after the game Zidane was unable to shed any light on how long he would be without the winger, admitting the 29-year-old was 'upset'. </p>

<p>'I can't tell you how long it'll be. He picked up a bit of a knock in training before the game,' he told the media.</p>

<p>'It looked like a muscle spasm but in the end it turned out to be a bit more than that. It's something muscular. It's nothing to do with the injury he's had and these things happen.'</p>

<p>Hazard's spell in Madrid has been blighted by injuries after missing a chunk of last season </p>

<p>The Spanish press had drummed up Hazard's possible return after his disastrous season last term and billed the 2020-21 campaign as his 'second try' having failed to justify his huge transfer fee, but Zidane insisted the club must be patient with him. </p>

<p>'He's been out for a long time,' he added. 'I don't think this one will be long but I can't tell you exactly. He's upset because he was all right. We talked about it at the press conference before the match, but he's had a setback and these things can happen.</p>

<p>'He's not happy, he knows that it's not a big thing and we have to take it easy with him. It's a question of little time, I'm sure.'</p>

<p>He has failed to impress since his £130m move and has been slammed by the Spanish media </p>

<p>Hazard has faced criticism from the media in Spain, who slammed his decision to go on Belgium duty last month instead of continuing his rehabilitation. </p>

<p>And despite reports he had turned up overweight at Real Madrid's camp this summer, Zidane has insisted the player 'didn't lack professionalism'.</p>

<p>Vinicius Jr scored the only goal against Real Valladolid as Madrid won their second game of the season having beaten Real Betis 3-2 last time out. </p>
