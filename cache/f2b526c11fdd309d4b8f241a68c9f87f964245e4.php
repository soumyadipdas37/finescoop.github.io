<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves will listen to offers for Ruben Vinagre as they attempt to add a new midfielder before the start of the season.</p>

<p>Vinagre has admirers in Europe, with FC Porto believed to be showing an interest in the left-sided player.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old was second-choice at left wing-back to Jonny throughout the last campaign and even though Jonny is out for a long spell with a knee injury, Wolves have signed Marcal from Lyon this week to replace him.</p>

<p>Porto are interested in signing Wolves left-back Ruben Vinagre this summer</p>

<p>Boss Nuno Espirito Santo should also get the energetic central midfielder he wants this week. As revealed by Sportsmail last month, Nuno's principal targets were a left-sided defender, an up-and-coming forward and a box-to-box midfielder.</p>

<p>Marcal and 18-year-old forward Fabio Silva match the first two requirements, but Nuno is desperate for an alternative to Joao Moutinho, Ruben Neves and Leander Dendoncker in the middle.</p>

<p>He also has a space at right wing-back after Matt Doherty was sold to Spurs.</p>
