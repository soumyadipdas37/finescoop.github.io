<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A cyclist attempted to scold a man with disabilities for his motorized, adaptive equipment in an Indiana park.</p>

<p>Video of the incident was shared on Facebook by Tom Morris, who explained that he posted the video to bring awareness.</p>

<p>'The only reason I posted that video was because I want to advocate for people that, maybe, don't have the ability to advocate for themselves,' Morris said.</p>

<p>He added that the takeaway from the incident shouldn't be anger towards the couple, but 'kindness.' </p>

<p>Footage shows Morris traveling down a dirt path this week with his adaptive equipment when he encounters a couple standing on the trail.</p>

<p>'Seriously dude, you're not supposed to have e-bikes on this thing,' the male cyclist says.</p>

<p>'This is a handicapped piece of equipment,' Morris answers, to which the cyclist replies, 'and?'</p>

<p>Morris this week was riding his adaptive equipment in an Indiana park when he encountered a cycling couple on the path</p>

<p>The man (pictured) confused Morris' adaptive equipment with an e-bike and attempted to reprimand him for using it on the path</p>

<p>'Show me the rules saying that you're allowed to do this,' the cyclist presses. 'Come on buddy, you're breaking the rules of the park.'</p>

<p>Morris then interjects to explain that 'it's a handicap piece of equipment and I can't walk.'</p>

<p>The cyclist appears to sigh and walk away, while the female cyclist tells Morris that he 'should have led with that.'</p>

<p>The footage ends with the two men still discussing the matter as Morris drives away.</p>

<p>The video ends with the female cyclist telling Morris he 'should have led with that' and the two men exchanging words as Morris leaves the area</p>

<p>'2020 has been quite a challenge for all of us but remember no matter what, be KIND to each other,' wrote Morris on Facebook. </p>

<p>In a second video, he further urged his followers to show compassion for the couple and for other people in their daily lives.</p>

<p>'I want you to remember one thing that I wrote yesterday when I posted that video, and I said kindness,' Morris said.</p>

<p>He said that he did not post the video immediately after the incident happened, but changed his mind after seeing a child with disabilities on social media.</p>

<p>'When I woke up the next morning, I opened up some social media and the very first person on my feed was an eight-year-old little boy with Spinal Bifida,' he said.</p>

<p>'And all I can think is, what if this had happened to him, or someone like him, who doesn't have a voice or a platform like I do.'</p>

<p>Morris (pictured): 'The message is kindness. As we move forward, man, I would just appreciate if we could just look at people with a bit more empathy, and try and get out there to make this place better'</p>

<p>Morris then said the video was 'never meant with intentions to cause harm or do ill will to those two people.'</p>

<p>'I don't know them. I know them from one interaction and I have nothing but love and kindness for them. This isn't a revenge thing - it's not anything like that...'</p>

<p>He urged commentors and people who viewed the video to not disparage the couple.  </p>

<p>'What that man and woman's comments...they weren't very nice, but some of the stuff that's being written in those messages are challenging,' Morris said.</p>

<p>'And that's not who I am, that's not what the message is. The message is kindness.</p>

<p>'As we move forward, man, I would just appreciate if we could just look at people with a bit more empathy, and try and get out there to make this place better.'</p>

<p>An updated video on Morris' Facebook revealed he spoke with Department of Natural Resources Deputy Director Terry Coleman, who said adaptive equipment is allowed on all state trails </p>

<p>Morris revealed in a final update that he was contact by Indiana's former Department of Natural Resources Deputy Director Terry Coleman, who explained he was well within his right to use adaptive equipment.</p>

<p>'He said what I'm on is not an e-bike, it's an adaptive piece of equipment and adaptive equipment is allowed on all of the trails throughout all of Indiana,' said Morris.</p>

<p>He added that Coleman said the state had purchased around 12 'off-roading wheelchairs' that give access to people who do have disabilities and need.  </p>
