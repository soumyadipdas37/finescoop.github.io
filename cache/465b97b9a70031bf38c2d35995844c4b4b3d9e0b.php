<p>Jimmy and Tam, 31, were tasked with making a utensil holder, but struggled to create what was supposed to be a tall, open cylinder.</p>

<p>Challenge: Jimmy and Tam were tasked with making a kitchen utensil holder during Tuesday's episode of The Block, but struggled to create what was supposed to be a tall, open cylinder</p>

<p>'It is so hard,' admitted an earnest Tam, as Jimmy sat beside her and giggled naughtily.</p>

<p>She added: 'Getting that stuff up high is not easy.'</p>

<p>As Jimmy feebly continued to try and mold the clay, it wasn't long before both he and Tam burst out laughing at their questionable creation.</p>

<p>'You have to do things to that clay that you thought you'd never have to do,' Jimmy cheekily confessed</p>

<p>'You have to do things to that clay that you thought you'd never have to do,' a smiling Jimmy confessed.</p>

<p>It's not the first time an X-rated joke has made its way onto The Block this year.</p>

<p>Naughty boy: At one stage, their design took on a phallic shape, with a cheeky Jimmy, 33, leaning down and putting his mouth near the tip of the clay</p>

<p>While it took the 33-year-old electrician a moment to register what Keith had actually meant by the comment, he was left red-faced by the raunchy remark. </p>

<p>'We're gonna need six, seven guys to get this, so it's going to have to stay here at least so I can try and get it up,' George explained.</p>

<p>Without missing a beat, Keith asked: 'Do you have trouble getting it up?'</p>

<p>Having a laugh: As Jimmy feebly continued to try and mold the clay, it wasn't long before both he and Tam burst out laughing at their questionable creation</p>
