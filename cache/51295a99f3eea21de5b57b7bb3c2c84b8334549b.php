<p>'I used to be a taxi driver in Brisbane. I was also involved in a cleaning business in Queensland for at least four years,' he told the publication. </p>

<p>Mr Dhaliwal explained farming had been a tradition in his family for generations.</p>

<p>'I was very lucky that I found some local friends from the farming sector who helped and guided me to start this venture in Mildura,' he said. </p>

<p>The father-of-two said there are 'huge' opportunities for people to try their hand in the farming sector in the Mildura.</p>

<p>The town of about 32,000 people is closely located to the New South Wales border and is about six hours north-west of Melbourne. </p>

<p>'We are living a very peaceful life. Our family prefers rural life as compared to the hustle and bustle of the city. Moving here was a unanimous decision by our family and we have never regretted making this choice,' he said.</p>

<p>Mildura has all the facilities the family needs - including schools and a hospital - and Mr Dhaliwal's wife was able to find work. </p>

<p>The farmer said his current career choice means he gets to spend more time with his children. The family are enjoying a 'prosperous, happy, and healthy' life.  </p>
