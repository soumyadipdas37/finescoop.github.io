<p>The Douglas County cop was delivering civil papers to a home near Douglasville last Monday when she left the driver's side door of her car wide open - only for a pet goat to climb inside. </p>

<p>Footage shows the officer knocking on the front door of the property, before she looks over and notices the animal wandering toward her vehicle. </p>

<p>'Hope that goat don't get in my car,' the deputy says to herself, before it jumps right in. </p>

<p>'S**t!' she mutters, as she rushes back toward the automobile.  </p>

<p>The officer opens the passenger's side door to find the goat munching on paperwork.</p>

<p>'Get out! Get out!' the cop yells, but the animal fails to listen, and continues chowing down on the documents. </p>

<p>The cop struggles to attract the attention of the animal, as she wanders back and forth from each side of the vehicle trying to push it out. </p>

<p>After more than a minute, the goat finally jumps out of the car with a sheaf of papers in its mouth. </p>

<p>Two pet dogs arrive on the scene barking at the unfolding spectacle. </p>

<p>Bodycam footage shows the female cop pushed to the ground by the goat, as paperwork she was holding is strewn across the lawn. </p>

<p>'Get out! Get out!' the cop yells, but the animal fails to listen, and continues chowing down on the documents</p>

<p>After more than a minute, the goat finally jumps out of the car with a sheaf of papers in its mouth</p>

<p>The officer manages to pick up her papers and wrestle the document out of the goat's mouth before finally going on her way. </p>

<p>She appears to find the incident amusing, and can be heard chuckling as she gets back insider her vehicle to continue on with her day. </p>

<p>The Douglas Country Sheriff's Office also managed to see the funny side, and shared the bodycam footage to its Facebook page. </p>

<p>'Even though the officer was knocked to the ground, she was not physically harmed in the incident. At the end of the day we all got a little laugh out of it and we hope you do as well!' they wrote. </p>
