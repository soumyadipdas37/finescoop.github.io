<p>Candid: Jourdan Dunn has shared her concerns for her son Riley's future in an emotional letter following 'cases of injustice and brutality against black people'</p>

<p>An extract from the letter, read: 'My love for you runs so deep. It's my mission to instil you with the greatest examples of affection, nurture and care. </p>

<p>'But I worry that this world will break your kind and loving spirit. Your innocence has been shaken by the recent cases of injustice and brutality against black people.</p>

<p>'At times, I've felt helpless finding the right way to comfort you while I myself am in pain – afraid, hurt and angry. Like me, occasionally you will lose faith in humanity, but it will be restored again and again.</p>

<p>'You owe people nothing – but you do owe it to yourself to be happy and carefree and set this world on fire. Be a joyful black boy in a society that wants to portray you in a different light. </p>

<p>Sharing: The model, 30, admitted that her son's innocence has been 'shaken' and she feels helpless trying to comfort him while she also feels 'afraid' following recent events</p>

<p>'Some will want to label you because of misperceptions based on racial hate and pettiness, but only you can own your narrative, only you can create your own story. </p>

<p>'Your future is so bright, I'm excited to witness it. It's all yours for the taking, Ry... You're Black history in the making.'</p>

<p>Engaged! Despite the ongoing pandemic, the British beauty has had a year of celebrations following her engagement announcement to her partner Dion Hamilton in February</p>

<p>The model's post in January sparked speculation that she had already married Dion, as she shared the holiday post of themselves alongside her beloved son Riley, nine.</p>

<p>The accompanying caption was rather telling. She wrote: '2009 my son entered my life, 2019 my life partner entered my life. Stepping into 2020 with both by my side is priceless.'</p>
