<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bride-to-be has revealed she's fallen out with her mother and stepfather after they gave away the $10,000 they'd promised her for her wedding fund to her stepsister.  </p>

<p>The US-based bride's story was shared by another woman on the That's It, I'm Ring Shaming Facebook group, where the author revealed all the children in the family had been promied $10,000 for their weddings. </p>

<p>But when she asked her family for hers in preparation for her wedding, the author was told her share had been given to her stepsister - on top of the $10,000 she had already received prior to Covid-19. </p>

<p>Her stepsister's plans had ended up costing more due to cancellations and non-refundable deposts, and stepfather and mother called the bride-to-be 'petty' when she complained to them about it.</p>

<p>Members of the wedding shaming community said the author was entitled to feel put out that her stepsister had been given preferential treatment. </p>

<p>A bride-to-be revealed her step-father and mother gave her step-sister double the wedding fund of $10,000 while she received nothing (stock picture)</p>

<p>'I feel so bad for this bride. I personally knew I wasn’t going to be getting money towards my wedding. But if I had known everyone was getting something and then for it to be taken away is awful. Especially since it was done twice. And the favoritism is awful,' the woman who shared the post to the group wrote. </p>

<p>The bride explained in her post that her step-sister had already received $10,000 from their parents ahead of her wedding.</p>

<p>However, due to covid-19's unforeseen consequences on weddings celebrations around the world, the step-sister was faced with an onslaught of cancellations for the different services she had booked for her big day. </p>

<p>The step-sister decided to go ahead with her wedding and have a reduced ceremony in the winter, with a smaller budget. </p>

<p>The bride explained she was told she would receive the $10,000 for her wedding like her other siblings, but her find went to her step-sister instead</p>

<p>The author, who was also engaged to be married, started to plan her own wedding and asked her mother if she could have the $10,000 fund that all her siblings had received for their own weddings. </p>

<p>However, her mother admitted that her $10,000 share had gone to her sister, who had asked for it behind her back. </p>

<p>The author's step-father (who is the step-sister's father) agreed because the step-sister and her fiance both worked low-paying jobs and would not be able to save enough. </p>

<p>The author's mother also admitted the step-father justified his decision to give her share to the step-sister instead because the author's groom-to-be was 'fifthly rich' and would be able to take care of the ceremony cost. </p>

<p>When the author complained to her step-father and mother about her decision, they called her 'petty.' </p>

<p>The bride said she worried she was being selfish, but said she wondered whether her step-father would have been so quick to give the money if the $10,000 had belonged to her step-sister instead of her. </p>

<p>'My step-dad even said that since I'm so petty he's glad he never gave me a cent for my wedding. </p>

<p>She also added a similar had happened when the step-father had given her university to the same step-sister after she blew her allowance on partying.  </p>

<p>Members of the wedding shaming group said they felt for the bride-to-be who had her allowance taken away.  </p>

<p>'That's really sad that they obviously care so much less for her,' one said. </p>

<p>'I would set something on fire. Likely stepdads car,' said another. </p>

<p>Members of the Wedding Shaming group said they felt for the poor bride-to-be, whose fund had been taken away from </p>

<p>'While the step father is correct that he can spend it how he likes, to give it to another child after paying that much for everyone else’s wedding AND double For one of the sisters is beyond cruel. Especially considering that they likely told the them all their life that they would pay for their wedding,' one wrote. </p>

<p>'Honestly, I’d cut them out of my life and not because of the actual cash. I’d be cutting them out because any parents that could be so cruel and simultaneously show so very much preference for the other children does not deserve me in their life,' they went on.  </p>

<p>'While she is not entitled to any money, she is allowed to be upset that she is being treated unfairly. Totally ok to set her boundaries and be done,' agreed another.  </p>

<p>'That’s heartbreaking and frustrating,' one said. </p>

<p>'Change the plans but cut out your parents and the sister that got the money twice. Blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,' said one. </p>
