<p>She said: 'My dad was really young. He'd had all his kids [with Frost] by 30. Mum, too. She also had a baby face.   </p>

<p>'I can never tell [her age] in pictures, I'll say, "What, you had three kids by that age?" She looks 17.'</p>

<p>'Everyone's parents were rock 'n' roll when they were young. That's not a crazy thing.' </p>
