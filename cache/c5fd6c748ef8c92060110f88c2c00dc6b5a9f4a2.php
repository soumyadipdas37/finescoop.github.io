<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A heartbroken pet owner has said his cockapoo puppy Stanley died after swallowing a £2.50 rubber toy from B&amp;M. </p>

<p>Joe Green said his nine-week-old pet passed away two weeks ago following complications during surgery to remove parts of the Puppy Play Pack from his gut.</p>

<p>The pooch had been chewing on the items which are labelled 'for puppy's first play time' and include a ball, rope and various rigged rubber chew toys.</p>

<p>Stanley is said to have ended up swallowing several pieces of the chewed up rubber which later became lodged in his gut.</p>

<p>Stanley (pictured), a nine-week-old cockapoo puppy, is said to have died after swallowing a £2.50 rubber toy from B&amp;M, according to his owner Joe Green from Northamptonshire </p>

<p>He was rushed to the vets for surgery but owner Joe from Daventry, Northamptonshire, said he 'didn't stand a chance' and passed away shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Joe was left furious after B&amp;M allegedly told him they would continue to sell the £2.49 item until it was 'proven to be unsafe'.</p>

<p>He warned other pet owners on Facebook not to buy any dog toys from B&amp;M and wrote alongside photographs of Stanley: 'Please be aware.. Do not buy dog toys from B&amp;M.</p>

<p>'This was our 9-week-old cockapoo pup Stanley. He was the most loving and caring little guy.</p>

<p>'Sadly he died last night following complications from surgery - he was bought a Puppy Play Pack from B&amp;M.</p>

<p>'The toys are not safe for pups. As you can see from the picture there are two colours of toy from two different packs (one pink one blue) this shows that neither of the products are safe.</p>

<p>'The toys are labeled as puppy's first toys "little paws with little jaws" is written on the package. </p>

<p>'He should never have been able to eat it in the chunks that he did. They became lodged in his gut, poor guy didn't stand a chance.</p>

<p>The two different packs of toys from B&amp;M, above, which the owner has labelled unsafe in a post shared to his Facebook, which gained over 14,000 shares and over 2,000 comments</p>

<p>He added: 'These are still in your local B&amp;M. [They] have told me that until they are proven to be unsafe they will continue to be sold.</p>

<p>'I do not wish for another pup or family to go through what little Stan and our family has. Please share this, spread the word.'</p>

<p>Joe's post has had over 14,000 shares and attracted over 2,000 comments from social media users.</p>

<p>One person wrote: 'So sorry to hear about Stanley. l have shared this in the hope it doesn't happen to another sweet fur baby.</p>

<p>Stanley, above, is said to have passed away two weeks ago following complications during surgery to remove parts of the toy</p>

<p>'Sending love and hugs.'</p>

<p>Another said: 'So sorry for you. B &amp; M should take more responsibility and do something about this.</p>

<p>'Until they have proof is no excuse. They need to take this more seriously.'</p>

<p>A third commented: 'He was beautiful, sue them, how many more will choke before they do anything about it.'</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that a dog owner has claimed their pet died after chewing on toys from the retailer.</p>

<p>In 2018, Lynn Barton from Liverpool watched her six-year-old labrador Maddie slip away after a major operation to remove parts of a £1.99 Christmas themed rubber toy from B&amp;M.</p>

<p>The beloved pooch was rushed to the vets after becoming ill and started vomiting up pieces of plastic.</p>

<p>An X-ray showed pieces of the festive toy were causing a major blockage in her stomach.</p>

<p>Maddie's owners had to make the heartbreaking decision to put their dog to sleep as complications from the surgery had left her stomach leaking digestive fluid.</p>

<p>MailOnline has reached out to B&amp;M for comment. </p>
