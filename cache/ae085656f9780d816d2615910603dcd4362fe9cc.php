<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>KyleÂ Walker has revealed his regret at breaking lockdown laws earlier this year after breaking his silence on the controversy that saw him branded a 'covidiot'.</p>

<p>The Manchester City star landed himself in hot water in April after hosting a party at his house during the height of the Government's lockdown measures.</p>

<p>In May, Walker broke regulations for a second time after driving to visit his parents and sister.</p>

<p>England's Kyle Walker (left) has broken his silence on controversially breaking lockdown rules</p>

<p>Walker (L) admitted regret over his behaviour and says he's taken responsibility for his actions</p>

<p>But the incidents didn't impact on Walker's performance post-lockdown, culminating in his England recall.</p>

<p>And speaking about the flashpoints, Walker said: 'Obviously me and the boss [Gareth Southgate] spoke after the lockdown incidents and, you know, he assured me that we all make mistakes.</p>

<p>'Obviously, mine was on a bigger scale and gets magnified with me being in the public eye and a role model to young children growing up, so I have to take full responsibility for my actions, which I have done.</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate named him in latest England squad after telling him 'we all make mistakes'</p>

<p>'But now I'm just moving on. I'm so happy to be here. It's lovely to see some of the lads again that you don't get to see so regular.' Walker was an integral member of the World Cup squad that finished fourth in 2018.</p>

<p>And Walker added: 'I think that's the standards that we set for ourselves as a team and as a country after what we produced in the World Cup.</p>

<p>'Would everyone have thought that we'd have got to a semifinals in a World Cup? Probably not.</p>

<p>'But I think that we changed the nation and how they perceive the England team now.' 'So, for me, it's an honour and a privilege to be here finally after so long, and just hopefully I can produce the goods on the training pitch.</p>

<p>'It's like you're coming in for the first time again, really, and I've got the excitement and that buzz around me and I just want to impress.'</p>
