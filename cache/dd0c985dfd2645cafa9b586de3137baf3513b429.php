<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Widespread evasion and avoidance of business rates is eating into the £25billion a year raised through the tax, the Treasury has said. </p>

<p>Some unscrupulous firms pretend to be charities while others falsely declare that their properties are empty. </p>

<p>The key target for those abusing the system is the near-£5billion of reliefs granted to businesses. The Government has expanded support for some companies through rate reliefs during the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>A sign of the times: Some unscrupulous firms pretend to be charities while others falsely declare that their properties are empty</p>

<p>It was already consulting on possible reforms to business rates. The tax has been long criticised for rising more rapidly than inflation. </p>

<p>In its consultation document issued last month, the Treasury wrote: 'There is evidence that some ratepayers are avoiding paying rates through the misuse of reliefs, particularly empty property relief.' </p>

<p>Some owners are granting leases on vacant properties to charities and are claiming that the properties will be used for charitable purposes when next in use. </p>

<p>The exemption for insolvent companies has been misused by leasing properties to dummy firms that are later declared to have gone bust. </p>

<p>Other owners claim rate relief on multiple properties in contravention of legislation. </p>

<p>The Treasury could not put a figure on the total amount of money lost, but said: 'The fundamental review of the business rates system will consider how the system can be made more robust to abuse.'</p>
