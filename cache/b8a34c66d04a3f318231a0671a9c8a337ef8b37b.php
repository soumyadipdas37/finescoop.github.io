<p>Yemini was reporting for fringe US media outlet Rebel News and doing a piece to camera in Albert Park on Saturday as police clashed with protesters.</p>

<p>As he was recounting the day's events, a police commander suddenly pointed him out and ordered officers to arrest him.</p>

<p>'This bloke here is not here for any purposeful reason, I want him under arrest right now,' the commander said, grabbing his microphone.</p>

<p>Right-wing commentator Avi Yemini was throw to the ground by police and arrested as he covered the anti-lockdown protests in Melbourne</p>

<p>Four officers then approached Yemini - who had media accreditation - and pushed him to the ground before handcuffing him, despite protests that his pass was in his pocket.</p>

<p>Unknown to the officers, Yemini's lapel microphone was still active and recorded police telling him he was arrested for hindering police.</p>

<p>However, footage released by Rebel News on Tuesday showed he was standing alongside several journalists who were also recording police and protesters.</p>

<p>He was soon released pending further inquiries, but given a move on notice from the area, ending his ability to report for the day.</p>

<p>Footage from earlier in the day showed Yemini and his crew showing their work permits and being let through a police checkpoint near the protest. </p>

<p>Yemini, who was reporting for Rebel News with a media pass, was doing a piece to camera in Albert Park on Saturday as police clashed with protesters</p>

<p>As he was recounting the day's events, a police commander suddenly pointed him out and ordered officers to arrest him</p>

<p>Before Yemini was released, his camera crew inadvertently recorded two reporters from Nine News and 7 News criticising police tactics on the day.</p>

<p>'Mate, I just almost got arrested,' Nine News reporter Mark Santomartino was heard saying to 7 News journalist Paul Dowsley.</p>

<p>'Same here, they threatened me with arrest, d**kheads,' Dowsley replied.</p>

<p>Dowsley said he was told he was 'in a police safe zone' and told 'don't be a f<strong>king smarta</strong>e' when he asked what that was and where he should go.</p>

<p>'Consistency, that's what you hope for - a clear consistent message,' he added, while Santomartino was equally unimpressed.</p>

<p>Dowsley was later confronted by Yemini and asked what he though about Yemini's arrest on camera but declined to comment while surrounded by police.</p>

<p>The veteran reporter was sent abuse on social media by Yemini's fans who said they hoped he was beaten up by police at the next protest.</p>

<p>Four officers then approached Yemini and pushed him to the ground before handcuffing him</p>

<p>Yemini was held on the ground for some time, despite his protests his work permit was in his pocket, before being led away in handcuffs</p>

<p>Footage from earlier in the day showed Yemini and his crew showing their work permits and being let through a police checkpoint near the protest</p>

<p>About 9pm on Saturday, police knocked on Yemini's door for a 'compliance check' to make sure he was home during the curfew.</p>

<p>Yemini angrily asked why he was being targeted and was told it was because he was 'on a list' due to his hindering caution earlier in the day.</p>

<p>'You're coming to my house with my kids in the middle of the night when I've never not complied, like any other journalist,' he told them.</p>

<p>Yemini has a long, chequered history as a far-right rabble rouser and holds strong anti-immigrant and anti-Islam views.</p>

<p>The former Israeli soldier ran a gym in Melbourne before moving on to run communications for fellow far-right activist Tommy Robinson in Britain.</p>

<p>He has since returned to Australia and fashioned himself as a political commentator on YouTube and for Rebel News and other fringe outlets.</p>

<p>His divisive rhetoric at one point got him banned from Facebook and assaulted by Muslim activist Sam Ekermawi.</p>

<p>Yemini was also convicted of throwing a chopping board at his wife Sarah Lyford's head in 2016 and of harassing her three times in 2017.</p>

<p>'It was like I didn't exist as a human being, I was just a vessel for his hatred... He terrorised me,' she told the court.</p>

<p>'What I will never forget is that he didn't flinch when it happened. He didn't ask if I was okay. He just walked by, I was left to tend to my own injuries and finish making the dinner.'</p>

<p>Yemini was also in 2016 sued for defamation by his own brother, anti-paedophile activist Manny Waks, for accusing Mr Waks and his father of 'harbouring a paedophile'. </p>
