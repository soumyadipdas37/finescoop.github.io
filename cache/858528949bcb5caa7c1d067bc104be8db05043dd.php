<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Emily Ratajkowski has revealed that she was sexually assaulted by a photographer during a nude shoot at his home in the Catskills in 2012. </p>

<p>In a piece written for The Cut, the now-29-year-old model recalled traveling to Jonathan Leder's home to pose for an unpaid editorial shoot arranged by her agent at the time - detailing how he photographed her both nude and in lingerie during the evening, before later assaulting her while they were sitting together on his couch.  </p>

<p>During the story, Ratajkowski - who was 20 at the time - recalled drinking copious amounts of red wine during the shoot, and notes that she was 'very, very drunk' by the end of the shoot. </p>

<p>Speaking out: Emily Ratajkowski has revealed she was assaulted by photographer Jonathan Leder during a nude shoot in 2012, when she was 20 years old </p>

<p>'I was cold, shivering, and huddled under a blanket,' she wrote. 'Jonathan and I were on his couch, and the rough texture of his jeans rubbed against my bare legs.'</p>

<p>Ratajkowski described how Leder began asking her about her 'boyfriends', and she says she 'remembers talking a lot... about her dating history', while 'absetnmindedly rubbing my feet against one another and against his for warmth'. </p>

<p>'He told me he liked “that foot thing you’re doing,” and I remember this moment more clearly than anything else,' she writes. </p>

<p>'Most of what came next was a blur except for the feeling,' Ratajkowski continues. 'I don’t remember kissing, but I do remember his fingers suddenly being inside of me. Harder and harder and pushing and pushing like no one had touched me before or has touched me since. </p>

<p>'I could feel the shape of myself and my ridges, and it really, really hurt. I brought my hand instinctively to his wrist and pulled his fingers out of me with force. I didn’t say a word. He stood up abruptly and scurried silently into the darkness up the stairs.'</p>

<p>When contacted by The Cut, Leder denied Ratajkowski's allegations, telling the publication that they were 'too tawdry and childish to respond to'. He continued: 'You do know who we are talking about right? This is the girl that was naked in Treats! magazine, and bounced around naked in the Robin Thicke video at that time. You really want someone to believe she was a victim?'</p>

<p>DailyMail.com has contacted a spokesperson for Jonathan Leder for comment.  </p>
