<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A leading barrister has been fined £750 after he suggested a judge only got her job because she was female and Asian.</p>

<p>Timothy Becker sent an email in which he said the woman - named as Deputy District Judge Hussain - had only been given the role because of 'positive discrimination'.</p>

<p>According to the Ministry of Justice, the only justice with that surname is Deputy District Judge Anitra Hussain, a former human rights barrister.</p>

<p>Mr Becker, the head of a central London chambers, accepted he was 'careless' with his language and admitted that anyone reading the email would know what he was implying.</p>

<p>Timothy Becker, pictured, the head of a central London chambers, accepted he was 'careless' with his language and admitted that anyone reading the email would know what he was implying</p>

<p>A hearing held by the Bar Tribunals and Adjudication Service heard there was initially disagreement as to whether Mr Becker intended the remarks to be racist.</p>

<p>Mr Becker, who is head of Burlington Chambers in Piccadilly, did not admit the charge of professional misconduct until the morning of the hearing.</p>

<p>He indicated he did not think his comments could be seen as racist or sexist.</p>

<p>Ms Evans, counsel for the Bar Standards Board, said it was irrelevant what Mr Becker intended by the remarks.</p>

<p>During the hearing Mr Becker accepted that sending the email would have diminished the trust and confidence the public had in him as a barrister.</p>

<p>The tribunal therefore decided it was unnecessary to determine whether he meant the remarks to be racist or not as it was professional misconduct regardless.</p>

<p>The tribunal said: 'Timothy Becker, on 18 August 2018, acting for the defendant in civil proceedings under the public access scheme, sent an email.</p>

<p>'[He] suggested to the [recipient] that the Deputy District Judge in those proceedings, who happened to be female and Asian, had only secured her position as a result of 'positive discrimination' in the judicial recruitment process.'</p>

<p>It went on to conclude: 'There can be no excuse for a member of the Bar to make such a statement, still less to make it in the course of litigation.</p>

<p>'The remarks were rude and wholly contrary to the Bar's commitment to equality.</p>

<p>'It is admitted by Mr Becker that a reasonable reader would have understood his remarks about DDJ Hussain being appointed as a consequence of 'positive discrimination' as a reference to her sex and/or race.</p>

<p>'He has now admitted that sending the email was likely to diminish the trust and confidence that the public places in him and the profession.</p>

<p>'As such, it is unnecessary for us to determine what meaning Mr Becker actually intended to convey.'</p>

<p>Mr Becker, who was called to the bar in 1992, was reprimanded by the tribunal and ordered to pay a fine of £750.</p>

<p>Judge Hussain, who has since been promoted to District Judge, is a former human rights barrister who was called to the bar in 1994.</p>

<p>The experienced advocate spends half her time teaching civil litigation and judicial review at The University of Law and the other half as a District Judge.</p>
