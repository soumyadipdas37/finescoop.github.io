<p>Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques looks set to face the axe following crisis talks over the destruction of two 46,000-year-old Aboriginal cave shelters.</p>

<p>The Mail understands that the feeling among non-executive directors was so strong that Jacques, who has led the mining group since 2016, cannot continue. </p>

<p>Rio has been taken aback by the outrage among shareholders and Australian politicians after it blew up the two sites in the Juukan Gorge, in Western Australia, in May to expand an iron ore mine.</p>

<p>Jacques has been facing demands to step down for several weeks after Rio Tinto was criticised for bungling its response to the crisis.</p>
