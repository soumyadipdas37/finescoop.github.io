<p>She recently told The Daily Telegraph: 'Obviously you have your partner, but it can actually feel like a really lonely process'.</p>

<p>'It is you and your body against all odds. Women don't really talk about it until after the fact. It can be really quite traumatic.'</p>

<p>In the same interview, her fiancée Hayley Willis, 30, revealed that she also hopes to carry a baby once Fiona has given birth. </p>

<p>Last outfit: For Fiona's final look of the day, she kept the same pair of jeans and changed her top into a navy blue striped shirt, teamed with black slide sandals</p>

<p>Hayley said: 'Fi is going first because she is older. I really want to carry a bub too but Fi will go first just because of the body clock on fertility, so her going first is best. </p>

<p>'I will give it a crack after we have our first child.' </p>

<p>Last month, the couple launched their podcast, What the IVF?!, which will document their fertility journey as a same-sex couple.</p>
