<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Alaska dentist who pulled out a patient's tooth while riding a hoverboard has been jailed for 12 years for reckless endangerment and a $1.9million Medicaid fraud. </p>

<p>Seth Lookhart joked about the hoverboard stunt in a video he sent to friends, and messages showed him bragging that nobody would ever uncover his crimes. </p>

<p>But he was was convicted in January of a 'lucrative' fraud scheme in which he pressured his patients to undergo unnecessary sedations so that he could send Medicaid the bill. </p>

<p>'In reviewing all this over and over again, I have this visceral response - you darn near killed some people,' Alaska judge Michael Wolverton told him on Monday, according to the Anchorage Daily News. </p>

<p>Dentist Seth Lookhart was filmed removing a patient's tooth while riding a hoverboard at Clear Creek Dental, in Anchorage, Alaska in July 2016 </p>

<p>In the hoverboard video, Lookhart balanced on the board while extracting a patient's tooth before cheerfully zooming away into the corridor. </p>

<p>Lookhart sent the video to friends and joked about the procedure being a 'new standard of care'. </p>

<p>Investigators tracked down the patient, Veronica Wilhelm, who was sedated and had no idea about the hoverboard stunt. </p>

<p>She testified in court last year that she was 'pretty livid' when she discovered what had happened. </p>

<p>'When did Dr Lookhart get your approval to take out your tooth on a hoverboard?,' prosecutor Joan Wilson asked in court.</p>

<p>'He never did. I obviously wouldn't have approved that. That's dangerous,' Wilhelm said in reply. </p>

<p>'If you were awake and not sedated when Dr Lookhart came into the operatory on a hoverboard, what would you have said to him?,' Wilson continued. </p>

<p>'I would've said hell no!,' Wilhelm said. 'No, that's unprofessional. It's crazy.'</p>

<p>She said: 'I think you have to be pretty narcissistic, you must be pretty full of yourself to think you can pull someone's tooth out on a hoverboard.' </p>

<p>During cross-examination, defense attorney Paul Stockler apologized to Wilhelm for the dentist's actions.</p>

<p>'I want you to know that as his lawyer, I apologize for what he did on that hoverboard,' he said. </p>

<p>'It's unacceptable and you can be assured that when I agreed to represent him, I got in his face and told him what I thought about him for doing this, which I think needed to be done.' </p>

<p>Pictured: Lookhart riding his hoverboard in Clear Creek Dental. Afterwards, he texted the video to several of his friends and the clip was used as evidence against him</p>

<p>Patient, Veronica Wilhelm (right), was sedated at the time with no idea she was being filmed or Lookhart was on a hoverboard </p>

<p>Wilhelm was also angered that Lookhart sedated her son for a teeth cleaning, she said at the time. </p>

<p>Prosecutors said the hoverboard stunt 'did not conform to minimum professional standards of dentistry'. </p>

<p>Lookhart admitted carrying out the hoverboard procedure, but had denied the Medicaid fraud of which he was eventually convicted in January. </p>

<p>Word of the fraud reached investigators in 2016 when a former employee told the state that Lookhart was profiting by performing more IV sedation than needed. </p>

<p>Prosecutors said he 'placed his patients in substantial risk of serious physical injury' by pressuring them into unnecessary sedations. </p>

<p>The state said that none of Lookhart's billings had proper justification, with the dentist giving vague and unacceptable reasons such as 'comfort' and 'anxiety'.  </p>

<p>Medicaid paid him $1.9million for IV sedation services, a third of the total paid to 57 practices in the state, and he fraudulently took $250,000 from his partners</p>

<p>As well as the fraud, Lookhart was convicted of misdemeanor counts of illegal practice of dentistry and reckless endangerment.  </p>

<p>The Anchorage Superior Court judge said he was particularly struck by numerous text messages in which Lookhart bragged to friends about his crimes.</p>

<p>Lookhart believed that unless 'someone was standing right next to him at the time, no one would ever know', the judge said. </p>

<p>The dentist also schemed to cut out his partners by billing Medicaid under a different provider identification and having payments sent directly to his home. </p>

<p>Since Lookhart obtained an intravenous sedation license in 2015, prosecutors said, Medicaid paid him about $1.9million for IV sedation services. </p>

<p>Lookhart apologized in court while reading a prepared statement.</p>

<p>'While I do not doubt that I was able to render care and alleviate the pain to many people who were in dire need, I also know that I could have and should have maintained better discipline and focus while serving a patient base I came to love,' he said.</p>

<p>Lookhart is scheduled to begin serving his sentence on December 7. His office manager, Shauna Cranford, is awaiting sentencing for her role in the scheme after accepting a plea deal. </p>
