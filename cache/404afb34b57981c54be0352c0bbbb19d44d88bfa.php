<p>Hard: Kate Ferdinand, 29, has admitted she's been battling with insecurities and still 'feels guilty' for slowing down during the early months of her pregnancy</p>

<p>Kate candidly revealed she's battled with anxiety and mental health struggles during her pregnancy, saying: 'I struggle with my mental health… being active helps me day-to-day with my anxiety...</p>

<p>'So when I can't do things, I really struggle with it…I want to do everything. Rio says to me 'Kate, just sit down. You just need to sit down and relax'. But I don't know why, I just feel guilty when I do. </p>

<p>'[Anxiety is] something I've suffered with from when I can remember. It can start over the simplest thing, and it's just my mind playing tricks on me and can get out of control. But I do find that when I exercise or go for a walk, I seem to feel better for the day.'</p>

<p>The star then admitted her mental health has taken a toll during her pregnancy as she's struggled to adjust to her changing body, especially during her first trimester.</p>

<p>She said: 'I am quite emotional. I feel a little bit insecure.</p>

<p>'I feel like not like me, and I struggled with that for a little while… feeling insecure with just how I look and my changing body, and I know it sounds very superficial… but struggling how to dress for this… Everything that you know has changed.'</p>

<p>Kate then added: 'The first three months I really, really struggled. I'm normally really active and I run around like a lunatic, just doing everything constantly. </p>

<p>'And I just couldn't… I couldn't get my head around being tired and not having the energy to go to the gym… But as I'm in the second trimester, I feel a bit more normal… I feel a bit more like myself.'</p>

<p>Asked how she's been managing and improving her mental health during her pregnancy, Kate explained she's tried to take regular breaks from social media.</p>

<p>She explained: 'I'm still not great at it, but I do try to remember that social media and other people's opinions is not me. I do try to have a break. </p>

<p>'I try to stay off it, and for quite a bit of my pregnancy I wasn't on social media. I just found I couldn't keep up with the kids, the holiday and everything. When I'm not on it I do feel happier.</p>

<p>'If you're not in the right mindset it can just be a negative place… People write some crazy stuff on there, and you can get caught up in it all.'</p>

<p>Earlier this month Kate and Rio revealed they're expecting a baby boy together, and the star admitted it came as a shock to stepdaughter Tia.</p>

<p>Emotional: She said: 'I couldn't get my head around being tired and not having the energy to go to the gym. But as I'm in the second trimester, I feel a bit more normal'</p>

<p>She told the podcast: 'Me and Tia are very out-numbered. It's going to be the fourth boy and she can't believe it. </p>

<p>'She looked like she was going to cry. She said: ''I really wanted a girl''…, but yeah another boy, more football boots, I suppose, I'm going to be at football matches for the rest of my life I think at this rate.'</p>

<p>Having spent a majority of her pregnancy in lockdown, Kate also spoke about the prospect of having to give birth with new restrictions.</p>

<p>Famiy: Kate is set to welcome her first child with husband Rio in the coming months, and is already stepmum to his three children Lorenz, 14, Tate, 11, and Tia, nine</p>

<p>She explained: 'Obviously we'd really like to take the kids (to the hospital appointments) so it's been a different experience to what you would imagine it to be. </p>

<p>'But we're just lucky we've got a healthy baby, so I'm trying not to focus on all that, and just record all the scans for the kids. </p>

<p>'We'll all watch it when we get home and put it on the TV…But I have seen a lot of things on social media about husbands not being allowed in for the birth, which seems crazy when people are down the pub.'</p>

<p>Kate and Rio, who married last year, announced their pregnancy on June 18, when Kate took to Instagram to share a heart-warming video of the moment they told their kids. </p>
