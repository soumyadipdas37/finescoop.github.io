<p>Amber Roach, 20, said she struggles to get out of bed, due to 'constant' back pain, get on buses or play sport because of her 34J breasts. </p>

<p>The 5ft 3in 9st law student, whose breasts way more than 1st alone, said visiting pubs and clubs has become a nightmare as she fears knocking over pints when she turns round.</p>

<p>Amber wants to reduce to a D cup but has been turned down for an NHS operation because her breasts fall under the size threshold, so she is hoping to raise £5,000 for the procedure. </p>

<p>Student Amber Roach, 20, from Watford, Hertfordshire, has one of the biggest busts in the UK and is crowdfunding to have her breasts reduced</p>

<p>She said she can't walk down the street without having to squeeze past people and struggles going into boutiques without knocking things over.</p>

<p>Amber told The Sun: 'Everyone always thinks of big boobs as a good thing and I know, in so many ways, I am blessed. But the truth is they are ruining my life.'</p>

<p>She said medical experts have not taken her size eight frame into account when deciding whether to give her an NHS operation. </p>

<p>The former county-level athlete from Watford, Hertfordshire, is single and hates being treated as an object and the laddish comments she receives. </p>

<p>Amber says she can't walk down the street without having to squeeze past people and struggles going into boutiques without knocking things over</p>

<p>She said: 'It’s so difficult to be taken seriously, especially by men because they are just talking to my boobs all the time. But men are the last reason I am doing this.</p>

<p>'I need to be able to live a normal life before I can even think about a bloke.'</p>

<p>Amber used to play county netball at school as well as football, rugby, trampolining and athletics 1,500m and 400m.</p>

<p>But she has been unable to run for three years and even then she had to wear two bras.</p>

<p>Writing on her fundraising page, Amber said: 'I am hoping to get a reduction on the basis that my back is in constant agony'</p>

<p>She said even sitting down has become difficult and she struggles during lectures having to rest her breasts on her desk.</p>

<p>Amber gets her huge assets from her mother's side of the family, with her aunt and sister also struggling but have larger frames.</p>

<p>She has had physio since being E-cup as a teen and was warned she may need a wheelchair in the future if the strain on her lower back is not eased.</p>

<p>Writing on her fundraising page, Amber said: 'I am hoping to get a reduction on the basis that my back is in constant agony. </p>

<p>The former county-level athlete is single and hates being treated as an object and the laddish comments she receives</p>

<p>'It has to support the extra 1.1stone on my chest. This causes the bottom half of my back to slowly wear away whilst my upper back is overworking, which has caused an imbalance in my posture. </p>

<p>'I was told by my physio in 2014 that if I do not follow an exercising routine for my back, that I will have severe issues before my 40s.</p>

<p>'I have recently contacted my Doctor addressing my pain and I now frequently take paracetamol, Naproxen and Codeine all day every day. This is not healthy.' </p>

<p>So far, her fundraiser has raised more than £800 of its £5,000 goal. </p>
