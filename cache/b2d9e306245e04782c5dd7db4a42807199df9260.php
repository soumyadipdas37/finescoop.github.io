<p>The measures come as UKA face up to the cost of their weakened broadcasting situation. The weekend's national championships was the last event on a deal with the BBC that was worth upwards of £2million a year. </p>

<p>While renewal talks with the BBC are ongoing and dialogue has started with at least two other broadcasters, the figures are at a vastly reduced rate, with the knock-on effect that UKA CEO Joanna Coates has admitted they could be forced cut loose one or both of Britain's two Diamond League events to make ends meet.</p>

<p>The British Championships were the final event of a broadcast deal worth £2million a year</p>

<p>Coates has now notified staff that personnel cuts will be forthcoming. In a statement on Wednesday she said: 'This announcement today is difficult news for some but also essential for the health of the sport moving forwards.</p>

<p>'There are a number of factors that have meant we need to reduce our head count, not being able to stage our biggest events this summer will obviously have had a significant financial impact as will the changing face of our broadcast arrangements.</p>

<p>'But it's important to note that regardless of these issues the business would still have seen a lot of changes take place at this time. As a sport we are rebuilding, and I have often used the term needing a "rewire". Whilst change can be incredibly difficult, it is also an opportunity for us to ensure we are a healthy governing body, with a long-term strategy delivering successfully through to 2032.'</p>
