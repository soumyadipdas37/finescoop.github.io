<p>The man lived near the Barragem da Bravura reservoir (pictured) which was once searched by police in the hunt for Maddie, though local reports suggest they never went in the water</p>

<p>Presenter Sandra Felgueiras says: 'German detectives have confirmed the suspicion that Christian Brueckner had an accomplice.' </p>

<p>The journalist shows pictures of Brueckner former girlfriend Nicole Fehlinger to a witness who lived in the Algarve at the time of Madeleine's disappearance.</p>

<p>She speaks to Brueckner's lawyer Friedrich Fuelcher who claims that his client has been made a scapegoat by German prosecutors who have the flimsiest evidence.</p>

<p>And the lawman claims the German authorities main witness Helge Brusching is a convicted criminal and therefore unreliable.</p>

<p>However prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters tells Ms Felgueiras that he has substantive evidence that Madeleine McCann is dead.</p>

<p>Meanwhile reports suggest that detectives want to talk to a German man who is believed to have been a former friend of Brueckner at the time of Madeleine's disappearance.</p>

<p>The drifter lived in a camper van near a remote reservoir nine miles from Praia da Luz., called Barragem de Bravura.</p>

<p>The man - who is wanted by German prosecutors - is thought to be a German drifter who lived in the Algarve with Brueckner (pictured, a camper van that Brueckner used)</p>

<p>Madeleine went missing from a holiday apartment where she was staying in Pria da Luz in Potugal in 2007 (file image) and has not been seen since</p>

<p>The area was searched in the days after Madeleine's disappearance.</p>

<p>But local news reports said police spent only two hours there and the lake was not searched by police divers.</p>

<p>A note handed found in Praia da Luz claimed that Madeleine's body had been dumped at the Barragem da Bravura reservoir.</p>

<p>The message was written in Portuguese and was handed to police a year after she disappeared.</p>

<p>Christian Brueckner, who is currently in jail on drugs offences, lived in ramshackle cottage just 15-mintues-drive from the holiday apartment in Praia da Luz from where Madeleine McCann went missing in May 2007.</p>

<p>Mobile phone evidence places Brueckner in the tourist village on the night the youngster disappeared.</p>

<p>He has been linked to a series of 25 break-ins throughout the resort and has been convicted for the rape of an elderly American tourist in the resort, although the sentence has still to be confirmed.</p>

<p>Bruecker has been convicted of a string of sex crimes, including the sexual assault of children.</p>
