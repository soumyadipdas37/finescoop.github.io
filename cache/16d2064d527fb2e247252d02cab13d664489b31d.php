<p>Upon closer inspection, it was identified as an eastern grey kangaroo who had gotten stuck in the seven metre deep pit filled with industrial ooze </p>

<p>'The words that were expressed to me was probably not suitable for your publication. It was all pretty freaky to be honest,' Mr Halemba told Yahoo News Australia.</p>

<p>The pair soon realised the animal was an eastern grey kangaroo, which was covered in a thick mix of oil, bitumen and sawdust after becoming trapped in the pit.   </p>

<p>Animal rescuers were contacted, but the pair could not wait around for them watching the struggling animal. </p>

<p>They created a noose to help bring the kangaroo out of the seven-metre deep pit. </p>

<p>'We essentially made up a noose, dropped it into the pit with a little bit of finesse, and a couple of broomstick handles,' Mr Halemba said. </p>

<p>The pulled the roo out, wrapped the marsupial with a towel and gave him some water.</p>

<p>Mr Halemba said the kangaroo was not happy and kept 'hissing' at him following its ordeal in the pit. </p>

<p>Wildlife Rescuer volunteer Leone Sorrentino said the kangaroo had to be euthanised after being stuck in the pit and consuming the content</p>

<p>Wildlife Rescuers Inc volunteer Leone Sorrentino arrived and was shocked at the sight in front of her.  </p>

<p>She said the kangaroo was 'very angry, very distressed' after digesting some of the sludge. </p>

<p>Ms Sorrentino was heartbroken and had no choice but to euthanise the marsupial, which had no hope of survival. </p>

<p>'It was just horrific, these last moments of his life, and he's in some pit,' she said. </p>

<p>She suggested covers be placed over pits to ensure the incident isn't repeated. </p>
