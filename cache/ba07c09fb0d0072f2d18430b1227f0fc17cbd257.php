<p>Novak Djokovic will make a quick return to action next week after his default from the US Open</p>

<p>His co-coach Goran Ivanisevic says his punishment after striking a line judge is an injustice</p>

<p>'Yes there are rules but taking into consideration that Novak didn't have any intention, and with corona and everything, they shouldn't have defaulted him.'</p>

<p>Ivanisevic criticised what he felt was a sense of schadenfreude in some part of the tennis world after his player's demise.</p>

<p>'What I find tragic is that many people act like they were just waiting for him to do something wrong. There is a lot of maliciousness and a lot of people happy that someone else is in trouble. Some of the media are out to get him and I really don't know why that is.'</p>

<p>Djokovic has travelled to Rome and will play in next week's Italian Open, where he will be accompanied by long-time mentor Marian Vajda.</p>
