<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lautaro Martinez's future is at Inter Milan, insists the club's vice-president Javier Zanetti.</p>

<p>The Argentine forward has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona this summer and that has only intensified amid the expected departure of Luis Suarez to Juventus.</p>

<p>But club legend Zanetti has moved to quash any fears that Inter will lose the hotshot striker who formed such an effective partnership with Romelu Lukaku last season.</p>

<p>Lautaro Martinez has been heavily linked with a move to Barcelona from Inter Milan</p>

<p>He insists the 23-year-old is happy in Italy, despite the links of a move to Barca, two years after he joined Inter from Racing Club. </p>

<p>'Lautaro isn't leaving Inter,' Zanetti told Fox Sports, via Marca.</p>

<p>'It's not just Barcelona who are interested in him, but Lautaro knows that he's at a great club already.</p>

<p>'He looks happy with life in Italy, which isn't easy. I think he's going down the right path. For now, he's not leaving. He's our present and future. There's respect on the clubs' part.</p>

<p>Vice-president Javier Zanetti insists that Martinez remains happy with life in Italy</p>

<p>Martinez ended a successful season with the disappointment of Europa League final defeat</p>

<p>'There are players that have release clauses and there's little you can do when a club comes in and pays it. But in Lautaro's case, he's just fine at Inter and I can tell when he's happy.'</p>

<p>Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo reported earlier this week that Barcelona are weighing up a move for Lyon star Memphis Depay as a cheaper alternative to Martinez.</p>

<p>They claimed that Barcelona had agreed a deal in principle with the Inter Milan striker.</p>

<p>However due to the economic context of the coronavirus crisis and the Serie A club's 'unwillingness' to sell him for less than £98.9m, this has meant that talks have stopped between the two sides.</p>

<p>Martinez scored 21 times in 49 appearances last season and helped Antonio Conte's side reach the Europa League final, where they were beaten in a thriller by Sevilla.</p>
