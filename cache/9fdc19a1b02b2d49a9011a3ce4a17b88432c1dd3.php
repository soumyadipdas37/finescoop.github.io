<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New Jersey authorities have charged seven teens in connection to an August break-in at an animal farm that led to a viral photo of one of the alleged teens riding a miniature donkey. </p>

<p>The Wyckoff Police Department shared in a Tuesday release that the group was charged with trespassing, criminal mischief, and overloading animals. </p>

<p>Charged in the group were three 17-year-old boys, three 17-year-old girls and an 18-year-old male. </p>

<p>None of the suspects were named in the release.  </p>

<p>Wycoff police have charged seven teens in connection to the break-in at Abma's Farm on August 22. A young girl identified as a 17-year-old student-athlete at River Dell High School in Bergen County, New Jersey, was photographed riding a miniature donkey at the barnyard petting zoo</p>

<p>All of the cases for the minors will be handled in the Superior Court, the Daily Voice reports. </p>

<p>The adult will be tried in the Municipal Court.  </p>

<p>The investigation was led by Detective Sgt. Michael Ragucci and Detective Sgt. Kevin Kasak.   </p>

<p>On August 22, Jimmy Abma, a fourth-generation farmer whose family has owned Abma’s Farm in Wyckoff, New Jersey, for more than 80 years, received the message on his phone about the group's activities. </p>

<p>It showed a young girl riding on a miniature donkey.</p>

<p>Abma recognized the animal, which he confirmed to be his after seeing that the Snapchat image also had the caption ‘Abma’s Farm’ attached toward the bottom.</p>

<p>The owner of Abma's Farm, Jimmy Abma (above), received the image of the girl riding the donkey at around 10:30pm on August 22. That's when he sped toward the petting zoo and chased the teens away</p>

<p>Abma temporarily closed the barnyard so that veterinary staff could do a wellness check on the animals. The image above shows one of the animals being tended to by a veterinarian</p>

<p>Abma's Farm has been owned and operated by the family for more than 80 years</p>

<p>He also grew concerned since the miniature donkeys on his property are not big enough to support the weight of a teenager.</p>

<p>‘Obviously, we’re closed, so that raised a concern to me right off the bat, that there’s people trespassing, the animals are somewhat in danger and I just need to figure out what’s going on,’ he told WCBS-TV.</p>

<p>Abma, who lives on the property, said he immediately ran outside and chased at least half a dozen youngsters off of his property, which includes a barnyard petting zoo, a farm, and a supermarket.</p>

<p>He was shocked to discover that the gates to the petting zoo were open and some of the animals had been traumatized.</p>

<p>One pony had lipstick spread on its face.</p>

<p>Abma said that all of the animals have been accounted for</p>

<p>Abma said several of the animals were left traumatized by the experience</p>

<p>‘Couple of the animals you couldn’t even get close to,’ Abma said. 'They were all skittish. They were all jumping around.</p>

<p>‘We did a full count on the animals and we’re still trying to account for all of them so it’s just a frustrating thing.’</p>

<p>He added: ‘These animals, they have the ability to kick and rear up and they have the ability to bite you.’</p>

<p>Abma also said he noticed two teens trying to shoplift items from his supermarket.</p>

<p>As he dialed 911, the two teenagers ran off. </p>

<p>On Facebook, Abma wrote that all of the animals were accounted for and that the barnyard would be closed to allow a veterinarian to come to the property to conduct a wellness check.</p>

<p>Abma posted an image on Facebook the following Monday showing a veterinarian checking up on one of the donkeys. </p>
