<p>Pop culture moment: The Wedding Singer star mentioned the long-held influence of music videos when she took the virtual stage, presenting the award for best music video direction</p>

<p>The prize made history as only the second video direction VMA to be awarded to a woman, no less to TSwift herself for one of her first forays into solo directing. </p>

<p>The 2020 MTV Video Music Awards were originally scheduled to be held at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, before the coronavirus pandemic forced organizers to re-think the entire event.</p>

<p>This year's show marks the first time the bash has been held at various different locations, with performances taking place in and around New York City, without packed audiences to abide by social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>MTV explained its plans for the show to ‘[span] all five boroughs’ of New York, to ‘pay homage to the strength, spirit and incredible resilience of NYC and its beloved residents.’</p>

<p>Honored: Drew ended up bestowing the honor of Best Direction to Taylor Swift, for her video off of last year's Lover album, The Man</p>
