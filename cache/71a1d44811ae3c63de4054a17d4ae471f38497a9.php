<p>Lieutenant Commander Jim Blythe, the commanding officer of HMS Medway, said: 'The Royal Navy and the US Coast Guard have prevented a significant quantity of drugs crossing the Caribbean that could have been destined for the streets of the UK.'</p>

<p>Armed forces minister James Heappey said: 'The Royal Navy task group deployed to support our overseas territories during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>'They stayed in the Caribbean to respond to damage caused by hurricanes and now they're making drugs busts alongside our friends in the US Coast Guard.</p>

<p>'This is amazing work from our people after months away from home.'</p>

<p>Sailors, Royal Marines and the US Coast Guard team on board support ship RFA Argus hauled 11 bales of cocaine weighing 358kg in the first of three busts in seven days.</p>

<p>A Navy spokesman said: 'In the first success, an American maritime patrol aircraft spotted a suspicious vessel riding low in the water and reported it to Argus, which immediately changed course to investigate.</p>

<p>'The 28,000-tonne vessel used squalls as cover to stay out of sight and avoid raising suspicion - while her boarding team of Royal Marines of 47 Commando and the US Coast Guard prepared to strike.</p>

<p>'On approaching the target craft, the Royal Marines were spotted and the suspect vessel's crew started to throw their illegal cargo overboard.'</p>

<p>Because the boat was unrecoverable, soldiers from 24 Commando Royal Engineers used explosives to blow the bottom out of the small boat to avoid it becoming a hazard</p>

<p>'The crew of the intercepted vessel were brought back to RFA Argus along with their seized cargo before being transferred to US Coast Guard cutter Spencer.'</p>

<p>A spokesman added that because the boat was unrecoverable, soldiers from 24 Commando Royal Engineers used explosives to blow the bottom out of the small boat to avoid it becoming a hazard.</p>

<p>Medway was involved in intercepting the other two smuggling vessels a few days later, leading to the arrest of six people, the spokesman added.</p>
