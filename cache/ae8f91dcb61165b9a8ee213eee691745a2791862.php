<p>With coronavirus cases on the rise again in England, government officials are set to take action and impose tighter Covid-19 restrictions in a bid to prevent a second wave of infections across the country.</p>

<p>Social gatherings of more than six people is set to be banned in England from Monday which would likely see sporting events suffer a huge setback in getting fans back into stadiums.</p>

<p>Football supporters fear that plans to return to stadiums next month will be shelved</p>

<p>Johnson announced in July that spectators would be able to attend live sporting events in person from October as the country edged towards a sense of normality.</p>

<p>However, new lockdown rules could put these plans on the back-burner on Wednesday afternoon, leaving sports supporters distraught at the thought.</p>

<p>One Twitter user questioned what would happen to smaller clubs if they will be made to wait for gate revenue once again.</p>

<p>The tweet read: 'Don’t think it’s looking good for fans getting back into football stadiums next month. I wonder if #CUFC will knock this weeks season ticket payments on the head. Really don’t know how some clubs are going to survive this. Grim.'</p>

<p>Boris Johnson is expected to provide an update on fan pilot events on Wednesday afternoon</p>

<p>Another suggested that fans shouldn't be given hope of any sort of a return unless a vaccine has been found for the virus.</p>

<p>Twitter user <?php echo e('@'); ?>PiiaMay said: 'So the UK all in again for more restrictions? Yeah.. that's why Fans back in the stadiums won't happen there. That's why it shouldn't happen anywhere unless there's a vaccine. This virus is still out there and people act like it isn't.'</p>

<p>Up until this week, many sports, including football, have been holding test pilot events in an attempt to get fans back into grounds.</p>

<p>Brighton welcomed 2,500 fans into the Amex Stadium for their friendly with Chelsea last month, while sports like snooker and rugby have also had spectators attend.</p>

<p>Football fans on Twitter questioned whether spectators would be back in stadiums next month</p>

<p>Horse racing is also looking to make the transition back but will also likely be affected by the new rules.</p>

<p>The crowd pilot at Doncaster on Wednesday will still go ahead as normal where over 3,000 paying spectators will be allowed in to watch the action.</p>

<p>The intention has been to allow a small number of paying spectators into the racecourse every day of the meeting which culminates in the St Leger on Saturday when there would be a crowd of over 5,000. </p>
