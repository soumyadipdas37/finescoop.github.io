<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Some 25million savers have been dealt with a hammer blow after National Savings &amp; Investments announced savage cuts to its rates from the end of November.</p>

<p>And it's not just old hands who have saved with the nation's bank for years, millions of new savers will have signed up for its market-leading accounts since March and poured in billions of pounds.</p>

<p>NS&amp;I's decision to reverse planned cuts to its easy-access rates in April effectively left it as a best buy destination - savings rates plummeted elsewhere throughout the months of lockdown at a time when some were left with more money to save but fewer places offering inflation-beating homes.</p>

<p>NS&amp;I will take the hammer to its currently market-leading savings accounts from November</p>

<p>But as a result, the Treasury-backed bank normally used to sitting in the middle of the savings pack was left alone at the top, and deluged with billions of pounds in deposits over the last six months, leaving it on the verge of smashing its fundraising target just halfway through its financial year.</p>

<p>This has left it having to slash rates to the bone, and savers short-changed. But where can they go now to avoid losing out?</p>

<p>NS&amp;I's Direct Saver currently pays 1 per cent with no restrictions or limits on withdrawals, but from 24 November this will plunge to just 0.1 per cent, a fall of £85 interest on savings of £10,000.</p>

<p>Savers will unfortunately have to take a hit if they want to move their money, as most accounts paying comparable rates in This is Money's best buy tables come with either time-limited bonus rates or limits on withdrawals.</p>

<p>The top rate overall is 1.2 per cent from Coventry Building Society, and this has a two limit withdrawal per year.  </p>

<p>The best account which doesn't have either is Principality Building Society's Web Saver, which pays a slightly lower 0.8 per cent interest rate on savings of at least £1. It can be opened online.</p>

<p>However, with the provider a Welsh building society rather than the banking arm of the British Treasury, expect the account to be pulled from sale fairly quickly or the rate to be cut if NS&amp;I savers deposit their money en-masse.</p>

<p>NS&amp;I's Income Bonds are an easy-access account in that savers can add or withdraw money whenever they want, but it pays 1.15 per cent monthly interest so it deserves its own category.</p>

<p>It is suffering the heaviest cut of all NS&amp;I products, and from November will pay just £1 interest on £10,000 of savings, or just 0.01 per cent.</p>

<p>Luckily for savers, provided they move quickly, Coventry Building Society on Monday launched an account paying 1.2 per cent interest a year, or 1.19 per cent a month, which actually overtook NS&amp;I at the top of the best buy tables.</p>

<p>The Double Access account can be opened with £1 online but money can be further deposited by cash or cheque with Britain's second-largest building society. </p>

<p>While it only allows withdrawals twice a year without penalty, savers receiving monthly payouts may be willing to embrace that as a compromise.</p>

<p>However, savers again need to move fast, with an account paying 1.2 per cent launched last Tuesday by Skipton Building Society, the first provider to dare to overtake NS&amp;I's Income Bonds since mid-May, being withdrawn two days' later after what the mutual called 'unprecedented demand'.</p>

<p>For a while NS&amp;I's cash Isa was alone at the top of the tax-free best buy tables, with the best catch-free rate paying as little as 0.65 per cent interest, as NS&amp;I's account does not accept previous years' transfers.</p>

<p>However, over the last two months tax-free rates have recovered somewhat along with the rest of the savings of the market, although it remains to be seen if NS&amp;I's cuts see those green shoots wither.</p>

<p>As a result, four easy-access Isas currently match or beat 0.9 per cent and all accept transfers, with NS&amp;I's account set to fall by 0.8 percentage points in two months' time.</p>

<p>Savers have plenty of options, with the best rate available 0.96 per cent and offered online by Coventry Building Society. Savers can only make three withdrawals a year.</p>

<p>Skipton Building Society pays 0.95 per cent on an online cash Isa which comes with a 12-month bonus of 0.5 per cent, with the rate falling to 0.45 per cent after that time.</p>

<p>Principality Building Society also pays 0.95 with no bonus, and Cynergy Bank 0.9 per cent.</p>

<p>While it didn't go through with cuts to its easy-access accounts in May, NS&amp;I's fixed-rate accounts did face the chop, and are set to do so again.</p>

<p>Its one, two, three and five-year Growth and Income Bonds will be cut from 24 November for customers whose accounts mature after that date, while its two and five-year fixed-interest savings certificates will also be cut.</p>

<p>Focusing on its one and two-year Growth Bonds, the best rates on those terms available with NS&amp;I, they will fall from 1.1 per cent and 1.2 per cent to 0.1 per cent and 0.15 per cent, respectively.</p>

<p>This is a fall of roughly £100 and £105 a year in interest on £10,000 of savings for existing savers who would choose to roll over their Bonds, which are no longer available to new customers.</p>

<p>These can easily be beaten elsewhere, with the best one-year fixed-rate paying 1.3 per cent from Paragon Bank on £1,000 or more and the best two-year fixed-rate from Aldermore Bank paying 1.36 per cent, also on £1,000.</p>

<p>Paragon's fixed-rate bonds can be opened online and by post, while Aldermore's can be opened online.</p>

<p>For those looking to replace their Income Bonds, which pay interest monthly, both banks offer monthly interest options, with Paragon paying 1.29 per cent monthly interest and Aldermore Bank 1.35 per cent.</p>

<p>Parents who entrusted their children's savings to NS&amp;I will be dealt a serious blow from November as the rate is cut from a market-leading 3.25 per cent to 1.5 per cent.</p>

<p>A £5,000 lump sum earning 3.25 per cent interest a year over half a decade would see £880.95 added over that time.</p>

<p>However this would fall to £389.17 with the lower rate, a difference of nearly £500 over five years.</p>

<p>Coventry Building Society offers the next-best Junior Isa, which pays 2.95 per cent interest. It can be opened by post, in-branch or over the phone with £1, and accepts transfers from an existing Junior Isa or Child Trust Fund.</p>

<p>A lump sum of £5,000 would earn £793.62 in interest over five years.</p>

<p>All rates correct as of 22th September 2020 - rates in the current environment can chop and change fast. </p>

<p>NS&amp;I pays a top rate of 1.15%  on its easy access monthly income account. The minimum deposit is £500.</p>

<p>Saga pays  0.75%  AER interest on its easy access account for 12 months, which can be opened with a minimum of £1. Only available to over 50s.</p>

<p>Al Rayan pays  0.75% expected profit rate on its two year fixed Isa. The minimum deposit required is £1,000. The bank is Sharia compliant.</p>

<p>Shawbrook Bank  pays a rate of  1.10% AER interest on its five year fixed-rate cash Isa. The minimum deposit required is £1,000.</p>

<p>Charter Savings Bank pays a table-topping  1.26%  AER interest on its three year fixed-rate savings account. It requires £5,000 to open.</p>
