<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nicola Gobbo boasted of having a fling with former AFL star Brendan Fevola in explosive messages she sent to her sister.</p>

<p>The double-dealing lawyer exchanged texts with her sibling Catherine back in August 2010, accusing a police officer she refers to as 'Slimey' of 'interfering' in her relationship with the former Carlton and Brisbane player.  </p>

<p>The text messages are detailed in Ms Gobbo's submission to the Royal Commission into the Management of Police Informants.</p>

<p>Ms Gobbo alleged she had a sexual relationship with Jeff Pope - the senior officer who was her handler when she was registered as an informer in 1999. </p>

<p>Ms Gobbo submitted text messages to the Lawyer X royal commission where she claimed she had a fling with AFL star Brendan Fevola (pictured, left, with his wife Alex)</p>

<p>The text exchange began when Gobbo saw Mr Pope an television, telling her sister she could remember him from her 'alcohol fling days'.  </p>

<p>'Definitely him. Multiple times... Perhaps I should write to Slimey? Or leave it to 4 Corners instead,' Gobbo wrote to Catherine on August 26, 2010.</p>

<p>According to the submission, Gobbo's sister mentioned Four Corners, Ben Cousins and Fevola in her reply. </p>

<p>Gobbo sent another text message back, where she alleged to have had a sexual relationship with Fevola.</p>

<p>'You are correct as usual. Momentarily forgot about Slimey interfering with my sex life re the Fev.</p>

<p>'What a f***ing disgrace that Pope didn't declare his frolicking to his bosses.</p>

<p>'I even remember when he bought his house in [a Melbourne suburb] 10 years ago!' </p>

<p>The commission stated Gobbo's alleged sexual relationship with Mr Pope cannot be proven. </p>

<p>Mr Pope denies ever having a sexual relationship with Ms Gobbo. </p>

<p>Ms Gobbo sent another text message to her sister, where she alleged to have had a sexual relationship with AFL star 'Fev'</p>

<p>Gobbo was registered as an informer three times, her longest stint between 2005-09 when she helped police bring down a number of her former clients, including Tony Mokbel and Carl Williams.</p>

<p>Jailed underworld figure Mokbel is one of nearly a dozen people currently appealing convictions they claim were tainted by Ms Gobbo's informing.</p>

<p>He spent 15 months on the run after fleeing his 2006 drug trial, in which more than 15 million pills hidden in tomato cans from Italy.</p>

<p>Evidence suggests both federal and state prosecution agencies knew Ms Gobbo was working as an informer during the trafficking case.  </p>

<p>Zlate Cvetanovski was freed on bail while he awaits his appeal, after spending almost a decade in jail, while Faruk Orman had his murder conviction quashed by Victoria's Court of Appeal last year.</p>

<p>Victoria Police sensationally apologised for the gangland barrister's involvement as a police informant, and said steps had been taken to ensure it could 'never happen again'.  </p>

<p>'It was an indefensible interference in the lawyer/client relationship, a relationship that is essential to the proper functioning of the criminal justice system and to the rule of law,' a police spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>'Our failure at that time to ensure that these circumstances were identified and disclosed was also a significant and missed opportunity to right a wrong.' </p>

<p>'We have taken steps to make sure that what happened with Ms Gobbo can never happen again.'</p>
