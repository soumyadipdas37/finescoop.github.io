<p>She squirmed and raised her arms while Kylie tried to get everyone to look at the camera and Travis just just grinned.</p>

<p>'Mmhmm, sure am,' Kris replied.</p>

<p>Although the two couldn't escape the news that their long-running series would be coming to an end, neither mentioned it and instead focused on their family time together.</p>
