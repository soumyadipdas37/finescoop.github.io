<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho has advised Danny Rose to jump at the chance of a transfer to Genoa.</p>

<p>Mourinho believes the proposed move to Serie A in Italy would work well for both clubs and a 30-year-old player in the final year of his contract at Tottenham.</p>

<p>He made it clear that Rose, who is back after a loan spell at Newcastle last season, is behind Ben Davies and Ryan Sessegnon in the battle to be the Spurs left-back and knows he is someone who wants to play every week.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has advised Danny Rose (left) to jump at the chance of a transfer to Genoa</p>

<p>Mourinho's comments come after the Amazon Prime documentary revealed their prior clash</p>

<p>'If Genoa gets Danny Rose, I think they get a good player,' said Mourinho. 'If they get a good player in the last year of his contract, I think they're in a privilege position to do a good deal for them. And if Danny Rose goes there, I wish him all the best.</p>

<p>'It's one of the things that was very clear you that you could learn from one of the Amazon bits is that Danny is the kind of guy who wants to play all the time.'</p>

<p>The documentary series All or Nothing: Tottenham Hotspur, out now on Amazon Video, detailed a frank exchange of views between the pair in January.</p>

<p>Rose told Mourinho in January that he would stay at home if he was not wanted at Tottenham</p>

<p>Mourinho left Rose of the squad for a game at Watford and the England left-back told him he would stay at home if he was not wanted.</p>

<p>'Some players are more adapted to belong to a squad with lots of quality where the competition is higher,' said the Spurs boss on Friday.</p>

<p>'Other players are only happy if they are in a club where they play all the time.</p>

<p>Mourinho has now made it clear he is behind Ben Davies (left) and Ryan Sessegnon at Spurs</p>

<p>'It's very difficult for him to stay here with us when for me it's clear that Ben Davies is such a solid left-back, Ryan Sessesgnon is an investment by the club, an emerging player that we want to improve.</p>

<p>'So it's very difficult for Danny to stay with us this season. If he goes to Serie A and Genoa I think it'll be very good for him.'</p>

<p>Rose is in talks with Genoa, who narrowly avoided relegation from the top tier of Italian football last season.</p>
