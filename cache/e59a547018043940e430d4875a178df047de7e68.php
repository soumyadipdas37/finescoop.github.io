<p>The 32-year-old reality star rocked a white bodycon dress with a matching duster as she cradled her growing stomach for the sweet family snap.</p>

<p>Clark and Schroeder had to put their Italian wedding plans on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic and announced they were expecting a baby girl in June. </p>

<p>Blessed: Stassi Schroeder shared a '25 week' baby bump update with fiance Beau Clark on Instagram Monday afternoon</p>

<p>'25 weeks. Our Clark Passenger is poppin,' she captioned the snap to her two million followers on Instagram.</p>

<p>Stassi appeared in great spirits just days after sitting down for her first interview since being fired from Vanderpump Rules following a racism scandal. </p>

<p>Schroeder branded herself a 'Karen' when speaking to Tamron Hall about a racially motivated incident that resurfaced earlier this year where she reported her black co-star Faith Stowers to the police in 2018 for a crime she did not commit.</p>

<p>Hall said she was 'shocked' at her 'level of ignorance as it relates to race,' specifically because she is from New Orleans and lives in Los Angeles, both of which are highly populated, diverse cities.</p>

<p>Yikes: Schroeder branded herself a 'Karen' when speaking to Tamron Hall about a racially motivated incident that resurfaced earlier this year where she reported her black co-star Faith Stowers to the police in 2018 for a crime she did not commit</p>

<p>'And when you're on a show like Vanderpump Rules, your existence on that show is kinda dependent on sticking your nose in other people's conflict or creating conflict,'she said</p>

<p>During the interview, Hall point blank asked her: 'You saw a grainy photo. Why did you think that that was Faith Stowers? Or did you really?'</p>

<p>'Yes I did. And it wasn't just the photo. Kristen [Doute] and I had received texts from multiple people about this,' Schroeder claimed.</p>

<p>The star added that 'there were people that Kristen knew who were texting her' about a women who stole 'from us and we think its this person in the article and she's saying she's on your television show and her name is Faith.'</p>

<p>Schroeder said: 'And when you're on a show like Vanderpump Rules, your existence on that show is kinda dependent on sticking your nose in other people's conflict or creating conflict.' </p>

<p>During the interview, Hall point blank asked her: 'You saw a grainy photo. Why did you think that that was Faith Stowers? Or did you really?'</p>

<p>'I look back at that podcast and I'm so embarrassed that I even had those thoughts, much less put it out there. Because I was that...' Schroeder said, looking visibly nervous</p>

<p>Both Stassi and Kristen — who have starred on Pump Rules since 2013 — were fired from their roles on the popular Bravo program.</p>

<p>'I look back at that podcast and I'm so embarrassed that I even had those thoughts, much less put it out there. Because I was that...' Schroeder said, looking visibly nervous.</p>

<p>Tamron interjected 'And so strongly,' before Stassi admitted: 'I was that Karen. I was a Karen. I was a Karen who basically said, but what about All Lives Matter?'</p>

<p>In March 2017, Stassi went on an offensive rant about black people and the #OscarsSoWhite controversy on her now-cancelled podcast Straight Up With Stassi.</p>

<p>The #OscarsSoWhite is a hashtag that was used to call out the lack of diversity at the ceremony and the star announced on her podcast she was 'really sick of everyone making everything about race,' and that she was 'kind of over it.'</p>

<p>Not impressed: Hall said she was 'shocked' at her 'level of ignorance as it relates to race,' specifically because she is from New Orleans and lives in Los Angeles, both of which are highly populated, diverse cities</p>

<p>In the past: Both Stassi and Kristen — who have starred on Pump Rules since 2013 — were fired from their roles on the popular Bravo program; seen with Jax Taylor, Katie Maloney, Tom Sandoval, Scheana Shay and Lisa Vanderpump</p>

<p>Friends: Stassi recently joined up with Brittany Cartwright and the Vanderpump Rules crew to celebrate Lala Kent and Randall Emmett's gender reveal for their unborn child</p>

<p>'But like, everyone giving their impassioned speeches about race and all that stuff, I'm like, "Why is it always just about African Americans?"'</p>

<p>Stassi went on to ask why Asians, Native American and Latinos weren't asking why they were not represented: 'Why is is always just "that?"'</p>

<p>Stassi said that she was 'not allowed to say that' as her opinion was marginalized as 'a white, privileged, blonde 28-year old.'</p>

<p>The star added: 'And then when they get upset, everybody has to go above and beyond to then make them happy,' clarifying that she hated saying the word '"them" because I'm not... not everybody's the same' but that she is referring to 'the ones that are out there b****ing about things.'</p>

<p>In the past: Clark and Schroeder had to put their Italian wedding plans on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic and announced they were expecting a baby girl in June; seen in 2019</p>
