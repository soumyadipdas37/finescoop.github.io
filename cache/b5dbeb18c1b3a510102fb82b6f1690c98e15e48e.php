<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>David Moyes remains hopeful of persuading Burnley defender James Tarkowski to join West Ham. </p>

<p>An offer worth up to £27million has been lodged and talks are ongoing. </p>

<p>Moyes wants to strengthen his defence rather than move for another forward such as Brentford's Said Benrahma. </p>

<p>David Moyes remains hopeful of persuading Burnley ace James Tarkowski to join West Ham</p>

<p>Burnley will still demand £50million for defender Tarkowski during the transfer window.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old was courted by Leicester last summer and is set to be in demand again after a solid season for the Clarets, who finished 10th in the Premier League after performing impressively post-lockdown.</p>

<p>Yet it is thought Burnley currently have no intention of negotiating the release clause in Tarkowski’s contract, given the difficulty of buying a replacement of the same level if he is sold.</p>

<p>The Burnley man has two England caps and was on the Three Lions' standby list for Russia 2018</p>
