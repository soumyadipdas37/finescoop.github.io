<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Herschel Walker has slammed Black Lives Matter as 'anti-government, anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-everything' and asked NFL owners and players 'is this who you are supporting' after learning one of the movement's founders once said she was a 'trained Marxist'.</p>

<p>The ex-NFL star, who is a longtime friend of Donald Trump and spoke in support of him at the Republican National Convention last month, posted a video on Twitter calling on BLM to 'tell the American people this is exactly who you stand for'.</p>

<p>Walker said he was 'blind but now I can see' after listening to one of the founders referring to themselves as Marxists in old footage. </p>

<p>BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors described herself and her fellow organizers as 'trained Marxists' who are trying to 'build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk' in a 2015 interview that resurfaced back in June.   </p>

<p>Walker's latest criticism of BLM comes after he faced a backlash over his RNC speech where he repeatedly insisted that Trump - his friend of 37 years - isn't a racist.</p>

<p>The sports star has also alienated his fellow athletes after saying 'there shouldn't be politics in sport' and making several jibes at players kneeling during the national anthem in protest at the cop killings of black people across America.</p>

<p>Herschel Walker has slammed Black Lives Matter as 'anti-government, anti-American, anti-Christian, anti-everything' and asked NFL owners and players 'is this who you are supporting' after learning one of the movement's founders once said she was a 'trained Marxist'</p>

<p>Walker took to social media Wednesday writing that he has 'finally WOKE UP' alongside a video of himself speaking to his followers.  </p>

<p>'First I want to apologize to the American people because I was blind but now I can see. I was deaf but now I can hear,' said Walker. </p>

<p>'The other day i was listening to one of the founders of Black Lives Matter and I heard her say that they are trained Marxists.'</p>

<p>He rambled: 'I've heard that statement so many times but then I finally heard it and I saw it with my own eyes.'</p>

<p>The former footballer challenged leaders of major league sports teams, churches and in politics to come forward and admit if they are supporting Marxist ideology in their support of BLM. </p>

<p>'I'm challenging every owner in NFL, every owner of major league sports and every owner of stadiums, every commissioner, every leader in Washington, every church. </p>

<p>'I'm challenging every professional player: Is this who you are supporting? A trained Marxist tells you they are anti-government, they're anti-American, they're anti-Christian, they're anti everything.'</p>

<p>He demanded that people who support the ideology 'need to come out and tell the American people this is exactly who you stand for'. </p>

<p>The ex-NFL star, who is a longtime friend of Donald Trump and spoke in support of him at the Republican National Convention last month, posted a video on Twitter calling on BLM to 'tell the American people this is exactly who you stand for'</p>

<p>'As I see all these signs, I see all these logos, commercials... I see all these stuff and that's okay as we're in America and you can support whoever you want and do what you want but you need to know and the American people need to know when you talk about supporting Black Lives Matter are you supporting the group that says they are trained Marxists because they they're making a lot of money and I like to know.'</p>

<p>Walker's rant appears to be referencing 2015 footage that surfaced in June of Cullors, 36, in an interview with The Real News Network. </p>

<p>'The first thing, I think, is that we actually do have an ideological frame. Myself and Alicia in particular are trained organizers,' she said, referring to her co-founder Alicia Garza.</p>

<p>'We are trained Marxists. We are super-versed on, sort of, ideological theories. </p>

<p>'And I think that what we really tried to do is build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk.' </p>

<p>The Black Lives Matter movement started with the use of the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of black teen Trayvon Martin in February 2012. </p>

<p>It grew following a Facebook post by Garza called 'A Love Letter to Black People' published shortly afterward. </p>

<p>It regained traction this year following the brutal police killing of black man George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 which sparked protests across America and further afield. </p>

<p>BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors described herself and her fellow organizers as 'trained Marxists' who are trying to 'build a movement that could be utilized by many, many black folk' in a 2015 interview that resurfaced back in June</p>

<p>Walker has hit out at support for the movement before and disregarded the symbol of protest made by many sports stars on the field.</p>

<p>National sports stars have taken a knee at games as a symbol of protest against systemic racism following a string of recent 'murders' of black men and women by cops across America.    </p>

<p>Trump has raged that kneeling during the anthem is a 'sign of great disrespect' and blasted that the game is 'over' for him when players do it. </p>

<p>Trump-supporter Walker has sided with Trump on the debate, saying 'there shouldn't be politics in sport'.</p>

<p>The former NFL running back for the Dallas Cowboys also defended Trump in his RNC speech saying that respecting the national anthem doesn't mean he doesn't care about social justice.  </p>

<p>'I've seen racism up close. I know what it is. And, it isn't Donald Trump,' Walker said at the RNC, who started out his pro career in the New Jersey Generals, a USFL team Trump owned.  </p>

<p>'I take it as a personal insult that people would think I've had a 37-year friendship with a racist. People who think that don't know what they're talking about.' </p>

<p>Walker's latest criticism of BLM comes after he faced a backlash over his RNC speech (above) where he repeatedly insisted that Trump - his friend of 37 years - isn't a racist </p>

<p>The New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals kneel while holding a black ribbon to honor Black Lives Matter before playing an opening day baseball game at Nationals Park in July. Walker has also alienated his fellow athletes after saying 'there shouldn't be politics in sport' and making several jibes at players kneeling during the national anthem</p>

<p>He added that 'just because someone loves and respects the flag, our national anthem, and our country doesn't mean they don't care about social justice. </p>

<p>'I care about all of those things, and so does Donald Trump. </p>

<p>'He shows how much he cares about social justice and the Black community through his actions. And his actions speak louder than any stickers or slogans on a jersey.' </p>

<p>Walker's speech sparked backlash online, prompting the racial slur 'Uncle Tom' to trend on Twitter, with thousands admonishing the NFL great for his endorsement. </p>

<p>Walker's son Christian Walker also waded in on the matter last month, calling Jacob Blake a ‘crazy, violent criminal’ after the unarmed black man was shot seven times in the back by police in Wisconsin. </p>

<p>Thousands have taken to the streets for Black Lives Matter protests demanding justice and calling for an end to police brutality and racism after a string of cop killings of black men and women across America in recent months. </p>

<p>Thousands have taken to the streets for BLM protests calling for an end to police brutality and racism after a string of cop killings of black people. Protests in LA on September 1 after Dijon Kizzee was shot and killed by two cops while he was out riding his bike in South Los Angeles</p>

<p>Protests in Kenosha on August 25 after Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a white cop in front of his three young children on August 23, leaving the father-of-six paralyzed from the waist down </p>

<p>Protests erupted in May following the 'murder' of George Floyd by a Minneapolis cop who knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes until he passed out and died. </p>

<p>Floyd's death reignited outrage over the death of Breonna Taylor, 26, who was shot eight times while sleeping in her bed when three plain clothes officers performed a no-knock arrest warrant at her Louisville apartment on March 13. </p>

<p>Then in June, unarmed father Rayshard Brooks was shot dead while he ran away from cops in the drive-thru of a Wendy's restaurant in Atlanta.   </p>

<p>Jacob Blake was shot seven times in the back by a white cop in front of his three young children on August 23, leaving the father-of-six paralyzed from the waist down. </p>

<p>One week later, 29-year-old Dijon Kizzee was shot and killed by two cops while he was out riding his bike in South Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Cops say Kizzee had dropped a pistol, bent down and picked it up when the officers shot him dead, while the attorney for his devastated family said cops shot him 20 times before leaving his dead handcuffed body in the street for hours.  </p>

<p>In early September, footage was released by the family of Daniel Prude, 41, showing cops in Rochester, New York, putting a spit hood over his face and pushing his face into the ground for two minutes until he passed out and died on March 23.  </p>

<p>The Monroe County medical examiner listed the manner of death as homicide caused by 'complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint' but no charges have been brought against any of the cops. </p>
