<p>Throwback: Line Of Duty star Martin marked a decade since he landed the role of DS Steve Arnott with a fun behind the scenes snap on Thursday</p>

<p>Iconic: The actor shared a snap alongside his co-stars (Vicky pictured as DC Kate Fleming and Adrian as Superintendent Ted Hastings) after the first series hit screens in 2012</p>

<p>Line Of Duty's first series aired on BBC Two in March 2012, although it's likely Martin would have landed the role many months earlier.</p>

<p>His snap proved the cast have barely changed despite years battling 'bent coppers' in the fictional AC-12. </p>

<p>Martin shared the snap after filming for series six resumed in early September in Belfast, with showrunner Jed Mercurio admitting he's still hopeful the show will return to screens in 2021.</p>

<p>In a recent photo from the set, Martin posed as his character DS Steve Arnott while sitting behind a glass wall, which appeared to be in a prison. </p>

<p>10 years! Line Of Duty's first series aired on BBC Two in March 2012, although it's likely Martin would have landed the role many months earlier</p>

<p>Talking about the highly-anticipated return to filming, creator Jed said: 'We know Line of Duty fans are desperate for Series 6 and we hope we can get it on air as soon as possible. Thanks so much for your patience in these difficult times.' </p>

<p>Series regulars, Martin, Vicky (DI Kate Fleming) and Adrian (Superintendent Ted Hastings), also issued statements about their return to filming.</p>
