<p>Footage released by China's Dalian Meteorology Bureau shows a waterspout looming over East Harbour Business District at 2pm on Friday. Another waterspout was spotted in the morning</p>

<p>A clip released by the authority on social media shows a giant column spinning over the Dalian Bay, which is part of the Yellow Sea.</p>

<p>Earlier today, another waterspout was spotted rotating in the city's Jinpu New District at around 11am, a post accompanying the video said.</p>

<p>Meteorologists said that the majority of the city had showers and thunderstorms today, which created 'favourable conditions' for waterspouts.</p>

<p>The rare natural phenomenon is known as 'dragon sucking water' in Mandarin.</p>

<p>Waterspouts typically occur when the air temperature in the sky suddenly drops to a much lower point than the air temperature near the water surface.</p>

<p>According to the National Ocean Service of the United States of America, waterspouts fall into two categories: the tornadic ones and the fair-weather ones.</p>

<p>Tornadic waterspouts are usually accompanied by high winds and seas, large hail, and frequent dangerous lightning. They develop downwards from thunderstorms.</p>

<p>On the other hand, fair-weather waterspouts form along the dark flat base of a line of developing cumulus clouds. They develop on the surface of waters and work their way upwards.</p>

<p>As fair-weather waterspouts form in light wind conditions, they usually move very little.</p>
