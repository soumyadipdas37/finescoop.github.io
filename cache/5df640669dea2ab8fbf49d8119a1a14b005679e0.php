<p>Candid: Joe Wicks has revealed that meditation helped him be 'proud' of his father after he previously saw his heroin addiction as a sign of 'weakness' </p>

<p>Talking to Headspace founder, Andy Puddicombe, on his Joe Wicks Podcast, he said: 'I did a meditation on letting of negativity and also one on gratitude. </p>

<p>'I had this amazing feeling. My dad was a really hard heroin addict when I was growing up and a lot of his friends died from overdoses.'</p>

<p>He added: 'When I did this meditation I had these lovely thoughts come to me of "Wow, I'm so proud of my dad and so grateful" because I always saw it as a weakness.</p>

<p>'I thought that as an addict you are a weak person. But he came through that and he survived.</p>

<p>Siblings: He was in and out of rehab throughout his childhood (pictured with older brother Nikki, now 36) </p>

<p>'I burst into tears basically and I rang him up and I had this wonderful conversation with him where I said, "Look I am really proud that you survived that and I am so grateful that you are alive". And I have never had that thought [before].'</p>

<p>And although he's had powerful moments, Joe also admitted that meditation can sometimes leave him feeling 'frustrated'.</p>

<p>He said: 'I have some meditations where I sit down and I am frustrated. I am not enjoying it. I don't get anything out of it and its kind of like a workout.</p>

<p>'Sometimes you really push and you feel great, other times you don't. I have had a couple of really powerful moments [meditating].' </p>

<p>Support: Joe shared that he has been receiving meditation, with some specific sessions looking at negativity and gratitude (pictured with mother Raquela) </p>

<p>Only recently, Joe revealed he promised himself that drug addiction would not be his 'destiny' after seeing his father Gary struggle from being a heroin addict.</p>

<p>The fitness guru shared he used exercise as a way to 'manage my feelings' as he and his older brother Nikki, 36, had to deal with their father's addiction.</p>

<p>Speaking on Russell Brand's Under The Skin podcast, Joe said: 'Because of my dad's addiction, and the damage I saw that cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. </p>

<p>'We weren't smoking weed, we were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn't going to be my destiny – that wasn't going to be my path.'</p>

<p>Joe admitted his father was in and out of rehab throughout his youth while he credited his mother Raquela with teaching him and his brother right from wrong. </p>

<p>The fitness expert, who is known as The Body Coach, now enjoys a great relationship with his father who he said still battles his addictions. </p>

<p>Joe revealed: 'Now, when my dad's going through a low period, I'm texting him and ringing him and asking how he is – I'm not judging him for being an addict. He'll always be an addict – he relapses all the time.'</p>

<p>The TV star said that now he has matured, he is there for his father and loves him 'just how he is'.  </p>

<p>Joe, who is father to daughter Indie, one, and son Marley, eight months, with his wife Rosie, also encourages his dad to exercise.</p>
