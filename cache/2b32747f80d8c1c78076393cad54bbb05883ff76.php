<p>In accordance with current safety guidelines he wore a safety mask while making his way across the sidewalk, but removed it before passing through the property's gates. </p>

<p>There he is: With a brightly coloured sweater worn above a pair of matching sweat pants, Justin was hard to miss while idling outside a friend's home with his model wife</p>

<p>The appearance comes after the couple celebrated their wedding anniversary with a picnic over the weekend. </p>

<p>Speaking about their marriage shortly after exchanging vows, Hailey discussed the trials and tribulations of their union.</p>

<p>She told Vogue: 'I'm not going to sit here and lie and say it's all a magical fantasy. It's always going to be hard. It's a choice. You don't feel it every single day. You don't wake up every day saying, "I'm absolutely so in love and you are perfect." </p>

<p>That's not what being married is. But there's something beautiful about it anyway.'   </p>

<p>Devoutly Christian Justin recently reflected on how fame changed him in a recent Instagram caption, telling fans how his journey from small town boy to superstar affected him.</p>

<p>'I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada,' he explained. 'I didn’t have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music. </p>

<p>'But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in.'</p>

<p>Low key: Joining her husband, Hailey opted for a comparatively subdued black top with a single rose embellishment embroidered across its back</p>

<p>'My values slowly started to change. Ego and power started to takeover and my relationships suffered because of it. I truly desire healthy relationships. </p>

<p>'I want to be motivated by truth and love. I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them!'</p>

<p>'I want to walk in the plans God has for me and not try and do it on my own! I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad! I’m grateful that I can walk with Jesus as he leads the way.'</p>
