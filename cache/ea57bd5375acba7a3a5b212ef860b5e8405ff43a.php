<p>The former TOWIE star also revealed that fans will get to see a different side to partner Paul on the new series and that he is usually 'camera shy'.</p>

<p>She continued: 'Five years later, he's starting to be a bit more comfortable on camera, you see a new side, really confident, nice for people to see the real Paul. He's a little bit camera shy, I suppose.'</p>

<p>Talking about how their relationship has coped in lockdown, Sam admitted that it has been really good and they have cherished the family time.</p>

<p>She said: 'I just think we cherished the time, life is such a whirlwind. We're always busy with the kids and working, it's nice to break for a minute with no commitments apart from the children.</p>

<p>Eek! To which she admitted: I hope so - two kids, five years, two big moves together. I hope so soon!'</p>

<p>Her love: Sam and Paul started dating in 2014 and they have two children - Paul Jr, four, and Rosie, two  </p>

<p>'Give them attention, let's use this time, it won't happen again. We actually really enjoyed it!'   </p>

<p>Sam recently moved away from her mother Suzie Wells and sister Billie to Surrey, talking about the new location she said: 'We love it here, we always wanted to be in Surrey, Hertfordshire was just a stepping stone.</p>

<p>'We took a leap and we are here. My mum and sister can see how happy we are, so they're happy for us.' </p>

<p>And it's a time of change for the family as Sam revealed that their son Paul Jr, four, is starting school this week. The couple famously had a row about sending him to nursery on The Mummy Diaries where they disagreed about the decision.</p>

<p>Memories! Talking about her plans for their future wedding, she added that she wants the youngsters as part of the day</p>

<p>Back to it! Sam and sister Billie also posed for some fun pictures in a red telephone box (L-R) </p>

<p>Talking about the milestone, Sam said: 'I am really excited, I think I'm going to cry my eyes out, but he's going to really love it.'  </p>

<p>Teasing the upcoming series, she added: 'Don't worry, we haven't hidden anything. There's still tantrums, tears and drama. It was filmed during lockdown and our move to Surrey!'</p>

<p>Talk also turned turned to the TOWIE 10-year anniversary, which will be celebrated in September with special reunion episodes.  </p>

<p>Speaking of her time on the ITVBe show, Sam said: 'I was 19 when I started the show, 29 now, to think ten years ago, is insane. </p>

<p>Growing up: Sam revealed that their son Paul Jr, four, is starting school this week. The couple famously had a row about sending him to nursery on The Mummy Diaries where they disagreed about the decision (Paul pictured walking cousin Nelly to school)  </p>

<p>'Ten year anniversary, I am going to be getting involved, not on the show but looking back at the best bits.</p>

<p>'It was a huge part of my life, what was funny about it, we had nothing to lose - 19, no children, just fun. When I look back we actually had fun.' </p>

<p>In the past, the star revealed that she and partner Paul are constantly pressurised by fans to get married, but they don't let the comments bother them. </p>

<p>Emotional: Talking about the milestone, Sam said: 'I am really excited, I think I'm going to cry my eyes out, but he's going to really love it.'</p>

<p>Sam told MailOnline: 'I actually don't [feel pressurised]. I know everyone asks all the time, especially since Billie and Greg got married - it's been more heightened. It's really not top of my priorities. </p>

<p>'I always say to Paul, he's not anyway, but I always say: "Don't every feel pressure" and he's like "No, I don't." </p>

<p>'I do look forward to when it does happen as it will be a whole new chapter for our lives. I don't mind that it's not happening right now as I'm really busy and I've got it to look forward to. </p>

<p>Claim to fame: Talk also turned turned to the TOWIE 10-year anniversary, which will be celebrated in September with special reunion episodes (Sam pictured with sister Billie in 2011)</p>

<p>'We've just done Billie and Greg's wedding, a big build up, so that was epic then I think we've got it all again to come. I think I'm alright holding off for a bit, it's exciting times ahead.'</p>

<p>And when asked whether she would ever document her wedding on the series, Sam admitted: 'I haven't even thought about it, personally for me, it’s part of my life, I’ve done it forever.</p>

<p>'I don’t know, it’s just Paul… whether it’s a decision Paul and I would have to make together.' </p>

<p>Lorraine continues on weekdays at 9am on ITV. </p>

<p>She's back! Sam said: 'Ten year anniversary, I am going to be getting involved, not on the show but looking back at the best bits.' </p>
