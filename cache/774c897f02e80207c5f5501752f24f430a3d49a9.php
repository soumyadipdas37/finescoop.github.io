<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>'It's wonderful to get lost in this spell' - these are the words in the song 'Sentimento Nuevo' by Franco Battiato which epitomises the great love affair between Juventus and Alvaro Morata. </p>

<p>The striker arrived at Turin's Caselle airport on the night of 21 September and was moved by the reception he received - a confirmation of the footballer's great desire to return to Italy to play for Juventus. </p>

<p>The player and club have a unique bond that goes beyond a simple working relationship, one that has influenced the Spaniard's entire footballing career. </p>

<p>Alvaro Morata has rejoined Juventus on a season-long loan from LaLiga side Atletico Madrid</p>

<p>The Spaniard has a close connection with the Turin club having first played for them in 2014</p>

<p>The striker was strongly wanted by Antonio Conte before his first Turin spell in 2014 - at the time Morata was 22 and had little chance of playing for Real Madrid. </p>

<p>With the help of Conte's suggestion, Juventus bought him and remained in Turin for two years. In that period Turin was his home, where he was pampered like a son who soon preferred the Italian city to Madrid. </p>

<p>Conte launched him in Serie A, Masimilliano Allegri matured him temperamentally but now current Juventus head coach Andrea Pirlo will turn him into a killer in the penalty area. </p>

<p>THE ROLE OF ALICE CAMPELLO IN MORATA'S JUVENTUS RETURN  </p>

<p>Morata is married to the Venetian influencer Alice Campello whom he met in Turin. The pair first contacted each other on Instagram, where the footballer sent her a private message.</p>

<p>Speaking to the weekly magazine Who, the fashion influencer described the first steps of their love story.</p>

<p>Campello said: 'I didn't know who he was so I asked my parents. My father told me to stay away from the players. At the beginning I didn't really listen to the message. </p>

<p>Morata (above) helped Juventus reach the Champions League final in 2015 against Barcelona</p>

<p>A major reason why Morata is returning to Juventus is his wife Alice Campello</p>

<p>'But inside I felt that there was something that forced me to respond (to Morata). One morning I did it and after a week we met at Milan.</p>

<p>Morata has built a large family with her - they now have two twins and a third child is on the way. Italy has always been Morata's emotional place, only in Turin and with Juventus has he truly felt loved as a player and as a man. </p>

<p>Campello has always supported her husband's choices, following him to London for the striker's spell at Chelsea and to Madrid for his journeys at Atletico Madrid and at Real Madrid. Though the striker failed to replicate the same feelings and emotions in England and Spain compared to his life in Turin.</p>

<p>His time at Chelsea started brightly, scoring a hat-trick away at Stoke and netting the winner against Manchester United in his first few months as a Blues player.</p>

<p>Campello is a big football fan and has followed Morata (right) everywhere he goes</p>

<p>But the feeling that Morata was going to step into Diego Costa's shoes at Stamford Bridge slowly ebbed away. A mixture of injuries, lack of form and Antonio Conte struggling in his final season at west London meant Morata was often used as a scapegoat by Chelsea supporters.</p>

<p>Speaking about his time at Chelsea last summer, Morata told Goal: 'I didn't quite feel loved or appreciated by the club or the fans. I started very well at Chelsea, but an injury in the end leaves you a bit stuck.'</p>

<p>The move to Atletico Madrid was meant to be the striker's fresh new start, but he never felt quite at home there. A burglary in his Madrid home with his wife and children inside while Morata was on international duty was a chilling moment for the Spaniard in only his first season at the Wanda Metropolitano.</p>

<p>However the pair have a close connection with Italy and even got married in Venice (above)</p>

<p>Morata always wanted to return to Turin since the day he left Juventus and Campello's love for Turin influenced the striker to arrange a reunion. Morata's children speak both Italian and Spanish and were even been enrolled in an Italian kindergarten in Madrid. </p>

<p>Soon the family will expand and Alice and Alvaro's third child will be born in Turin, just like his parents have always dreamed of. The child's name, Leonardo, has already been decided and the return to Italy will influence the love of both the couple. </p>

<p>Morata's wife was born in Mestre and loves both fashion and football. After graduating from IULM University, she became a fashion blogger and creates an industrial line of bags that is highly appreciated by young people.</p>

<p>PIRLO LOVES MORATA AS A MAN AND AS A FOOTBALLER</p>

<p>As unveiled by Sportsmail last month, Morata has always been Pirlo's first choice striker target since the day he arrived in the Juventus dugout but Atletico Madrid's asking price had slowed down the negotiations. </p>

<p>The Spanish striker is a special person but above all a man of great moral values: a quality considered essential by the Italian club to seek a peaceful harmony among the many stars and ego in the dressing room.   </p>

<p>In the 2 years in which he played with Morata, Pirlo was able to appreciate his generosity on the pitch as well as his footballing elegance. </p>

<p>Juventus head coach Andrea Pirlo (above) made Morata his number one transfer target</p>

<p>The Italian coach chose Morata because he wants to have a fast player in a 3-5-2 formation who is physically strong and capable of running from one box to another in the direction of the opponent's penalty area. </p>

<p>Compared closely to Roma's Edin Dzeko, Morata has a worse goal-per-game average than the Bosnian but has a closer relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo, who played with Morata at Real Madrid. </p>

<p>Pirlo chose the Spaniard because he considers him the most suitable to play with both Paulo Dybala and Ronaldo. Morata has excellent relations with both players and with them he is not able to build a perfect forward line. </p>

<p>The pair know each other from their time as Juventus team-mates - Morata's first spell in Turin</p>

<p>Morata also works hard to help his team-mates in midfield and is very skilled with his powerful physique in the penalty area. </p>

<p>Morata played 49 matches for Atletico Madrid but scored just 18 goals - too few for an out-and-out striker. The Spaniard will have to work hard to improve this poor record. </p>

<p>AN INITAL ONE-SEASON LOAN FOR MORATA  </p>

<p>Morata was signed for a second time by Juventus by driving through a very sophisticated transfer puzzle. </p>

<p>Juventus will pay Atletico Madrid around £9million over the course of the season during his loan spell. The Serie A champions will then will be able to buy the player permanently for £32.5million. </p>

<p>According to Italian news outlet Tuttosport, Morata will cost Juventus just under £7milllion-a-year in salary. </p>

<p>At the end of the loan, Juventus are not obliged to make the deal permanent, but if they do end up paying the £32.5million permanent fee then the club will have made no losses and there would be no after-effect on the club's financial account. </p>

<p>Continuing the comparisons with Dzeko, Juventus have acquired a 28-year-old footballer much younger than the Bosnian striker. The Serie A giants will also be able to benefit from saving a lot of money.</p>

<p>RONALDO AND MORATA TOGETHER AGAIN</p>

<p>Stephen King's famous book 'Sometimes they come back' seems to have inspired the reunion between Cristiano Ronaldo and Alvaro Morata. The pair spent many years together in Real Madrid and fired the LaLiga side to many victories in Spain. </p>

<p>Both Ronaldo and Morata differ in age, 33 and 27 respectively. Together, they played 62 games together for Real Madrid, achieving 45 wins, 11 draws and just six defeats when they played up front. </p>

<p>They both ended up on the scoresheet ten times in the same match and every time they did Real Madrid won the game by scoring four goals. </p>

<p>Morata (top) will also be reunited with ex-Real Madrid team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo (bottom) </p>

<p>In 2017, Ronaldo and Morata played together for the final time against Juventus in the Champions League final in Cardiff. Now they will try to reach the same stage with Juventus starting with a Serie A against Roma on Sunday. </p>

<p>With Morata at Pirlo's disposal, Juventus will be able to use the 3-5-2, 4-3-3 and 3-4-1-2 set-ups. The Spaniard is in fact one of the few European strikers able to adapt to any position in attack. </p>

<p>In Andrea Pirlo's new Juventus he will be the number 9, the battering ram to be effective in the heart of the penalty area.</p>
