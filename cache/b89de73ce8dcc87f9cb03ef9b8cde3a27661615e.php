<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Rennes president Nicolas Holveck has confirmed Edouard Mendy wants to leave the club and join Chelsea this summer and has reportedly agreed a deal with the Premier League side.</p>

<p>The Blues have been strongly linked with the Frenchman in the wake of Kepa Arrizabalaga's woeful campaign, which saw the world's most expensive goalkeeper lose his spot in Frank Lampard's starting XI.</p>

<p>RMC Sport have claimed that 28-year-old goalkeeper has already agreed to a 'five-year deal' with Chelsea but the two clubs remain apart of their valuation of the player.</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy has told Rennes he wants to join Chelsea, says club president Nicolas Holveck</p>

<p>Chelsea have already had a £14million bid rejected by the Ligue 1 outfit and are reportedly wanting £23m for their No 1. </p>

<p>However, it appears it will only be a matter of time before a move is sanction following Holveck's omission in a press conference on Wednesday.</p>

<p>When asked about Mendy's ongoing situation, Holveck said: 'We've started official negotiations with Chelsea to sell Edouard Mendy.</p>

<p>'We know the player wants to leave [and join Chelsea]. But the agreement at the moment is not 100 per cent completed between the three parts.' </p>

<p>Rennes president Holveck confirmed the two clubs are negotiating a transfer for Mendy</p>

<p>Should Mendy complete his move to Stamford Bridge, Arrizabalaga's future will be called into question following his sub-par performances towards the end of last season. </p>

<p>The Spaniard was dropped for the final three games of last season after some inconsistent performances.</p>

<p>Willy Caballero was preferred for the final Premier League game of the season against Wolves, the FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal and the Champions League last-16 second-leg loss to Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>A £71million signing from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, Kepa has endured a tough two seasons in English football, with his first overshadowed by an on-pitch row with then-manager Maurizio Sarri during the 2019 Carabao Cup final at Wembley. </p>

<p>Despite the move for Mendy, Chelsea's technical director Petr Cech insists no one at the club is 'giving up' on the current No 1. </p>

<p>A move for Mendy will call into question the future of Chelsea's current No 1 Kepa Arrizabalaga </p>

<p>Frank Lampard has already spent more than £200m on a host of signings during this window</p>

<p>Cech told reporters in his native Czech Republic last week: 'Additions will be made to the squad, perhaps even in goal, and this is what is being discussed now.</p>

<p>'But nobody is giving up on Kepa and we all hope he has a great future.'</p>

<p>Chelsea have also reportedly pondered moves for Atletico Madrid shot-stopper Jan Oblak and Burnley's Nick Pope.</p>
