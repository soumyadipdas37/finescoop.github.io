<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>French police have made their first arrest after a wave of mysterious attacks on horses which has left dozens of animals savagely mutilated or killed. </p>

<p>A 50-year-old man who is known for attacking animals across the border in Germany was arrested after police circulated a computer-generated image based on the testimony of an horse owner who chased after him. </p>

<p>The man is one of two people suspected of attacking horses in the Yonne department of central France, regional prosecutor Arnaud Laraize said.</p>

<p>More than 20 horses have had their ears cut off in France and several have died in a series of grisly attacks which have so far defied explanation. </p>

<p>While it is clear that multiple attackers are operating around the country, it is not known whether they are carrying out cult-like rituals, copycat attacks or morbid 'challenges' on social media. </p>

<p>French police released this e-fit of a man suspected of slashing ponies in Burgundy in late August, and a 50-year-old man has now been arrested</p>

<p>The suspect was being questioned regarding a late August attack in Burgundy, after the head of an animal refuge chased after two men slashing his ponies. </p>

<p>Stable manager Nicolas Demajean's arm was slashed as he wrangled with one of the attackers and police produced a drawing based on his description. </p>

<p>Prosecutors said the suspect was known in neighbouring Germany for attacks on animals, and was registered in France for drug-related crimes. </p>

<p>Searches of his home did not find conclusive evidence but there was considerable digital material still to examine, prosecutors said. </p>

<p>Laraize said it was not clear if there was any link to the other attacks.</p>

<p>'In this case, we absolutely do not exclude the idea that there is no link with other incidents nationwide,' the prosecutor said.</p>

<p>French police at the weekend launched a search for two suspects in the Cote-d'Or region of eastern France after a stable owner found a horse wounded.</p>

<p>A 40-strong team of gendarmes backed up by police dogs and a helicopter were sent to the scene but have not found the culprits so far.</p>

<p>The Val-d'Oise department close to Paris recorded its first cases on Saturday, where one mare had a cut in the vulva and another was wounded in the side. </p>

<p>Separately, Emmanuel Macron's interior minister on Monday announced the start of night patrols by French gendarmes to reassure worried horse owners. </p>

<p>Gerald Darmanin said police have opened 153 investigations on the horse attacks, with 30 of them involving deaths or 'extremely violent injuries'. </p>

<p>French agriculture minister Julien Denormandie speaks with horse breeder Mireille Didier as he meets with stable owners whose animals have been attacked in Plailly yesterday </p>

<p>The minister warned horse owners against taking justice into their own hands by trying to take down the attackers.  </p>

<p>'The drama within the drama would be an owner ... wanting to take vengeance, do justice, take out his rifle, fight with someone who goes after his horses,' he said.</p>

<p>The minister spoke after visiting the owner of a horse who was a victim of the mysterious attacks in the Oise region, north of Paris. </p>

<p>'No one line is being favored,' Darmanin said of the investigations.  </p>

<p>Knives have been used to slash the horses and, in some cases, mutilate them, with organs sometimes removed. </p>

<p>A horse's face was disfigured in one case and blood was drained in another, while a right ear has often been cut off like a trophy. </p>
