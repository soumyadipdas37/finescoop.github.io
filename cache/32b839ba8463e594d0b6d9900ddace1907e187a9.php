<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A gardener has been photographed mowing the lawn outside a Labor MP's office in Melbourne - despite Premier Daniel Andrews forbidding similar work across the state due to COVID-19 restrictions.</p>

<p>The photo was snapped outside Labor MP Chris Brayne's office in McCrae, south-east of Melbourne, on Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Under current state restrictions, only council gardeners are permitted to work during the pandemic - sole trader gardeners are not allowed to operate.</p>

<p>The person who hired the gardener is unknown after both the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council and Victorian government refuted their involvement. </p>

<p>A government spokesperson confirmed Mr Brayne did not contract the gardener last weekend.</p>

<p>'Neither the Member for Nepean nor the Department of Parliamentary Services is responsible for maintenance outside the electorate office, and neither has contracted any work,' the spokesperson said.    </p>

<p>Edward O'Donohue, the Liberal MP for the Eastern Victoria Region, believes the episode highlights the confusion surrounding measures imposed by the premier.</p>

<p>'The fact that it is even controversial for an independent lawnmower to be cutting the grass in front of a Labor MP's office just further demonstrates the confusion and inconsistency about the Andrews Government's punitive lockdown measures,' he told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Jim Penman, the founder of Jim's Mowing, went a step further, stating the photo is an obvious example of 'political hypocrisy.'</p>

<p>'Council workers are doing the same job, and in groups, yet individual franchisees are being prevented from earning a living,' he said.</p>

<p>Jim's Mowing founder Jim Penman (pictured) has accused the Andrews Government of 'political hypocrisy'</p>

<p>'This just highlights politics over health and that these things don't matter when it comes to privilege.</p>

<p>'It's outrageous that sole gardeners who have no contact with anyone when doing their jobs are being prevented from working.'</p>

<p>Under Melbourne's controversial lockdown rules, residents caught breaking the chief health officer's guidelines can be slugged with a $1652 fine.</p>

<p>In addition, people leaving their homes for work under Stage Four lockdown restrictions are required to show a permit if they are pulled over by police. </p>
