<p>But she was so adamant that it was her lucky charm, Wharfe claims she had it flown over from London in a diplomatic bag to the British Embassy in the South Asian country. </p>

<p>He wrote that she attached 'almost superstitious importance' to the object and that Diana told him: 'You know everything will go wrong without it.' </p>

<p>Emma will portray Diana during the early part of her relationship with the Prince of Wales, before handing over the role to Elizabeth Debicki, for series five and six of the hit Netflix drama.</p>

<p>She told British Vogue: 'I feel I've got to know Diana like you would a friend. I know that sounds really weird, but I get a great sense of companionship from her.</p>

<p>'I suppose, over time, you kind of start to patch together a sense of empathy and a sense of understanding. I love figuring people out.'    </p>

<p>Diana married Prince Charles in 1981, and the couple welcomed sons William in 1982 and Harry in 1984. After separating in 1991, the couple divorced in 1997.</p>

<p>Emma's casting was announced in April 2019, with The Crown's creator Peter Morgan calling her 'a brilliant talent who immediately captivated us when she came in for the part of Diana Spencer.'</p>

<p>He said: 'As well as having the innocence and beauty of a young Diana, she also has, in abundance, the range and complexity to portray an extraordinary woman who went from anonymous teenager to becoming the most iconic woman of her generation.'   </p>
