<p>Phil Foden has revealed it was a 'dream come true' to make his England debut on Saturday</p>

<p>Foden told Sky Sports: 'It feels amazing, it's a dream come true. Just to make me debut today is a big moment for me and my family. </p>

<p>'It was a very difficult game. They defended well, we showed great character to stay in the game. </p>

<p>'To get the win is massive for the country. I didn't feel the pressure, we all just try to play our football. </p>

<p>'Like I said before we showed great character and came through for the win. It's a very high standard in training. </p>

<p>The Manchester City youngster played his part in the Three Lions' 1-0 victory over Iceland</p>

<p>'I just try to learn as much as I can. I want to keep playing for my country, not just a one-off. </p>

<p>'Hopefully I can keep the shirt. We are going to go into the next game to make it two out of two and hopefully we can get the job done.' </p>

<p>Raheem Sterling’s last-gasp spot-kick saved England’s blushes in Iceland as a tepid Nations League encounter came to a dramatic conclusion.</p>

<p>With March’s friendlies scrapped and Euro 2020 postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Three Lions returned with a whimper in front of empty stands in Reykjavik after their enforced 10-month break.</p>

<p>Harry Kane’s disallowed opener and Kyle Walker’s sending off looked to have been the key moments in Iceland, only for England to snatch a late 1-0 win as Birkir Bjarnason blazed over a penalty moments after Sterling slotted one home. </p>
