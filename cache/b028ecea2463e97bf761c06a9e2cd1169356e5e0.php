<p>The 20-year-old signed for the Toffees last summer in a Â£25million deal but struggled to make an impact.</p>

<p>Italy international Kean started just six Premier League matches and scored only two goals.</p>

<p>Juventus 'want to bring Moise Kean back from Everton' after the striker struggled in England</p>

<p>Kean scored a penalty in Everton's 3-0 Carabao Cup win over Salford City in midweek</p>

<p>He was on target from the penalty spot, however, as Everton beat League Two side Salford City in the Carabao Cup last week.</p>

<p>The low point was reached when interim manager Duncan Ferguson substituted him just 19 minutes after bringing him on against Manchester United at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>However, according to goal.com, former club Juventus want to offer Kean an escape route and get his career back on track.</p>

<p>They report that the Italian champions wish to sign Kean on loan without an obligation to buy.</p>

<p>Everton though would like to include such an obligation in any deal or sell the striker outright.</p>

<p>Kean's first season in the Premier League was a disappointment as he started just six games</p>

<p>The Italy international signed just over a year ago but could be on his way back to Italy</p>

<p>It was at Juventus that Kean developed into one of the most exciting young players in European football.</p>

<p>He broke through during the second half of the 2018-19 season, scoring six Serie A goals in six matches.</p>

<p>That made Everton's purchase of him last summer look like a genuine coup but the striker has struggled on Merseyside.</p>

<p>Back in November, Kean's father admitted the Everton move was a 'mistake' and blamed the player's agent Mino Raiola and his own ex-wife.</p>
