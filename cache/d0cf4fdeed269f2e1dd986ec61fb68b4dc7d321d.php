<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mikel Arteta is sweating over the fitness of key defender David Luiz after the Brazilian sustained a neck injury.</p>

<p>According to The Athletic, Luiz's issue requires particular caution and he could face an extended period out on the sidelines.</p>

<p>As a result, Rob Holding is expected to remain at Arsenal rather than join Newcastle on a loan deal. </p>

<p>David Luiz has sustained a neck injury and is a doubt for Arsenal's season opener at Fulham</p>

<p>Luiz is expected to miss Arsenal's Premier League opener against Fulham on Saturday in the early kick-off at Craven Cottage. </p>

<p>If the Brazilian Luiz, 33, is set for a prolonged absence it would be a major blow for Gunners boss Arteta ahead of his first full season at the Emirates.</p>

<p>Shkodran Mustafi, Calum Chambers and Pablo Mari are all returning to fitness after their own injury issues while new arrivals William Saliba and Gabriel are untested in the Premier League.</p>

<p>Sokratis Papastathopoulos has been unfancied by Arteta ever since he arrived as manager but the Spaniard might be forced to turn to him in the coming weeks.</p>
