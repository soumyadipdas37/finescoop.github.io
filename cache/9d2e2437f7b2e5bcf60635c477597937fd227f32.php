<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>TOWIE's Georgia Kousoulou has hit out at former stars of the show who declined offers to return for the 10th anniversary episodes. </p>

<p>Over the past month, the ITVBe hit has marked a decade on air with a retrospective show which looked back on the best moments over the years, however original stars, including Mark Wright and Lucy Mecklenburgh, declined to appear. </p>

<p>The former lovebirds, aged 33 and 29 respectively, insisted they have moved on with their lives, yet Georgia, 29, claimed their snub was disrespectful.</p>

<p>Hitting back: TOWIE's Georgia Kousoulou has hit out at former stars of the show who declined offers to return for the 10th anniversary episodes</p>

<p>Both Mark and Lucy were original stars of the show, with the starlet entering as Mark's love interest, much to the chagrin of his on-off love Lauren Goodger. </p>

<p>Mark stayed on the show for three seasons, before departing in 2011, while Lucy left in 2013 after appearing in 10 series of the reality hit. </p>

<p>After leaving the show and enjoying roaring success in other ventures, the duo hit headlines earlier this month when it was revealed they would not return for the show, which saw stars past and present look back on a decade of the show. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, Georgia said: 'I think it is bad that some of the original cast decided not to do the anniversary special...</p>

<p>Not good: Over the past month, the ITVBe hit has marked a decade on air with a retrospective show which looked back on the best moments over the years, however original stars, including Mark Wright and Lucy Mecklenburgh, declined to appear (Lucy and Mark in 2010)</p>

<p>'I think everyone should have done it. TOWIE made you, so I think everyone should have done it to show respect to the show that made you. </p>

<p>'Even if you don't want to film new episodes for the 10th anniversary series, the least you can do is the reunion show. Towie has given you the life you have now.</p>

<p>'I don't think you should ever forget'.</p>

<p>Shocker: Mark's ex-fiancée Lauren Goodger did not make an appearance on the show </p>

<p>Last month, it was revealed that due to her family and work commitments, Lucy feels she doesn't have the time to pop back on the ITVBe show.</p>

<p>An insider said: 'Lucy loves the show and has a real soft spot for it but unfortunately she’s too busy to fit in filming for the reunion...</p>

<p>'She has so much going on at the moment. 'She tried to make it work but when everything was taken into account, something had to give. It’s sad but not really surprising.'</p>

<p>Around the same time as Lucy's news, it was revealed that Mark had no intentions of returning as he is 'at a different place in his life'.  </p>

<p>Out and about: Show original Amy Childs made a comeback as did Joey Essex and the Faiers sisters </p>
