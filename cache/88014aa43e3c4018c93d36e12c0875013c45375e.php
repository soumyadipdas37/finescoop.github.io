<p>Collaborators: Maya Hawke was seen heading to dinner with Jesse Harris on Thursday evening in New York City. The 22-year-old Stranger Things actress and the 50-year-old music producer have worked together on her new album Blush</p>

<p>Maya looked fashionable in a beautiful black and gold brocade button-up jacket with a short collar and long sleeves that looked very warm.</p>

<p>She added loose-fitting denim boyfriend jeans that were rolled up on the bottom as well as white sneakers with a generous sole. </p>

<p>There was a long strapped purse on her shoulder and she had a face mask pulled down revealing she was makeup free as she pulled her brunette hair up, away from her face. </p>

<p>Harris, who co-wrote and produced the album Blush, was in a red-and-white shirt with khaki slacks and beige sneakers and a black mask pulled down to his chin.</p>

<p>He is best known for the albums Songs Never Sung, Sub Rosa and Aquarelle. </p>

<p>Gattaca star Ethan was seen seated at the table with a scruffy beard and a cap on as a bandanna lay on his chest. </p>

<p>With dad for dinner: Gattaca star Ethan was seen seated at the table with a scruffy beard and a cap on as a bandanna lay on his chest</p>

<p>He was wed to Uma from 1998 until 2005. Together they have not only Maya but also 18-year-old son Levon Roan.</p>

<p>She released her first album Blush in August</p>

<p>In 2008 he wed Ryan Shawhughes  with whom her has children Indiana, aged nine, and 12-year-old Clementine.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Maya revealed she had dyslexia in an interview with NPR. </p>

<p>'I would say it is, like, one of the great blessings of my life in a lot of ways,' said she when asked if she 'suffers' from dyslexia. </p>

<p>The star admitted she did get 'kicked out of school for not being able to read when I was a kid.'</p>

<p>She added: 'I went to a special school for kids with learning disabilities. And it took me a long time to learn how to read, and I still am limited.</p>

<p>'But the wonderful thing about today's world is that there are so many options. There's something about having had a limitation in regards to my ability to produce and take in stories that made me even more determined to love them and understand them and grow in them,' she added.</p>

<p>His ladies: He was wed to Uma, left, from 1998 until 2005. Together they have not only Maya but also 18-year-old son Levon Roan (seen in 2001). In 2008 he wed Ryan Shawhughes, right, with whom her has children Indiana, aged nine, and 12-year-old Clementine (seen in 2018)</p>

<p>The actress and singer also said that, 'it was deeply difficult, you know, to be in the slow class.'</p>

<p>Maya added: 'Every grade that went by, you get dropped down into a lower and lower reading group.'</p>

<p>Hawke also said that other kids would find out about being in the lower classes and there was bullying, 'but my parents did a wonderful job of encouraging me to be creative.'</p>

<p>She added that her father Ethan directed the music video for her song Coverage, which was made at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>'COVID had just really hit. So I made - I did these live videos with my family,' she began.</p>

<p>She shines just like mom does: The star looked like Uma in this gold dress at the Mainstream premiere at the 77th Venice Film Festival in Italy last week</p>

<p>No there: There was no sign of the budding star's rumoured love interest, British actor Tom Sturridge, whom she was seen with earlier this summer. Here he is seen with ex-fiancee Sienna Miller in December 2013</p>

<p>'But people call it a music video, I think, because, like, my dad is such a special filmmaker that even with, like, an iPhone and 10 minutes to prepare and me being, like, everyone we're going to play the song in the barn; like, Dad, will you make a video? - his brain turns on and he goes, OK,' Hawke added of her father.</p>

<p>She added that the title of her album Blush came from a lyric in the song Coverage, which she added is the only song on the album about acting.</p>

<p>'But where the title really comes from for me is about this idea of embarrassment. Most people wouldn't describe me as a particularly shameful or shy person. But I actually walk through my life feeling tremendously embarrassed most of the time - that I talked too loud at a party or said something stupid or, you know, whatever it is,' she shared.</p>

<p>'So that's part of what it means. And the other part of what it means is that blush is simultaneously a revealing thing. Like, when you blush, you're revealing something about yourself, something personal. And it's also a mask, like if you put on blush or makeup. It's a mask. It hides your face, your feelings,' Hawke continued.</p>

<p>Deeply difficult: The actress and singer also said that, 'it was deeply difficult, you know, to be in the slow class'; seen in Stranger Things with Joe Keery as Steve Harrington</p>
