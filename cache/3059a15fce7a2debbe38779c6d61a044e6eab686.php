<p>The £71.6million goalkeeper appeared to be heading for the exit this summer after he was left out of the squad for the FA Cup final and a Champions League clash at Bayern Munich. </p>

<p>Chelsea have been linked with several goalkeepers over the summer including Edouard Mendy, Nick Pope, Dean Henderson and Jan Oblak.</p>

<p>Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga has made a surprising U-turn on his future</p>

<p>But Frank Lampard has instead splashed out £136million on Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech and Thiago Silva.</p>

<p>Kepa is now convinced his best option is to stay put rather than seek a move from Stamford Bridge, according to the Sun.</p>

<p>The 25-year-old still has four years left on a £150,000-a-week contract and Chelsea would want to recoup at least £50m of their transfer fee back. This has put off clubs offering him a way out.</p>

<p>Kepa played 45 minutes of Saturday’s 1-1 friendly draw at Brighton.</p>
