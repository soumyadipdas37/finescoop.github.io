<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Google Maps has removed virtual walking tours of Uluru almost a year after visitors were banned from climbing the iconic landmark.</p>

<p>Parks Australia asked Google to remove pictures of climbers scaling the culturally significant summit 'in accordance with the wishes of Anangu, Uluru's traditional owners, and the national park's Film and Photography Guidelines'. </p>

<p>A spokesperson for Parks Australia told the ABC they alerted Google 'the user-generated images from the Uluru summit that have been posted on their mapping platform'.  </p>

<p>Google Maps has removed virtual walking tours of Uluru at the request of Parks Australia</p>

<p>The Uluru climb was permanently closed on October 26, 2019. Pictured: Two people are seen scaling the landmark</p>

<p>The Uluru climb was permanently closed on October 26, 2019, following a landmark decision made by the traditional owners of the land. </p>

<p>Google's street view allows users to click through roads and environments across the world as if travelling on foot.</p>

<p>The function once included 360-degree images from the top of Uluru, allowing online visitors to climb the landmark and enjoy the view from the top.  </p>

<p>But Google has now removed pictures depicting the climb, following the request from Parks Australia - and in-line with the ban.</p>

<p>'We understand Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park is deeply sacred to the Anangu people,' a spokeswoman told 9news.com.au.</p>

<p>'As soon as Parks Australia raised their concerns about this user contribution, we removed the imagery.' </p>

<p>Google Australia said it could take 24 hours for the changes to come into effect. </p>

<p>Thousands of Australians rushed to the Northern Territory this time last year to climb the landmark ahead of its closure. </p>

<p>It was announced in November 2017 that climbing Uluru, considered a sacred site by the local Anangu people, would be banned from October 26, 2019.</p>

<p>Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park's board of management, made up of a majority of Aboriginal traditional owners, unanimously decided to close the climb.</p>

<p>Traditional owner and board chairman Sammy Wilson said on behalf of the Anangu people it was time to do so.</p>

<p>'We've talked about it for so long and now we're able to close the climb,' Mr Wilson said. 'It's about protection through combining two systems, the government and Anangu.</p>

<p>'This decision is for both Anangu and non-Anangu together to feel proud about; to realise, of course it's the right thing to close it.</p>

<p>'The land has law and culture. We welcome tourists here. Closing the climb is not something to feel upset about but a cause for celebration. Let's come together, let's close it together.</p>

<p>'If I travel to another country and there is a sacred site, an area of restricted access, I don't enter or climb it, I respect it. It is the same here for Anangu. We welcome tourists here. We are not stopping tourism, just this activity.'</p>

<p>On 26 October 1985 Uluru and Kata Tjuta - formerly known as the Olgas - were handed back to the Anangu people.</p>
