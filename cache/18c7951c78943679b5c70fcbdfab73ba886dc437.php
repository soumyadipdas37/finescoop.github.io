<p>She's still standing: Jenni Falconer was seen heading to Global Studios to present her Smooth Radio show in central London on Tuesday, after injuring her left foot</p>

<p>Highlighting her enviable legs, the TV and radio star's ensemble allowed her to soak up the sun.</p>

<p>The media personality opted for comfort when it came to her footwear choice as she wore a white trainer on her right foot, while her injured foot was protected in the mobility aid.</p>

<p>Animal print shades and a dainty necklace rounded of Jenni's outfit, while her straight tresses framed her face perfectly. </p>

<p>Commanding attention: The Scottish host, 44, looked typically stylish in a navy skater dress, which she teamed with her fracture walker boot</p>

<p>On Monday, the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon.</p>

<p>She said: 'A few weeks ago I sustained a stress fracture on my 3rd metatarsal. Frustratingly it’s very hard to spot on an X-ray and so it took quite a while to diagnose.</p>

<p>'Anyway, it happened six weeks ago and thankfully it is repairing well so I have to wear a support boot whilst I’m walking around to limit further damage until it fully mends.</p>

<p>Cosy: The media personality opted for comfort when it came to her footwear choice as she wore a white trainer on her right foot, while her injured foot was protected in the mobility aid</p>

<p>'It was a consequence of excessive running in lockdown whilst preparing for the virtual London marathon. Sadly it means I can no longer run on October 4th but should be back running home from work in a month!'</p>

<p>Away from radio it was recently announced that the health conscious star is the face and voice of newly launched fitness app Start 2 Run.</p>

<p>The app is ideal for people who need help getting started running as well as people who want to up their running mileage or aim for a particular running distance goal.</p>

<p>Users will have Jenni with them for all their training sessions, encouraging and motivating, as well as providing tips and pointers. </p>

<p>Unfortunate: On Monday, the broadcaster revealed to MailOnline that her injury has now forced her to abandon plans to take part in the virtual London Marathon </p>
