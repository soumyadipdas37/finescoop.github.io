<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sam Newman has received a visit from Victoria Police following his extraordinary call to Melburnians to take to the streets in protest of the city's stage four lockdown.</p>

<p>The polarising 300-game AFL champion and former Footy Show host sparked controversy on Sunday night when he called on 250,000 Victorians to gather in the CBD in 'hopefully a state day of coordination'.</p>

<p>The tweet landed Newman in hot water with Victoria Police, who threatened to arrest him for 'inciting a mass protest' against the measures introduced by Premier Daniel Andrews. </p>

<p>Newman was back on Twitter on Wednesday night to confirm he got a knock on the door and was spoken to by police at his Melbourne home. </p>

<p>'Efficient and personable x 2. Dan sent them in the van, to advise against 'protesting', which I assured them wasn't happening, and was never going to. Really. #victorialockdown,' he captioned the photo of the two officers in the lobby of his building.</p>

<p>These Victoria Police officers paid Sam Newman at his Melbourne home on Wednesday</p>

<p>Newman later posted the 'very pleasant' officers 'left a sheet with the official guidelines'.</p>

<p>His visit from the police sparked a divided reaction online.</p>

<p>'They’re intimidating people who are exercising their constitutional freedom to engage in political communication. It is absolutely abhorrent,' one woman tweeted.</p>

<p>Another added: 'This is outrageous. Daniel Andrews owes you an explanation. This is starting to look like the Stasi. I get enforcing public health measures but sending police officers to intimidate people posing legitimate questions about government conduct is dictatorial.'</p>

<p>Others defended the officers.</p>

<p>'Please don’t blame the police, they are doing a very tough job. I’m sure they would rather do many other things,' one person commented.</p>

<p>Newman had earlier backtracked on his original tweet, clarifying he was not encouraging people to protest. </p>

<p>He originally tweeted on Sunday night: 'Of all the protests that we have put up with, how about a quarter million of us gather in the CBD to take the City/State back, before EVERY previous march will have been pointless.</p>

<p>Sam Newman (pictured) said he was advised by police against protesting. 'I assured them wasn’t happening, and was never going to,' he tweeted on Wednesday night</p>

<p>Newman set the record straight on Tuesday. </p>

<p>'I didn't encourage a quarter of a million people to march through the street,' he told Sunrise. </p>

<p>'I said wouldn't it be great to have 250,000 people wandering through the city - I don't encourage people to do that but it was just a sign that this government should cautiously reopen business enterprises in the city before it rusts over.'</p>

<p>He reiterated calls for the Victorian government to reopen Melbourne as the city enters its fifth week of strict lockdown, which could be extended beyond September 13.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 90 coronavirus cases and six deaths on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'Everyone's business is essential to someone. How about, instead of announcing the covert figures every other minute of what is happening, someone comes out and says that it would a good idea if we got act to reopening, rebooting the city,'  Newman said.</p>

<p>'It is nonsense to think we have to close down the whole of the central business district because we cannot be asked or cannot be given free chance to cautiously reopen enterprise here in Melbourne.'</p>

<p>Sam Newman (right) backtracked on Sunday night's tweet when he was grilled by Sunrise host David Koch (left) on Tuesday morning</p>

<p>Newman fired up after he was grilled by Sunrise host David Koch, who tried to defend the lockdown measures.</p>

<p>'It is alright for you Kochie, you are lolling about up in the beach up there telling us what we should or should not do. But we're down here locked up in what is virtually a prison,' he hit back.</p>

<p>'I said wouldn't it be great to think that people would be that annoyed about what is going on in this city, looking it down completely without cautiously reopening it. </p>

<p>'I am not asking people to come from all over Victoria to protest. I'm not trying to get the police involved in this.'</p>

<p>'If they want to arrest me and put me in jail for this, that is fine. But I am not suggesting it. I never did in the first place.'</p>

<p>Newman later addressed his tweet on his weekly You Cannot Be Serious podcast, where he came under fire from co-hosts who labelled him 'irresponsible'.    </p>

<p>Sam Newman has called on the Victorian government to reopen and reboot Melbourne as the city enters is fifth week of stage four lockdown. Pictured is a jogger on his daily run on Tuesday</p>

<p>'All I was trying to do was get enough people to get attention … I'm not advocating for people to come from all over Victoria to march up the city,' Newman explained on the podcast.</p>

<p>'I'm not advocating a rally as such. I just said wouldn't it be great that 250,000 people would march in the city. That is hyperbole, that is designed to get the attention of the government cautiously reopening business.  </p>

<p>'I couldn't give a stuff if they open the city or not because I don't have a business but people are actually about to lose their livelihoods through the inaction and the tringent requirements that this government is putting on people.</p>

<p>'All they do is tell you how many people have died and how many have contracted this virus. There's got to be other things they can speak about.' </p>

<p>Newman fired off his extraordinary tweet after anti-lockdown protesters clashed with police in a dramatic stand-off in Broadmeadows in the city's north on Sunday night.  </p>

<p>AFL champion and former Footy Show host Sam Newman is known for his polarising views and Victoria Police has now threatened to arrest him for inciting protesters to gather in their hundreds of thousands to protest against Melbourne's Stage Four restrictions </p>

<p>A Victoria Police spokesman said the force had its sights set on those they claim are 'coordinating and encouraging protest activity' on Saturday. </p>

<p>MMA Fighter Vik Grujic responded to Newman's tweet by urging him to attend the Freedom Day mass gathering planned for that day in Melbourne's CBD - to which the footy great replied 'OK'. </p>

<p>'Victoria Police expects to make further arrests over coming days in respect to individuals suspected of inciting illegal activity,' a spokesman said.</p>

<p>'Organising and participating in this protest would be a serious and blatant breach of the Chief Health Officer's directions and jeopardises the health of the entire community.</p>

<p>'Those still thinking of attending the CBD to protest can expect a swift and firm response from police.' </p>

<p>The state's police force added its officers would not hesitate in issuing $1,652 fines or making arrests if breaches of Victoria's public health orders occur. </p>

<p>Victorian Police take a man's details in Dandenong in Melbourne's south-east on Thursday. The force said it already has its sights set on those they claim are 'coordinating and encouraging protest activity' on Saturday</p>

<p>In a video post shared by Channel Seven on Monday, Newman said he intended to gather with protesters in the streets of Melbourne on Saturday if COVID-19 restrictions in the city were not eased. </p>

<p>'They probably shouldn't [gather] but if the government act responsibly then we will act responsibly and not go there,' he said.</p>

<p>'Just give us a bit of easing of restrictions. I might use my hour's freedom and wear a mask and go into the city as part of my recreation and exercise and be part of the gathering.'</p>

<p>After one Melburnian suggested Newman had 'incited a riot' with his comments on Twitter, the footy great added: 'There'll be no rioting. No looting. No arson. No violence. Just an expression of desperation for our sanity.' </p>

<p>'Very irresponsible from Sam Newman,' she said. </p>

<p>'That's someone who was running for Melbourne mayor. If you want to be in lockdown for another six months then sure - join the protest.'  </p>

<p>Defending his position on the restrictions, Newman said it was the state government who were being irresponsible by enforcing economically-crippling social distancing restrictions. </p>

<p>'If the Victorian government stop being irresponsible through this blanket lockdown, then we'll stop being irresponsible by urging mass rallies,' he told Daily Mail Australia on Monday.</p>

<p>'Give the hospitality, leisure, education, business and public service enterprises in this state a paradigm for a responsible return to civilization, rather than the hysteria being disseminated, while the country and world pushes on, carefully.' </p>

<p>Sam Newman was flooded with responses following his plea to Melburnians on Sunday night</p>

<p>Melburnians were out and about enjoying the weather on Saturday, despite stage 4 lockdown</p>

<p>Fellow Melburnians desperate to regain their freedom joined the bandwagon on Sunday night in response to Newman's tweet. </p>

<p>'Just tell me when and where never protested before but this is the most important thing we have faced in my lifetime. We ordinary Victorians must take our state back,' one man wrote.</p>

<p>Another added: 'A protest at some point needs to happen so our political class can get a sense of the real opposition to the unbalanced measures put in place.'</p>

<p>Another fan commended Newman on his wording.</p>

<p>'You didn't even mention what march, and even mentioned a State Day of coordination. Could be a march for Prostate Cancer. Or even a Pro Dan Andrews march. Could be a march of social distancing examples. Very cleverly worded,' one man posted.</p>

<p>But not everyone supported Newman.</p>

<p>'I have read your tweet three times and it's still incomprehensible. But good luck with whatever self-indulgent, poorly-conceived action you're proposing,' one woman posted. </p>

<p>Another added: 'Of all the things you have said, this is highly irresponsible, you know your position... it's with these people's lives that you earned your living.'</p>

<p>Sam Newman has denied accusations he tried to incite a mass protest against stage four lockdown measures. Pictured are anti-lockdown protesters in Melbourne's north on Sunday night</p>

<p>State of disaster: Increased police powers to enforce the lockdown. Cautions will no longer be issued, only $1,652 fines or court summons</p>

<p>Curfew: No one allowed outside 8pm to 5am except for work, medical, caregiving - no shopping or exercising</p>

<p>Distance limit: Shopping and exercise can only be done 5km from home </p>

<p>Exercise: All recreational activity is banned and you can only exercise, with one other person, for one hour a day</p>

<p>Partners: You can visit a boyfriend or girlfriend who doesn't live with you, even if they live more than 5km away </p>

<p>Shopping: Only one person can go shopping per household per day</p>

<p>Cafes and restaurants stay open for takeaway, as do supermarkets, etc</p>

<p>Schools: All students learning from home unless they are vulnerable or parents are essential workers. Kindy and childcare closed</p>

<p>Funerals: No change to funeral limits, but only 10 mourners can leave Melbourne to regional Victoria for one</p>

<p>Weddings: Completely banned</p>

<p>Public transport: Slashed after 8pm and cancelled late at night </p>

<p>Newman's tweet sparked a divisive reaction from the public (comments pictured)</p>

<p>Metropolitan Melbourne is subject to stage four restrictions including an evening curfew and a ban on travelling beyond a five-kilometre radius of home until at least September 13 amid reports strict lockdown measures will be extended.</p>

<p>Regional Victoria is under stage three restrictions which allows residents to leave home for essential purposes. </p>

<p>Melburnians (pictured on Saturday) remain in Stage 4 lockdown until at least September 13</p>

<p>On Sunday night, confronting footage taken in Broadmeadows, in Melbourne's north, showed dozens of men dressed down in tracksuits and masks making their way through the streets as traffic was brought to a standstill.</p>

<p>The protesters claimed, when asked, that they were simply getting their daily exercise, which they are permitted to do within a five kilometre radius on their homes.</p>

<p>At least six people were arrested during the protests and police have not ruled out issuing further infringement notices. </p>

<p>Victoria's stage four restrictions are due to end in two weeks, but the Premier has indicated they will likely be extended. Pictured are anti-lockdown protesters clashing with police in Melbourne's north on Sunday night</p>

<p>The protesters claimed, when asked, that they were simply getting their daily exercise, which is one of just four legal reasons to leave home in Melbourne</p>

<p>Confronting footage taken in Broadmeadows, in Melbourne 's north, showed dozens of men dressed down in tracksuits and masks making their way through the streets as traffic was brought to a standstill</p>

<p>The latest protest comes anti-lockdown walkers were doused with pepper spray and struggled with police in Dandenong in Melbourne's south-east last Wednesday as community frustration with draconian Stage 4 restrictions reached boiling point.</p>

<p>Police issued $15,000 in fines and arrested four men.</p>

<p>Tensions in Dandenong had been flaring for days after a large group of residents decided to start walking at the same time and place.</p>
