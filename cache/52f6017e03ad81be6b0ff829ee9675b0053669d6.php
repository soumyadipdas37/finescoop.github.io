<p>Keeping it real: However, the former Desperate Housewives star also shared this honest moment with fans in April, showing off her grey hairs  </p>

<p>'Hi everybody. I am shooting in this small town in Italy. I am nowhere near the North, thank you for your concerns,' she said.</p>

<p>'Everyone was calling and texting me about the coronavirus in the north of Italy. It's really sad, but we're further away.'</p>
