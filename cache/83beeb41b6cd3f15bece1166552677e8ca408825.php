<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chafing shorts aren't just a hot weather accessory. If you thought chaffing was just a summer problem then sadly the problem can rear its head in the colder months too. </p>

<p>For an affordable and effective solution to chafing thighs, it might be wise to follow the hundreds of Amazon shoppers who are recommending the SIHOHAN Women's Slip Shorts.</p>

<p>Over 1,400 shoppers have bought and rated the seamless shorts, praising the ultra-soft fabric shorts for combating the 'dreaded chub-rub' and even calling them a 'wonder product' and a 'game-changer'. Even better, you can now snap up the bestselling yoga shorts for a mere £7.99. </p>

<p>The shorts are currently the number one bestseller in the 'Women's Yoga Shorts' category on Amazon and have now gone into Amazon's Lightning Deal </p>

<p>Thigh chafing results from friction and rubbing of the skin. Like sweat, cold weather and tights can play havoc with our skin, especially if it's on the delicate side.  </p>

<p>One way to combat the burning sensation is by adding a layer of clothing for protection. Enter the SIHOHAN Women's Slip Shorts. Unlike traditional underwear and shorts, these are seamless so won't rub or press as much, making them a great solution to sore, chafing skin. </p>

<p>Plus, as it's part of Amazon's Lightning Deal, it's never been cheaper to try the pair for yourself.  </p>

<p>The SIHOHAN Slip Shorts come in six sizes (from 26 inches to 37.5 inches) and are available in nude, white or black, so they can be worn unnoticed. While discreet enough to wear under clothes to stop chafing, they provide enough coverage to wear these alone as yoga or running shorts- so you'll get two for the price of one. </p>

<p>Seamless and designed without labels, shoppers are raving about how the shorts ease the uncomfortable rubbing around the groin and thighs, even calling them a 'game-changer'.</p>

<p>'Game changer! I love to wear skirts and dresses, but I've always struggled with chaffing, these are a fantastic solution.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, writing: 'No more chub rub! This does exactly what they are supposed to. They stay in position (don't ride up), they are comfortable and prevent chub rub. They also don't feel too hot as I feared they would. I will be getting another pair.'</p>

<p>The ultra-soft and seamless fabric provides discreet coverage so you can wear your favourite outfits with confidence</p>

<p>A third raved: 'I haven't tried working out in these yet, but for general comfort I would really recommend them. They are extremely comfortable and fit really well. </p>

<p>'They go down to around mid-thigh and have elastic around each leg. The waistband isn't super thick, meaning it does roll down a little and the material doesn't 'suck in'. They are ideal for under dresses/skirts and lounging around the house.' </p>

<p>Another enthusiastic review for the SIHOHAN Shorts wrote: 'I always wear shorts under dresses and have been looking for the perfect pair of shorts for ages. I have bought one pair and immediately came back to order two more. They are super comfy, they don't roll up, haven't really stretched since I have bought them, they don't squeeze the thigh, they're just perfect.' </p>
