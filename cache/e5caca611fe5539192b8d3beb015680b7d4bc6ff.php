<p>An honest mistake: Carrie Underwood forgot to mention her family at the Academy Of Country Music Awards in Nashville on Wednesday evening</p>

<p>Mike who? When the 37-year-old blonde beauty accepted the Entertainer of the Year award - which she split with Thomas Rhett - she left out husband Mike Fisher and their kids Jacob and Isaiah out of her speech; seen in 2019</p>

<p>The star was dressed to the nines as she held her trophy. </p>

<p>'First, I want to say that I’m a dummy for not mentioning my husband or my children in my acceptance speech,' she began.</p>

<p>'You would think after this many years of seeing other people do speeches and giving some of my own, I would think of people that are important to me, so I’m sorry!'</p>

<p>She added, 'But I do love my children and my husband.'</p>

<p>Uh-oh: 'I'm a dummy,' said the Cry Pretty crooner later while in the press room</p>

<p>The former TV star did remember to thank God.</p>

<p>'Thank you, God, so much. All glory, glory to God. Thank to the ACM not just for this, but for putting me in such incredible company. I am more than happy to share this with Thomas Rhett and to have my name mentioned with his and Luke [Bryan] and Luke [Combs] and Eric Church. I am beyond honored. Thank you, gushed Underwood.</p>

<p>Then she gave a nod to her work team.</p>

<p>'You guys, hold on. [Concerts] will happen again. Just hold on!' she said of lockdown. </p>
