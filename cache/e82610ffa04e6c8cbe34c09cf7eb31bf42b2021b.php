<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cyclones, floods and dangerous winds could devastate parts of Australia in the coming months. </p>

<p>The possibility has prompted authorities, such as the Bureau of Meteorology, to brief the federal government at its national cabinet meeting on Friday, news.com reported.  </p>

<p>The BoM forecast earlier there is a 70 per cent chance the country will be hit by an extreme La Niña weather pattern. </p>

<p>La Niña is characterized by unusually cold temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and linked with heavy rainfall and floods. </p>

<p>The weather pattern also raises the risk of cyclones and has been linked to a number of devastating natural disasters in the country over the past decades.  </p>

<p>Cyclones, floods and dangerous winds could devastate parts of Australia in the coming months (pictured, devastation of Cyclone Tracy in Darwin in 1974)</p>

<p>Cyclone Yasi was one of the more powerful cyclones to batter far north Queensland in 2011 (pictured, damaged boats in Cardwell following Cyclone Yasi)</p>

<p>Cyclone Tracy is regarded as one of the most destructive tropical cyclones after it struck Darwin in 1974.</p>

<p>Wind gusts of up to 217km/h caused citywide damage and chaos.</p>

<p>Eighty-per cent of the city was destroyed while 71 people were killed and 145 others seriously injured.   </p>

<p>Cyclone Yasi was one of the more powerful cyclones to batter far north Queensland in 2011.</p>

<p>The category five cyclone brought wind gusts of up to 285km/h and destroyed thousands of homes and crops.</p>

<p>Despite the destructive power of the storm, only one person died. </p>

<p>Southeast Queensland did not fare much better around the same time, with heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding.</p>

<p>More than 320 millimetres of rain fell in the region, while flood waters peaked at a record 4.4 metres.</p>

<p>Floodwaters caused damage to thousands of homes and the devastating rains killed 35 people.      </p>

<p>The Bureau of Meteorology has scheduled its next public update on La Niña for September 15.  </p>

<p>La Niña is characterized by unusually cold temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean and linked with heavy rainfall and floods (pictured, flood waters at Nambour Plaza in Nambour, Queensland in February 2020)</p>
