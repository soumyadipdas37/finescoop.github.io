<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Horrifying footage shows the moment a 4ft snake was removed from a Russian woman's mouth after it slithered inside her while she slept. </p>

<p>The reptile crawled inside her as she slept in the yard of her home in Levashi village in Dagestan, reports say.   </p>

<p>Feeling unwell, the young woman was rushed to hospital where she was put under general anaesthetic.</p>

<p>The footage shows the gloved hands of a male doctor removing the snake after inserting a tube down her throat.</p>

<p>Removed: The snake is extracted from the woman's mouth with a black tube (left) and is held up by a horrified doctor (right) at the hospital in Russia </p>

<p>As the unusual operation is performed, one of the doctors is heard off camera saying: 'Let's see what this is'.</p>

<p>A female medic grabs the snake with a horrified expression on her face as it is pulled from the woman's mouth.</p>

<p>She jumps back startled and medical staff scream as they realise the long length of the snake inside the patient.</p>

<p>The reptile is then dropped into a medical bucket, but it is unclear if the snake is still alive or how long it was inside the woman.</p>

<p>The ministry of health in Dagestan, a mountainous republic bordering the Caspian Sea, has not commented.</p>

<p>Operation: The snake was taken out of the woman's mouth while she was under general anaesthetic (left), before it was put in a bucket (right)</p>

<p>Locals say such incidents happen infrequently and older citizens advise the young not to sleep outside because of the risk of snakes slithering inside their mouths.</p>

<p>The female patient was not identified, nor was the type of snake specified.</p>

<p>The village of Levashi has a population of 11,500 and is at an altitude of 4,165 ft.</p>

<p>Some commenters claimed the creature could be a parasite or giant worm but it appears too big for this.</p>

<p>Other victims have complained of 'something alive' inside them after snakes slithered into their mouths.</p>
