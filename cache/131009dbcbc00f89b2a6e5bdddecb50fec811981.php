<p>The Sun has claimed people who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have boasted about their escapades online.</p>

<p>In July, the actress and presenter, both 33, had the country house demolished to create their own Georgian-style four bedroom mansion. </p>

<p>Raunchy: Michelle Keegan and Mark Wright's £1.3 million dream home in Essex is reportedly close-by to a dogging hot spot</p>

<p>The publication alleged an advert on an adult site read: 'The countryside near ***** is good for dogging and flashing. Loads of secluded laybys and woods etc. Also on the golf course at night. Seen some couples putting on a show after dark. You've just gotta drop lucky.'</p>

<p>A man in his 40s reportedly wrote: 'Out with my female friend this weekend for fun and frolics in the ***** Lane area. Good-looking peeps only.'</p>

<p>Another site dedicated to outdoor sex just years away from the TV stars new property is believed to have had a post which read: 'Loads of places near ***** and Chelmsford for dogging and flashing – socially distanced of course. The woods near the end of the road are great. Plenty of cover so fun to be had.'</p>

<p>Guidelines suggest you should remain socially distant from anyone in another household, remaining two metres apart where possible, or one metre with other measures.</p>

<p>Not shy! People who have engaged in outdoor sex in the rural area have allegedly boasted about their escapades online (their property pictured before they demolished it)</p>

<p>Technically sex or cuddling is against the guidelines, although you cannot be fined for flouting it.</p>

<p>Potential sexual partners should discuss Covid-19 and ask if they or anyone in their household have had symptoms or tested positive.</p>

<p>A representative for Mark and Michelle declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.</p>

<p>Make way: In July, the actress and presenter, both 33, have the country house demolished to create their own Georgian-style four bedroom mansion</p>

<p>The former Corrie star and entertainment reporter's new abode will feature a huge swimming pool, a bar and a make-up room.</p>

<p>Floor plans posted on the Epping Council website showed the couple's blueprints also feature a playroom for any future children.</p>

<p>The duo bought the home for £1.3 million in October last year, and the project is being designed by Essex-based company MP Architects. </p>

<p>Their luxury new home briefly caused concern recently, when the land was tested for asbestos. </p>

<p>Wow! Floor plans posted on the Epping Council website showed that the couple's blueprints also feature a playroom for any future children</p>

<p>While they had no objections from neighbours, they withdrew requests for 'demolition of an existing stable building' to build a 'one-bedroom annexe'. </p>

<p>Images of the ground floor show the home is set to give a nod to both their love of work and play, with a gym and bar placed either side of the huge kitchen.</p>

<p>The first floor meanwhile shows an equally impressive plan, with a balcony extending from the master bedroom, which includes a dressing room and make-up room. </p>

<p>Every bedroom features an en suite while cupboards are littered through the floor. The first floor features three bedrooms. Second floor plans show two more bedrooms and further en suites.</p>

<p>Set on sprawling grounds, the rear of the house boasts a swimming pool plan while the vast drive is set to accommodate a plethora of cars. </p>

<p>Their planning agent previously said: 'This new house has been carefully designed so that it is similar in area and volume to what is currently on the site.</p>

<p>'The new house will sit further back on the site and will create a much more functional family dwelling for our clients.</p>

<p>'The existing house has been extended several times and is not functional, therefore a new house would be a better use of the site.'</p>

<p>Exciting times! Set on sprawling grounds, the rear of the house boasts a swimming pool plan while the vast drive is set to accommodate a plethora of cars</p>
