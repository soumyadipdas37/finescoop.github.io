<p>Jose Mourinho is looking to add to his squad before the transfer window shuts on October 5 and has been heavily linked with a move for the highly rated centre back, but has not made an offer.</p>

<p>Fulham are also reportedly keen on Skriniar, who is valued at £45million, with Scott Parker wanting to bring in a defender after his side conceded 10 goals in their first three games.   </p>

<p>Inter Milan chief Piero Ausilio has insisted Tottenham target Milan Skriniar is not for sale</p>

<p>Ausilio confirmed there had been contact from Spurs but that they had received no offer</p>

<p>But Ausilio has reiterated that the Slovakia international is going nowhere and also confirmed Mateo Ranocchia would remain at the club. </p>

<p>'Ranocchia remains. There was a discussion with Genoa, but we decided to keep him with us,' he told Sky Italy.</p>

<p>'We think he could be very useful, on and off the pitch. Skriniar? I repeat: there was contact with Tottenham, but we reiterated that he is not on the market and we have not received any special offers.'</p>

<p>The 25-year-old made 42 appearances in all competitions as Inter made it to the Europa League final after finishing second in Serie A. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old made 42 appearances in all competitions for the Serie A side last season </p>

<p>The Inter chief also said there would be no new additions despite links with Marcos Alonso</p>

<p>The Italians have been linked with a move for Chelsea's Marcos Alonso after the left back was on the wrong end of a dressing down from Frank Lampard during his side's 3-3 draw at West Brom.</p>

<p>Alonso was said to be keen on a reunion with former manager Antonio Conte but Ausilio played down the links, stating there would be no new arrivals at the San Siro.</p>

<p>'The market ends shortly. Numerically we are okay, indeed we have to confirm the exits of some players. For now, there will be no new additions.' </p>
