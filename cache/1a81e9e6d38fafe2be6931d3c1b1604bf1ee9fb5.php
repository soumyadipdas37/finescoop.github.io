<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>British reggae band UB40 are the latest international acts that have been forced to postpone their Australian concerts due to the COVID-19 travel restrictions. </p>

<p>But on Thursday, UB40 issued a statement, revealing the tour dates will be postponed to April and May next year. </p>

<p>'We always look forward to trips down under, but we know it's only a temporary delay, we will be back,' the band statement said. </p>

<p>'The most important thing is that we all stay safe and we'll see you on the other side of this ordeal.' </p>

<p>The tour cancellation comes after lead singer Duncan Campbell suffered a stroke in August, from which he is still recovering from. </p>

<p>Fellow band member and brother Robin Campbell said: 'It was obviously a shock and very worrying when we heard about Duncan having his stroke, but he's having a well deserved rest and continues to recover at home.' </p>

<p>Tickets for the October and November shows will still remain valid for the postponed dates but can be refunded if the new dates don't work. </p>

<p>Fans who want tickets to the 2021 shows can buy them at Ticketmaster for Melbourne, Canberra Theatre Centre for the ACT and Ticketek for all other locations.</p>

<p>UB40's rescheduling comes after fellow British musician Harry Styles confirmed the Australian leg of his tour was 'postponed indefinitely' on Wednesday. </p>

<p>Red Red Wine will have to wait! The tour has been postponed to April and May next year</p>

<p>'Everyone's health and safety remains our top priority, which is why I unfortunately have to postpone all 2020 shows in South America, Mexico, Australia and New Zealand until further notice,' Harry wrote on Twitter. </p>

<p>'I really hope to play the shows as planned for 2021, but will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks and months.  </p>

<p>'I can't wait to see you all on the road as soon as it's safe to do so,' he added.</p>

<p>The announcement comes three months after Harry postponed the North America leg of the tour.</p>
