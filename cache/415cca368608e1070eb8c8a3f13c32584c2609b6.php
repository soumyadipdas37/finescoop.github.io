<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Kim Kardashian is reportedly feeling powerless once again amid husband Kanye West's continuing erratic behavior.</p>

<p>Amid a flurry of troubling tweets this week - some of which resulted in Twitter suspending his account for 24 hours - the 43-year-old rapper raised concerns even more on Friday as he posted a message about 'going to war' and his fears of being murdered.</p>

<p>Just two months after Kim and Kanye had marriage crisis talks in Wyoming it seems this time the 39-year-old Kardashian is going to struggle to keep her marriage together as sources revealed Friday she's 'at the end of her rope'.</p>

<p>'He's off his meds': Kim Kardashian is 'at the end of her rope' and feels powerless to help husband Kanye West amid his latest tweetstorm</p>

<p>'He's off his meds,' an insider told PEOPLE. 'He promised he'd stay on them. The last time, part of his negotiation with Kim was that he'd get back on his medication and he would work very hard to control his impulses. </p>

<p>'He made a lot of promises. And now those promises are broken, less than a month later.' they added.</p>

<p>Kanye and Kim wed in 2014 and share four children together, daughters North, seven, and Chicago, two, and sons Saint, five, and Psalm, one. </p>

<p>And Kim reportedly feels like 'she can only take so much' as her husband of six years appears to be going through another bipolar episode. </p>

<p>'It's the same thing over and over and over again,' the source said. 'He's on very thin ice with her right now, and she's truly trying to decide what to do to protect the kids, but also her own sanity. The whole thing is discouraging and difficult for her.'</p>

<p>A source said Friday that Kanye promised Kim he would stay on his meds and 'work very hard to control his impulses' but that the promises have been broken just a month later</p>

<p>Disturbing: Kanye West posted and deleted this message on Twitter early on Friday morning</p>

<p>The E! star was apparently taken aback by Kanye's latest tweets and wants him to 'take care of his own health'. </p>

<p>'She can't force feed him medication. She can't make him do anything he doesn't want to do.' the source added. </p>

<p>Early Friday morning Kanye concerned fans as he shared - and then deleted - a troubling tweet in which he expressed paranoia about being murdered and having his eldest daughter taken away from him.</p>

<p>'NORTHY I AM GOING TO WAR AND PUTTING MY LIFE ON THE LINE AND IF I AM MURDERED DON'T EVER LET WHITE MEDIA TELL YOU I WASNT A GOOD MAN... WHEN PEOPLE THREATEN TO TAKE YOU OUT OF MY LIFE JUST KNOW I LOVE YOU.' he wrote.</p>

<p>Along with the message Kanye shared a photo of North looking playful and throwing up two peace signs. </p>

<p>Concerning behavior: The rapper is seen here on Wednesday leaving youth services at Yeezy Christian Academy in Calabasas</p>

<p>The couple seemed to be back on track as they took a make-or-break vacation together with their kids to the Dominican Republic and camping in Colorado last month. </p>

<p>Before the trip, she addressed her husband's mental health in a length Instagram message, asking fans for 'compassion' and calling the situation complicated.</p>

<p>In an interview with Vogue last year she revealed Kanye didn't like taking medication because it changed him too much. </p>

<p>'For him, being on medication is not really an option,' she said at the time. 'Because it just changes who he is.'</p>

<p>Kanye's concerning post came after his latest Twitter rant which got him suspended for 24 hours by the microblogging site earlier this week.</p>

<p>He had shared a video of himself urinating on one of his Grammy Awards and posted a string of messages about his battle with record labels Universal and Sony - including screenshots of his contracts with the former.   </p>

<p>On Wednesday, Twitter removed one post featuring the phone number of Forbes' Chief Content Officer, Randall Lane. </p>

<p>Once the suspension was lifted, the rapper was tweeting again on Thursday, taking aim at the music industry and calling on artists to unite to change the system. </p>

<p>'You need help': Dozens of Kanye's fans took to Twitter to express concern at the rapper's disturbing post</p>

<p>The latest troubling development comes after it was reported that Kim was trying her best to support the Yeezy designer.</p>

<p>'Kim is holding onto her marriage with Kanye and knows that he bipolar and struggling with his mental health and wants to be there for him and help,' a source told US Weekly.  </p>

<p>'She is continuing to support him and does her best to understand him and where he is coming from. She knows he is unconventional and has always known that.' </p>

<p>All smiles: The 43-year-old designer (pictured Wednesday) appeared in high spirits as he left the academy amid his continued Twitter outbursts </p>

<p>Rant: Earlier this week the All Day hitmaker shared a video of himself urinating on his Grammy Awards and has posted a string of messages about his battle with record labels </p>

<p>Kanye first acknowledged his bipolar disorder in 2018, a condition that is associated with episodes of mood swings ranging from depressive lows to manic highs and can be controlled with medication.</p>

<p>Kim hinted last month that his struggle with bipolar was to blame for his recent erratic behavior, that has seen him embark on the unlikely bid for presidency and get emotional at his first campaign rally in South Carolina while discussing abortion.</p>

<p>Two months ago, the Runaway hitmaker ruthlessly lambasted Kim and her famous family on Twitter.</p>

<p>There for him: It comes as a source revealed wife Kim wants to support Kanye amid his mental health battle</p>

<p>During the aggressive tirade, Kanye alleged that Kim was trying to 'bring a doctor to lock [him] up' and compared her mother Kris Jenner to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.</p>

<p>He even admitted to his followers that he had been trying to divorce Kim for two years.</p>

<p>Kanye later apologized to his online audience and to Kim for the out of line tweets and he has since left talk of his marriage off social media.</p>
