<p>The woman, who is expecting her second child, decided to make a cake for the party three hours before it was due to start, and knew she had limited resources at her disposal.</p>

<p>So she purchased two white chocolate mud cakes and one caramel mud cake from the supermarket in a bid to piece one together for the impending guests.</p>

<p>The woman, who is expecting her second child, decided to make a cake for the party three hours before it was due to start, and knew she had limited resources at her disposal</p>

<p>So she purchased two white chocolate mud cakes and one caramel mud cake from the supermarket in a bid to piece one together for the impending guests</p>

<p>'I decided last minute to make a baby shower cake for mine and my friend's baby shower yesterday,' she wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I didn't have time to bake so a Woolies mud cake hack it was.'</p>

<p>She started by removing the store-bought icing from each of the cakes, something she was looking forward to picking at later on, she added.</p>

<p>Then she layered the cakes, starting with one white chocolate dessert at the bottom, then the caramel, followed by one more white chocolate, before sealing them together with Swiss meringue buttercream. </p>

<p>Swiss meringue buttercream is made using five ingredients: Egg whites and granulated sugar for the meringue, unsalted butter, vanilla extract and salt.</p>

<p>'Whip the cooked egg whites and sugar into stiff peaks, then slowly add the butter before adding flavours. It's out-of-this-world creamy, extra smooth, and the perfect sweetness for any confection,' Sally's Baking Addiction wrote online. </p>

<p>The outcome was a decadent white cake with flowers on top, an added touch she'd purchased from the closest florist.</p>

<p>'Oh wow that is amazing. How clever are you and congratulations to you both for your impending arrivals,' one woman wrote after seeing the final result.</p>

<p>Swiss meringue buttercream is made from cooked egg whites and sugar, butter, and flavourings like vanilla and salt. </p>

<p>You simply need to whip the cooked egg whites and sugar into stiff peaks, then slowly add the butter and salt before adding flavours.</p>

<p>Smear it onto the outside of your cake or between the layers of mud cakes for a sweet - but not too sweet - finish.</p>

<p>'Excellent finish on the cake. Those blooms though,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'What a wonderful job you've done'. </p>

<p>In a recent viral video Woolworths showed exactly how its mud cakes are made. </p>

<p>The short 20-second video by the user Food Factory Aus exposed how the industrial machinery clasps and flips the cakes upside down before dipping the top in the melted chocolate glaze.</p>

<p>The $4.80 cakes are available in a range of flavours including chocolate, white chocolate and caramel</p>

<p>After the glaze is added, the cakes are slid onto a conveyor belt before being moved to another section of the factory.</p>

<p>'We know that many of our customers really love our chocolate mud cakes which are in high demand throughout the year,' a Woolworths spokesman told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>'The majority of our Woolworths chocolate mud cake bases are created off-site by a leading Australian bakery supplier and then delivered to our store for our teams to complete the final touches.'    </p>
