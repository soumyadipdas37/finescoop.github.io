<p>Her boyfriend of four years, a web designer, was coordinating with his girlfriend in a striking red jacket, with a matching red face mask, with trendy Allbirds, popular among tech execs, which retail for $95.</p>

<p>The two are famously low-key, with few even knowing she was in a relationship when she was elected in 2018.</p>

<p>He also works as a consultant to help tech startups grow revenue using marketing and development.  </p>

<p>On Thursday the duo made the most of a committee work day - a day when there were no votes scheduled in the House - to make the most of their hometown.</p>

<p>The landscaped walkway, filled with sculptures and flanked by murals, is currently open from noon until 8pm, with a free timed-entry reservation system.</p>

<p>The site is operating on a reduced operating schedule, with fewer amenities, and limited capacity in order to allow for social distancing.  </p>
