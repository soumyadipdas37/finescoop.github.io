<p>A cleaner has beaten Vladimir Putin's candidate in a local election in Russia after a bid to rig the poll backfired.</p>

<p>Incumbent head of Povalikha rural district, Nikolai Loktev, chose his cleaner to stand against him 'to give the false impression of a real contest'.</p>

<p>Marina Udgodskaya did not campaign, but she still easily won with 62 per cent of the votes as locals flung out ex-policeman Loktev, 58, a loyalist in pro-Putin ruling party, United Russia. </p>

<p>The 35-year-old now feels shocked as well as ill-prepared to sweep her new broom through politics in this remote outpost.</p>

<p>'I didn't nominate myself. Nikolai Loktev asked me. There was simply no other person and I was like a bogus candidate,' she confessed to Podyom media.</p>

<p>She was there as a 'technical' or stooge candidate, a loser, she said, to give the appearance of a real race, a tactic not uncommon in Russia.</p>

<p>'I wanted to help him (give the appearance of a contested poll),' she explained.</p>

<p>'So there was only him and me on the ballot.</p>

<p>'I didn't think that they would vote for me, I didn't expect such a turn at all.'</p>

<p>Having cleaned politician Loktev's office for five years, she will on October 1 take over his desk and be in charge of 155 square miles of Kostroma region. </p>

<p>Marina Udgodskaya (left and right) did not campaign but she still easily won with 62 per cent of the votes. The 35-year-old now feels shocked as well as ill-prepared to sweep her new broom through politics in the remote outpost</p>

<p>'I must take office, and then the powers will be passed to me somehow,' she said.</p>

<p>Despite her reluctance, she has become an unexpected hero for anti-Putin politicians in Russia.</p>

<p>Opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov posted that voters were now ready to back anyone except ruling candidates obedient to the Kremlin.</p>

<p>'People are ready to vote for anyone else,' he claimed.</p>

<p>Udgodskaya will take over the position on October 1 and be in charge of 155 square miles of Kostroma region (pictured)</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter who you are by profession, or what experience you have.</p>

<p>'For the beginning you need not to steal and to be able to speak with the people.</p>

<p>'You will be held in much higher regard than any United Russia person.'</p>

<p>He told her: 'I suppose if you tried the presidential elections, you would win there too.</p>

<p>'Because 20 years of dictatorship brought one common wish - for change. Any change.</p>

<p>'And you, Marina, would not use Novichok, for sure. And this is the great advantage.'</p>
