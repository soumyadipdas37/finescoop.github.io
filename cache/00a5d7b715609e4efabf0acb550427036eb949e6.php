<p>The 68-year-old Irish actor even picked up a Best Actor Oscar nomination, but Jack said the role was 'almost' his.  </p>

<p>'I'd done camera tests, shot a couple of scenes, and then did a whole afternoon with Spielberg,' he told host Anh Do.</p>

<p>'At the end of it [Steven Spielberg] said, "Well, there's not much doubt."'</p>

<p>Jack said Steven then told him that he had to catch a flight to New York, but they'd sign the contracts when he returned on the Monday.</p>

<p>But while he was in New York, the legendary director met up with Liam and had a change of heart.</p>

<p>Jack said while the news was 'a bit devastating', he was ultimately 'OK' with it, understanding the nature of the business.</p>

<p>But he confessed the full impact of what had occurred only struck him 'months and months and months later'.  </p>

<p>'I'm on my farm, I've gone right up to the back hill, and I get off the horse… and [I'm thinking about] what had just happened with Schindler's List and I just [yelled]: "F***",' he recounted.</p>

<p>Describing Liam's performance in the World War II biopic as 'wonderful', Jack previously revealed he'd even spent months researching Oskar Schindler in anticipation of undertaking the role. </p>
