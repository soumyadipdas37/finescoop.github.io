<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> Hugh Grant has revealed how life as an older father has saved him from being a ‘scary old’ bachelor addicted to golf.</p>

<p>The actor, who turned 60 on September 9, has had five children in nine years after previously living a decidedly carefree lifestyle.</p>

<p>In an interview with the Daily Mail’s Weekend magazine he admits he has never been ‘Mr Nice Guy’ and adds: ‘I think I turned into a slightly scary old golf-addicted bachelor, and to tell you the truth I’m glad to see the back of him.’</p>

<p>Following a string of relationships with glamorous figures such as Elizabeth Hurley and Jemima Khan, Grant announced he was to become a father after a ‘fleeting affair’ with Tinglan Hong in 2011.</p>

<p>Over the next seven years he had four more children – another with Miss Hong and three with Swedish TV producer Anna Eberstein, 40, who he married in 2018.</p>

<p>Grant, who stars alongside Nicole Kidman in Sky Atlantic’s upcoming psychological thriller The Undoing, said: ‘I mean, it’s completely knackering trying to be a young father in an old man’s body and I’ve found that if you’re 60 and there are five small children in the house you can’t have a hangover either.’</p>

<p>He added: ‘But it’s worth it. Absolutely.</p>

<p>‘People say to me “You’ve got better as an actor in the last ten years... Why?” And I sometimes think it may be because of the kids.’</p>

<p>Despite his plummy British accent and tendency to play middle or upper-class characters, Grant insisted that he ‘didn’t grow up rich or privileged’.</p>

<p>While he spent his childhood in west London’s affluent Chiswick and attended the Latymer Upper School, which now has annual fees of £21,000, Grant has always maintained he was given a grant by the council to attend.</p>

<p>‘Money’s lovely. Particularly for me because, despite my sounding the way I do, I didn’t grow up rich or privileged,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘I know my voice is confusing, but my background was not a privileged one: My family weren’t seriously poor, but we weren’t rich by any means.</p>

<p>The actor now lives with Anna  Eberstein and their three children</p>

<p>‘We didn’t have holidays abroad or anything like that – I didn’t even go on an aeroplane until I was in my 20s.’</p>

<p>He said that his first job was ‘cleaning the lavatories in a pub’ for which he earned just £21. ‘I thought it was a fortune,’ he said.</p>

<p>Grant now lives in a six-bedroom Chelsea townhouse with Miss Eberstein and their three children. He reportedly bought the property for £17.5million in 2018.</p>

<p>He also owns a £500,000 house in a village in Sweden, and bought Miss Hong a £1million home near his in west London in 2011.</p>

<p>The actor, who is known for playing charming rom-com love interests such as bookseller William Thacker in Notting Hill, also revealed his desire to play more ‘revolting roles’ as he has got older.</p>

<p>He said: ‘I don’t know if you’ve ever talked to Richard Curtis about this, but he always found it hilarious that the public might think I really was that nice guy in his films, because he knew very differently. That was a real bit of character acting, because that Mr Nice Guy’s never been me.’ He added: ‘I do find that as I grow older I’m increasingly drawn to, and more comfortable in, revolting roles.’</p>

<p>Grant, who also played bachelor Charles in Four Weddings And A Funeral, has recently taken on villains including the evil Phoenix in Paddington 2 and politician Jeremy Thorpe in the BBC1 drama A Very English Scandal.</p>

<p>The Undoing, which starts next month, is about therapist Grace Fraser (Kidman) whose husband (Grant) disappears.</p>
