<p>But Lisa Vanderpump admitted on her podcast that she couldn't find many positive words about her experiences filming with Teddi Mellencamp. </p>

<p>The 60-year-old restaurateur revealed on All Things Vanderpump that she didn't necessarily get along with Mellencamp. </p>

<p>Boss: Lisa Vanderpump admitted on her podcast that she couldn't find many positive words about her experiences filming with Teddi Mellencamp</p>

<p>When asked why she thought Teddi had been fired by Bravo execs, Lisa said: 'I don't know, people said because she was boring.</p>

<p>'I certainly didn't have a good experience with her, so boring would be one of the nicer things that I could say.'</p>

<p>Teddi referenced claims she was let go for being 'boring' as she confirmed her exit.</p>

<p>Lisa, for her part, left the show in season nine amid a fall out with former friends Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley. </p>

<p>Over: Teddi Mellencamp confirmed she wasn't returning to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills after starring on the show for three seasons</p>

<p>'I certainly didn't have a good experience with her, so boring would be one of the nicer things that I could say,' Lisa said of Teddi; seen on Instagram</p>

<p>The 39-year-old star admitted she is devastated that her contract wasn't renewed and feels like she's breaking up with someone.</p>

<p>In a video message, she said: 'Hey guys, just here, hangin' with baby Dove.</p>

<p>'I don't want to bore you, but I figured I could give you a little update on what's going on. I recently found out that my contract as a Housewife is not being renewed.</p>

<p>'Of course I could give you the standard response of, 'Oh we both came to the decision that it would be best.' 'Nah, I'm not going to do that -- that's not who I am. Of course when I got the news I was sad. It feels like a breakup, almost because you develop such strong relationships with the cast, with the crew. And you get to do incredible things that you probably never get to experience without the show.'</p>

<p>In the past: Lisa and Teddi starred together on seasons seven through nine; seen with Denise Richards, Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley, Kyle Richards and Lisa Rinna</p>

<p>'I don't want to bore you, but I figured I could give you a little update on what's going on,' Teddi said. 'I recently found out that my contract as a Housewife is not being renewed'</p>

<p>She continued: 'That being said, I'm really looking forward to the future and being able to focus on my family, my friends, all in. I really feel like I have some exciting things ahead. And you know what? I'm pretty busy with this lil' nuggs.</p>

<p>'So, thanks for coming along on this journey with me and I'll see you soon.'</p>

<p>Teddi's exit from the Bravo show came days after Denise Richards quit after just two seasons.</p>

<p>Bye: Mellencamp thanked her fans for 'coming along on this journey'  </p>
