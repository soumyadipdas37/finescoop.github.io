<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daniel Andrews has been slammed for cracking down on the anti-lockdown protests after letting thousands of people gather for Black Lives Matter rallies in June.</p>

<p>Up to 200 protesters descended on Melbourne and clashed with police as the 'Freedom Day' rally spiralled out of control on Saturday.</p>

<p>Frustrated activists, furious with Mr Andrew's Stage Four lockdown, turned out in their droves to demand restrictions come to an end.</p>

<p>One crowd faced off with police on horseback as they chanted 'freedom' as officers arrested 17 people and gave out more than 160 fines.</p>

<p>The heated demonstration came months after 10,000 Melburnians took to the streets for the Black Lives Matter protests, when police were encouraged to 'exercise their discretion' when issuing fines.</p>

<p>Despite the massive crowds, only three fines were issued during the June rally. </p>

<p>The major differences between both rallies saw Mr Andrews' slammed on social media for the double-standard.</p>

<p>State MP for Caulfield and Shadow Minister for Police, Corrections and Community Safety David Southwick questioned the premier's consistency.</p>

<p>'Whilst No protest is ok at the moment, spot the difference,' he wrote on Twitter.</p>

<p>'1. 10k BLM protest - 3 organisers fined.'</p>

<p>'2. 250 CFMMEU protest - 1 fine.'</p>

<p>'3. 200 people protest Today - 15 arrests and 150 fines.'</p>

<p>'Where’s the consistency Dan? No wonder people are angry.'</p>

<p>Mr Southwick said the premier was being hypocritical as he 'rolled out the red carpet' for the Black Lives Matter protest. </p>

<p>'Victoria Police have had to take strong action today to clean up Daniel Andrews' mess who rolled out the red carpet for the 10,000 BLM protest.'</p>

<p>The Victorian Premier criticised Saturday's protesters, calling their behaviour 'absolutely selfish'.</p>

<p>'It is not safe, it is not smart, it is not law. In fact, it is absolutely selfish for people to be out there protesting,' he said.</p>

<p>'The only protest we should be engaged in, the only argument, the only fight we should be engaged in is against this virus.' </p>

<p>His comments come as the state recorded 76 new coronavirus infections and 11 deaths on Saturday.</p>

<p>In total, police arrested 17 people and issued at least 160 infringement notices for breaching the Chief Health Officer directions.</p>

<p>Police released a statement calling the march 'disappointing' and criticising attendees for 'putting the lives of Victorians at risk'. </p>

<p>Of the 17 arrests, 14 were for breaching the Chief Health Officer directions, while one was for assaulting police. They are all currently in custody assisting police with enquiries. </p>

<p>The protests kicked off at the Shrine of Remembrance but coronavirus-deniers then took to the streets, stopping traffic near Albert Park. </p>

<p>As a result of the protest, a police officer received lacerations to the head after being assaulted by an individual who was in attendance.  </p>

<p>Despite the hundreds of protesters in attendance, they were no match for the army of police. </p>

<p>The Black Lives Matter protests saw 10,000 residents hit the streets in Melbourne in June.</p>

<p>Health authorities feared mass gatherings like a public protest would spark a coronavirus outbreak and urged protesters to use hand sanitiser, wear face masks and stay home if they had coronavirus symptoms. </p>

<p>Only three protesters tested positive and there was no evidence of transmission at the rally. </p>
