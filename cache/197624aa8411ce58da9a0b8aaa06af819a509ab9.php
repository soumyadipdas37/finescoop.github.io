<p>Scientists are now working hard to save the apple of choice for many fruit lovers across the globe </p>

<p>Dr Richard Volz, a New Zealand-based food researcher, said growers in northern Spain have been having issues with their red apples for years due to high summer temperatures.</p>

<p>Growers say rising temperatures are causing the colour to fade and the fruit to lose its crunch.</p>

<p>Scientists have been working hard to save red apples as climate change has been threatening to kill them off</p>

<p>'The hotter temperatures mean the red colour of traditional varieties does not develop as it should,' he told the New Zealand Herald.</p>

<p>'The texture goes soft – and doesn't give you that famously crunchy feel.'</p>

<p>Apple colour comes from the certain genes in the apple skin and sets of enzymes which work together to turn molecules into pigments called anthocyanins.</p>

<p>Enzyme levels are controlled by a transcription factor – a protein that regulates how much a gene is expressed – called MYB10.</p>

<p>As temperatures soar the MYB10 and anthocyanin levels crash, meaning the produce fails to reach its typical vibrancy.</p>

<p>Mr Volz and his team have been working to develop a red apple that can be grown in warmer climates. </p>

<p>While the first commercial plantings of the new apple trees will begin early next year in Spain, consumers will have to wait another three years before they get a taste.</p>

<p>'A new commercial variety is the culmination of years of testing to make sure we have a tree that produces fruit people want to eat, that we can grow and store the fruit in a way that will make sure the eating experience is consistent, and that growers can manage their orchards appropriately,' Mr Volz said. </p>
