<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If Manchester United fans are searching for solace following their worst opening-day result for 25 years, there are examples of clubs turning around miserable starts to the season.</p>

<p>Howard Kendall's classic Everton team of 1984-85 began with a 4-1 drubbing at home to Spurs, followed by defeat at West Brom, and still ended up winning the league championship and European Cup-Winners' Cup.</p>

<p>Manchester United's first title under Sir Alex Ferguson in 1992-93 started inauspiciously; a 2-1 loss at Sheffield United and 3-0 home defeat to Everton.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer oversaw Manchester United's 3-1 defeat by Crystal Palace on Saturday</p>

<p>United lost by the same scoreline 25 years ago in their opening game against Aston Villa</p>

<p>Above all, there was United in 1995-96 – their 'You can't win anything with kids' season that saw them lift the Premier League and FA Cup double.</p>

<p>Fergie had sold Paul Ince, Andrei Kanchelskis and Mark Hughes that summer and, with Eric Cantona still suspended for his flying kick, fielded new names like Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Nicky Butt, David Beckham and Paul Scholes for their first match at Aston Villa.</p>

<p>They were thumped 3-1 – their worst scoreline on the opening weekend until Crystal Palace's victory at Old Trafford last Saturday – but even worse were the gloomy forecasts that followed.</p>

<p>Besides Hansen's immortal line about kids was a more forensic dismissal of United's chances that season with that group of unknowns – now immortalised as the Class of 92.</p>

<p>'Three players have departed; the trick is always buy when you are strong,' asserted Hansen to Match of the Day presenter Des Lynam that night.</p>

<p>'You look at that line-up of Manchester United, and Aston Villa, when they get the team sheet, it's just going to give them a lift. And it will happen every time he plays the kids.</p>

<p>'The trick of winning the championship is strength in depth. They just haven't got it.'</p>

<p>That 1995-96 result led to Alan Hansen claiming 'you can't win anything with kids' while a pundit on Match of the Day - only for United to go on and win the Double that season</p>

<p>There was also a chastening 2-1 opening defeat at Sheffield United back in the 1992-93 season</p>

<p>Hansen has been made to eat his words over the years. Those inexperienced players all went on to become famous England internationals and four years later were the cornerstone of the Treble team.</p>

<p>When Cantona returned from his ban, they gelled brilliantly. United won nine of their last 10 games in 95-96 to collect the Double and those 'kids' were the first to acknowledge the help their experienced colleagues provided; Peter Schmeichel, Denis Irwin, Gary Pallister, Andy Cole and Cantona himself.</p>

<p>Even now Cantona can't resist a dig at Hansen for underestimating the team after one match at Villa Park. 'Some people didn't believe in us especially one journalist, I don't remember his name, he played for Liverpool before. It's great to give an answer on the pitch.'</p>

<p>It's a stretch to suggest Solskjaer can transform United's season quite like Fergie did given the nature of the loss to Palace, and the glaring weaknesses in the line-up.</p>

<p>Sir Alex Ferguson watches on from the stands at Old Trafford during United's Palace defeat</p>

<p>Dan James isn't proven above Championship level and United will need to strengthen their side</p>

<p>Daniel James and Timothy Fosu-Mensah on the right-hand side aren't proven above Championship level, despite being given opportunities. Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof are good at defending the box but lack the pace if United want to play a high line and press the opposition in their half.</p>

<p>Paul Pogba hasn't been the same player since being denied a move to Real Madrid while Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Bruno Fernandes looked pale shadows of the team that went unbeaten in 14 Premier League games at the end of last season.</p>

<p>However, Solskjaer can go into the history books to suggest one defeat doesn't mean the season should be written off.</p>

<p>Like Ferguson, he does have young players who have come through the United academy and will only get better. Mason Greenwood started on the bench against Palace following his misdemeanours on international duty with England but will surely be part of the first XI this season.</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood is likely to play a major part this season, either wide or through the middle</p>

<p>Harry Maguire struggled against Palace as his difficult summer off the pitch continued on it</p>

<p>He can either contribute on the right where he excelled last season or switch to centre-forward if United do sign Jadon Sancho or another top-class winger.</p>

<p>Brandon Williams will put pressure on Luke Shaw at left back, Rashford is a class act and needs to develop partnerships on the pitch. United's only signing this summer, Donny van de Beek from Ajax, scored on debut and should start at Brighton – possibly at Pogba's expense.</p>

<p>'It has hammered home that we need to improve,' said Solskjaer afterwards, a clear message to the United board that they have to sign players before the October 5 deadline. United's rivals have all strengthened significantly in the window. Until the Glazers spend, there will be question marks as to whether they've been seriously compromised by the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>The Norwegian also has tactical issues to address. He signed Aaron Wan-Bissaka for £50million from Palace a year ago and the right back is one of the best one-to-one defenders in the league. But he's not Trent Alexander-Arnold or one of those full-backs whose natural game is to go flying forward and show off their technical ability.</p>

<p>There has been much talk about potential signing of Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund</p>

<p>'I say Wan-Bissaka is a fantastic defensive right back. He should focus on his defending and become a brilliant Manchester United defender who keeps clean sheets,' says Gary Neville, who played that position for club and country.</p>

<p>'It's not the case that because Trent Alexander-Arnold and Kyle Walker are two of the most outstanding attacking full backs in Europe, Manchester United have to have one too.'</p>

<p>There were alarm bells when Wan-Bissaka was put on the bench against his former club on Saturday – an indication that Solskjaer wanted to attack against a team sitting back. He is under pressure to entertain but on that afternoon it rebounded on United, who were themselves horribly exposed at the back.</p>

<p>Aaron Wan-Bissaka (left) was left on the bench for United against his old club at the weekend</p>

<p>Likewise, Maguire and Lindelof don't have the speed or mobility to look comfortable against players running at them. If Solskjaer wants to play a more expansive brand of football, he does need to find a different type of central defender to complement Maguire.</p>

<p>One signing can make the whole jigsaw fit together. United were struggling until Fernandes arrived in January and started to make the whole forward line tick.</p>

<p>United won't win the Double like Fergie's kids did in 1996 but history shows it's too early to despair. Victory against Luton in the EFL Cup on Tuesday night and three points at Brighton this weekend will start to change the mood. It needs to.</p>
