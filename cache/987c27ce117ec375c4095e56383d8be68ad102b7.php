<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the bizarre moment a violent fight dramatically breaks out between strangers trading insults at a petrol station.</p>

<p>In the clip, an inebriated man asks for a lift from a stranger before making crude jokes about his mother and then hurls beer cans at his car.</p>

<p>This enrages the motorist who furiously leaves his vehicle to throw a blistering punch at the man which sends him flying backwards crashing into the petrol station newspaper stand.</p>

<p>The incident was filmed at BP petrol station in Wilton Road, Salisbury, Wiltshire over the weekend.</p>

<p>It is unknown who filmed the clip however the footage has been circulating online since yesterday.</p>

<p>The video begins with the loud-mouthed man – who is swigging beers outside the petrol station – drunkenly asking the random driver for a lift to the Heath.</p>

<p>A violent brawl broke out between men at a BP in Salisbury after a man hurled a beer can at a stranger's car when he was told he would have to pay £50 if he wanted a lift to the heath</p>

<p>The drunk man asks the driver: 'Can I have a lift to the Heath or not?'</p>

<p>The motorist demands that he pays for the lift: 'Fifty quid mate!'</p>

<p>The inebriated male and his masked mate laughs at this request and shouts back vulgar insults at the driver.</p>

<p>The pair mate yell at the motorist: 'Fifty quid?! Up your mother's pooch yeh.</p>

<p>'I'll give you 50 smashes! How bout that? How bout that? Are you mad or something?'</p>

<p>The drunk man in the grey sweater then hurls a beer can straight at the driver's car.</p>

<p>This enrages the motorist who furiously leaves his vehicle and squares up to the inebriated male - shouting 'Are you mad? Are you mad?'</p>

<p>The motorist then throws a savage punch directly at the drunk man which sends him flying backwards into the petrol station display stands.</p>

<p>The inebriated male throws a vicious blow back at the driver before fleeing into the petrol station store.</p>

<p>The other occupant of the vehicle also brawls with another of the inebriated group in Salisbury</p>

<p>The motorist then tussles and chases after the drunk man's friend who runs away from the driver in fear.</p>

<p>The driver's friend has also joined the fight and is filmed aggressively brawling and shoving the drunk man in anger.</p>

<p>The drunk man seems to regret his previous insults and pleads with the driver's friend: 'I only asked for a lift man! I only asked for a f**king lift'</p>

<p>The motorist is then seen running back to the cameraman and shouting at him to delete the footage.</p>

<p>He screams at the cameraman: 'Put your phone away! Put your phone away! Delete that! Delete that right now!' before the clip cuts to an end.</p>
