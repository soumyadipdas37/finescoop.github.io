<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australia Post workers have been asked to volunteer to help get rid of the massive backlog of parcels - while their bosses are set to receive a $7million bonus payment.</p>

<p>The agency's entire Victorian workforce, including staff from administration and finance sectors, were sent an email on Monday requesting 'urgent' help to deliver parcels due to a boom in online shopping thanks to COVID-19 restrictions. </p>

<p>Workers would require a drivers licence, a car and be able to lift up to 16kg repeatedly to help with parcel pick-up services from facilities in Dandenong South, Bayswater and Brooklyn.</p>

<p>Facilities have been short-staffed due to social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic, creating a nationwide backlog.  </p>

<p>The email sent out by deliveries general manager Rod Barnes was obtained by Fairfax, who said the call-out was on a 'voluntary basis' and workers who help would be reimbursed. </p>

<p>'The work will involve minimal contact with others and you will be provided with personal protective equipment and training to ensure you are as safe and prepared to help your frontline teammates and our customers,' Mr Barnes wrote. </p>

<p>An Australia Post spokesman confirmed that parcel numbers were up 186 per cent in Victoria in the third week of August, and that asking workers to work overtime to help deliver was normal.</p>

<p>'That's why – like we do in the lead up to Christmas each year – we have put the call out to our Melbourne office team members to help us with our record volumes if they can,' the spokesman told news.com.au.</p>

<p>'Our people who help out on the weekend will receive time in lieu. We will also reimburse our people for the use of their cars as per our usual mileage and expenses claim process.</p>

<p>'So far we've had around 200 of our Melbourne office based team members express interest to lend a hand to their front line colleagues to deliver for customers during one of our busiest periods ever, particularly in Victoria.'</p>

<p>Australia Post had previously requested from the government that deliveries be made every second day up until June 30 next year.</p>

<p>The agency had also already warned of delayed Father's Day parcels due to the backlog and reduced shift work in Melbourne.  </p>

<p>The call-out comes as senior executives are set to receive a large sum in bonus payments after the executive team took a 20 per cent pay cut in March.</p>

<p>Ms Holgate is estimated to receive $1million while executives can expect to receive $600,000 if the board decides to go ahead with pay rises. </p>

<p>She explained that the executive team had done everything they could to continue work during a difficult period.</p>

<p>'It's pretty black and white … the [executive team] has led our business through one of the most challenging periods … and yet they've still delivered a fantastic result,' she told ABC. </p>

<p>'I'm very proud of them. Whether they get paid a bonus of not, the board can decide.' </p>
