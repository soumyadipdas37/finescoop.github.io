<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to accelerate a loss of employment for careers that are already competing with technological change, a new study claims. </p>

<p>Economics Professor Jeff Borland, from the University of Melbourne, found routine manual jobs such as factory workers, drivers and sales assistants would be hit hard by the crisis. </p>

<p>'Past recessions in Australia brought accelerated losses of jobs already under threat from technological change and globalisation,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'Should that pattern be repeated in the COVID-19 recession, routine manual and cognitive jobs will be most at risk.' </p>

<p>In addition to these professions are those which have been directly impacted by lockdown restrictions such as aviation jobs and retail. </p>

<p>In a report from September 14, Prof Borland said Australia's labour market was likely to face structural change due to the global health crisis. </p>

<p>A structural change refers to a large scale shift in the industries in which people are employed.  </p>

<p>In the past, recessions have led to accelerated employment losses in routine manual occupations Prof Borland said. </p>

<p>These industries are the those which have to continuously compete with automation and technological change resulting in slower growth in employment. </p>

<p>'In recessions in Australia in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, slow‐downs in employment growth and job destruction were concentrated in manufacturing, construction and trade industries – and among workers in trades occupations,' he wrote in the report.</p>

<p>'The extent of concentration of the employment impact by industry and occupation, however, became less in later recessions.' </p>

<p>Retail workers will be facing significant challenges in the post-coronavirus world with consumer spending patterns shifting to online, combined with automated technology such as self-checkouts. </p>

<p>Uber and cab drivers have also seen a downturn in business after coronavirus lockdowns caused travel to drop (pictured) </p>

<p>Factory workers are also one of the specific professions that have seen the brunt of job losses during past recessions as jobs are automated. </p>

<p>The report also states administrative staff will also be at risk of their roles being automated by information technology software.  </p>

<p>Border closures will also have an effect on the structure of the workforce Prof Borland claims, predicting the aviation industry and universities will struggle to bounce back.</p>

<p>'With on‐going restrictions regrading international travel, the composition of employment will shift away from international aviation and tourism; and higher education,' the report states. </p>

<p>Lockdowns have also affected Uber and cab drivers, with the majority of people opting to stay in rather than venture out for entertainment or work. </p>

<p>People using digital technology more during lockdowns will also contribute to a shift in the labour market.  </p>

<p>'If online meeting tools permanently capture just a small share of the inter‐state meeting market, that would have consequences for domestic aviation. Or increased use of online banking may cause banks to rethink some existing branch locations.' </p>

<p>Prof Borland predicts the first major shift in the workforce structure will be seen when JobKeeper winds up in March 2021 with further changes to follow as the workforce stabilises. </p>

<p>Beauty therapy (pictured) has been a profession that has grown in recent years and should remain resistant to the employment effects of the coronavirus </p>
