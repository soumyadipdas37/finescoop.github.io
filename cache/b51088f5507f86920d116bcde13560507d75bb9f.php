<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The detective who found serial killer Dennis Nilsen's victims believes the murderer got away with other killings that were never discovered.   </p>

<p>Hywel Jones was part of the investigative team who sifted through the suspect's garden in London in the 1980s.</p>

<p>The 59-year-old, who was speaking following the release of the drama series Des featuring David Tennant, believes there are other victims who went unreported.  </p>

<p>Dennis Nilsen (pictured) killed at least 12 young men and boys as well as confessing to dismembering them, boiling their heads and engaging in necrophilia</p>

<p>Mr Jones, who is now retired from the force after 25 years, told The Sun: 'Nilsen's victims were sadly missed by less people. They were "down and outs".</p>

<p>'The Met Police didn't want to properly identify these victims because it would expose the lack of resources they pumped into missing persons' cases.</p>

<p>'They could identify some of the bodies with modern technology as they still have the bones, but the victim's families have tragically never been told.</p>

<p>'I was relieved to see Nilsen go down for murder but he should have got done for more than he did. There are more victims.'   </p>
