<p>It comes after reports that the BBC are producing a new daytime chat show that will rival This Morning, which Holly presents with Phillip Schofield. </p>

<p>Corporation chiefs want to model it on their popular evening programme The One Show, with stars such as Stacey Dooley and Rylan Clark-Neal on the shortlist as potential hosts. </p>

<p>BBC executives hope the programme will also retain viewers from the Breakfast show, which draws an estimated nine million each week.</p>

<p>Reaction: Fans commented on the photo to praise the star for her sartorial choice, with one writing: 'You look beautiful and radiant, cute and amazing'</p>

<p>A source close to the project said: 'BBC Breakfast beats Good Morning Britain every day and The One Show is one of the channel's most loved and popular programmes, so the concept is based on that. </p>

<p>'The thinking is that if they can put a daytime version of the show on straight after BBC Breakfast, they'll keep some of those viewers, and will follow the same formula as The One Show but with segments tailored to a new daytime audience.</p>

<p>'Everyone at the BBC is very excited about this. They know that this could be quite the rival for This Morning, for the first time ever.'</p>

<p>Carla-Maria Lawson, Head of BBC Daytime &amp; Early Peak, added: 'Following the success of shows such as HealthCheck UK Live, Daily Kitchen Live and Your Money and Your Life with a mix of good company and expert advice reflecting their concerns, we're excited to be bringing a new daily, topical live programme to BBC1 at 9.15 following BBC Breakfast, and look forward to sharing more details soon.' </p>
