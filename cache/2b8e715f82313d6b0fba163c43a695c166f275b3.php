<p>The interim decision by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), which could be finalised later this year, would make it legal to buy and use vapes.</p>

<p>E-cigarettes that contain nicotine are illegal to have or use in every state and territory except South Australia, however they can be imported without a prescription.</p>

<p>Australians will be allowed to buy e-cigarettes over the counter at chemists with a prescription from their doctor under new plans revealed today (file picture)</p>

<p>The move by the TGA was confirmed by The Australian, which reported that e-cigarettes would be treated as 'prescription-only medicine', as opposed to being considered a 'dangerous poison' as they are now. </p>

<p>'The interim decision clarifies that nicotine for all human use is a prescription-only medicine and that possession without a script is not permitted,' the regulatory body's proposal says.</p>

<p>'The (TGA) delegate considered restricting access in accordance with a prescription is necessary to address the recent ­increase in uptake of use of e-cigarettes containing nicotine by young adults.'</p>

<p>The move would mean e-cigarettes were available with a prescription from chemists like Priceline and Chemist Warehouse. </p>

<p>They would still be unavailable for purchase in regular shops. </p>
