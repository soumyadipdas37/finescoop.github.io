<p>Smith said agent Peter Jess 'saved my life' and not when it came to the money, but rather that he believed him.   </p>

<p>'I'm eternally grateful to Peter Jess. The guy has saved my life, really. Not just with the financial side of things but making me realise that I'm not stupid or going crazy.'</p>

<p>Mr Jess is now pushing the AFL to urgently address the issue for their former and current players saying it should be a 'game changer'.    </p>
