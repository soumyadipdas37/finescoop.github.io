<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has been arrested on suspicion of stealing approximately $1million in valuables, including hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of gambling chips and numerous pieces of expensive jewelry from poker champion Antonio Esfandiari and his father.</p>

<p>The Las Vegas player and his dad Bejan Esfandiari returned home from a trip to California on July 13 and found $150,000 in cash as well as $300,000 to $500,000 in poker chips missing from a safe.</p>

<p>They claim Arizona woman Svitlana Silva, 46, broke into the home while they were away and bagged items including a platinum Diamond bracelet valued at $350,000, numerous designer watches valued between $2,000 and $35,000 apiece and gold carry-on suitcase.</p>

<p>The men reported the break-in on July 14 but on August 22 alerted cops about a poker tournament she had been involved in a few days prior on August 19.</p>

<p>Svitlana Silva, 46, is accused of burglary after approximately $1million in valuables went missing from the home of a poker champion and his dad in July</p>

<p>Poker champion Antonio Esfandiari and his father Bejan noticed items missing while they were away in July</p>

<p>Silva allegedly lost several rounds in the games where she bought in for $5,000, then $20,000 and twice for $30,000.</p>

<p>She later returned with a safe containing $300,000 in chips from Aria and the Bellagio, according to a police report.</p>

<p>Silva lost $100,000 in Aria chips but won after buying in with $200,000 of Bellagio chips according to police.</p>

<p>After winning that round she cashed out of the game but later tried to buy back some of the chips she'd lost earlier.</p>

<p>Although the winner refused, Silva allegedly text messaged them afterward writing: 'Hey, forgot to tell you my chips has special mark on computer so if it's stolen they can't cash out.'</p>

<p>It's unclear who shared the details of Silva's alleged actions during the tournament.</p>
