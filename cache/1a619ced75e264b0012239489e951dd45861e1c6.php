<p>Elouise Eftos received the disgusting message from Nixon on Thursday morning, just hours after her interview with Karl Stefanovic and Ally Langdon on the Today Show.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old comedian created a viral video earlier this week poking fun at the AFL for reportedly asking amateur dancers to perform for free on grand final day.</p>

<p>As part of her sketch she joked 'Ricky Nixon asked for my number. I think he wants to represent me'.</p>

<p>When Ms Eftos again poked fun at the disgraced former player agent on TV it did not go down well, with Nixon sending her a shocking direct message on Instagram - that she later shared on Twitter.</p>

<p>Controversial former AFL player agent Ricky Nixon (left) is under fire yet again after calling female comedian Elouise Eftos a 'fat ugly sl**' on Instagram after she made a joke about him on TV</p>

<p>After tagging Nixon in a post on her Instagram, the ex-player agent responded: 'Fat ugly sl**'</p>

<p>'Aw Ricky I wish I was as fat, ugly and sl**y as you babe,' she wrote in her Tweet. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Nixon for comment.</p>

<p>Ms Eftos initial video poked fun at the fact the AFL had asked dancers to volunteer to perform on the final day of the season.</p>

<p>In her skit she joked that doing so herself had been a major boost for her career. </p>

<p>'Things really changed for me after I danced at the AFL Grand Final for free,' Ms Eftos said in the video.</p>

<p>'It's amazing what the exposure has done for my life. Its changed it forever.</p>

<p>'So what I didn't get paid? Ricky Nixon asked for my number and I'm pretty sure he wants to represent me.'</p>

<p>After her initial joke about Nixon in her skit, she followed up by taking aim during her Today Show appearance.</p>

<p>When asked by host Karl Stefanovic if she had heard from Nixon, she replied: 'I didn't which is weird... maybe I'm too old for him?'</p>

<p>Her joke was seemingly pointed at his links to a Melbourne school girl in 2011.</p>

<p>Ms Eftos had initially joked about being 'too old' for Nixon, seemingly a reference to his much-publicised involvement with a Melbourne schoolgirl in 2011. Nixon always denied wrongdoing</p>

<p>Ms Eftos refers to herself as being Australia's first attractive comedian</p>

<p>Nixon was accused of being involved with then 17-year-old Kim Duthie, providing her with drugs and having sex with her in hotel rooms.</p>

<p>He always denied any wrongdoing. </p>

<p>The pair had met after Duthie posted naked photos of three St Kilda players online.</p>

<p>The incident sparked the downfall of Nixon, a once goliath of the football world who represented star players including Wayne Carey, Jason Dunstall and Gary Ablett Snr.</p>

<p>Before becoming the game's biggest player agent, Nixon played 63 games for three AFL teams - Carlton, St Kilda and Hawthorn - between 1983 and 1993.</p>
