<p>But Bella Varelis has well and truly proved she doesn't get the final rose during next week's finale.</p>

<p>The brunette beauty was spotted frolicking on Bondi Beach with fellow bachelorette Bec Cvilikas this week after the pair moved in together.</p>

<p>More pictures that spoil the end of The Bachelor: Bella Varelis cuddled up to a mystery man as she and Bec Cvilikas frolicked on Bondi Beach in tiny bikinis last weekend</p>

<p>Even though Bachelor finalists are encouraged to keep a low profile while their season airs, Bella and Bec chose to top up their tans at yet another paparazzi hotspot.</p>

<p>They made no effort to hide their friendship, chatting and laughing away as they put their towels on the sand.</p>

<p>Fans are now convinced that Bella and Bec's newfound friendship is a major spoiler.</p>

<p>Firm friends: The two women have moved in togetherÂ </p>

<p>Their closeness could be proof neither of them ends up with Locky, as the 'winner' is rarely seen with their former rivals in the lead-up to the finale.</p>
