<p>The Chanel model also had a black purse on her shoulder and was wearing a black face mask with sunglasses that made her look almost unrecognizable.</p>

<p>The model has only been working in the business for a few years, but she has already encountered her fair share of ups and downs.</p>

<p>She said: 'There are so many moving parts, especially being part of an industry with so many different people that you face a lot of struggles.</p>

<p>They are very close: Also on the trip to Mexico was her mother Cindy Crawford and her father Rande Gerber; here mother and daughter are seen modeling together in LA</p>

<p>'You have to wake up every day and choose that happiness for yourself, not for someone else and not based on anyone else.'</p>

<p>Kaia also claimed that people only see the the best of her life via social media.</p>

<p>The model acknowledged that her Instagram account isn't an accurate reflection of her everyday life.</p>

<p>She said: 'What you see in the media most times is the highlight reel. It's okay not to be okay sometimes. It's okay to be sad. It's okay to have bad days. Those aren't the days that we're putting on Instagram.'</p>

<p>With a robe barely on: The star's last Instagram post was this photo where she had pink hair</p>
