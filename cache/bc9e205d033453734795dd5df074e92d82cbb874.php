<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea have confirmed the arrival of Germany wonderkid Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen for a fee of £89million.</p>

<p>He becomes the club's sixth major signing of an incredible transfer window, taking their total spending to an enormous £230m. </p>

<p>The move makes the 21-year-old the joint most expensive player ever signed by a British club, along with Paul Pogba, who joined Manchester United in 2016. The Premier League transfer record is £145m, which Liverpool received from Barcelona for Philippe Coutinho.</p>

<p>Kai Havertz has completed his £89million move to Chelsea from Bayer Leverkusen </p>

<p>The German international becomes the sixth major signing at Stamford Bridge this summer </p>

<p>Havertz is also the most expensive German player of all time, and his signing also sees Chelsea smash their own transfer record, dwarfing the £72m previously spent on goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga, who is now set to leave the club having failed to live up to his price tag.</p>

<p>'I am very happy and proud to be here,' Havertz said. 'For me it is a dream come true to play in a big club like Chelsea and I can't wait to meet all the players and the trainers. Yeah, I am very happy to be here!'</p>

<p>This is the high-water mark on an incredible window for Chelsea, which has seen transfer chief Marina Granovskaia land all of the club's top targets. </p>

<p>Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner had already been secured before the window had opened, the Morocco international joining from Ajax for £38million, while Germany striker Werner arrived from RB Leipzig for £53m.</p>

<p>Both made their debuts during the friendly with Brighton on August 30, which saw fans allowed into the stadium at the AMEX to watch Premier League sides for the first time since March. </p>

<p>Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva have both been brought in on free transfers, while Ben Chilwell has also joined for £50m from Leicester City. </p>

<p>Frank Lampard's side begin their Premier League campaign on Monday September 14, when they visit Brighton once more. </p>

<p>More to follow. </p>

<p>Fellow German Timo Werner is one of the big names already through the door in west London</p>

<p>Thiago Silva was their fifth signing, with the Brazilian joining from Paris Saint-Germain </p>
