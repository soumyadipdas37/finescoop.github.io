<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The boss of one of Australia's biggest biotech companies has slammed Daniel Andrews' road map out of lockdown as a disaster and has warned there may never be a successful coronavirus vaccine.</p>

<p>CSL chairman Brian McNamee described the Victorian Premier's 'map for misery' as the most crushing policy for a dynamic city such as Melbourne as it recovers from a second horror coronavirus wave.</p>

<p>He also warned against the federal and state governments to assume a vaccine was on its way after Australia's hopes for a vaccine being developed in the UK was put on hold earlier this week.</p>

<p>The Melbourne businessman says he don't know anyone who supports Premier Andrews' plan of the city's strict stage four lockdowns. </p>

<p>'The Premier is saying his opinion won't change because of anger, but the truth of the matter is that I don't think he even understands the severity of what is occurring, both in the economy and also in the human consequences,' Mr McNamee told the Herald Sun.</p>

<p>Australian's second largest city will remain in stage four lockdown until at least September 28 after Premier Andrews extended it by two weeks on Sunday. </p>

<p>Regional Victoria remains under stage three restrictions which allows residents to leave home for essential purposes.Dr McNamee accused Premier Andrews of not understanding the severe impact lockdowns have had on the economy and or the human consequences.</p>

<p>CSL chairman Brian McNamee has described the Premier's road map out of lockdown as a disaster and a 'map of misery'. Pictured are police patrolling Melbourne's Bourke Street Mall on Thursday, which remains under stage four lockdown until at least September 28</p>

<p>He's among a host of business and community leaders who have slammed the Premier's plan out of lockdown this week.</p>

<p>Others included Australian Workers’ Union state secretary Ben Davis, Kmart Group managing director Ian Bailey, Harvey Norman chairman Gerry Harvey, Australian Retailers Association chief Paul Zahra and Melbourne Lord Mayor Sally Capp.</p>

<p>Dr McNamee also had a dire warning regarding the coronavirus vaccine, despite  CSL being charged as one of the companies to manufacture it in Australia. </p>

<p>He believes Victorian government’s lockdown strategy relies on a vaccine but warned it may be 'a very long way off'.</p>

<p>'We can't bank on a vaccine. I think the treatments are improving but we have to learn to live with COVID. We have to manage it,' Dr McNamee  told the Herald Sun. </p>

<p>Australia's hopes for a coronavirus vaccine are under threat after trials in the UK were paused over major safety concerns.</p>

<p>Late-stage studies of AstraZenec's vaccine candidate are on hold after a patient became seriously ill on Tuesday.</p>

<p>The jab being developed at Oxford University is the only overseas candidate that Australia has agreed to buy while other developed countries have signed several deals.</p>

<p>Australia has only one deal to buy a vaccine from overseas - the Oxford one with Prime Minister Scott Morrison under pressure to sign more deals. </p>

<p>Dr McNamee wasn't surprised about the vaccine trial pause. </p>

<p>'We’ve said all along everyone is working incredibly hard, we’re cautiously optimistic, but there are risks and that’s why at CSL we’ve got two vaccines we could manufacture because the likelihood of both working is not high,' he said.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 76 new cases and 11 more deaths on Wednesday.</p>
