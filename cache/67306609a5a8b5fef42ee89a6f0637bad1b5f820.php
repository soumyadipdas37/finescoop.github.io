<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Yorkshire's hopes of reaching the latter stages of the Vitality Blast were dealt a huge blow before a ball was bowled against Durham at Headingley on Wednesday night - after captain David Willey's positive test for Covid-19 ruled him plus three other members of their first-choice XI out for the rest of the season.</p>

<p>Vice-captain Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Josh Poysden and Matthew Fisher had spent time with the England all-rounder last weekend and the club's protocols meant all four were required to sit out the remaining Blast fixtures, including this evening's televised Roses contest at Old Trafford.</p>

<p>The club did not disclose the identity of the player in question but Willey revealed it was him on social media.</p>

<p>Yorkshire went into their final three group matches - under Adam Lyth's leadership - needing three victories to maintain realistic ambitions of making the quarter-finals but succumbed to a crushing 43-run defeat after limiting Durham to 147.</p>
