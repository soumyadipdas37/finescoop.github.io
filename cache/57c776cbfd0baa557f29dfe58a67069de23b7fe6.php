<p>The sale and consumption of alcohol in public places after 8pm is also expected to be banned by city officials, who could also reduce the maximum number of people at mass gatherings from 6,000 to 1,000 people.</p>

<p>France, Spain and the UK are all seeing spiking Covid cases - but only the UK has imposed new national measures, while France and Spain have used more-relaxed local lockdowns</p>

<p>France, Spain and the UK are bearing the brunt of a second wave of coronavirus cases in Europe, which comes after countries across the continent eased lockdown.</p>

<p>Until this week, all three countries had been dealing with problem using local lockdowns, targeted at areas where cases were rising fastest.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday the UK suddenly broke ranks with a raft of new nationwide measures, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said will last for the next six months.</p>

<p>In addition to cutting the size of gatherings and closing pubs early, he also urged workers to return to working from home - despite an earlier drive to get people back into offices - and banned indoor team sports.</p>

<p>He also increased fines for rule-breakers, and made the army available to help police enforce the measures.</p>

<p>That is not the case in Spain or France, where both countries have resisted imposing new nation-wide measures on focused on local lockdowns.</p>

<p>Parts of Madrid have been plunged back into full lockdown as coroanvirus cases in Spain have soared, but most of the city is still allowed to move around freely</p>
