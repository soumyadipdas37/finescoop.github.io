<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Freddie's Flowers saw a boom in demand for its home-delivered bouquets during lockdown.</p>

<p>The flower delivery company's customers surged by 73 per cent from 60,000 to 104,000 as Britons, desperate to brighten up their houses, were prevented from going to florists and garden centres.</p>

<p>Freddie's Flowers offers a weekly subscription for bouquets that buyers self-assemble for £25 – but one-off boxes can be ordered for £28.</p>

<p>Freddie's Flowers's founder Freddie Garland (pictured) said the firm was twice as busy as normal in peony season – which is usually the most hectic period of the year</p>

<p>Founder Freddie Garland (pictured) said customers had bought flowers more often and that the average order rate grew by 25 per cent compared with last year. </p>

<p>More than 45,000 boxes were delivered in one week alone. Garland, 32, said the company was twice as busy as normal in peony season – which fell during lockdown and is usually the most hectic period of the year.</p>

<p>The entrepreneur's parents are florists and he said he 'practically grew up in their flower shop in Pimlico'. </p>

<p>He started the company in 2014 in a tent in their back garden.</p>

<p>The company had to hire new staff during lockdown to cope with the extra demand.</p>

<p>Garland said: 'Luckily, sourcing stock was never a problem as we work closely with our wonderful growers.</p>

<p>'With florists' shops closed, many flower growers found they had loads of stock and little demand.'</p>
