<p>UK insight agency Perspectus Global asked 2,000 people to choose their favourite biscuit from a list of 20. </p>

<p>The results showed that 69 per cent of respondents chose the chocolate digestive as their favourite biscuit. </p>

<p>Jammie Dodgers, Bourbons and Crunch Creams also made the top 20, as did the American born Oreo and Maryland Cookie.</p>

<p>The survey suggests the older generation are most partial to a Ginger Nut, loved by 60 per cent of the over-60s but only 31 per cent of the 16-to-29-year age group.</p>

<p>Youngsters are keener on US import, the Oreo, with 63 per cent picking it as a favourite compared to just 15 per cent of the over-60s.</p>

<p>Shortbread (pictured) came in second, with chocolate fingers, Jaffa Cakes and chocolate Hobnobs making up the remaining top five</p>

<p>And when it comes to the biggest biscuit lovers in the UK, the folk of Norwich scoff 650-a-year, more than any other British city.</p>

<p>Ellie Glason Director at Perspectus Global commented, 'We were surprised to see just how much the nation still loves a biscuit – and especially the people of Norwich who get through a staggering 650-a-year.</p>

<p>'It's also interesting to see from the research that American imports such as the Oreo and Maryland cookie have found their way into the top 20, even beating the Garibaldi and fig roll.</p>

<p>'Yet the British public clearly still hold the chocolate digestive close to their hearts, with the biscuit emerging as the clear winner of the poll'</p>

<p>Our favourite way to enjoy the snacks is with a hot beverage. A third of us would like a cup of tea (33 per cent), while 22 percent pick coffee.</p>

<p>And youngsters are keeping the dunk alive with 23 per cent of 16 to 29-year old's saying they dunk, compared to just 11 percent of over 60s.</p>
