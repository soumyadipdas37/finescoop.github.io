<p>The crash happened near Nelsonia, along Mason Road, on Monday afternoon. </p>

<p>A Navy spokesman confirmed to DailyMail.com that all four people on board - two pilots, two crew members - bailed out of the EC-2 Hawkeye before it crashed. </p>

<p>An E-2C Hawkeye, similar to the one pictured, crashed on Monday in Virginia</p>

<p>The plane was reportedly flying from the Norfolk air base. </p>

<p>Aurora Intel, a monitoring service, said that a C-30J (OTIS22) and a T-38 (MIG2) were flying over the crash site. </p>

<p>The U.S. Naval Academy describes the Hawkeye as 'the Navy's all-weather, carrier-based tactical battle management airborne early warning, command and control aircraft.' </p>

<p>The plane is a twin engine, five crewmember, high-wing turboprop aircraft.</p>

<p>Hawkeyes have a distinctive 24-foot diameter radar rotodome - a rotating radar - attached to the upper fuselage. </p>

<p>The Navy describes the Hawkeye as 'the eyes of the fleet', and they have been used since the Vietnam War. </p>

<p>The current version of the Hawkeye, the E-2C, became operational in 1973, and surpassed one million flight hours in August 2004, the Navy said. </p>
