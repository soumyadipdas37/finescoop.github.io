<p>Mikel Arteta's side will be hopeful of a positive start to their campaign after finishing the last one so strongly and winning the FA Cup. The Gunners have added the likes of Willian and Gabriel Magalhaes to the squad as the aim for a return to Champions League football.</p>

<p>It should be a tough first game for Scott Parker's side in their first game back in the top flight, but will be confident of upsetting the odds at the cottage.</p>

<p>Sportsmail's Danny Gallagher will provide live EPL coverage of Fulham vs Arsenal including live score, lineups and build-up. </p>
