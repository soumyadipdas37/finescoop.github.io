<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea want out-of-favour Antonio Rudiger to sign a contract extension before they will allow him to leave on loan, according to the Daily Mirror.</p>

<p>Tottenham, West Ham and Paris Saint-Germain are all interesting in the Germany defender, 27.</p>

<p>But the Blues are unwilling to enter talks unless Rudiger signs a 12-month extension to his current contract, which has 18 months left to run.</p>

<p>Defender Antonio Rudiger has fallen out of favour at Chelsea under manager Frank Lampard</p>

<p>Chelsea do not want to lose him on a free transfer when his contract expires in 2022.</p>

<p>Tottenham have been the latest club to show an interest in Rudiger.</p>

<p>The 27-year-old has fallen out of favour at Chelsea and has been omitted from Frank Lampard's last three squads against West Bromwich Albion, Barnsley and Liverpool. </p>

<p>West Ham United and Paris Saint-Germain have shown interest in taking Rudiger on a season-long loan.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva's arrival has extinguished any faint hope of Rudiger returning to the starting XI</p>

<p>Tottenham are also monitoring the Germany international with Chelsea unlikely to allow a player to join a rival on a temporary deal, according to Sky Sports. </p>

<p>Rudiger's last appearance for the Blues came in the FA Cup final defeat to Arsenal in early August, when he was partly culpable for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's winner in a 2-1 defeat.</p>

<p>Despite his role in helping convince compatriots Kai Havertz and Timo Werner to join him at Stamford Bridge this summer, Rudiger appears to have reached the end of the road in SW6. </p>

<p>Chelsea have already received an offer from Paris Saint-Germain for the imposing centre back, with the French champions also looking to strike up a loan deal with an option to buy.   </p>
