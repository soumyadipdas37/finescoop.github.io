<p>Cheers to moving on: Bobby Norris has revealed their is no bad blood between himself and Amy Childs after they addressed their six-year feud in a recent episode of TOWIE</p>

<p>Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'. </p>

<p>Speaking to Fubar host Stephen Leng about their dispute, Bobby said: 'There's kind of no ill feeling my side. It's great to have her back on the show.</p>

<p>He continued: 'I'm one of them people babe, I don't harbour grudges with anyone and it was never really our problem. I would never hold it against her what happened between me and her cousin and vice versa.'</p>

<p>No feuds here! The reality star, 34, who used to date Amy's cousin Harry Derbidge, said that he has no ill-feeling and they both made 'b*tchy comments' when Harry cheated on Bobby with his ex-boyfriend during their romance</p>

<p>Bobby has clearly grown up a lot since the fall out and admits that it shouldn't be dwelled upon any more: </p>

<p>'Everyone's moved on and like years have passed and we're in a global pandemic, do you know what I mean, so we can't be worrying about something from six years ago. </p>

<p>'There's enough going on in the world, there's enough going on in Essex to worry about, let alone something from back in the day.'   </p>

<p>Burying the hatchet: The duo confronted each other over their long-running row during Sunday's episode of the reality show, and decided to lay their spat to rest after TOWIE original Amy made her return to the show</p>

<p>During a 2014 The Only Way Is Marbs episode, Harry admitted to cheating on Bobby with his ex, and following the relevation Bobby had some cross-words with Amy.</p>

<p>In a recent interview with The Sun, Amy discussed what went down between her and the reality star: 'Bobby said some bitchy things and I said some bitchy things and it was just one of those fallouts where we didn't really speak after that.</p>

<p>'It was such a long time ago but I knew it was still going to be awkward between us because I was coming back to the show.' </p>

<p>Friends again? Discussing their fall out, Bobby was keen to acknowledge that 'feud is quite a strong word' but that 'we didn't remain BFFs'</p>
