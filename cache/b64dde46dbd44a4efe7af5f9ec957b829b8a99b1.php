<p>A banner reading 'COVID FTS' was also seen hanging on the wall of the prison</p>

<p>A second fire was lit in the afternoon, which was also put out after three hours, while a third blaze was set late on Monday night, which officers also dealt with.</p>

<p>QCS says a number of additional inmates and an officer were treated for smoke inhalation.</p>

<p>'Officers from Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre have been praised for their professionalism and resilience in dealing with a complex situation,' QCS said in a statement.</p>

<p>A banner reading 'COVID FTS' has also been seen hung across one of the walls of the prison.</p>

<p>Queensland Corrective Services Commissioner Peter Martin said as many as 20 inmates were involved in the riots, Nine News reported.</p>

<p>CCTV cameras were also damaged while huge piles of rubbish were seen strewn outside inmate's cells on Tuesday. </p>

<p>As many as 20 inmates were involved in the havoc at the prison after being confined in lockdown</p>

<p>'We are in a 14-day isolation period, currently we're at about day four, and so this has got a fair way to go and the prisoner population has largely been compliant,' Mr Martin said.</p>

<p>'This is a difficult situation and it's one that will go on for a considerable period of time until no further COVID-19 cases occur.' </p>

<p>Mr Martin said there had been at least three instances where a 'code black' was called while nurses walked off the job on Monday evening, worried for their safety, The Courier Mail was told.</p>

<p>The Queensland Police Dog Squad was also called in as well as firefighters and paramedics. </p>

<p>More than 1000 inmates are at Arthur Gorrie, which has capacity for 890 prisoners. </p>

<p>They have been kept in their cells for the past five days after Queensland's chief health officer ordered a lockdown of prisons to stem the local virus outbreak.</p>

<p>More than 1000 inmates are at Arthur Gorrie, which has capacity for 890 prisoners</p>

<p>Another 6000 inmates in jails from the central coast to southeast Queensland also remain confined to their cells.</p>

<p>Corrections workers union secretary Alex Scott, who warned last week that the lockdown would lead to more violence against prison workers, said the incident was deeply concerning.</p>

<p>While he still supported the lockdown to stem the virus, he said the fires highlighted the important of prison safety for staff and inmates.</p>

<p>'The staff at the centre are continuing their work in very difficult circumstances in a dedicated, professional way and deserve our respect,' he said in a statement.</p>

<p>'We will continue to engage with management at the centre and with QCS to ensure that our concerns about workplace health and safety at our prisons are addressed.'</p>

<p>Arthur Gorrie is directly linked to the 27-case COVID-19 cluster in the state's southeast after two staff contracted the virus following a visit to the QCS Academy at Wacol.</p>

<p>The academy, where a senior trainer was diagnosed with the virus on Thursday, is at the centre of the state's outbreak.</p>
