<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A group of heroes who desperately tried to save a surfer who was fatally mauled by a shark have given their account of his final moments to let his family know he was not alone. </p>

<p>Gold Coast real estate agent Nick Slater, 46, was among at least 40 other surfers when he was bitten on the leg by a great white at Greenmount Beach on Tuesday. </p>

<p>Fellow wave riders Zane Hall, 14, a high school student, occupational therapist Alicia Bain, 27, and tradesman Jason Gibbs rushed to him and tried to bring him to shore.</p>

<p>Hall was close to Mr Slater and saw the shark charging toward him.</p>

<p>Nick Slater (pictured), 46, tragically died on Tuesday after being mauled by a great white at Greenmount Beach, in the Gold Coast</p>

<p>'[He] straight away turned to the victim, Nick Slater, to warn him but there was no time,' family friend Kerry Gill told 9News. </p>

<p>While Hall raised the alarm for help and to get others out of the water, Ms Bain was the first to reach Mr Slater, closely followed by Mr Gibbs. </p>

<p>The pair had noticed surfers acting oddly in the line up, before noticing Mr Slater floating unresponsive on his board.  </p>

<p>'I jumped off my board and tried to assist Nick as best I could and give him the best possible chance at the moment,' she said. </p>

<p>Mr Gibbs said they had no idea how bad the situation was until they arrived.</p>

<p>'As soon as I got there, I knew he was gone,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.</p>

<p>The trio did everything they could to try and save Mr Slater as they made their way to shore.  </p>

<p>Schoolboy Zane Hall (pictured), 14, tried to warn Mr Slater about the shark after seeing it charging towards him</p>

<p>Despite the best efforts of witnesses and lifesavers, he passed away on the beach. </p>

<p>'Seeing Nick out there I was just thinking if it was one of our loved ones or friends out there, you’d want someone to go out there and give them the best chance of surviving, Ms Bain said </p>

<p>Mr Gibbs added: '[I] just hope [Mr Slater's family] can get some closure knowing right until the end there was caring, heroic people trying to help.'  </p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's office has nominated the three heroes for bravery awards for their valiant efforts in last week's tragedy.  </p>

<p>Mr Slater's death was the first fatal shark attack in the area since 1958.  </p>

<p>His injury stretched from his hip to his knee. </p>

<p>Tradesman Jason Gibbs (pictured) said he hopes Mr Slater's family can an get some closure knowing he was cared for right until the end</p>

<p>Mr Gibbs and Ms Bain have been haunted by memories of the horrific attack since.</p>

<p>'When I went to bed that night it was hard. I cried myself to sleep,' Mr Gibbs said. </p>

<p>A week on, a gigantic shark has been spotted at a popular beach 90km south from where Mr Slater was killed. </p>

<p>A video was posted to Instagram by Madison Stewart on Monday showing a predator lurking around Ballina and Evans Head, in northern New South Wales.</p>

<p>'Let’s steer clear of Ballina/Evans Heads surf breaks for a little while folks,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Dead whale has attracted some sharks.' </p>

<p>The sighting was the third in the area since Friday after a 20m long whale carcass washed into Patches Beach in Ballina last week.   </p>

<p>Local authorities believe the male sperm whale washed a shore and drowned. A warning was issued for swimmers to avoid the area.   </p>
