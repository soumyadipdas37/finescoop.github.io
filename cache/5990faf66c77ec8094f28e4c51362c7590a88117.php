<p>The 'As Long as You Love Me' hitmaker explained that he's now 'motivated by truth and love' and what he values in life has changed.</p>

<p>He wrote alongside a studio snap of himself: 'I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada. I didn't have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music. But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in. </p>

<p>'My values slowly started to change. Ego and power started to takeover and my relationships suffered because of it. I truly desire healthy relationships. </p>

<p>'I want to walk in the plans God has for me and not try and do it on my own! I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad!</p>

<p>'I'm grateful that I can walk with Jesus as he leads the way.'</p>
