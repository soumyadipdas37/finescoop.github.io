<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alex Goode is primed to deputise for the banned Owen Farrell in Saracens’ No 10 shirt against Leinster on Saturday and he will relish the added responsibility — even if it makes his mother uneasy.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old former England full-back is set to fill in at fly-half for the holders in their momentous Heineken European Cup quarter-final in Dublin, in the enforced absence of the England captain. Goode is not fazed by the prospect of a head-to-head with Irish Lion Jonny Sexton, but it is causing parental jitters.</p>

<p>‘I enjoy it more than my Mum does,’ he said of operating at No 10, as he did in last year’s quarter-final win over Glasgow. ‘My mum doesn’t like me getting tackled. She gets nervous about me getting injured, she doesn’t like me goal-kicking — she’d rather I was on the bench!</p>

<p>Alex Goode is primed to deputise for Owen Farrell in Saracens’ No 10 shirt against Leinster</p>

<p>‘Naturally, as someone who plays that position, you have to enjoy the pressure. If I didn’t enjoy it, I’d be in the wrong job. I do enjoy it.’</p>

<p>Reflecting on filling the void left by Farrell, Goode added: ‘They’re pretty hard shoes to fill. You can’t compare anyone to Owen. He’s a special player who plays his own way, but it’s a team that isn’t built around one person.’</p>

<p>The fixture is a major focus for Saracens as they seek to claim another European triumph before accepting relegation from the Premiership.</p>

<p>‘We are the last team to beat them (Leinster) and we hope that it sits in their minds. We don’t want to give up our title easily,’ Goode said.</p>
