<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New technology from Telstra will allow mobile phone users to permanently banish SIM cards and the fiddly ejector tools that help access them.</p>

<p>The eSIM card is a rewritable piece of software that stores a user's data and allows customers to use multiple phone numbers on one device even if they don't have a dual-SIM mobile.</p>

<p>This means no more scrambling to find a safety pin or the back of an earring to eject and remove a SIM card when your phone dies. </p>

<p>Mobile phone users will now be able to transfer to an eSIM without setting foot in a store after a new app was launched by Telstra (stock image)</p>

<p> eSIMS were launched in 2019, but until now users had to visit a store or wait for the installation details to be posted out to make the change.</p>

<p>Telstra has now set up a corresponding digital service to manage the tool without the need for customers to visit a store. </p>

<p>The new digital offering through the My Telstra app will allow customers to manage the eSIM service completely online and transfer their mobile phone number in just two minutes instead of the days it can take doing so face-to-face.  </p>

<p>Mobile phone users can now say goodbye to SIM cards and their fiddly ejector tools forever</p>

<p>It's as simple as logging onto the app, selecting the device they want to transfer to an eSIM, and confirming it all via a unique code sent to the phone. </p>

<p>But the perk will only be available for Telstra customers who have compatible devices.</p>

<p>Some of the eligible mobile phones will include the Apple iPhone 12, Motorola Razr 4G Fold and a number of newer-model Samsung Galaxy Notes and S20s with 5G. </p>

<p>Getting the eSIM up and running is simple and can be done online</p>
