<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Saracens are one loss from limbo-land after the Government’s new coronavirus restrictions look to have set back the start of rugby’s second-tier Championship.</p>

<p>The European Cup semi-finalists, relegated after a Sportsmail investigation exposed their salary cap breaches, have no idea when their next meaningful game will be if they lose to Racing 92 this Saturday.</p>

<p>They are about to ‘fall off a steep cliff’ as one source put it, as it is understood the Championship’s 2020-21 season may not now start until the New Year.</p>

<p>Saracens will face Racing 92 in the Heineken Champions Cup semi-finals on Saturday</p>

<p>With no prospect of fans returning to grounds soon, most second-tier clubs don’t have the finances to resume paying players.</p>

<p>Saracens boss Mark McCall said: ‘It was looking likely that the Championship season would start in mid-December, but that may have changed which is really worrying for the Championship clubs, ourselves included.</p>

<p>‘It doesn’t take a genius to guess that if England don’t get crowds during the autumn and the Premiership doesn’t start having crowds before Christmas, it’s going to be a really worrying time for the international scene and also club level. It’s obviously very serious.’</p>

<p>Next week the RFU are set to meet with Championship club owners to thrash out a plan for the season, but sources have told Sportsmail some teams are not even intending to train until November.</p>

<p> Doubts over the start of new Championship could have serious implications for Saracens</p>

<p>The England stars staying at Sarries —Owen Farrell, Jamie George, Maro Itoje, Elliot Daly and the Vunipola brothers — will have Tests between October and December, then a Six Nations in 2021 to prepare for.</p>

<p>But McCall has not ruled out loaning the internationals to other clubs next Spring if some need game-time before the Lions tour.</p>

<p>‘We will see whether they need any more games, or if a few Championship games will suffice,’ he said.</p>

<p>Six hours before Tuesday's test event against Gloucester, Bath were told by the Government they were not allowed to host 1,000 fans. Bristol’s test event — their Leicester match next Wednesday — was also canned.</p>

<p>There are fears among Premiership clubs that more drastic wage cuts and redundancies may have to follow in 2021 if fans do not return or a state bail-out is not sufficient.</p>

<p>Bath chief executive Tarquin McDonald said: ‘The longer this goes on, the more difficult it’s going to be for the survival of a number of clubs.</p>

<p>‘We need to see full crowds back by the Spring. If that doesn’t happen it’s really very challenging.’</p>
