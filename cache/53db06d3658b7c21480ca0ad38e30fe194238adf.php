<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Queensland man got the shock of his life when he returned home from a night out to discover two snakes weighing about 18kg had crashed through his ceiling. </p>

<p>David Tait found the huge coastal pythons in his Lacey's Creek home, north-west of Brisbane, on Monday after walking inside to find part of the fibro ceiling in his dining room had crashed to the floor.</p>

<p>Mr Tait went searching through his home and found the 2.5m and 2.8m snakes, one in his bedroom and the other in the living area. </p>

<p>Steven Brown, 38, from Brisbane North Snake Catchers and Relocation, told Daily Mail Australia they were 'some of the fattest snakes' he had ever seen. </p>

<p>Queensland man David Tait returned home on Monday to discover two massive coastal pythons had crashed through his ceiling (pictured)</p>

<p>Steven Brown from Brisbane North Snake Catchers and Relocation said they were 'some of the fattest snakes' he had ever seen</p>

<p>Mr Brown said the snakes - weighing about 10kg and 8kg - may have been fighting over a female and there was a chance she was still close by. </p>

<p>'I did try looking for the potential female but there was no way I could get into the roof - it was impossible to get my arm in there. The home used to be the old Lacey Creek State School,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Brown, who has been into snakes for the past 10 years and owned his own business for three, added it had been a busy start to snake season, which usually kicks off on September 1.</p>

<p>Mr Brown (pictured) said the snakes - weighing about 10kg and 8kg - may have been fighting over a female and there was a chance she was still close by</p>

<p>'It actually picked up about a month ago,' he said.</p>

<p>'Normally snake and breeding season starts on the first of Spring and I don't get many calls until a couple of weeks into it ... but this season has started early and it's been busy.</p>

<p>'I think that's because of the warm winter we had ... we didn't get that cold we usually do.'  </p>

<p>David Tait found the huge coastal pythons in his Lacey's Creek home, north-west of Brisbane , on Monday after walking inside to find part of the fibro ceiling in his dining room had crashed to the floor (pictured)</p>

<p>One of the snakes was located in the bedroom of the Queensland home (pictured), which used to be the 'old Lacey Creek State School'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mr Tait said he occasionally sees snakes on his metal roof enjoying the sun.</p>

<p>'We have a lot of bush around here so you do see snakes,' he told The Courier Mail.  </p>

<p>'When I came back this morning there was a large slab (of ceiling) on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>'I guessed what had happened and went looking. I found one snake in the bedroom and we found one in the lounge room.'</p>

<p>Mr Brown said with spring just around the corner the incident was a timely reminder to be aware of snakes as breeding season begins. </p>

<p>Social media users were shocked by the pictures. </p>

<p>'Must be some good rats or possums on the menu there,' one user wrote. </p>

<p>'Omg this is my fear. How heavy would these snakes be? And how can you keep them out of the roof?' another added. </p>

<p>'They are gorgeous! They just need to brush up on their hide and seek skills a bit,' a third user joked.  </p>

<p>Mr Brown safely relocated the snakes and said they may have been fighting over a female and there was a chance she was still close by</p>
