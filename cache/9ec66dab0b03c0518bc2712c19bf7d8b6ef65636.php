<p>Palvin explained by saying she wasn't in the right place for a relationship at that time.</p>

<p>'I'm with my girlfriend, Barbara, and we're out in New York City, out here in the epicenter of the virus, but we're remaining completely indoors as much as humanly possible.' </p>

<p>The star continued, 'In a way, despite the circumstances, it's actually pretty nice considering that we fly around all the time throughout the world and haven't had this much time to spend with each other in a long time.'</p>

<p>Professionally, Sprouse is keeping busy. He currently has three projects - the films After We Collided, Turandot, and Tyger Tyger - in post-production.  </p>
