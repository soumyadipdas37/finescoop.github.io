<p>Strong: She added about the way things were edited: 'And do you know what, I'm thinking, maybe I wasn't emotional enough'</p>

<p>She also called the 31-year-old former Australian Survivor star a 'cheeky bugger' after watching the show air on TV.</p>

<p>'I was never aware of his connections with others,' Bec said, adding that she wasn't 'surprised' she got the flick after seeing how close he was to Irena and Bella.</p>

<p>She added: 'I watched it back and thought, "You cheeky bugger." You can see he has really strong feelings for the others.'</p>

<p>Despite also having a strong connection with Locky, Bec had no intention of telling him she loved him like the others did, because her feelings weren't that developed. </p>

<p>The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>

<p>Blindsided? It comes after Bec told The Courier Mail that she never realised that Locky had such strong 'connections' with finalists Bella and Irena</p>
