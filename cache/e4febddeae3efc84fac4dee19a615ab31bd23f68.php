<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Just one in 1,000 people sticks to all nine official healthy eating guidelines, a major study found.</p>

<p>Experts compared the diets of more than half a million Britons with the recommendations in Public Health England's Eatwell Guide.</p>

<p>Fewer than one third of us meet at least five of the suggestions. And just over four in ten manage between three and four.</p>

<p>Worryingly, a minuscule number consistently follow all nine of the tips, which include eating less than 70g of red meat a day and slashing sugary food intake.</p>

<p>This is despite new evidence showing it could add years to your life.</p>

<p>Some of the guidelines in particular are ignored, with fewer than one in ten people consuming enough fibre.</p>

<p>Experts compared the diets of more than half a million Britons with the recommendations in Public Health England's Eatwell Guide</p>

<p>The study found those who stuck to five or more of the nine recommendations were seven per cent less likely to die than those who followed two or fewer.</p>

<p>Eating five a day was enough to reduce the risk of dying early by ten per cent, the research by the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and the University of Oxford found.</p>

<p>Currently just 29 per cent of adults and 18 per cent of children meet the daily fruit and vegetable portion recommendation.</p>

<p>The study is the latest evidence of how poor diets are fuelling the obesity crisis.</p>

<p>It also highlights how healthy diets are important in preventing climate change by cutting emissions. Following at least five of the guidelines can reduce greenhouse gases by 30 per cent.</p>

<p>The research will raise further questions about the effectiveness of Public Health England, which is being scrapped after it was blamed for a series of coronavirus fiascos. </p>

<p>Professor Alan Dangour, the study's author, said: 'We urge the Government to develop a stronger joined-up approach to tackle the impending health and environmental crises.'</p>

<p>Professor Andrew Salter, from the University of Nottingham, added: 'Perhaps one of the most remarkable findings is the low level of adherence to the guidelines currently in the UK.' </p>

<p>Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: 'The challenge remains to help more people follow this advice.'</p>
