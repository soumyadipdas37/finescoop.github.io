<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Police are cracking down on gun violence as gang wars escalate after 28 shootings in just one month. </p>

<p>There were shootings across regional New South Wales and metropolitan Sydney in August and another two in September. </p>

<p>Police believe at least two of the shootings relate to outlaw motorcycle gang conflicts and most are believed to be targeted. </p>

<p>One of the attacks left infamous former Comanchero bikie Fares Abounader dead outside his home in Panania on August 29.</p>

<p>Mark Shammo was shot in the legs and torso on Garrong Road in Lakemba on September 1</p>

<p>Shots were fired in a unit with three people inside on Columbine Avenue in Punchbowl on September 2</p>

<p>There have been six shootings in Western Sydney since August 26. Pictured: a police car at the scene of the shooting in St Johns Park on Tuesday night</p>

<p>Police believe Abounader, who was present during the Sydney Airport bikie brawl, was a victim of a targeted shooting amid tension between the Comancheros and Bandidos. </p>

<p>Acting Assistant Commissioner Peter McKenna said NSW Police were ramping up their resources after the mass amounts of shootings.   </p>

<p>'It is not acceptable under any circumstances.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter who is involved in these shootings - it's not acceptable and we will come down on them,' Mr McKenna told reporters on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Ten of the August shootings took place across regional NSW while the 18 other attacks occurred in Sydney.   </p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner Stuart Smith said the shootings were a result of individual conflicts.</p>

<p>He explained they could relate to low-level drug dealing, which has been made more difficult because of border closures.</p>

<p>Mohamed Saab (pictured) was found with gunshot wounds to his shoulder, ribs and leg outside a home in Turrella</p>

<p>'We have seen COVID-19 putting some pressure in terms of the ability of organised crime to move illicit prohibited drugs into the state,' Mr Smith told reporters.</p>

<p>'There is some indication it's reflecting a higher than average price for drugs which is possible that some of this low-level stuff is a conflict occurring around the payment of drugs.'</p>

<p>Mr Smith said it was 'unacceptable' and 'dangerous' to other members of the public, warning the punishment could be life in prison.</p>

<p>'These people are taking a significant risk that they will spend a lifetime behind bars,' he said.</p>

<p>So far eight shootings have resulted in nine people being charged. </p>
