<p>Last week, McDonald's announced they would be adding a triple cheeseburger to their permanent menu too. </p>

<p>The 588 calorie treat, which starts at £2.19,  contains three beef patties made from British and Irish beef.   </p>

<p>Ardent fast food fans will remember the Cadbury McFlurry on the McDonald's menu before, but this is the first time they are making an appearance since April 2019. </p>

<p>'To add a lighter bite to breakfast, the Jam Muffin will be available for 99p. The toasted muffin with jam has been on sale in Ireland for a number of years and will now be coming to the UK,' McDonald's said in a statement.</p>

<p>'Also returning to the menu tomorrow are promotional McFlurry flavours – in both regular and mini sizes, the Cadbury Dairy Milk and Cadbury Caramel – both firm favourites among McFlurry fans.'</p>

<p>The toasted jam muffin, which will be part of the breakfast menu served before 11am, is 211 calories while both the McFlurries are 342 calories each. </p>

<p>The treats are available in McDonald's stores nationwide from today following a successful trial period of the Triple Cheeseburger in 60 Yorkshire restaurants earlier this year.</p>

<p>McDonald's fans in Yorkshire were amongst the first to sample the Triple Cheeseburger back in February when it was trialled across 60 restaurants</p>

<p>It is made of three patties made from 100 per cent British and Irish beef with onions, pickles, mustard and cheese, all in a soft toasted bun. </p>

<p>Fans immediately took to social media in their droves to declare their love for the new menu option.</p>

<p>'Best burger ever,' said one.</p>

<p>'GAME CHANGER!' added another. </p>

<p>While third said: 'I am ordering three, in advance, sorry to the guy on the grill,' </p>

<p>McDonald's told FEMAIL to stay in line with Government guidance, social distancing and safety measures at restaurants remain in place. </p>

<p>This includes hand sanitiser at every entrance for delivery couriers and dine-in and takeaway customers, table-service and contact tracing for customers who dine-in, and carefully managing the number of customers and crew inside each restaurant. </p>
