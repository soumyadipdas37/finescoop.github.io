<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona will reportedly move to bring in Arsenal right back Hector Bellerin on loan this summer.</p>

<p>The LaLiga giants are willing to offload Nelson Semedo, their only specialist in that position, this summer and have turned their attentions to Bellerin as a potential replacement.</p>

<p>Marca have claimed that, due to financial troubles, Barcelona would prefer to seal a temporary switch rather than stump up a sizeable fee.</p>

<p>Barcelona may move to sign dynamic Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin on loan this summer</p>

<p>The arrival of Ronald Koeman as the club's new head coach has triggered the start of a first-team overhaul, with younger players now favoured and members of the older guard shifted to the sidelines.</p>

<p>But Barcelona's transfer business has been heavily restricted due to their monetary woes - meaning they are likely to attempt to piece together a deal which is initially a season-long loan.</p>

<p>Sportsmail has previously reported Arsenal recognise that any substantial fee for Bellerin will allow them to further reinvest in the current window. </p>

<p>Arsenal are understood to recognise a large transfer fee would allow them to further reinvest </p>

<p>This stance means the club are unlikely to be interested, with figures keen to collect a significant sum in return.</p>

<p>Any rejected loan approach could see Barcelona return and attempt to fund a direct transfer, although they are understood to be unlikely to be able to spend over €25million (£23m).</p>

<p>Bellerin, whose contract in north London is set to run down in 2023, left Barcelona as a youngster in 2011 to join Arsenal.  </p>

<p>He has since featured in 205 appearances across all competitions for the club, and may be convinced into taking up a new challenge.</p>

<p>Bellerin joined Arsenal in 2011 from Barcelona's youth system and has made 205 appearances</p>

<p>Paris Saint-Germain submitted a £30m offer for the dynamic full back earlier this summer. </p>

<p>The Champions League finalists have weighed up moving for him for a number of seasons, and their initial offer was worth £25m with a further £5m in add-ons.</p>

<p>It is understood talks are expected to continue with Arsenal determined to hold out for a larger figure.</p>
