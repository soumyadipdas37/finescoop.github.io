<p>A Coles shopper claimed he found a piece of glass inside of his lamb, feta and rosemary sausages</p>

<p>The Melbourne man purchased the snags for a sausage sizzle with his wife when he made the horrifying discovery (stock image)</p>

<p>'I then took a second bite and found a chunk of glass,' he claimed on the supermarket's Facebook page on Sunday.</p>

<p>He began to fear he had already swallowed a piece of glass.</p>

<p>The man said he reported it to Coles immediately, but he felt staff didn't take his concerns seriously. </p>

<p>He claimed they took days to respond to him.  </p>

<p>'I received a template email full of marketing rubbish claiming that their quality control was second to none. I was left feeling that they didn’t even believe me,' the man complained.</p>

<p>'After days of worry that I had swallowed glass and some surface damage to my teeth, all they offered was a refund. </p>

<p>'I find their customer service appalling.' </p>

<p>The man said he reported it to Coles immediately, but he felt as thought staff didn't take his concerns seriously</p>

<p>A Coles spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia that the supermarket take the quality of their products seriously. </p>

<p>'We have spoken to the customer and Coles is investigating the matter,' the spokeswoman said.</p>

<p>'As always we encourage customers to return any item they’re not 100 per cent happy with to their nearest store for a full refund or replacement.'</p>
