<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen has signed an agreement to purchase the New York Mets from longtime owners Fred and Jeff Wilpon for a reported $2.4 billion after outbidding local power couple, Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez.</p>

<p>MLB Network's Jon Heyman was the first to report the sale, which, according to Joel Sherman of the New York Post, is a record for a North American sports franchise.</p>

<p>'I am excited to have reached an agreement with the Wilpon and Katz families to purchase the New York Mets,' Cohen said in a team statement after reaching an agreement with the team's respective majority and minority owners.</p>

<p>Cohen had long been considered the favorite to buy the team, given his immense wealth, believed to be over $14 billion, according to Forbes. But, after submitting a $2.6 billion bid in late 2019, according to multiple reports, the Long Island native reduced his offer to $2 billion amid disagreements with the Wilpons over Jeff's future role with the team.</p>

<p>Rodriguez and Lopez added several high-profile investors to their group's reported $2 billion offer, but were unable to eclipse the bid put forth by Cohen.</p>
