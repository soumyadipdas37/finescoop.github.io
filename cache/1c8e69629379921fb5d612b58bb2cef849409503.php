<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dixons Carphone saw sales of electrical items purchased online triple at the peak of lockdown, its latest update reveals.</p>

<p>Even after the company reopened its stores, online sales have remained over twice as high than at the same point a year ago.</p>

<p>But, with many people still working from home and travelling less, the group's travel hub stores, many of which remain closed, have seen their sales slashed 90 per cent on a year ago.</p>

<p>In August, the Currys PC World owner announced plans to cut 800 store management jobs in a bid to create a 'flatter management structure' as it adapts to surging online sales. </p>

<p>Booming online sales: Dixons Carphone saw sales of electrical items purchased online triple at the peak of lockdown</p>

<p>The business said that despite what looks like strong trading at the moment, it is 'uncertain' over its outlook for the year. </p>

<p>Chief executive Alex Baldock said: 'Online has continued to power ahead: in the UK &amp; Ireland alone we grew online sales by more than £500million in four months, growth that stayed strong even as stores reopened.'</p>

<p>The company reported a 12 per cent rise in electricals sales in the UK and Ireland in the 17 weeks to the end of August. </p>

<p>In the Nordics, online sales rose by 49 per cent, while they increased by 115 per cent in Greece. Stores were open throughout the period in both locations. </p>

<p>In total, international like-for-like revenue grew 16 per cent over the period. </p>

<p>But rises in one area were largely offset by falls in others, as shop sales plummeted during lockdown. </p>

<p>Dixons Carphone's mobile division suffered a 56 per cent drop in revenue over the period.</p>

<p>The group has been struggling with its loss-making mobile arm amid dwindling demand for new phones.</p>

<p>Earlier this year Dixons Carphone announced plans to close all its standalone Carphone Warehouse stores in face of poor demand.'</p>

<p>The company said it was in the 'early stages' of considering a stock market listing for its Nordics arm. </p>

<p>Dixons Carphone said: 'This would shine a light on the value of the Nordics business whilst retaining it as part of the group.' </p>

<p>FTSE 250-listed Dixons Carphone saw its share price jump sharply this morning. At present, the share price is up 3.97 per cent or 3.25p to 85.15p. </p>

<p>Mixed fortunes: Online sales at Dixons Carphone have increased but travel hub store sales are down 90% on last year</p>
