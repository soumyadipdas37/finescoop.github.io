<p>Steve Bruce and the board at St James' Park are keen to strengthen the first-team squad, and the Brazilian would fill a gaping hole in defence. </p>

<p>Danny Rose, who was on loan at Newcastle for the second-half of last season, has returned to parent club Tottenham and as such, the Magpies are set to sign Rogerio, according to The Sun. </p>

<p>Sassuolo left back Rogerio (right) is on the verge of joining Newcastle United for £12.5million</p>

<p>Newcastle boss Steve Bruce is looking to strengthen his defence during the summer window</p>

<p>Any deal for the 22-year-old would be Newcastle's first financial outlay of the summer.</p>

<p>Steve Bruce has already signed Republic of Ireland international Jeff Hendrick on a free transfer from Burnley last month, and goalkeeper Mark Gillespie on a free from Motherwell. </p>

<p>Rogerio has spent most of his professional career in Italy, having come through the youth system at Serie A champions Juventus. </p>

<p>Having been on loan at Sassuolo for two years, he joined the Serie A side permanently last summer. </p>

<p>Newcastle are also interested in a season-long-loan deal for Arsenal's Rob Holding (left)</p>

<p>The left back has made 61 league appearances for the club, scoring two goals and recording two assists. </p>

<p>Bruce is also reportedly looking to strengthen his back-line with a move for Arsenal centre half Rob Holding. </p>

<p>Newcastle are currently exploring the possibility of taking Holding on loan from the Emirates, with the 24-year-old's chances of first-team football at the Emirates taking a blow this week following the £27m signing of Gabriel Magalhaes from Lille.   </p>
