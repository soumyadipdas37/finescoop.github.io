<p>Human rights activist Bianca Jagger has hit out at Extinction Rebellion for blockading printworks to stop the publication of national newspapers.  </p>

<p>Ms Jagger, the former wife of Rolling Stones rockstar Sir Mick, voiced her commitment to always engage in debates with those who have differing opinions, saying she believes freedom of speech to be 'sacrosanct'.  </p>

<p>Her comments come after Extinction Rebellion's 'guerrilla tactics' printing press blockade left some newsagents' shelves empty on Saturday morning. </p>

<p>More than 100 protesters targeted Newsprinters printing works at Broxbourne, as well as at Knowsley, near Liverpool, blocking the Sun, Times, Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph from leaving the depots. </p>

<p>Now Ms Jagger, from Nicaragua, has spoken in a stark warning of the horrors of attacks on freedom of speech. </p>

<p>The former actress, writing in the Telegraph, says that she is happy to have articles published in that paper, along with the Daily Mail and Financial Times, because their readership is an audience she wants to read and persuade of the climate change threat through reason.  </p>

<p>'That is why I was very surprised by the decision of Extinction Rebellion to blockade the printing sites for The Sun, The Times, the Daily Mail, the Telegraph and The Evening Standard,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Ms Jagger went on: 'I think Extinction Rebellion's actions were a mistake. I hope they will realise that it was the wrong move, and not the most productive action that they could have taken.</p>

<p>'We need to protect freedom of speech. Yes, we can and should challenge the media when they are not being fair and not reporting accurately but we cannot shut them down. That is not how you gain respect and popularity.'</p>

<p>She added that we must find common ground for democracy to function properly, and we must never forget author Lailah Gifty Akita's words: 'A man can be converted when convinced.'</p>

<p>On Saturday, following Extinction Rebellion's blockade, the Society of Editors issued a statement by executive director Ian Murray which condemned the blocking of the presses.</p>

<p>Extinction Rebellion environmental activist group (in the picture) maintain the blockade throughout the night using vehicles and bamboo lock-ons to try to prevent the Sun, Times, Telegraph and Mail newspapers from reaching newsstands on Saturday </p>

<p>In the statement Murray said: 'The irony of protesters who wish to have their voices heard and their message listened to attempting to silence others by preventing the distribution of newspapers would be laughable if it was not so serious,' commented Murray.</p>

<p>'You have to wonder whether those planning and taking part in these foolish actions understand anything from history; that controlling or shutting down free speech and an independent media is the first action of totalitarian regimes and dictators.</p>

<p>'Everyone has the right to peacefully protest and make their voices heard, after all that is what a free press is all about. But it is not acceptable for those who wish only their voices to be heard to attempt to silence others.</p>

<p>'The UK's media has provided an enormous amount of coverage on the issue of climate change, exploring the arguments from all angles. </p>

<p>'This attempt to blackmail the media into slavishly repeating the claims of one side of the debate while ignoring criticism of it will fail but displays a poor understanding of how the freedoms that allow organisations like Extinction Rebellion to protest are protected through the very free press they are attacking.'  </p>
