<p>In October 2019, Katie also claimed it has been 13 years since Dwight had seen Harvey, and in an emotional video two months later, she pleaded for the former footballer to see his son.</p>

<p>When asked if Dwight had been in touch for his son's birthday, she said: 'No, it's like he has no feelings for Harvey whatsoever.</p>

<p>Family: Katie is also a mother to daughters Princess, 13, Bunny, six, and sons Jett, seven and Junior, 15  (Katie pictured with all five of her children)</p>

<p>'The only thing that upsets me is that Harvey has a half-brother out there and he's never met him.'</p>

<p>She added that it was 'never too late' and that the door was 'always open' for Dwight to come back into his son's life. </p>

<p>Katie is also mother to son Junior, 15, and daughter Princess, 13, with ex-husband Peter Andre and son Jett, seven, and daughter Bunny, six, with estranged husband Kieran Hayler. </p>
