<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has been rushed to hospital after she bit into a strawberry which allegedly contained a needle - marking the second reported sabotage case in a week. </p>

<p>Erin Gelken was forced to go for tetanus injections and blood tests after she pricked her tongue on a strawberry she bought at Aldi in Port Pirie, South Australia.</p>

<p>Ms Gelken and her partner Mitchell Thomas were 'shaken up' following the alleged contamination, Nine News reported.</p>

<p>South Australian couple Erin Gelken and Mitchell Thomas were 'shaken up' following the alleged strawberry contamination</p>

<p>This is the second time South Australian shoppers have allegedly found needles in their strawberries this week. </p>

<p>Mr Thomas said Ms Gelken bit the first one and was 'fine' but was pierced after she attempted to eat a second strawberry.</p>

<p>'It's absolutely abhorrent, it's not good for the industry, these are industry killers,' Mr Thomas said.</p>

<p>The couple said they have reported the incident to Queensland Health and the police, with the latter seizing the strawberries and needle as evidence. </p>

<p>They bought the strawberries on Tuesday.   </p>

<p>The other alleged case of sabotage occurred after Anne Lentakis purchased a punnet of Berry Indulgence from a Foodland in Stirling, Adelaide Hills, on Thursday. </p>

<p>Ms Gelken was forced to go for tetanus injections and blood tests after she pricked her tongue on a strawberry she bought at Aldi in Port Pirie, South Australia</p>

<p>Mr Thomas said Ms Gelken bit the first one and was 'fine' but was pierced after she attempted to eat a second strawberry. 'It's absolutely abhorrent, it's not good for the industry, these are industry killers,' Mr Thomas said</p>

<p>Ms Lentakis told ABC Radio she and her 11-year-old son had been cutting the fruit for an afternoon snack when they came across the contaminated strawberry.</p>

<p>'He cut one strawberry and found a pin deep inside the strawberry,' she said.</p>

<p>'He said to me, "Mum, I think there's a pin in my strawberry".'</p>

<p>The distraught mother said her eight-year-old son later found another needle planted in a different strawberry.</p>

<p>Ms Lentakis has since notified the fruit and vegetable store of the find and it has pulled the Berry Indulgence brand from its shelves. </p>

<p>'I think there have been things put in place since this happened before with metal scanning, so that was a bit confusing to wonder how and why this could happen but [he was] very appreciative that I had called him,' she said.</p>

<p>'He had jumped on the phone and activated their procedures.'</p>

<p>South Australia police are reportedly investigating the incident.</p>

<p>Ms Lentakis told ABC Radio she and her 11-year-old son had been cutting the fruit for an afternoon snack when they came across the contaminated strawberry</p>

<p>A national health crisis was sparked in September 2018 when sewing needles were discovered inside strawberries on sale at major supermarkets.</p>

<p>The contamination scare saw supermarkets pull punnets from their shelves and farmers dump the fruit by the truckload. </p>

<p>Some consumers were reluctant to purchase strawberries and the decline in demand had a significant impact on producers.</p>

<p>The estimated farm gate value of Queensland strawberries had declined by 8 per cent for 2018 to 2019, worth around $12million.  </p>
