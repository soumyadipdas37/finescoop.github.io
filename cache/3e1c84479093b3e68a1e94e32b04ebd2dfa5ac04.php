<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victorians will still enjoy a public holiday to celebrate the AFL Grand Final, even though the decider has been moved to Brisbane due to the threat of COVID-19.</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews said Victorians have 'earned' the day off after months of restrictive lockdown orders to stem the spread of the deadly respiratory infection.</p>

<p>The Gabba in Brisbane was awarded AFL's showpiece event over Perth's Optus Stadium and the Adelaide Oval on Wednesday.</p>

<p>After landing in the Sunshine State, AFL CEO Gil McLachlan confirmed the 2020 Grand Final will be held at the Gabba on October 24, saying the state's presentation was 'world class'.</p>

<p>And while Queenslanders are celebrating scoring the Grand Final, which is scheduled for Saturday October 24, it doesn't look like the state will be getting a public holiday on the eve of the game.</p>

<p>The unprecedented move is already making waves among fans of the game, many of whom would be looking to secure a ticket to celebrate the first time in the illustrious 124 year history that the game has abandoned the MCG.</p>

<p>Early indications suggest securing a ticket won't be easy.</p>

<p>The MCG, where the game is usually held, sits 100,000 people, while the Gabba can comfortably sit just 30,000 - instantly shaving some 70,000 tickets off the event.</p>

<p>When factoring in social distancing restrictions and gathering limits - depending on the status of the COVID crisis at the time of the game - tickets could be sparse.</p>

<p>In 2019, an adult ticket cost anywhere between $155 and $422.</p>

<p>On average, ticket prices trend upwards every year, which means Queenslanders can expect to be out of pocket at least $160 for a seat in the arena. </p>

<p>Given the limited number of tickets to go around, officials are considering offering them to members first.</p>

<p>'If Brisbane makes the grand final, then good luck getting a ticket for the Brisbane members,' AFL Fixtures boss Travis Auld said.</p>

<p>'We'll have to see who makes the grand final and allocate tickets with the membership base in the state.'</p>

<p>For the first time in Grand Final history, the game will be played of a night, rather than the 2.30pm slot. </p>

<p>The game is penciled in for a 7pm kick off.  </p>

<p>AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan said changing the start time of the game would contribute to 'making it a truly unique event'. </p>

<p>In addition to securing the AFL Grand Final, Ms Palaszczuk has her sights set on the game's most glitzy event, the Brownlow Medals</p>

<p>All ten Victoria-based clubs escaped the state in July before the border with NSW shut (Dustin Martin of the Tigers and Mabior Chol of the Tigers board a charter flight on July 6)</p>

<p>Motorists are stopped at a checkpoint at Coolangatta on the Queensland- New South Wales border earlier this month</p>

<p>Mr McLachlan said he would consider changing future grand finals to night games if the change was well received.  </p>

<p>In addition to securing the AFL Grand Final, Ms Palaszczuk has her sights set on the game's most glitzy event, the Brownlow Medals.</p>

<p>There haven't been any firm discussions about the venue for the awards night yet because officials are still discussing which 'format' it should be held in.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the event will be held in person, but there have been whispers that the Gold Coast, just south of Brisbane, is the frontrunner for securing the show.</p>

<p>'We just need to think about how we do that,' Mr Auld said.</p>

<p>'We need to work out whether we run it as an event with people attending, and we'll work closely with the Queensland Government again on how that might occur.'</p>

<p>AFL CEO Mr McLachlan made the announcement from a quarantine hotel in Queensland</p>

<p>But the huge influx of AFL officials, players and WAGS gave rise to claims of double standards, given the pain the state's draconian border restrictions are inflicting upon average people.</p>

<p>Campbell Newman, the state's former LNP premier, tweeted: 'So if you are AFL royalty you can get into Queensland, with your family, but if you live in northern NSW with your seriously ill child you can't!</p>

<p>'Nothing demonstrates more starkly the politically cynical and elitist reality of Annastacia (Palaszczuk) and Dr Young's restrictions.'</p>

<p>The AFL officials will still need to undergo the mandatory two week hotel-quarantine after flying into the state.</p>

<p>Victoria: Completely open, but other states are banning residents from going there</p>

<p>NSW: Border with Victoria is closed but others are open without restriction</p>

<p>Queensland: Open to everywhere but Victoria, NSW, and the ACT</p>

<p>Northern Territory: Open to everywhere but Victoria and Sydney, which must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>South Australia: Closed to Victoria, NSW arrivals must self-isolate, rest are open</p>

<p>Tasmania: Closed to Victoria, everywhere else must do hotel quarantine</p>

<p>Western Australia: Closed to everywhere without an exemption </p>

<p>Just two new COVID-19 cases were recorded in Queensland in the 24 hours to 9am on Wednesday, with the number of active cases in an existing cluster remaining at 28. </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk today brushed off the criticisms.</p>

<p>She said winning the rights to host the grand final were an endorsement of her government's response to COVID-19.</p>

<p>'This is a historic day - it's a historic day for the AFL, it's a historic day for Queensland,' she said.</p>

<p>'I do want to pay a special shoutout to all Queenslanders, who have done a great job especially as we've battled COVID as well.</p>

<p>'If it wasn't for that strong health response and the fact that every Queenslander has been part of that this would not have happened, so this is a win for Queensland as well.'</p>

<p>Quizzed about the healthcare border issue , Ms Palaszczuk said NSW residents requiring specialist treatment would have a streamlined process to apply for medical exemptions by the end of the week.</p>

<p>Under the rules, NSW emergency patients are allowed to enter Queensland.</p>

<p>Mr McLachlan's own press conference announcing the move was livestreamed from a hotel where he will serve out his quarantine period.</p>
