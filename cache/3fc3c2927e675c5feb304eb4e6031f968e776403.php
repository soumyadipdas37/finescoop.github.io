<p>The Big Bang Theory star revealed last month on Instagram that she was returning to work on her new show.</p>

<p>She said in a video: 'The first update would be that I am going back to work! So my sister, me and my trusty assistant Emma go back to New York on Monday. And we have to quarantine – I'm sure you'll see a lot of stuff on social media about our quarantine.</p>

<p>'We'll be quarantined for two weeks and you'll get a look at our shenanigans, I'm sure. And then back to work. We only have like two and a half episodes left, so I'm going to wrap up by the beginning of October.'</p>

<p>The show, which is expected to premiere in November, is based on the 2018 novel of the same name by Chris Bohjalian.</p>

<p>Kaley continued: 'I don't have an exact date but that is exciting at all in itself. I don't know if you guys know this but I have been working on this project for three years. </p>

<p>'It goes back to three years from when I actually found the original book, so it's very exciting for me, and then obviously developing it for over two years.'</p>
