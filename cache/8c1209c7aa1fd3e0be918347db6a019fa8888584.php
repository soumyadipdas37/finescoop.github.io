<p>And on Sunday Hilary Duff kept up with that COVID-19 lockdown mantra by heading out on a hike with husband Matthew Koma, their daughter Banks, and son Luca from her first marriage to former NHL player Mike Comrie.</p>

<p>Looking to step up her workout, Duff pulled double duty during the outing in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles by hauling her nearly two-year-old daughter with a baby carrier that was secured on her back and shoulders.</p>

<p>Quality family time: Hilary Duff played double duty when she hauled daughter Banks in a baby carrier during a hike with her son Luca and husband Matthew Koma in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles on Sunday</p>

<p>Despite the extra weight on her back, the Lizzie McGuire star kept pace with her family dressed in black leggings and a white sleeveless t-shirt.</p>

<p>She also donned grey sneakers and wore a black baseball cap over her long blonde tresses that flowed to the middle of her back.  </p>

<p>Koma, a singer-songwriter who fronts the band Winnetka Bowling League, wore black shorts over grey tights with a military-green tank top and grey sneakers.</p>

<p>He also donned a red baseball cap and carried a pink backpack over his shoulders, which stored any go-to child needs, along with water and snacks.</p>

<p>Carrying on! Hilary showed her strength as she goes hiking with her kids</p>

<p>Luca, eight, went with black shorts, a red shirt, a white and blue baseball cap and sneakers.</p>

<p>His adorable sister, 23 months, had on pink-patterned tights with a white shirt and her blonde hair pulled into a cute top ponytail.</p>

<p>All four of them wore protective masks when ever appropriate, but at times, when they weren't in the vicinity of any other hikers, they pulled them down off their faces.       </p>

<p>Multi-tasking: Hilary had her hands full for the day out</p>

<p>At one point, during an incline in their hike, Duff appeared to struggle with having  her little girl on her back and needed to take a quick break.         </p>

<p>Duff and Koma have been in a relationship since January 2017, which eventually led to them getting married in December 2019. </p>

<p>The singer and actress had been married to Comrie for nearly five years when she filed for divorce in February 2015.</p>

<p>Looming birthday: Duff and Koma's daughter will turn two in October</p>
