<p>She responded: 'I mean I have loved that show since I was 9 years old, I’ve been watching every single season. I just think that it’s genuinely the best reality show and I guess I just have to restart it and watch it again....</p>

<p>'But I’m very sad to know that that’s what’s going on. My older sister is devastated but I’m obviously sad, it’s horrible, they are an iconic family that you love to watch and they say the funniest things, so I’m definitely going to miss them'. </p>

<p>Roman said: 'A lot of people will…well listen the relationship you seemingly have with your brother, I mean what’s the chance of you getting your own reality show?' </p>

<p>She replied: 'Everyone says this but we cannot have our own reality show [laughs]. We just can’t, I mean we’re just all very crazy and very loud and I don’t think any crew member would ever want to be in our house'.</p>
