<p>The actor had previously revealed he had tested positive and that he'd somehow caught the deadly virus in transit from Los Angeles to Australia.</p>

<p>Healthy: The actor explained the doctors told him on Thursday his result was actually a 'false positive'</p>

<p>Back home: Hugh had jetted into Australia from Los Angeles in mid-August, and at the time was forced to undergo a mandatory 14-day stint at a quarantine hotel</p>

<p>'I had a negative result when I arrived [in Australia]. I now know all my friends including [those] who took me to LAX airport are all negative so it's been confusing for me. It's scary, frustrating and lonely,' he said. </p>

<p>'I am SO LUCKY &amp; I keep reminding myself to count each blessing 1 by 1. To everyone: this virus is seriously clever. Knowing now that no one I saw back home overseas has it means I got it in a very short space of time (in transit or a surface) while I had minimal human contact,' he wrote.  </p>

<p>At the time he admitted his mental health had suffered as a result of the diagnosis.  </p>
