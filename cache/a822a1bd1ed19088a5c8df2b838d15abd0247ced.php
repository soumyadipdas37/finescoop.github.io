<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The future of Daniel Andrews' right-hand man hangs in the balance after an inquiry into Victoria's hotel quarantine program was urged to find he failed to tell the premier crucial information about the regime that sparked the second wave. </p>

<p>Legal counsel for the inquiry submitted their recommendations on Monday - urging it to find Mr Andrews was not kept sufficiently informed of issues with the program.</p>

<p>In one of a series of recommendations, the counsel said Department of Premier and Cabinet secretary Chris Eccles should have told Mr Andrews the federal government had offered Australian Defence Force support in an April 8 email exchange.  </p>

<p>But lawyer Rachel Ellyard said the decision to use private security to contain COVID-19 was not made by one person or state government department.  </p>

<p>Recently arrived overseas travellers arrive at the Crown Promenade Hotel in Melbourne on March 29. Lawyers have said the decision to use private security to contain COVID-19 was not made by one person or department</p>

<p>'The question is "who decided private security officers needed to be engaged and they would be playing the role they played",' she said.</p>

<p>'That question is astonishingly still unable to be answered it would seem.'</p>

<p>Instead, she said the decision was a 'creeping assumption that became a reality'. </p>

<p>The inquiry heard the fateful decision to use guards was likely made at a meeting at the state control centre on the afternoon of March 27.  </p>

<p>'While no one person made a decision, by the end of that state control centre meeting, it was understood by all present that that was what was going to happen,' Ms Ellyard said.</p>

<p>In that meeting, Victoria Police Assistant Commissioner Mick Grainger said it was the force's 'preference' private security be used.</p>

<p>'The expression of a preference can readily be understood to have given the clear impression that police weren't going to do it and there needed to be an alternative,' Ms Ellyard said.</p>

<p>'Their preference became the outcome.'</p>

<p>She said once the decision had been made, no one in the meeting gave 'any specific consideration' to the suitability of private security for the job. </p>

<p>The legal advice said in total three departmental secretaries did not adequately brief ministers about changes in the program.</p>

<p>Department of Premier and Cabinet secretary Chris Eccles pictured facing the inquiry in Melbourne. His future hangs in the balance after an inquiry criticised a lack of communication between departmental secretaries and Premier Daniel Andrews during the state's hotel quarantine program</p>

<p>As well as Mr Eccles, uncertainty also now hangs over Department of Jobs secretary Simon Phemister and Department of Health and Human Services secretary Kym Peake. </p>

<p>Victoria's second wave of coronavirus can be traced back to outbreaks among security guards and staff at the Rydges on Swanston and Stamford Plaza hotels in mid-May and June.</p>

<p>Ms Ellyard said the Department of Health and Human Services was in charge of the program but its focus was largely on 'logistics and compliance at the expense of public health'.</p>

<p>Counsel assisting Ben Ihle said the program failed to meet its primary objective, which was to keep the community safe from the virus.</p>

<p>Lawyers Tony Neal QC, Rachel Ellyard and Ben Ihle submitted their suggested findings to Victoria's hotel quarantine inquiry on Monday. They are as follows:</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT HAD NO PLAN</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Public servants were given just 36 hours to set up the program.</p></li>
<li><p>There was no suggestion those who set up the program worked other than with 'the best of intentions and to the best of their ability'.</p></li>
<li><p>'Bad faith or corruption is not what the evidence shows.'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Calls are growing for Daniel Andrews (pictured) to resign after an inquiry heard the state's hotel quarantine disaster caused 768 deaths</p>

<p>DHHS WAS IN CONTROL</p>

<ul>
<li>The Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions played a substantial role but the Department of Health and Human Services was the control agency responsible for the program.</li>
</ul>

<p>BRETT SUTTON SHOULD'VE BEEN IN CHARGE</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It was wrong to appoint people without public health expertise as the state controllers of the pandemic in February as it 'influenced the way in which DHHS subsequently understood and acted on its responsibilities'.</p></li>
<li><p>'Had the chief health officer or another person with public health expertise been appointed state controller ... they would have had direct oversight of the hotel quarantine program and been able to directly influence the model of that program.'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>NO ONE PERSON MADE THE DECISION TO USE SECURITY GUARDS</p>

<ul>
<li>'It can be best understood ... as a creeping assumption or default consensus reached in the state control centre after the preference of Victoria Police was known.'</li>
</ul>

<p>POLICE HAD PREFERENCE FOR GUARDS</p>

<ul>
<li>'It was not Victoria Police's decision, but Victoria Police's clear position that security would be preferable was a substantial contributing factor to the consensus.'</li>
</ul>

<p>PREMIER SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD ABOUT ADF OFFER</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Department of Premier and Cabinet secretary Chris Eccles should have told Premier Daniel Andrews his federal counterpart had offered Australian Defence Force support in an April 8 email exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>But the initial decision not to have ADF boots on the ground was 'reasonable and open - and no criticism should be directed to those who made those operational decisions'.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>CONTRACTS WERE INAPPROPRIATE</p>

<ul>
<li><p>'There was insufficient supervision of those contracts to ensure compliance with the contractual terms, including as to subcontracting.'</p></li>
<li><p>'The contracts with hotels and security companies should not have placed responsibility for PPE and infection control education on those contractors.'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>HOTEL QUARANTINE RESPONSIBLE FOR SECOND WAVE</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ninety per cent of second wave COVID-19 cases are attributable to the Rydges on Swanston outbreak in mid-May. Just under 10 per cent were attributable to the outbreak at the Stamford Hotel in mid-June.</p></li>
<li><p>'The hotel quarantine program in Victoria failed to achieve its primary objective. The program that was intended to contain the disease was instead a seeding ground for the spread of COVID-19 into the broader community.'</p></li>
<li><p>'The failure by the hotel quarantine program to contain this virus is, as at today's date, responsible for the deaths of 768 people and the infection of some 18,418 others.'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>PEOPLE IN QUARANTINE NOT LOOKED AFTER</p>

<ul>
<li><p>'The program did not always operate so as to meet the needs of those who were detained, in particular, those who had specific needs or vulnerabilities.'</p></li>
<li><p>'Very early on, better consideration ought to have been given to the likely psychosocial impact of detention and expert advice should have been sought.'</p></li>
<li><p>'Exemptions could and likely should have been granted in more situations.'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>LACK OF TRANSPARENCY</p>

<ul>
<li><p>'There were significant issues which should have been brought to the respective ministers' attention. The departmental secretaries were obliged to ensure that they discharged those obligations.'</p></li>
<li><p>'They likely contributed to a loss in opportunities to identify and address issues which may have prompted better, fuller and more timely action.'</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The submissions may form the recommendations of the inquiry's chair, retired judge Jennifer Coate. She is due to deliver her final report to Victorian Governor Linda Dessau by November 6.</p>

<p>Lawyer Rachel Ellyard pictured during Monday's hearing. She said there was 'astonishingly' no answer to the question of who decided to hire private security guards</p>

<p>'The program that was intended to contain the disease, was instead a seeding ground for the spread of COVID-19 into the community,' Mr Ihle said.</p>

<p>'The failure by the hotel quarantine program to contain this virus is, as at today's date, responsible for the deaths of 768 people and the infection of 18,418 others.</p>

<p>'One only needs to pause and to reflect on those figures to appreciate the full scope of devastation and despair occasioned as a result of the outbreaks.' </p>

<p>Calls meanwhile are growing for Daniel Andrews to resign.</p>

<p>Victorian Opposition leader Michael O'Brien said the quarantine operation was 'the worst failure of public administration in Victorian history'. </p>

<p>He added: 'If accountability for the deaths and damage is to mean anything, all those responsible must go - starting with Andrews.'</p>

<p>On Monday afternoon the final day of Victoria's hotel quarantine inquiry heard the program's failure was responsible for the deaths of all 768 residents who have died in the state's second wave. </p>

<p>Mr Ihle said protective gear was not used properly, staff were poorly trained and there was a lack of social distancing at the quarantine hotels. </p>

<p>He said the system was set up quickly and the government failed to monitor it.</p>

<p>'What was established was necessarily untested and prudence dictated that the program should have been accompanied by intensive ongoing monitoring and auditing,' he said.</p>

<p>'The Victorian government failed to adequately ensure that this was done.'</p>

<p>Former Health Minister Jenny Mikakos resigned on Saturday after Mr Andrews said she was 'accountable' for the quarantine program. </p>

<p>On Sunday Mr Andrews said he would not resign, telling reporters: 'I don't run from problems and challenges'. </p>

<p>Opposition leader Michael O'Brien</p>

<p>Melbourne's second wave of coronavirus was sparked in late May when the disease escaped from a quarantine hotel and rapidly spread around the city. </p>

<p>'The scientific evidence now strongly suggests, and we submit that the board can comfortably find, that 90 per cent of positive cases in Victoria since [26 May] are attributable to that initial outbreak at the Rydges in late May,' Mr Ihle said.</p>

<p>The Victorian government has been criticised for using private security guards to man the hotels instead of the police and ADF troops like in New South Wales and Queensland.</p>

<p>Contracts written up by the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions left infection control and training in personal protective equipment use to the security companies.</p>

<p>Hotels, meanwhile, were responsible for cleaning, unless a returned traveller tested positive to Covid-19.</p>

<p>'Responsibility for managing the risk of infection and providing for the safety of those involved in the program should have remained with the state. No contract should have purported to outsource those matters,' Ms Ellyard said.</p>

<p>Counsel assisting Tony Neal QC said there was no suggestion those who set up the program worked other than with 'the best of intentions and to the best of their ability'.</p>

<p>'Bad faith or corruption is not what the evidence shows,' he said.</p>

<p>'Yet it is true that the hastily assembled program failed at two locations within approximately two and a half months and with disastrous consequences.</p>

<p>'A multitude of decisions, actions and inaction, many of which compounded the effect of the other, ultimately expressed itself in the outbreaks which subverted the very reason for the existence of a hotel quarantine program. </p>
