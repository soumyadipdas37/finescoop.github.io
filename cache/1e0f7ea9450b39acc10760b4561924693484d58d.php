<p>AFL chief executive Gil McLachlan was tight-lipped when pressed for more details while boarding a plane for the Gold Coast from Melbourne.</p>

<p>'There is a recommendation to the commission that's been accepted,' McLachlan  told reporters.</p>

<p>'But there's stuff we're working through clearly today with the Victorian government and the relevant bodies and hopefully we get there.</p>

<p>'We're looking forward to completing it tonight or in the morning and making an announcement tomorrow.'</p>

<p>'Very strategic from the AFL, almost bordering on evil.' ' NRL 360 host Ben Ikin joked on the Fox Sports program Wednesday night. </p>

<p>Panellist Brent Read added: 'What do you expect from them? I'm not too worried about the AFL. How long have they been trying to take over Queensland now? And they've barely made a dent. I mean, good luck.'</p>

<p>AFL superstar Dustin Martin and his Richmond  Tigers teammates hope to claim back to back titles when the grand final is played in Brisbane for the first time</p>

<p>Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the government 'made a very comprehensive pitch.</p>

<p>'We know when the AFL first floated the idea of a hub, we welcomed that idea and worked with the Chief Health Officer to make that happen. Since then we have hosted nearly the entire AFL competition,' she said.</p>

<p> 'If Queensland is fortunate [enough to host the grand final], we know that it is just this once and it is to look after the AFL whilst Victoria is going through a very difficult time.'</p>

<p>The AFL grand final is traditionally held on the last Saturday of September in front of 100,000 fans at the MCG, which has hosting rights until at least 2057. </p>
