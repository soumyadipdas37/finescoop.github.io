<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eagle-eyed conspiracy theorists have pointed out some suspicious details on the police badge of an officer who arrested an anti-lockdown protester in her home.</p>

<p>The only problem is, their unfounded claim is completely wrong and has been brutally shut down by police.</p>

<p>Zoe Lee Buhler, 28, was arrested wearing pyjamas in front of her children in her lounge room in Ballarat, northwest of Melbourne, on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>A social media user posted a screen shot from the Facebook Live video questioning whether the arresting officer's badge was real.</p>

<p>A posted a screen shot questioning whether the arresting officer's badge (pictured) is real </p>

<p>The social media user is suspicious due to the yellow colour and 'blacked out' coat of arms </p>

<p>'What's going on here Australia? We have detective sergeant Adrian Smith with a very odd looking badge here... no coat of arms and somehow blacked out,' the conspiracy theorist posted.</p>

<p>'Blue is real. These people are ANTIFA satanists. It was set-up/staged.'  </p>

<p>But Victoria Police were quick to debunk the ill-conceived theory.</p>

<p>'It's perfectly normal looking detective ID card,' Victoria Police told news.com.au.</p>

<p>'Detectives are yellow, uniform police are blue.</p>

<p>'The silver coat of arms is reflective and will change appearance depending on the angle the light hits it.'</p>

<p>Victoria Police have pointed out that yellow badges are given to detectives while uniform police receive blue IDs</p>

<p>Police in the locked down state have been forced to deal with a surge in dangerous coronavirus conspiracy claims as residents grow restless under strict stay-at-home orders. </p>

<p>Buhler was taken into custody and charged with incitement after creating a Facebook protest event in Ballarat against Daniel Andrew's draconian lockdown in Victoria.</p>

<p>Three other protest organisers around Victoria have also been charged with incitement in the past few weeks. </p>

<p>'I was scared I was being kidnapped by people, they obviously weren't in uniforms,' she told media waiting outside her Miner's Rest home on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>'I was just so scared, I was like oh my gosh if I disappear today I want it live on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I'm only very early pregnancy so obviously you're told not to stress out or strain.'</p>

<p>Buhler is about seven weeks pregnant, only finding out days ago, and was due to have her first ultrasound an hour after her arrest.</p>

<p>Mother-of-two Buhler with her boyfriend James Timmins, who filmed her being arrested</p>

<p>She said she was 'still yet to know exactly what [incitement] means' and planned to fight the charge claiming it was an honest mistake.</p>

<p>Buhler later told 3AW radio that she felt the police 'barging in' to her home and arresting her was 'extreme' and a phone call would have sufficed.</p>

<p>'I had a bit of a bimbo moment and I actually didn't realise that it wasn't okay. I thought so long as we social distanced and wore masks it was okay,' she said.</p>

<p>'I was aware that the protest coming up in Melbourne wasn't permitted, but I thought, in Ballarat, we're in Stage Three lockdown.</p>

<p>'I'm not a criminal person... If the police had just called me and told me to remove the post I would've done so.</p>

<p>'I understand police were doing their job and they were very nice for me, but I wasn't very happy with them barging into my house in front of my children.'</p>

<p>Buhler is about seven weeks pregnant, only finding out days ago, and was due to have her first ultrasound an hour after her arrest</p>

<p>Buhler's social media pages are full of coronavirus conspiracy theories, but she insisted she believed the pandemic was real.</p>

<p>'My heart goes out to anyone who's died of covid, I know that people are getting sick, I don't believe it's a hoax or anything, I'm not a part of a cult,' she said. </p>

<p>Buhler's created a since-deleted 'Freedom Day Ballarat' event planned for 11am on Saturday on Sturt Street.</p>

<p>She was released on bail to face Ballarat Magistrates Court on January 25 next year.</p>

<p>Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia anybody thinking of 'attending the protest... can expect a swift and firm response from police. </p>

<p>'We will have no hesitation in issuing $1,652 fines to anyone who is breaching the restrictions on the day, or making arrests if necessary.'</p>
