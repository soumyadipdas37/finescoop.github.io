<p>Donna Deaves (pictured), pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced in 2013 to 12 years in jail with a non parole period of nine years</p>

<p>Deaves will be released on October 17 after completing her sentence - with the state parole authority accepting there is specialist help available for her within the community, Nine News reported. </p>

<p>She must follow 11 strict conditions including seeking psychological treatment and she will be on the child protection list.  </p>

<p>Tanilla's stepfather, Warren Ross, 37, was sentenced to 40 years jail in 2014 for the young child's murder.  </p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Sally Dowling SC reminded the court at the time of the terrifying conditions Tanilla endured before her murder, arguing that torture was the only way to described Ross' offending.</p>

<p>The court heard Ross held Tanilla under cold water and called her an 'animal' before slamming her head against the shower screen twice and abandoning her in a pram for 36 hours to die.</p>

<p>In the months before she died, Tanilla was forced to run around the house until she collapsed, had a heavy tool box dropped on her hand and was whipped with an electrical cord during toilet training. </p>

<p>'The level of terror engendered in this child even before the assault that caused her death was extreme,' she told the court, adding that he could make Tanilla scream in fear simply by picking up a cord. </p>

<p>During Ross' sentencing, the court heard he also made jokes that he could make the two-year-old scream while whipping her with a belt and kicked her across the room head-first into a cupboard.</p>
