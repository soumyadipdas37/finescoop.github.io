<p>'What I eat doesn’t define who I am': Lucy Spraggan detailed her struggle with binge eating as she shared a candid post via Instagram on Saturday following her recent weight loss</p>

<p>'I’m gonna get my lifters on, get my a** down to the gym and throw around some weights, then I’m going to have an afternoon of lounging and hitting the cake.'</p>

<p>Lucy added that she had plans to see friends on Sunday so that they could embark on a long walk with their dogs before enjoying a roast dinner.</p>

<p>Speaking candidly about her relationship with food, Lucy went on: 'Quite honestly I can (still) be prone to binge eating if I forget to include balance in my lifestyle. </p>

<p>'I used to think "I’ll have this as a treat" and then I’d be really full of guilt and shame about what I’d eaten and I’d eat more to feel better. Then it’d go round in circles.</p>

<p>Honest: Of her binge eating struggle, Lucy said: 'I tend to relax a lot more on the weekends which can sometimes enable my laziness and unlock my passion for large bars of chocolate'</p>

<p>Candid: Speaking about her relationship with food, Lucy went on: 'I am definitely worthy of cake and ice cream, fruit and sweets, salad and steak and what I eat doesn’t define who I am'</p>

<p>'I learnt that I am definitely worthy of cake and ice cream, fruit and sweets, salad and steak and what I eat doesn’t define who I am.</p>

<p>'I’ll be eating what is tasty this weekend whilst being conscious about how much energy my body needs and not over-fuelling it. Learning about that really changed everything for me.'</p>

<p>Lucy marked 11 months of sobriety in June by sharing a candid post revealing how she's never 'felt as alive and awake' as she does now.  </p>

<p>All about balance: Lucy concluded, 'I’ll be eating what is tasty this weekend whilst being conscious about how much energy my body needs and not over-fuelling it'</p>

<p>The singer-songwriter overhauled her lifestyle following the breakdown of her marriage.</p>

<p>Writing on social media earlier this year, Lucy explained how she previously spent 'so much of her life just incredibly sad' and 'hiding behind the false confidence that drinking gave'.</p>

<p>The former X Factor contestant, who is releasing a new album soon, also added that giving up alcohol for almost a year is her 'biggest achievement to date'.</p>

<p>Never better: Lucy marked 11 months of sobriety in June by sharing a candid post revealing how she's never 'felt as alive and awake' after giving up alcohol</p>

<p>Candid: Lucy shared a lengthy post revealing she got tired of 'hiding behind the false confidence alcohol gave' as she celebrated her sobriety achievement</p>

<p>She wrote: 'Today I am 11 months sober. 11 months ago I had no idea what kind of an impact giving up alcohol would have on my life but I knew that I’d had enough of burying my problems, hiding behind the false confidence that drinking gave me and spending so much of my life just incredibly sad.</p>

<p>'I didn’t drink every day, I didn’t physically depend on alcohol, I couldn’t think of anything worse than drinking in the morning and I used to think that meant I didn’t have a problem. I didn’t fit the mould of what a person with an alcohol problem looked like.</p>

<p>'I was a self-described ‘life of the party’ which meant I needed everyone to be having MY kind of fun, everything had to be 100mph, I’d be pushy if you weren’t keeping up with me and I was always the last one to bed. Or not sometimes. But I always ended up in this miserable trance, either at the end of the night or for the days after.'</p>

<p>Lucy then reflected on what she has learned over the past months while she has turned her lifestyle completely upside down.</p>

<p>Ripped: The former X Factor contestant regularly shares updates from her fitness journey</p>

<p>She wrote: 'What I know about myself now after 11 months? I have issues with moderation. I either have the whole cake or no cake at all. </p>

<p>'I either work out so hard I fracture my own rib or I don’t work out. I know now that it wouldn’t just be one cheeky Guinness, so for me, it’s none at all. </p>

<p>'I have learnt what discipline means. With stopping an entire lifetime of habit I have learnt what it means to say no to myself, and in turn what it feels like to say ‘yes’ to myself. </p>

<p>Wow! Lucy overhauled her lifestyle to achieve her new ripped physique and healthy mindset following the breakdown of her marriage to Georgina Gordon</p>

<p>'To push my body to do incredible things, learn new skills, let actual authentic happiness into my brain. 11 months of sobriety, amongst a lot of other achievements I hold highly, is my biggest to date. Next month I turn 29 years old and 12 months sober. I have never felt as alive and awake as I do right now.</p>

<p>'My song ‘Sober’ on my new album ‘Choices’ is one of my favourite I’ve ever written and I can’t wait for you to hear it. You can pre-order it in my bio. Have the best day.'</p>

<p>Lucy has been showcasing her incredible fitness journey on her Instagram page, often posting jaw-dropping snaps of her abs.</p>

<p>The X Factor's new lifestyle includes four long-distance runs a week totalling 45km as well as three 90 minute weight lifting sessions.</p>

<p>Her everyday diet typically consists of cereal followed by vegetarian sausages and toast, salad and protein for lunch and fish, rice and salad for dinner.</p>

<p>Lucy's decision to change the way she was living was sparked following her split from wife Georgina Gordon, 31, who she married in 2016 after two years of dating.</p>

<p>The former couple endured several failed fertility attempts and announced their decision to separate last November.</p>

<p>Explaining how fitness has also helped her mentally to Closer magazine, Lucy explained: 'I needed mental clarity to deal with the preparation of divorce and fitness and feeling good has definitely helped my state of mind.' </p>

<p>Slimmed down: Lucy said the changes have helped her feel better mentally as well as physically</p>
