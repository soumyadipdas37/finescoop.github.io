<p>The next step: Nicole Williams has been married to football veteran Larry English since 2017 and the couple are now thinking about adding to their family</p>

<p>Nicole got personal as she talked about having children with the athlete. 'We definitely want human babies one day!' said the star who has dogs with Larry.</p>

<p>The beauty, who has modeled for Rihanna's lingerie line as well as Khloe Kardashian's Good American also said they don't wait to wait.</p>

<p>She will welcome children 'hopefully sooner than later' she shared.</p>

<p>'We’ve been talking about it for years and getting closer to pulling the trigger,' added Williams.</p>

<p>Happy to share: The WAGS star told DailyMail.com exclusively that they have been talking about having children for 'years' and can't wait to see 'mini Nicoles and Larrys' running around. 'We’ve been talking about it for years and getting closer to pulling the trigger,' added Williams</p>

<p>The cover girl looked stunning in her new PETA PSA.</p>

<p>The star wore yellow and had her makeup nicely done as she sat in her car for what starts out as a makeup tutorial.</p>

<p>She is in the passenger seat on a car parked in the shade with the window cracked. It does not seem as if she could overheat, but she does and she passes out.</p>

<p>More to love: 'We definitely want human babies one day!' said the star who has dogs with Larry. The beauty, who has modeled for Rihanna's lingerie line as well as Khloe Kardashian's Good American also said they don't wait to wait. She will welcome children 'hopefully sooner than later' she shared</p>

<p>The point is made clear: even if a car is parked in the shade with the window cracked open, it can still be too hot. </p>

<p>She tells fans that after 20 minutes that car can get up to 100 degrees F even on a cool day. </p>

<p>Nicole told DailyMail.com that this needs to be avoided as from 2018 to 2019, at least 82 animals suffered heat stroke and died in a hot car.    </p>

<p>Her new clip: This comes just as the Savage x Fenty model debuted her PSA for PETA about how leaving a dog in a car can be fatal even when temperatures are at 70 degrees F and a window is cracked</p>

<p>Too hot: She is in the passenger seat on a car parked in the shade with the window cracked but starts to feel uncomfortable</p>

<p>'If you have your dog with you and need to run errands my advice is to bring your dog home where they will be safe,' she shared. 'Even if it’s just for two minutes, that is still too long because it gets hot very quickly - even with the windows cracked.'</p>

<p>And then the Instagram favorite added, 'The goal is to just spread awareness and hope that people who really never thought of how dangerous it can be leaving dogs in the car will now have the right information and can handle situations differently.</p>

<p>The couple have 'two adorable French Bulldogs,' she said.</p>

<p>No way  out: She cannot open the door or call for help so she yells out the crack in the window for help but no one comes</p>

<p>Sweating: It does not seem as if she could overheat, but she does and cannot move </p>

<p>A sad end: The star is then seen passing out in the car. Nicole told DailyMail.com that this needs to be avoided as from 2018 to 2019, at least 82 animals suffered heat stroke and died in a hot car</p>

<p>'Jasmine is my first born, she’s 7 and the sweetest thing you’ve ever seen. She LOVES to eat, is super smart and loves to boss her brother around,' added Williams.</p>

<p>'Ace is my boy, he’s 6 and we adopted him from the Chicago French Bulldog Rescue. Fun fact is that he was living with his foster family in Aurora and that is also where Larry is from! So both of my boys are from the same city! </p>

<p>'He’s the most needy of the two, loves to be rubbed and snuggled and loves baths unlike his sister, who can only last five minutes in the tub. They eat cooked organic meals. I also add in all of their healthy vitamins daily! They are probably the reason we do not have real human babies yet, we treat them like they are human, they even have car seats in the car! We love them so much.'</p>

<p>Their fur children: The couple have 'two adorable French Bulldogs,' she said. 'Jasmine is my first born, she’s 7 and the sweetest thing you’ve ever seen. She LOVES to eat, is super smart and loves to boss her brother around,' added Williams. 'Ace is my boy, he’s 6 and we adopted him from the Chicago French Bulldog Rescue'</p>

<p>As far as being an Instagram star, she says she really enjoys the posts that involve traveling.</p>

<p>'I love to travel and experience different cultures and food. Seeing the world and being able to share that with my two million followers is very fun. I get to take them with me in a way! </p>

<p>'I also love fashion so getting dressed up and changing into multiple outfits a day is something I love to do, that way it’s a new look for each place I take a photo and there’s so much cool content to capture.'</p>
