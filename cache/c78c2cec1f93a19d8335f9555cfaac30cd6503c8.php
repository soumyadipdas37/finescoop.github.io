<p>Welcome to the <?php echo e('@'); ?>ufc Summer Tapasa!! I’m so happy you chose a career with us 👊🏻👊🏻 pic.twitter.com/GCmcCJF6sL</p>

<p>White had expressed his intentions to get Summer on board at the UFC, and he has now announced that the hero security guard has joined the promotion's security team. </p>

<p>'Do you remember the girl, Summer, that worked for Best Buy as security in Hawaii?' he said in a clip on Twitter. </p>

<p>'Somebody was stealing a TV, some dude, and she beat his ass and stopped him from stealing the TV, and she got fired from Best Buy which I thought was horrible.</p>

<p>'So I brought her out to Vegas, I offered her a job here and she went back to Hawaii, she weighed up all her options and she decided to come work for the UFC, so she is now a UFC employee. </p>

<p>Summer Tapasa (pictured) went viral after a clip of her stopping a male thief circulated online</p>

<p>A viral video showed Tapasa stopping the thief at the Best Buy store in Waimulu, Hawaii </p>

<p>Footage shows Tapasa pushing the would be thief as he tries to get out of the store</p>

<p>'So all you people thinking about f****** around over here at the UFC, you'll get your ass whooped by Summer!'</p>

<p>The newly-hired security guard shared her thoughts on her new job, while posing outside the UFC headquarters in a company t-shirt. </p>

<p>'My name is Summer Tapasa and I am a UFC corporate security officer. I've been working for the UFC for eight days. I'm looking forward to expanding my career and hopefully moving on up.'</p>

<p>The would-be thief left the store empty-handed but Tapasa was dismissed from her position</p>

<p>Footage from the original clip shows Tapasa taking a wide stance as she stands in front of the exit. </p>

<p>The thief - a male - can be seen charging at her with a box in his hand.  </p>

<p>Tapasa repeatedly pushes the man away from the door, eventually getting him to crash into a nearby sign. </p>

<p>The two soon go flying out of the camera's view, with another Best Buy employee falling on top of them to separate them.</p>

<p>'I've been a big girl my entire life,' she said in a post from earlier this year. 'Yet, I would have never thought I’d be given the opportunities I’m getting now. I’ve been talked about my entire life. Yet, I still carry on.' </p>
