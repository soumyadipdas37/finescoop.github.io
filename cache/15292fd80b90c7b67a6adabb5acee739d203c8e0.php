<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A driver high on drugs and alcohol killed a 16-year-old schoolboy in a crash, then moved his unconscious friend into the driving seat to frame her for the boy's death, a court heard. </p>

<p>Kanad Basi, who had taken cocaine and ecstasy and was almost twice the drink drive limit, drove into a bend at speed, lost control and crashed into a tree in Lesmahagow, near Lanark in Scotland.</p>

<p>His front seat passenger Jack Frame suffered catastrophic head injuries and died at the scene. </p>

<p>The 22-year-old driver then climbed into the back of the car and pushed another passenger, Ellie Plenderleith, behind the wheel.</p>

<p>Basi, from Pollokshields, Glasgow, who sat in the dock wearing a facemask, was told by judge Lord Mulholland: 'This is an utter tragedy for the family of the deceased who lost his life with catastrophic injuries which you were responsible for with your driving.</p>

<p>'If ever there was a case that showed the folly of the combination of drugs, alcohol and speed, it is this case.'</p>

<p>Kanad Basi at the High Court in Glasgow where he pled guilty to causing the death by dangerous driving of 16-year-old Jack Frame</p>

<p>Ellie Plenderleith was a passenger in the car, who Basi then tried to frame for Jack Frame's death by pushing her into the driving seat</p>

<p>Basi admitted at the High Court in Glasgow to causing the death of Jack by driving dangerously on New Trows Road, Lesmahagow, on February 10, 2019.</p>

<p>Rear passengers Aiden O'Donnell and Eleanor Plenderleith suffered horrific injuries in the crash.</p>

<p>At the High Court in Glasgow prosecutor Jane Farquharson told the court that Basi had driven to a party in Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire, in his BMW 1 series two-door coupe around 1am.</p>

<p>A number of the partygoers were impressed by the car and clamoured to go for a spin in it and three of them drove off with him at 2am.</p>

<p>Ms Farquharson said: 'As the accused approached a right hand bend, he lost control of the car. His vehicle left the carriageway, mounted the grass verge, collided with a wire fence and struck a tree in the grounds of Hallandbush Golf Club.</p>

<p>'Due to this impact Jack Frame was thrown forward and trapped within the front passenger side of the vehicle. His head was wedged underneath the glove box area.'</p>

<p>Apprentice joiner Aiden, who was 18 at the time was sitting behind Basi. He suffered a fractured skull, four facial fractures, two broken legs and a number of fractures to his left arm. He had to under surgery and learn to walk again. He has been unable to work since the accident.</p>

<p>Eleanor, who at the time was 19, and worked as a sandwich artist at Subway, was knocked unconscious. She had a punctured lung, lacerated liver, broken ribs and a fractured chestbone. A metal plate had to be inserted into her left upper arm.</p>

<p>None of the passengers was wearing a seat belt. Basi, who was wearing one, suffered a broken wrist. His DNA and blood were found on the driver's airbag.</p>

<p>The prosecutor added: 'Neither passenger has any recollection about the incident itself, or what happened thereafter.</p>

<p>Front seat passenger Jack Frame suffered catastrophic head injuries and died at the scene</p>

<p>'In the immediate aftermath the accused removed his seat belt and climbed into the rear of the vehicle pushing passenger Eleanor Plenderleith into the front.</p>

<p>'She was found unconscious with her legs in the rear seating area and her head facing down into the driver's footwell.'</p>

<p>The court heard that Basi used Aiden's phone to call 999 and during that conversation claimed he was the driver.</p>

<p>However, later sitting in the back of an ambulance he was asked by police if he was the driver and replied: 'I can't remember now, but give me half an hour or so and I might remember. I woke up in the back with my friend Aiden and pulled the girl over the front. There were only four in the car.'</p>

<p>A breath test showed Basi had an alcohol count of 37. The legal limit is 22. A blood sample taken from him showed the presence of cocaine and ecstasy.</p>

<p>Lord Mulholland remanded first offender Basi in custody and deferred sentence on him until next month for background reports.</p>

<p>Solicitor advocate Billy Lavelle said: 'He works as a waiter in the family business.'</p>
