<p>This week Countdown’s lexicographer Susie Dent checks into our travel Q&amp;A.</p>

<p>She talks about her earliest travel memory, the oddest-named place she's visited, her favourite UK destination - and more.  </p>

<p>WHAT'S YOUR EARLIEST TRAVEL MEMORY?</p>

<p>Sitting in the back of the car, heading for the South Coast — my parents loved the sea even in winter. I just wanted to stay warm and dry in the car and read.</p>

<p>EVER VISITED A PLACE JUST FOR ITS NAME?</p>

<p>Little Snoring in Norfolk. It’s said to have been named after a leader called Snare, just as Nottingham (once Snotingham) was led by a man called Snot.</p>

<p>ODDEST-NAMED PLACE YOU’VE EVER VISITED?</p>

<p>Probably the tiny hamlet of Come-to-Good in Cornwall. It’s huddled in a valley and is home to an old Quaker meeting house.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE UK DESTINATION?</p>

<p>Oxford, because that’s where I studied and later returned to live. I love its secret histories and beauty.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE FOREIGN CITY?</p>

<p>Susie says that her favourite foreign city is New York as she loves its edginess </p>

<p>I lived in New York for a couple of years while studying: I love its edginess as well as its cafes, skylines and sunsets.</p>

<p>FAVOURITE PLACE IN THE U.S.?</p>

<p>The Henry Clay Frick House, for its amazing art collection. It was an oasis for me in the stifling NYC summers when I had no air conditioning at home. I would sit for hours in its cool garden court.</p>

<p>YOU SPEAK GERMAN - WHAT'S YOUR TOP SPOT IN GERMANY?</p>

<p>Berlin. It wears its history with courage and resilience, and is mesmerising in so many ways. And, wow, the food (even for a vegetarian like me).</p>
