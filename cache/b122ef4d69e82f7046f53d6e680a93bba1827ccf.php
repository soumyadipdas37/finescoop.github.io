<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal midfielder Joe Willock insists the young players in Mikel Arteta's squad will continue to snap at the heels of the established stars after Wednesday's third-round Carabao Cup victory at Leicester.</p>

<p>The Gunners made seven changes for the trip to the King Power Stadium, where a Christian Fuchs own goal and a late tap-in for Eddie Nketiah secured a 2-0 win for the visitors.</p>

<p>Willock and Nketiah were joined in the starting line-up by Bukayo Saka, Reiss Nelson and Ainsley Maitland-Niles, as Arteta continues to give chances to the young players at his disposal.</p>

<p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta handed Willock his first start of the season in the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>Of that quintet, Saka and new England international Maitland-Niles are the only ones to start a Premier League game so far this season.</p>

<p>But, with fixtures coming thick and fast, Willock believes the core of young players can provide the right level of competition to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>'That is our job as players, as youngsters,' said Willock, who made the bench in Arsenal's first Premier League game this season, the 3-0 win away to Fulham.</p>

<p>'We're always trying to make it difficult for the manager to make a decision who plays on the weekend.</p>

<p>'So that is what we're trying to do, we're all trying to push each other to be better and play as good as we can.'</p>

<p>Willock, 21, was born in Waltham Forest in east London and is a product of the Arsenal youth system. He is strong, just over six feet tall, and he 'can play as a traditional No 8 in the middle of the park, or in a more advanced role.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old can be a strong physical presence in the Arsenal midfield this season</p>

<p>While he is yet to feature in the top tier this season, he made an impressive 29 Premier League appearances in 2019-20, albeit that included only eight starts.</p>

<p>And although time on the pitch may have been limited, he has made an impact, particularly in his defensive duties, making 25 tackles with a success rate of 64 per cent, which is better than Arsenal's first-choice midfielders.</p>

<p>The Arsenal midfield is a highly competitive department, but if Lucas Torreira is heading for the exit and Mesut Ozil remains out of favour opportunities may well develop for the youngster.</p>

<p>Granit Xhaka, Dani Cellabos, Saka, Mohamed Elneny and Maitland-Niles have all started ahead of Willock in the two Premier League wins this season.Â Matteo Guendouzi is yet to make the bench.</p>

<p>However, Arteta does see value in Willock.</p>

<p>He faces a lot of competition in Arsenal's midfield but hopes he can play a big role this term</p>

<p>'I think he's got incredible physical attributes but as well he's a very intelligent boy,' the manager told Football.London in February. 'He learns really quickly, he's very willing, I think he's developing really, really well and I'm very pleased with him.'</p>

<p>After initially admitting there was some skepticism at Arsenal over the appointment of Arteta last season, Willock now praises the manager's hands-on approach and the clear way in which he wants his team to play.</p>

<p>'The manager has very key principles,' added Willock after Wednesday's win.</p>

<p>'There are things that we have to do and there is nothing we can't ask; we can always ask him to help us.</p>

<p>'That is what I did before the game - slotting into midfield I asked him for a few pointers and I thought I did well.'</p>
