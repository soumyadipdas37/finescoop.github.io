<p>If the snake is a python, it is not venomous. </p>

<p>Don't ever try to pick up a snake. </p>

<p>Don't ever kill one.</p>

<p>If you have one in your house, call a snake catcher.</p>

<p>A social media post by Snake Catchers Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan and Gold Coast, compared it to a scene from E.T. where the alien hid inside of the cupboard.</p>

<p>'They noticed the animal there in the corner. It didn't come at them or surprise them or anything like that,' Mr Robinson told 7news.com.au.</p>

<p>'It was simply a carpet snake curled up in a corner.'</p>

<p>He believed the snake came through one of the doors in the house.   </p>

<p>Carpet pythons are a snake that does tend to stray towards taking refuge in homes.</p>

<p>They are also not an unusual type of snake to find around Brisbane. </p>

<p>'As a general rule, snakes will occupy pretty much any niche within the suburban environment,' Mr Robinson said. </p>
