<p>Clubs have until October 5 to wrap up their business but complications caused by the ongoing pandemic mean they'll be keen to get their signings in sooner in time for pre-season training.</p>

<p>Though Chelsea have finally got their Kai Havertz deal over the line, there are still a few loose ends to tie up.</p>

<p>Here, Sportsmail's TOBY MILES provided live updates from Premier League and European clubs as they continued to negotiate and completed signings during the summer transfer window.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>That's all from another busy day in the summer transfer window.</p>

<p>Tune in again tomorrow for all the latest updates.</p>

<p>Manchester United midfielder Dylan Levitt is in talks over a loan move to Charlton Athletic. </p>

<p>The highly-rated 19-year-old was handed his full Wales debut last week by manager Ryan Giggs during their Nations League victory over Finland. </p>

<p>Georginio Wijnaldum 'is increasingly likely' to leave Liverpool and reunite with former Holland manager Ronald Koeman at Barcelona.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old midfielder has played an integral part in Jurgen Klopp's revolution at Anfield, very rarely missing a game as they won the Champions League and Premier League.</p>

<p>James Rodriguez has arrived in the city of Liverpool ahead of the imminent completion of his move to Everton.</p>

<p>The Real Madrid playmaker is set to join the Toffees on a three-year deal, reuniting him with Carlo Ancelotti, who he worked under both at the Bernabeu and at Bayern Munich, with the fee reported to be around the £20m mark. </p>

<p>Chelsea defender Ethan Ampadu is wanted on loan at Sheffield United.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old is at a crucial stage of his career where he needs to play more regular, competitive football and Chris Wilder is willing to give him an opportunity at Bramall Lane.</p>

<p>Manchester United reportedly want to bring in up to three more signings before the transfer window shuts.</p>

<p>The Red Devils have long been chasing Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho who remains their priority signing.</p>

<p>Callum Wilson has completed his £20million move to Newcastle United from Bournemouth and will take the No 9 jersey.</p>

<p>The striker finalised the terms of a four-year deal on Monday morning and will now meet his new team-mates ahead of Saturday's Premier League opener at West Ham.</p>

<p>As if the sight of Frank Lampard once again pulling the strings at Chelsea wasn’t enough nostalgia for fans to swoon over, Roman Abramovich is once again opening his chequebook and brandishing zeros like they were going out of fashion. It feels just like old times at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The Russian billionaire owner may have been conspicuous by his absence in west London over the past two years, but his commitment to the club has never been clearer after sanctioning a mammoth spending spree this summer – one that is set to become the biggest splurge in a single window by any Premier League club.</p>

<p>Willian jokingly told Thiago Silva that he would have turned down a move to Arsenal and stayed at Chelsea if he knew the defender was heading to Stamford Bridge, the Telegraph have claimed.</p>

<p>Silva, 35, signed a one-year deal with the Blues last month after his contract at Paris Saint-Germain expired, allowing the defender to leave the Champions League runners-up on a free. </p>

<p>Crystal Palace have asked about Fluminense forward Evanilson, 20, and are monitoring developments with Jeremie Boga the former Chelsea winger now at Sassuolo. </p>

<p>Evanilson, has also been watched by Liverpool and Manchester City, is open to the move but Fluminense would like him to stay until the end of the Brazilian season.</p>

<p>Atalanta have entered negotiations with Chelsea to sign Davide Zappacosta on loan for next season, according to reports.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old has fallen out of favour in west London and the club are actively attempting to ship him out again in the current window. </p>

<p>Donny van de Beek's youth team coach at Ajax insists his former protege moving to Real Madrid this summer would have been a 'disaster'. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old, who rose to prominence in the Ajax side which reached the 2019 Champions League semi-final, completed a £40million move to Manchester United last week. </p>

<p>Gareth Bale is set for showdown talks with Zinedine Zidane at Real Madrid over his future at the club.</p>

<p>The Wales international hit out at Real Madrid in a recorded interview, for making it 'very difficult' for him to leave, and admitted he would consider a return to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Newcastle United have reportedly reached an agreement to sign Ryan Fraser, with the former Bournemouth winger set to undergo a medical on Monday. </p>

<p>The 26-year-old will arrive at St James' Park on a free transfer following the expiry of his Cherries contract, according to Sky Sports.</p>

<p>Barcelona are planning to make a final offer for Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez.</p>

<p>Recently-appointed Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has informed Luis Suarez that he isn't in his plans, with Juventus looking to sign the Uruguayan.</p>

<p>Good morning and welcome to another day of the summer transfer window.</p>
