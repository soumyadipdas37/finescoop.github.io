<p>The tech giant will implement its sensitive event policy, which is rolled out during fast moving events in order to avoid confusion among the public.</p>

<p>In the email to advertisers, Google states it will not allow ads 'referencing candidates, the election, or its outcome, given that an unprecedented amount of votes will be counted after election day this year.'</p>

<p>Google is set to block ads related to the US presidential election after polls close on November 3, according to an email obtained by DailyMail.com. The tech giant will implement its sensitive event policy, which is rolled out during fast moving events in order to avoid confusion among the public</p>

<p>Online powerhouses have been working overtime ahead of the 2020 election with the goal of avoiding the 2016 campaign fiasco.</p>

<p>To do its part, Google has announced new features for its search engine over the past few weeks to provide detailed information about how to register and vote, directing users to local election administrators.</p>

<p>The firm has also implemented protocols to YouTube, which will l take down content aimed at manipulation, including 'videos that contain hacked information about a political candidate shared with the intent to interfere in an election.'</p>

<p>YouTube will also remove videos promoting efforts to interfere with the voting process such as telling viewers to create long voting lines.</p>

<p>In the email to advertisers, Google states it will not allow ads 'referencing candidates, the election, or its outcome, given that an unprecedented amount of votes will be counted after election day this year</p>

<p>However, the tech giant is looking beyond the path to the polls, as it expects 'a substantial increase in election ad submissions' as we inch closer to November 3.</p>

<p>The email tells advertisers that they should expect up to 48 hours for ad approvals and Google will no longer do expedited requests due to the expected volume of submissions.</p>

<p>The sensitive events policy will block ads running on Google Ads, DV360, YouTube and AdX Authorized Buyer.</p>

<p>'It will include ads that are currently in-scope of our election ads policy (mentioning a current state or federal officeholder or candidate, political party, or ballot measure), ads that reference federal or state elections within the ad, and any ads running on election-related search queries, including on candidates or officeholders,' the email reads.Â </p>

<p>Google has activated its sensitive event policy amid the coronavirus and also during the Belerus presidential election that was held last month.</p>

<p>Another online giant, Facebook, is also blocking political ads, but will do so ahead of the election.</p>

<p>CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced earlier this month that it is set to ban all new political advertisements the week before the election as part of a series of moves to prevent interference in the November contest.</p>

<p>'We're going to block new political and issue ads during the final week of the campaign. It's important that campaigns can run get out the vote campaigns, and I generally believe the best antidote to bad speech is more speech, but in the final days of an election there may not be enough time to contest new claims,' Zuckerberg wrote in a Facebook post.</p>

<p>The sweeping set of actions - the biggest the company has announced to date - comes amid what is expected to be a contentious election between President Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Election Day is two months away.</p>
