<p>The latest posts come after Honey poked fun at her famous father's dress sense, but it was all done in a playful tone. </p>

<p>TV host Jonathan, 59. had shared a picture of himself backstage, wearing a black fringed jacket. </p>

<p>And Honey reposted it writing: 'A family of fashion icons? Not for me to say.'</p>

<p>She previously said that being targeted by trolls online was what spurred her into having an obsession with her weight at the tender age of 12.</p>

<p>Being featured alongside her family online allowed such comments to be posted - with Honey opting into Weight Watchers and requesting a personal trainer by age 14.</p>

<p>The celebrity offspring shed weight but felt 'more miserable' and irritated that people who had ignored her previously were suddenly being friendly.</p>

<p>She told The Sun: 'I was thin and very intimidating. People who had never given me a second glance were being so nice to me and flirting with me. And I was f**king furious. It made me see everything really clearly. When you are a fat woman, sometimes you’re not even treated like a person.</p>

<p>'Because I’ve got a gut, apparently that’s a big deal. I am really attractive,' Honey said. </p>

<p>'I’m an attractive young woman who wants to enjoy my life and my body in the same way that my thin friends have always been allowed to.' </p>

<p>Haha! Honey gently poked fun at her father Jonathan's dress sense as he posed in his fringed jacket - but it was all very playful </p>
