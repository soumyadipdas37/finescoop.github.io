<p>And Lizzie Cundy ensured all eyes would be on her as she joined a friend for lunch in Chelsea, London on Thursday.  </p>

<p>Clad in a crop top and mini skirt, the TV personality, 52, was dressed to stop traffic, but instead ended up with a parking ticket after leaving her Mercedes in a suspended parking zone.</p>

<p>Bold: She's never been one to blend into the background. And Lizzie Cundy ensured all eyes would be on her as she joined a friend for lunch in Chelsea, London on Thursday</p>

<p>Turning heads on the outing, Lizzie looked sensational in a ruffled pink blouse that flashed a glimpse of her toned stomach. </p>

<p>She teamed the garment with a thigh-skimming mini skirt with a pretty lace overlay that grazed her tanned and toned pins. </p>

<p>Boosting her modelesque frame, Lizzie donned a pair of strappy nude heels and accessorised with oversized shades. </p>

<p>Lizzie's friend looked equally as glamorous for the outing as she teamed a black bardot top with leather shorts and chunky gold jewellery.  </p>

<p>Oops: Clad in a crop top and mini skirt, the TV personality, 52, was dressed to stop traffic, but instead ended up with a parking ticket</p>

<p>Still chirpy: Lizzie was penalised for leaving her Mercedes in a suspended parking zone, but it didn't seem to put a dampener on the day's events</p>

<p>Lizzie and her pal no doubt had plenty to talk about after she was seen out for dinner with eligible bachelor Niccolo Barattieri.</p>

<p>Niccolo has previously been linked to model Elizabeth Hurley after they were spotted having dinner together in Mayfair back in 2018. </p>

<p>His white Maserati was also said to be spotted regularly outside her Chelsea home at the time.</p>

<p>Top of the crops: Turning heads on the outing, Lizzie looked sensational in a ruffled pink blouse that flashed a glimpse of her toned stomach</p>

<p>Legs eleven! She teamed the garment with a thigh-skimming mini skirt with a pretty lace overlay that grazed her tanned and toned pins</p>

<p>The Italian property developer previously dated Princess Diana's niece Lady Kitty Spencer however they split in 2017.</p>

<p>Lizzie will no doubt invite Niccolo to the lavish bash she is planning after she was forced to cancel her 52nd birthday during lockdown in May.</p>

<p>In true Lizzie style, she has promised a huge party once life returns to normal with the proceeds from the bash going to the National Health Service. </p>

<p>All about the accessories: Boosting her modelesque frame, Lizzie donned a pair of strappy nude heels and accessorised with oversized shades</p>

<p>Stylish: Lizzie's friend looked equally as glamorous for the outing as she teamed a black bardot top with leather shorts and chunky gold jewellery</p>

<p>Ladies who lunch: The duo were travelling in style in Lizzie's new white Mercedes, even if they did end up picking up a parking ticket </p>

<p>Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, she said: I really want to give back and say thank you to the NHS as they have been so incredible and I’m so thankful to have got through the coronavirus myself</p>

<p>'I’m so sad not to be with my family and friends and especially be with my son on my special day but know we will all be together soon...</p>

<p>'Good times are in their way ! I want my party to be the biggest fund raiser for the NHS to give thanks!'</p>

<p>Interesting: Lizzie and her pal no doubt had plenty to talk about after she was seen out for dinner with Niccolo Barattieri, who was previously linked to Elizabeth Hurley (pictured in 2018)</p>
