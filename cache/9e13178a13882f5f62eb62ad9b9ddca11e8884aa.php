<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An ancient form of wrestling is dying out in India because it requires men to become celibate and avoid alcohol and tobacco.</p>

<p>Kushti wrestlers train for twelve hours a day and the sport recruits boys as young as six years old, but it has lost popularity among younger generations.</p>

<p>Photographer, Mitchell Kanashkevich, 39, from Sydney, Australia, took pictures of traditional kushti wrestlers in Kolhapur, India.</p>

<p>In one image, a man tackled a young boy to the ground pinning him upside down during an intense training session.</p>

<p>In another picture, several thousand spectators watched on as teenage fighters competed for the title of champion.</p>

<p>Kushti wrestling, also known as pehlwani, is practiced on soil, with the word kushti translating as 'wrestling ground with hallowed earth'.</p>

<p>Wrestlers practice weight lifting and preach a life of total discipline, practicing celibacy as well as alcohol and tobacco abstinence. </p>

<p>Due to the strict training, diet and celibacy requirements, it is becoming increasingly unpopular among younger generations.</p>

<p>The gyms the wrestlers used to train in, known as akhara, are one of the few places in India where Hindu men who come from different castes are considered equals. </p>

<p>They are trained by a local guru called a palawan with the assistance of older trainers. Their only training attire is the kowpeenam or loincloth.</p>

<p>Mitchell said: 'These were very tough looking men engaging in what some might deem to be a very primeval activity - trying to hurt each other - but they were warm and friendly.</p>

<p>'Some trainers would whip the wrestlers and of course, they're actively wrestling each other but outside of the pit, they were very brotherly - joking, chatting, and taking care of each other.</p>

<p>'They'd all come from such different backgrounds. Some of the younger boys were better off financially and had been sent by their fathers for disciplinary purposes.</p>

<p>The origins of this form of wrestling date back to the 5th millennium BC when its precursor, Malla-yuddha was practiced</p>

<p>'Being so close to the action, I was at risk of finding a body being slammed down on top of me, but thankfully that didn't happen. You could feel the power ricochet though each time there was a "crash".</p>

<p>'To an outsider, these men seem brutal but the concept of "don't judge a book by its cover" is very appropriate here.'</p>

<p>The origins of this form of wrestling date back to the 5th millennium BC when its precursor, Malla-yuddha was practiced. Becoming a Kushti champion earns respect and glory in the community.</p>

<p>Still in existence today, Kushti wrestling schools train wrestlers with a strict 12 hours-a-day training regimen. The youngest trainees are just six years old.</p>
