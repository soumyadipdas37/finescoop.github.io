<p>Lukashenko told visiting Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in Minsk on Thursday that the call between Berlin and Warsaw showed that the incident was a 'falsification'.</p>

<p>Lukashenko told Mishustin in Minsk on Thursday that the call between Berlin and Warsaw showed that the incident was a 'falsification'</p>

<p>'There was no poisoning of Navalny,' Lukashenko told a poker-faced Mishustin during their televised meeting, pictured above </p>

<p>'They did it - I quote - in order to discourage (Russian President Vladimir) Putin from sticking his nose into Belarus's affairs.'</p>

<p>Lukashenko provided no further details but said he would hand over transcripts to Russia's security services.</p>

<p>The longtime Belarusian leader is under huge pressure from opposition protesters demanding his resignation after a disputed presidential election on August 9.</p>

<p>Tens of thousands have taken to the streets for weeks in unprecedented protests against Lukashenko's 26-year rule.</p>

<p>The claim about Navalny could be aimed at currying favour with Moscow, which has voiced support for Lukashenko during the protests.</p>

<p>Navalny's top aide Leonid Volkov dismissed the claim as ridiculous, accusing the Russian prime minister of being an accomplice to the 'attempted murder' by playing along in 'this circus'.</p>

<p>The West is demanding answers from Moscow today after the 'despicable and cowardly' nerve agent attack on Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. </p>

<p>Britain said the Kremlin 'has a clear case to answer' while NATO demanded a 'full and transparent' investigation after a German military lab found that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok, the Soviet-era weapon used against Sergei Skripal in 2018. </p>

<p>Angela Merkel is now facing pressure to get tough with Vladimir Putin, with questions growing about the future of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. </p>

<p>One German lawmaker said 'toughness is the only language Putin understands' - suggesting that the Kremlin had targeted Navalny as a show of force to intimidate protesters in Belarus.  </p>

<p>Navalny remains in a coma at a Berlin hospital after he collapsed on a flight in Siberia two weeks ago, becoming the latest in a long line of Russian dissidents to be poisoned in mysterious circumstances. </p>

<p>Russia denies involvement and said today that the West should not 'rush to judgment' on the attack, insisting there was no need for sanctions. </p>

<p>But the Russian economy is already feeling the effects of the crisis, with the ruble and the Moscow stock market both plunging since Berlin's announcement.   </p>

<p>German chancellor Angela Merkel (pictured) is under pressure to get tough with Vladimir Putin after a military lab found evidence that Navalny was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent </p>

<p>Merkel said last night that the findings at the German military lab had raised 'some very serious questions that only Russia can and must answer'. </p>

<p>'It is certain that Alexei Navalny is the victim of a crime,' she added. 'He was meant to be silenced and I condemn this in the strongest possible terms.' </p>

<p>UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the Kremlin 'has a clear case to answer' and 'must tell the truth about what happened', while prime minister Boris Johnson called the attack 'outrageous'.  </p>

<p>European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen condemned a 'despicable and cowardly act', while French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced the attack as 'shocking and irresponsible.'</p>

<p>'The Russian people have a right to express their views peacefully without fear of retribution of any kind, and certainly not with chemical agents,' said US National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot.</p>

<p>NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemned the 'shocking' use of a military-grade nerve agent which, he said, made 'a full and transparent' investigation by Russia even more urgent.</p>

<p>Italy's foreign ministry and Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne also condemned Navalny's poisoning. </p>

<p>The Western outrage has raised the prospect of new sanctions against Russia and thrown the future of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline into fresh doubt. </p>

<p>Construction of the 750-mile pipeline under the Baltic Sea is nearly finished but it needs to complete a final 75-mile stretch in Danish waters. </p>

<p>Germany's best-selling newspaper, Bild, wrote in an editorial today that 'if the German government does not cancel the construction of Nord Stream 2, we will soon be financing Putin's Novichok attacks'. </p>

<p>German lawmaker Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's CDU party, called for a 'European response' said continuing with the gas pipeline would be 'maximum confirmation for Putin that his policies are right'. </p>

<p>Going further than Merkel, Roettgen said he did not believe that Novichok could have been administered without the Kremlin's knowledge. </p>

<p>'We need a clear and European response. It needs toughness against Russia, because that's the only language Putin understands,' he told ZDF television.   </p>

<p>He also suggested that Navalny's poisoning had been meant to intimidate protesters in Belarus who are demanding the resignation of the Putin-backed dictator. </p>

<p>'This is the simultaneous intimidation of [Russia's] own population and also that in Belarus,' he said.  </p>

<p>The Kremlin has hinted at using military force to shore up Alexander Lukashenko's regime in Belarus, which has faced mass protests since a disputed election last month.  </p>

<p>Navalny is in a medically induced coma at the Charite hospital in Berlin (pictured on Wednesday) </p>

<p>Alexei Navalny could have had poison sprinkled in his underwear, according to the man who invented Novichok.</p>

<p>Friends of the Putin critic have suggested his tea was spiked in an airport cafe, but former Soviet scientist Vladimir Uglev said assassins could have sprinkled a deadly toxin on his socks or underwear. </p>

<p>Uglev, 73, said Russian secret service operatives could have broken into Navalny's hotel in Tomsk to leave a minuscule drop of poison in his luggage. </p>

<p>He warned that 'if this was indeed novichok, then Alexei [will] have some very serious complications'. </p>

<p>'Most likely the central and the peripheral nervous systems will be severely damaged,' Uglev said. </p>

<p>The scientist said Navalny may have been poisoned with a solid form of novichok known as A-242. </p>

<p>'If they used a liquid form, then inevitably somebody would have been hurt, people around him would have got inhalation injuries,' he said. </p>

<p>'This substance A-242 is safe by itself, but it acts as part of a solution applied to skin.</p>

<p>'It would be completely safe for other people and extremely dangerous to those who it was used against.'</p>

<p>Another scientist involved in novichok's development, Vil Mirzayanov, said it was plausible that Navalny's tea was spiked as his friends suggest.  </p>

<p>'This is a solid substance which can be turned into powder,' he said. 'It could have been placed into a tea bag.</p>

<p>'It got into the victim's digestive tract which is why Navalny could not pose any danger to people around him.' </p>

<p>Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference and a former German ambassador to Washington, said gestures such as the expulsion of diplomats may not be enough. </p>

<p>'If we want to send a clear message to Moscow with our partners, then economic relations must be on the agenda and that means the NordStream 2 project must not be left out,' said Ischinger. </p>

<p>Germany's Green party, which is currently second to Merkel's party in the polls, is also calling for the pipeline to be scrapped.     </p>

<p>Merkel said as recently as last week that the pipeline should go ahead and should not be linked to the Navalny case.  </p>

<p>Work on the pipeline was suspended after US sanctions were imposed in December, while Emmanuel Macron has also voiced concerns about it. </p>

<p>But Putin says it could be launched by the end of 2020 and Merkel said last week that 'our opinion is that Nord Stream 2 should be completed'.   </p>

<p>US Republican senator Tom Cotton last night urged a halt to Nord Stream construction in order to 'hold the Russians accountable'. </p>

<p>Cotton and two others last month threatened sanctions against the operator of a Baltic Sea port in Merkel's parliamentary constituency because of the pipeline.    </p>

<p>Maria Zakharova, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman, last night accused Germany of waging an 'information campaign' against Moscow. </p>

<p>'If politicians start taking job away from medics, I don't know where this world may find itself,' she told the news agency Interfax. </p>

<p>'As soon as politicians start substituting for medical institutions and doctors, you can speak immediately about absolute unscrupulousness.</p>

<p>'What do politicians, what does the German Foreign Office, and what does the German leadership have to do with that?'. </p>

<p>Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov today said there was 'no reason' to blame Moscow and urged the West not to 'rush to judgment'. </p>

<p>Peskov said there was no reason to discuss sanctions against Moscow after Merkel said Germany would consult its NATO allies about how to respond to the poisoning. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, Berlin's announcement ruble plunging to its lowest level since the height of Russia's coronavirus epidemic, at 89 rubles to the euro. </p>

<p>Moscow's RTS stock exchange also fell more than three per cent after the German announcement, and by Thursday morning had not recovered its losses. </p>

<p>While Berlin stopped short of directly accusing the Kremlin of poisoning Navalny, the opposition leader's aide Ivan Zhdanov said Novichok 'can only be used by the state' - suggesting that the GRU or FSB intelligence agencies were responsible.   </p>

<p>Another Navalny ally, Leonid Volkov, said: 'To poison Navalny with Novichok in 2020 would be exactly the same as leaving an autograph at a crime scene, like this one,' attaching a picture of Putin's name and a signature. </p>

<p>A plane carrying Navalny arrives at Berlin's Tegel Airport on August 22 after the Russian opposition leader was airlifted to Germany for specialist treatment </p>

<p>Navalny's allies have pointed the finger at Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) after the opposition leader fell ill, but the Kremlin has dismissed the claims </p>

<p>The nerve agent, whose name means 'newbie' or 'newcomer' in Russian, can be deployed in an ultra-fine powder, liquid or vapour.</p>

<p>It is thought to have been smeared on the door of former double agent Sergei Skripal in the 2018 assassination attempt in Salisbury. </p>

<p>Russia denied involvement but the poison plot sent Britain's relations with Moscow to their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. </p>

<p>The United States, EU members, NATO and other nations expelled over 150 Russian diplomats in a coordinated action against Moscow over the Skripal case, leading to tit-for-tat reactions from Moscow. </p>

<p>British police eventually named two suspects, who were later identified by the investigative website Bellingcat as members of Russia's GRU intelligence service. </p>

<p>Skripal and his daughter survived, but a British woman, Dawn Sturgess, later died after accidentally handling the discarded nerve agent in a perfume bottle. </p>

<p>The EU has had sanctions targeting whole sectors of the Russian economy in place since 2014. </p>

<p>Navalny's poisoning also comes after a daylight murder of a former Chechen rebel commander in a Berlin park in August last year, which German prosecutors believe was ordered by Russia.</p>

<p>Merkel had also revealed in May that Russia had targeted her in hacking attacks, saying she had concrete proof of the 'outrageous' spying attempts.</p>

<p>The two men accused of trying to assassinate Sergei Skripal with the same nerve agent were filmed on CCTV walking through Salisbury in March 2018 </p>

<p>Navalny fell ill after boarding a plane in Siberia last month, with aides saying they suspect he drank a cup of spiked tea at the airport.</p>

<p>He was initially treated in a local Siberian hospital, where doctors said they were unable to find any toxic substances in his blood. </p>

<p>He was flown to Berlin for specialist treatment on August 22, but the Kremlin has questioned the credibility of German doctors. </p>

<p>Russia's embassy in Berlin said in a statement: 'We call on our partners to avoid any politicisation of this incident and to rely solely on credible facts, which we hope will be delivered as soon as possible.'</p>

<p>The Charite hospital that has been treating Navalny reported improvements in his condition.</p>

<p>But the Yale-educated anti-corruption campaigner is still in the intensive care unit and remains on a ventilator.</p>

<p>Doctors say that over time the body can clear out the nerve agent, which disrupts communication between the brain, the main organs and muscles.</p>

<p>'Recovery is likely to be lengthy. It is still too early to gauge the long-term effects which may arise in relation to this severe poisoning,' added the hospital. </p>

<p>Navalny has been a thorn in the Kremlin's side for more than a decade, exposing what he says is high-level corruption and mobilising protests. </p>

<p>He has been repeatedly detained for organising public meetings, sued over corruption investigations and barred from running in the 2018 presidential election.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old has also served several stints in jail in recent years for organising anti-Kremlin protests. </p>

<p>The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Russia's arrests and detention of Navalny in 2012 and 2014 were politically motivated.   </p>
