<p>Gray, 24, has one year left on contract and could be willing to see it out with the prospect of leaving as a free agent next summer.</p>

<p>Manager Brendan Rodgers said: 'It'll be up to him. He's in his last year and he hasn't signed another deal but, for me, I will always respect Demarai and what his wishes are.</p>

<p>Leicester winger Demarai Gray (above) could leave as a free agent next summer</p>

<p>'He is working very hard to play a part while he's here. We'll see how it evolves over the course of the season.</p>

<p>'I've really enjoyed working with him. He's a good guy and has been here since he was a young player. While he's here he will always be respected for his quality and what he has.</p>

<p>'He is now 24 and it'll be whether he wants to continue in the role he's played here or whether he sees himself going out and becoming a starter.'</p>

<p>Gray could find his chances limited by the arrival of winger Cengiz Under from Roma</p>

<p>Turkey international Under is joining on loan with an option to buy for £24.6million.</p>

<p>Rodgers added: 'He's a very good player, there's been some negotiations with the clubs so we're hopeful we can get something there,' he said.</p>

<p>'We needed different types of attacking players to come in and support. Having watched him and seen him play he is clearly a talented player.'</p>

<p>Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers has hinted Demarai Gray could leave the Foxes this summer</p>
