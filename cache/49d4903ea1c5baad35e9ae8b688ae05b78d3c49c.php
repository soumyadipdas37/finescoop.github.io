<p>Steve Jenne says he marked the unusual 60-year milestone this week.</p>

<p>Jenne was a 14-year-old boy scout when Nixon, who was then Vice President, stopped by his small town of Sullivan for a campaign event on September 22, 1960.</p>

<p>He watched on as part of a boy scout honor guard as Nixon took a few bites from a barbecue buffalo sandwich during a cookout ahead of a speech he was giving for his presidential campaign. </p>

<p>Steve Jenne, of Illinois, has managed to preserve an old buffalo barbecue sandwich that Richard Nixon half ate at a campaign event 60 years ago</p>

<p>After Nixon was finished, Jenne says he snatched up the half-eaten sandwich. </p>

<p>'He took a couple of bites and commented on how tasty, how good it was,' Jenne told the Herald-Review. </p>

<p>'Once he left, I just looked down at the picnic table and everybody else was gone and that half-eaten sandwich was still on the paper plate. </p>

<p>'I looked around and thought, 'If no one else was going to take it, I am going to take it'.'</p>

<p>He said he rode home on his bicycle and presented his souvenir to his mother. </p>

<p>'I ran in the door and I said, 'Mom, I got the sandwich that Nixon took a couple bites out of,' and she was surprised and said, 'So, what do you want me to do with it?' So I said, 'Freeze it,' he said. </p>

<p>The half-eaten sandwich has been preserved in this apple sauce jar since September 22, 1960</p>

<p>Jenne was a 14-year-old boy scout when Nixon (left), who was then Vice President, stopped by his small town of Sullivan for a campaign event on September 22, 1960. He says he watched on as Nixon took a few bites from the sandwich</p>

<p>His mother wrapped it in plastic and put it in apple sauce jar before placing it in the freezer. </p>

<p>The half-eaten sandwich has been in Jenne's freezer ever since. </p>

<p>Word of his frozen sandwich caught the attention of the local newspaper and, once they published an article, was picked up by media outlets across the world. </p>

<p>It even earned him an appearance on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson back in 1988.</p>

<p>'As long as I am living, that sandwich will be stored in my freezer in a container that is labeled, 'Save, don't throw away,'' Jenne said. </p>

<p>Jenne is pictured above showing off the preserved sandwich in 2006. Word of his frozen sandwich caught the attention of the local newspaper in the 80s and, once they published an article, was picked up by media outlets across the world</p>
