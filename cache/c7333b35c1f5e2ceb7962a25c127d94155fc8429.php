<p>Boat babe: Mick Jagger's girlfriend Melanie Hamrick, 34, showed off her toned figure in a black bikini as she posed at an unknown location on Instagram on Sunday </p>

<p>Her hair was tied into plaited bunches and she had a big smile on her face for the camera. </p>

<p>Melanie has spent several days holidaying with boyfriend Mick, 76, and their three-year-old son Deveraux as the global COVID-19 lockdown eased.</p>

<p>And she was also in full celebratory mode on Friday, as she took to Instagram to mark her birthday with a pair of sunny snaps.</p>

<p>The former ballerina cut a chic figure in a plunging blue sleeveless dress, which she hiked up to her thigh while striking a pose on a rolling green manicured lawn. </p>

<p>Go Melanie, it's your birthday: Melanie was also in full celebratory mode on Friday, as she took to Instagram to mark her 34th birthday with a pair of sunny snaps</p>

<p>Leaving no room for doubt that it was her special day, the brunette beauty complemented her gown of choice with a sparkly star headband. </p>

<p>Showing she was at one with her surroundings, Melanie appeared to be barefoot as she looked out only the lush green backdrop for her special occasion snaps.</p>

<p>Captioning the images, she wrote: 'It’s a beautiful day to celebrate! ⭐️ Thank you all for the birthday love ❤️ ❤️❤️❤️.'</p>

<p>Happy: Melanie and Mick Jagger, 76, have been together since 2014 (pictured February 2019)</p>

<p>Just the day before, she was spotted looking every inch the doting mum as she took her son Deveraux to the beach to build sandcastles in Lovorno. </p>

<p>The former ballerina – who began dating Rolling Stones icon Mick in 2014 – carried a bucket into the sea as she and Deveraux splashed around during the fun day out.  </p>

<p>In a 2018 interview, Melanie, who retired from ballet in 2020, said of her relationship with British rock legend Mick: 'I don’t think of myself as a "Baby mama"...</p>

<p>'In the technical sense, I’m not married to the father of my child. But I am in a great, wonderful relationship with him. So I don’t see myself like that...</p>

<p>'I dance with one of the most well-known ballet companies in the world. To be put in that category is insulting and it’s insulting to my boyfriend.'</p>

<p>Sir Mick has eight children by five women. His first child, daughter Karis, 47, was a result of a fling with actress and singer Marsha Hunt.</p>

<p>He then went onto have daughter Jade, 46, with his then-wife Bianca.</p>

<p>The Satisfaction hitmaker also has four children with Jerry Hall: daughters Elizabeth, 34, and Georgia, 26, and sons James, 33, and Gabriel, 20.</p>

<p>Mick and Jerry split after it was discovered that he had had an affair with Brazilian model Luciana Gimenez Morad, resulting in Jagger's seventh child, Lucas, 19. </p>

<p>Pride and joy: The happy couple are the proud parents of three-year-old son Deveraux. Legendary rocker Mick is the father of seven other children</p>
