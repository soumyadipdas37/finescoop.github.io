<p>'Regardless of the outcome, this has been one heck of a wild ride and I'm so grateful for the beautiful people I've met along the way and everything I've learnt about myself.'  </p>

<p>Fans are still guessing who will win Locky's heart. The two finalists are Bella and 31-year-old nurse, Irena Srbinovska. </p>

<p>Paparazzi pictures have emerged that prove the brunette spent the night with former Bachelorette star Nathan Favro at the weekend. </p>

<p>One of Bella's neighbours in Sydney spotted Nathan's Toyota HiLux parked outside her home at about 8pm on Saturday night.</p>

<p>The following morning, at about 9:45am, a nervous-looking Nathan, 25, was pictured leaving the apartment and driving away.  </p>

<p>While these photos aren't irrefutable proof that Bella and Nathan are dating - they could be just friends or he could be seeing Bec - they leave little doubt that Bella doesn't win Locky's heart.  </p>

<p>Nathan, however, has repeatedly said the pair are just friends having known each other for a number of years. </p>

<p>According to the latest Sportsbet odds ahead of the finale, Irena is paying out $1.30. While Bella is paying out at $2.95.       </p>
