<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Nigella Lawson has revealed the hack she uses to achieve perfect oil-free fries every time - and fans claim the dish looks 'divine'. </p>

<p>Posting on Instagram, the British TV chef, 60, shared a photograph of her Tuscan fries as she revealed her unorthodox cooking method, which involves using cold oil.</p>

<p>She explained the trick is a 'stress-free' alternative to traditional methods of deep-frying potatoes.</p>

<p>'You'd think it would make them unbearably greasy but in fact you end up with crisp, oil-free fries of utter fabulousness,' Nigella wrote, admitting it seems 'crazy'. </p>

<p>Putting the potatoes in cold oil allows them to cook more slowly meaning the inside have a chance to become soft and fluffy while the outside crisps.  </p>
