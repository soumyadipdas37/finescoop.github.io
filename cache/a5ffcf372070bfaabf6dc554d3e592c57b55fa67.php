<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United have made a shock enquiry for Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante according to reports.</p>

<p>The World Cup winner has been linked with a move to Inter Milan who is managed by former Chelsea head coach Antonio Conte. </p>

<p>But according to the Mirror, Kante could be heading to Old Trafford after the Red Devils contacted his representatives.</p>

<p>Manchester United have made a shock enquiry for Chelsea midfielder N'Golo Kante</p>

<p>Inter chief Piero Ausilio has already ruled out a move for Kante this season because Chelsea are unwilling to listen to offers, leaving a door open for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side.</p>

<p>Conte was keen on a reunion with the Frenchman after the pair won the Premier League together in 2017 but Frank Lampard is determined to hold on to the Frenchman. </p>

<p>The Blues have already rejected an offer which involved Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic and Ausilio claimed the midfielder is too important to Chelsea for the Blues to consider selling him.</p>

<p>Inter Mian have ruled out a move for Kante leaving a door open for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side</p>

<p>'Kante is an important part of Chelsea, I don't think he will be up for sale,' the director explained to DAZN ahead of Inter's Serie A match with Fiorentina on Saturday.</p>

<p>'We have eight important central midfielders, we will begin and move forward with them.'</p>

<p>Kante has started all of Chelsea's three Premier League games and Chelsea would prefer to sell Jorginho ahead of the World Cup winner.</p>

<p>Chelsea are well stocked in midfield themselves and would like to add a younger holding player with West Ham's Declan Rice and Lille's Boubakary Soumare among those fancied by Frank Lampard. </p>

<p>Antonio Conte wanted a reunion with the midfielder after winning the Premier League in 2017</p>

<p>Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Ross Barkley are more likely to be departing Stamford Bridge with Aston Villa eyeing up a loan move for the duo.</p>

<p>Southampton have also shown an interest in Loftus-Cheek, who has been left out of Chelsea's last three fixtures.  </p>

<p>Lampard recognises the club have to consider ways of balancing the books.</p>
