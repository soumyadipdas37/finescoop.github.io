<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disgraced Richard Keys is cashing on the sexist remark which cost him his Sky Sports career to flog personalised videos on Cameo.</p>

<p>The 63-year-old presented Premier League coverage for the broadcaster for two decades before quitting in disgrace nine years ago.</p>

<p>He was recorded off air asking pundit Jamie Redknapp: 'Did you smash it?' about a former girlfriend of the ex-Liverpool and Tottenham star.</p>

<p>It is a crude, slang word for 'sex. He is now flogging selfie clips on the hit video-sharing website.</p>

<p>Richard Keys is cashing on the sexist remark which cost him his career to flog personalised videos on Cameo, using the infamous 'smash it' line to encourage people to buy them</p>

<p>But he is making light of the infamous 'Smash it' line to lure in people to buy them</p>

<p>His Cameo biog it reads: 'Richard Keys, sports presenter.</p>

<p>'Let's 'smash it' together...and have a bit of banter.'</p>

<p>He includes two laughing out loud emojis.</p>

<p>In a video advert on Cameo, Keys - who now presents Qatar-based BeIN Sports footy coverage - said: 'Hi, this is Richard Keys.</p>

<p>'I have absolutely no idea why you would, but if you did want a shout out from me for family, friends, work colleagues, whoever, do please let me know.</p>

<p>'And I would be delighted to accommodate, here on Cameo.</p>

<p>'The best way to get in touch, the only way to get in touch is on Cameo.com</p>

<p>Keys and ex-Sky Sports co-presenter Andy Gray - who also sells videos on Cameo (right) - were also caught making sexist remarks about female assistant referee Sian Massey.</p>

<p>'I look forward to talking with you soon.'</p>

<p>One footy fan - called Jeff - reviewed Keys giving him five stars out of five and said 'Awesome.'</p>

<p>Keys and ex-Sky Sports co-presenter Andy Gray - who also stood down - were also caught making sexist remarks about female assistant referee Sian Massey.</p>

<p>Keys apologised for the 'prehistoric banter' and said: 'Such comments were made off-air to work colleagues, and were, of course, never intended to be broadcast.'</p>

<p>He added that 'If off-air conversations of television and radio presenters were recorded, there would be no one left working. That is not to defend what happened.' </p>

<p>Gray, 64, is also selling videos on Cameo for £58.10 a go.</p>
