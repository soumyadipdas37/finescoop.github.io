<p>Determined to create a tranquil space for study, Simona Galea turned an unused closet in the spare room of her central Queensland home into a trendy work station.</p>

<p>With help from her husband, the mum-of-one covered the back wall with cream panels, pulled out the door frame and slotted a wooden desk - custom made to fit the dimensions - between either side.</p>
