<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two recent successful biopics of famous musicians have both been named for hit songs they sang. </p>

<p>And now Madonna has teased a potential title for the autobiographical film she herself is working on, in the caption to her latest Instagram post.</p>

<p>'Are you ready for the story of my life...✍️' Madge, 62, openly wondered next to a spread of elegant selfies on Friday. 'Am I?' </p>

<p>Live to tell her story: Madonna has teased a potential title for the autobiographical film she herself is working on, in the caption to her latest Instagram post</p>

<p>She added the hashtags #livetotell #diablocody and #screenplay, referring to her Oscar-winning writing partner, Diablo Cody.</p>

<p>The first hashtag, however, referenced her ballad Live To Tell off her third studio album True Blue, a song that went to No. 1 in 1986.  </p>

<p>Judging from last year's Rocketman about Elton John, and the previous year's Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody, it's fair to assume Madonna might be thinking of Live To Tell as the title for her entry in the category. </p>

<p>Lovely: The selfie series showed the Queen Of Pop in black, seated on the white couch she said was becoming an 'appendage' in a previous post</p>

<p>She wore her cat-eye spectacles and handled a lovely dark fan, with colorfully manicured fingers.</p>

<p>She wore fishnet stockings, which got some extra love in one closeup snap.</p>

<p>The Take A Bow hitmaker has been consistently hard at work on the script alongside the Juno and Young Adult scribe, regularly posting to social media with observations and frustrations about the process of telling her life story.</p>

<p>Clearly, the Material Girl wants to do like Elton, 73, and 'Live To Tell' her story in grand Hollywood fashion before she's no longer of this earth.  </p>

<p>Both Rocketman and Bohemian Rhapsody went on to win Oscars, Bohemian for actor Rami Malek, and Rocketman to Elton himself along with longtime lyricist Bernie Taupin, for Original Song I'm Gonna Love Me Again. </p>

<p>Other biopics have gotten substantial acclaim as well as multiple Academy Awards over the years, including Jamie Foxx in 2004's Ray, Marion Cotillard as Edith Piaf in 2007's La Vie En Rose, and Sissy Spacek portraying Loretta Lynn in The Coal Miner's Daughter back in 1980.</p>

<p>It's no wonder Madonna would want to make her best effort with her own unprecedented life story, and perhaps snatch an Oscar of her own.</p>

<p>Her most recent post comes after a prior video post on Madame X's feed, shared September 2nd, that ostensibly confirmed that the project they're working is indeed Madonna's life story. </p>

<p>In that snippet, Madonna begins by joking, 'I'm writing a different script.'</p>

<p>Cody, 42, laughs at this and says, 'What if you're writing someone else's life story, while I write yours?'</p>

<p>The proof wasn't even needed, as it's been clear from the Ray Of Light singer's feed that she's been reminiscing on her life and achievements more than usual of late.</p>

<p>Another recent post showed her Madgesty along with the Juno Academy Award winner looking over Madonna's inflammatory 1992 photobook Sex, during which they wonder what all the fuss was about at the time.</p>

<p>Reading it over: A previous post revealed Madonna's script is very far along, with pages numbering up to 109 already</p>
