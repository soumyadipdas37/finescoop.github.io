<p>Laid-back Sunday: Zoe Kravitz appeared in high spirits, as she enjoyed some fresh air on a solo stroll over the weekend</p>

<p>In addition to a large brown tote on her shoulder, she sported a few unique necklaces and flashed a number of tattoos from her expansive ink collection. </p>

<p>As she kept her distance from crowds or bypassers amid the coronavirus pandemic,  Kravitz kept a cloth black face mask on her wrist and held onto a canned beverage. </p>

<p>While strutting down the sidewalk in her sleek black loafers, the actress was glued to her phone, as she texted and walked with ease. </p>

<p>Looking good: While putting her gym-honed midriff on full display, the 31-year-old actress showed off her trim figure in a tiny white tank top, which she went braless underneath</p>

<p>Last month, she was spotted catching a flight to England out of JFK Airport in New York with her husband Karl Glusman to resume filming The Batman.   </p>

<p>She will portray cat burglar Selina Kyle aka Catwoman in The Batman - which hits US/UK theaters October 1, 2021 - alongside Robert Pattinson, Paul Dano, Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard and Andy Serkis. </p>

<p>After months of isolation, the actress told Vanity Fair she deeply misses her father Lenny Kravitz and mother Lisa Bonet. </p>

<p>Effortlessly chic: The star paired her laid-back ensemble with a pair of form-fitting black trousers and matching retro sunglasses, which are part of her trademark cool-girl style</p>

<p>'First I will go hug all of my family and friends,' she said in June, when asked what she will do when the pandemic is over. </p>

<p>Two weeks ago, Pattinson resumed shooting scenes on The Batman, for the first time after testing positive for COVID-19. </p>

<p>During his absence, the film's production crew reportedly worked 'round the clock' to try and film scenes without him. </p>

<p>The Big Little Lies star, 31, is playing Catwoman in the latest reboot of the super hero franchise, and is concerned about how hair, make-up and wardrobe will be navigated when social distancing is still in place</p>

<p>Amid fears that halting production for two weeks could cost as much as $6.4 million, the film’s director Matt Reeves filmed as much as he could at the Warner Bros. Studio in Leavesden, Hertfordshire, without his leading man. </p>

<p>'Anything that can be shot and does not involved Pattinson will now go ahead,' a set insider told MailOnline, at the time.</p>

<p>The sourced noted: 'That includes scenes with his body double. The aim is to get as much done as possible before he returns and the hope is that none of the other actors get the virus.' </p>

<p>Star-studded cast: She is portraying cat burglar Selina Kyle aka Catwoman in The Batman - hitting US/UK theaters October 1, 2021 - alongside Robert Pattinson, Paul Dano, Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Wright, John Turturro, Peter Sarsgaard, and Andy Serkis </p>

<p>'Crew can be replaced as most are freelance and hired for the duration of the shoot but it would be disastrous if another major actor gets the virus.</p>

<p>‘Production staff are working round the clock to get things moving and allow some filming to take place.’</p>

<p>Sources told Vanity Fair that the thespian contracted the deadly virus just days after production resumed on the big-budget film.</p>

<p>In a statement Warner Bros. told the publication: 'A member of The Batman production has tested positive for Covid-19, and is isolating in accordance with established protocols. Filming is temporarily paused.'</p>
