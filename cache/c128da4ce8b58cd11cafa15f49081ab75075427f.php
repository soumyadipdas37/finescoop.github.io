<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The government is set to apply the breaks on the timeline for fans returning to sport next month, with as little as 1,000 spectators allowed back to stadiums instead of the initial plans for up to 30 per cent of a venue.  </p>

<p>Provisional guidelines were in place for restrictions to be lifted at elite sporting events from October 1, allowing up to 30 per cent of supporters back to watch live sport.</p>

<p>However, according to The Times, the number permitted now is set to be heavily diluted to around 1,000 - 2,500.</p>

<p>Clubs are set to allow just 1,000 fans back into stadiums next month rather than 30 per cent</p>

<p>A number of test events have been held to trial a socially-distanced return of supporters</p>

<p>A letter written to Conservative MP and former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch from Nigel Huddleston of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport underlined the hope to continue with plans to open up sporting events for a small number of spectators on October 1.</p>

<p>There has been a dramatic upturn in Covid-19 cases across the country in the last fortnight, with cases in the United Kingdom passing 3,000 a day at one point last week.</p>

<p>In response, the government unveiled their much-maligned 'rule of six' to restrict gatherings, but this doesn't apply as stringently in public venues where there is extra room for people to gather. This is where sports teams are hopeful they can still get people back into venues.</p>

<p>There have been a number of test events with spectators returning to sport from friendly matches in football's pre-season to snooker at The Crucible and cricket matches at The Oval and Edgbaston.</p>

<p>Snooker fans were also allowed back to the Crucible earlier this year as part of a trial event</p>

<p>Clubs across the world of sport are taking a major financial hit by playing their respective fixtures without fans in attendance.</p>

<p>'I know how important this is for sports clubs for whom paying spectators are vital,' Huddleston wrote to Crouch.  </p>

<p>The Times say that in the Premier League, Tottenham and Aston Villa are particularly frustrated that plans for fans coming back could now be restricted to just 1,000. </p>
