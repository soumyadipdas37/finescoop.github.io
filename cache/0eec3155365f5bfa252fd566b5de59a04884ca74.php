<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>When you think of lasagne, you are likely to picture stacks of pasta coated in a rich tomato sauce and lashings of melted cheese.</p>

<p>So perhaps it's no wonder that Sydney baker Walla Abu-Eid's reinvention of the classic Italian dinner as a decadent, cheesecake-style dessert has attracted widespread attention on social media.</p>

<p>So keen is the interest that the 31-year-old mother-of-three - whose cakes have garnered an Instagram following of 83,300 - has now revealed the simple recipe for her viral creation, which has been shared by more than 60 global news outlets.</p>

<p>In a video filmed for Instagram TV, Ms Abu-Eid - who learned to bake on Google and YouTube and says 'anyone can do the same' - showed viewers how to make their own with five ingredients: sugar, cream, vanilla extract, Lotus Biscoff spread and biscuits.</p>

<p>To make the filling, Ms Abu-Eid mixes a carton of thickened cream with a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of vanilla extract, whipping until 'soft peaks' form in the mixture.</p>

<p>It should be thick and slightly stiff without being over beaten, which causes the cream to curdle.</p>

<p>Next, she heats a jar of Biscoff spread in the microwave for 30 seconds to soften – and then gets down to assembling the dessert.</p>

<p>She drizzles some melted Biscoff spread over the cream, then repeats the process three times, ending with a layer of cream on top.</p>

<p>Fans have branded Ms Abu-Eid's sweet lasagne a 'work of art' and a 'culinary masterpiece' on social media</p>

<p>Scooping any remaining spread into a piping bag, she pipes thin lines onto the cream and runs through them with a skewer or toothpick, creating an ornate triangular pattern.</p>

<p>Finally, she crumbles leftover biscuits into fine crumbs and sprinkles them around the edge of the dish for decoration.</p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia in July, Ms Abu-Eid said her swift success on social media has been 'crazy'.</p>

<p>'People tell me my cakes look so professional, but I really just do it as a hobby whenever I have time,' she said.</p>

<p>Asked if she had secured a paid partnership with Lotus to promote the brand, the baker laughed and said a collaboration like that would be a dream come true.</p>

<p>'I wish I had a deal with Biscoff, I just love the flavour. I actually did contact them, but no word yet!' she said.</p>

<p>The baked dessert (pictured) is made from six simple ingredients: eggs, cream cheese, sugar, butter flour and vanilla extract</p>

<p>On the back of the extraordinary baking craze that's swept Australia and the rest of the world since the coronavirus crisis began, Ms Abu-Eid shared tips and tricks for first-timers looking to step into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Patience and practice are crucial, she says, but there's no need to enroll in expensive courses.</p>

<p>'I didn't go to any academy or take any classes, [I learned] from the internet - lots of Googling, reading blogs and watching YouTube,' she said.</p>

<p>'I'd look at clips over and over until I'd gotten everything I could from each one, then move on to the next.'</p>

<p>Ms Abu-Eid never lets herself run out of five staple ingredients - eggs, butter, sugar, flour and vanilla extract - which she says forms the base for almost every cake.</p>

<p>While she's content to keep baking as a much-loved hobby rather than a full-time business, Ms Abu-Eid hopes to pass her skills to at least one her three young daughters.</p>

<p>'My second girl Masa is very interested, she's always asking to help in the kitchen,' she said.</p>

<p>'We went to the toy store last weekend and she picked a baking set because she said she wants to be just like mum!'</p>

<p>Whether she follows in those footsteps remains to be seen, but it's clear that Masa and her sisters are exceptionally lucky to have a teacher as gifted as their mother.</p>
