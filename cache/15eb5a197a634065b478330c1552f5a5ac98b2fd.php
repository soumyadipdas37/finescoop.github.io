<p>Since starring on the 2019 season, Martha has launched a new career as a brand ambassador and social media influencer. </p>

<p>Last month Martha ensured all eyes were on her yet again when she posted a steamy naked selfie. </p>

<p>The beauty blogger flaunted her incredible curves while posing in front of her bathroom mirror after getting out of the shower. </p>

<p>Is this her raciest post yet? Last month Martha surprised her fans as she flaunted her sensational curves as she went completely naked after a steamy shower </p>
