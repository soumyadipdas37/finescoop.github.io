<p>And Leomie Anderson looked sensational as she walked the outdoor runway during Burberry's London Fashion Week September show on Thursday which was streamed to audiences.</p>

<p>Work it: Leomie Anderson looked sensational as she modelled leather dungarees and a matching jacket in the Burberry show during London Fashion Week on Thursday</p>

<p>Leomie commanded attention as she strutted along the forrest-themed catwalk which celebrated the 'freedom of the British outdoors' in a pair of leather boots.</p>

<p>She continued the chic look with a leather jacket which boasted zips on the sleeves and a studded pattern around the edges.</p>

<p>The beauty's look stood out from the other models in the show, with many others donning a bright blue colour or crisp white t-shirts with graphic designs on. </p>

<p>Bold: A bright blue colour was a theme throughout the Burberry LFW show, with one model donning a striking trench coat with thigh-high leather boots</p>

<p>Iconic: The Burberry trench was reimagined for the Spring/Summer 2021 collection with some models wearing one covered with a blue design (left) and others having denim on (right)</p>

<p>The fashion house was displaying Riccardo Tisci’s Spring/Summer 2021 collection, called In Bloom, during the show.</p>

<p>Vibrant blue tones filled the catwalk, with models wearing the bold colour as trousers, trench coats and shorts.</p>

<p>Explaining some of the design features, Burberry said the performance was conceived by Riccardo Tisci and artist Anne Imhof before being staged for a digital audience.</p>

<p>Fashion: A male model's jumper featured cut outs between the striped blue and black fabric</p>

<p>Stand out: Others wore white ensembles with colourful pictures across their graphic tees</p>

<p>Speaking about the show, Tisci said: ‘As humans, we have always had a deep affinity to nature. We have had to respect and rely upon its power for our very existence, whilst marvelling and revelling in its extraordinary beauty. </p>

<p>'Especially recently, we have all yearned to reconnect again. For this show, I wanted to celebrate these feelings by bringing our community together in a creative experience that takes place within the beautiful, natural landscape of Britain.’ </p>

<p>In line with Burberry's previous two runway shows, the outdoor experience will be certified carbon neutral. </p>

<p>Style: A pair of cut out leather trousers were worn over white leggings by another stunning model as she worked the catwalk</p>

<p>London Fashion Week has managed to go ahead despite the coronavirus pandemic, with organisers having to make changes and adhere to social distancing.</p>

<p>The schedule will see over 80 designers including 40 womenswear, 15 menswear, 20 menswear &amp; womenswear and 5 accessories brands, according to the LFW website. </p>

<p>There will be a total of 50 digital only activations, 21 physical and digital, 7 physical only and 3 designers who will activate through a physical evening event only.</p>

<p>Bold: One model rocked an all blue look with a black fish-net style top peaking out from under the tailored coat</p>

<p>All together: Several of the models wore the leather hats in a group shot (Leomie is seen second from the right at the front)</p>

<p>While earlier this year Victoria's Secret announced that Leomie was among a small group of models who were given the coveted title of a Victoria's Secret Angel.</p>

<p>In an Instagram post she wrote: 'Mate I am still in shock... this is something I was even scared to dream about because I never thought it would come true but I am insanely excited to announce that I am Victoria's Secret's newest ANGEL!! I can't even believe it..."</p>

<p>She has modelled for the American brand since 2015. Leomie's showbiz pals were quick to congratulate the model, taking to the comments section of the post to offer their well-wishes. </p>

<p>Leomie, who has joined Candice Swanepoel and Behati Prinsloo in the prestigious group of models, began her modelling career in 2010 and her first show was for Marc Jacobs, while she is also the face of Rihanna's Fenty Beauty line. </p>

<p>Ambience: Burberry filmed the show in a forrest and used cameras on tracks to record it for their virtual audience</p>
