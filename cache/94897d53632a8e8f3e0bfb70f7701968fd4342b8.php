<p>The Hammers are testing the three-part Gateway Personal Protection Tunnel at their Chadwell Heath training base that is used by their development squad, U18s and women’s team.</p>

<p>The tunnel is similar to an airport scanner that people walk through. In the first part, a thermal imaging camera is used to record the person’s temperature.</p>

<p>They then move on to have their clothes lightly sprayed with a non-alcoholic, water-based sanitiser which neutralises bacteria and viruses before proceeding through the rest of the tunnel.</p>

<p>The tunnel, devised by CovProtex, will be used alongside existing safety measures already being implemented by clubs to reduce the spread of coronavirus. </p>

<p>The trial remains in the early stages and how soon it could be rolled out and tested at football grounds has yet to be decided.</p>
