<p>It comes as most provinces in Canada are easing lockdown restrictions and schools are beginning to reopen for in-person classes. </p>

<p>Canada's infection figures saw a mild increase in recent days, with authorities on high alert to avoid new outbreaks of Covid.</p>

<p>Some provinces, including British Columbia, even imposed new curbs to tackle the spread of the virus amid the uptake. </p>

<p>But across the border in the United States, more than 190,000 people have died from the pandemic and more than 6.38million people have been infected.</p>

<p>Canada's first recorded case of coronavirus was in Toronto on January 25.</p>

<p>Both Ontario, the country's most populous province, and neighbouring Quebec turned into the hot spots for COVID-19 infections. </p>

<p>The provinces both struggles with outbreaks in long-term care homes, with Canada's first death from Covid being reported on March 9 at a British Columbia long-term care facility.</p>

<p>But Canada's experience dealing with SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2002-2003 helped health officials to be better prepared for the pandemic.</p>

<p>SARS killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that outbreak.</p>

<p>Canada shut its international borders to all foreign nationals and ramped up tests to isolate infected patients when Covid cases began to spike in mid-March.  </p>

<p>Ontario and Alberta faced outbreaks among temporary foreign workers on farms and meat-processing plants, which slowed reopening in certain regions.</p>
