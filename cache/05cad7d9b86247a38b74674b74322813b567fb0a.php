<p>Crowds are defying social distancing measures at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park to get a glimpse of Chico (pictured), a nine-year-old yellow-crowned amazon parrot</p>

<p>The talented bird can also mimic other pop tracks including Poker Face by Lady Gaga, Firework by Katy Perry and You Drive Me Crazy by Gnarls Barkley.</p>

<p>Lincolnshire Wildlife Park CEO Steve Nichols said: 'After more than 25 years working with these amazing birds, they still never cease to amaze me.</p>
