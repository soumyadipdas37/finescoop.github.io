<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona are reportedly confident they will sign Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum before the October transfer deadline day.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman has made the Dutchman a top target, having built a strong rapport with him from the time he was in charge of the national team.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum has entered the final year of his contract at Anfield, and Liverpool are reportedly reluctant to lose him for nothing next summer and could be backed into a corner over their man. </p>

<p>Georginio Wijnaldum could be set to leave Liverpool and join Ronald Koeman at Barcelona</p>

<p>Goal have now reported that given the circumstances, the Blaugrana are confident they can lure Wijnaldum to the Nou Camp before the deadline of October 5.   </p>

<p>Koeman is determined to sign the 29-year-old as he looks to freshen up the team after a disastrous 2019-20 campaign.</p>

<p>Barcelona have not yet put an offer in for Wijnaldum as they look to sell before bringing any players in.</p>

<p>Ivan Rakitic has already departed to Sevilla, while Arturo Vidal is set to join Inter Milan and Luis Suarez looks likely to join Juventus.</p>

<p>There has been no sign from Wijnaldum, either, that he is unsettled or wants to agitate for a move but there is little doubt that Barcelona want to add his experience as they begin the process of rebuilding in the wake of their Champions League calamity.</p>

<p>Wijnaldum didn't give away much when he asked about the move ahead of the Netherlands' clash with Poland saying: 'It’s a rumour, I have nothing to say about it.'</p>

<p>Koeman is a big fan of Wijnaldum from his days working as the Dutch national manager</p>

<p>Since his arrival from Newcastle in 2016, only Roberto Firmino has played more Premier League minutes than Wijnaldum.</p>

<p>In that time he has made 187 appearances and won the Champions League and Premier League. </p>

<p>Given his standing in the squad at Liverpool, they would look to recoup the £25m fee they spent on Wijnaldum. Should they do that, it would then pave the way for a move for Thiago.</p>

<p>The Spain midfielder has his heart set on moving to Anfield. He is in a similar contractual position to Wijnaldum, in that he has entered the last 12 months and Bayern Munich have made it clear they want £30m for him.</p>
