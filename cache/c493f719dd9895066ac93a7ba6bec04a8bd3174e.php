<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jeremy Scott has been dubbed a 'creative genius' for using puppets to showcase his latest collection amid ongoing social distancing restrictions.</p>

<p>The fashion designer, who lives in Los Angeles, collaborated with The Muppet's Jim Henson's Creature Shop to create 30-inch marionettes and the set for his fashion show, while his atelier crafted the Moschino's Spring/Summer 2021 collection into scaled down outfits. </p>

<p>The show was broadcast in a short film, with Jeremy telling British Vogue that the project was 'a labour of love.'</p>

<p>He explained: 'It’s much easier to do a show with live models and put clothes on them in a traditional size, turn the music on – and go. I directed the film, it was my concept, so to make it all happen in this timely fashion has been one of the most amazing and challenging creative endeavours that I’ve ever gone on.' </p>

<p>Designer Jeremy Scott has been praised for collaborating with The Muppet's Jim Henson's Creature Shop to create 30 inch puppets to model Moschino's Spring/Summer 2021 collection at Milan Fashion Week</p>

<p>Jeremy has known some of the puppeteers behind his film since the mid-2000s, having worked with the famous puppet studio on iconic characters including Miss Piggy. </p>

<p>Amid on-going restrictions over fashion weeks around the world, the designer had bespoke items made for the audience of his catwalk show as well as miniature Moschino pieces for the models. </p>

<p>He explained that he tried to put a twist on the clothing, with magazine editors Edward Enninful and Anna Wintour among those seated in his audience. </p>

<p>Designs by worn by 30-inch models include sweeping ball gowns, corsetry and pastel colours. </p>

<p>HERES A SNEAK PEEK BEHIND THE CURTAIN OF THE MAKING OF MY FILM FOR MOSCHINO !</p>

<p>A post shared by  Jeremy Scott (<?php echo e('@'); ?>itsjeremyscott) on Sep 26, 2020 at 9:54am PDT</p>

<p>The fashion designer, who lives in Los Angeles, revealed his catwalk show aims to temporarily suspend reality and help people forget their sorrows. Pictured: Puppets in miniature Moschino clothing </p>

<p>While all the work on the miniature garments was done by hand, the ball gowns will be available in scaled up versions for sales, </p>

<p>Jeremy revealed that he thinks of his fashion shows as a form of escapism, similar to those who chose to spend their pennies on going to the cinema at the time of the Depression era in America.</p>

<p>Explaining the aims of his latest collection, he said that film has always been a way for people to escape from their sorrows.</p>

<p>He said: 'There, they were transfixed by Jean Harlow slithering across the screen – so transported perhaps that just for a moment, they forgot their sorrows. </p>

<p>Each garment worn by the puppets was crafted by hand, and will be scaled up for the spring/summer collection by the fashion house </p>

<p>'So, if I can transform that reality, suspend it for just a moment, so that my guests are transfixed by the show – that’s my goal. I feel like it is more important and pertinent and necessary more than ever.' </p>

<p>Both Moschino and the fashion designer's Instagram accounts have been flooded with comments from impressed followers of fashion.</p>

<p>Sharing a photograph of some of the puppets, Moschino re-posted a review penned by Vogue Mexico: 'If anyone reinvented the way to present a runway, that has been #JeremyScott through his most recent parade for Moschino at #MFW. </p>

<p>'Theatrically and originality are not alien to the creative spirit of this designer, who opted for puppets and custom pieces for his runway. Bold dresses, romantic pieces and maximalist details were seen under other eyes.' </p>

<p>A stream of Instagram users have dubbed Jeremy a 'genius' and gushed about the 'beautiful' clothing that featured in the catwalk show </p>

<p>In response, one person wrote: 'Now this is art! What a creative an iconic way to show your collection.' </p>

<p>Another said: 'Absolutely genius. Thank you for inspiring us to think differently. Loved every second.'</p>

<p>A third added: 'Bravo! What a stunning way to show your collection and what a creatively human expression.'  </p>

<p>Jeremy (pictured, with his puppets) said he often thinks of people going to watch films during the Depression era, when putting together his fashion shows </p>
