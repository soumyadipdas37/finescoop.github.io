<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Medical students will be prioritised for face-to-face teaching amid local coronavirus outbreaks, the Government revealed yesterday.</p>

<p>Universities should only retain in-person provision for 'priority courses' if there is an upsurge in the disease with online learning increased in other subjects.</p>

<p>And students must not return to their family home if stricter measures become necessary to curb the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>The updated guidance – published yesterday – comes as thousands prepare to return to campus for the start of term.</p>

<p>Jo Grady, of the University and College Union, called the advice, which included using outdoor space during teaching, 'confusing, expensive and, at times, silly'.</p>

<p>Universities minister Michelle Donelan said safety 'is our priority'.</p>

<p>Currently, universities should identify an 'appropriate' mix of online and face-to-face teaching for each subject, reflecting what will maximise learning and mimimise transmission risks.</p>

<p>Universities should only retain in-person provision for 'priority courses' if there is an upsurge in the disease with online learning increased in other subjects</p>

<p>Vice chancellors should ensure 'good ventilation' in classes and 'increase the supply of fresh air, for example, by opening windows and doors'.</p>

<p>The document also highlights 'utilising outdoor space', which could involve tutorials being held in the grounds of campuses.</p>

<p>It says: 'You might consider whether some tuition in certain subjects can be conducted outside.'</p>

<p>Universities should consider 'segmentation' of students, for example by course, year group and accommodation to help 'reduce the potential size of outbreaks'.</p>

<p>'Use of segments also mean that certain classes or student households could be quarantined instead of wider groups, minimising wider disruption,' the guidance says.</p>

<p>Students should be kept two metres apart from people they do not live with, 'where possible'.</p>

<p>When this is not possible, 'a minimum of 1 metre can be used but only if appropriate mitigation is in place'.</p>

<p>Smaller teaching groups should be used, where it is not possible to maintain social distancing.</p>

<p>This could involve 'reducing the size of casts in drama, the size of orchestras, or the number of students involved in movement sessions'.</p>

<p>Where social distancing cannot be adhered to, the university could 'consider using booths, barriers or screens between individuals who are not part of a teaching group, between teaching groups and others, and between performers and any staff or students not participating at that moment'.</p>

<p>Face masks should be worn 'where social distancing is difficult to maintain outside of teaching situations, such as in corridors and communal areas'.</p>

<p>Universities minister Michelle Donelan said safety 'is our priority'</p>

<p>They can be used in workshops, labs, offices, libraries and teaching rooms which suffer ventilation and social distancing challenges as long as they do not 'interfere with teaching and learning'.</p>

<p>In addition, coverings are 'likely to be appropriate in many social settings, including any events hosted by student clubs and societies'.</p>

<p>Staff and other students can watch performing arts rehearsals and shows but should 'avoid cheering or shouting'.</p>

<p>Universities 'might consider mitigating actions, such as the use of screens to protect audience members where necessary or the use of face coverings'.</p>

<p>Institutions should also consider changing timetables so arrivals and departures on campus are staggered and discourage students from using public transport.</p>

<p>The advice adds that universities should base their plans for local outbreaks on a four-tier system of restrictions.</p>

<p>Blended learning - a mix of face-to-face tuition and online lessons - has been recommended as the 'default position' when campuses reopen this month.</p>

<p>Tier two - described as the 'fallback' position - advises that universities should move to an increased level of online learning where possible.</p>

<p>Tier three - where stricter measures are needed - calls for institutions only to retain face-to-face provision for priority courses such as clinical and medical courses and 'in as limited number of situations as possible'.</p>

<p>At this stage, it says students should not return to their family home to 'reduce the risk of transmitting the virus through travel'.</p>

<p>The last resort would be for university buildings to close to everyone except key workers and for the majority of provision to shift online.</p>

<p>It comes after Government scientific advisers warned that significant outbreaks of coronavirus linked to universities are 'highly likely' and they risk amplifying the transmission of the disease across the country.</p>

<p>A paper by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), published on Friday, warned such outbreaks could coincide with Christmas and pose 'a significant risk; to extended families.</p>
