<p>Derek Robinson, 48, was greeted by emotional family and friends - including his grandson Hurricane - on Thursday afternoon.</p>

<p>He and his mate Tony Higgins, 57, had made contact with authorities just hours earlier after hope was all but lost for their survival.</p>

<p>They vanished one day into a trip to Goolwa, from Coffin Bay near Port Lincoln, on Thursday, September 3.</p>

<p>After far reaching air and water searches yielded no results, authorities called off the search on Wednesday evening, fearing the worst.</p>

<p>Derek Robinson, 48, was greeted by emotional family and friends - including his grandson Hurricane - on Thursday afternoon</p>

<p>Mr Robinson told SBS he was feeling 'very emotional' when he got back on land. </p>

<p>'I knew I'd see my boys again but I just didn't know when. I'm glad to be back and I'm on steady ground - but it just feels like my legs are wobbling all over the place,' he said as a beer was handed to him.</p>

<p>He told reporters that he felt he needed to take the voyage for 'personal reasons', and he needed 'to get away'.   </p>

<p>While he never necessarily feared for his life while lost at sea, Mr Robinson admitted there were definitely 'scary moments', 'like when you see big waves coming at you'.</p>

<p>However he said they were 'good fun' and 'all part of the adventure.'</p>

<p>'It was rough, it was rocky... I don't think I felt scared - just isolated. It felt like the world didn't exist, because we were out in the middle of nowhere,' he said. </p>

<p>'There was no signal, no service. You'd think they'd have service out there - technology and all. My phone was b******d the whole way through.'</p>

<p>Mr Robinson embraces friends and family on Thursday after being rescued from his broken fishing boat  </p>

<p>Mr Robinson's brother Ian told The Advertiser he was 'happy as a pig in sh*t' with the outcome. </p>

<p>'I've never been happier, my brother is alive,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am happy as a pig in sh*t. I was losing the plot for the last couple of days. (But) I was not giving up until there was a body, debris, or a boat.</p>

<p>'The anxiety and pain you go through, I wouldn't wish upon my worst enemy. It's been emotional.' </p>

<p>Mr Robinson and Mr Higgins were just a day into their trip when they experienced engine trouble on Friday last week. </p>

<p>The pair managed to contact a friend to inform them their plans had changed and they would be diverting to nearby Kangaroo Island.</p>

<p>But they had not been heard from since. </p>

<p>The men were headed to Goolwa, from Coffin Bay near Port Lincoln, they told a friend they would try make it to Kangaroo Island after their engine failed but ended up in Salt Creek</p>

<p>Mr Robinson moved on to a rescue boat and was whisked to safety while Mr Higgins stayed behind with his own boat, which had become waterlogged</p>

<p>A massive search operation was launched, involving police, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority and members of the Royal Australian Air Force. </p>

<p>Crews spent days searching an area larger than Tasmania covered in an attempt to find the men.</p>

<p>Fears were raised when the men were still not located after several weather warnings and days of treacherous conditions. </p>

<p>On Wednesday night the aerial search was called off after rescue teams failed to find any sign of the men.</p>

<p>'After searching around 104,000 square kilometres, Australian and Maritime Safety Authority advised us last night that they would be suspending any further sea search,' Superintendent Bahr said on Wednesday night.</p>

<p>Mr Robinson moved on to a rescue boat and was whisked to safety while Mr Higgins stayed behind with his own boat, which had become waterlogged</p>

<p>'They have checked every part of the area with no sign of the vessel. The decision has been made, that if nothing comes from tonight we will also suspended any further search activities.'</p>

<p>However, hours later a call came through informing the rescue team the men had managed to raise the alarm. </p>

<p>They had somehow managed to contact their families and Victor Harbour police station to tell them they were still alive.</p>

<p>The men were in a newly purchased 10-metre wooden-hulled boat, which they were planning on fixing up.</p>

<p>Alexandrina Mayor Keith Parkes, who is a former commodore of the Goolwa Regatta Yacht Club, said the pair were lucky to be alive.</p>

<p>He told the ABC they were in 'treacherous waters'.</p>

<p>'We just can't believe how lucky they are to have been found.'</p>

<p>Mr Robinson managed to alert crews that he was still alive just hours after they called off a search</p>
