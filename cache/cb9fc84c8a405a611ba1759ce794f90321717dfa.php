<p>Last week Kerry surprised fans with the news that she was engaged to boyfriend of two years Ryan.</p>

<p>Sensational: In one snap Kerry slipped into taupe knitted loungewear as she posed in front of her bedroom</p>

<p>The singer couldn't contain her shock and fell to the ground once she realised what Ryan had up his sleeve.</p>

<p>'Are you mad? Are you sure? You know my track record right? I can't believe it', the mother-of-five said in reference to her tumultuous romance history.</p>

<p>Kerry married Westlife's Brian McFadden, 40, in 2002, but he filed for divorce in 2004 and embarked on a seven-year relationship with Australian singer Delta Goodrem shortly after. </p>

<p>The former couple's divorce was finalised in 2006, before the mother-of-five went on to tie the knot to taxi driver Mark Croft, 49, on Valentine's Day in 2007. </p>

<p>They split just two years later, and Kerry was married to George Kay from 2014 until 2017, who sadly died from an overdose last year aged 39.</p>

<p>She raises children Molly, 18, and Lilly-Sue, 17, with Brian, while she shares Heidi, 13, and Max, 12, with second spouse Mark and had Dylan-Jorge, six, with former sports star George.</p>
