<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea are reportedly planning one final move to sign Declan Rice - and could sell Jorginho to Arsenal to facilitate a deal.</p>

<p>Frank Lampard is a big admirer of the England international and has not given up hope of landing him this summer despite West Ham insisting he is not for sell.   </p>

<p>According to The Mirror, Chelsea will make a last-ditch attempt to bring in midfielder Rice and Jorginho could end up being the fall guy.</p>

<p>Chelsea will make one final attempt to persuade West Ham to part with Declan Rice</p>

<p>Frank Lampard is a huge admirer of Rice and is hopeful he can sign him before the deadline</p>

<p>Arsenal have an interest in the Italian with Mikel Arteta keen to bolster his midfield ranks. </p>

<p>Atletico Madrid's Thomas Partey and Lyon star Houssem Aouar remain the prime targets but Jorginho could be a cheaper and more realistic option.</p>

<p>Arsenal aren't currently in a position to sign Aouar despite reportedly agreeing personal terms with the player. </p>

<p>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has already expressed his doubts over Arsenal's capability to finance a deal for the £54million-rated Frenchman.</p>

<p>If Arteta can't raise the funds, Jorginho is a player he will likely turn to but Chelsea will only allow him to leave if they can strike an agreement with West Ham for Rice.</p>

<p>Chelsea could allow Jorginho to move to Arsenal if they can agree a deal for Rice</p>

<p>Arsenal are keen on Lyon's Houssem Aouar but may not be able to afford a deal for him</p>

<p>The Hammers have made their reluctance to part with the 21-year-old clear but may be tempted to sell should they receive a huge offer.</p>

<p>Lampard was asked directly about potentially signing Rice this week but chose to remain coy on the subject.</p>

<p>'Every player would always be a case by case situation. One where there is a happy solution for myself, the player and the club,' the Chelsea boss said. </p>

<p>'So yes we have a big squad, we know that but at the moment the players remain ours and we'll see as time goes on.</p>

<p>'It's not my position to speculate on what may be because it's not my job. And it's the same for players at other clubs. We have a game against West Brom and my biggest thing is getting the squad ready for that game.' </p>
