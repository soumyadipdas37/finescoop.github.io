<p>The 1964 Monte Carlo-rally winning Cooper S catapulted the Mini to iconic status and made Hopkirk a household name</p>

<p>Like the original, the 100 celebration cars will don the now-famous '37' racing number on the driver's and passenger's doors</p>

<p>Paddy Hopkirk and co-driver Henry Liddon are the most recent all-British crew to have won the legendary Monte Carlo Rally</p>

<p>The surprise win in Monte Carlo made Paddy Hopkirk the UK's most famous rally driver overnight and the classic Mini advanced from outsider and crowd pleaser to becoming a motor racing legend, with the Mini's feat repeated in 1965 and 1967 in the hands of Hopkirk's Finnish team mates Timo Mäkinen and Rauno Aaltonen.</p>

<p>The victory made Hopkirk a household name and his achievement saw him receive telegrams from the then UK Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home and the Beatles.</p>

<p>He was also given the Freedom of the City of Belfast, and appeared along with his Mini on Sunday Night at the London Palladium with Bruce Forsyth and was interviewed by the BBC's Raymond Baxter.</p>

<p>In the style of the historic rally winner, the edition model features a single white bonnet stripe on the driver's side which bears the signature of the 1964 racing driver</p>

<p>The car will likely appeal to Mini and rally fans and should have future-classic status given its very limited production output</p>

<p>The commemorative 2020 model is based on the standard Cooper S, which costs from £20,335 in the lowest specification, meaning a mark-up of more than £7,000 - a premium of 35 per cent.</p>

<p>The rally-winner's famous number plate - '33 EJB' -  is also shown on the bonnet strip using 3D effect graphics.</p>

<p>Shortly after winning the race, Hopkirk was invited to appear - with his race car - on Sunday Night at the London Palladium</p>

<p>Mechanically, the Cooper S remains unchanged. That means it has a 2.0-litre, 4-cylinder, petrol engine producing 192 horsepower, mated to a manual gearbox</p>
