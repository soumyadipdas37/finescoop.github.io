<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An early morning rescue mission will be launched to save a pod of 270 whales stranded on a sandbar off Tasmania's remote west coast.</p>

<p>Around 25 of the pilot whales are believed to have already died after the large pod became stuck on Monday morning. </p>

<p>Marine conservation experts made a mercy dash to Macquarie Harbour near Strahan after they were alerted to the pod spread across two sandbars and a beach at Macquarie Heads.</p>

<p>Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water staff and Tasmania Police were on site to assist as marine experts assessed the incident. </p>

<p>The desperate rescue effort continues to save a massive pod of whales (pictured) who became stranded on a sandbar at Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania on Monday morning</p>

<p>Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service manager Nic Deka, said marine specialists had to complete a thorough assessment before rescue efforts could start.</p>

<p>'When we start making an effort (on Tuesday) morning it will be with an outward-going tide,' he told reporters.</p>

<p>'That will be in our favour. We'll be aiming to make the most of that window.'</p>

<p>A plan was drawn up on Monday night after specialist crews arrive in Strahan from Hobart.</p>

<p>Strahan resident Georgia Grining told AAP the whales were quite distressed.</p>

<p>Of the 270 pilot whales believed to be stranded (pictured), around 25 have sadly already died </p>

<p>One of the groups is stranded about 100 metres from a boat ramp.</p>

<p>'(They were) flapping around and obviously trying to get themselves off the sandbar. It's not very nice,' she said.</p>

<p>Mr Deka said whale beachings in Tasmania were not uncommon but there hadn't been one of this size on the west coast for a decade.</p>

<p>Authorities are asking people to keep their distance.</p>

<p>'These are big animals, those that are untrained in managing these incidents can be at risk,' Mr Deka said.</p>

<p>Marine experts are assessing the situation with further updates expected throughout the day</p>

<p>Whale rescue equipment is being transported from Hobart.</p>

<p>Tasmania is the only state in the country where mass groups of whales and dolphins regularly become stranded, according to the DIPIPWE. </p>

<p>Reasons include misadventure, disorientation caused by shallow waterways or rough seas, or even flight response when in contact with a superior species. </p>

<p>Long-finned pilot whales are most frequently involved in mass strandings in Tasmania.   </p>
