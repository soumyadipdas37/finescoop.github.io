<p>Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the country's economy shrank 7 per cent in the three months to the end of June having contracted by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year.</p>

<p>It was the biggest decline in quarterly GDP since records began in 1959 and signalled Australia's first recession since 1991. </p>

<p>Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed the country's economy shrank 7 per cent in the three months to the end of June having contracted by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter</p>

<p>A host of countries – including the UK, US and Germany – have also plunged into recession in the wake of the Covid- 19 outbreak.</p>

<p>'This crisis is like no other,' said Australia's treasurer and Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Josh Frydenberg. </p>

<p>'Our record run of 28 consecutive years of economic growth has now officially come to an end.'</p>

<p>Australia was the only major economy to avoid a recession during the 2008 global financial crisis, mainly due to demand from China for its natural resources.</p>

<p>But Frydenberg told Australians that 'we have your back'.</p>

<p>The politician said: 'We will be with you through this crisis and all the way out of this crisis.'</p>

<p>More than a million people have lost their jobs since March when Australia shut down entire sectors of the economy, hitting private sector demand and investments. </p>

<p>The government did step up with more than A$300billion of stimulus, though the gloomy data underlines the need for more stimulus. </p>

<p>'The path back from the Covid-19 recession will be protracted,' said Sarah Hunter, chief economist for BIS Oxford Economics. 'We expect it to take until early 2022 for activity to return to prepandemic levels.'</p>
