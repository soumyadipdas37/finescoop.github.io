<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Today host Karl Stefanovic is no stranger to being caught off-guard by hilarious unpredictable moments on live TV.</p>

<p>And on Wednesday, the 46-year-old was left red faced after an on-air gaffe during a wildlife segment.</p>

<p>He and co-host Allison Langdon were speaking to ecologist and bird expert Dr Gráinne Cleary about magpies and why they swoop on people and other animals. </p>

<p>'That's a bit rude!' Today host Karl Stefanovic lost it after a wildlife ecologist's hilarious on-air gaffe. Pictured left to right is Karl, Ally and Dr Gráinne Cleary</p>

<p>Karl concluded the interview by asking Dr Cleary: 'If I was a bird, what kind of bird would I be do you think?'</p>

<p>'That's an interesting one...' she replied. 'Maybe a bit of a kookaburra I think for some reason?'</p>

<p>Dr Cleary's Irish accent surprised Karl, who was baffled by her pronunciation of the word kookaburra.</p>

<p>The lead up: Karl and co-host Allison Langdon talked to wildlife ecologist Dr Gráinne Cleary about magpies. He rounded out the interview by asking her: 'If I was a bird, what kind of bird would I be do you think?' She said that Karl seemed like a Kookaburra</p>

<p>'A what? Cock-a-burra?' he laughed. 'That's a bit rude!'</p>

<p>Fortunately, the joke was not lost on Dr Cleary, who clarified that she meant kookaburra and wasn't offended by Karl mishearing her.</p>

<p>The hilarious moment comes as the Today show finally catches up with Channel Seven's Sunrise in the ratings. </p>

<p>Lost in communication: But it appeared that Dr Cleary's  (right) Irish accent got the better of Karl who heard differently. 'A what? Cockaburra?' the TV presenter laughed. The hilarity of the situation was not lost on the bird expert who was also left in stitches</p>

<p>Victory: The hilarious moment comes as Today show finally caught up to Seven's Sunrise in the ratings. Last week, the Channel Nine breakfast show, fronted by Karl and Allison, won on  audiences across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane</p>

<p>Last week, Nine's flagship breakfast show won on the east coast. </p>

<p>The once-struggling breakfast program beat Sunrise by 195,000 to 181,000 in total people, across Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.</p>

<p>Sunrise, hosted by Sam Armytage and David 'Kochie' Koch, is still the most-watched breakfast program across the five capital cities - including Adelaide and Perth - with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000.</p>

<p>But the west coast cities are considered less important to advertisers, meaning Today has more viewers where it matters, so to speak. </p>

<p>Across Australia: Sunrise, hosted by Samantha Armytage and David 'Kochie' Koch, is still however the nation's most-watched breakfast TV program across the five capital cities, with a viewership of 259,000 compared to Today's 229,000</p>
