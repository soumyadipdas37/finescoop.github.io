<p>Game: Keanu Reeves, 56, has been fully transformed into CGI for his role in the new video game Cyberpunk 2077</p>

<p>The game, due out on November 19, sees the player roam a dystopian universe where the world is obsessed with body modifications.</p>

<p>Players can take on Night City looking for their next big score while Keanu’s Johnny Silverhand will be key in taking their journey to the next level.</p>

<p>Keanu features prominently in the trailer where he walks through a dark city scape in between clips of the life-like characters featured in the game. </p>

<p>In the clip, he says: 'In 2077 what makes someone a criminal? Getting caught. In Night City you can be come anyone, anything, if your body can pay the price. So seize the day and set it up with fire.' </p>

<p>Likeness: The actor has provided full body motion capture, voice over, and full likeness to the game which has been eight years in the making</p>

<p>In the game, Johnny Silverhand was the leader and frontman of SAMURAI, a chrome-rock music band and fights the inhumane practices used to take more and more of people’s personal liberties. </p>

<p>It comes after Keanu had nothing but praise for coronavirus safety measures on the set of The Matrix 4, which he has been filming recently in Berlin, Germany. </p>

<p>The actor said there were 'thoughtful, effective protocols in place' on set in a video chat interview with the Associated Press.</p>

<p>He said: 'There’s some really thoughtful, effective protocols in place, and the rhythm of filmmaking has not been really impacted or interrupted, in the sense of filming.</p>

<p>'That’s because of the hard work and organization, and again the thoughtfulness that has gone into the protocols.'</p>

<p>Filming originally began in San Francisco, where some locals were angered by property destruction caused in the midst of action scenes.</p>

<p>The production then moved to Berlin in February but was quickly shut down due to the pandemic.</p>

<p>Back in June, Keanu told Empire Magazine that it was the quality of the writing that drew him to this installment of The Matrix, which hasn't gotten a finalised title yet. '</p>

<p>'Lana Wachowski wrote a beautiful script and a wonderful story that resonated with me,' he said. 'That’s the only reason to do it.'</p>

<p>The new working relationship seemed to still have some of the old magic, even though Lana's sister Lilly Wachowski sat out this installment.</p>

<p>To work with her again is just amazing. It’s been really special, and the story has, I think, some meaningful things to say, and that we can take some nourishment from.'</p>

<p>The Matrix was originally envisioned as a science fiction–action film starring Will Smith in the Neo role, though he turned it down, and Val Kilmer as Morpheus, who was eventually played by Laurence Fishburne.</p>

<p>The ground-breaking film went on to be one of the most successful films of 1999 and earned four Academy Awards, along with copious praise from critics.</p>

<p>Two sequels, Reloaded and Revolutions, were filmed back-to-back and released close together in 2003.</p>
