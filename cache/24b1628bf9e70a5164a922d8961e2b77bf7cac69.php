<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Zoe Ball was pictured stepping out solo on Tuesday, as she was seen for the first time since her boyfriend Michael Reed faced shocking claims allegations from an ex.</p>

<p>Last week, Michael, 50, was slammed by his ex Lorraine Ashdown, the mother of his four-year-old daughter, who accused him of claiming benefits after being ordered to pay £20,000 in child support arrears.</p>

<p>But DJ Zoe, 49, appeared keen to put the drama behind her on Tuesday, when she was pictured strolling solo through the bustling streets of London.</p>

<p>Stepping out: Zoe Ball was pictured stepping out solo on Tuesday, as she was seen for the first time since her boyfriend Michael Reed faced shocking claims allegations from an ex</p>

<p>The star looked casually cool, wearing a black quilted jacket with cropped faded jeans and a pair of white plimsolls.</p>

<p>With her flaxen locks falling to her shoulders, the star cracked a smile before putting on her face mask as she prepared to press on with her day.</p>

<p>Her outing comes days after Michael's ex Lorraine told The Sun: 'He's such a ducker and a diver and a chancer, and I think he has done this on purpose to avoid paying.</p>

<p>Claims: The DJ's beau Michael Reed has been slammed by his ex Lorraine Ashdown, who is the mother of his four-year-old daughter. Pictured in December 2018</p>

<p>'I don't know if Zoe is aware of this, but she should tell him to sort it out. It is a disgrace that he is living the high life with her while avoiding his responsibilities.'</p>

<p>Michael and Zoe split in 2019 but got back together this year. It's thought they now live together. </p>

<p>Michael is a former construction firm boss and, last month, was ordered to pay the child maintenance costs of  £19,290.94 to Lorraine, after allegedly under-estimating his earnings.</p>

<p>Lorraine cannot chase him for the money now that he is on benefits, according to the Child Maintenance Service.</p>

<p>Moving on: With her flaxen locks falling to her shoulders, the star cracked a smile before putting on her face mask as she prepared to press on with her day</p>

<p>Fuming: Lorraine Ashdown, 46, has accused Michael, 50, of claiming benefits after being ordered to pay £20k in child support arrears, suggesting he is trying to dodge the payments</p>

<p>Lorraine and Michael, both from Kent, split up not long after they had their child. Michael then moved to a four-bedroom home in Chislehurst, which he rented.</p>

<p>He is believed to have moved in with Radio 2 host Zoe, who lives in a £1.5million property in Sussex.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Michael for comment, but he told The Sun on Saturday that the claims are 'incorrect'. </p>

<p>Lorraine provided paperwork when speaking to the publication, seemingly backing up her claims.</p>

<p>Zoe will soon return to screens on Strictly: It Takes Two, alongside Rylan Clark-Neal. </p>
