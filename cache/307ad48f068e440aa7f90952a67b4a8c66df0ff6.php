<p>Larsa and Scottie were married from 1997 until their tumultuous divorce in 2018.</p>

<p>The former couple, who appear to be amicable terms, share four children, sons Scotty, 19, Preston, 18, and Justin, 15, and daughter Sophia, 12.</p>

<p>'I was married to him for 20 years, I did everything for him and my family. People change and that's what really happened,' explained Larsa to TMZ, after allegations of cheating began to surface online.</p>

<p>Larsa had a rumored fall out with the Kardashian family earlier this year. Kourtney and Khloe unfollowed Larsa on Instagram amid the ongoing fallout from Kanye West's Twitter meltdown.</p>

<p>The dramatic unfollowing was seemingly prompted after the rapper, 43, cryptically Tweeted: 'Larsa' along with a thinking face emoji, followed by the question: 'Should I name more?'</p>

<p>A search of the reality TV sisters' Instagram accounts shows neither of them – or sister Kim – follow the wife of NBA legend Scottie Pippen.</p>

<p>Larsa appeared to respond by unfollowing the famous sisters, including her BFF Kim, and the following morning appeared to address the rumours as she shared a post in which she revealed she was 'praying that everybody finds peace'. </p>
