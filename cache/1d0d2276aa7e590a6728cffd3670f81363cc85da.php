<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's no secret brands depend on prime time television shows to promote their products during ad breaks.</p>

<p>But viewers were quick notice the not-so-subtle use of product placement within Wednesday night's installment of The Bachelor.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the episode, a handful of the remaining ladies vying to win Locky Gilbert's heart were spotted by a table with a plate full of Magnum ice-creams.  </p>

<p>'Obvious much?' On Wednesday night, viewers slammed The Bachelor for cringeworthy product placement after cameras zoomed in on the ladies eating ice-cream </p>

<p>At one point one of Locky's suitors is heard saying, 'Alright. I'm having an ice cream,' before walking over to the bowl to help herself.</p>

<p>It was enough to drive the Twitterverse nuts, with fans slamming the show for the shameless in-your-face ad.   </p>

<p>'Gotta make sure the camera takes a LONG, LINGERING shot... of that obvious Magnum ice cream product placement,' one fan tweeted. </p>

<p>'Also, it's a very sizable cheese platter. And is that a magnum of champers?' a second wrote. </p>

<p>Fancy an ice-cream? It was enough to drive the Twitterverse nuts, with fans slamming the show for the shameless in-your-face ad</p>

<p>Meanwhile a third said: 'Must eat Magnum, must eat Magnum,' before sarcastically writing, '[I have] No idea why,' alongside a photo of Bart Simpson hypnotised.</p>

<p>And it seems the advertisement may have worked, with another fan commenting: 'Why do I feel like an ice cream all of a sudden?'</p>

<p>In the following commercial break, a voice over was heard thanking the show's sponsor, wait for it, Magnum. </p>

<p>Fancy that! 'Gotta make sure the camera takes a LONG, LINGERING shot... of that obvious Magnum ice cream product placement,' one fan tweeted.</p>

<p>It's not the first time the show has come under fire for product placement.</p>

<p>Earlier in the season The Bachelor featured shameless plugs for ready-made meal company, YouFoodz, and Bonds undies.   </p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten</p>

<p>Revealing: Guess we now know what jocks Locky wears! </p>

<p>Hungry: One of the girls was seen putting a YouFoodz container in the microwave </p>
