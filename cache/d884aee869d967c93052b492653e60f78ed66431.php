<p>A New South Wales Police media spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia the driver was taken to Fairfield Hospital, where she was assessed for shock. </p>

<p>A photo taken at the scene and shared by Mr Bowen on his Twitter page showed a window bearing his face had been crushed and detached from the wall.</p>

<p>Mr Bowen wrote alongside the photo the crash had been caused by a 'local resident' who 'had some difficulty parking'. </p>

<p>Police, paramedics and firefighters were all called to the scene after the vehicle mounted the curb and smashed through one of the office's windows</p>

<p>'She has been taken away by ambulance but is doing OK,' he said.</p>

<p>'Luckily, there was no-one in our office waiting room at the time.</p>

<p>'All my staff are OK. It will be a while before we are able to get back in the office, so please understand why we aren't answering the office phones or emails just at the moment.' </p>
