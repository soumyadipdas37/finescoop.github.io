<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Andy Murray has shown off his lighter side by testing out the new 'relaxing zone' at the US Open... and getting completely furious in the process.</p>

<p>Murray took the Amazon Prime cameras into the new area for players at Flushing Meadows, where a series of activities are set up in order to take their minds off the pressures of the tennis tournament.</p>

<p>Crazy golf and cornhole are among the small games players can put their mind to, though the competitor in Murray soon surged to the surface and prompted several swear word-laden rants.</p>

<p>In the short segment hilariously titled 'Andycam: players relaxing', Murray can be seen cutting short crazy golf putts while yelling to himself: 'Ah just f******* hit it man.' </p>

<p>Andy Murray has been sizing up the crazy golf course at the US Open's players 'relaxing zone'</p>

<p>Ever the competitor, Murray's fury boiled over after he missed a simple close-range putt</p>

<p>Moving onto cornhole, Murray completely misses the target before reflexively yelling: 'Oh that's terrible f****** hell!'. </p>

<p>The Scotsman could be seen shaking his head angrily before smiling to himself when turning back to the rolling cameras.</p>

<p>Murray then hilariously concluded the clip by stating, completely unconvincingly: 'And yeah, it's just a little way the players can relax.'</p>

<p>The complex also includes an outdoor gym area and a series of basketball hoops for players to enjoy during their time away from the courts. </p>

<p>The former world No.1 then left the crazy golf to take the cameras over to the cornhole section</p>

<p>But Murray was soon back on the X-rated rants after failing to hit the target for the crew</p>

<p>After swearing his way around Murray hilariously concluded by promoting the 'relaxing' zone</p>

<p>It has been far from a relaxing for Murray however, after the tennis legend was pushed to the limit in his opening US Open clash with Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka.</p>

<p>Murray looked destined for defeat after losing the first two sets to a seemingly more energetic opponent.</p>

<p>But the former world No.1 found something deep within and managed to surge back into the reckoning, winning the third set to take the match the full distance.</p>

<p>It was Murray's first Grand Slam singles match in 596 days, though the tennis icon finally managed to shake off the rust when it really mattered.</p>

<p>Murray returns to action in the second round on Friday, when he meets Canadian Felix Auger Aliassime. </p>

<p>Murray this week revealed the motivation behind his comeback to Grand Slam tennis came in the form of a surgeon, who told him he was finished at the elite level of sport.</p>

<p>Murray sealed a thrilling comeback in the US Open first round to beat Yoshihito Nishioka</p>

<p>The pair embraced at the net following the thrilling first-round contest at the US Open</p>

<p>‘There is one person in particular that helped me,’ Murray said. ‘It was the surgeon who told me after Wimbledon in 2017 that I didn’t have long left and I could have surgery - resurfacing or hip replacement - but I wouldn’t play professional sport again.</p>

<p>‘It was weird timing, I actually bumped into him the morning after I had the hip resurfacing (early last year) when I took my first steps with the crutches. I walked past him in the hallway and he smiled at me and said to my wife, “I told him he was going to have to do this”.</p>

<p>‘It just really got me. I was not happy. I would say that was the thing that gave me the biggest motivation because at that moment I had obviously been going through a difficult time, had the operation and I felt that there was a bit of smugness to what he told me,' Murray added.</p>
