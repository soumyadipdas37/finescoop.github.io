<p>Griezmann previously wore the No 17 shirt but has now been rewarded with a lower number</p>

<p>Durant, who wears the No 7 for the Brooklyn Nets, appeared in a video posted on Barcelona's Twitter account in which he is seen unveiling Griezmann's new shirt.</p>

<p>The video is accompanied by the following voiceover: 'New desires. New dreams. Same ambition. Welcome back number seven.'</p>

<p>A video showed Durant unveiling Griezmann as the new owner of Barcelona's No 7 shirt</p>

<p>Griezmann joined Barcelona from Atletico Madrid last year for £108million.   </p>

<p>Much was expected of the Frenchman in his first campaign at the club but he mustered only 15 goals in 48 appearances, with Barcelona ending the campaign without a trophy. </p>

<p>There had been suggestions that Griezmann could leave Barcelona after Lionel Messi ended up staying at the club, but his change in squad number is the surest sign yet that he is still very much a prominent figure at the club.</p>
