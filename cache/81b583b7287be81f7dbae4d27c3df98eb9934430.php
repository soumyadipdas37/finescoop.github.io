<p>It's a deal! The couple purchased the 1950s home in Sydney's Northern Beaches for $6.95million</p>

<p>The former Miss Universe had hoped to move closer to her family in northern NSW, but her plans were put on hold after she and Jake struggled to find a buyer.</p>

<p>The property's listing agent, Ken Jacobs told The Daily Telegraph in April the COVID-19 restrictions had made it difficult for the couple to sell.</p>

<p>It's in a holding pattern of sorts,' Mr Jacobs told the publication.</p>

<p>He added: 'It's an issue of getting access. We would normally do inspections by appointment only anyway, but there is now the question of verifying with buyers where they have travelled.'</p>
