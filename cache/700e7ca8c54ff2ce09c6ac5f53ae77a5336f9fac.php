<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 12-year-old boy has avoided jail time for causing a crash that killed an 11-year-old girl.</p>

<p>The boy, who cannot be named, was doing donuts in his dad's ute in Wyndham, in the Kimberley region of Western Australia, when the vehicle rolled, killing Abbey Forrest.</p>

<p>Abbey had been sitting in the tray of the ute with another girl when it flipped. </p>

<p>The boy was sentenced to an eight-month intensive youth supervision order at the Kununurra Children's Court on Monday after pleading guilty to dangerous driving causing death. </p>

<p>Children's Court Judge Hylton Quail was scathing of the child's parents for giving the boy access to the vehicle, ABC News reported. </p>

<p>Abbey Forrest, 11, (pictured) died after sliding out the tray of a ute near Wyndham in the Kimberley region of Western Australia on September 7, 2019</p>

<p>'The truth is this tragic accident should never have been allowed to happen,' Judge Quail said, accusing the father of a 'gross failure' of parenting. </p>

<p>The court heard the child's father had done donuts with him while they were in the car together.</p>

<p>Judge Hylton Quail said he also taught his son to drive and knowingly gave the boy the keys to the car.</p>

<p>The star student was named junior person of the year at the East Kimberley Aboriginal Achievement Awards only weeks before her death</p>

<p>The 12-year-old was originally charged with manslaughter but the charge was downgraded to dangerous driving causing death.</p>

<p>The judge also acknowledged the child's remorse and ongoing trauma as a result of his friend's death.</p>

<p>He said the boy was so upset he was unable to apologise personally to Abbey's mother after the crash because he was scared to talk to her.</p>

<p>Instead, he wrote a letter of apology to the family and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p>Abbey's family remains devastated over the death of the talented Aboriginal student.</p>

<p>Her brother Tom Forrest said it was difficult to comprehend the child responsible was only given eight months.</p>

<p>Her mother, Jessica Forrest (pictured together), laid her daughter to rest on October 7 last year - what would have been Abbey's 12th birthday</p>

<p>The schoolgirl's family say they are still coming to term with Abbey's death, but are finally starting to get closure  </p>

<p>But he agreed the situation was a result of 'irresponsible parenting' and said the family was finally getting closure over Abbey's death.   </p>

<p>'I think our family always knew the sentence would never make us feel good, or would never be enough to match what we've been through with Abbey's death,' Mr Forrest said.</p>

<p>'We feel like we've lost everything, and the other party hasn't lost anything.'</p>

<p>The star student was killed in the fatal accident on September 7 last year. </p>

<p>Just weeks before her death, Abbey was named junior person of the year at the East Kimberley Aboriginal Achievement Awards.</p>

<p>She had also been offered four scholarships and was only days away from starting her induction at a private school in Perth. </p>

<p>Abbey was buried on October 7 2019 surrounded by family, elders, classmates and community - some of whom read letters to her during the service</p>

<p>Flowers adorn the child's grave at Gully Cemetery, Wyndham, in Western's Australia's far north</p>
