<p>To make the sweets, Ms Head crushes the biscuits in a food processor or by hand with a rolling pin, then mixes the crumbs into the softened cream cheese.</p>

<p>Taking a tablespoon of the biscuit and cheese mixture, she presses a Rolo into the middle, flattening the creamy biscuit out then wrapping it over the sweet into a truffle-shaped ball.</p>

<p>The truffles should be placed on a baking tray and chilled in the freezer for about 20 minutes until hard.</p>

<p>While they set, Ms Head melts chocolate in the microwave and dips the hardened truffles in the liquid, making sure to coat every inch.</p>

<p>Finally, she sprinkles leftover Oreo crumbs over the top and refrigerates to set.</p>

<p>A video showing the truffles being prepared has been liked 12,500 times since it was shared, with many calling the recipe a 'game-changer'.</p>

<p>It's the latest of Ms Head's indulgent desserts to go viral online, following a recipe for s'mores pastry and a wildly popular method for making Mars and Malteser slices.</p>

<p>A Rolo should be pressed into the centre of a tablespoon of the biscuits and cream cheese mixture (left), then rolled into a ball and dipped in melted chocolate (right)</p>

<p>In August, she told followers how to make the 'chewy, crunchy, chocolaty' slices using seven ingredients: 100 grams of unsalted butter, 120ml of condensed milk, 245 grams of plain biscuits, 400 grams of chocolate, one teaspoon of vegetable oil and Mars and Maltesers to decorate. </p>

<p>'No baking involved, just a lot of melting!' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>To make the base, Ms Head melts the butter and condensed milk, then adds chopped Mars bar, crushed Maltesers and crushed biscuits.</p>

<p>After mixing well, she pats the mixture into the base of a baking dish and refrigerates for one to two hours until set. </p>

<p>Once hardened, she removes the dish from the fridge and melts chocolate mixed with vegetable oil to make it silky smooth, then pours the liquid over the base.</p>

<p>After giving the tray a shake to ensure the chocolate spreads to every corner, Ms Head decorates with chunks of Mars bar and half-cut Maltesers before refrigerating for another hour until set.</p>

<p>When her social media presence began to skyrocket at the start of the coronavirus crisis in March, Ms Head told Daily Mail Australia it made her 'very proud to help people keep occupied' during a time when strict social distancing laws forced billions to stay home around the world.</p>
