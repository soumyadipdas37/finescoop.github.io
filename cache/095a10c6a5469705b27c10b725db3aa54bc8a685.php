<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app will launch in England and Wales on September 24, the Department of Health has confirmed.</p>

<p>Officials have repeatedly delayed the rollout of the smartphone software since it was first expected in May but trials on the Isle of Wight failed.</p>

<p>The app will add to the NHS Test &amp; Trace service which aims to track down people who have been close to those infected with the coronavirus.</p>

<p>It will use Bluetooth to keep an anonymous log of everyone somebody has been close to, and alert them if one of them tests positive for Covid-19.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said today: 'We need to use every tool at our disposal to control the spread of the virus including cutting-edge technology.</p>

<p>'The launch of the app later this month across England and Wales is a defining moment and will aid our ability to contain the virus at a critical time.' </p>

<p>The announcement comes after Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, yesterday launched 'Protect Scotland' app north of the border. </p>

<p>Officials abandoned the NHS's attempt at making its own app in June when they realised it didn't work on iPhones (Pictured: The app in development stages)</p>
