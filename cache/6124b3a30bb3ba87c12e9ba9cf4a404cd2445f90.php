<p>Lights, camera, action! On Friday, the actress was spotted on set in Byron Bay as she filmed scenes with Luke Hemsworth [pictured] for their new road movie, Bosch and Rockit</p>

<p>Gang: TV presenter Richard Wilkins and his new girlfriend Nicola Dale were also seen on set</p>

<p>All is well: 35-year-old Isabel looked happy and relaxed in between takes for writer-director Tyler Atkins’ hotly anticipated debut feature</p>

<p>Low-key cool: Isabel was dressed casually for the day of filming, wearing a sheer black lace number atop a yellow cropped singlet</p>

<p>Luke - who at 39 is the older brother of fellow actors Chris, 37, and Liam, 30 - also appeared in his element as he resumed filming commitments in the famous coastal town.</p>

<p>The Westworld actor looked summer-ready in a printed navy button-up shirt, casual shorts and flip flops.</p>

<p>In the movie, which is inspired by real events, Luke is playing Bosch while rising actor Rasmus King, 15, is taking on the role of his son, Rockit.</p>

<p>The two actors were seen carrying surfboards and towels for their scene in the sun-kissed Byron weather.</p>

<p>Fun times: Despite the recent backlash Isabel has faced when it comes to her actions and views regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, she sported an easygoing and carefree demeanour</p>

<p>The film's shooting comes nearly two weeks after actress Isabel went to great lengths to stay anonymous during a Zoom call with COVID-19 conspiracy theorists and lockdown critics.</p>

<p>Covering her face with a black hoodie and mask and using the alias 'X', the anti-vaxxer told her co-panellists that she needed 'to be careful about being outspoken' because she was a famous Australian film and television actress.</p>

<p>'I'm here, and I don't want to be anonymous, but I am about to start filming a film, and I do need to be careful about being outspoken because you can get dropped from charities, you can lose campaigns with car companies,' Isabel said.</p>

<p>'It has happened to me in recent times for speaking out. I feel careful, and I don't want to elicit any aggressive, threatening responses.</p>

<p>Lucas said she felt '100 per cent called to shine a light on the reality of what's really going on' in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown directives.</p>

<p>Movie star: Luke - who at 39 is the older brother of fellow actors Chris, 37, and Liam, 30 - also appeared in his element as he resumed filming commitments in the famous coastal town</p>

<p>'There's a certain level of agenda and darkness that has had authority ... and that has had a lot of people believing lies,' she said in the Zoom chat with other well-known figures in the anti-lockdown and anti-mask community.</p>

<p>She also claimed thst she met several doctors while living in California who dropped out of the medical field due to 'corruption'.</p>

<p>'All of what they were speaking about is what we're facing right now. When we are in a fear state, we just follow what we're told.</p>

<p>Lucas said that at the beginning of the pandemic in March she was asked by her local council to film a video calling on locals to stay at home to stop the spread of the virus. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After signing on for the campaign, Lucas revealed that she regretted appearing in the clip during the Zoom chat.</p>

<p>'I saw that there was all these other great people doing it and it's that sort of thing where you can get looped in without realising you're being looped in,' she said.</p>

<p>'But those with a strong conscience and strong integrity won't as easily sell out.'</p>
