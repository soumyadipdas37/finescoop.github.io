<p>Darren Wakley was on a tour with Jurassic Jetski Tours for his 40th birthday when he saw the dolphin, nicknamed Danny, jump 5ft through the air right next to his water craft in Weymouth, Dorset.</p>

<p>His instructor Steve Hamilton had been taking the group of four on a jet ski tour to Portland Bill when he spotted the dolphin's fin near the harbour entrance and told the group to stop.</p>

<p>With his camera at the ready, Mr Hamilton was able to capture the friendly dolphin leap into the air and greet Mr Wakley.  </p>

<p>Mr Wakley, who had been on a tour with Jurassic Jetski Tours for his 40th birthday, watches in awe as the dolphin emerges from the water</p>

<p>During the clip, Mr Wakley stops his jet-ski in the sea and watches in awe as the dolphin suddenly leaps out from beneath the water.</p>

<p>The sea creature splashes back into the water before jumping out from the water once more to greet the group. </p>

<p>Mr Wakley said: 'It scared the life out of me.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr Hamilton added: 'There's three dolphins in the area, Danny is the larger one and we think the other two are females and he's trying to impress them.</p>

<p>'We saw him every day last season but we think he's had a couple of nicks with propellers over winter as he had been a bit more stand-offish at the start of this season.</p>

<p>'I spotted a fin roughly where we were heading so I told everyone to stop and he came over to us.</p>

<p>'He rolled about a bit next to us first, they like the jet of the water on their bellies, and then he jumped out of the water.</p>

<p>'The other two were there too, next to me watching Danny show off.</p>

<p>'It's quite a special thing to see. I love seeing the joy in customers' eyes. Often I don't tell them I've spotted it and it scares the life out of everyone when the dolphin jumps.</p>

<p>The dolphin leaps  5ft through the air right next to Mr Wakley's water craft as the jet-skier watches in shock</p>

<p>The surprised jet-ski rider looks around as the dolphin splashes back into the water</p>

<p>'They were amazed, I don't think they have ever seen anything like that before. Because they are wild and choosing to spend their time with us it feels more special.</p>

<p>'I knew without a doubt I had caught something good on camera. It is rare for them to completely breach like that, especially that close to you.</p>

<p>'It was pretty amazing.'</p>

<p>Mr Wakley later told BBC Radio Solent: 'We were just sat there chatting away and out of nowhere he's leapt out of the water within two to three foot of you. It does make you jump.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I think just prior to the dolphin leaping out of the water, they popped up. </p>

<p>'So we stopped the craft and I think Steve just got his camera ready and as he was trying to take a photo of what he thought was going to be the right time. It was the perfect timing.'  </p>
