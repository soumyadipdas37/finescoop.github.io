<p>The We Can't Stop artist recounted: 'I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s***. I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light. </p>

<p>'The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f***ing lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn't turn the beauty light off.'</p>

<p>Miley continued: 'They said, "Okay, we'll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys," because that's what I want. And then something that I was doing... for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s*** and they said, "You want to be treated like a guy? We wouldn't be dealing with this if a guy was doing it."</p>

<p>'And I said, "Well a guy wouldn't be doing this because a guy doesn't sell your show with sex the way that I'm going to." And I'm aware of that. It's a ridiculous conversation and also embarrassing.'</p>
