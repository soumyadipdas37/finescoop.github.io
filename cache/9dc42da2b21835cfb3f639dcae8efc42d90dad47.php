<p>Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu was telling MPs about the terror threat the country faces – particularly describing a 'dramatic' rise in the number of right-wing cases.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Commons Home Affairs Committee on Wednesday, he said: 'What I am seeing, particularly in the right-wing terrorism space – and this is anecdotal so it is not academic – but is an increase in lots of young people being attracted to this.</p>

<p>'We are seeing people as young as 13 starting to talk about committing terrorist attacks.'</p>

<p>They have a mixed ideology and for 38 per cent of referrals to the Prevent anti-radicalisation programme an ideology cannot be determined, he said, adding: 'They are just interested in violence.'</p>

<p>He said social media has been a strong influence, particularly during the coronavirus lockdown when there was 'no other form of distraction or protective factor', like school, work or other friends and relatives being present.</p>

<p>Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu was telling MPs about the terror threat the country faces – particularly describing a 'dramatic' rise in the number of right-wing cases</p>

<p>He added: 'That's definitely an effect of Covid-19 we are worried about.'</p>

<p>Most terrorists are 30 or younger and male, he said, but added: 'What has been disturbing is the number that are becoming much younger.</p>

<p>'It's still small, if I showed you the figures you would go 'well that's not much'. But the worrying thing is the trajectory is downwards in age terms.'</p>

<p>Mr Basu described the rise in right-wing terrorism and extremism as 'pretty dramatic', telling the committee the casework for this had risen from 6 per cent in 2016 to 10 per cent, while the majority continues to be Islamist.</p>

<p>Last year he characterised it as the fastest growing terror threat.</p>

<p>Police and security services have started to look more at the right-wing threat, he said, adding: 'A near doubling of that threat since 2016 does worry me.'</p>

<p>In June, 19 per cent of the 243 terrorist prisoners in Great Britain were categorised as holding far right-wing ideologies, a rise of four percentage points in a year, according to the latest Home Office figures.</p>

<p>The proportion of prisoners holding right-wing ideologies has risen 'steadily' over the last three years, up from 33 to a record of 45 in the latest year, after just six were recorded in 2013.</p>

<p>Some 76 per cent (184) held Islamist extremist views.</p>

<p>Mr Basu said counter-terror police and MI5 had more than 800 terror investigations under way, and a predicted 30 per cent rise in the threat since 2017 is 'still there' and 'sustained at that very high level'.</p>

<p>Police and security services have started to look more at the right-wing threat, he said, adding: 'A near doubling of that threat since 2016 does worry me'</p>

<p>Describing the threat as 'diverse, complex and unpredictable', he said encryption on messaging services had made it 'very difficult to see terrorists communicating'.</p>

<p>There have also been changes in the types of terrorists police are dealing with, their 'methodology and vector of attack', he added.</p>

<p>He said 16 attacks have been carried out since 2010, with 15 by 'lone actors', but he added this was a 'poor definition' as they rarely operate completely alone, often discussing plans with someone else, although they are not directed, supported or financed by a terrorist group.</p>

<p>While the ability of terrorist groups to 'direct and inspire overseas' has been limited, he warned the power of media and propaganda has not diminished.</p>

<p>He also wants more work to be done to address security measures at the 600,000 publicly accessible spaces around the country, amid fears they could be a target as 'terrorists will go for the crowd'.</p>

<p>Training and low-cost security measures should be considered as 'there is no way that we are going to be able to police that', he said.</p>

<p>He added: 'We only get up every day to stop terrorist attacks. We want to stop these attacks.</p>

<p>'I'm very aware that since March 2017 there have been 12 attacks</p>

<p>'It's very difficult to accept that fact when those attacks always feel to me like a personal failure. I still think about those attacks every single day.'</p>

<p>He expressed his concerns about the rise in extremism generally, telling the committee: 'My biggest concern at the moment is where extremism affects malleable, vulnerable people, of all kinds, age groups and societal backgrounds.</p>

<p>'The amplification of extremism and its ability to incite a vulnerable section of the population towards terrorism is probably my greatest single fear.'</p>

<p>He said Covid-19 had 'amplified the problem'.</p>
