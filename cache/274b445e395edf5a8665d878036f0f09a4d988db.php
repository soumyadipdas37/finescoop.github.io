<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Native tribes in Montana are celebrating the birth of an ultra-rare white buffalo calf.</p>

<p>The animal, a female born in June at Bitterroot Valley Bison Ranch in Missoula, has been named The Creator's White Buffalo Maiden.</p>

<p>Only about one in a million buffalo calves are born white, according to researchers, and many lose their snowy coloring as they grow. </p>

<p>Tribal members believe White Buffalo Maiden has immense cultural significance, with some saying she represents the strife plaguing our nation.</p>

<p>Others claim her arrival means women should take more leadership roles in tribal affairs. </p>

<p>A rare white buffalo, named The Creator's White Buffalo Maiden, was born in June at Bitterroot Valley Bison Ranch in Missoula, Montana. Only about one in a million buffalo calves are white, according to experts</p>

<p>Some 30 people from Montana's seven main tribes gathered in Lolo on August 29 for a ceremony honoring White Buffalo Maiden's arrival. </p>

<p>'I think the reason the Creator sent this calf here is because of all the injustice that's been done,' Glenn Gopher, who conducted the ceremony, told the Great Falls Tribune.</p>

<p>'Our country is in serious chaos. We have this virus and we have racial injustice. Our world is corrupt.'</p>

<p>But the buffalo, which has returned from the brink of extinction, is also a symbol of hope.</p>

<p>About 30 people, including members of all seven Montana tribes, held a ceremony to celebrate White Buffalo Maiden's arrival as a symbol of hope, harmony and female empowerment</p>

<p>The Creator's White Buffalo Maiden off in the distance. White buffalo may result from albinism or a genetic condition that causes a calf to be born white but turn brown within a year or two</p>

<p>'She shows that we need to love and respect one another. Refrain from hatred and racism,' Gopher said. 'Love and respect are what's missing in this country; our lawmakers are out of hand.'</p>

<p>He said the group prayed 'for peace and harmony for all of mankind.'</p>

<p>The 300-acre Bitterroot Valley ranch is home to 90 cows and eight bulls, so Gopher wasn't sure he'd get to see The Creator's White Buffalo Maiden. </p>

<p>She ran up to the fence just as he was heading to his car, followed by two bulls.</p>

<p>'It was the most beautiful appearance,' Gopher told the Tribune. 'I'm sure I will never see anything like that in my lifetime again.'</p>

<p>On Facebook, Jimmy St Goddard, a member of the Blackfeet Nation, said his people had been waiting for this sacred arrival for 900 years.</p>

<p>'For 40,000 years the Creator has used the buffalo to provide the indigenous [with] sacred messages and prophecies.'</p>

<p>Blair Gopher, a member of the Blackfeet and Ojibwe tribes, said a female calf was a sign more women should hold positions of authority.</p>

<p>'Our women have been abused, and we need to pray for better leadership in this country,' she said. 'Women will lead, and we must respect them.'</p>

<p>The National Buffalo Association puts the birth of a white buffalo calf at one in every 10 million births, while the Montana Historical Society says its closer to one in every five million.</p>

<p>With the advent of selective buffalo breeding on private ranches, though, it's now closer to one in a million.</p>

<p>'The whiteness is a recessive gene,' wildlife biologist Craig Knowles told the paper. 'But it's important to know that some of them don't retain their whiteness as adults.'</p>

<p>Buffalo coats are almost always brown, and their skin is usually dark brown or black.  </p>

<p>A blue-eyed white buffalo named Big Medicine (seen here) was born on Montana's Flathead Indian Reservation in 1933</p>

<p>After his death in 1959, Big Medicine was stuffed and mounted and remains on display at the Montana Historical Society</p>

<p>White buffalo may result from albinism, an absence of pigment that remains throughout their life, or it may be due to a genetic condition that causes a calf to be born white but turn brown within a year or two.</p>

<p>They may also be leucistic, with white fur but blue eyes.</p>

<p>White buffalo can be lucrative for ranchers, Knowles added, as some will pay handsomely to breed a white bull and white cow.</p>

<p>His arrival was also celebrated by local tribes, who saw it as a symbol of their efforts to recover the decimated buffalo population.</p>
