<p>Ted Wayman, a newsman for WCVB-TV, suffered what police called a 'severe laceration' in the attack at around 9.05pm on Sunday when he was stabbed in the arm with scissors</p>

<p>Wayman was working on a story in Copley Square (above) when he was attacked by a man who police say was 'antagonizing the victim as well as other individuals' throughout the day</p>

<p>According to a statement from the Boston Police Department, which did not name Wayman as the victim, police were alerted of the attack shortly after 9pm.</p>

<p>'The victim stated he had several interactions with the suspect who had been antagonizing the victim as well as other individuals in the area throughout the day,' police said in the statement.</p>

<p>Cops say that when Wayman asked to be left alone, Aldana-Peraedes responded by whipping out a pair of scissors and wielding them above his head in a closed grip. </p>

<p>As the suspect began to stab the window of Wayman's news van, the reporter attempted to escape inside by closing the door, but was struck by the scissors in the arm, according to police.</p>

<p>Wayman managed to make it to safety inside the station's van, where his photojournalist partner helped tend to his injury, according to the Boston Globe, which first reported the attack. </p>

<p>The reporter was rushed to a nearby hospital in an ambulance and is expected to recover. </p>

<p>Police canvassed the area, detaining Aldana-Peraedes based on a description of the attacker.</p>

<p>After a positive identification, Aldana-Peraedes was arrested and charged with assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>

<p>Aldana-Peraedes was previously charged with assault and battery on a police officer causing injury in Roxbury in March of 2018, according to court records. </p>

<p>He has listed both St. Francis House and the Pine Street Inn as residences in the past. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney to speak on his behalf.</p>
