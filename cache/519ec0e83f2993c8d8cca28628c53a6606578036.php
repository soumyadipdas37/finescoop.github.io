<p>'By some miracle, I was allowed into ICU and was holding his hand, playing the Beatles and telling him how loved he was right till the very end.'</p>

<p>The singer had been as a live-in carer for her father in Ocean Grove, 22km southeast of Geelong, after two-stroke like episodes in 205 left him unable to look after himself. </p>

<p>In the post, the performer paid tribute to the 'incredible' man and urged others to hold their loved ones close. </p>

<p>'My father was the most incredible man I have ever known, and it has been my greatest joy &amp; privilege to have cared for him the last 5 years,' she continued.</p>

<p>'My family and I always been so aware of how many loved sharing our journey together and having a front row seat to his humour and wit. I took great joy in being able to share his wonderfulness with you all.'</p>

<p>'Please hug those closest to you tonight &amp; tell them you love them.'</p>

<p>The 63-year-old's health had been deteriorating since 2000, after he had two brain tumours removed. </p>

<p>After the incidents in 2015, Mr Cooper lost use of his body, all his strength, his memory, sense of surroundings, as well as battling Parkinson’s disease, diabetes and dementia.  </p>

<p>The vocalist, who came seventh on the hit series in 2009, had been caring for her father for the past five years after two-medical incidents left him unable to look after himself</p>

<p>Reflecting on her role as a carer, Ms Cooper told the Geelong Advertiser  last year that the duty changed her perspective on life.  </p>

<p>'I knew literally nothing. I came down while Dad was in hospital for a month and just watched and listened to the nurses,' she said.</p>

<p>'That responsibility was an adjustment, going from a very carefree adult to that type of a role reversal – this is a man who changed my nappies.' </p>

<p>'Caring for Dad has helped develop me into a better, more well-rounded person.'</p>

<p>Ms Cooper placed seventh in the reality TV show's seventh season in 2009, signing a contract with a Townsville record label shortly after. </p>

<p>She walked away from the deal six months later to become a Christian and attend bible college, putting a halt on singing for five years until the church asked her to lead the music team.  </p>

<p>Aside from being a carer, the vocalist has picked up gigs since moving back to Victoria and works as a social media influencer, boasting more than 10,000 fans on Instagram. </p>

<p>The seventh season of Australian Idol, the last to air, was won by Australian-born New Zealander Stan Walker who remains an active musician. </p>

<p>The singer signed a contract shortly after leaving the show but left it to attend bible college. Since 2015, she has spent her time focusing on her role as a carer and working as a social media influencer</p>
