<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Victor Osimhen believes that Napoli is the best club for him right now even though he rejected several Premier League clubs this summer ahead of the Serie A move.</p>

<p>The Nigerian forward had a stellar debut season at Lille last term, scoring 18 goals in 38 matches to make him one of the most highly-rated strikers in the 2019-20 campaign.</p>

<p>That rich goalscoring form allowed for the 21-year-old to be linked to the likes of Arsenal and Tottenham in England's top-flight but he instead moved to Gennaro Gattuso's side for deal which could rise to £72million. </p>

<p>The 21-year-old striker moved to Napoli for £72million this summer after a stellar year at Lille</p>

<p>But Osimhen told CAFOnline: 'Many predicted I will move to the EPL, and I had a lot of interesting offers from some clubs. But Napoli was the best choice for me.</p>

<p>'It was so because of the kind of player I want to be in the future, and the kind of great career I want to have. I have no doubt that Napoli is the club I need to achieve that greater height.</p>

<p>'The relationship between me and the coach and President (Aurelio De Laurentiis) is a very interesting one, because even before I came to Napoli, I spoke with both. They convinced me even more to sign for Napoli. </p>

<p>'The relationship is going very well, and I just want to repay them on the pitch for the trust they have in me.'</p>

<p>Osimhen admitted that Napoli is the perfect move as the Serie A season starts on Sunday</p>

<p>Before Osimhen's exciting spell at Lille, he struggled to perform at German side VfL Wolfsburg and was loaned out to Belgian club Charleroi in 2018</p>

<p>It was in this temporary spell where the Nigerian found some form scoring 20 goals in 36 matches in all competitions which caught the eye of Lille. </p>

<p>Now he will get the chance to take on the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Romelu Lukaku for the Serie A Golden Boot award, which is a challenge the young striker is relishing.  </p>

<p>He added: 'I'm really looking forward to a new career here in Serie A. Playing against the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo is something one can eagerly await. So, I'm looking forward to facing him soon.' </p>

<p>'There is no pressure on me since I came here rather, I just need to work and do what I loved doing. I just need to do my work on the pitch and give my all like I have always been doing and getting the goals for both my club and country.</p>

<p>'This is the most important thing for me and there is no pressure at all. I just want to do my thing in my own way.'</p>

<p>Osimhen is Napoli's record signing and is one of the most exciting purchases the club has made in several years.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old is hoping he can have a similar effect to Diego Maradona in his Napoli spell between 1984 and 1991.</p>

<p>Though the forward's role model growing up was ex-Chelsea striker Didier Drogba and the new Napoli man even claims to have based his game around the former Ivory Coast goal machine.</p>

<p>Osimhen is Napoli's record signing and will follow in the footsteps of Diego Maradona (above)</p>

<p>The striker's idol is ex-Chelsea man Didier Drogba (above) and has based his game around him</p>

<p>Osimhen said: 'Choosing Drogba as a role model has really been helpful since my growing up years. I have not met him yet and I'm really looking forward to seeing him and getting one of his signed jerseys; that would really be a dream come true for me.</p>

<p>'Now, playing in a club that used to have Diego Maradona, who is undoubtedly one of the greatest players ever, is inspiring. </p>

<p>'Maradona is an idol here in Napoli and I have seen his pictures everywhere. He is truly the best. </p>

<p>'To be here and to play on the same pitch of Maradona is another dream came true.'</p>

<p>Osimhen will be looking to get his Serie A career off to the perfect start when Napoli visit Parma on Sunday for the opening match of the Italian top-flight. </p>
