<p>The mother-of-four appeared distracted as she gazed down at her phone while heading back to her car.   </p>

<p>Her outing comes after she reportedly declared she 'won't be bullied' by Rebekah Vardy, 38, when their libel case goes to court.  </p>

<p>Rebekah is said to have signed legal papers in a bid to get Coleen to head to court 'immediately' amid their ongoing WAG war.  </p>

<p>Laid-back look: She paired her casual outfit with grey trainers and wore her hair in a high bun</p>

<p>Energy: The star popped to a coffee shop to fuel up on caffeine </p>

<p>But a source told The Sun last weekend 'Coleen is totally confident. She says she won't be bullied and is ready for a scrap.'</p>

<p>Coleen has also said she won't be intimidated by 'strong-arm tactics' saying Rebekah's attempt to hurry along legal proceedings are 'laughable'. </p>

<p>It was reported that Rebekah has filed the papers under the impression that Coleen is 'dragging her heels' following her bombshell accusations she has been selling stories about her to The Sun. </p>

<p>According to reports, the session, which will be held later this year, will determine whether the wife of footballer Jamie Vardy was 'libelled' when Coleen accused her Instagram account of leaking stories to the press. </p>

<p>'This will mean that a judge can actually get to the crux of the case — and make those involved put up or shut up. It should mean things can finally get moving and dealt with quickly.</p>

<p>'This is a shot across the bows. It effectively says, "Come on, stop mucking about, let’s get on with this".'</p>

<p>MailOnline reached out to Rebekah and Coleen's representatives for comment at the time of publication. </p>

<p>The two are currently engaged in an ongoing feud which began when Coleen accused Rebekah of leaking stories to the press last year, a claim Rebekah vehemently denies. </p>
