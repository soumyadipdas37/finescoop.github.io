<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>President Donald Trump revealed he spent hours glued to the TV set Wednesday night amid bombshell revelations from Bob Woodward's book – as he tuned into Fox News and the Fox Business Network.</p>

<p>Trump ran through the lineup he watched during a press conference where he took just three questions – about why he 'lied' to the American people about the coronavirus instead of leveling with them, and about a probe of FBI conduct in the Russia probe.</p>

<p>After playing defense for more than 24 hours following revelations he spoke to Woodward about the deadly nature of the virus back in February and revealed he knew it traveled through the air, Trump tore into a cast of familiar characters from the Russia response.  </p>

<p>President Donald Trump revealed he watched five programs on Fox News and Fox Business Wednesday night, as the story of his comments about the coronavirus to Bob Woodward exploded</p>

<p>'These people got caught in prob the biggest political scandal in the history of our country. They got caught,' Trump fumed. </p>

<p>He declined to say what to expect from U.S. attorney John Durham's probe, then went straight into his TV lineup. </p>

<p>'If they say half as much as I already know just some seeing it. You have people – I watch some of the shows. I watched Liz McDonald. She’s fantastic. I watched Fox Business,' Trump began.</p>

<p>'I watched Lou Dobbs last night. Sean Hannity last night. Tucker last night. Laura,' he continued, referencing Laura Ingraham.</p>

<p>'I watched Fox &amp; Friends in the morning. You watch these shows. You don’t have to do too far into the details. They cover things – it’s really an amazing thing. They got caught in the biggest political scandal in the history of our country,' Trump said.</p>

<p>Dobbs was particularly adulatory Wednesday night. </p>

<p>'President Trump today had a great day, a day that any president could only dream of,' Dobbs said, even with the Woodward story swirling. He showed a graphic about Trump being a peace prize nominee after a far-right Norwegian politician nominated Trump for the Nobel.</p>

<p>Trump is on record several times saying he doesn't watch much TV.</p>

<p>In November in 2017 he told reporters: 'Believe it or not, even when I’m in Washington or New York, I do not watch much television.'</p>

<p>'People that don’t know me, they like to say I watch television — people with fake sources. You know, fake reporters, fake sources.'</p>

<p>Trump's disclosure about how much TV he watched follows report he phoned Rupert Murdoch to yell at him about the 'unfair' coverage he was receiving from Fox News.  </p>

<p>Vanity Fair reported Thursday that Murdoch does not think Trump - who he helped elect in 2016 with by far the most favorable mainstream news coverage of his campaign - will win a second term.  </p>

<p>Murdoch is trying to steer his empire towards a 'post-Trump environment,'  sources told the publication.</p>
