<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester United's showdown with Tottenham on the first weekend of October could be among the first set of Premier League games to have fans back in attendance.</p>

<p>The top flight has been played out in front of empty stadiums since its return in June after a three-month suspension because of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Fans were unable to attend games over the summer due to the Government's ban on mass gatherings but an easing of restrictions has given hope supporters could be back in stadiums from October 1.</p>

<p>Manchester United vs Tottenham could be one of the first matches to have fans in attendance</p>

<p>United host Spurs on the weekend of October 3, two days after fans are expected to return</p>

<p>All weekend of October 3:</p>

<p>Arsenal v Sheffield United </p>

<p>Aston Villa v Liverpool </p>

<p>Chelsea v Crystal Palace </p>

<p>Everton v Brighton</p>

<p>Leeds United v Manchester City </p>

<p>Leicester City v West Ham United </p>

<p>Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur </p>

<p>Newcastle United v Burnley </p>

<p>Southampton v West Bromwich Albion </p>

<p>Wolverhampton v Fulham </p>

<p>The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport remains hopeful that date will be given the green light after it was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month.</p>

<p>Other games on that first Premier League weekend after the proposed October 1 date include Leeds v Manchester City, Aston Villa v Liverpool and Chelsea v Crystal Palace. </p>

<p>However, The Telegraph reported on Wednesday that even though fans will be allowed back into stadiums then, the Government has set a 30 per cent capacity limit.</p>

<p>The Premier League are set to challenge that though because they want the number of fans allowed in to be tailored to each club and stadium.</p>

<p>Clubs with older, smaller grounds may see fewer than 30 per cent, while bigger and more modern venues want to host larger numbers.</p>

<p>Capping all stadiums at 30 per cent regardless of size or capability to host more would harm some clubs who are in need of as much match day revenue as possible.</p>

<p>It is claimed the Premier League are trying to boost their chances of having more fans back by pushing for the introduction of 'clinical passports'. </p>

<p>However, the DCMS are against the plan because 'officials feel it will prove too complicated', even though the Premier League are confident the capability exists. </p>

<p>Fans will reportedly have to take responsibility and adhere to a particular set of rules on behaviour before they're allowed inside stadiums. </p>

<p>Premier League matches have been played behind closed doors since the lockdown in March</p>

<p>Leeds fans could get their first taste of the Premier League in over a decade against Man City</p>

<p>One, according to The Sun, is likely to be that no singing or chanting is allowed during the games for fear of spreading the virus to other fans. </p>

<p>One-way entry and exit plus staggered arrival times are also likely to become the norm for those fans lucky enough to get a ticket. </p>

<p>Fans will be spread out to adhere to social distancing guidelines and hand sanitiser stations will be set up.</p>

<p>And fans will be expected to take full responsibility for themselves by not attending games if they show Covid-19 symptoms or if they've been near anyone who has them. </p>

<p>The Government has so far shown no sign of budging on its 30 per cent limit, with fears they will not change their stance until a vaccine is found.  </p>

<p>Fans will not be allowed into Nations League matches next month, even though some countries have already welcomed fans back to stadiums. </p>

<p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson halted sports fans from attending test events earlier this month</p>

<p>The UEFA Super Cup in Hungarian capital Budapest on September 24 will reportedly be used as a test event for crowds by UEFA.  </p>

<p>Despite the Government's plans to continue to relax lockdown rules, Prime Minister Johnson has not hesitated to slam the brakes on if there is a spike in coronavirus cases in the UK.</p>

<p>Earlier this month he cancelled test events at the last minute with racegoers halted at the Glorious Goodwood festival and cricket fans barred from attending matches at the Oval and Edgbaston.</p>

<p>The World Snooker Championship also welcomed fans for its first day but was then held behind closed doors before a socially-distanced audience of 300 were allowed into the final at the Crucible. </p>
