<p>The 20-year-old England international has previously been benched for arriving late for training, as was the case last November when he was 'considerably late' for a team meeting. </p>

<p>Now Sancho, who has been linked with a £108m move to Manchester United all summer and regularly plays Call of Duty with numerous United players, has admitted he still needs to work on his time management. </p>

<p>Jadon Sancho admits he is sometimes late for Dortmund training due to a 'sleeping problem'</p>

<p>Sancho plays Call of Duty against Jesse Lingard, Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba online </p>

<p>'In Germany there's a few things that I still need to work on,' Sancho told SoccerBible. </p>

<p>'Sometimes I'm late to training and it's things like this that I need to work on, because I have a sleep problem. </p>

<p>'Little things like that, where I need to be a little more professional and put things right. But I'm working on it and the club's helping me and the team is helping me. Slowly but surely, as I get older, I feel like I'm learning new things. </p>

<p>'People do say that I'm very mature for my age. I guess leaving home and learning things for myself has helped with that.'</p>

<p>Manchester United midfielder Jesse Lingard admitted Sancho 'regularly' plays video games</p>

<p>Man Utd midfielder Jesse Lingard revealed last month that Sancho 'regularly' plays Call of Duty with Old Trafford stars including Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba. </p>

<p>Lingard - who has played alongside Sancho for England - said in an interview that various players are hooked on battle game Call of Duty: Warzone, which came out this year.</p>

<p>He told Sporf: 'There's quite a few of us to be fair. Marcus [Rashford], Brandon [Williams], [Paul] Pogba, [Jadon] Sancho.</p>

<p>Marcus Rashford is also part of the United squad who play Call of Duty alongside Sancho </p>

<p>French World Cup winner Paul Pogba is also a fan of the video game with his team-mates</p>

<p>'I play with Dan James every day, so there's quite a few of us that play it quite regularly.'</p>

<p>Despite his time management, Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc was full of praise for Sancho's attitude, despite the constant transfer talk throughout this summer window. </p>

<p>'Jadon gives 100 per cent - that's all very, very positive.' </p>
