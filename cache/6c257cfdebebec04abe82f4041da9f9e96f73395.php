<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thailand's king and queen have attended celebrations at a hospital as crop-top-wearing protesters mocked his clothing and called for his power to be reduced.</p>

<p>King Maha Vajiralongkorn and Queen Suthida were at the Siriraj hospital in Bangkok for Prince Mahidol Day - to commemorate his contribution to medical education.</p>

<p>The monarch, who spends much of his time in Europe, laid a wreath at the foot of his grandfather's statue, local media said.</p>

<p>It is not clear if his mistress Sineenatra Wongvajirabhakdi, who was reinstated as his royal consort after being released from jail earlier this month, was at the event.</p>

<p>She has been given back her royal and military titles after she was previously accused of seeking to undermine the monarch's official wife, the queen.</p>

<p>It comes as a thousand demonstrators rallied at parliament as it debated amending the constitution, one of the demands behind nearly two months daily protests.</p>

<p>Protesters wore crop tops and sprayed a democracy plaque outside the building as they mocked the king for his clothing.</p>

<p>The two-day session of parliament was convened on Wednesday and was expected to vote late tonight on whether to accept a motion for constitutional changes.</p>

<p>But a lawmaker aligned with the government proposed the vote be postponed to November and a new committee be set up to study details around the process first.</p>

<p>The proposal was met with resistance from opposition parties and also angered the protesters.</p>

<p>Anon Nampa, one of the protest leaders, said: 'Do you hear the people? Or is the building so thick?'</p>

<p>The protesters want to change a constitution they say was engineered to ensure ex-junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stayed on as prime minister after last year's election.</p>

<p>They want his departure and some protesters also say the constitution gives too much power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.</p>

<p>The biggest demonstration so far drew tens of thousands of people over the weekend.</p>
