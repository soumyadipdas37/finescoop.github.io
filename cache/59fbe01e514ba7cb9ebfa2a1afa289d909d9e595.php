<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Trent Alexander-Arnold has provided yet another assist for a team-mate after appearing to buy a car boot's-worth of fellow full-back Andy Robertson's new book.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old posted a photo on Twitter of his car piled with copies of the Scot's 'Robbo: Now You're Gonna Believe Us: Our Year, My Story' autobiography that was released this week.</p>

<p>The England international posted the photo with the caption 'Anything to help Robbo’s book sales...' as if to suggest Robertson would struggle to sell copies of his new release.  </p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold has poked fun at Andy Robertson's release of a new autobiography</p>

<p>The England international posted a photo of his car boot full of copies to help out with sales</p>

<p>It is the latest in a line of jibes between the two friends — with the Liverpool pair often battling to out-do each other both off and on the pitch. </p>

<p>The Premier League-winning full-backs were in a constant battle to provide more assists than the other last season, with Alexander-Arnold's 15 edging out Robertson's still impressive tally of 12. </p>

<p>During lockdown, Robertson took four screenshots of the calendar reminders he has jokingly set on his phone, and a lot of them had something to do with his fellow Liverpool full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold.</p>

<p>Part of Robertson's 'to-do list' involved calling the Liverpool right-back twice in the morning, namely at 8:25am to say good morning and then again at 9:05am to 'check he's ok'. </p>

<p>The Scotland left-back shared screenshots  of his 'to-do list' on his Twitter page</p>

<p>The Scotland captain's new book will detail Liverpool's long-awaited Premier League title victory after 30 years last season through the eyes of Robertson.</p>

<p>The left-back, along with Alexander-Arnold, was an integral part of a relentless Liverpool side that finished 18 points above their nearest rivals on 99 points. </p>
