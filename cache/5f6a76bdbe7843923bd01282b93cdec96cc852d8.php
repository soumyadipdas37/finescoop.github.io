<p>Eye-popping cleavage: Georgia Harrison has unveiled the results of her boob job</p>

<p>The television personality told Closer Magazine: 'I'd see myself on TV wearing swimwear and think, "Oh, my boobs don't look good", and it made me feel very self-conscious.'</p>

<p>Georgia went on to say she would limit what she would, only opting for padded tops or tops with high necklines.</p>

<p>Explaining why she had surgery, the reality star said: 'I'm around 8.5st now, but when I was about 19 I was nearer 12st and my boobs were a lot bigger, I was working abroad and had a really unhealthy lifestyle, and I'd drink and just eat junk.'</p>

<p>Unconfident: She said: 'I'd see myself on TV wearing swimwear and think, "Oh, my boobs don't look good", and it made me feel very self-conscious' (pictured in 2017)</p>

<p>'But when my weight dropped a bit, so did my boobs, it looked like there was space to fill. I also had a problem with inverted nipples that I wanted to fix.' </p>

<p>And Georgia certainly appeared delighted with the bigger breasts as she showed them off on Instagram.</p>

<p>The blonde beauty put on a sizzling display in cream lingerie and a matching thong. </p>

<p>Georgia first found fame with a brief stint on The Only Way Is Essex in 2014, before becoming a household name with an appearance on 2017's Love Island.</p>

<p>The bubbly reality star then gained an American fanbase when she starred in series 33 of The Challenge in 2018, reaching the final and finishing in eighth place.</p>

<p>The Challenge saw reality stars from around the world come together to compete in a series of physical and mental challenges in the hope of the scooping prize money.</p>

<p>During her time on the show she was involved in a tumultuous relationship with fellow Brit and Ex On The Beach star Stephen Bear, a storyline that dominated much of the series.</p>

<p>A year later, Georgia's quest for love continued as she signed up to Celebrity Ex On The Beach.</p>

<p>She was previously in a relationship with Sam Gowland, who starred on the same series of Love Island as her and then went on to have an on-off relationship with Chloe Ferry on Geordie Shore.</p>
