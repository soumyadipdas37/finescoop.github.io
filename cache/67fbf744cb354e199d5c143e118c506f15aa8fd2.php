<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A skier came across a surprising sight in a remote area of the Italian Alps - the preserved remains of a 400-year-old goat.</p>

<p>With only half of its body sticking out of the ice, Hermann Oberlechner said the animal's skin 'looked like leather, completely hairless.'  </p>

<p>Oberlechner had hiked six hours into the mountains, so an army helicopter had to airlift the carcass out in a specially designed case.</p>

<p>Scientists will now examine the creature, known as a chamois, in hopes of improving conservation techniques for other so-called 'ice mummies,' including Ötzi, the famous 5,300-year-old 'Iceman' found by hikers in the Italian Alps in 1991. </p>

<p>Hermann Oberlechner discovered the 400-year-old remains of a chamois while hiking in South Tyrol. He said the animal's skin 'looked like leather, completely hairless' </p>

<p>Oberlechner, a champion skier, was hiking in Ahrntal in South Tyrol near the Italian-Austrian border when he spied the remains.</p>

<p>At first he thought it was just another animal carcass, a not-uncommon sight for the veteran outdoorsman. </p>

<p>Upon closer inspection, he realized he'd stumbled across something extraordinary.</p>

<p>'Only half of the animal's body was exposed from the snow,' Oberlechner said in a statement.</p>

<p>Hermann Oberlechner found the carcass 10,500 feet above sea level in a section of the Alps that's inaccessible to road vehicles. So researchers build a custom case and had it helicoptered out by the Alpine Army Corp</p>

<p>'The skin looked like leather, completely hairless. I had never seen anything like it.'</p>

<p>He quickly notified a park ranger and they contacted the Department of Cultural Heritage.</p>

<p>But Oberlechner was 10,500 feet above sea level in a section of the Alps that's inaccessible to road vehicles.</p>

<p>So the department called the Alpine Army Corps, who sent in a helicopter flown by a pilot trained to operate at high altitude.</p>

<p>The specimen was placed inside a custom-made case and hooked to the copter before being taken to Eurac Research's conservation lab in Bolzano, Italy.</p>

<p>While they are encased in a glacier, these 'ice mummies' are perfectly preserved. But as the temperature drops their DNA begins to degrade quickly. Experts say more specimens will be discovered as global warming continues</p>

<p>The chamois' remarkable state of preservation will allow researchers to improve conservation techniques for ice mummies, which can offer a wealth of scientific information. It is being stored at Eurac Research's conservation lab at 23 degrees Fahrenheit</p>

<p>To ensure it's preserved, the carcass is being stored in a refrigerated cell at 23 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>At first Hermann Oberlechner (pictured)  thought he was just looking at the recent remains of a wild animal</p>

<p>'This is the first time an animal mummy has been used in this way,' said Albert Zink, director of Eurac's Institute for Mummy Studies.</p>

<p>In 1991, the 5,300-year-old body of Ötzi, the famed 'Iceman,' was discovered by German tourists in Fineilspitze, about 110 miles away from Ahrntal.</p>

<p>The chamois is an agile herbivore with short, hooked horns that is still found in mountainous areas of Europe and Western Asia.</p>

<p>Typically less than four-and-half-feet long, they have rich brown fur that turns light grey in winter.</p>

<p>It's not clear if the remains found by Oberlechner are of a male or female.</p>

<p>While males are usually solitary, females and their young live in herds of up to 30.</p>

<p>Chamois were once hunted by lynxes and wolves, but their main predator today is humans.</p>

<p>They're no easy prey, though: Chamois can run faster than 30mph and leap 6.6 feet straight in the air.</p>

<p>It's not clear how this chamois died - it had been preserved for centuries and only recently became visible as the ice receded.</p>

<p>Experts say such finds will become increasingly common if climate change continues unabated.</p>

<p>Since his discovery on 19 December 1991 by German hikers, Ötzi (artist's impression) has provided window into early human history.</p>

<p>Since his discovery on 19 December 1991 by German hikers, Ötzi has provided window into early human history.</p>

<p>His mummified remains were uncovered in melting glacier in the mountainous border between Austria and Italy.</p>

<p>Analysis of the body has told us that he was alive during the Copper Age and died a grisly death. </p>

<p>Ötzi, who was 46 at the time of his death, had brown eyes, relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant.</p>

<p>He was also predisposed to heart disease.</p>

<p>In 2015, experts discovered a total of 61 tattoos on Ötzi's body using different wavelengths of light to pick them out on the mummy's darkened skin.</p>

<p>More recent research has focused on the DNA in the nuclei of Ötzi's cells, which could yield further insights into the famous ice mummy's life. </p>

<p>Scientists examining the contents of his stomach have also worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat.</p>

<p>Archaeologists believe Ötzi, who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper axe, may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe.</p>

<p>Researchers say he was about 5ft 2.5 inches (159cm) tall, 46 years old, arthritic and infested with whipworm - an intestinal parasite.</p>

<p>His perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a constant temperature of -6°C (21°F).</p>

<p>Visitors can view the mummy through a small window.</p>

<p>Alongside his remains is an Ötzi model created using 3D images of the corpse and forensic technology by two Dutch artists - Alfons and Adrie Kennis. </p>
