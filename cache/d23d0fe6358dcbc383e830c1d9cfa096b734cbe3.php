<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Taylor Swift has become one of the biggest names in music, all while navigating a male-dominated industry.</p>

<p>And the 10-time Grammy winner took a jab at some of that toxic masculinity with her music video for The Man, which she directed herself. </p>

<p>She accepted the Video Music Award for Best Direction from home during Sunday's awards show on MTV for the promo, making her the first ever female solo artist to win the award. </p>

<p>Winner winner: Taylor Swift accepted the Video Music Award for Best Direction from home during Sunday's awards show on MTV</p>

<p>Directorial debut: The 30-year-old landed the award after making her directorial debut back in February with the video for The Man</p>

<p>The 30-year-old looked effortlessly chic in a fresh-faced glam look and a casual blue button-down shirt.</p>

<p>She said in her speech: 'Guys, this is amazing. This is the first video I've ever directed on my own and I just - I'm so grateful for this. I want to take an opportunity to say thank you for the team who believed in me as a first-time director and made this video with me. </p>

<p>'My DP, my AD, my editor, Ethan, Joe, Bill and his team for turning me into a guy, which was very thrilling. I also want to thank two women that I'd worked with convinced me that I was up to the challenge of directing on my own and those women were my producers on this video, Rebecca Skinner and Jil Hardin. Thank you for that.' </p>

<p>Swift continued: 'I was told this was an industry voted award so I want to say thank you to everyone in the industry who voted for this video. I also really want to thank the fans because you are the only reason the industry cares about anything that I do and everything that you have done this summer.</p>

<p>So grateful: She said in her speech: 'Guys, this is amazing. This is the first video I've ever directed on my own and I just -- I'm so grateful for this'</p>

<p>Fan favorite: Swift continued: 'I also really want to thank the fans because you are the only reason the industry cares about anything that I do and everything that you have done this summer'</p>

<p>Taylor Swift may not have attended MTV's Video Music Awards in person, but virtually she made a stylish appearance.</p>

<p>The singer earned her stripes to win Best Direction and also wore stripes for the occasion in the form of Derek Lam 10 Crosby's shirt dress.</p>

<p>The blue shirt is a classic summer staple, but this one has been given a modern update with the knit panel that gives the impression you've taken off your jumper and tried it around your waist. Something you may have seen the Hadid sisters or even Kendall Jenner doing.</p>

<p>She beat out Billie Eilish, Doja Cat, Dua Lipa, Harry Styles and The Weeknd for the honor, the second award of the evening. </p>

<p>Swift received a total of six nominations at this year's virtual awards show, including Video of the Year and Video for Good, both for The Man.</p>

<p>She embraced her inner bro back in February, when she did full drag and prosthetics for the music video, which featured the voice of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson as her male alter ego.</p>

<p>The former country star said on YouTube of the five-hour transformation: 'It's been a joy. I had no idea what they do to your body to make you look different.'</p>

<p>Going for gold: Swift received a total of six nominations at this year's virtual awards show, including Video of the Year and Video for Good, both for The Man</p>

<p>Gender flip: She embraced her inner bro back in February, when she did full drag and prosthetics for the music video from her seventh studio album Lover, which dropped last August</p>

<p>Male-dominated industry: She told Billboard of the song: 'It was a song that I wrote from my personal experience, but also from a general experience that I’ve heard from women in all parts of our industry'</p>

<p>She added: 'I've never thought about how men walk. It's never something that's interested me before but, you know, they walk differently than we do.'</p>

<p>Swift told Billboard of the song: 'It was a song that I wrote from my personal experience, but also from a general experience that I’ve heard from women in all parts of our industry. And I think that, the more we can talk about it in a song like that, the better off we’ll be in a place to call it out when it’s happening. </p>

<p>'So many of these things are ingrained in even women, these perceptions, and it’s really about re-training your own brain to be less critical of women when we are not criticizing men for the same things.'</p>

<p>It came amid an ongoing feud with music manager Scooter Braun, with whom she's been in a battle over the rights to her past music. </p>

<p>Swift has recently dropped her eighth studio album Folklore, which has spent five consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200. </p>
