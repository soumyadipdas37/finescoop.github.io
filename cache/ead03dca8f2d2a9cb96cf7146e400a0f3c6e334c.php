<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Novak Djokovic's has been fined an additional $10,000 (£7,600) for 'unsportsmanlike behaviour' following his dramatic disqualification from the US Open on Sunday night.  </p>

<p>Djokovic, who has already been stripped of his $250,000 (£190,000) in prize money for reaching the last-16, was given a further punishment by tournament organisers for his actions on court against Spaniard Pablo Carreno Busta.</p>

<p>The world No 1 was broken for 5-6 in the opening set and petulantly  swiped a ball away that struck a female line judge, Laura Clark, in the throat.</p>

<p>Djokovic pleaded his case for leniency to tournament officials but referee Soeren Friemel, who was summoned onto court inside the deserted Arthur Ashe Stadium by umpire Aurelie Tourte, told Djokovic, after plenty of debate, that there was no option but to disqualify him. </p>
