<p>Big news? Yazmin Oukhellou shocked her on-off beau James Lock as she revealed she might be pregnant in a dramatic teaser clip at the end of Wednesday's episode of TOWIE</p>

<p>Yaz looked serious as she told a stony-faced Lockie: 'I don't know how to say this, but I potentially could be pregnant' in the short clip.  </p>

<p>Although not yet mentioning the possibility of a baby on the way to her pals, Yaz did speak about possibly starting a family with Lockie several times during the show.  </p>

<p>While speaking with mother-of-two Amy Childs, the brunette beauty admitted that she was 'excited for the future' </p>

<p>When Amy asked if she'd thought about babies yet, Yaz smiled as she replied 'you never know'. </p>

<p>Dad-to-be? Lockie appeared tense as he listened to Yaz's bombshell news </p>

<p>During Wednesday's episode Yaz and Lockie were seen working on their relationship, with him asking her to be more romantic.</p>

<p>While out having a drink with the boys Lockie texted his girlfriend saying: 'Coming to yours tomorrow, want some romance. Get your creative juices flowing'.</p>

<p>However this interesting use of words didn't impress Yaz and Amy, who were enjoying a girls pamper night.    </p>

<p>Oh baby! The beauty was also seen hiding a Clearblue pregnancy test in her bag while at Gatsby's birthday party</p>

<p>Keeping a secret? Yaz reached into her bag at while chatting with her pals during the party</p>

<p>Amy said: 'Come on, he needs to do it to you! He should be cooking you dinner, putting petals on your bed.. you're a princess Yaz!'</p>

<p>Sweetly admitting Lockie had been putting in the extra effort recently, Yaz replied: 'I've never really had that. But today he actually washed my car.. but it kinda looks dirtier than before'.  </p>

<p>Later in the show Yaz proved she was serious about giving things another try with Lockie by penning him a hilarious love poem.  </p>

<p>The couple met up with their pals Amber Turner, Dan Edger, Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallet where Yazmin proudly read out her poem.</p>

<p>Coming up: The couple decided to give their relationship another try this year and have previously said they're having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom</p>

<p>Announcing to the group she had penned the piece about her beau, friend Amber said: 'You can't just do that and not read it to us! We want to hear it.' </p>

<p>Yazmin then took out a notebook and read aloud: 'Oh James, James, I'm sick of these wine games.  Lockie, you're looking a little bit stocky. Why are you always so cocky? </p>

<p>'You look good in pink, but your feet really stink.  You've got good chat but sometimes you're a t**t.  </p>

<p>'I love your golden tan, you're a very handsome man. I love the way you look at me like a character from Glee. </p>

<p>Heartfelt: Yazmin penned a hilarious love poem to show her appreciation for her boyfriend James on the latest episode of The Only Way Is Essex</p>

<p>'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids.'  </p>

<p>Yazmin had dumped Lockie over claims he had cheated on her while they were on a romantic holiday together in Turkey, and has said she still doesn't trust him but wouldn't say 'no' if he popped the question.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, the brunette beauty said: 'We are trying to take things really slow but I know what I am like.</p>

<p>Hilarious: The couple met up with their pals Amber Turner, Dan Edger, Georgia Kousoulou and Tommy Mallet where Yazmin proudly read out her poem</p>

<p>'I do love him and if he did propose to me I would say yes and marry him. I still don't trust him but I do trust him more this time, which is strange because he messed up. But I do believe he has changed.'</p>

<p>Yazmin also revealed that the couple are now having weekly therapy sessions via Zoom after starting during lockdown, which is helping get their broken relationship back on track. </p>

<p>She added that her family and friends around her are still sceptical about the reunion but that she needs to 'prove everyone wrong'.</p>

<p>Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.</p>

<p>Yazmin read: 'I know that Pete gets jealous of our love that is oh so precious. But the bottom line is, you think I'm the biz and I can't wait to get married and have kids' </p>
