<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The number of people dying of Covid-19 in England and Wales rose for the first time in five months in September.</p>

<p>Office for National Statistics data published today showed that 99 people were killed by the disease in the week ending September 11, up from 78 a week earlier.</p>

<p>Although still the second lowest number of registered deaths since March, the 27 per cent rise could show a change in the downward trend that lasted for 20 weeks.</p>

<p>The ONS count chimes with official numbers of deaths announced each day by the Department of Health – that daily average began to rise again on September 7 from seven per day to 22 a day yesterday. </p>

<p>All signs point to the virus rebounding in Britain now that lockdown rules have lifted and the Government's chief scientists warned yesterday that the nation must act.</p>

<p>The UK could see a crisis-level 200 deaths per day in November if action isn't taken soon to stem the rising tide of cases, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance warned.</p>

<p>The ONS report did not commit to warning of a rise in Covid-19 deaths as it has with cases, but issued a caveat that the August bank holiday may have meant the previous week's deaths were unrealistically low.</p>
