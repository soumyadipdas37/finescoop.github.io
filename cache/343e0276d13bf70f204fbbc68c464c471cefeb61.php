<p>The Gunners are eager to secure deal for Aouar before the transfer window closes on October 5, and Aubameyang described the 22-year-old as 'a very good player'. </p>

<p>Mikel Arteta's side are to make an improved £34m bid for Aouar this week but have been warned it will fall short of his £45m value by Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas.</p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has urged Arsenal to secure a deal for Lyon's Houssem Aouar</p>

<p>Arsenal captain Aubameyang described Aouar as 'a very good player' who could help the team</p>

<p>'He's a very good player,' Aubameyang said, as reported by The Mirror. 'I hope we will be lucky to have these types of players at the club, I'm sure he can bring a lot to us.</p>

<p>'I hope he will come even though he is at Lyon.'  </p>

<p>Arsenal had an initial offer of £32m rejected for Aouar but won't give up easily in their quest to sign him.</p>

<p>Mikel Arteta's Arsenal are set to make an improved offer of £34m for Aouar this week</p>

<p>If he was to join, the Frenchman would help to provide Arsenal's midfield with some much-needed creativity.</p>

<p>Aubameyang recently committed his future to Arsenal, signing a three-year deal, and bringing in a player of Aouar's quality would help to vindicate his decision to stay.</p>

<p>Aouar made his 100th Ligue 1 appearance for Lyon on Sunday as his side drew 1-1 with Lorient.  </p>

<p>Arsenal have also been pursuing a deal for Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey, but at present a deal for Aouar appears much more attainable.  </p>
