<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> IT’S the unfinished Michelangelo masterpiece that experts reckon may be worth up to £100million.</p>

<p>But the Royal Academy may have to sell its prized marble sculpture as 150 gallery staff face redundancy, it is claimed.</p>

<p>The 515-year-old sculpture, known as the Taddei Tondo, was given to the London gallery in 1829 to inspire the academy’s schools after the death of owner Lady Margaret Beaumont.</p>

<p>Like many arts institutions, the Royal Academy has seen its finances badly hit by the pandemic and has been forced to consider lay-offs.</p>

<p>Masterpiece: A gallery staff member with the Michelangelo Taddei Tondo</p>

<p>As a result, a group of Royal Academicians could argue that instead of cutting jobs, the institution should consider selling the Tondo – the only marble sculpture by Michelangelo in the UK.</p>

<p>One anonymous Academician told The Observer: ‘The sale of the Tondo has already been discussed. </p>

<p>It is worth so much, it could save jobs and get the RA out of the financial mess they have got themselves into.’</p>

<p>The sculpture’s value remains a closely guarded secret but in 2017 The Art Newspaper claimed that it would fetch at least £100million if sold.</p>

<p>It has been reported that those at the Royal Academy who support the controversial rescue suggestion have called for a special meeting. </p>

<p>But, it is said, they have been met with resistance from president Rebecca Salter, and from the executive, apparently ‘horrified’ by the idea of selling something so iconic.</p>

<p>It is hoped by some Academicians that the suggested sale will be discussed at a virtual annual general meeting of members due this week. </p>

<p>But a spokesman for the RA told The Observer it ‘has no intention of selling any works in its collection’.</p>

<p>The Taddei Tondo, featuring the infant St John the Baptist, and the infant Christ with the Virgin Mary, was carved  between 1504 and 1505.</p>
