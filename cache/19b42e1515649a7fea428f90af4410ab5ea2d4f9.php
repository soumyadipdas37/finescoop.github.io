<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arizona Cardinals safety Budda Baker has revealed the vile, racist, and threatening messages he received from a 49ers fan after unintentionally injuring San Francisco tight end George Kittle in the Week 1 opener.</p>

<p>'Wasup monkey a** n*****,' read one message. 'You got get a blunt on yo f*<strong>in monkey a</strong> head you f***in dirty n*****.'</p>

<p>The sender accused Baker of 'tryna go after the knees' on the tackle, which left Kittle with a sprained knee. The All-Pro tight end still managed to finish the second half after going into the locker room in the second quarter to have his knee examined.</p>

<p>Despite Kittle's recovery, Baker still found himself targeted by the racist social media user with the name 'niners8.'</p>

<p>'Get on your knees you f***ing slave,' Baker's antagonist continued.</p>

<p>The messages were sent to Baker from someone using the handle 'niners8' on SundayÂ </p>

<p>Baker posted the messages while tweeting 'all you can do is pray for people like this'</p>

<p>Baker's hit on Kittle did not appear to be a dirty tackle. Rather, a high throw from 49ers quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo forced Kittle to jump for the screen pass, making him an easy target for a hard, clean hit from Baker</p>

<p>Baker responded on Twitter alongside a grab of the exchange.</p>

<p>'Im all good with opposing fans talking trash,' he wrote. 'But This right here man... All you can do is pray for ppl like this.'</p>

<p>The Niners will see how Kittle feels Wednesday before deciding his fate this week.</p>

<p>Baker, a two-time Pro Bowler, agreed to terms on a $59 million, four-year contract extension in August that put him among the NFL's highest-paid safeties.</p>

<p>'It's a great thing that this happened, I'm truly blessed that this happened,' Baker said. 'Now the full focus is on getting my teammates better and getting the team better and hopefully getting some more W's.'</p>

<p>The 5-foot-10, 195-pound Baker played in college at Washington and was drafted in the second round in 2017. The 24-year-old has quickly become a young cornerstone for the Cardinals' defense and led all NFL defensive backs with 147 tackles last season, including 104 solo tackles.</p>

<p>Baker's rookie contract was set to expire after this season, but now he's under contract through 2024.</p>
