<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud has revealed that he almost joined bitter rivals Tottenham in January as he was desperate to leave Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old was linked with a move away from the club in the winter transfer window after being frozen out for two months.</p>

<p>Giroud, who joined Chelsea from London rivals Arsenal in 2018, has now admitted that he wanted a departure so badly that he almost made the move back to north London, but this time to Spurs.</p>

<p>Forward Olivier Giroud has opened up on coming close to leaving Chelsea in January</p>

<p>Giroud revealed that he almost joined Jose Mourinho's Tottenham in winter transfer window</p>

<p>'During the last three days of the transfer window, I was in the coach's office to find a solution. I was hoping Chelsea would find a replacement for me,' he told So Foot, as reported by Goal.</p>

<p>'For my part, it was not the solutions that were lacking: I almost signed for Lazio, Inter… I was even so determined to leave that I even almost signed for Tottenham!' </p>

<p>A transfer failed to materialise for Giroud as Chelsea's own search for another striker was unsuccessful but he has since won his first-team place back under manager Frank Lampard.</p>

<p>Striker Giroud scored the opening goal in Chelsea's 2-1 win over Spurs a month later</p>

<p>A month after almost exiting Chelsea he scored the opening goal in their 2-1 victory over Jose Mourinho's Tottenham side.</p>

<p>Following the resumption of the top flight after the coronavirus shutdown Giroud was in a rich vein in form and his goals helped fire them to the top four. </p>

<p>The forward, who was an unused substitute in Chelsea's 3-1 win over Brighton in their first match this campaign, signed a contract extension at the club until the end of the 2020-21 season in May.</p>
