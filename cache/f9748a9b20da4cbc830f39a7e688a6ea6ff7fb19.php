<p>They jetted straight from a holiday in Spain to Scotland last month and brazenly posted about it on Instagram.</p>

<p>The Glaswegian car repair specialist is said to have exchanged a series of messages with healthcare assistant Caitlin Fulton, who claims she learned of his blossoming romance with Rebecca when she saw pictures of them kissing.</p>

<p>'We'd been messaging back and forth after he followed me on Instagram and we'd talked about going away when lockdown ended, to a holiday cottage or a lodge somewhere in the UK,' she told The Sun. </p>

<p>Coming up: The reality star ordered her treat from a hatch outside one of the town's cafes</p>

<p>'He even left me a voice note saying that coming down to see me "sounded good". We were making plans as recently as Saturday.' </p>

<p>Caitlin told the publication that she learned of Biggs' relationship with Rebecca when she saw photographs of them kissing in Newcastle.</p>

<p>'I was a bit shocked that he had a girlfriend,' she said. 'And obviously I would be shocked if that was my boyfriend messaging someone.'</p>

<p>The couple split up briefly before lockdown after she had a drunken sleepover with Love Island 2019 contestant Michael Griffiths. </p>
