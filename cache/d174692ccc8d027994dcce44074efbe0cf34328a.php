<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>AFL WAG Rebecca Judd was shocked this week to hear that Americans don't use kettles. </p>

<p>Speaking on her KIIS FM radio show, the 3pm Pick Up on Tuesday, Rebecca said it's 'weird' that they instead microwave their water.</p>

<p>'Having a kettle is like a way of life, you use it for so much more than having a tea,' Rebecca said. </p>

<p>'I'm shook, it's a way of life': This week, Rebecca Judd was shocked to discover Americans don't use a VERY common kitchen item that's a staple in Aussie households</p>

<p>Rebecca said she first found out that they don't use kettles on Instagram, as she follows an Australian author who has a big American following.  </p>

<p>'Something slid into her DMs from one of her American followers and it's the fact that Americans don't have kettles. This is weird,' Bec said. </p>

<p>She added: 'It's more than just the tea, having a kettle is like a way of life, you use it for so much more than having a tea.'</p>

<p>Say what? Rebecca said the discovery left her 'shook'</p>

<p>The mother-of-four said she likes to use her kettle to make cups of noodles, to dissolve chicken stock, and to water her indoor plants. </p>

<p>She then shared an audio clip of Kim Kardashian saying she has two kettles in her home, but Kim wasn't aware that the 'pots' are called kettles.</p>

<p>'Kim, it's a kettle!' Bec said with a laugh.</p>

<p>Bec lives a $7.3million mansion in Brighton, Melbourne, with husband Chris Judd and their four children, son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins Tom and Darcy, three.</p>

<p>Rebecca and Chris have been married for 10 years.</p>

<p>In recent weeks they've been stuck in lockdown at home, due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Last month, Bec admitted on her radio show that she's over the stage-four restrictions and can't wait to travel interstate for a holiday.</p>

<p>It came after the 37-year-old kicked her three-year-old twin sons, Tom and Darcy, outside after they trashed her stylish living room.</p>

<p>'I'm done... I'm out,' Bec said. </p>

<p>Melbourne has been under stage-four lockdown since August 2, following a spike in coronavirus cases in the state of Victoria.</p>

<p>Residents can only leave their homes for food and essential items, daily exercise, care for others, and work if they cannot work from home.</p>
