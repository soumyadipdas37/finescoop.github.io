<p>An Australian home baker has impressed other foodies online after sharing how she made delicious scones (left) in her 3.2 litre air fryer from Kmart (right)</p>

<p>To make the fresh scones, Jezzica used flour, butter and milk and preheated the air fryer for five minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>In a bowl, she first added the butter into the flour and mixed with her hands 'until it resembled bread crumbs'.</p>

<p>She then made a well in the middle of the flour, added in the milk and combined together to create the dough.</p>

<p>After kneading a dough, she made the scones shapes with a two-centimetre thickness and cooked in the air fryer for ten minutes.</p>

<p>The recipe is simple to follow, uses only three ingredients and only takes ten minutes to make, including flour, butter and milk </p>

<p>'You can't beat a scone for an easy, yummy snack,' one woman said.</p>
