<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Edouard Mendy's imminent move to Chelsea is reportedly being held up by Rennes who have made a last-minute demand to include Fikayo Tomori in the deal.</p>

<p>Mendy is set to become the seventh signing in an extraordinary summer of spending for Chelsea after Sportsmail revealed at the weekend they had agreed a £25million fee with the Ligue 1 side.</p>

<p>But while the details are being finalised, Rennes are now hoping to receive Tomori in return as they look to squeeze a little more out of the west London club, according to French news outlet Telefoot.</p>

<p>Edouard Mendy's imminent £25million move to Chelsea has been held up by Rennes</p>

<p>Tomori, who has been linked with a loan move away from Stamford Bridge in recent weeks, has fallen down the pecking order at Chelsea following the arrival of Thiago Silva earlier this summer.</p>

<p>Tomori has also been linked with a loan move with Everton but now Rennes are hoping to bring him in. </p>

<p>As a result of the late negotiations, Mendy has returned to training with the French club as he looks to keep up his fitness levels ahead of his switch. </p>

<p>Rennes now want Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori included as part of the deal for Mendy</p>

<p>Rennes have also reportedly tried to get Olivier Giroud as part of the deal for Mendy but the move was rejected by the Blues. </p>

<p>Mendy was initially pulled out of training on Friday after Chelsea's bid was accepted and was subsequently left out of Rennes' 4-2 victory against Nimes on Sunday. </p>

<p>He looks set to provide immediate competition for under-fire Kepa Arrizabalaga and Willy Caballero.</p>

<p>Chelsea conceded 54 goals in 38 Premier League games last season and manager Frank Lampard wants Mendy to help eradicate such a poor record.</p>

<p>And the Chelsea boss may already been vindicated in his decision to sign Mendy after Spaniard Kepa made another blunder in their 3-1 win at Brighton. </p>

<p>Mendy will compete with Kepa Arrizabalaga, who made another blunder in the Brighton win</p>

<p>Leandro Trossard made it 1-1 when his long-range left-footed strike flew underneath the body of the 25-year-old on Monday evening, which according to Squawka was the 19th Premier League goal scored from outside the box he has conceded since arriving in England.</p>

<p>However, despite admitting after the game he remains happy with Kepa, Lampard appears close to signing Mendy. </p>

<p>The previous record fee for a goalkeeper moving from France to England was the £12.3m Chelsea paid to Rennes in 2004 for Petr Cech, who is now Chelsea's technical director and played a key role in Mendy's selection.</p>
