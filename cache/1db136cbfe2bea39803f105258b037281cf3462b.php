<p>The Design Hotels website, designhotels.com, says of the architecture: 'Contemporary architectural design mixes harmoniously with rustic touches throughout the resort, with modern-style buildings fashioned using Maldivian influences. Though formidable, spacious, and embracing on the inside, the private villas are constructed with natural thatch roofs and light, unassuming exteriors that enable them to disappear into the surrounding natural flora.'</p>
