<p>Hilarious video footage shows miniature English Bull Terrier Fidget 'faking her own death' when she realises it is time to go home after a walk in Hinckley, Leicestershire</p>

<p>Ms Harland is heard saying: 'Can we go home? Fidge come on!' </p>

<p>But Fidget pretends not to hear her frustrated owner and longingly glances back down the road instead.</p>

<p>After a hysterical protest, Fidget becomes bored and decided to leap up, provoking cries of delight from her owner.</p>

<p>Ms Harland said that concerned members of the public regularly stop to check on the well-being off the stubborn mutt after seeing Fidget's antics.</p>

<p>The owner was even forced to take to social media to reassure people that her dog was not unwell or injured, after many residents offered to take Fidget to the vets.</p>

<p>The mother-of-one added: 'I've had a few people stop thinking she is hurt. Two or three cars over the year have slowed down when they see her lying down to check she is alright.</p>

<p>'Three weeks ago a man stopped and asked if she was OK and if we needed a lift to the vet.'</p>

<p>Ms Harland said that she had spent a year thinking that Fidget's behaviour was 'normal' but after sharing her dog's antics on social media, quickly realised it was not.</p>

<p>Ms Harland said that residents often think Fidget is unwell and offer to drive the stubborn pooch to the vets after witnessing her hilarious spectacle</p>

<p>The hilarious video proved so popular that she set up a dedicated social media page for Fidget, which racked up hundreds of followers in just one week.</p>

<p>Sharon, who a dog groomer, said: 'On the way back from walking my little boy into school in the morning, it comes to a point when she knows it's home time.</p>

<p>'She refuses to move when she's only three minutes away from home. She will just lay down, put the brakes on, sit down and refuses to move.</p>

<p>'If you pull her on the lead she lies flat or wriggles. She wriggles like a worm and twists round so I can't pick her up.</p>

<p>'She does it for a few minutes at a time. It's quite typical of her breed - they are very stubborn.</p>

<p>'She finds it hilarious but after a while she gets bored with her nonsense and stands up.</p>

<p>'I tried giving her treats when she gets up, but now she'll lay down in the middle of a walk to get one, so I've had to stop that trick.' </p>

<p>Ms Harland and partner Tor Stovold, 36, a mechanic, got Fidget when she was eight weeks old and she first started playing dead about a year ago. </p>

<p>Ms Harland said: 'We called her Fidget because she doesn't stop - apart from when she's trying to fake her own death of course.</p>

<p>'She's naughty and will run round at home after swallowing a sock. When our internet went down we realised she had chewed through the internet cable.'</p>

<p>Her original post on the Spotted Hinckley Facebook group has received 1,700 likes and 198 comments since September 17.</p>

<p>Alongside a picture of Fidget lying on her back, she wrote: 'If you see my dog sprawled out at the side of the road, looking like a RTA victim, she is absolutely fine.</p>

<p>'She just doesn't want to go home.</p>

<p>'I do appreciate the concern from the public, but we do not need a lift to the vets. She just thinks she's hilarious.'</p>
