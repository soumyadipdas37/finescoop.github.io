<p>She said: 'Jenson was away when I found out, and I wanted to tell him face-to face so I waited until he returned home.</p>

<p>'It was so hard to not say anything on the phone but I thought it was more special to do it in person. I gave him a little gift box with the test in it and he started crying.</p>

<p>'It was a very sweet moment. It was exactly what you would want the father of your future child to do.' </p>
