<p>A savvy home cook has shared how she made delicious fried ice cream using her 3.2 litre Kmart air fryer</p>

<p>Posting to an Australian cookery group, mum Stephii was inspired by her parents who used to make the dessert when they owned a Chinese restaurant</p>

<p>Stephii made the dessert by following a simple YouTube video and used four ingredients - eggs, ice cream, desiccated coconut and sponge cake.</p>

<p>The video begins by shaping the ice cream into a seven-centimetre ball using an ice cream scoop.</p>

<p>The sponge cake is then wrapped around the ice cream ensuring it is fully closed.</p>

<p>The ball is rolled in the egg wash followed by the coconut before being placed on a lined tray to be placed in the freezer for four hours. </p>

<p>After four hours have passed, the air fryer was preheated for ten minutes at 200 degrees Celsius.</p>

<p>The ice cream balls were then sprayed with a small amount of oil and placed into the air fryer for four minutes.</p>

<p>Stephii added a chocolate topping with mint and sliced strawberries on the side.</p>
