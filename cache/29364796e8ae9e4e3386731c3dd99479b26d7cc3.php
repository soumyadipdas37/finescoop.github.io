<p>However, many retailers seemed to jump the gun and offer the gaming console earlier- even without having any physical systems. </p>

<p>GameStop shared a news release stating it was now taking pre-orders for the PS5 Wednesday evening and quickly ran out of stock.</p>

<p>Target also sold out and is encouraging consumers to check back on the official release date of November 12. </p>

<p>'We'll make every effort to get the item to you as soon as possible once released.'</p>
