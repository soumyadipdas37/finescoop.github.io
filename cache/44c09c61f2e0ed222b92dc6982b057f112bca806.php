<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A former US Navy pilot is opening up about his infamous alleged UFO sighting off the coast of California in 2004.</p>

<p>Commander David Fravor said he witnessed a Tic Tac-shaped object in the sky in November 10, 2004 performing extraordinary aerial maneuvers that he said no modern human technology was capable of.</p>

<p>'This is not like we saw it and it was gone or I saw lights in the sky and it's gone – we watched this thing on a crystal clear day with four trained observers,' Fravor said in a sit-down interview with Russian-American YouTuber and MIT researcher Lex Fridman on September 8. </p>

<p>He said the phenomena committed an 'act of war' by jamming the military's radar when they tried to trace it.</p>

<p>Former US Navy pilot Commander David Fravor along with three others reported a potential UFO sighting off the coast of California in 2004. He said on the sighting: 'I don't like to get into little green men but I don't think we've developed it ... I think you can hide things for a while. This is a giant leap in technology'</p>

<p>Video of what the Navy was able to trace of the object was leaked in 2017 and the case was declassified by the Pentagon earlier this year</p>

<p>Electronic jamming is a form of electronic warfare and is illegal in all 50 states. While it’s not always considered an act of war, it is interpreted as hostile.</p>

<p>Video of what the Navy was able to trace of the object was leaked in 2017 and the case was declassified by the Pentagon earlier this year. </p>

<p>Fravor and others were conducting a routine training mission when the radio operator asked them to check out a mysterious aircraft they had been tracking for two weeks.</p>

<p>The operator said the object would suddenly appear at 80,000 feet, hurtle towards the sea, hover at about 20,000 feet, then shoot back up into the sky. </p>

<p>Fravor and Commander Jim Slaight and two others were sent out in fighter jets to observe the shape. </p>

<p>'We see this little white Tic Tac because we’re about 20 feet above it and its going north, south, north, south, and it's abrupt,' he said.</p>

<p>He explained that it didn’t move like helicopters or other aircraft he was familiar with.</p>

<p>The operator said the object would suddenly appear at 80,000 feet, hurtle towards the sea, hover at about 20,000 feet, then shoot back up into the sky</p>

<p>'By this time we’re driving around and we’re just watching this thing and I go, "hey I’m gonna check it out,"' Fravor recalled. </p>

<p>'It’s aware of us and it goes bloop and start coming up, so it knows that we’re there. This is like five minutes,' he added. </p>

<p>'I’m going to meet it and I’m probably a half mile away and it’s coming across my nose …and it just accelerates and disappears at about 12,000 feet in less than a half second and it’s gone,' Fravor said.  </p>

<p>'I remember telling the guy in my back sat, "Dude, I dunno about you but I’m pretty weirded out,"' he said in the interview.</p>

<p>Fravor said he and the other jets went down towards the water to see what the object was potentially hovering around as they noticed white water when the object was over it, but it was 'clear blue' when they reached it.</p>

<p>Fravor said the object commited an 'act of war' by jamming Navy radars when they tried to track the object. The 18-year Navy pilot pictured above</p>

<p>After landing Fravor mentioned the UFO to colleague Chad Underwood who successfully located the unidentified object to get video on his radar. But when he attempted to trace the shape, the flying object jammed the radar.  </p>

<p>'When he first sees [the object] he gets an energy lock on it. When he goes to lock it up, now he’s putting a bunch of energy on it. He’s telling the radar, "Stare down the line of sight, whatever is there I want you to grab it and build a trace file on it," which will tell you where it is, how fast it is and the direction that it’s going,' Fravor said. </p>

<p>'The radar is smart enough that when the signal comes back if it's been messed with, it will tell you - it will give you indications that it's being jammed .... It's being jammed into about every mode you can see ... You can tell it's being jammed.</p>

<p>'When you actively jam another platform, yes it’s technically an act of war,' he added.</p>

<p>When asked if he believes that Tic Tac shape could've been from another planet, Fravor said it could be possible. </p>

<p>'I don't like to get into little green men but I don't think we've developed it ... I think you can hide things for a while. This is a giant leap in technology,' he said. </p>
