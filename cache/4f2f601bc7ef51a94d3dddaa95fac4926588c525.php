<p>She had been in the blockbusters like 1997's Starship Troopers and 1999's The World Is Not Enough.</p>

<p>Denise had also experienced a high-profile marriage to Charlie Sheen from 2002 to 2006. </p>

<p>Still standing: Now that Denise has exited the show, that leaves Kyle Richards, Erika Jayne, Lisa Rinna and Teddy Mellencamp, among others</p>

<p>She did it: 'She's answering her truth,' said Cohen. 'She has a family and kids. Whatever happened or didn't happen, I would imagine that it's something that maybe she didn't really care to discuss on a television show'</p>

<p>The other cast members did not support her but rather turned on the Wild Things actress.  </p>

<p>'She's answering her truth,' said Cohen. 'She has a family and kids. Whatever happened or didn't happen, I would imagine that it's something that maybe she didn't really care to discuss on a television show.' </p>
