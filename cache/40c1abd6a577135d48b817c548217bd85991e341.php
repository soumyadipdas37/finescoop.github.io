<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian mother-of-two Angela Simson had never struggled with irritating skin conditions, other than for a short period of time when she was 13.</p>

<p>But after separating from her husband at the end of 2018, the skin around her mouth, nose and chin quickly broke out in dermatitis and became inflamed.</p>

<p>'It felt like my face was on fire – it was hot, itchy and annoying,' Angela told FEMAIL.</p>

<p>At first the Gold Coast health coach, 32, didn't know what to do as her prescribed antibiotics and steroid creams only provided a short-term fix.</p>

<p>But she later turned to MooGoo's range of natural products - which helped clear her skin after just four months. </p>

<p>The Australian skincare brand is known specifically for treating skin issues such as eczema and psoriasis.</p>

<p>Mum Angela Simpson (pictured) experienced a 'hot, itchy and annoying' facial dermatitis after splitting from her husband at the end of 2018</p>

<p>'I have been using MooGoo for years and had been using the milky products on my daughter,' she said.</p>

<p>'So when this skin irritation came up on my face I thought this is basically what MooGoo is made for, so it was perfect.'</p>

<p>Angela first started using the $13.50 Natural Nappy Balm, which she had in the cupboard for her children, and said this initially helped to reduce the itching.</p>

<p>She then used the Eczema and Psoriasis Cream and Natural Soothing MSM Moisturiser to aid the dermatitis.</p>

<p>The MooGoo Eczema and Psoriasis Cream and Natural Soothing MSM Moisturiser helped clear her inflamed skin after two to three months, but the area around her nose took an additional four weeks</p>

<p>She also tried a range of other tactics to potentially help clear the skin faster, including removing red food from her diet, changing the shower filter and ate vegan berry antioxidants</p>

<p>The products helped clear her inflamed skin after two to three months, but the area around her nose took an additional four weeks.</p>

<p>Doctors couldn't determine how the skin condition occurred, but Angela deemed it to be stress-related.</p>

<p>'Still to this day I don't know what caused it - it could've been a reaction to using another product but it was most likely stress,' she said.</p>

<p>She also tried a range of other tactics to potentially help clear the skin faster, including removing red food from her diet, changing the shower filter and eating vegan berry antioxidants.</p>

<p>As MooGoo helped relieve Angela's skin, she highly recommends it to others who are experiencing similar symptoms. </p>

<p>The MSM cream is a lightweight moisturiser that easily sinks into the skin and is made with natural oils including sweet almond and coconut, while the eczema and psoriasis cream is specifically for the 'symptomatic relief of eczema, dermatitis and mild psoriasis'. </p>

<p>Australian skincare brand MooGoo is known specifically for treating skin issues such as eczema and psoriasis, so Angela knew it would work well</p>

<p>Melody Livingstone, MooGoo CEO, said the brand has seen a dramatic rise in the number of people suffering skin issues, especially over the last few months as a reaction to COVID lockdowns, stress and over washing hands. </p>

<p>Angela highly recommends MooGoo to others</p>

<p>'Australia has one of the highest incidences of dermatitis in the world, and it is only getting worse - 50 years ago, only one in ten Australian children suffered from it,' said Livingstone.</p>

<p>'It can develop for a number of reasons, including climate, lifestyle, hygiene and genetics, and can become easily infected, causing pain, inflammation and lack of sleep, and research shows the number of cases of dermatitis is on the rise worldwide, but we don't know why.</p>

<p>'There are more people with eczema than ever before and we're selling an eczema cream every two minutes. </p>

<p>'In Australia, we've had an increase in people contacting us for skin care advice as COVID-19 and its impacts have wreaked havoc on people suffering from skin issues, and the constant hand washing and use of hand sanitiser has caused dermatitis to flare,' she said.  </p>

<p>Customers can purchase MooGoo's products online and in pharmacies across Australia.  </p>
