<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jamie Carragher has called Fulham owner Tony Khan a 'clown' and insisted that Fulham are more likely to be relegated from the Premier League than Liverpool are to retain their title.</p>

<p>Former Liverpool and England centre-back Carragher watched Fulham put on a defensive horror show as they lost 3-0 at home to Aston Villa on Monday and had no sympathy after supremo Khan apologised to fans on Twitter.</p>

<p>Slamming Khan's decision to post about the fiasco on social media, Carragher told Sky Sports: 'It never works, it always ends up in tears.</p>

<p>Fulham are bottom of the Premier League after conceding 10 goals in three games this season</p>

<p>Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher slammed frail Fulham and club owner Tony Khan</p>

<p>'He's a clown, getting involved with that. Just shut your mouth, get on with it, keep your head down.</p>

<p>'It was a really poor performance. It was that bad, we were actually laughing at some of the defending. Fulham are going down - I've never been more certain about anything in my life. </p>

<p>'I'm more certain of Fulham going down than Liverpool winning the league. What we saw there was actually unbelievable.'</p>

<p>Flummoxed Khan revealed he had missed out on four defensive targets since Fulham were promoted from the Championship in August, while beleaguered boss Scott Parker admitted he was not fully aware of the owner's struggle to enhance his squad.</p>

<p>Khan used Twitter to address supporters in the aftermath of the 3-0 home defeat by Aston Villa</p>

<p>The owner claimed that the club had been hampered in their attempts to boost their defence</p>

<p>Khan criticised the playing staff in a move that left Carragher and Roy Keane deeply perturbed</p>

<p>Carragher fiercely criticised Khan's role in Fulham's big-spending summer two years ago, when they went on to be relegated with a whimper after winning promotion.</p>

<p>He said: 'He was buying all the players, he made a right mess of that. What does Scott Parker think about this? What do those lads who are playing at the back think about that, who have maybe got to play in midweek or at the weekend?</p>

<p>'Just keep your mouth shut. They were a mess last time they came up. What they don't want to be this year is a mess. They're going to go down but almost go down together, be a club, stick together.'</p>

<p>Former Manchester United midfielder Keane added that he could not see any of the positives mentioned by Cottagers manager Scott Parker (above) during his post-match remarks</p>

<p>Carragher singled out full-back Denis Odoi for his part in the Cottagers' third consecutive defeat since their return to the Premier League, while fellow pundit Roy Keane also directed a warning at Khan.</p>

<p>The former Manchester United midfielder said: 'You talk about engaging with supporters but you shouldn't be discussing the club's business or your transfer targets.</p>

<p>'That's nobody's business. When you've been beaten 3-0 at home, take your medicine and look at things over the next few days. Bizarre.' </p>

<p>There have been reminders of Fulham's last Premier League season in their first three games</p>
