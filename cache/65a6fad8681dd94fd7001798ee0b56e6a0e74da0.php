<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce a 'roadmap out of lockdown in Victoria' despite saying Stage Four restrictions won't be lifted on September 13.</p>

<p>The roadmap will be released on Sunday and is being finalised with community groups, businesses and unions as well as extensive modelling by health experts. </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 41 deaths and 73 new coronavirus cases on Monday, bringing the state's toll to 565 and the national total to 652. </p>

<p>Monday's number includes 33 deaths in the weeks leading up to August 27, but were only reported to Victoria Health by aged care facilities on Sunday.</p>

<p>This means eight people died in the 24 hours to Monday. The premier says the roadmap will be put forward after another week of data is recorded.  </p>

<p>'We will announce the roadmap to ease the restrictions we have all been living under. It is too early today to settle that roadmap and to lock that in as it were,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews will announce a 'roadmap out of lockdown in Victoria' on Sunday but said stage four restrictions may not be lifted in two weeks</p>

<p>The figures, confirmed by the Department of Health and Human Services on Monday, bring the state's toll from the virus to 565 and the national total to 652 </p>

<p>Victoria's Police Association on Monday called for state of emergency powers to be extended (pictured: people walking through Southbank on Saturday)</p>

<p>'Another week's data is critically important to make sure that the strategy continues to work and for us to have a better sense of how long it will take to drive these numbers down to very, very low numbers so that they can be contained without the need to put restrictions back on over not just weeks and months.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Nick Coatsworth said it was difficult to see Melbourne coming out of its stage four restrictions on September 13, given the current numbers.</p>

<p>New cases dropped to 94 on Saturday but were back to 114 on Sunday before Monday's drop to 73.</p>

<p>'It's hard to see that happening,' Dr Coatsworth told Nine Network.</p>

<p>'I think the numbers need to be a lot less than they are now.' </p>

<p>Mr Andrews agreed and said he could not rule out what the numbers would be like in two weeks time.</p>

<p>'We can't rule out settings in two weeks' time, it is very difficult to know what those settings will be. They have to be guided by the data, the science and the very best medical advice,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Andrews said the current case numbers are too high for Victoria to open up, and still too high to put forward a definitive plan.</p>

<p>'There will be a plan. It will come soon. But it will be one that we can be confident of, not something that potentially gets a few people being happier,' he said.</p>

<p>The premier said there were a 'number of key principles' of the roadmap which will 'add to the enormous number of meetings and discussions that were held with businesses and unions'.  </p>

<p>Physical distancing and density requirements will be taken into consideration, and the priority of getting people back to work.</p>

<p>The premier has announced the restrictions roadmap will be put forward after another week of data is recorded (Locals exercising by the Polly Woodside)</p>

<p>'We will announce the roadmap to ease the restrictions we have all been living under. It is too early today to settle that roadmap and to lock that in as it were,' Mr Andrews said</p>

<p>The premier also said face coverings will need to be worn at all times and hygiene needs to be adhered to in workplaces. </p>

<p>'Finally, continuing to act quickly if a staff member becomes unwell, and having a policy that can be fairly described as strict when it comes to keeping staff at home if they are unwell, and making sure that they are not at work between when they have a test, because they have the onset of symptoms, and when the test result comes back,' Mr Andrew said.</p>

<p>'They are commonsense principles, but they are very important and they will have to underpin each and every one of the decisions that we will announce, and the pathway that we will share with Victorians on Sunday.'</p>

<p>However the premier said stage two and three restrictions may look 'substantially different' under the roadmap out of COVID-19. </p>

<p>'They will be substantially different framework. This will be a traffic light system and we will move through different phases and there will be some elements that might be similar to the stages … but it will be very different,' he said.</p>

<p>'We have another week's data, and the week's data is very precious.' </p>

<p>There are currently 453 Victorians in hospital and 21 people are receiving intensive care, with 13 of those on a ventilator. </p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews will announce a 'roadmap out of lockdown in Victoria' while stage four restrictions won't be lifted on September 13</p>

<p>There are currently 453 Victorians in hospital and 21 people are receiving intensive care, with 13 of those on a ventilator</p>

<p>The premier has announced a restrictions roadmap that will be put forward on Sunday, after another week of data has been recorded</p>

<p>As of Monday there were 2,620 active cases across the state.  </p>

<p>Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said some of the 41 deaths reported on Monday date back to July.</p>

<p>'There are Commonwealth reporting obligations, state reporting processes, and we need to reconcile those cases, so that whatever the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre is reporting is absolutely consistent,' he said on Monday. </p>

<p>Victoria's Police Association on Monday called for state of emergency powers to be extended. </p>

<p>It comes as negotiations continue between the state government and crossbenchers over what should happen when the current state of emergency provisions expire on September 13. </p>

<p>Melburnians are subject to another fortnight of strict stage four restrictions including an 8pm to 5am curfew and Mr Andrews said the benefits from the first four weeks are starting to show.</p>

<p>Regional Victorians are under slightly less strict stage three restrictions for the same period. </p>

<p>Last week Mr Andrews sparked controversy when he announced the government had plans to extend the powers by 12 months to help deal with coronavirus.  </p>

<p>Victoria has recorded its deadliest day with 41 deaths and 73 new cases of coronavirus reported on Monday (pictured, residents wearing face masks go for a walk in Melbourne on Saturday)</p>

<p>With the opposition immediately saying it would not support the proposal, the government was forced into negotiations with crossbenchers.</p>

<p>There has been talk of a compromise, with the extension reduced to six months, but there is no confirmation ahead of parliament returning on Tuesday.</p>

<p>On Monday the police association, a powerful lobby group, released a statement on the issue.</p>

<p>'With 13 days to run on this current state of emergency, it is essential that parliament moves to maintain the framework that provides police and PSOs (public safety officers) with the capacity to help Victoria safely come out of lockdown,' it said.</p>

<p>'There can be no adequate plan for a return to some normality, if the framework designed to ensure it's done safely and incrementally, is removed.</p>

<p>'This issue is above politics. The safety of our community and our members in this precarious time is too important.' </p>
