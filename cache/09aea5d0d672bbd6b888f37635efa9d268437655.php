<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Anti-terror police are probing a man accused of trying to murder officers and muttering 'Allahu Akhbar' under his breath after the alleged attack. </p>

<p>Frederick Fadi Elrezz, from Lakemba in Sydney's south west, was arrested and charged with attempted murder at about 12.20am on Wednesday.</p>

<p>He is accused of attacking two officers with a knife and biting a third on York Street in the Sydney CBD.</p>

<p>Soon after, Elrezz allegedly told officers: 'I wanted to kill a cop in the name of Allah', The Australian reported.</p>

<p>He also allegedly said 'Allahu Akhbar' during his subsequent interview.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the 32-year-old's history that indicates he supports extremist agendas or that he has been radicalised.</p>

<p>But anti-terror teams will investigate his background to assess any potential links to terror organisations.   </p>

<p>A policeman (pictured), 40, was allegedly slashed in the head and shoulder by a Lakemba man, 32, on York Street in the Sydney CBD at 12:20am on Wednesday </p>

<p>'It is routine in something like this,' a police source told The Daily Telegraph.   </p>

<p>'But there is no affiliation with terror groups or any evidence he is even religious.'</p>

<p>When police collected Elrezz's belongings from the York St hostel where he'd spent the last 10 days, they didn't find anything which linked him to terrorism.</p>

<p>But police allege he may have some ideological beliefs.</p>

<p>Multiple search warrants were executed across several addresses following his arrest, and several items have been seized.</p>

<p>But senior officials have stopped short of calling the incident terror-related, pending inquiries into Elrezz's history. </p>

<p>Detectives are also investigating whether Elrezz had any mental health conditions which may have led to the alleged attack.</p>

<p>Police were called after the 32-year-old allegedly harassed a food delivery rider on George Street, which is one of the busiest streets in the city centre. </p>

<p>Officers then approached the man as he was walking along the nearby York Street, which is when he allegedly pulled out a knife and started attacking them.  </p>

<p>One of the officers was left with blood gushing from his head and shoulder after arriving on the scene.   </p>

<p>The injured officers were also taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where the 40-year-old officer (pictured)underwent treatment for lacerations on the left side of his head and another on his upper arm and shoulder area</p>

<p>A male senior constable, 40, was slashed across his head and shoulder while his male acting sergeant, 39, was slashed on the hand. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a male probationary constable, 20, was bitten on his tricep. </p>

<p>The 32-year-old man was then disarmed and arrested, before being taken to St Vincent's Hospital for assessment. </p>

<p>Pictures from after the attack show blood pouring from the senior constable's head, covering most of his face.  </p>

<p>A bite mark and blood can also be seen on the youngest officer's tricep. </p>

<p>The injured officers were also taken to St Vincent's Hospital, where the 40-year-old officer underwent treatment for lacerations on the left side of his head and another on his upper arm and shoulder.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the 39-year-old was treated for a laceration to his finger and a knee injury and the youngest officer was treated for his bite. </p>

<p>Frederick Fadi Elrezz, from Lakemba in Sydney's south west, was arrested and charged with attempted murder about 12.20am on Wednesday accused of attacking two officers with a knife and biting a third on York Street in the Sydney CBD</p>

<p>Assistant Commissioner Michael Willing said the men were 'lucky to be alive' following the alleged attack.   </p>

<p>'It appears to have happened in a flash with the bodycam vision quite confronting and we allege showing the man pulling a knife on the officers,' he said.</p>

<p>The alleged attacker was taken to Day Street Police Station following his discharge from hospital. </p>

<p>He has now been charged with cause wounding/grievous bodily harm to person with intent to murder, wound person with intent to resist/prevent arrest, assault police officer in execution of duty cause actual bodily harm and resist or hinder police officer in the execution of duty.</p>

<p>The man has been refused bail to appear at Downing Centre Local Court on Wednesday. </p>

<p>The officers' body cam vision and audio is also being reviewed. </p>
