<p>Racy loungewear: Olivia Bowen showed off her at-home look on Tuesday, uploading sizzling Instagrams as she posed in skimpy white pjs</p>

<p>Olivia flaunted her tanned and tattooed figure in the white crop top and matching hot pants.</p>

<p>She added a glam touch of makeup, including a ruby red lip colour as she showed off every angle of her racy look. </p>

<p>'Pj’s or out that is the question? Cutteee,' she teased in the Instagram caption.    </p>

<p>Olivia has been celebrating two years of marriage with husband Alex recently, with the pair dining at London's Scott's last Tuesday and STK the following evening. </p>

<p>Wow: The Love Island star showed off her curves in the racy nightwear, posing in the lavish home she shares with Alex</p>

<p>The lovebirds also pulled out all the stops to celebrate their anniversary with a romantic stay at five-star hotel ME London during the week.</p>

<p>Their relationship has gone the distance after they first got together before reality TV cameras, and they're one of the rare Love Island couples to have stayed together. </p>

<p>The pair tied the knot in a lavish Essex wedding back in September 2018 following a two-year romance. </p>

<p>When asked why she thinks her and Alex's relationship has worked so well, she told MailOnline: 'It’s such a hard one to answer because I was never ready for a relationship when I went in there and we tried to be friends for such a long time.</p>

<p>Out! After musing whether to stay in in her pjs, Olivia decided to glam up to hit London for a dinner and night out with her friends</p>

<p>'We were sort of trying to make it really casual and not really looking at it as a relationship and I think that’s partly the reason why. It happened so naturally in such an unnatural environment, we just clicked.</p>

<p>'I think it is really hard to find. I think as well we trust each other, we have fun together and we also have created a little bubble that we like to live in where we keep ourselves to ourselves.</p>

<p>'I think that’s a really key thing in this industry to remember why you’re with someone and to respect and trust them and that’s all that matters.' </p>

<p>Celebration: She's spent the past several days celebrating her two-year wedding anniversary with her husband Alex Bowen. Pictured together on Love Island back in 2016 </p>
