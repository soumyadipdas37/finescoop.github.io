<p>Lee confirmed his retirement from stand-up comedy during an appearance on The Jonathan Ross Show in 2014. </p>

<p>On the show, he told Jonathan  that the death of his manager, Addison Cresswell, had 'put things in perspective'.    </p>

<p>He said: 'I don't know, I've come to a junction in my life where - please forgive me it sounds very narcissistic - I've done musicals and plays and films and stand up and you sort of get to a point where you go "I don't know what else to do next".'</p>

<p>He added: 'I want to go and see my wife, she deserves my time, I've been working solidly.'</p>

<p>Ross asked how long the planned to carry on in his job, to which he replied: 'I am knackered. This is it. Finished. This is the end. I am not doing anything.' </p>

<p>Catch up: Lee appeared in good spirits on the outing as he chatted to a friend who passed him by while he was out for a run</p>

<p>Casual: The Medallion star also sported a pair of navy trainers and completed his look with a pair of sunglasses </p>

<p>Fancy seeing you here! He was chatting away during the outing</p>

<p>Lee added another reason for his departure was the death of his manager Addison Creswell, who died after suffering a heart attack last year.</p>

<p>'All I have ever done is work and Addison always used to put his arm around me and say, "Don't worry, I will look after you. It is okay",' he said.</p>

<p>'My dad always said to me, "You have got to work" so I constantly worked and did comedy tours. I think I have ignored for far too long my missus, and I want to spend a lot more time with her.'</p>

<p>Chatting away: He fondly greeted the passerby</p>
