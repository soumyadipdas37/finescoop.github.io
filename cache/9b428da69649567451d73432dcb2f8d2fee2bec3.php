<p>Cherrise Massay, 23, who lives in Salford, Manchester, went under the knife in Istanbal, Turkey, after friends recommended a clinic.</p>

<p>The beautician paid £5,500 for a breast uplift, augmentation and a Brazilian butt lift.</p>

<p>However, she woke from the eight-hour surgery to find her bottom had been filled with breast implants.</p>

<p>Cherrise Massay, 23, who lives in Salford, Manchester, is urging women not to travel abroad for cosmetic surgery after having a botched procedure in Istanbul, Turkey. Pictured: Cherrise, before surgery </p>

<p>The mother-of-two was soon required to have emergency surgery and three blood transfusions, which were only the start of her 'living nightmare.'</p>

<p>Cherrise said: 'I researched the clinic and saw amazing results as four friends had been there. Everything seemed legit and I couldn't wait to get rid of my saggy boobs after breast feeding.</p>

<p>'Initially, I wanted a fatty lump removed from my bottom as I had a BBL in February in Miami.</p>

<p>'But after my consultation, I agreed to have implants as it sounded better - however I did not think it would be breast implants!</p>

<p>'I woke up from the surgery and I didn't feel well. I knew something was wrong. I begged the nurses, who couldn't speak English, to help me as I couldn't even lift up my head.</p>

<p>'It took two days of complaining for them to realise - something isn't right.'</p>

<p>The beautician (pictured) had to be rushed to intensive care for three blood transfusions after her body began to reject the implants</p>

<p>Cherrise recalls having six drains attached to her breasts, bum and stomach, with all filling rapidly with blood.</p>

<p>She was rushed to intensive care for three blood transfusions.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old was told her body was rejecting the bum implants and she was put under local anaesthetic whilst they were removed.</p>

<p>Cherrise said: 'I instantly felt better when I woke up from surgery.</p>

<p>'I was shocked when I saw the implants they put in - they were different sizes and for breasts!</p>

<p>'My breasts looks good but swollen which is normal however my one nipple kept on bleeding.</p>

<p>'They kept putting small plaster-like strips over it to mask the bleeding and the fact it was rising.</p>

<p>Cherrise (pictured before) was diagnosed with necrosis, when she visited A&amp;E in the UK where doctors were horrified to see what had been done to her body </p>

<p>'But I was told the bleeding was normal.'</p>

<p>After one week, Cherrise returned back to the U.K. and immediately went to A&amp;E.</p>

<p>She was diagnosed with flesh eating bacterial necrosis, but the bleeding was a good sign because it meant the skin wasn't completely dead.</p>

<p>She said: 'Doctors were horrified to see what they had done to me.</p>

<p>'I had to go every other day to get the bandages changed and it went from bad to worse.</p>

<p>'My nipple was purple in Turkey and I was told it was bruising but after a couple of weeks, it was jet black.</p>

<p>'Two weeks after the surgery, I noticed my nipple was lifting despite being on strong antibiotics to try and stop the infection.</p>

<p>Cherrise (pictured) said within weeks of having surgery her nipple fell off, leaving a 'gaping' hole in her chest </p>

<p>'Four days later on September 21, my nipple completely came off.</p>

<p>'I fell to the floor as I saw it peel off with the bandages. I am completely mortified.'</p>

<p>Cherrise claims to have been left with a 'gaping' hole in her chest which she says has a 'horrific' smell.</p>

<p>Holding back the tears, Cherrise said: 'I feel like i'm in a horror film - i can't even get away with it.</p>

<p>'It stinks like a dead body because it is rotting flesh.</p>

<p>'I can't forget about it because it is burning and my whole breast is in pain.</p>

<p>'I am at risk of contracting sepsis and the clinic in Turkey don't even care - they have blocked me!' </p>

<p>NHS doctors told Cherrise that they suspect an artery was caught when inserting the implant.</p>

<p>Cherrise (pictured) admits she regrets going to Turkey for surgery and hopes sharing her story will stop other women from going abroad for procedures </p>

<p>They are monitoring the infection but may have to take the implant out.</p>

<p>Cherrise said: 'I am happy to take the implant out if necessary.</p>

<p>'I regret going to Turkey, I wish I had just kept my saggy boobs.</p>

<p>'I am going to need a skin graft on my nipple in the future which will leave me with more scars.</p>

<p>'It is too late for me and I have a long road to recover but I hope my story will stop other women from going abroad for surgery.</p>

<p>'The surgeons I visited don't care about you, they just want your money - I have learnt the hard way.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't wish any of this on my worst enemy - it is truly horrendous.</p>

<p>'I wish I had saved more and got the surgery in the UK, I was quoted £8,800.</p>

<p>'I am urging girls to save more and steer clear from Turkey - it doesn't matter if your friend has been or you have done research!'</p>
