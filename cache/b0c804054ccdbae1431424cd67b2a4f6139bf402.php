<p>Three former G4S employees have been charged with defrauding the Ministry of Justice over an electronic tagging scandal.</p>

<p>Richard Morris, the former managing director of G4S Care and Justice Services, and two ex-directors of its electronic monitoring business, Mark Preston and James Jardine, face seven fraud charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO).</p>

<p>It comes two months after the company agreed to pay £44.4million as part of a deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO.</p>

<p>The outsourcer overcharged the Government by millions of pounds when it monitored the movements of offenders.</p>

<p>G4S was found to have logged hours for tracking thousands of 'phantom' offenders, some of whom had died, gone overseas or were back in prison. </p>

<p>The scandal was uncovered in 2013. The SFO said the trio of former divisional directors were accused of making 'false representations' to the Ministry of Justice between 2009 and 2012.</p>

<p>They will appear at Southwark Crown Court on October 6.</p>

<p>Ross Dixon, representing Morris, said Morris 'refutes these allegations' and was 'confident he will be cleared'. G4S said: 'It is not appropriate for us to comment on the individual cases.'</p>
