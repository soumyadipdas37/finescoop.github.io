<p>'Slaven Bilic has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E3,' a governing body statement read.</p>

<p>'It is alleged that the West Bromwich Albion FC manager's language and/or behaviour on the field of play at half-time of the Premier League fixture against Everton amounts to improper conduct.'</p>

<p>The FA statement added that Bilic had until Thursday to respond.</p>

<p>Bilic was unhappy with Dean's decision to send off Kieran Gibbs just before the break</p>

<p>Bilic came onto the pitch following the first-half dismissal of Kieran Gibbs for pushing Everton's James Rodriguez in the face.</p>

<p>Bilic said of the incident that led to his own red card: 'As a manager I should be in a situation to ask the referee what's going on.</p>

<p>'I didn't swear. I asked him in a frustrated way but I didn't go over the line but he just ignored me and gave me red. I told him 'if you want to kill us, kill us'. That's all.'</p>

<p>The 52-year-old was made to watch from the stands as West Brom lost 5-2 to Everton</p>

<p>He was fined £2,000 in August 2019 after being sent to the stands during a Championship match against Derby.</p>

<p>In February 2017 he was fined £8,000 after admitting an FA misconduct charge during his time at West Ham. He was sent off for protesting about a goal scored by West Brom, throwing a television mic to the ground in frustration.</p>
