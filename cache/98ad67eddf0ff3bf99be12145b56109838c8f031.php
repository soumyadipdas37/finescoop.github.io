<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the toe-curling moment a giant spider sits and consumes a bird whole. </p>

<p>In a video posted on Reddit a week ago, the giant, hairy spider is perched on a wooden beam holding an entire bird in its legs.</p>

<p>The spider, believed to be a pink toe tarantula, dwarfs the house wren which hangs limply as it's hunter nibbles away on it.</p>

<p>A massive spider, believed to be a pink toe tarantula, hangs from a wooden beam slowly devouring an entire house wren</p>

<p>The Reddit user who posted the video originally had initially believed the spider to have been a Goliath bird eater - the largest spider in the world.</p>

<p>However, Jason Dunlop, from the Museum of Natural History at the Leibniz Institute for Evolution and Biodiversity Research in Germany believes the spider to be a pink toe tarantula.</p>

<p>Speaking to Newsweek he said: 'Or at least something closely related.</p>

<p>Dunlop also explained that generally tarantulas don't eat birds, but there are always exceptions.</p>

<p>He said: 'I suspect the tarantula would have chewed up what it can.</p>

<p>The pink toe tarantula normally live in trees and can grow to have a leg span of five inches</p>

<p>'It basically regurgitates digestive juices on to the prey and then sucks the liquified remains back in.</p>

<p>'Whatever was left—bones, feathers—would simply be discarded.'</p>

<p>The pink toe tarantula is normally found throughout Brazil and the rest of the Amazon basin.</p>

<p>Living in trees, this type of tarantula can grow to have a leg span of up to five inches and have a distinctive pink colouring on the end of their legs.</p>

<p>The hairs on their legs can sometimes be fired from its body as a form of defence. </p>
