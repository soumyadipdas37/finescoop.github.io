<p>'I thought I'd have John for a very, very long time, it wasn't to be,' Kerri-Anne said, looking downcast. </p>

<p>'Coming to work, literally saved me. You people, our audience, as well as you guys, literally saved me,' Kerri-Anne said. </p>

<p>She also reflected on how the hosts left work early to support her at his funeral in March last year, saying it was one of the most 'beautiful moments.'  </p>

<p>'If I was the executive producer you wouldn't have gone. Channel 10 made that decision... I was so, so grateful, for all the misdemeanors, you have saved my sanity, so thank you,' she said. </p>

<p>Kerri-Anne added also hit back at critics during her farewell speech, after never being afraid to share her own opinions on the show.  </p>

<p>'If you have an opinion that's not fashionable and someone doesn't agree with, it doesn't mean you can't have it,' she defiantly said. </p>

<p>She added: 'I will miss you, you guys have been my family.'</p>

<p>Sarah Harris, who will be co-hosting the revamped show with Tristan MacManus, praised Kerri-Anne calling her 'strong, wildly funny and a beautiful woman.' </p>

<p>'You're so strong, losing beautiful John on this show and all these other things going on and you just soldiered on like the absolute professional you are,' Sarah said. </p>

<p>'You are a good bird, you know all the crew's names, you've worked with them in the past... you've got this great TV brain as well... it was so fun sitting next to you and I will always count you as a friend.' </p>

<p>Kerri-Anne also shared a picture of herself on Instagram with her co-stars and holding a bunch of flowers, writing: 'Thank you to my extraordinary fans, Studio 10 family and Channel 10. It's been fabulous.' </p>

<p>The bubbly star was made redundant by Channel 10 last month. Tim Bailey and Natarsha were also made redundant, while Joe Hildebrand announced on Thursday that he's leaving the show.   </p>

<p>Kerri-Anne fought back tears as she bid farewell to viewers on August 12, less than 24 hours after being sacked from the network as a cost-cutting measure.</p>

<p>Kerri-Anne, who was axed from Channel 10 along with 25 other staff members, appeared to shake with emotion while addressing her departure.</p>

<p>She acknowledged that the coronavirus pandemic had made it necessary to tighten the budget, and thanked her friends and colleagues for their support.</p>

<p>'I just know I'm back on the 'lazy Susan' of television. Yeah, it's very, very tough for a lot of people,' she began. </p>

<p>'But I've always worked on a personal level, the Charles Darwin theory that says to survive you don't need to be the most intelligent, you don't have to be the strongest, but you have to be, to survive, the most adaptable,' she added.</p>

<p>Kerri-Anne, who joined Studio 10 as a part-time panelist in September 2018, went on to say just how much she treasures the friendships she's made along the way.</p>

<p>'I've had a ball! And the reason why I've got this outfit today is because, if you're being run out of town, get in front of the parade or get in front of the crowd and make it look like a parade!' she added with a salute. </p>

<p>'It's the nature of television!' Last week, she told The Sydney Morning Herald how she really feels about being sacked and even hinted that she'll return to television soon</p>

<p>'Mate, it is what it is, it's the nature of television. I've seen and been through it all before,' she told the publication. </p>

<p>The morning television veteran then added tellingly: 'and I'll be around to see it happen all again.' </p>

<p>Another star who was a casualty of Channel 10's mass job cuts was Mike Larkan. </p>

<p>Having spent 25 years at the network, Mike admitted he was shocked to learn he was getting boned last month.</p>

<p>'I was caught off guard. I'll be honest... I was totally surprised when I got the phone call. I just had no idea', he told The Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>'You don't want to hear the news you are no longer in their plan going forward. But, well, I've taken that in my stride,' he added.</p>

<p>'I've had a good 25 years and I've been lucky to have survived that long. There have been retrenches and I've survived those, but not quite this time.'  </p>

<p>Respected newsreader Natarsha Belling was sacked by Channel 10 last month after more than two decades at the network.  </p>

<p>Making a dignified exit, Natarsha later shared a classy farewell to viewers and her former colleagues via Instagram.</p>

<p>The 45-year-old showed no bitterness towards Channel 10, and instead thanked her bosses for supporting her career since her early twenties.</p>

<p>'It's been an absolute pleasure being part of the Network 10 family for more than 22 years and I want to thank the network for all the wonderful opportunities I've enjoyed over the past two decades,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'During that time, I've worked with some of the very best in the TV business who have inspired me with their skill, passion and dedication,' she continued.</p>

<p>Natarsha acknowledged that 2020 has been a 'challenging year for many' and has 'in many way reminded us about what truly matters in life'.</p>

<p>'I'm sad to leave, but excited about the new chapter ahead. I can't wait to share with you what's coming up!' she concluded. </p>

<p>Legendary weatherman Tim Bailey was also sacked as part of Channel 10's brutal budget cuts last month, after 30 years at the network.</p>

<p>Axed: Legendary weatherman Tim Bailey (pictured) was also sacked as part of Channel 10's brutal budget cuts last month, after 30 years at the network</p>

<p>Tim, 57, enjoyed an illustrious career as a roving reporter and weather guru. </p>

<p>Tim began working for Channel 10 in 1980 after scoring a job as a reporter on Good Morning Australia with Mike Gibson and Kerri-Anne Kennerley.</p>

<p>The multi-talented journalist began doing the weather in 1996, and has remained in that role ever since.</p>

<p>Prior to being axed, Tim presented the weather on location around New South Wales towns for Ten News at Five, and was also a fill-in news reporter.  </p>

<p>Joe Hildebrand announced he was leaving the network live on Studio 10 on Thursday.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old journalist broke down in tears as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to quit after seven years. </p>

<p>A devastated Joe began: 'I do have some news. I want to say it here first before you saw it or heard it anywhere else.</p>

<p>'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done.</p>

<p>'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role. We talked about it openly and warmly about what that might look like.' </p>

<p>Speaking of his bosses' reaction when he told them he was leaving Studio 10, Joe said: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them!</p>

<p>'I just thought, it's probably just better to draw a line under this amazing little story that I've been lucky enough to be a part of.</p>

<p>'I want to give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around.' </p>
