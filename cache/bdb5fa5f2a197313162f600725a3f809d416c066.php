<p>The group of around ten, who were crammed on a rubber dinghy, were spotted leaping out and running across the beach towards scattered trees as their vessel neared the shore at Kingsdown beach, near Dover, on Monday morning.</p>

<p>The scenes come as Home Secretary Priti Patel faces increasing pressure to act following a sharp upsurge in Channel migrant numbers to more than 6,000 so far this year. </p>

<p>Border Force and French patrols have been active in the Dover Strait since the early hours of the morning.</p>

<p>Kent Police and immigration enforcement officers were also seen in the area. </p>

<p>The group of migrants were spotted running out of the small boat at Kingsdown beach in Kent on Monday morning</p>

<p>The group of suspected migrants were cramped inside the grey dinghy as they made their way to the shore </p>

<p>After landing on the beach this morning, the group ran across the beach towards scattered trees</p>

<p>The latest crossings come after hundreds of people managed to reach the UK on Friday, with thousands making the hazardous journey since the start of 2020.</p>

<p>Weather conditions in the Channel on Monday were calm, with low winds making the sea crossing possible.</p>

<p>The group of suspected migrants, who appeared to all be men, arrived squeezed on board a grey dinghy with a black outboard motor on the back.</p>

<p>Many wore hooded jumpers and one was seen carrying a backpack as they headed off from the shoreline at speed.</p>

<p>Later, the dinghy was seen being towed back out to sea where it was taken on board Border Force cutter Seeker, which arrived in the area soon after the landings.</p>

<p>In Kingsdown village centre, Kent Police and coastguard officials were seen talking to members of the public following the landing.</p>

<p>Six miles down the coast, more migrants were brought into the port of Dover.</p>

<p>People wearing blankets and lifejackets were seen aboard Border Force patrol boat Hunter before being escorted up a gangway.</p>

<p>Once ashore they will be processed and assessed for symptoms of coronavirus, in line with protocol. </p>

<p>The scenes comes after data showed that more than 6,000 migrants have successfully crossed to the UK in small boats this year. </p>

<p>It also comes just a month after Home Secretary Priti Patel warned France that the UK would not spend millions of pounds for anti-migration patrols unless it agreed to take back more refugees. </p>

<p>The group, who appeared to all be men, arrived squeezed on board a grey dinghy with a black outboard motor on the back</p>

<p>The group waited until they arrived to the shoreline before running away from the scene </p>

<p>During a zoom call in August, Ms Patel said France's demand for £30million to fund Channel patrols and surveillance would be dependent on it taking in more of those seeking to get to the UK.</p>

<p>She added that the system was being 'exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers' who were trying to stop the Government from removing people.   </p>

<p>Addressing the rising number of migrants crossing the Channel Ms Patel's newly appointed Clandestine Channel Threat Commander, Dan O'Mahoney, said: 'These crossings are dangerous and unnecessary and I am determined to stop them.</p>

<p>'The minister and I met with French officials in Paris on Tuesday for discussions on how to advance joint working on making the small boats route for illegal migration unviable.</p>

<p>'We will continue to go after the heinous criminals and organised crime networks putting people's lives at risk.'</p>
