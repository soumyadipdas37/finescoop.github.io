<p>Additionally, the mother-of-three asked for prayers because 'a sista can’t fly with one wing.' </p>

<p>'I was not suppressing my sexuality my whole life,' said the TV star. 'I love who I love. At one point in my life, I married twice and I love those people. And today I love this person. </p>

<p>'I've done everything I wanted to do on my own terms and my own way. So my choice now in a partner has nothing to do with who I've always been. It's a matter of who I am in this moment.'</p>

<p>Nash also shared she became close friends with Jessica in 2015.</p>

<p>But then in October 2019, Niecy told the outlet, something changed.  </p>

<p>'I loved her before I was in love with her because she is such a special human being,' said Nash.  </p>
