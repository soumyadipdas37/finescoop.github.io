<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hilary Duff is trying to make her friends and 15.5 million Instagram followers believers in a staple delicacy that she grew up on in Texas.</p>

<p>And from the sounds of the four basic ingredients that are mixed together, there's little doubt that there will be plenty of naysayers who might not even give it a try.</p>

<p>'Guys this is called Church Salad. I grew up on it. A lot of people think it sounds absolutely disgusting because it dooooooes!' the Lizzie McGuire star, 32, confessed in an Insta-Story video she shot in the kitchen of her Los Angeles home.</p>

<p>'It's a canned pear with a scoop of mayonnaise in the center with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top and a half of maraschino cherry.'</p>

<p>Lobbying: Hilary Duff took to Instagram to urge her followers and fans to try one of her childhood delicacy snacks: Church Salad</p>

<p>Not for everyone: The actress confessed that a lot of people think Church Salad 'sounds absolutely disgusting'</p>

<p>'Sounds suspect,' Hilary's neighbor Gina chimed in about the unusual pairing that makes up Church Salad as the actress continued to encourage people to have an open mind and give it a taste.</p>

<p>'And it's delightful,' she said, 'I'm making my neighbor Gina try it. Let's see.'</p>

<p>It's at this point that Hilary suggested Gina try a small one as she surveyed the five pieces placed on a plate as they sat at a table.</p>

<p>Her pitch: Hilary first laid out the ingredients of Church Salad: 'It's a canned pear with a scoop of mayonnaise in the center with cheddar cheese sprinkled on top and a half of maraschino cherry,' she explained with a big beaming smile on her face</p>

<p>Apprehensive: The Texas native's neighbor was 'suspect' about trying the special snack</p>

<p>After acknowledging that it's her gal pal's birthday, the Material Girls star then suggested she had to eat it in one bite, for which she called: 'one time it.'</p>

<p>According to Hilary, who was born in Houston and raised with older sister Hailey in Houston and San Antonio, it's necessary to eat the whole piece in one gulp in order to get all the flavors at the same time. </p>

<p>'You can do it,' the actress encouraged Gina as she picked up one of the snacks and gulped it down in one bite</p>

<p>'It's a big bite,' Hilary said before adding, 'How are you feeling?'</p>

<p>Method to her madness: The Lizzie McGuire star, 32, explained that its essential to eat the piece all at once in order to get all the flavors at the same time</p>

<p>Anticipation: 'How are you feeling?' Hilary asked after her friend finally got the courage to take a big bite of Church Salad</p>

<p>'First take: It's actually not bad,' Gina initially said of the Church Salad</p>

<p>'It's actually not bad,' Gina said looking into the camera while still trying to swallow all of the Church Salad.</p>

<p>As the taste test was going down, another friend on the other side of the kitchen could be heard yelling out, 'I hate it.'</p>

<p>'I don't know if it's something I would look forward too,' Gina admitted, for which Hilary shot back, 'Are you serious? It's because I didn't have the sharp cheddar.'</p>

<p>Gina was in agreement that the cheese may have been the deal killer and that she would 'get it' if it was sprinkled with sharp cheddar cheese.</p>

<p>'I'm going to go with, I get it,' the neighbor said in her synopsis of the taste test.</p>

<p>Turning her attention back to her fans and followers, Hilary then looked straight into the camera and urged everyone to 'just try it.' </p>

<p>Further analysis: 'I don't know if it's something I would look forward too... but I get it,' Gina admitted, for which Hilary shot back, 'Are you serious? It's because I didn't have the sharp cheddar.'</p>

<p>'Puzzled: Are you serious?' Hilary responded to her friend's critique and then aded the disclaimer: 'It's because I didn't have the sharp cheddar'</p>
