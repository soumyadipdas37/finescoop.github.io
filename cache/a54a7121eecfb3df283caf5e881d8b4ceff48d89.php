<p>Speaking to presenter Julie Etchingham on the ITV News podcast Coronavirus: What You Need To Know, he said: 'I don't remember a story which has so internationally involved us all.</p>

<p>'We are connected much more than we ever thought. We're anxious to hear what's going on all over the world.'</p>

<p>He added: 'It is very, very strange to go through a week knowing that you have so few things which are absolutely planned. It's a bit difficult having all the time on your hands.</p>

<p>'In my personal case, the lack of social contact and having to stay in a lot is at times fairly depressing, really. You just have to try and find ways of dealing with it.</p>

<p>'I must confess I'm not too sure I've done terribly well for finding those ways!' </p>
