<p>The Bell Tower Times shared the note on its Facebook page, admiring the 'impressive levels of neighbourhood pettiness.'</p>

<p>It's understood the note was sent by a frustrated homeowner in Wembley Downs after a string of loud parties by a younger neighbour.</p>

<p>One Facebook user jokingly stated 'no sleep makes boomer something something' while another admired 'the level of trolling some people have'</p>

<p>Having every reason to feel aggrieved, the typed note also states he also 'won't apologise for calling the police with a noise complaint' or that he 'doesn't care that his neighbour is sleep deprived.'</p>

<p>He concludes his brilliant rant by encouraging him 'to email Dad to let him know how it felt to be kept awake to all hours.' </p>
