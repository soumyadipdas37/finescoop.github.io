<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disgraced former Tory MP has been given a pass which allows him free access to Parliament despite a ban on them being handed to jailed ex-politicians.</p>

<p>The former Thanet South MP, 78, was given the security permit by former speaker John Bercow before he left the post last year.</p>

<p>This was despite a prohibition on handing them out to politicians who have served prison sentences of longer than a year.</p>

<p>Mr Aitken was jailed for 18 months in 1999 after being convicted of perjury after accusing he Guardian newspaper of libel. </p>

<p>But he was ordained as a Church of England deacon two years ago and works as a prison chaplain.</p>

<p>A Commons spokeswoman told the Guardian that the usual ban on handing passes to jailbird former MPs had been over-ruled by Mr Bercow.</p>

<p>'Regarding Mr Aitken, the then Speaker took a view that as his conviction was spent, Mr Aitken should be given a former member's pass,' she told the paper.</p>

<p>Mr Aitken was jailed for 18 months in 1999 after being convicted of perjury after accusing he Guardian newspaper of libel (right). But he was ordained as a Church of England two years ago, and works as a prison chaplain (left)</p>

<p>A Commons spokeswoman told the Guardian that the usual ban on handing passes to jailbird former MPs had been over-ruled by Mr Bercow.</p>

<p>Mr Aiken was an MP in Kent, for more than two decades until stepping down at the May 1997 general election.</p>

<p>He was jailed in 1999 for lying under oath in the libel case against The Guardian.</p>

<p>He sued the newspaper after it said he allowed aides of the Saudi royal family to pay his £1,000 hotel bill at the Paris Ritz in September 1993.</p>

<p>He had famously vowed to 'cut out the cancer of bent and twisted journalism in our country with the simple sword of truth and the trusty shield of fair play.'</p>

<p>But he admitted committing perjury after the paper produced evidence that showed he was lying in his evidence.</p>

<p>The ex-Tory MP was ordained at St Paul's Cathedral in 2018 and followed it with a celebration at the Old Bailey.</p>

<p>He joked at the time that his first return to the famous London court building since being jailed there 19 years ago would be a happier occasion.</p>
