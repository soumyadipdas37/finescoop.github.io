<p>Speaking on the Spencer &amp; Vogue podcast, the former Made In Chelsea star, 32, confessed that he reached out to the superstar singer on social media, much to the horror of his wife.  </p>

<p>Vogue, 34, mused: 'Lewis Capaldi, who is very funny on Instagram, very funny, how could you even think he was going to respond to you?' adding that the thought was 'mortifying'. </p>

<p>As she mocked Spencer for being 'upset' that Lewis didn't respond, Spencer scoffed: 'I couldn’t care less!'</p>

<p>'"Hey Lewis I know you haven’t got much on, would you mind, popping down to London to sing at my wedding party!"'</p>
