<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Charles Barkley and Sahquille O'Neal have been attacked on Twitter for defending the police after giving their views on the Breonna Taylor case. </p>

<p>Presenting the TNT pregame show ahead the Los Angeles Lakers vs Denver Nuggets, Barkley said Taylor's death couldn't be compared to the killing of George Floyd because Taylor's boyfriend opened fire on police who then shot back.</p>

<p>O'Neal agreed, saying that - while the system may need to change - the officers involved were simply 'doing their job' on a warrant signed by a judge.</p>

<p>That stance saw the pair immediately come under fire on social media for 'defending the police', as one person branded them: 'Skinfolk, not kinfolk.' </p>

<p>God bless Barkley. He also is the only NBA commentator willing to point out that Brianna Taylor’s boyfriend fired first and hit a cop before they returned fire at him. The lack of basic factual understanding in this case is staggering. pic.twitter.com/2DFIs1XjNn</p>

<p> 'Charles and Shaq both throwing black women under the bus,' one account with the user name Justice for Breonna Taylor wrote'.</p>

<p>'SHAME, I used to be a fan.' </p>

<p>Herb Jones, a former Democrat candidate for the Virginia Senate, added: 'Lost much respect for Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal today regarding their comments regarding the murder of Breonna Taylor...</p>

<p>'So it's OK for some people to protect themselves but not OK for others?'</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of the game, Barkley said: 'I don't think this one was like George Floyd or Ahmaud Arbery and things like that. </p>

<p>'I feel sad that this young lady lost her life. I think the no-knock warrant is something we need to get rid of across the board. </p>

<p>'But we do have to take into account that her boyfriend shot at the cops and shot a cop.' </p>

<p>Shaquille echoed his comments, responding: 'You have to get a warrant signed and some states do allow no-knock warrants. Everyone was asking for murder charges. </p>

<p>'When you talk about murder, you have to show intent. A homicide occurred and we're sorry a homicide occurred. </p>

<p>'When you have a warrant signed by the judge, you are doing your job, and I would imagine that you would fire back.'</p>
