<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A self-described 'incel' has been arrested after the FBI said he sent a flurry of online rape and death threats to a Long Island couple using Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. </p>

<p>David Kaufman, of Westchester County, is charged with stalking and sending threatening interstate communications, according to a federal indictment unsealed on Tuesday in New York.</p>

<p>According to the indictment, Kaufman, who also goes by the online aliases 'David Khalifa,' 'John Morray,' and 'Big Man,' is an 'incel', or involuntary celibate, a sick subculture of men who blame women for refusing to have sex with them, and believe in responding with rape and violence.</p>

<p>The case was investigated by a member of the FBI's New York-based Joint Terrorism Task Force, suggesting that the elite anti-terror squad is turning more of its attention to the online subculture of incels.</p>

<p>Kaufman's federal defender did not immediately respond to a request for comment from DailyMail.com on Thursday. The charges were first reported by the Daily Beast.</p>

<p>According to the indictment, Kaufman met the two primary victims, a male and female couple, while all three were college students on Long Island in September 2012.</p>

<p>The FBI says that Kaufman perpetuated a campaign of online harassment and intimidation against the couple from October 2019 until last month -- persisting even after he was arrested on state charges.</p>

<p>In October, Kaufman began his vicious harassment by commenting on a Facebook post made by the female victim, disparaging her boyfriend, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>'It goes to show that Chads like [male victim] can literally say ANYTHING and have everyone love them no matter what. While incels are F*<strong>ED and have no one give a s</strong>t about them no matter how good their confidence or personality is,' Kaufman allegedly wrote.</p>

<p>'Chad' is the incel slang term for stereotypical 'alpha males' who have romantic success with women. Their female counterparts are known disparagingly as 'Stacy'.  </p>

<p>Kaufman continued, according to the indictment: 'And yes you don't 'Love [male victim] You're helplessly sexually attracted to his Chad face. And you can't bring yourself to admit that.'</p>

<p>After the woman blocked him on Facebook, Kaufman allegedly messaged her on YouTube, saying she had 'a weak boyfriend' and that if he was an incel 'he would have already killed himself' </p>

<p>Kaufman allegedly had this online exchange with a female friend of the woman he targeted</p>

<p>The FBI says that Kaufman the escalated the campaign of online harassment, including by messaging the woman's boyfriend and other friends, and by creating Twitter accounts impersonating her and using them to send crass and profane messages.</p>

<p>On Twitter, Kaufman allegedly used one account to send a message to the woman, saying 'Hey wanna hear a joke? What's worse than 10 Stacy's nailed to one tree? One Stacy nailed to ten trees [laughing crying face emoji]'. </p>

<p>In a text message to the boyfriend on June 29, Kaufman sent a graphic crime scene photo of a woman who was killed by Elliot Rodger in 2014, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>Rodger, who killed six people in California on a stabbing and shooting spree after penning a manifesto expressing hatred of women, is revered among incels, who refer to him as the 'supreme gentleman' in reference to a line from his manifesto.  </p>

<p>'This is what happened when a woman said 'no' to Eilliot Rodger...hopefully [female victim] never said no to someone just like Elliot Rodger,' Kaufman wrote in reference to the graphic murder photo, according to the indictment.</p>

<p>One Twitter account created by Kaufman used the screen name '[boyfriend] beats [female victim]' according to the FBI.</p>

<p>Using that account, the indictment says Kaufman posted on July 11: : 'Women have done nothing but spit in my face. Soon I'll be getting a gun.'</p>

<p>Kaufman is also accused of sending various harassing messages to friends of the couple, including one to a woman stating 'Can I pinch your nose while having u s<strong>k on my c</strong>k so u can't breathe?' </p>

<p>According to the indictment, Kaufman persisted in his campaign of harassment even after being charged in Cortlandt with three misdemeanors: two counts of aggravated harassment in the second degree, and one count of third-degree identity theft.</p>

<p>Kaufman allegedly told federal investigators that he was an incel and identified with Rodgers' manifesto, and admitted to creating impersonating accounts and sending harassing messages. </p>

<p>Kaufman was arrested on the federal charges on Friday and made an initial court appearance the same day. </p>

<p>He is being held without bail and is next due to appear in court on September 30.</p>
