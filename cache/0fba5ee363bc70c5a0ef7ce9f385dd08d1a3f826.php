<p>He told LCFC.com: 'I can't wait to go to Leicester and start training. I've always wanted to play in England and this is a great opportunity to play in the Premier League.</p>

<p>'I will try to help my team-mates on the pitch and off the pitch and I believe that I can improve my performance every day. I think I am fast and can create lots of chances for my colleagues.</p>

<p>'I feel very good because my best friend plays for Leicester City. I am very happy to be able to play with Çağlar [Söyüncü] and I always watched Leicester's games because of him.' </p>

<p>Cengiz admitted that 'best friend' Caglar Soyuncu was a big factor in his move to England</p>

<p>Under has become Leicester's second signing of the transfer window following the arrival of Belgium full-back Timothy Castagne from Atalanta for £22m, as a replacement for £50m Chelsea signing Ben Chilwell. </p>

<p>Castagne made an impressive debut for his new club, scoring in the 3-0 win at West Brom last Sunday.</p>
