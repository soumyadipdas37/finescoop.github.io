<p>Kyle Walker fears his England career could be over after he was sent off against Iceland</p>

<p>The Manchester City defender saw his second yellow after aÂ reckless sliding tackle</p>

<p>'The sad thing about being a footballer, it does come to the end some time and I am probably near the end of my international career,' said an emotional Walker after the game.</p>

<p>'To get sent off for your country is never a nice moment, especially when you're on the caps that I am and being out of the team for so long. I should know I am on a yellow card and to make a rash challenge like that, it's not acceptable.</p>

<p>'I am still very energetic, still feel like I've got a lot in the legs and hopefully I will be back. I'm desperate to play.'</p>

<p>Walker admitted: 'I am probably near the end of my international career' after the match</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his City team-mate Phil Foden said he is determined to make the England shirt his own after making his debut in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>After the 20-year-old was handed a start by manager Gareth Southgate, he said: 'It feels amazing. It's a dream come true. Just to make my debut is a big moment for me and my family.</p>

<p>'I want to keep playing for my country, not just a one-off. Hopefully I can keep the shirt.'</p>
