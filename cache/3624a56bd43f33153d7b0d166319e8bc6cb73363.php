<p>Neighbours claim Ms Vlajkov attracts more than 600 birds to her home every day and refuses to stop her habit despite their repeated pleas. </p>

<p>City of Salisbury Council received a number of complaints about Ms Vlajkov's bird feeding, who tried on three occasions to speak with her but to no avail.</p>

<p>The council issued Ms Vlajkov with a legal warning this week, which read if she doesn't stop feeding the pigeons should would be fined $30,000.</p>

<p>Ms Vlajkov said she will not pay any fine she is given.</p>

<p>'I don't pay nothing,' she said. 'Chasing the old lady for pigeon feeding, that's awful.'</p>

<p>Neighbours say Ms Vlajkov attracts 600 pigeons a day, leaving their homes covered in poo</p>

<p>Ms Vlajkov said she is willing to take the matter to court to fight for her right to feed the birds.</p>

<p>'But I'm not scared about that. I know I didn't do nothing against nobody,' she said.</p>
