<p>Despite her contented appearance here, Demi has recently lamented being marked after being stung by a jellyfish. </p>

<p>Turning to her Twitter followers, she penned that she was disappointed she couldn't enjoy a peaceful swim without jellyfish surrounding her. </p>

<p>Demi added: 'It’s Jelly season over here in ibiza and it’s just impossible to swim without getting stung'.</p>

<p>Despite the prospect of two weeks behind closed doors upon her return to the UK - the result of tightening travel restrictions in the fight against COVID-19 - Demi still seems to be smiling.</p>

<p>Spain had been among of a number of 'air-bridge' countries considered to be safe for quarantine-free travel, promoting many stars to book getaways, but a spike in coronavirus cases across the country has prompted a change in policy.</p>

<p>Before her trip to Ibiza, the Birmingham native had been isolating in her London flat after the novel coronavirus pandemic scuppered her travel plans for March - much to her displeasure.</p>

<p>Taking to social media at the time, the brunette lamented: 'All I have with me is crochet stuff and bikinis. I'm sick of wearing all the other stuff that I bought that is loungey.'</p>

<p>Ouch! Despite her contented appearance , Demi has recently been lamenting how it is currently jelly fish season in Ibiza</p>
