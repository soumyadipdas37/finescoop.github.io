<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman has filmed herself washing her boyfriend's stained pillows for the first time in 10 years — and social media users are horrified by the state of them. </p>

<p>In the viral video, the TikToker claimed her boyfriend refuses to replace his decade-old pillows, noting that he never washed them once in all of the time he has had them.</p>

<p>She documented the entire cleaning process, washing three of the dingy pillows — which were yellowed and filthy — and the result is astounding.</p>

<p>Filthy: A TikTok user filmed a video of herself cleaning her boyfriend's pillows for the first time in 10 years, explaining that he refuses to replace them </p>

<p>While her boyfriend was at work, she placed them in the bathtub and threw in a couple of dishwasher tablets.</p>

<p>She then poured some Borax powder into the tub before adding bleach into the mixture.</p>

<p>The TikToker proceeded to use a mop to wring out the dirt from the pillows, and then tossed them into the washing machine.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the pillows came out completely white — a stark contrast to their dark yellow and brown shade before the wash. </p>

<p>Getting started: She placed them in the bathtub and threw in a couple of dishwasher tablets</p>

<p>Next up: The TikToker also added Borax power and bleach to the water </p>

<p>The video has since gone viral on TikTok, gaining over 1.7 million views and leaving users in shock at the state of the pillows before they were washed. </p>

<p>'With that alone, I would replace the boyfriend. Hygiene is everything,' one person wrote, while another added: '10 years of sweat, dead skin, dirt, oil and bacteria' </p>

<p>Someone else commented: 'They are meant to be replaced every two years... they come with expiry dates on them...'</p>

<p>Social media users certainly had reason to be appalled, considering pillows are supposed to be replaced every one or two years and washed at least four times a year.   </p>

<p>Getting them clean: She proceeded to use a mop to wring out the dirt from the pillows</p>

<p>Amazing: After throwing the soaked pillows in the wash, they came out perfectly white</p>

<p>An expert from Christy England, which supplies to Wimbledon and the royal family, told FEMAIL in April that 'pillows should be washed every three months because, similar to bedding, they contain a build-up of sweat and dead skin.' </p>

<p>And while most people think that a whirl in the washing machine will thoroughly clean their clothes and linens — but it turns out that some fabrics may be retaining a horrifying buildup of dirt.</p>

<p>'Stripping' laundry is the special trick that gets everything super clean, removing the grime that washing machines won't.</p>

<p>The technique involves soaking laundry in a tub of hot water, baking soda, Borax, and detergent, similar to what the TikToker did to her boyfriend's pillows. </p>

<p>Like new: The Tiktoker joked that she 'can sleep better knowing those nasty pillows are clean'</p>

<p>Say what? Social media users were horrified by the filthy brown pillows </p>

<p>People have been stripping their laundry for ages, but the process is reaching a new generation after going viral on TikTok in recent months. </p>

<p>Nurse Lauren Elms shared several walk-throughs on the app, first stripping her workout clothes on April 22 and then doing her towels on April 24.</p>

<p>The video of her stripping her towels was viewed more than six million times.</p>

<p>In the clip, she filled a tub with hot water and added a quarter cup of baking soda, a quarter cup of Borax, and a generous scoop of powder detergent and places her laundry in the tub.  </p>

<p>Lauren advised stirring the clothes every couple of hours, but she showed that just ten minutes in, the water was already dirty. After seven hours, the water was a filthy, dark brown color.</p>

<p>She pointed out that her clothes and towels were actually 'clean' when they went in the tub, so this was all buildup. She told viewers to finish up by re-washing their laundry as they normally would in a machine. </p>

<p>Get stripping! Most people think that the washing machine will thoroughly clean their clothes and linens — but it turns out that some fabrics may be retaining a horrifying buildup of dirt</p>

<p>Mix it up: 'Stripping' laundry involves soaking laundry in a tub of hot water, baking soda, Borax, and detergent</p>

<p>Yuck! After soaking the laundry in the solution, it may leave behind water that looks like this</p>

<p>She also showed that the bottom of her drained tub was dirtied with a surprising residue from the soak.</p>

<p>Lauren's video set off a trend, and several others have mimicked her with their own clips. Some just shared shocked and horrified reactions, while others replicated the experiment with their own clothes.</p>

<p>According to The Spruce, 'body soil and bacteria' can get stuck in fabrics, especially terry cloth towels.</p>

<p>That's why some older towels and gym clothes may smell clean immediately after coming out of the wash, but will start to smell as soon as they get damp.</p>

<p>When laundry is thrown in the wash, the soap is doing a lot of the work to clean it — but it's still circulating in dirty water, which gets reabsorbed into the fabric.</p>

<p>Stripping can get rid of some of the dirt and bacteria, while smells can be killed by adding vinegar to a wash.</p>
