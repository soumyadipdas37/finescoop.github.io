<p>The Notebook actress quietly gave birth to her now two-year-old son - whose name has never been publicly released - in April 2018.  </p>

<p>During her first pregnancy she avoided the public eye, even skipping the premiere of her film Game Night. </p>

<p>Speaking to the Sunday Times in 2018, she said 'I want to keep his life private, even if mine isn't.'</p>

<p>Six months after giving birth to her son, McAdams posed for Girls Girls Girls Magazine where she was seen dolled up while using a breast pump in a stylized shoot for Versace.   </p>

<p>The couple who have been in LA also split time between their country home outside Toronto where she lives out her dream of being a farmer, and gives her son a chance to interact with animals. </p>

<p>In a virtual interview for Heroes of Health back in April, she shared that spending time with her son in quarantine was a blessing though at times challenging.</p>
