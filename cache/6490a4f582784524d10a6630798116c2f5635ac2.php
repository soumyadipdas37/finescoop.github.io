<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A volunteer helping to search for a Covid-19 vaccine says he is 'keen and eager,' to have a second dose, despite trials being halted after another patient suffered possible side-effects.  </p>

<p>Jack Sommers, 35, from London, believes the Oxford University-led trial is safe, adding he is 'mostly just disappointed' about the delay 'because we are all desperate for this vaccine'.</p>

<p>AstraZeneca announced on Tuesday that late-studies of the vaccine had been paused after a UK participant reported a possible side-effect.</p>

<p>Covid vaccine volunteer Jack Sommers said he was 'mostly just disappointed' about the delay</p>

<p>Speaking at yesterday's press conference the Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told the country that such a pause is not unusual during trials. </p>

<p>He said similar stoppages should also be expected in some of the other ongoing vaccine candidate trials. </p>

<p>Experts hope vaccines from the AstraZeneca trial could be given to the public sometime next year. </p>

<p>Mr Sommers, a freelance journalist, had his first injection in May and has since volunteered to have another dose</p>

<p>He said: 'If I was to keel over I would have done it by now. That's why I'm not scared of having it again.' </p>

<p>Mr Sommers says he is keen for a second dose of Oxford University's vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (above)</p>

<p>Mr Sommers said it is a 'statistical inevitability' that at least one patient in the 18,000 on the programme will become ill at some point.</p>

<p>He said: 'This is so careful, it's run by Oxford University, it's got the Government involved and it's got AstraZeneca backing it.</p>

<p>'They've already been through ferrets, mice and monkeys, so they're about as certain as they can reasonably be that it's not going to do anyone any harm.</p>

<p>'My sense is that anyone who volunteered in the first place will not be put off by this, because you've got this appreciation of the risks.'</p>

<p>He said he has been confronted by numerous vaccine sceptics since tweeting about taking part in the trial, and he wants to convince them there is nothing to fear.</p>

<p>'It's just nonsense, it's just the latest type of conspiracy theory that's out there,' Mr Sommers said.</p>

<p>'I kind of understand that vaccines tend to alarm people and always have, and they are a slightly invasive thing. </p>

<p>Sir Patrick Vallance, the Government's chief scientific adviser, told yesterday's daily press conference that it's not unusual to pause medical trials at this stage</p>

<p>'You are, at the end of the day, getting an injection from someone wearing a mask who you don't know and I completely get the human impulse to flee that.</p>

<p>'But they are completely safe, there's no malign agenda and I have learned not to engage with people who tweet at me like 'plandemic' or 'Bill Gates is going to kill you' or 'you're a Covid-idiot', or something like that.</p>

<p>'I am completely ignorant, I'm not a scientist - I did science GCSE and that was it, so I'm just trusting the scientist... the question of where you fall on this I think just depends on how much you trust scientists. And I trust them very much.'</p>
