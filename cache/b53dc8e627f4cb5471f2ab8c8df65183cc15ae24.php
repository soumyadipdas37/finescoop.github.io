<p>The mercury will hit 30C in most suburbs on Thursday, before a southerly change blows the first real taste of summer away.</p>

<p>Weatherzone meterologist Brett Dutschke said the warm weather is 'not unusual' for this time of year, despite being well above the September average.  </p>

<p>'In spring we always get a taste of summer but it's usually brief,' he told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'But having said that, the city's 30C forecast is about 10C above average for this time of the year.</p>

<p>The harbour city will hit 30C in most suburbs on Thursday, before a southerly change blows the taste of summer away</p>

<p>'In the western suburbs its about 7C above average for this time of year.'</p>

<p>According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the average maximum temperature for September - recorded at Observatory Hill in Sydney's CBD - is 20.1C.  </p>

<p>Mr Dutschke said the 30C forecast was widespread across the city but the beaches would linger around the 26C, 27C mark. </p>

<p>He explained the heat has been pulled to the east coast from the interior.  </p>

<p>'Today we've got winds blowing from the north-west and it's drawing some heat from the interior where it has been building for the past few days,' he said.  </p>

<p>'With north-westerly winds, it's drawing that heat closer to the east coast.'</p>

<p>But the summer-like conditions are expected to come to a 'rapid end' with a southerly wind change in the late afternoon. </p>

<p>Mr Dutschke said temperatures should drop 'by about 10C in an hour or two'. </p>

<p>Mr Dutschke said the 30C forecast was widespread across the city but the beaches would linger around the 26C, 27C mark. Pictured: Beachgoers at Bondi</p>

<p>'By the time we get to 6pm, most of Sydney will be colder than 20C, cloudy and later this evening, showers are possible,' he said. </p>

<p>The southerly change will bring 'strong' winds of about 30 to 40km/h on the coast. </p>

<p>'Strong warning for coastal waters in relation to that southerly change and also on the harbour. It will get quite bumpy as well,' Mr Dutschke said. </p>

<p>The winds will ease by Friday and will turn more south-easterly and north-easterly. </p>

<p>There will be increased humidity over the weekend and a chance of showers across the city.  </p>

<p>'Just about everywhere in Sydney is the chance of a shower during Friday and Saturday,' Mr Dutschke said.</p>

<p>NSW Rural Fire Service released a smoke warning on Thursday as they conduct 'controlled hazard reduction burning in a number of areas across NSW over coming days'.</p>

<p>'Smoke from these planned burns may settle in a number of areas in particular parts of the Greater Sydney, Illawarra, Central Coast, Armidale, Inverell, Liverpool Plains and Mid Coast areas,' they said.  </p>

<p>NSW RFS warned smoked from bush fires and hazard reduction burning can affect some people more than others.</p>

<p>Children, older adults and people with heart and lung conditions are most susceptible to air pollution and excessive smoke. </p>

<p>'If you have asthma or a lung condition, reduce outdoor activities if smoke levels are high and if shortness of breath or coughing develops, take your reliever medicine or seek medical advice,' NSW RFS said. </p>
