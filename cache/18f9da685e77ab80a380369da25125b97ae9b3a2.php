<p>A Morrison's shopper shared their disgust at the supermarket supplying selling a giant 'sack of wet boiled eggs' on their shelves</p>

<p>Twitter users were left gobsmacked after a user goes by the name <?php echo e('@'); ?>TrumpetSexy, shared two pictured of the 'wretched and cursed' eggs, stocked in the meal deal section </p>

<p>Sharing a picture of the bizarre product, the user penned: My local Morrison's is selling actual sacks of wet eggs', to which the supermarket quickly replied </p>

<p>They continued: 'Also it’s in the meal deal section, which implies this is considered lunch ? Does this count as a main, or a snack?? I have so many questions, and no answers.' </p>

<p>The supermarket were quick to defend themselves, tweeting in reply: 'You see a cursed item but all I see is a bargain #weteggwin'. </p>

<p>Baffled users quickly took to Twitter to bemoan the bag of eggs, with many commenting that the sack had far more than five inside. </p>

<p>'Why does it say '5 boiled eggs' like we can't see with our eyes that it's 70', wrote one. </p>

<p>The bag, which also contained an unknown preservative, quickly stirred up a social media frenzy, with many baffled at the sheer quantity of eggs</p>

<p>Another commented: 'I didn’t know this before now but 2020 is a sack of wet eggs.' </p>

<p>A third said: 'Why does it say 5 boiled eggs when clearly there are at least 20... why can I smell this through the screen..... why does the preservative look like urine.' </p>

<p>The user continued to rage: 'Who drinks 50 boiled eggs for dinner.. what kind of creature would subject other living things.. to the after smell of themselves having guzzled 50 eggs... and egg wee... you'd be a walking methane factory... a methane bus could literally refuel off of one persons waste after this.'  </p>

<p>However Twitter users were soon able to get to the bottom of the odd new addition to the shelves, with one revealing the eggs are usually used for the supermarket's salad bar</p>

<p>One write: 'I worked in Morrison's so can confirm that these eggs in a preservative for the salad bar. We didn't boil the eggs or de-shell them, they came like this. Not sure why they're being sold on shelves maybe they're about to expire?? But not sure why everyone's freaking out over it</p>

<p>Another user confirmed: 'Ours has been doing this since March - I'm assuming it's something to do with the self serve salad bit being unavailable/underused. </p>

<p>'Also big laughs at them pretending there's only 5 eggs in there when it's clearly a bag of 48.' </p>
