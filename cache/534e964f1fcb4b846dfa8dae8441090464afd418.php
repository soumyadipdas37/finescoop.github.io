<p>Calls for cannabis to be decriminalised are growing with one MP saying the drug is no more addictive than booze or tobacco. </p>

<p>New South Wales Labor MP Rose Jackson told parliament on September 23 legalising the drug would be 'economically sensible'.</p>

<p>She argued that the state should follow in the steps of Joe Biden in the US, contradicting Opposition Leader Jodi McKay. </p>

<p>'Over 33 countries have decriminalised or legalised cannabis and if Joe Biden wins the US election all of America will have decriminalised cannabis,' she told Daily Mail Australia.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ms Mckay told The Daily Telegraph the NSW Labor Party 'does not support decriminalisation of recreational cannabis use'. </p>

<p>Ms Jackson said it was an 'unbelievable waste' of police and corrections resources to enforce prohibition on the drug.</p>

<p>'It is no more addictive or harmful than alcohol or tobacco and may in fact be less harmful,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Jackson told Daily Mail Australia she has supported the cause from the start of her political career. </p>

<p>'At the very least we should be having a public conversation about decriminalising cannabis,' she said.</p>

<p>'Millions of Australian's have tried cannabis at least once and I reckon it is a conversation a lot of people want our leaders to start having.'  </p>

<p>Ms Jackson said she believed cannabis was no more addictive or harmful than alcohol or tobacco and NSW needed to be 'on the right side of history' (stock picture)</p>

<p>The MP said overwhelming public support for the idea could not be ignored.</p>

<p>'Let us get New South Wales on the right side of history and decriminalise cannabis in this state,' she said.</p>

<p>Her comments came after US presidential candidate Joe Biden pledged to overhaul cannabis prohibition if we won the US election. </p>

<p>'It is New South Wales that is lagging in not even conducting a public conversation about this issue,' she said. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Ms McKay's office for further comment.  </p>

<p>Drug Free Australia also slammed the MP's comments and said cannabis was as dangerous as tobacco and increased the risk of psychosis (stock picture)</p>
