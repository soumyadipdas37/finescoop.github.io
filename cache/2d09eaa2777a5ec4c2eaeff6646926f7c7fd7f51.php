<p>The Reds purchased Thiago from Bayern Munich for a deal worth £25million earlier this month and made his debut in Liverpool's 2-0 win against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge last weekend.</p>

<p>Arteta was speaking at his pre-match press conference as his side face two trips to Anfield with the first coming in the Premier League on Monday night. </p>

<p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta believes new Liverpool signing Thiago Alcantara is 'special'</p>

<p>The Reds purchased Thiago from Bayern Munich for a deal worth £25million earlier this month</p>

<p>Asked if Arsenal tried to sign Thiago, Arteta said: 'We don't discuss the things we try and do in the market, but I like him from my time in Barcelona.</p>

<p>'Incredible personality, great talent, very special, great qualities to play in midfield and yes, I think he is a great signing for Liverpool.'</p>

<p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will miss Monday's visit of Arsenal as he has not fully recovered from the knock which forced him off at half-time of Sunday's win at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The absence of the England midfielder increases the chance of a first start for new signing Thiago, who was Henderson's replacement at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>Klopp also received some good news with Joe Gomez set to return to training to give him the option of restoring his first-choice centre-back partnership, having been forced to play midfielder Fabinho there last weekend.</p>

<p>'Joe should be back today in training. Billy the Kid (17-year-old centre-back Billy Koumetio) is back in training. Joel (Matip) is not. Hendo is not yet, this game is for sure too early.' </p>

<p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will miss Monday's visit of Arsenal after not recovering</p>

<p>New arrival Thiago impressed after he replaced Henderson at Stamford Bridge, and Jurgen Klopp hinted that he could make his first start for the Reds.</p>

<p>'We will see. We have a few days to train, some boys have to recover so we will see how we set up. </p>

<p>'I have an idea but we time until Monday. He (Thiago) is in contention for sure. Let's see.' </p>
