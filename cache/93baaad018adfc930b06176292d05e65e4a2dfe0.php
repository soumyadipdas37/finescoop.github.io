<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel, EU Council President Charles Michel (pictured front) and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (pictured back) later said they also urged the Chinese leader to grant access for independent observers to Xinjiang</p>

<p>'On Xinjiang issues, China always welcomes friends from other countries, including European countries, to take a look at Xinjiang and understand the real situation on the ground, instead of relying on hearsay or deliberately fabricated lies,' he added. </p>

<p>China has rebuffed past calls to grant independent access to Xinjiang, and the spokesman didn't confirm that EU observers would be allowed to travel freely in the region.</p>

<p>Chinese officials have repeatedly denied allegations of genocide, forced sterilisation and the mass detention of nearly 1 million Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang as lies fabricated by anti-China forces. </p>

<p>They claim that the Uighurs are treated equally and that Beijing always protects the rights of China's ethnic minorities.  </p>

<p>China says criticism of its handling of Xinjiang is politically motivated, and based on lies about what happens in the vast facilities it has built.</p>

<p>The EU joins the US in taking China to task over its treatment of minorities in Xinjiang.</p>

<p>On Monday US customs said it would bar a raft of Chinese products including cotton, garments and hair products, from Xinjiang over fears they were made using forced labour.</p>
