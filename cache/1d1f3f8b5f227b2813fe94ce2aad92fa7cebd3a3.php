<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham have asked Inter Milan about the availability of defender Milan Skriniar, but they will reportedly have to pay £55million to get their man, according to Sky Sport Italia.  </p>

<p>The Slovakian was dropped towards the end of last season by Antonio Conte as he didn't fit into the three-at-the-back system he had introduced. </p>

<p>The two clubs are in talks, but are said to still be in preliminary discussions.</p>

<p>Tottenham will have to pay £55million to Inter Milan if they want defender Milan Skriniar (L)</p>

<p>Spurs reportedly tried to use Tanguy Ndombele as a makeweight but Inter have refused</p>

<p>Skriniar has played 128 games for Inter Milan since arriving in 2017 from Sampdoria. He has also made 33 appearances for the Slovakia national team. </p>

<p>With a fairly high price tag, Spurs have apparently tried to add in Tanguy Ndombele as a makeweight. </p>

<p>However the Italian club are not interested, and only want cash if they are to part with the defender. </p>

<p>Tottenham have been fairly active in the transfer market, so may not want to fork over the cash</p>

<p>Conte still wants to do business on the transfer market after bringing in Arturo Vidal from Barcelona, and needs the funds to do so. </p>

<p>Tottenham have already spent upwards of £75million on new signings this summer, including Giovani Lo Celso and Sergio Reguilon. </p>

<p>So Jose Mourinho may not be able to spend the full amount without offloading more of his current players. </p>
