<p>Swathes of the North West and North East are struggling with large outbreaks while the virus remains under control in most of the South.</p>

<p>However, cases have also risen sharply in London over the past fortnight, which could lead to 9million people in the capital being placed under a local lockdown.</p>

<p>Coronavirus infections continue to soar in the North of England despite draconian restrictions imposed upon millions of residents</p>

<p>But the infection rate in London boroughs is still significantly lower than the worst-hit areas of the North West, where there are currently 439 Covid-19 patients in hospital – up from 174 a fortnight ago.</p>

<p>Bolton, which has the highest current infection rate in England, has had 213 new cases per 100,000 people in the past week.</p>

<p>Other hotspots include Liverpool, where the rate is 170, and Manchester, where it is 153.</p>

<p>Cities in the North East are also badly affected. </p>

<p>Newcastle has a seven-day case average of 159 per 100,000, while the rate is 132 in Sunderland and 52 in Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>Areas of the Midlands, including Leicester, which was the UK's first city to be put in a local lockdown, continue to struggle with outbreaks. </p>

<p>But there is no evidence of a second wave of the virus in most of the South, although London is on the brink of a lockdown. There are currently 206 virus patients in London hospitals.</p>

<p>Swathes of the North West and North East are struggling with large outbreaks. The map shows each area's probability of becoming a hotspot by October 3</p>

<p>However, in April almost 5,000 virus patients were in hospital in the capital. </p>

<p>Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan and Boris Johnson discussed the recent worsening situation in the capital earlier this week and health officials are said to favour tougher restrictions.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Mr Khan said: 'They discussed the rapidly-worsening situation in London, including increasing intensive care unit admission rates and the need to go further now to prevent a disastrous full lockdown in future – including mandatory face coverings for hospitality workers and more widespread wearing of face coverings.'</p>

<p>Of the 32 boroughs in London, only one – Redbridge – has an infection rate over 50 per 100,000. </p>

<p>In several parts of the capital, the rates are below 20 per 100,000, but health officials are concerned by a gradual upturn in hospital admissions. </p>

<p>No areas of London are currently included in Public Health England's local authority 'watchlist'.</p>

<p>Virus deaths in the capital remain low, with 21 in hospitals over the past fortnight. Professor Kevin Fenton, of Public Health England in London, said: 'We are seeing a rising tide of coronavirus cases in London across a broad range of ages. </p>

<p>'This is no longer limited to young people in their 20s.</p>

<p>'Whilst the number of cases by borough varies, the general trend across the city is one of steadily increasing transmission and if that continues then the situation may escalate'. </p>

<p>Local lockdown restrictions currently cover 13million people in the UK.</p>

<p>The Government is considering using a traffic light system that will send automatic alerts to people's mobile phones in order to trigger local lockdowns.</p>

<p>Under the system, local infection rates will be used to split parts of the country into one of three categories – red, amber or green – that will determine the restrictions in place. </p>

<p>This system will work in tandem with the NHS test and trace app, which includes a feature where users can scan a barcode to check in and out of bars and restaurants. </p>
