<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A trainee lawyer has praised the 'gentlemen' Chris Eubank and David Haye for coming to her rescue when she was hit by a Mercedes. </p>

<p>Armandine Pohecoula, 25, was struck by the car on the Albert Embankment on her way home to south London on Tuesday when the two champion boxers rushed to her aid.</p>

<p>Eubank, 54, and Haye, 39, had not been together and it was pure coincidence that the two titans were on hand to wait with the young woman until an ambulance arrived. </p>

<p>Speaking from home, Ms Pohecoula told The Sun: 'When I fell onto the road someone came out to help, I didn't know who he was. He kept asking "are you OK, are you OK?" </p>

<p>Eubank can be seen crouching near to the injured lady as she tries to get back to her feet</p>

<p>The boxers waited until the woman was reached by ambulance crews they flagged down</p>

<p>'After about ten minutes someone leaned over to me and said that he was famous. Obviously I now realise that that man was Chris Eubank.</p>

<p>'I was in a lot of pain but he kept telling me that help was coming. He held my hand and stayed with me for about twenty minutes.</p>

<p>'Then David came and asked if everything was alright and if I was OK. It was all a bit of a blur.'</p>

<p>Ms Pohecoula said that she was quite bruised on her arms and legs but was fine otherwise. </p>

<p>She added: 'I just want to thank them both for being gentlemen. Lots of people walked past but they didn't hesitate to help.' </p>

<p>Eubank played down any suggestion he was a hero - insisting he had just been down his civic duty along with his friend, Haye. </p>

<p>Team-up: David Haye and Chris Eubank were both on the scene to help the injured woman</p>

<p>Eubank told The Sun he'd heard some a bang and was the first to get there and comforted Ms Pohecoula on the ground.</p>

<p>It was soon after that Haye appeared, asking: 'Can I help too.'</p>

<p>Haye said he'd been walking up to a meeting in Soho from his hotel south of the river when he'd spotted the commotion.</p>

<p>The former heavyweight champion added that Eubank had it all under control in any case, 'he is a sheriff after all,' Haye said. </p>

<p>Eubank is indeed a city marshal in Opelousas, Louisiana, and has the right to arrest people. </p>

<p>It is not clear whether the police are investigating the incident.  </p>
