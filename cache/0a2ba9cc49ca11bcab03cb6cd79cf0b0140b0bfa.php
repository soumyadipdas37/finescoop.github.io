<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you squinted, you could almost believe that everything was back to normal. </p>

<p>Outside, fans clad in red and white trudged through the woods and the beer flowed freely at the matchday pubs. Inside, when the players came out to warm up, they were greeted with a roar rather than with silence.</p>

<p>As the Bundesliga returned to action this week, so did its fans, many of them for the first time since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>Fans returned to football stadiums in Germany this weekend, including at Union Berlin (above)</p>

<p>Augsburg ran out 3-1 winners against the Bundesliga minnows on Saturday afternoon</p>

<p>In Germany's capital city, where local rules allow mass events of up to 5,000 people, matchday at Bundesliga minnows Union Berlin almost felt like a proper matchday again. Albeit one with considerably smaller crowds.</p>

<p>'I would normally get 2000 customers coming through when there's a game on. I will get about 150 today,' grumbled Frank Seifert, landlord at the 'Tanke', a popular pre-match beer garden. 'But we've opened anyway, just to show we are still here. It's a very, very small start.'</p>

<p>Of the 22,000 fans who would normally cram into the Alte Foersterei, only 4,600 were allowed in this weekend, with tickets allocated via a lottery among season-ticket holders. </p>

<p>Just 4,600 fans were allowed  into the Alte Foersterei - but they still made a lot of noise</p>

<p>'You'll all have to sing for at least four people today,' stadium announcer Christian Arbeit told the fans before the game. They obliged, screaming the roof off even as their team went down 3-1 to relegation rivals Augsburg.</p>

<p>'It might take us some time to get used to having supporters again,' Union coach Urs Fischer had warned before the game. And after so many games played out in silence, even just a few thousand fans were enough to bring out goosebumps. </p>

<p>Quiet - generally a rare occurrence at this ground - descended only when there was confusion about which song to sing next. The ultras, who would normally decide such things, are staying away 'until we can come to the stadium without restrictions'.</p>

<p>Union Berlin's 'ultras' have decided to stay away from the ground until COVID-19 is over</p>

<p>For those who did come, there were restrictions aplenty. Masks were compulsory when walking to and from your seat, while new painted markings ensured social distancing in the standing areas. </p>

<p>Perhaps most devastating of all for the German football fan, though, was the ban on beer. In front of the press box, two old boys looked forlornly into cups of fizzy water as they took their seats.</p>

<p>'The alcohol ban is nonsense,' Union fan Frank Riemann told Sportsmail - but added that it was important that supporters behaved themselves. 'We have to keep to the rules because we want to get back to a full stadium.'</p>

<p>Not even a ban on beer could dampen the spirits of the fans who returned football once again</p>

<p>As unlikely as it sounds, that remains the big goal in this part of the world. In July, Union announced an audacious plan to return to full capacity with the help of mass testing.  </p>

<p>Political reality has put that project on the back burner for now, but the club did at least negotiate an exception to a ban on standing tickets. Had they not, the little Alte Försterei would have had temporary seats drilled into its three terraced stands - a sure sign of impending apocalypse for most Berlin fans.</p>

<p>'If we hadn't been allowed to stand, I wouldn't have come,' said 19-year-old Union supporter Mark as he carried an enormous flag towards the stadium before kick-off. </p>

<p>Fans were allowed to stand up behind the goal in the ground despite the health restrictions</p>

<p>'I'm just happy that I get to see at least one game, because you never know what will happen tomorrow. I expect there to be a second wave,' he said.</p>

<p>He may well be right. If case numbers continue to rise into the winter, then Germany may also return to empty stadiums before long. </p>

<p>But as the late summer sun set over the few thousand fans in south-east Berlin on Saturday, that prospect seemed a world away. </p>

<p>For a brief moment, everything was almost back to normal.</p>
