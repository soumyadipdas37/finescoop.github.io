<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Schapelle Corby is one of the famous faces taking part in Channel Seven's new military-style reality show SAS Australia.</p>

<p>But reports suggest that the 43-year-old convicted drug smuggler was 'iced out' by the rest of the cast during filming in the NSW Snowy Mountains.</p>

<p>Her co-star Merrick Watts addressed the speculation on Hughesy &amp; Ed on Monday, and seemingly hinted that the rumours weren't true.</p>

<p>Revealed: Appearing on the Hughesy &amp; Ed show on Monday, Schapelle's fellow SAS Australia star, Merrick Watts(pictured) broke his silence on filming the Channel Seven series with her</p>

<p>'There has been a lot of conjecture about Schapelle Corby and how she was treated by the rest of the cast,' the 46-year-old comedian said.  </p>

<p>'I'm here to tell you the only time anyone got upset with Schapelle was me... because I was bought on the show as the drug trafficker and I found out she was doing my gear I was very very upset!' he added.</p>

<p>Merrick's humourous response seems to suggest that the cast warmed to Schapelle despite her notoriety and didn't give her the cold shoulder. </p>

<p>Gruelling: Merrick went on to add that the series is '100 per cent real' and that 'there is no script writing and production involved'. Pictured: Schapelle Corby on SAS Australia </p>

<p>Merrick went on to say that SAS Australia was '100 per cent real' and that there was 'no script writing and production involved'.</p>

<p>'Once you start that show is is absolutely break-neck speed,' he said. </p>

<p>His comments come after several reports emerged claiming that Schapelle was 'iced out' by her co-stars while filming for the series.</p>

<p>Both Woman's Day and New Idea claimed she was shunned by the other celebrities, who did not believe a convicted criminal deserved to be there. </p>

<p>Outcast: Convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby was allegedly 'iced out' by her FUMING celebrity cast mates during filming of  Seven's new military-style show SAS Australia</p>

<p>'Some of the more high-profile celebs were fuming,' a source told Woman's Day, adding that several stars didn't want to 'associate with her' at all.</p>

<p>Sydney PR queen Roxy Jacenko was allegedly very unhappy to be sharing the screen with Schapelle, who spent nine years in a Bali jail for marijuana smuggling.</p>

<p>'When [Roxy] learnt Schapelle was going on the series, she was not impressed,' a source claimed to New Idea.</p>

<p>The source added: 'Roxy wanted to be the alpha female, but Schapelle immediately stole her thunder.' </p>

<p>Fuming: It has also been alleged that Sydney PR queen Roxy Jacenko (pictutred) was particularly unhappy the former Bali inmate was taking part</p>
