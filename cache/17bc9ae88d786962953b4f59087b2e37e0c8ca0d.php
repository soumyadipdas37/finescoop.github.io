<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Black Lives Matter protester was arrested and bundled into a van on a seven-year-old warrant after calling police 'pigs' and saying he wanted to 'take their heads off with a hand saw'. </p>

<p>Jeremy Logan says he was driven away in an unmarked van and kept in custody for more than a day while on his way to a protest in Spokane, Washington. </p>

<p>Logan, the chair of a local Democratic Socialists of America branch, told HuffPost that he was arrested on a 2013 drugs warrant which has only now been fulfilled. </p>

<p>Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich hit back in a lengthy press conference where he insisted that Logan's arrest was 'not a political issue'. </p>

<p>However, the Republican sheriff admitted that officers had been monitoring Logan's online rhetoric in the lead-up to his arrest. </p>

<p>Jeremy Logan (pictured) says he was driven away in an unmarked van and kept in custody for more than a day while on his way to a protest in Spokane, Washington</p>

<p>Logan said he was arrested on August 30 after plain-clothes officers grabbed him and told him he was under arrest on a warrant. </p>

<p>He says that up to eight plain-clothed men handcuffed him and bundled him into an unmarked van before driving him to city police. </p>

<p>Logan was wearing a shirt with the slogan ACAB or 'All Cops Are B***ards', which he says was 'not taken lightly' by the arresting officers. </p>

<p>Two friends witnessed the arrest and told HuffPost that it was 'scary'. Logan was released a day later when his father paid a $500 bond.</p>

<p>Logan said the 2013 warrant related to unpaid fines relating to a failure to appear in court on drugs charges. </p>

<p>Responding to the claims, Sheriff Knezovich gave a press conference in which berated HuffPost's coverage and highlighted examples of Antifa violence. </p>

<p>He said that the arresting officers did have badges around their necks when they detained Logan, who he said had joined the recent CHAZ protests in Seattle. </p>

<p>Knezovich pointed out Logan's Facebook posts, calling them 'threatening, 'violent' and 'ISIS-like' after Logan spoke about 'taking these pigs' heads off with a saw'. </p>

<p>'So why was he arrested? He was a convicted felon with a warrant and yes, he knew he had the warrant, and yes, he had been contacted before,' the sheriff said.</p>

<p>Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich hit back in a lengthy press conference where he insisted that Logan's arrest was 'not a political issue'</p>

<p>Knezovich continued: 'But he [Logan] also upped the ante by making threats and his rhetoric was increasingly violent. </p>

<p>'His name got brought to us, we just kind of looked at it, and Mr Logan had a warrant and it went from there.'  </p>

<p>'Logan is not the victim here. He is a felon who had a warrant,' the sheriff said, saying that officers had been looking for Logan since before the Facebook posts.  </p>

<p>'America is the victim of Antifa's agenda and the media's continued pushing of a false narrative that these people don't exist,' he said.  </p>

<p>The sheriff also insisted that his office had taken action against right-wing extremists in the past as well as left-wing protesters. </p>

<p>Knezovich has also criticized Antifa on Twitter, saying the movement 'isn't about race, they don't care about BLM, it's about the overthrow of our government'. </p>

<p>'They are violent and have shown America what life will look like if they succeed,' he said on Monday. </p>

<p>President Trump has linked Antifa to the wave of protests which erupted in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis in May.  </p>

<p>Trump said that the US would designate Antifa as a 'terrorist organization', although in reality it has little formal structure.  </p>
