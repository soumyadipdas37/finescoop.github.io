<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Seven out of eight states and territories have agreed to work on a plan that would see borders come down by December.</p>

<p>But Western Australia, which has an election in March, has refused to take part.  </p>

<p>Scott Morrison said he felt like Australia could break apart due to border closures</p>

<p>Earlier on Friday Annastacia Palaszczuk has told the Morrison government to stop 'intimidating' her over her state's tough border restrictions.</p>

<p>She also claimed any state which was awarded the AFL grand final would have made the same decision to allow hundreds of staff, players and WAGs to enter.</p>

<p>The Queensland premier has come under fire from federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg and other government MPs for keeping the border closed to parts of New South Wales and the ACT that have no community transmission of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Annastacia Palaszczuk has told the Morrison government to stop 'intimidating' her over her state's tough borders</p>

<p>She said he found the criticism 'intimidating' and that it upsets her family. </p>

<p>'It is relentless, it is intimidating. But I will not be intimidated,' she told reporters today. </p>

<p>'I get out of bed every day and do my job but my family are very upset... But I tell them to hang in there.' </p>

<p>Despite the criticism she faces, Ms Palaszczuk said she would not open her borders anytime soon. </p>

<p>'I think it's a bit disingenuous for this heightened criticism that is coming from a whole lot of levels when our fundamental concern is to look after Queenslanders and to make sure that they are safe during this time,' she said.</p>

<p>'I do not want to see what has happened in our aged care sector in NSW and in Victoria happen here in Queensland. That would be a nightmare.' </p>

<p>Queensland recorded zero new coronavirus cases overnight after 13,000 tests.        </p>

<p>The state's chief health officer Jeanette Young said a state would need to have 28 days with no community transmission before residents are allowed in to Queensland. </p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk said: 'If we all focus our efforts on Victoria and New South Wales and getting community transmission under control... then there will come a time when everybody can open up.'  </p>

<p>Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham said it was a 'very, very high benchmark to set'.</p>

<p>NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said: 'I don't know if we'll ever get to that number. They're putting on a pretty big ask during a pandemic.' </p>

<p>On Wednesday Mr Frydenberg slammed Ms Palaszczuk's decision to allow the families of AFL players into the state. </p>

<p>'I think the Queensland Premier has got some questions to answer here,' he told A Current Affair. </p>

<p>Should states open their borders?</p>

<p>Should states open their borders?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>'How can it be okay for people to go up to prepare for a footy game, and its not okay to go to hospital for treatment?'</p>

<p>Mr Frydenberg referenced several tragic examples of New South Wales locals not being allowed to cross the border during the pandemic.</p>

<p>'How can it be okay that a young woman loses an unborn child because of border confusion... that a four-year-old boy with cancer can be separated from his mother? </p>

<p>'These are cruel and confused implications from these strict border approaches... I think everyone needs to get a grip here and remember that we're first and last Australians.' </p>

<p>October 24 will mark the first time in the AFL's 124-year history that the grand final has been played outside of Melbourne, due to Victoria's outbreak.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk insisted it was a 'huge win' for Queenslanders and said that any state that won the chance to host the final would have let the players and their families enter. </p>

<p>'It's almost like we're being criticised because we won it,' she said.  </p>

<p>Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said: 'When the premier of Queensland can allow 400 AFL executives to swan around a resort in the Gold Coast, but won't allow teenage boarding school children to go home to see their parents into remote New South Wales, that is abhorrent.</p>

<p>'It's wrong. Australians don't do that to other Australians.'  </p>

<p>Scott Morrison has tried to persuade state and territory leaders to open up their borders. </p>

<p>The prime minister accepts Victoria must be sealed off due to its second wave outbreak, which is behind 87 per cent of all Australia's Covid-19 deaths and still ongoing with relatively high levels of community transmission.</p>

<p>From a conference room in Parliament House Scott Morrison (pictured) will host a video call with the state and territory leaders and try to persuade them to open their borders</p>

<p>But increasing movement between other states is essential to save the nation's dying tourism industry, which employs one million workers and is set to lose a staggering $54.6billion this year due to lockdowns and border restrictions.</p>

<p>Greater freedom will also help farmers, residents in border towns, and hundreds of thousands of Aussie families who are trapped apart in different states.</p>

<p>Ms Palaszczuk has adopted nationalist rhetoric, pitting her state against the rest of Australia and even declaring that Queensland hospitals are 'for our people'.</p>

<p>Ten days after that comment, a mother from Ballina, near the Queensland border, lost her unborn twin after she was flown 700km to Sydney for surgery because an exemption allowing her into Queensland took too long. </p>

<p>Then on Wednesday, the premier let hundreds of AFL players, WAGs and officials waltz into Queensland after clapping and wooping when Brisbane was handed the AFL grand final scheduled for 24 October.</p>

<p>Queensland grandmother Jayne Brown, 60, who was made to do hotel quarantine in in Brisbane following brain surgery, said the unfairness was 'mind-blowing'. </p>
