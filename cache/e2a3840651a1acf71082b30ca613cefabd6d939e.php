<p>Ms Lacey's daughter said: 'My mother was on a conference call with her company at the time and Bobble had decided to climb up her leg onto her lap and then walked up her arm and had jumped on her head.</p>

<p>'He then proceeded to sit there for five minutes before deciding that it was a good place to take a nap so he lay down and fell asleep.</p>

<p>'Me and my mother had both found it very funny, I burst out laughing.</p>
