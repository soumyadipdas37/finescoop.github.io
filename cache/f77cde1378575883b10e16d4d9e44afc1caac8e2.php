<p>MailOnline has contacted Metropolitan Police for comment.  </p>

<p>It comes a month after supercars were surrounded by police after drivers raced through wealthy London neighbourhoods past midnight on July 31 into August 1.</p>

<p>Revving engines kept those living along Sloane Street, between Knightsbridge and Belgravia, awake into the early hours of the morning as cars worth hundreds of thousands of pounds streaked along the road.</p>

<p>Some 18 police officers were called to the road where some cars were surrounded while the drivers' details were checked. </p>

<p>Officers found cars with missing number plates as they issued warnings for loud exhausts and anti-social driving after a number of calls were made to 999. </p>

<p>A Lamborghini, Porsche, and high power BMWs were among a number of vehicles stopped on the popular shopping street last night in a bid to cut down on racing.</p>

<p>Last year Kensington and Chelsea council asked the Government to bring in new 'acoustic cameras' that activate when noisy vehicles exceed a certain decibel limit. </p>

<p>Councillor Johnny Thalassites warned that situation was reaching 'crisis point'. He wrote to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps to ask for the region to be included in a UK trial of the cameras, the Evening Standard reported.</p>

<p>Mr Thalassites said: 'Powerful cars need careful handling and, unfortunately, our borough has seen and heard how certain drivers mistake our streets for a car show. This has been going on for years and it's reaching crisis point.</p>

<p>'Acoustic cameras would give us a powerful new tool to catch drivers flouting the rules of the road.' </p>

<p>He added that the council consistently heard from residents who were 'blighted' by the noise, explaining that drivers set the high-performance car to race mode and rev the engines while stationary in crowded areas.  </p>

<p>The council had handed out 148 fines of up to £1,000 to drivers since they were introduced in 2015, but this does not seem to have been an effective deterrent. </p>

<p>In June 2019 the Department for Transport said it would trial the noise-detecting cameras over a seven-month period.</p>

<p>The cameras have microphones that detect vehicles breaking the legal noise limit, and if the car exceeds 74 decibels the camera takes a picture of the registration number to send the owner a fine. </p>

<p>In July this year £25million worth of Koenigseggs were delivered to wealthy customers in Sunningdale, Berkshire, as 'supercar season' started hotting up.   </p>

<p>The hotter months sees wealthy people from Arabic countries flee the scorching temperatures of the Middle East and cruise around London, with rich Kuwaitis, Saudis and Emiratis seeking to out-do each other over who can own the most fancy sportscar.  </p>

<p>The cars' owners tend to ship their machines over in the months leading up to the summer, so they are here when they arrive in July and August. </p>

<p>Owners fly their expensive and often highly customised vehicles over to the UK for a holiday, costing upwards of quarter of a million pounds.</p>

<p>Rich owners will pay a small fortune - in excess of £20,000 for a return journey - for their vehicles to be flown around 3,000 miles, and often leave them parked in some of London's most desirable spots.</p>

<p>But less-than-impressed neighbours often complain about excessive noise and poor parking by some drivers.  </p>

<p>Noise cameras are already in use in Canada, Singapore, Australia and the United Arab Emirates, but they are new to Britain.  </p>

<p>In 2017 it emerged that the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea had levied more than £10,000 in fines and legal costs from drivers who revved their engines in Knightsbridge. </p>

<p>They were fined for breaching a legal order after residents of the affluent area complained about noisy supercars.</p>
