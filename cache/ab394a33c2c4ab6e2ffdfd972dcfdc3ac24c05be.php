<p>'I got this great gift idea from this group! My hubby's first Father's Day,' she said on Facebook.</p>

<p>'I may need some more boxes for future gifts (well that's my excuse anyway), back to online shopping.'</p>

<p>On each wall of the boxes, Jessica stuck Ferrero Rocher chocolates, Lindt, Skittles packets, m&amp;m packets, Snickers, $50 cash, new phone chargers and assorted other gifts inside.</p>

<p>In the centre of the box was a personalised card that read 'Jada loves daddy this much' and had a photo at the bottom of a child with their arms wide open. </p>
