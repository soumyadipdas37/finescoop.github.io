<p>The wealthy playboy grandson of Kazakhstan's former president was summoned to court today for breaching the terms of a suspended sentence more than a month after he died.</p>

<p>The late Aisultan Nazarbayev, 30, was spared jail last year for biting a police sergeant's arm and stripping in an elderly woman's home.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev had been shouting 'terrorist comments' from the rooftops before he sunk his teeth into PS Ross Sambrook's arm at a flat on Covent Garden's Drury Lane in London on June 5, 2019.</p>

<p>The officer was left scarred and in need of a tetanus shot when he charged at him after being tasered four times in the genitals, Southwark Crown Court heard.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and destroying property. On October 18, 2019, he was ordered to pay £5,000 compensation and a £1,000 fine with £500 costs.</p>

<p>He was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months and ordered to undertake 140 hours of unpaid work and 20 days of drug rehabilitation treatment.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev was ordered to attend court for failing to complete his unpaid work requirement.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev had been the favourite grandson of longtime ex-president Nursultan Nazarbayev (pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi in September 2015)</p>

<p>But news of his death from suspected heart failure on August 16 came as a surprise to both the prosecutor and the judge.</p>

<p>Toby Roseman, prosecuting, said: 'Before I continue with this hearing, I just found out from a reporter that Mr Nazarbayev might have died in August, according to the Mirror Online. I am not sure if that is definitely correct.</p>

<p>'The breach, without going into too much detail, with purports to attendance during August so it would deal with the time scale of him perhaps dying.'</p>

<p>Judge David Tomlinson said: 'That is, of course, completely news to me. I remember the case quite well.'</p>

<p>The judge asked for enquiries to be made to verify that this 'sad information' was correct.</p>

<p>He added: 'Obviously, without that information I would have been issuing a warrant. On the basis of what I have been told that would be completely inappropriate.</p>

<p>'We may need to have another hearing if that turns out to be the case, if it turns out Mr Nazarbayev has indeed died.'</p>

<p>Nazarbayev had broken into an elderly woman's flat and destroyed her belongings before using her washing machine to launder his clothes and putting his passport and wallet in her chest of drawers.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev was serenaded at his wedding by Kanye West (pictured in South Carolina in July)</p>

<p>Ksevia Shevelevra was left unable to sleep when she came home to find a porcelain pot collection smashed across the floor and blood-stained cashmere clothing strewn about the flat.</p>

<p>Police had been called to the International Park Plaza Hotel two days earlier after Nazarbayev climbed onto the balcony and threatened to jump.</p>

<p>They were summoned again to the Drury Lane address where he jumped onto a second pensioner's patio to escape after being cornered by PS Sambrook.</p>

<p>Police bodycam footage played to the court showed the Kazakhstani shouting while crawling across the floor towards the pensioner's door as she stood frozen in fear in her dressing gown.</p>

<p>He screamed in agony as he was tasered four times in the genitals but then jumped to his feet and gnawed at PS Sambrook's arm before falling to the floor saying: 'I forgive you.'</p>

<p>The sergeant can be heard yelling: 'Get f<strong><em>ing down. Get on your f*****g back. He f</em></strong>ing bit me' to a second officer who arrived as back-up while blood spatters across the patio floor.</p>

<p>Southwark Crown Court (file picture) heard the attacked police officer was left scarred and in need of a tetanus shot when Nazarbayev charged at him after being tasered in the genitals </p>

<p>The former spy was found dead in his London flat in August after seeking political asylum in Britain for alleging he had evidence of million-dollar corruption with links to Russia.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev, who died of suspected heart failure, had earlier claimed he was afraid for his life.</p>

<p>He was the grandson of Nursultan Nazarbayev, former president of Kazakhstan who ruled the country from 1990 to March 2019.</p>

<p>He served as the vice-president of the country's national football federation in 2017.</p>

<p>Nazarbayev had been the favourite grandson of longtime ex-president Nursultan Nazarbayev and was once groomed as a future leader of Kazakhstan.</p>

<p>He was said to have attended the Sandhurst royal military academy on Prince Andrew's recommendation and was serenaded at his wedding by Kanye West.</p>

<p>At his sentencing hearing last month, Michael Wolkind, QC, defending, described his offences as 'a cry of desperation'.</p>

<p>The barrister said Nazarbayev had a 'serious' cocaine habit and mental health problems including depression.</p>
