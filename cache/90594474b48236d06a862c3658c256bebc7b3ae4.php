<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Shocking footage has emerged showing two men who were accused of assaulting police being pepper sprayed, choked and kneed in the head at a popular restaurant.</p>

<p>Oskar Sarkans and Peter James Kleinschafer were set to appear at Southport Magistrates Court on the Gold Coast on Tuesday, charged with bashing police, public nuisance and obstructing officers.</p>

<p>But the trial was sensationally called off on Monday evening with new video emerging of the encounter appearing to show police use excessive force. </p>

<p>The accused never retaliated or attacked the officers during the clip. </p>

<p>Oskar Sarkans is pictured with his hand covering his face as he is being pepper sprayed by police</p>

<p>The incident unfolded last year on December 28 at a busy Paradise Point eatery.</p>

<p>A manager at an adjacent restaurant had called police to complain 'bikies' had urinated in a alley nearby. </p>

<p>When police arrived at the scene, the situation quickly escalated. </p>

<p>Mr Sarkans is a model and bodybuilder who was unfairly stereotyped as a 'bikie', his lawyer said</p>

<p>Footage showed Mr Kleinschafer get pepper sprayed from point blank range by an officer before he was pushed to the ground and place in a choke hold.</p>

<p>The same officer then handcuffed the diner and kneed him in the back of the head before dragging his face along the concrete ground. </p>

<p>While this was happening in full sight of restaurant-goers, his best friend Mr Sarkans was also kneed in the back of the head by two officers after being pepper-sprayed.</p>

<p>Mr Kleinschafer had to take eight months of work following the ugly incident. </p>

<p>Prosecutors dropped the charges against the men after police insisted for nine months they were attacked. </p>

<p>The men's lawyer Campbell MacCallum, of Moloney MacCallum Abdelshahied Lawyers, said they were incorrectly stereotyped as 'bikes' despite, despite having no connection to motorcycle gangs.</p>

<p>Peter James Kleinschafer is pictured after being pushed to the ground and pepper sprayed</p>

<p>He said police had told the pair to leave the restaurant but the men were asking what would happen to their half-eaten meals.</p>

<p>'All I can gather is one of the police officers has had a rush of blood, sprayed one of the persons and then the second police officer has sprayed the second person,' Mr MacCallum told the Gold Coast Bulletin. </p>

<p>Mr MacCallum told Nine News: 'I think the behaviour from the police on this occasion was disgraceful. </p>

<p>'It’s a matter of police justifying what they have done by charging these two particular people.' </p>

<p>Mr Sarkans, who is a model and bodybuilder, took to his Instagram page to reflect on the incident.</p>

<p>'Police brutality is becoming a routine now in Australia and yes people you need to fight back,' he wrote.</p>

<p>An officer has the Mr Kleinschafer is handcuffs before kneeing him in the head</p>

<p>'Not a statement that all police officers are the same, [but] too many of them are just not suitable to do their actual job.</p>

<p>'Too much enforcing not enough policing.' </p>

<p>Gold Coast Police Superintendent Mark Wheeler said a second review of the case had been ordered in the wake of the new video.</p>

<p>'Police are reviewing the incident and will take appropriate action,' he said.</p>

<p>'Generally, when a charge is withdrawn we have a prosecution review process to establish if there was any error made, any error in law or any other issue like an excessive use of force.'</p>

<p>The charge of urinating in public levelled at Mr Sarkans is also expected to be dropped by Queensland police.</p>
