<p>Standing tall: Ashley Banjo will make a defiant return to the Britain's Got Talent stage on Friday after a week of controversy surrounding his Black Lives Matter inspired dance with Diversity</p>

<p>Ashley cut a dapper figure in a dark print and a monochrome graphic print T-shirt as he happily joined judges Alesha, David Walliams and Amanda Holden to film the show - which will be aired on Saturday.</p>

<p>The star appeared in a chipper mood despite the drama surrounding his performance last week, which became the second most complained about TV moment of the decade.</p>

<p>Also present was Alesha, who gave her support to the group and hit back at a troll, telling them to 'kiss my black a**' on Thursday night.</p>

<p>The former MisTeeq singer didn't appear to let the furore phase her as she stunned in a hot pink number. </p>

<p>Back: The choreographer, 31, joined his fellow judges in the pre-recorded second semi final show - including Alesha Dixon, 41, who publicly supported him amid the backlash</p>

<p>Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show on Saturday night due to its overtly political stance. </p>

<p>An Ofcom spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline on Friday afternoon that Britain's Got Talent has received 15,500 complaints so far. On Monday the figure stood at 1,121. </p>

<p>They added: 'We are assessing the complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.'  </p>

<p>Proud: Also present was Alesha, who gave her support to the group and hit back at a troll, telling them to 'kiss my black a**' on Thursday night</p>

<p>Looking good: The former MisTeeq singer didn't appear to let the furore phase her as she stunned in a hot pink number</p>

<p>The new figures come after Alesha told critics to 'kiss my black a**' as she threw her support behind Ashley after he shared a post on Instagram from a critic telling him to keep politics out of entertainment.</p>

<p>Alesha commented under an Instagram post from a disgruntled social media user, who said: 'We the Great British Public will only support you if you entertain us and do not say anything about racism.'</p>

<p>The comment referred to the BLM-inspired dance which has sparked more than 15,000 complaints to media watchdog Ofcom when it was performed on Britain's Got Talent on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Update: Britain's Got Talent Ofcom complaints have soared again to 15,500 as dance troupe Diversity's Black Lives Matter performance continues to divide viewers </p>

<p>Powerful: Diversity's routine, which narrated the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd in May, had already polarised fans of the mainstream talent show on Saturday night</p>

<p>Critics claimed the dance, which was a 'take on the unprecedented events of 2020', had politicised the entertainment show, with one Twitter user insisting 'they are a dance group not a political movement.' </p>

<p>The full post - which also referred to boxer Anthony Joshua and F1 champion Lewis Hamilton - read: 'Dear Joshua, Hamilton, Banjo and any other black public figures.  </p>

<p>'We the Great British Public will only support you if you entertain us and do not say anything about racism. Thank you for your understanding.'  </p>

<p>Support: Alesha waded into the ongoing row about the politicisation of the ITV1 talent series as Banjo shared a post on Instagram from a critic telling him to keep politics out of entertainment </p>

<p>How about that: The new figure comes after Alesha told critics to 'kiss my black a**' as she threw her support behind Ashley</p>

<p>Ashley shared a screenshot of a message written by a critic to his Instagram, and said in the caption: '1. You do not represent or speak for the Great British public. </p>

<p>'2. Silence was never and will never be an option. 3. Change is inevitable... Get used to it.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a new batch of semi-final hopefuls graced the stage once more in their bid to make it to the grand final.</p>
