<p>And Megan Thee Stallion was feeling more than confident ahead of the festivities on Sunday, when she uploaded some incredibly revealing selfies in a teeny orange string bikini to her Instagram.</p>

<p>Baby got back: Megan Thee Stallion was feeling confident ahead of the VMAs on Sunday, when she uploaded some incredibly revealing selfies in a teeny orange string bikini to her Instagram</p>

<p>The Texas-born rapper, 25, had her outfit coordinated down to her hat and manicure, but the main focus of attention was of course her ample derriere in the duo of selfies she posted.</p>

<p>In addition to her scanty bikini, Megan accessorized with a matching yellow-orange Von Dutch trucker hat, featuring a camouflage pattern.</p>

<p>The green of her hat was picked up in her sharp green manicure. </p>

<p>What's more: The WAP superstar also shared a video of herself seated at her computer in the same outfit, throwing down an impressive freestyle rap to a beat track she was playing</p>

<p>Other than that, the Savage star had her hair in a long braid that teased her backside.</p>

<p>Her only other accessory was a pair of large silver hoop earrings.</p>

<p>Megan's rap, true to form, was explicit enough to be impossible to transcribe, but it pulsated with the same energy of some of her best hooks. </p>

<p>The hitmaker, born Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, posed in a nearly identical way just one week ago, in another string bikini and Von Dutch hat, only this time she was outdoors and holding a fishing rod.</p>

<p>MTS is nominated for at least five Video Music Awards this Sunday, including the coveted Artist Of The Year, Song Of The Year for Savage and Best Hip-Hop Video for the same.</p>

<p>She's also up twice for the Song of Summer Award, as featured artist on Cardi B's opus of raunch WAP as well as for her Savage remix featuring one Beyonce Knowles.</p>

<p>Toasting her success: Later, the rapper was seen celebrating as she took home the Best Hip-Hop Award at the 2020 MTV VMAs on Sunday</p>

<p>Other nominations this year were dominated by pop performers Lady Gaga and Ariana Grande, with nine nods each, while Billie Eilish and The Weeknd followed closely behind with six each. </p>

<p>Additional categories were unveiled last week, including Song of Summer, Best Group and Everyday Heroes: Frontline Medical Workers, with the latter created to ‘celebrate performances by Covid-19 first responders.’</p>

<p>Other new one-off award categories this year are for Quarantine Performance and Best Music Video from Home.</p>

<p>The first VMA ceremony was held in 1984 at New York City's Radio City Music Hall, where Madonna performed her hit Like a Virgin wearing her iconic wedding gown/bustier combination.</p>
