<p>The Anfield talisman had revealed his discontent with the lack of progress at Anfield in a press conference, and openly admitted to contemplating leaving his boyhood club.</p>

<p>Chelsea, bankrolled by Roman Abramovich and with newly-appointed Jose Mourinho at the helm, then fell short in a £20million move. Parry - who is now the chairman of the EFL - has relived the drama that unfolded.</p>

<p>Rick Parry (right) delved into Chelsea's failed move for Liverpool icon Steven Gerrard in 2004</p>

<p>The ex-Liverpool chief joked Roman Abramovich should have kept Gerrard on his lavish yacht</p>

<p>Boss Gerrard Houllier would soon step down after a trophyless season but Gerrard, just one year on from penning a four-year contract and being handed the captain's armband, still required a great deal of convincing. </p>

<p>The then 24-year-old spent time on holiday in Portugal after England's exit from Euro 2004 pondering over his options, while Chelsea continued with their full-scale charm offensive behind the scenes.</p>

<p>Rafa Benitez was installed as Houllier's successor and Parry was forced to immediately inform the new coach about the dilemma surrounding the club's key man. </p>

<p>Gerrard publicly admitted to considering his future at Liverpool after England's Euro 2004 exit</p>

<p>Chelsea owner Abramovich was keen to sign Gerrard to play under new boss Jose Mourinho</p>

<p>In a wide-ranging interview as part of the BBC's The 30-Year Wait programme, Parry said: 'Literally the first day that Rafa arrived, I had to tell him that Steven Gerrard had decided he wanted to go. </p>

<p>'I think during the Euros, Steven pretty much decided he wanted to go to Chelsea. The mistake Chelsea made was letting Steven come back to Liverpool after the Euros. </p>

<p>'They should have kept him on Abramovich’s boat.'</p>

<p>After four days of indecision Gerrard return back to Merseyside to hold showdown talks with Parry. </p>

<p>But the Liverpool talisman eventually rejected Chelsea's approach and chose to stay at Anfield</p>

<p>The day later, the duo held a press conference to confirm the midfielder would be staying. </p>

<p>Chelsea chief Peter Kenyon is believed to have stressed at the time that it had been in the interest of all parties to haul the deal over the line quickly, but the player refused to accept the move away and admitted 'temptation entered my life'.</p>

<p>A year later, Gerrard handed in a formal transfer request. The shock move came just six weeks after the superstar led Liverpool to their Champions League triumph in Istanbul.</p>

<p>Gerrard made another U-turn, however, and once again pledged his future to Anfield just hours after the bombshell.</p>
