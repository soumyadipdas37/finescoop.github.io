<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal have been set a Friday deadline to complete the signing of Houssem Aouar by Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas. </p>

<p>The Gunners are determined to sign the 22-year-old this summer and are set to raise their dismissed £32million offer to £36.5m with a further £9m in bonuses in a hope to secure the creative midfielder, according to football.london. </p>

<p>Aulas is also braced for late bids for forwards Moussa Dembele and Memphis Depay.</p>

<p>Arsenal are preparing a significantly improved second bid for target Houssem Aouar</p>

<p>He told footmercato.net: 'I'm thinking of proposing it tomorrow (Tuesday) to Rudi (Garcia) and Juninho, sporting director), because it's understandable.</p>

<p>'As of Friday, players who have not left will not leave. We don't need to sell and, for me, it's very easy to say that. </p>

<p>'After that, we can find agreements with players and clubs for a year to come.'  </p>

<p>Aouar, who has made 130 appearances for Lyon, is paramount to Mikel Arteta's plans as he looks to deploy his team in a 4-3-3 formation this season.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old attacking midfielder will be vital to Mikel Arteta's 4-3-3 formation this season</p>

<p>Despite rejecting their opening offer, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas suggested that the club would be open to selling Aouar for the right price.</p>

<p>He tweeted: 'For Houssem Arsenal is too far from his value: we are counting on him to play a great match in Lorient and lead OL in CL next year.'</p>

<p>Aouar has been previously valued at £54m but it is believed the Ligue 1 side will lower their asking price amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Aouar is reportedly keen to depart the Ligue 1 club before the end of the transfer window, meaning any deal must be completed before the deadline on October 5.  </p>

<p>Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas wants any deals to be completed by Friday </p>
