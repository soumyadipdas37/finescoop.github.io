<p>Here we go: New Strictly Come Dancing star Max George has waste no time in getting himself fit and ready for the ballroom floor ahead of the season launch in September</p>

<p>Revealing a toned and muscular physique, Max looked focused while working on his core strength with a series of upper body exercises, among them chest presses, press ups and resistance band reps. </p>

<p>In a final shot Max appears to be completely exhausted as he takes a well earned breather after the workout at Sam Witter's personal fitness studio in Manchester's Salford Quays. </p>

<p>Referencing his intense workout, he captioned the snaps: Big session tonight  <?php echo e('@'); ?>swh_gym. The last picture says it all.'</p>

<p>Getting stuck in: Taking to Instagram on Monday evening, The Wanted star, 32, shared images of his gruelling workout regime as he put in the hard yards during a recent gym session </p>

<p>Max will be hoping his hard work doesn't go to waste when he makes his Strictly bow with a yet to be announced professional dance partner. </p>

<p>Confirming his involvement on BBC's The One Show, the singer admitted he has already spoke to former bandmate Jay McGuinness, who won Strictly's coveted Glitter Ball in 2015. </p>

<p>'I spoke to Jay earlier, he left me a couple of voice notes,' Max explained, as host Alex Jones asked how he thinks he'll measure up to his old friend.</p>

<p>One more rep! The strain was starting to show as Max burned the calories away on a rowing machine</p>

<p>No pain no gain: Max looked focused while working on his core strength with a series of upper body exercises, among them press ups</p>

<p>'Oh no chance, there’s no comparison, but he might be able to mentor me maybe through Zoom, he may be able to help me out. He did say he can imagine me like a little schoolboy, nervous,' he replied.</p>

<p>Max rose to fame in 2009 with the group - completed by Siva Kaneswaran, Tom Parker and Nathan Sykes - known best for hit song All Time Low.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Max is a great signing and bosses hope he’ll help bring in a younger audience to the show as he was part of a really popular boyband.</p>

<p>'It’s great for the show to have a hunk already secured to take part and given his time singing they’re hoping he has good dancing feet.' </p>

<p>Finished: In a final shot Max appears to be completely exhausted as he takes a well earned breather after the workout at Sam Witter's personal fitness studio in Manchester</p>
