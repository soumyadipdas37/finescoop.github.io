<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wife of a property developer says she will stand by her husband's side after he was jailed for five years for trying to smuggle 300 kilograms of cocaine into Australia.  </p>

<p>Kelsea Nagel Doyle sat in the New South Wales District Court while her partner Matthew, 32, was sentenced on Friday. </p>

<p>Doyle and his private school mates Jared Hart, 31, and Raoul Kesby, 29, had planned to bring $80 million worth of cocaine from overseas before they were caught in September 2019, Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>Doyle, a property developer who had bought real estate in Cronulla, Caringbah South and Wollongong, had boasted about his love for money and put up $500,000 in advance for the cocaine.</p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug and received a 25 per cent reduction on his jail term.</p>

<p>While he serves a minimum of five years in jail, Mrs Doyle says she will raise their child and support her husband from their luxury $2million Burraneer home, in southern Sydney. </p>

<p>While he serves a minimum of five years in jail, Mrs Doyle (pictured) says she will raise their child and support her husband from their luxury $2million Burraneer home, in southern Sydney</p>

<p>'It's been an extremely tough 12 months for our family. I'm just thankful it's now over,' Mrs Doyle said.</p>

<p>'I would love to be left in peace to get on with looking after my child and supporting my husband and I would appreciate the media would finally give me some privacy.'</p>

<p>Undercover police had been posing as drug dealers while Doyle and his accomplices attempted to smuggle in the cocaine.  </p>

<p>Detectives had recorded conversations with Doyle since April 2019. </p>

<p>In one recording, Doyle boasted about selling 50 kilograms of cocaine a week.</p>

<p>In another, he claimed he 'was not a gangster but a businessman and loved money and loved making money for people and making friends'. </p>

<p>Police set up the trio when Doyle, Hart and Kesby tried to pick up 50 kilograms of a cocaine shipment from a Marrickville store unit, in Sydney's inner west, on September 4, 2019.  </p>

<p>Throughout Doyle's trial, defence barrister Philip Boulton QC argued Doyle would have not been involved in the plot to import drugs into the country if he was not approached during the police sting. </p>

<p>He also told the court the cocaine never existed. </p>

<p>'This is not a standard police entrapment case … there was never any drugs, he was never going to effect an importation, he was never going to obtain possession of drugs,' Mr Boulton said. </p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Emma Blizard accepted the drugs never existed but claimed Doyle wanted to be a part of the plot so he could make a lot of money (pictured, Matthew Doyle with his wife Kelsea) </p>

<p>Crown prosecutor Emma Blizard accepted the drugs never existed but claimed Doyle wanted to be a part of the plot so he could make a lot of money. </p>

<p>'He saw an opportunity that presented itself and his greed took over — that is why he became involved in this offending behaviour,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Blizard said Doyle's actions over several months, including handing over $500,000 in cash, proved he wanted the plot to import drugs to be a success. </p>

<p>Mr Boulton said that Doyle was aware that his life has been 'wrong' and he is trying to better himself. </p>

<p>'He knows that he has caused a lot of harm, he is doing what he can to make amends for his past and I would ask your honour to accept that his arrest has led to a readjustment of thinking,' Mr Boulton told Judge Penelope Hock. </p>

<p>Hart pleaded guilty to his involvement in supplying 50kg of the illicit substance and Kesby pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of illegal drugs. </p>
