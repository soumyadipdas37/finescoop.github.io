<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Los Angeles-based teenager is going viral for sharing the morally questionable trick that gets him free food from restaurants every single day.</p>

<p>Noah Wille, 19, shared his 'life hack that is also kind of terrible' on TikTok on August 28, and the video has racked up nearly a million views so far.</p>

<p>In the clip, Noah explains how he used a fake email address, a spreadsheet, and quite a bit of research to get birthday freebies from a different restaurant for all 365 days of the year.</p>

<p>Cheating the system: Noah Wille, 19, shared his 'life hack that is also kind of terrible' on TikTok on August 28, and the video has racked up nearly a million views so far</p>

<p>'I get free food or dessert from a restaurant every single day,' he says in the video.</p>

<p>'Once upon a time, I made this fake email account that I still use,' he explains.</p>

<p>'I made this fake email and I found a list of a bunch of restaurants that offered birthday freebies.</p>

<p>'So I put them all in here,' he adds, showing a spreadsheet, 'and I put my birthday on each website for a different day of the year. So I have 365 days of free food.'</p>

<p>The spreadsheet shows all of the food chains that he gets birthday freebies at, including Applebee's, Arby's, Auntie Anne's, Baskin Robbins, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Buca di Beppo, Caribou Coffee, Dairy Queen, Denny's, Dippin' Dots, Dunkin, Einstein Bros., Fudruckers, IHOP, Jack in the Box, Jamba Juice, Johnny Rocket's, and Krispy Kreme.</p>

<p>Also on his list are Macaroni Grill, Maggianos, Melting Pot, Moe's Southwestern Grill, Olive Garden, and On the Border.</p>

<p>Sneaky: He signed up for birthday freebies from lots of different restaurants, giving a different date of birth to each</p>

<p>While the list is in alphabetical order, though, it is only shown through February and the letter O. It's unclear if Noah actually found 365 different restaurants, or if he repeats restaurants and uses additional fake email addresses.     </p>

<p>'Tomorrow I have a free meal from Benihana's,' he adds in the video — though he has Benhiana's listed for a January date in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>'I really hope I'm not the only person who is crazy enough to do this,' he says.</p>

<p>Speaking to Buzzfeed, Noah said he is has been 'lacking food security' since moving to Los Angeles without the support of his parents — and compares his situation to homelessness.  </p>

<p>On his own: Noah said he is has been 'lacking food security' since moving to Los Angeles without the support of his parents — and compares his situation to homelessness</p>

<p>The teen, who appears to be pursuing a career as a social media content creator, said he needed to find a way to get food 'without plunging [himself] into even more debt.' </p>

<p>'So one day, I woke up and the birthday scheme popped into my head. In total, I would say the spreadsheet took me about three weeks to make and sign up for everything, but in the end, the effort has been totally worth it,' he added.</p>

<p>In a series of follow-up videos, Noah said that he is 'on food stamps,' is short on rent, and also has student loans. </p>
