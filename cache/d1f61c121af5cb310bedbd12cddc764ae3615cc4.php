<p>Playful: Rebecca Judd has revealed why she calls her former AFL footy star Chris Judd by the playful nickname 'Juddy'. Speaking on her 3PM Pick-Up on Tuesday, the 37-year-old model and TV presenter said she thought 'Chris' was just too formal for him </p>

<p>'We walk down the street and people are like "Hey Judd, Judd, Judd, can I get a photo Judd?" His name is Chris, it's so weird,' she added. </p>

<p>Bec was then pulled-up by co-host Monty, who reminded the mother-of-four that she herself calls Chris Judd, 'Juddy' as a nickname.</p>

<p>'I never did when he played footy,' Bec insisted. </p>

<p>'But now that he is not a footy player anymore, I call him Juddy,' she added. </p>

<p>Bec said she thought his first name sounds so 'formal', which is why she chose not to use it. </p>

<p>Too formal: Bec said she thought his first name sounds so 'formal', which is why she chose not to use it </p>

<p>'Chris sounds so formal,' she exclaimed. 'He turns as soon as I say Juddy.' </p>

<p>Bec finished by admitting she was probably one of the few people who ever called him 'Chris' in his personal life.   </p>

<p>Rebecca and Chris have been married for 10 years and share four young children together. </p>

<p>The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins, Tom and Darcy, both aged three.   </p>

<p>Earlier this year, Bec revealed that she and Chris split early in their relationship. </p>

<p>'When [Chris] Juddy and I were first hooking up when we were, I think about 19. We had only been hooking up for a little bit.  </p>

<p> All together:  The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins, Tom and Darcy, both aged three</p>

<p>'He had this event to go to and I wasn't really expecting to be invited to that event because we'd only just got together. But I wasn't expecting him to invite his ex-girlfriend instead of me!' </p>

<p>According to Bec, she was so 'heartbroken' she almost broke up with him at the time.</p>

<p>'It totally set us back I reckon another five or six months. So him and I were on-and-off for 18 months because none of us could actually tell each other what we were really thinking, even though we were mad for each other,' she revealed.</p>
