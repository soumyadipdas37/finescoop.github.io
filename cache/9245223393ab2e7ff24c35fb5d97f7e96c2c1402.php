<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham manager David Moyes will prioritise funds from the sale of Grady Diangana to strengthen his defence.</p>

<p>Moyes had hoped to keep Diangana but reluctantly agreed to the 22-year-old's £20m sale to West Brom as he needs the proceeds to be able move in the transfer market.</p>

<p>West Ham have been looking to offload a number of their squad but offers are understood to have been sparse so far.</p>

<p>David Moyes will use the sale of Grady Diangana to bolster his defensive options this summer </p>

<p>Diangana will have a medical with the Midlands club on Friday ahead of a £20million transfer</p>

<p>Moyes has been credited with interest in Brentford's Said Benrahma but the Scot believes he has enough forwards for now and that any money would be better allocated on bringing in defenders first.</p>

<p>Moyes, who is also desperate to hang on to Chelsea target Declan Rice, wants to add full-backs and a new centre-back with pace.</p>

<p>He is sifting through a number of targets but wants to ensure he brings in the right characters going forward after developing a good rapport among the current squad.</p>

<p>Diangana went out on loan to West Brom last season and helped them reach the top-flight</p>

<p>Diangana, who impressed on loan at West Brom last season, would have been given a chance at the London Stadium but the Baggies' offer was too good to turn down.</p>

<p>The Hawthorns club are looking to give Slaven Bilic some pace in attack and hope to conclude Diangana's deal on Friday after his medical. </p>

<p>They are also looking to make Callum Robinson's loan move from Sheffield United permanent in a deal that will see Scotland winger Oliver Burke go the other way to Bramall Lane.</p>
