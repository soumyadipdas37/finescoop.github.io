<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cat Deeley has confirmed the SM:TV Live reunion show has been filmed - and teased an air date.</p>

<p>The presenter, 43, told The Chris Moyles Show on Radio X on Wednesday that the former Saturday morning series - which helped make stars of her and Ant &amp; Dec - will be looked back on in a special documentary, to be aired at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'I can confirm… yes.' Cat teases, when asked about it by Chris on the air. 'We have filmed a documentary, it’s going to be aired at the end of the year.</p>

<p>'We went back to the studio where we did it. They rebuilt the set. We all cried.'</p>

<p>She went on: 'I walked in and [Ant &amp; Dec] were doing their interview and Dec was crying and I was like “ok you’re crying!” and then at the end of my interview I was like [sobs] “waaah!”</p>

<p>'We all have a bit of a cry, we take the mickey out of each other, it’s very, very, very cute.'</p>

<p>She revealed that Ant &amp; Dec have seen the show already, continuing: 'I actually got a text message from Ant yesterday saying he’s seen the first cut and they cried watching it too.'</p>

<p>Coming soon: Cat Deeley has confirmed the SM:TV Live reunion with Ant &amp; Dec will air at the end of the year</p>

<p>Cat admitted she cringes when she watches the earlier episodes, saying: 'Hopefully there wasn’t too much of the first show in it otherwise he would be crying at how appallingly bad we were, we were rubbish!'</p>

<p>Cat also appeared on Heart Breakfast and spoke about SM:TV some more.</p>

<p>'We did talk about it and go "could we do it again? Could we, would we, should we?"' she said.</p>

<p>Host Amanda Holden's response to this was: 'Oh I say yes! Oh yes! Oh it was hilarious! I’d come back, I’d definitely watch it!'</p>

<p>Co-host Jamie Theakston - who presented rival CBBC show Live &amp; Kicking - mused: 'Saturday morning TV was some of the best fun we ever had, wasn’t it?'</p>

<p>To which Cat agreed: 'It’s just one of those things where you turn around and you go there’s nothing like it. You can’t get away with that kind of stuff anymore.</p>

<p>'I mean, literally, we were texting yesterday with Ant, and we used to do a sketch called Fart Attack that was based on Neil Buchanan and Ant played him, and I was like "did you know by the way that Neil Buchanan was supposed to be Banksy?" And I went "Jeez, are you Banksy?! Are you Banksy?"</p>

<p>'We were laughing – wouldn’t that be a great sketch now? That was the thing, you could be so… it was definitely of the moment because it was live every week.'</p>

<p>Baby faced: SMTV Live ran for more than 270 episodes from 1998 to 2003 with Ant and Dec at the helm for the first three years (trio pictured in 1998)</p>

<p>An insider told The Sun in July: 'SM:TV was such a huge part of Ant and Dec's career they knew they wanted to mark it in some way.</p>

<p>'The show will look back on some of the best moments and see old guests reminisce.'</p>

<p>SM:TV Live ran for more than 270 episodes from 1998 to 2003 with Ant and Dec at the helm for the first three years. </p>
