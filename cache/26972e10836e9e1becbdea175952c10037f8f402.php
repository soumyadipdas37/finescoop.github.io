<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Melting icecaps. Raging fires. Political unrest. And a mysterious flu-like virus that threatens to ravage humanity. </p>

<p>No, this isn't just another day in 2020. It's the world of Utopia, a British fantasy sci-fi thriller that first aired on Channel 4 seven years ago, in which a cult comic book predicts real-life disasters – some eerily familiar. </p>

<p>Now the show has been relocated to America for a remake on Amazon Prime.</p>

<p>It couldn't begin more innocently. Under clear blue skies in suburbia, a wholesome young couple excitedly move into a house left to the woman by her late grandfather.</p>

<p>The house is full of clutter, and among it they find the drafts for an unpublished comic book, Utopia, which they decide to sell at comic book festival Fringecom.</p>

<p>But here the eight-part tale takes a dark turn. Utopia isn't just a comic: it's the eagerly awaited sequel to Dystopia, a graphic horror novel about a world turned into chaos by supervillain Mr Rabbit. </p>

<p>Among the usual comic book obsessives at Fringecom are four young people who see Dystopia as a grim warning for the future. </p>

<p>They believe Utopia, if they can find it, is the guide map to salvation. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, two strangers who will stop at nothing to obtain Utopia for their own sinister purposes arrive at Fringecom too...</p>

<p>'I love the world of comic books,' says Gillian Flynn, the author of 2012 bestseller Gone Girl who has loosely adapted the new series from the original. </p>

<p>Dr Christie, played by John Cusack (pictured centre), is loosely based on sinister versions of the Elon Musks and Bill Gates of this world</p>

<p>'My dad collected them. We'd drive around garage sales and flea markets for them, so I've always had that fire.'</p>

<p>The original Utopia, created by Dennis Kelly, whose new show The Third Day is now on Sky Atlantic, was a cult phenomenon, admired for its smart storytelling yet condemned for sometimes excessive violence. </p>

<p>Due to budget issues, the American version has taken seven years to come to screens, after being dropped by HBO and Fight Club's David Fincher leaving as director.</p>

<p>In an eerie twist, one prophecy of Dystopia – a deadly pandemic – has gone from fantasy to grim reality just as the new show comes out. </p>

<p>'When we were trying to sell it, the concern was that this part isn't believable,' says Gillian. </p>

<p>'People were saying, "These things aren't happening, it's a chance in a million." </p>

<p>Rainn Wilson as Michael Stearns, a leading expert on a deadly flu</p>

<p>'So of all the moments to have it happen. We'd just finished filming in late February and I was editing it when these notices started coming up on TV. It's very strange.'</p>

<p>Gillian actually started writing her version while the British one was still airing. </p>

<p>'We were filming Gone Girl,' she says of the movie of her psychological thriller starring Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike, which was directed by David Fincher. </p>

<p>'David sent me a text saying, "I think we've got our next project – call me."</p>

<p>'I hadn't seen the show, but then I watched it. Dennis had created such an amazing world that I thought, "Will there be anything new to say about this?" </p>

<p>'But when I looked at it all through my own lens I did find a story to write.'</p>

<p>The first change Gillian made was altering the look from Dennis's stylised, slightly tongue-in-cheek visuals to make it grittier and more realistic. </p>

<p>'He had this chirpy Britpop sensibility that we Americans could not pull off if we tried – lots of bright colours and more explosive violence. </p>

<p>'My goal was to give it almost a lack of style. I wanted this world to feel real. I felt the more we could tamp it down into the real world, the scarier it would be.'</p>

<p>She also toned down the violence. 'There are moments here and there, certainly at the start as I wanted to establish that this is a dangerous world. </p>

<p>'But there's much more implied violence. I find that scarier – to me, it's scarier when you can't see the shark in Jaws than when you can.'</p>

<p>One element she did keep was the show's distinctive dark humour that, in true British style, underlies some of its bleakest moments. </p>

<p>'I didn't particularly use British or American humour, I used what would make me laugh. </p>

<p>'The actors are very funny, and it was a treat to see them breathe life into the words – until then it had been my husband and me on the couch reading aloud and they weren't funny at all!'</p>

<p>The new trailer follows a similar plot line to the original series, starting with a group of geeks meeting at a comic book convention. Pictured, Jessica Rothe as Samantha </p>

<p>Relative unknowns Dan Byrd, Jessica Rothe, Ashleigh LaThrop and Desmin Borges play the young crusaders Ian, Samantha, Becky and Wilson, respectively. </p>

<p>John Cusack, the star of Grosse Pointe Blank, plays Dr Kevin Christie, an entrepreneur and philanthropist. </p>

<p>'He's one of those mega-billionaires with foundations,' says John, 54. 'He's very powerful and committed to staving off the extinction of the planet.'</p>

<p>But Dr Christie – loosely based on sinister versions of the Elon Musks and Bill Gates of this world – may not be so virtuous. </p>

<p>'We are critical of the notion of benevolent billionaires – when you look behind the curtains, maybe they're not as benevolent as they seem.'</p>

<p>John has not seen the British series. 'I didn't want to think about it while we made our show. But I hear people love it – and it's controversial. </p>

<p>'I'm not surprised, Gillian doesn't shy away from stuff.' </p>

<p>Utopia will be on Amazon Prime from Friday.</p>
