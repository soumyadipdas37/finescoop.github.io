<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>England laboured in Reykjavik but sealed a hard-fought 1-0 victory over Iceland in the Nations League thanks to Raheem Sterling's late penalty. </p>

<p>Gareth Southgate's side were reduced to 10 men in the second half as Kyle Walker was dismissed for a second bookable offence, and Sverrir Ignason was also given his marching orders after handling the ball as referee Srdjan Jovanovic awarded a penalty. </p>

<p>Raheem Sterling held his nerve from the spot but England conceded a stoppage time penalty when Joe Gomez hauled down his opponent, only for former Aston Villa man Birkir Bjarnason to blaze his spot kick over the bar.</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling showed composure to score a late penalty in England's win over Iceland</p>

<p>PLAYER RATINGS </p>

<p>ICELAND (4-5-1) </p>

<p>Halldorsson 7; Hermannsson 6, Arnason 7, Ingason 6, Magnusson 6; Palsson 7 Traustason 6 (Hallfredsson 76), Bjarnason 5; Bodvarsson 6, Thorsteinsson 5 (Sigurdsson 66); Gudmundsson 6.</p>

<p>ENGLAND (4-3-3)  </p>

<p>Gareth Southgate 6</p>

<p>Swapped the waistcoat for a round neck jumper and might have wished he had changed tactics too as his far from fully fit team lacked an attacking edge and invention</p>

<p>Gareth Southgate should have moved more quickly to change a team lacking in invention</p>

<p>Jordan Pickford 6</p>

<p>Not a lot to do, but did nothing wrong considering the pressure to keep his place in the side.</p>

<p>Kyle Walker 5</p>

<p>Had to perform on his 49th appearance with Trent Alexander-Arnold on the bench and has now lost his place after being sent off for two bookable offences. Could be a long wait until he hits 50 caps.</p>

<p>Joe Gomez 5</p>

<p>Impressive passing from at times and made a telling block to stopped a possible early home goal with poor judgement for Iceland’s penalty.</p>

<p>Eric Dier 6</p>

<p>Strong in the air, but hardly involved until he carelessly gave the ball away to spark Iceland's first dangerous attack, which ended in a free-kick</p>

<p>Kieran Trippier 6</p>

<p>Not everyone's first choice for left-back and did not help himself with some wayward passing.</p>

<p>James Ward-Prowse 6</p>

<p>Not the biggest name in this England line-up but did not look out of place on his senior debut.</p>

<p>Declan Rice 7</p>

<p>Recovered from a shaky start to play well, but missed a great opportunity to score in first half.</p>

<p>Phil Foden 6</p>

<p>Nothing spectacular, but surely the start of a long England career. Linked up well with Man City team-mate Raheem Sterling.</p>

<p>Raheem Sterling 7</p>

<p>Kept his cool to win the match form the penalty spot. Started well and a regular threat cutting in from the wing, struggled to keep up the pace.</p>

<p>Harry Kane 6</p>

<p>Led by example and could have had two early goals – including one incorrectly disallowed for offside. No VAR here. Faded in second half and substituted.</p>

<p>Jadon Sancho 6</p>

<p>Started well on his full England debut, moved the ball quickly and with confidence, but did not make the most of his possession and was the fall guy after Walker's red card.</p>

<p>SUBS:</p>

<p>Danny Ings replaced Foden after 68 minutes.</p>

<p>Trent Alexander-Arnold replaced Jadon Sancho on 73 minutes as Southgate changed tactics following Walker's red card.</p>

<p>Mason Greenwood replaced Harry Kane for final 12 minutes.</p>

<p>REFEREE: Srdjan Jovanovic 5 - too many random decisions.</p>
