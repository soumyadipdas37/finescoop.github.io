<p>'Everyone kept reassuring me that babies adapt really quickly, and although for the first few days she was very unsettled, she's now back to her usually smiley self and she's even started to find her voice. </p>

<p>'I wanted to send a big thank you to everyone that shared their stories with me, it's made it all much easier to deal with as I had no idea this condition affected so many people.  </p>

<p>'I've found <?php echo e('@'); ?>stepscharityworldwide have got lots of useful information and also DDH UK have a great Facebook support group #hipdysplasiaawareness.' (sic) </p>

<p>According to the NHS website, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a condition where the 'ball and socket' joint of the hip does not properly form in babies and young children. </p>

<p>It's sometimes called congenital hip dislocation or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded, like a ball, and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket.</p>

<p>In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose.</p>

<p>Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) occurs when the ball and socket joint does not form properly in babies and young children.</p>

<p>The hip joint connects the thigh bone, or femur, to the pelvis. The top of the femur is ball shaped and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket.</p>

<p>In DDH, the hip socket is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place. This causes the hip joint to be loose. In severe cases, it can dislocate.</p>

<p>DDH can affect one or both hips. It is more common in the left hip, as well as in girls and firstborn children.</p>

<p>One or two in every 1,000 babies have DDH that requires treatment.</p>

<p>This may include a fabric splint, called a Pavlik harness, which secures the hips in a stable position so they can grow normally.</p>

<p>If this does not work, or the child is over six months at the time of diagnosis, surgery may be required to place the ball of the femur in the hip socket. </p>

<p>Left untreated, DDH can cause patients to develop a limp, hip pain or oestoarthritis. </p>
