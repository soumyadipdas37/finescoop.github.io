<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mexico National Guard troops confiscated a deadly cartel's homemade tank which was equipped to withstand bullets and shrapnel.  </p>

<p>The shocking discovery took place last week while servicemen were conducting a surveillance operation in Apatzingán, a municipality in the western state of Michoacán.</p>

<p>Photos tweeted by the National Guard last Friday showed how the heavily armored vehicle was built out of scrap metal armor panels which were attached to a full size pickup vehicle. </p>

<p>Members of Mexico's National Guard investigate a pickup truck that was converted into a homemade war tank and abandoned in the western state of Michoacán</p>

<p>The souped-up vehicle was fortified with multiple sheets of steel that protected it from bullets and shrapnel</p>

<p>The homemade war tank was fortified with multiple sheets of steel which towered over the vehicle and protected the side and rear areas from attacks. </p>

<p>The pickup truck's front windshield was completely covered, except for a small area which provided the driver of the massive vehicle enough space to see through. </p>

<p>Slightly above the front passenger side of the tank was a metal mount where the cartel members could rest their rifles. </p>

<p>Mexico's National Guard found a homemade tank that had been reportedly abandoned by Los Viagras, a cartel that was born out of a self-defense group created in 2014</p>

<p>According to local media outlets, the souped-up vehicle was abandoned in the Apatzingán neighborhood of San José de Chila by Los Viagras, a criminal organization which formed in 2014 as a self-defense group. </p>

<p>The then-chief of the Michoacán state police approached Los Viagras in 2015 for help in taking down the leader of Los Caballeros Templarios cartel.  </p>

<p>But the gang quickly moved into the drug trade business themselves. </p>

<p>Today the group remains entangled in a war with the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Mexico's fastest growing criminal syndicate, over control of the Tierra Caliente region, which covers the states of Michoacán, Guerrero and State of Mexico.</p>
