<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea centre back Fikayo Tomori is reportedly on the verge of joining Everton as Carlo Ancelotti continues to add to his first-team squad this summer. </p>

<p>After signing Napoli midfielder Allan at the weekend for £22million, the Toffees brought in Real Madrid playmaker James Rodriguez on Monday. </p>

<p>Now it looks as though Ancelotti will add to his ranks defensively, with Chelsea keen for 22-year-old Tomori to gain some regular first-team football in the Premier League, and talks are at an advanced stage according to ESPN. </p>

<p>Chelsea defender Fikayo Tomori looks set to join Everton on a season-long loan deal this week</p>

<p>The 22-year-old featured regularly under Frank Lampard early on last season but lost his place </p>

<p>Tomori also played under Lampard at Derby but he now looks set to join ranks at Everton </p>

<p>The report details that Tomori also attracted interest from Rennes and Newcastle but a move to Goodison Park is the most likely scenario currently.  </p>

<p>Tomori first worked under Chelsea boss Frank Lampard at Derby County in the 2018-19 season and was a key player as the Rams reached the Championship play-off final. </p>

<p>Lampard played the young centre half early on last season and he scored memorable first goal for the club from 30-yards in a 5-2 win against Wolves at Molineux. </p>

<p>After being called up to the England squad in October, he made his senior debut for the national side against Kosovo last November. </p>

<p>But following the signing of a new five-year deal a month later, Tomori fell out of favour and after the three-month delay of the season due to the coronavirus pandemic, the 22-year-old did not play a single minute as Lampard's side finished in the top-four. </p>

<p>After a call-up in October, Tomori made his England debut against Kosovo in November 2019 </p>

<p>He ended up with 22 appearances in all competitions for the Blues last season.  </p>

<p>With ex-PSG captain Thiago Silva joining on a free transfer, competition for places are now high at Stamford Bridge and so Tomori looks likely to leave on loan next season.  </p>

<p>Antonio Rudiger, Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen are other senior centre backs currently in the Chelsea squad.  </p>
