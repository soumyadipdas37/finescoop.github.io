<p>Former Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale persistently pursued and kissed a woman in his mayoral chambers on two occasions at the Ipswich City Council in December 2016.</p>

<p>In 2017, police allegedly found a bag under Pisasale's desk which contained sexual aids such as condoms and Viagra when they raided his office, according to The Courier Mail.</p>

<p>The 69-year-old, who resigned as mayor later in 2017 and pleaded guilty to sexual assaulting a woman, corruption and drug possession in Ipswich District Court on Thursday. </p>

<p>Former Ipswich Mayor Paul Pisasale (pictured), 69, pleaded guilty to sexual assaulting a woman, official corruption and unlawful drug possession in Ipswich District Court on Thursday</p>

<p>'(The victim) described the impact of the power difference between him as lord mayor and herself... as making her really scared,' prosecutor Sarah Farnden said on Thursday.</p>

<p>'The offending of the defendant in all respects undermined the integrity of Ipswich City Council and the position of mayor.' </p>

<p>He also pleaded guilty in August to perjury and a $28,000 secret commission but a suppression order prevented media reporting it. This has now been lifted.</p>

<p>Pisasale read an apology to the court, saying he started out trying to help the 'beautiful people of Ipswich' but personal 'obsession and a lack of judgment' took over during a 'dark period of his life'.</p>

<p>'My mind and ego took over and my behaviour was out of control,' he told the packed courtroom.</p>

<p>'I am not a bad person but I have made some very bad decisions.'</p>

<p>Pisasale throws desiccated coconut on the world's largest lamington in 2009. Seven years later, he persistently pursued and kissed a woman in his mayoral chambers on two occasions at the Ipswich City Council in December 2016</p>

<p>Pisasale's mayoral office in Ipswich City Council (pictured) was raided by police in June 2017, prompting him to resign shortly after </p>

<p>The official corruption charge relates to Pisasale agreeing to champion a Yamanto real estate project while mayor by influencing council workers and contractors.</p>

<p>Ms Farnden said he was promised up to $35 million if sales went ahead as planned but he never received the money.</p>

<p>What he actually got was the services of escorts and two cash payments.</p>

<p>Pisasale was also convicted of disobedience to statute law and unlawful possessing Sildenafil, which is often sold under the brand name Viagra.</p>

<p>The perjury conviction followed a Crime and Corruption Commission investigation that started in October 2017.</p>

<p>Pisasale gave false testimony at a CCC hearing with regard to carrying packages from interstate for barrister Sam Di Carlo.</p>

<p>A raft of fraud charges relate to Ipswich City Council property and money.</p>

<p>Pisasale had his assistant deposit $26,000 in donations into a personal bank account instead of disbursing it to the intended beneficiaries.</p>

<p>He spent $4,322 of council money to travel to concerts in Sydney and Melbourne.</p>

<p>'Examples of blatantly misusing council funds,' Ms Farnden said</p>

<p>He also applied to his own use charity auction items, including sporting memorabilia, a barbecue, kitchen appliances, artwork, photographs, decorative items and whiskey.</p>

<p>The former mayor talks to a bilby at Queens Park nature reserve. In court on Thursday, he said: 'I am not a bad person but I have made some very bad decisions.'</p>

<p>But defence lawyer David Jones said Pisasale hadn't 'embarked on a campaign of personal enrichment'.</p>

<p>'These items weren't found decorating the walls at his home,' he said.</p>

<p>'On one occasion, he donated a China tea set and later bid for it to come back,' he said.</p>

<p>Other items were used as gifts during official council business.</p>

<p>But Ms Farnden said Pisasale's offending was 'pivotal' to the systemically corrupt culture at the council.</p>

<p>'This type of offending damages the fabric of the community,' she said.</p>

<p>'He did not act with the integrity expected of someone in his position and he did not need to be persuaded in order to participate,' he said.</p>

<p>Pisasale was a popular mayor credited with the 'renaissance' of Ipswich during his tenure as mayor from 2004 to 2017.</p>

<p>He resigned in June 2017 after 13 years in the position following a CCC raid at his office and home.</p>

<p>Pisasale was previously sentenced to two years' prison, suspended after 12 months, after he was convicted of extortion in 2019.</p>

<p>He remains in custody and is expected to be sentenced for all 35 charges next Wednesday.   </p>
