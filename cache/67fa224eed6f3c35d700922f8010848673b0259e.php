<p>And the 26-year-old blonde bombshell certainly turned plenty of heads during the opening of boyfriend Matt Poole's new restaurant, Maman Bar and Kitchen.</p>

<p>Tammy proved to be quite the scene-stealer as she gave a glimpse of her ample assets in a racy black dress with raunchy cut outs. </p>

<p>Racy: Tammy Hembrow, 26, (R) set pulses racing as she flaunted plenty of underboob in a black dress alongside boyfriend Matt Poole at the opening of his Gold Coast restaurant </p>

<p>The dress also flashed her toned midriff and navel, through a circular cut out around her stomach. </p>

<p>Tammy paired her eye-catching dress with a pair of pointed heels and a black handbag which she wore slung over her shoulders. </p>

<p>The Gold Coast beauty opted to wear her long, blonde tresses back in a ponytail. </p>

<p>Romantic: Matt held Tammy in close at the opening of his new restaurant Maman bar and kitchen, located in the Gold Coast's trendy Burleigh Heads</p>

<p>She finished her look with a glossy foundation, dark eye makeup, and a matte lipstick. </p>

<p>Matt showed off his equally impressive physique in a black shirt which he paired with matching black pants and white sneakers. </p>

<p>The athlete spoke about the new venture to the Courier Mail on Thursday: 'I'm coming towards the back end of my (ironman) career now,' he said. </p>

<p>High glam: The Gold Coast beauty opted to wear her long, blonde tresses back in a ponytail. She finished her look with a glossy foundation, dark eye makeup, and a matte lipstick</p>

<p>'I'm 32 and been racing professionally for 14 years – so I'm starting to look to transition into life after sport,' he added. </p>

<p>Matt admitted he is unlikely to be in the kitchen, with him looking to be 'at the front door' or 'behind the bar'. </p>

<p>The couple's display comes after Matt made his debut on Tammy's YouTube channel last month and answered a series of questions from her fans.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes: The couple showed themselves getting ready earlier in the night</p>

<p>The genetically blessed couple revealed who was the 'most dominant' in their relationship, and also who'd been the first to say 'I love you'.</p>

<p>'I think you're the dominant one,' Matt said. 'I go along and I go along, and then when you push me too far, I snap, and you go, "Oh, too far."'</p>

<p>'Yeah, I would agree,' Tammy responded. 'I just think I'm quite a dominant person.'  </p>

<p>'I did. I am obsessed,' Matt admitted, before Tammy explained how Matt had confessed his feelings after they'd 'had a little fight' on holiday in the Whitsundays in September. </p>

<p>'We had a little fight over nothing, and then when he was trying to make up with me and apologise, he told me he loved me,' the fitness mogul said with a smile.</p>
