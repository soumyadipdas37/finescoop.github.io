<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jack Wilshere is open to playing abroad as he tries to get his injury-ravaged career back on track following two frustrating years at West Ham.</p>

<p>The midfielder has played a mere 837 minutes in 19 games for the Hammers since arriving from Arsenal in 2018 with ankle and groin injuries taking a heavy toll.</p>

<p>Despite completing 90 minutes against Hull City in the Carabao Cup in midweek, after Josh Cullen tested positive for Covid-19, Hammers manager David Moyes has made clear Wilshere isn't part of his plans.</p>

<p>Jack Wilshere made a rare appearance for West Ham when they beat Hull in the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>The midfielder is open to a move abroad after David Moyes made clear he wasn't in his plans</p>

<p>But the 28-year-old, who had returned to full fitness before the pandemic struck in March, is open-minded about his next challenge.</p>

<p>'I just want to play games and get back to the level whether that's at West Ham or somewhere else, different country, a different culture maybe,' Wilshere told The Times.</p>

<p>'I still feel like I've got something to give whether that will be in England, in Italy, Spain or anywhere.</p>

<p>'I want to prove people wrong and most of all for myself to see if I can get myself to a high level again.</p>

<p>'I want to show people what I can do. Any footballer that says he's happy being on the bench is lying. I want to play.</p>

<p>Injury-prone Wilshere had recovered full fitness before lockdown ruined his chances of action</p>

<p>Wilshere's time at boyhood club West Ham has been disappointing with just 19 matches played</p>

<p>'I want to get a run of games, 15-20 games which I still think I can do and have an influence on games and get that confidence back.'</p>

<p>Wilshere has 34 caps for England and his last appearance was the humiliating Euro 2016 defeat to Iceland.</p>

<p>But the midfielder hasn't given up on resurrecting his international career.</p>

<p>'I'd like to still think the door would be open. England should be picked on form and players that are doing well,' Wilshere said.</p>

<p>'It's down to me to do well, get back playing first of all and then get a run of games and start doing well again. I do believe I can do that.'</p>
