<p>A father of five daughters, named only as Pannalal, allegedly slit open his pregnant wife's stomach to find out if she was bearing a son this time</p>

<p>His wife, believed to be around 35, was seven-months pregnant according to police.</p>

<p>She is in a serious condition in a Bareilly hospital. </p>

<p>The family of the victim alleged that Pannalal wanted a son as he already had five daughters.</p>

<p>They suspect he committed the crime to know if the baby was male or female according to The Hindustan Times. </p>

<p>In India, the preference of sons still remains strong, with boys adding to the family wealth, while daughters drain it with dowries. </p>

<p>According to Newsweek 'sex selective abortions are widespread in India' where families would prefer to have sons. </p>

<p>The husband carried out the attack in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, India (pictured) on September 19 and has been taken into custody</p>

<p>They said according to a 2007 report by the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) son preference in the county is a 'well-documented phenomenon'.</p>

<p>This has implications for skewed sex ratios, female feticide and higher mortality rates for girls. </p>
