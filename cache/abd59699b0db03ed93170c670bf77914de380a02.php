<p>The southern part of the walkway, which features views of Sydney's iconic Opera House and Harbour Bridge, is the most dilapidated, engineers claim. </p>

<p>An internal report from August last year featured pictures of the wooden piles, the concrete underside of the walkway and the seawall beneath, revealing how they have fallen into disrepair.</p>

<p>Secret images of Australia's world-famous Circular Quay promenade have exposed concerning deterioration lurking beneath the surface (Pictured: A wooden pile beneath the eastern concourse last year)</p>

<p>Engineers estimated that about a third of the southern promenade's 234 timber and steel piles were in a poor condition, the report, which was obtained by the Sydney Morning Herald under freedom of information, showed.</p>

<p>Fears were raised that there was cause for concern  as it was 'likely to worsen and may cause serious structural inadequacies in the future'.</p>

<p>Graeme Taylor, from community group Action for Public Transport, slammed the government for not doing enough to ensure the structures were safe. </p>

<p>'It's really in a serious state of disrepair. A much more proactive approach is needed to more seriously address the widespread deterioration.'</p>

<p>The government came under fire earlier this year when it was revealed Circular Quay's iconic wharves were also hiding concerning defects</p>

<p>A spokesman from NSW Transport said 'all necessary critical maintenance has been, and will continue to be, carried out'.</p>

<p>Six of 16 concrete support structures and 45 piles have been repaired or replaced over the past few months. </p>

<p>'The community may be assured that Transport for NSW undertakes regular and comprehensive inspections and maintenance,' he said.</p>

<p>The government came under fire earlier this year when it was revealed Circular Quay's iconic wharves were also hiding concerning defects. </p>

<p>The defects included broken chains, rotting timber and severely damaged supports, 9news reported. </p>

<p>The wharves heritage-listed, which means upgrades are restricted to repair and replacement work with the same or similar materials. </p>

<p>The government has planned to begin construction on both the aged Circular Quay ferry wharves and waterfront land in 2023 with the price sitting around $200 million.</p>

<p>The upgrade is much later than the original plans, which had the construction beginning last year. </p>
