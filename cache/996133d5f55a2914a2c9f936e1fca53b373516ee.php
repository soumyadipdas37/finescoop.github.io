<p>The host sampled jellyfish and chips after a segment on sustainable fishing, with experts suggesting jellyfish were a more environmentally friendly alternative to the usual fish and chips. </p>

<p>But while the 39-year-old was impressed by the benefits of the dish, which helps alleviate the pressure on endangered fish species, she found she could not quite stomach it. </p>

<p>Not swallowing that! Carrie Bickmore (pictured) was left gagging on an exotic dish during Tuesday's episode of The Project</p>

<p>Carrie showed off her meal, which featured seasoned strips of jellyfish and chips in a box. </p>

<p>She screwed up her nose and complained: 'To me, that's already making me feel queasy'. </p>

<p>Carrie took a mouthful, reacting very strongly, shaking as if she were about to have a seizure. </p>

<p>Good for the planet! The host sampled jellyfish and chips after a segment on sustainable fishing, with experts suggesting jellyfish were a more environmentally friendly alternative to the usual fish and chips</p>

<p>She screwed up her nose and complained: 'To me, that's already making me feel queasy'</p>

<p>'It's the sliminess!' she cried out, shaking her hands, 'It's the texture...! It's all those little slidy things.'</p>

<p>Her co-star Waleed Aly insisted it tasted alright to him, so she decided to give it another go, saying she didn't want to offend the chef who made it.  </p>

<p>'It's not good!' she mumbled, as the jellyfish strips dripped from her mouth, before she threw it back up into the container. </p>

<p>Oh dear: Carrie took a mouthful, reacting very strongly, shaking as if she were about to have a seizure. 'It's the sliminess!' she cried out, shaking her hands, 'It's the texture...! It's all those little slidy things' </p>

<p>Oh well she tried: 'It's not good!' she mumbled, as the jellyfish strips dripped from her mouth, before she threw it back up into the container</p>

<p>'Carrie!' Waleed chastised her, to which Carrie clarified: 'It's the texture. The flavour's beautiful.' </p>

<p>Guest host Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald tried the fried tempura version, and said it was 'horrible'. </p>

<p>Host Peter Helliar meanwhile described it was very salty, before joking, 'You can use the tentacles to floss afterwards, as well!' </p>

<p>Try again sometime! 'Carrie!' Waleed chastised her, to which Carrie clarified: 'It's the texture. The flavour's beautiful' </p>
