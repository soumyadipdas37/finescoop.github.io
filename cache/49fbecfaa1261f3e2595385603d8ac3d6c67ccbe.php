<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been hospitalised with 'the early stages of double pneumonia' after testing positive for coronavirus. </p>

<p>Double, or bilateral, pneumonia, which affects both lungs and can make breathing difficult, has been seen in many cases of patients hospitalised with COVID-19.</p>

<p>Berlusconi, 83, who has a history of heart and other medical problems, went to hospital in Milan 'as a precaution' on Thursday night, two days after testing positive for the coronavirus.</p>

<p>His condition is not serious, his Forza Italia party said on Friday. </p>

<p>Lucia Ronzulli told RAI state TV that the media mogul was doing well and was undergoing 'precautionary monitoring' of his infection.</p>

<p>Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi (pictured in 2016) went to hospital in Milan 'as a precaution' on Thursday night, two days after testing positive for the coronavirus</p>

<p>'He passed the night well,' she said.</p>

<p>State radio later said Mr Berlusconi had been admitted to San Raffaele hospital in Milan, where his private doctor is based, shortly after midnight.</p>

<p>Sky TG24, reporting from outside the hospital, said Mr Berlusconi had the 'beginnings of pneumonia' and was given an oxygen mask to aid breathing.</p>

<p>Italian media have stressed he is not in intensive care. Sky said he arrived by private car and walked into the hospital, where he had a CT scan shortly after arrival.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Mr Berlusconi, speaking in a strong but nasal voice from his estate on the outskirts of the city, told his supporters he no longer had fever or pain.</p>

<p>Italian media have said two of his adult children were recently diagnosed with Covid-19 and are self-isolating.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately this isn't a cold,' La Stampa newspaper reported him saying on Thursday. 'Now it touches me — but not only me, but also my family — I realise more than ever how grave' the pandemic is.</p>

<p>'I'm aware of how much sorrow it has sowed in so many families, of how much pain it has caused so many people. I think of all those who aren't here any more, I think of those who lost their loved ones,' he said.</p>

<p>He was further quoted as saying that earlier in the week, as well as fever, he had muscle and bone pain, 'but it passed'.</p>

<p>Italian media have stressed he is not in intensive care. Sky said he arrived by private car and walked into the hospital (pictured), where he had a CT scan shortly after arrival</p>

<p>In 1997, he was successfully treated for prostate cancer, including by surgery. In 2006, he had heart tests at San Raffaele after fainting during a speech. A few weeks later he was fitted with a pacemaker at a US hospital.</p>

<p>He also has had bowel surgery for an obstruction and suffered an inflammatory eye condition.</p>

<p>Mr Berlusconi spent some of his summer holiday at his seaside villa on Sardinia's Emerald Coast. Many of Italy's recent cases of Covid-19 have been linked to clusters in people who took holidays on Sardinia.</p>

<p>According to Italian media, at the urging of family members, he spent a few weeks at another one of his villas, in France, early in Italy's Covid-19 outbreak, which was particularly devastating in Lombardy, where Mr Berlusconi's home and business empire is based.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the three-time former premier vowed to keep campaigning in upcoming regional elections in Italy for the centre-right Forza Italia party that he created more than 25 years ago.</p>

<p>The party has steadily lost popularity with voters in recent years as Mr Berlusconi battled legal problems linked to his media business and his infamous 'bunga bunga parties'.</p>

<p>After being convicted of tax fraud in 2013, he had to surrender his Senate seat. He is currently a legislator in the European Parliament.  </p>
