<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An iconic Melbourne park has been covered in dozens of painted circles, leaving residents from a trendy inner-city suburb baffled. </p>

<p>Chapel Street Precinct has partnered with the City of Stonnington Council groundskeeper to transform Prahran Square into a series of fun 'social circles' to entice locals to emerge from the loneliness of harsh lockdowns.</p>

<p>A string of stage four lockdown restrictions were relaxed in Melbourne by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews this week, with outdoor gatherings of up to five people from two households now permitted.</p>

<p>Inspired by the Social Circles project in New York's Domino Park, the spaced out areas encourage residents to picnic in the park in a socially distanced and COVID-safe way without the threat of a $1652 fine.</p>

<p>Prahran Square has been transformed into 'social circles' to coax residents out of lockdown to picnic in a Covid-safe way while support local businesses</p>

<p>'We want to keep the community safe and at the same time, support local businesses, which is in dire need right now,' Chapel Street Precinct general manager Chrissie Maus told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>The park's surprise new additions have sparked intrigue from confused locals in the last week.</p>

<p>'We've had questions like, 'did Daniel Andrews put these here?' Ms Maus laughed.</p>

<p>'We're been planning this for a while now. We were going to do it after the first wave of coronavirus but then we went into lockdown again.'</p>

<p>'We want to bring smiles to people's faces after what's been a very stressful time for everyone. Every single person has been affected.' </p>

<p>Locals are reminded they are still only allowed outdoors for a maximum two hours each day, must live within the five kilometres radius and wear a face mask whenever they're not eating and drinking. </p>

<p>Businesses in Chapel Street, one of Melbourne's most popular retail precincts have been hit hard by stage four lockdowns.</p>

<p>Non-essential businesses are still banned from reopening, with restaurants only available for takeaway.</p>

<p>Residents who use Prahran Square are urged to support local retailers by buying a picnic hamper from partnering businesses. </p>

<p>Treats range from sandwiches, rolls, pretzels and pastries to Asian cuisine, Middle Eastern kaneffi, along with antipasto and cheese platters.</p>

<p>'It's been a very harrowing time,' Ms Maus told Daily Mail Australia </p>

<p>'Many hospitality businesses still haven't opened as doing only takeaway wasn't worth their while.' </p>

<p>'Four weeks of takeaway business is equivalent to a week's profits during usual trading.'</p>

<p>What Prahran Square in inner-city Melbourne looked like before the Chapel Street Precinct partnered with City of Stonnington Council for an exciting trial project</p>

<p>Chapel Street Precinct chairman Justin O’Donnell added: 'There is a groundswell movement for supporting local businesses, this is seeing more people understand the impact they can have by supporting local, the real sense of community is coming back and seen more than ever around our iconic local high street.'</p>

<p>Melbourne's two-hour outdoor exercise limit and 5km travel restriction remain for another three weeks.</p>

<p>Victoria recorded 10 new coronavirus cases and seven more deaths on Tuesday, a day after the state recorded its lowest number of daily new infections since June 12.</p>
