<p>Racy: Married At First Sight's Elizabeth Sobinoff, 29, (L) shared raunchy photos of her boyfriend Seb Guilhaus, 32, (R) on Tuesday, including one in a pair of tiny red jocks</p>

<p>In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress. </p>

<p>In one frame, the tanned Adonis is seen rocking a pair of itty-bitty red jocks, that appeared rolled down, perhaps to avoid tan lines. </p>

<p>Lizzy went on to promote the personal trainer's six-week challenge. 'Far out why would you not join his 6 week challenge,' she questioned.</p>

<p>Before adding: 'Get a glimpse of this every morning and night. He's going to kill me for posting this �� #sorrynotsorry.'</p>

<p>Almost nude: In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress</p>

<p>She finished: 'Literally in the other room right next to me and has no idea' </p>

<p>It comes after the couple sparked engagement rumours, after they swapped silver rings at the weekend.    </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Lizzie shared a sentimental photograph of their new jewellery. </p>

<p>'He said to me ''Is it S &amp; L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it.'  </p>

<p>Ringing it in: 'He said to me ''Is it S &amp; L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it,' Lizzie wrote</p>

<p>Over at Seb's Instagram, he wrote: 'Compromise ... give and take ... melding of two worlds.'</p>

<p>'For relationships to flourish we need to want to really be a part of each others worlds,' he continued. </p>

<p>The rings were just a sweet gesture and not to signify an engagement. </p>

<p>So in love! Elizabeth often shares loved-up selfies with her hunky other half, after meeting him during her second stint on Married At First Sight  </p>

<p>Elizabeth and Seb met while starring on her second season of Married At First Sight in 2020.</p>

<p>The pair were recently forced to spend three months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic, after she returned to Sydney for work while he stayed in Adelaide.  </p>

<p>She said they ultimately stayed connected through 'constant texting' while apart, and finally reunited in June.</p>

<p>Happy couple: Since meeting on the popular dating show, Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are now living as a couple </p>
