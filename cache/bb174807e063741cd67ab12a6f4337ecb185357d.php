<p>Young Irish couple Katie Murtagh and Patrick Earle (pictured together) have been charged over the alleged stabbing of a man that left him stranded in a unit block hallway with a partially severed ear</p>

<p>Neighbours found victim Oliver Solan, 30, barely conscious in a hallway at a Young Street apartment block in Randwick, in Sydney's east, about 8.40pm on Sunday</p>

<p>Earle's girlfriend, 26-year-old Katie Murtagh, let them in before going to hide in a bedroom as the alleged fight ensued</p>

<p>When they arrived Mr Solan was allegedly stabbed multiple times and a part of his ear had been severed off in the fight.</p>

<p>Distressed neighbours called police, who found Mr Solan with multiple stab wounds to his head and body and a chunk of his ear missing.</p>

<p>Paramedics rushed the 30-year-old to St Vincent's Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and remains in a serious but stable condition. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia can reveal Earle, Murtagh and Solan had been drinking together at an eastern suburbs pub earlier that night venue before returning to the couple's apartment. </p>

<p>While there an argument between the two men ensued, with Solan allegedly the first to attack his friend causing injuries to Earle's arm.</p>

<p>It was then that Murtagh allegedly sent a Facebook message to Earle's friends asking them to come over, at which point she let them in to the unit and hid in her room as they attacked Solan with a knife, severing part of an ear.</p>

<p>The glamorous Irish couple were arrested shortly after but the four other men remain on the run with NSW Police now appealing for public assistance to track them down.</p>

<p>NSW Police said the four men they wish to speak to are all originally from Ireland</p>

<p>Police body cam footage shows the moment officers scoured the apartment block looking for the suspects. </p>

<p>The clip showed blood splattered walls and him lying slumped in a corridor before he was taken out on a stretcher. </p>

<p>He was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital for treatment for his injury before he was charged with wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<p>Murtagh was arrested at the unit a short time later and charged with aiding and abetting to wound a person. </p>

<p>Appearing in court via video link, Earle sat quietly wearing a hospital gown and with a bandage over his left ear. </p>

<p>The court was told he is facing a maximum of 25 years in prison if convicted, with a standard non-parole period of seven years.  </p>

<p>Murtagh chose not to appear on screen in court and along with her boyfriend will be held in custody until October 27. </p>

<p>During that time the lovers turned co-accused will not be able to talk.</p>

<p>Police allege that Murtagh was aware of what would happen when she invited and let her boyfriend's backup inside their apartment.</p>

<p>When her boyfriend and the four men fled, CCTV footage allegedly shows her using her strength to drag Solan's bloodied body into the hall.</p>

<p>Distressed neighbours called police, who found Mr Solan with multiple stab wounds to his head and body and a chunk of his ear missing.</p>

<p>Paramedics rushed the 30-year-old to St Vincent's Hospital where he underwent emergency surgery and remains in a serious but stable condition.</p>

<p>As Mr Solan was being attended to by paramedics, police scoured the area hunting for Earle, Murtagh and the other alleged assailants.</p>

<p>Witness Ben Cary told 7News Earle had been chased down the street by police.</p>

<p>'I think he was just trying to get into upstairs, all these cops were chasing him down the street,' Mr Cary said.</p>

<p>Murtagh faced Waverley Local Court on Sunday where the court heard she thought the group of men arrived to the unit to have a chat.</p>

<p>But police allege Murtagh was completely aware of what the men planned to do when she let them inside. </p>

<p>The court heard that she later dragged the barely conscious victim into the hallway before fleeing the scene.</p>
