<p>It was a busy day of playing dress up for Krysten Ritter yesterday as the Don't Trust the B---- in Apartment 23 actress hit the streets of New York City in one, two … and then three different outfits.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old was a fashion watcher’s dream as she continued to enter then exit her downtown hotel in varied outfits, accessories and hairstyles.</p>

<p>Variety is the spice of life: Krysten Ritter changed outfits, accessories and looks three times in a single day</p>

<p>The day’s fashion show began with the raven-haired model arriving to her hotel room in a brown leopard-print sun dress with black mid-calf boots.</p>

<p>Her long hair breezed down her shoulders as she pulled her purple luggage with one hand and sipped up the last of an iced drink with the other.</p>

<p>Shortly later, she emerged with a sleek and chic new look.</p>

<p>Is that how she stays so slim? Krysten Ritter sips on an iceddrink</p>

<p>Channeling the late Audrey Hepburn, Ritter had pulled her hair into a fashionable bun atop her head, which accented her stylish bangs.</p>

<p>A tight black skirt, a gray halter top and gorgeous red pumps completed the gorgeous look.</p>

<p>This was the outfit Ritter chose to go shopping in, hitting up some local boutiques and jewellery stores. An assistant helped her back to the hotel with her bags.</p>

<p>Porcelain skin: Ritter, who avoids the sun, showed off her creamy white skin in this elegant yet revealing get-up</p>

<p>With the sun ready to set over the skyscrapers of New York, Ritter emerged in her third, but final outfit of the day.</p>

<p>The Breaking Bad glamour gal had changed into a stunning blue tie-dyed dress, sleeveless but snug at the top with a loose and flowing hem that came to her ankles.</p>

<p>Ritter carried a smart green and blue clutch as she waited outside for a companion to whisk her off for dinner at a sushi restaurant.</p>

<p>The only question is: What will she wear tomorrow?</p>
