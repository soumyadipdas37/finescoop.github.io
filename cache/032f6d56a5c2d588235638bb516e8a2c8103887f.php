<p>While a former fan wrote: 'You were one of my happiest musical memories. I’m frankly and deeply disappointed in you.' </p>

<p>And James Felton said: 'What the hell do you have against lockdown, the six person rule doubles your audience.'</p>

<p>Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters descended on to Trafalgar Square on Saturday </p>

<p>When one followers called them out over the Q Anon sign in the picture, they replied: 'That's the foundation of free speech, allowing people to express themselves.</p>

<p>'It's irrelevant who we agree with or disagree with.'</p>

<p>Another then added: 'But then you are blocking people,' and the pop stars replied: 'Of course, it's social media, it's not real life. Plus predictable insults deserve no better treatment.'</p>
