<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Caleb Ewan hopes to 'keep winning' after taking victory in a sprint finish to stage three of the Tour de France in Sisteron, denying Sam Bennett on the line.</p>

<p>Australian Ewan (Lotto-Soudal) appeared from nowhere to weave his way through a congested bunch and pass Irishman Bennett (Deceuninck-Quick Step) just before the finish line.</p>

<p>Italian and European road race champion Giacomo Nizzolo (NTT) finished third while Julian Alaphilippe held on to the yellow jersey.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old Australian celebrates on the podium after his fourth stage win of the Tour</p>

<p>It was Ewan's fourth Tour stage win after three victories on his debut last year and after the race he said: 'The last few days haven't been great for us, after we crashed on the first day and lost a couple of guys.</p>

<p>'But everyone stayed motivated and we all knew if it all went right, I could win the sprint today. Everyone today gave it 110 per cent and it worked.</p>

<p>'This is the biggest race in the world and I'm so happy to get another win and prove last year wasn't a fluke. I hope to keep coming back and keep winning.</p>

<p>'With the calibre of sprinter here it's always going to be hard but we have a few more opportunities and I think we'll take them when they come.'</p>

<p>Ewan displayed excellent bike handling skills to navigate his way through a chaotic finish. The 26-year-old narrowly avoided Peter Sagan's back wheel and the right-hand side barrier to get onto Bennett's wheel before he kicked clear with tremendous speed at the 50-metre marker.Â </p>

<p>'I was a bit too far forward in the final kilometre so I dropped back and gave myself a bit of a rest,' said Ewan 'Coming from behind is a bit of a risk but I got through past the barrier and had the speed in the end.'</p>

<p>Three-time world champion Sagan faded to finish fifth but picked up enough points to replace stage one winner Alexander Kristoff in the green points jersey.</p>

<p>The high octane finish to the race was in contrast to a largely sedate day, with France's Jerome Cousin spending 110km off the front alone before he was swept by the peloton with 16km to go.</p>

<p>Cousin had been in a breakaway with compatriots Benoit Cosnefroy and Anthony Perez, who was forced out of the race with a broken collarbone after he suffered a puncture and crashed into his Cofidis team car.</p>

<p>Britain's Adam Yates is still second overall, while defending champion Egan Bernal has moved up two places to sixth.</p>
