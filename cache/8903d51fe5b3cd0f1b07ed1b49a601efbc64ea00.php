<p>The woman, who hasn't been publicly named, was hiking with a friend in the Tapia Park region of the Malibu Creek State Park when she began to feel sick.</p>

<p>The pair, who had been hiking since 8am, decided to turn around and head back to their car when suddenly the woman collapsed and suffered a seizure, the LA County Sheriff’s Department said.</p>

<p>Her friend frantically dialed 911, and paramedics with the LA County Fire Department arrived on scene shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>EMTs conducted CPR on the woman for between 20 to 30 minutes but were unable to revive her.</p>

<p>She was pronounced dead at around 2:10pm local time on Saturday, in an area of the park near to Calabasas.</p>

<p>Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Morgan Arteaga told CNN the woman’s death was most likely heat-related and also the result of ‘natural causes of some kind’, but said a coroner would provide the official cause of death at a later date.</p>

<p>The LA County Sheriff's Office did not publicly name the woman. Arteaga said her death was the only heat-related fatality. </p>

<p>According to the National Weather Service, temperatures in the area around the time of the woman's death registered at more than 110 degrees.</p>

<p>Malibu Search and Rescue, a unit within the sheriff’s department, said it responded to several heat-related rescues Saturday.</p>

Officials warned against being out in the high temperatures, especially with pets.</p>

<p>‘Effective immediately, we have been advised that all trails in the Santa Monica Mountains will be closed through Labor Day,’ the Malibu Search and Rescue team wrote on Twitter on Saturday.</p>

<p>‘We responded to several heat related rescues today, including one hiker who unfortunately perished. PLEASE DO NOT #HIKE IN THIS #HEATWAVE. #CAwx #LAHeat.’</p>

<p>Los Angeles County recorded its highest-ever temperature on Saturday - a staggering 121 degrees in Woodland Hills.</p>

<p>The Sheriff’s department posted Sunday about saving a 22-year-old woman who ‘lost consciousness’ at the beach, sharing photos of first responders transporting her away for medical attention.</p>
