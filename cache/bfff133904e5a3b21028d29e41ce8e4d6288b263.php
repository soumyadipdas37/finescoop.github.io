<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Queensland government will keep state borders closed for least a month, citing concerns about community transmission of COVID-19 in southern states.</p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the borders will stay shut on Tuesday, as a Victorian man who had coronavirus was caught trying to the enter the state and two more local cases were reported.</p>

<p>'We said we would review at the end of the each month and there has been no advice from the chief health officer to change what we are doing,' she said.</p>

<p>The premier said Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young wanted to see southern states, and NSW in particular, go through two COVID-19 incubation cycles without any cases of community transmission.</p>

<p>This is despite widespread fears the border shutdowns will cripple the economy, with Queensland's closure alone costing $17million a day. </p>

<p>Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured) says the borders will stay shut on Tuesday as a Victorian man who had coronavirus was caught trying to the enter the state</p>

<p>She said her border closures had been vindicated by the arrest of a Victorian man with COVID-19 arriving at Brisbane Airport on Monday (pictured, the border on August 7)</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what we're looking for: to keep Queenslanders safe, that's what we're looking for,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>'Dr Young, our chief health officer, has made it very clear that she doesn't want to see community transmission and there is community transmission at the moment in the southern states.'</p>

<p>She said her border closures had been vindicated by the arrest of a Victorian man with COVID-19 who allegedly arrived at Brisbane Airport on Monday.</p>

<p>Victorian authorities had been trying to find the man after he tested positive for the virus a few weeks ago.</p>

<p>He was intercepted by police at the airport after arriving on his 9.19am flight and could be charged after further investigation.</p>

<p>'This is great work from the police that have been able to apprehend this man, who was trying to get into Queensland illegally,' Ms Palaszczuk said.</p>

<p>'This goes to show how strong our border measures and the fact that they are working.'</p>

<p>The premier said contact tracing would be conducted on passengers on the flight and some may need to self-quarantine.</p>

<p>Melbourne has been the worst impacted state by COVID-19, with the city under Stage Four lockdown (pictured, a couple walking along the Yarra Banks on September 1)</p>

<p>Queensland recorded another two COVID-19 cases in 24 hours to 9am, with the total number of active cases reaching 28.</p>

<p>One case was an 18-year-old student at Staines Memorial College at Redbank Plains.</p>

<p>The school has closed indefinitely after another student tested positive on Sunday night. All 600 students are being screened.</p>

<p>The second case was a 37-year-old male nurse who worked at Ipswich Hospital.</p>

<p>The man felt abdominal pain and decided to get tested as a precaution.</p>

<p>Health Minister Steven Miles thanked the nurse for his exemplary actions.</p>

<p>'It underlines how we can all do the right thing by monitoring our health and if we have any symptoms at all that are of any cause for concern we can go and get tests,' he said.</p>

<p>Queensland recorded another two COVID-19 cases in 24 hours to 9am, one was a 37-year-old male nurse who worked at Ipswich Hospital (pictured)</p>

<p>The health minister said 7,489 had been conducted in 24 hours to 9am on Tuesday, UPfrom more than 6,865 in the previous 24 hours.</p>

<p>Health restrictions remain in place preventing more than 10 people gathering in Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan, the Gold Coast, South Burnett and Goondiwindi without a COVID-19 safety plan.</p>

<p>Mr Miles conceded on Monday restrictions could remain for up to four weeks.</p>
