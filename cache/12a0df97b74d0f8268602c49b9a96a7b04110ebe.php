<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>NSW Police have charged a man with breaching a coronavirus direction after he allegedly tried to cross the NSW-Victoria border in a taxi to go shopping in Albury.</p>

<p>Police say they stopped a Victorian taxi at about 4.30pm on Saturday at a checkpoint on the Hume Highway at Albury.</p>

<p>The passenger, a 26-year-old man, told police he wanted to go shopping in Albury but when asked to produce a permit it was found to be invalid, police said in a statement.</p>

<p>He was arrested and taken to Albury Police Station where he was charged with not complying with a COVID-19 direction and breach of bail.</p>

<p>He was refused bail to appear at Wagga Wagga Bail Court on Sunday.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Victoria's 'roadmap' out of lockdown announced in early September is expected to be tweaked on Sunday following better-than-expected progress.</p>

<p>Under the original plans to take effect from Monday, the 9pm curfew would remain, as well as the 5km travel limit and takeaway-only for restaurants and cafes.</p>

<p>Restrictions around public gatherings would ease to allow up to five people from a maximum of two households to meet outside for social interaction.</p>

<p>The Victorian opposition is calling for rules to be loosened well beyond this, saying the curfew should go, all school students should return and restaurants, retail and offices should re-open.</p>

<p>It has been a dramatic few days in Victorian politics culminating in the resignation of Jenny Mikakos as health minister on Saturday morning.</p>

<p>To date, 782 Victorians have died of the virus and the entire state has been subject to strict lockdowns, workforce and school closures and prolonged social isolation. </p>
