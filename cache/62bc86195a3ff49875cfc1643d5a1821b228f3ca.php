<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This was Aston Villa’s second league game of the season - they will not have an easier one from the remaining 36.</p>

<p>That’s not to say Dean Smith’s side weren’t impressive here at Craven Cottage because they were; goals from Jack Grealish, Conor Hourihane and Tyrone Mings maintaining Villa’s perfect start to the season.</p>

<p>But as good as they were, Fulham were equally as poor. Three games in, zero points with 10 goals conceded isn’t an easy read for any football manager - particularly one with the standards of Scott Parker.</p>

<p>Captain Jack Grealish put Aston Villa ahead after just four minutes against Fulham</p>

<p>Yet that’s the reality. Judging by this most comprehensive of defeats it’s difficult to see how it improves.</p>

<p>This encounter was effectively over after 15 minutes. Villa’s attacking invention was sharp and decisive; but Fulham’s defending - just like it was during their previous Premier League season when they conceded 81 goals - was disastrously basic.</p>

<p>The opener arrived in the fourth minute. John McGinn’s pass was on point, Grealish’s run was timed to perfection while his finish past Alphonse Areola was crisp.</p>

<p> John McGinn clipped a lovely pass onto the run of Jack Grealish for the opening goal</p>

<p> The forward timed his run perfectly before slotting the ball past goalkeeper Alphonse Areol</p>

<p>But it was all too easy for Villa; the disappointment written on Parker’s face told its own story.</p>

<p>Eleven minutes later Fulham were two down. Yet again there was plenty to desire about the slickness of Villa’s attacking play as Oliie Watkins, Grealish and McGinn combined to effortlessly dissect Fulham before Conor Hourihane smartly finished beyond Areola.</p>

<p>The defending, in contrast, was atrocious. Smith would have been ecstatic - but by the same token, he knew his team were on easy street here.</p>

<p>The visitors doubled their advantage in the 15th minute with Conor Hourihane's tidy finish</p>

<p>Jack Grealish combined with John McGinn to set up Conor Hourihane for the second goal</p>

<p>In layman’s terms: if Fulham continue defending in this vein, they will be relegated. Simple.</p>

<p>Parker will be well aware of that harsh reality if he doesn’t find a solution to their defensive deficiencies - and fast.</p>

<p>Aleksander Mitrovic headed narrowly wide from Joe Bryan’s cross in the 19th minute - but that was all Fulham to show for their opening 45 minutes.</p>

<p>Indeed, they were lucky not to have conceded two more before the break. Watkins missed Trezeguet’s cross by a whisker before seeing his header on the stroke of half time unwittingly deflected wide.</p>

<p>Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings added the third goal just after half-time on Monday</p>

<p>Conor Hourihane's free-kick from the left was poked it into an open net by Tyrone Mings</p>

<p>It wouldn’t have been harsh on the host’s either. The only positive for Parker was that his team couldn’t be any worse in the second half.</p>

<p>But to honest they weren’t much better. It took Villa less than four minutes to notch a third - Mings left unmarked to stab home Hourihane’s outswinging free kick after Dennis Odoi cynically brought down Grealish - who is surely in with a strong shout to retain his place in the England on Thursday on the back of this showing.</p>

<p>It was a simple goal, much like Fulham’s defending.</p>

<p>Bobby Decordova-Reid thought he had given his side a lifeline by scoring from close range</p>

<p>Decordova-Reid saw his effort ruled out for a foul by Aleksandar Mitrovic in the build-up</p>

<p>McGinn was denied the goal his display deserved in the 52nd minute, Alphonse saving with his feet as Villa waltzed through again.</p>

<p>Parker could only stand and watch, his team were being dismantled by a team who last season scraped to survival on the final day of the season.</p>

<p>Yet the gulf between the teams was abundantly clear here.</p>

<p>Aston Villa forward Jack Grealish is challenged by Fulham's Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa</p>

<p>Even when Fulham thought they’d pulled a goal back they were left on their knees after Bobby Cordova-Reid tapped the ball home when Emiliano Martinez’s spilled Aboubakar Kamara’s long-range striker only for the goal to be ruled out by VAR for a foul by Mitrovic in the build up.</p>

<p>But at least Fulham were showing a semblance of fight. Mitrovic headed narrowly wide before Tom Cairney curled an effort. It was all too little too late, of course.</p>

<p>Fulham sporting director Tony Khan issued an apology to supporters on Twitter after the final whistle.</p>

<p>Unless something changes, he may be doing a lot of that this season.</p>

<p>Defender Kenny Tete suffered a leg injury in the first-half was replaced by Aboubakar Kamara</p>

<p>Fulham host Aston Villa at Craven Cottage in the first game on Monday evening in the Premier League.  </p>

<p>Scott Parker's side are yet to record their first points of the season, after defeats against Arsenal and Leeds in their opening two matches following their promotion from the Championship. </p>

<p>Aston Villa, meanwhile, have won their first three games of the new season in all competitions, including a 1-0 victory against Sheffield United at Villa Park in their league opener last week, courtesy of Ezri Konsa's winner.  </p>

<p>Sportsmail will provide live coverage of Fulham vs Aston Villa including score, lineups and build-up. </p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>Stuart Attwell blows up for full-time as Aston Villa continue their 100 per cent start to the season.</p>

<p>Villa seized control early on by netting twice in the opening 15 minutes, extending their lead when Mings slid in at the start of the second half. </p>

<p>Fulham showed limited fighting spirit and thought they had found a way back into the game when Bobby Decordova-Reid tapped in, only for the referee to disallow the goal due to a foul committed by Aleksandr Mitrovic. </p>

<p>Nevertheless, Scott Parker will be left pulling his hair out after another shambolic defensive display. The Cottagers have conceded 10 goals in their first three league matches this term.</p>

<p>Excellent save by Martinez! Joe Bryan drives towards the top right corner and the former Arsenal keeper stretches with his top right hand to tip onto the crossbar.</p>

<p>A scuffle follows after the ball trickles out of play for a throw in, and Aboubakar Kamara and Tyrone Mings are subsequently booked.</p>

<p>McGinn sends a free-kick from the left flank into the box which Mings meets with a header. Areola safely tips over. </p>

<p>Villa make their final change seconds later, with Douglas Luiz making way for Marvelous Nakamba.</p>

<p>Bertrand Traore replaces Trezeguet to make his league debut for Aston Villa.</p>

<p>Fulham have run out of steam while Villa seem capable of pushing for more goals.</p>

<p>Trezeguet sees his low shot blocked by the diving Joe Bryan.</p>

<p>Bobby Decordova-Reid trudges off and is replaced by Neeskens Kebano.</p>

<p>Villa make their first change. Jacob Ramsey comes on to make his Premier League debut, replacing Conor Hourihane.</p>

<p>Mitrovic battles with Konsa and heads narrowly wide at the back post. </p>

<p>Stuart Attwell decides to penalise Mitrovic for his penalty box wrestling.</p>

<p>The ball falls to Anguissa after a goalmouth scramble and his fierce shot is blocked by Matty Cash. McGinn seizes upon the loose ball and is cynically brought down by Le Marchand. </p>

<p>The defender is rightly shown a yellow card.</p>

<p>Odoi is walking a tightrope here. He fouls Grealish yet again but evades a second yellow card.</p>

<p>In the following phase of play, Grealish volleys over from a tight angle.</p>

<p>McGinn is show a yellow card for a tough tackle on Joe Bryan. The Fulham full-back picks himself up to deliver to the back post where Mitrovic's towering header drifts wide.</p>

<p>Le Marchand has also come on at the back for Fulham in place of Michael Hector.</p>

<p>Fulham's misery deepens. The hosts thought they were back in this one when Bobby Reid tapped in from close range after Martinez spilled Anguissa's shot.</p>

<p>Stuart Attwell is then prompted to look at the pitchside monitor and spots Mitrovic has pulled down Konsa in the box. </p>

<p>Goal disallowed after VAR review.</p>

<p>Conor Hourihane swings in a quick free-kick and Tyrone Mings shows the presence of mind to dart into the box and poke beyond the onrushing Areola. The Fulham defenders were completely out of sync and failed to track the Villa man's run.</p>

<p>Fulham 0-3 Aston Villa (48 minutes)</p>

<p>Denis Odoi is shown a yellow card after getting too tight to Jack Grealish. The Villa captain spins in behind and Odoi drags him down.</p>

<p>Villa get proceedings back underway at Craven Cottage.</p>

<p>No substitutions have been made at the beginning of this second half.</p>

<p>Stuart Attwell blows up for half time.</p>

<p>Dean Smith's side are in cruise control after scoring two goals in the opening 15 minutes. </p>

<p>Jack Grealish gave Villa the lead when he latched on to John McGinn's chipped pass to volley under Alphonse Areola, and Conor Hourihane slotted into the bottom corner to round off an excellent passing move.</p>

<p>It looks a long way back from here for Scott Parker's side who have once again decided to throw caution to the wind from the very first whistle. The home side's back five have been in disarray.</p>

<p>Joe Bryan is shown a yellow card for a heavy challenge on John McGinn by the touchline.</p>

<p>Hourihane wins a corner as his long-range strike is deflected behind by Michael Hector. </p>

<p>The Irishman subsequently sends a perfect delivery into the box and Ollie Watkins somehow conspires to head wide with the goal gaping.</p>

<p>Fulham win a free-kick in a promising position after Cavaleiro is tripped by Matty Cash. </p>

<p>Bryan swings in from the left flank but the ball is headed clear by Ezri Konsa.</p>

<p>Kenny Tete is down on the turf receiving treatment. The full-back seems to be holding his calf.</p>

<p>Scott Parker moves to send on Aboubakar Kamara in his place.</p>

<p>Once again, Fulham are sloppy and give the ball away in midfield with their full-backs high up the pitch. Villa break quickly with Ollie Watkins cutting in from the left. The Villa forward proceeds to lash high and wide.</p>

<p>Grealish loses the ball by playing a risky sideways pass across the edge of the box. Unfortunately for Fulham, Cavaleiro snatches at the chance and boots the ball over the bar.</p>

<p>Villa go agonisingly close to scoring a third. </p>

<p>Jack Grealish embarks on a trademark run from deep and he feeds McGinn who passes on to Trezeguet on the right flank. He fires a low delivery across the face of goal but the diving Watkins is unable to get a touch on the ball.</p>

<p>Tom Cairney is rather harshly booked for a trip on McGinn in midfield.</p>

<p>Fulham respond as Bryan whips in a fine cross from the left flank, but Mitrovic is unable to make clear contact with his head and the ball lands in the empty stand behind Martinez's goal.</p>

<p>Ollie Watkins makes an intelligent run to get on the end of a throw in down the left flank. He picks out Grealish with an incisive pass. He reaches the byline and pulls back to McGinn who touches delicately into the path of Conor Hourihane. The Irishman passes emphatically into the bottom right corner. </p>

<p>The Fulham players let their heads drop in disbelief. </p>

<p>Fulham 0-2 Aston Villa (15 minutes)</p>

<p>Mitrovic heads towards goal from Tete's right-wing cross, but his effort is easily held by Martinez. Konsa and Cash did just about enough to put off the Fulham forward.</p>

<p>Matt Targett is shown a yellow card after a late challenge on Tete.</p>

<p>Bobby Decordova-Reid is also booked for dissent.</p>

<p>John McGinn roams freely through the midfield and chips over the top of the Fulham defence and Jack Grealish times his run perfectly, volleying under Areola and into the net.</p>

<p>Fulham 0-1 Aston Villa (4 minutes)</p>

<p>Bright start by Fulham. Joe Bryan works the ball to Cavaleiro out wide and his left-wing cross is headed away by Tyrone Mings.</p>

<p>PEEP!</p>

<p>Referee Stuart Attwell blows his whistle at Craven Cottage and Fulham get things underway.</p>

<p>Both sets of players have finished warming up ahead of this Premier League fixture. We are under 10 minutes away from kick-off at Craven Cottage</p>

<p>Alphonse Areola continues in goal for Fulham after making his Premier League debut in the 4-3 defeat at Leeds. </p>

<p>The Frenchman, who has signed for the Cottagers on loan from Paris Saint-Germain, has displaced Marek Rodak in recent weeks.</p>

<p>Bertrand Traore scored just 14 minutes into his Aston Villa debut in the 3-0 League Cup victory at Bristol City, but manager Dean Smith has opted to place the winger on the bench at Fulham.</p>

<p>Villa paid £17m to sign the Burkinabe from Lyon earlier this month.</p>
