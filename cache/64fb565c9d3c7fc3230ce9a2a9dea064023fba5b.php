<p>Brielle displayed notably more natural-looking lips in her posts than she had in the past.</p>

<p>In February, she revealed that she had dissolved the fillers in her famously plump lips, and photos throughout quarantine showed off her more natural look.</p>

<p>'I’ve been getting them injected off and on since I was 18. I flew out to LA in June 2015 and wanted them done so badly,' she told People back in February.</p>

<p>Brielle admitted that the numerous injections left her lips looking too big, but the gradual progression made it difficult for her to know when she had gone too far.</p>

<p>'I didn’t realize how big they were,' she said. 'I’d be like, "Oh, I’m going to LA," and they’re like, "Okay, well maybe let’s not inject the top lip. The top looks good. Let’s do the bottom." I was like, "F*** you guys. I’m going to do what I want."'</p>

<p>'I didn’t realize how crazy it looked. I feel looking back, my lips really looked a little crazy,' she added.   </p>
