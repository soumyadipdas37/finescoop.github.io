<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Our fantasy share picking game returned last week, as those who read This is Money regularly and our newsletter will know.</p>

<p>This year we are offering players the chance to win a £15,000 jackpot prize and runners-up prizes of £5,000 and £2,000, but it was the weekly prize of £500 that proved one of my highlights last time round.</p>

<p>That’s because it gave me the chance to hear some great stories from our readers, when I got in touch to let the weekly winner know they’d bagged the best performing pick of the week – and ask them about themselves for our weekly share game email.</p>

<p>A small cap gold explorer proved the pick of the week in our share game, but it was the player who made the story</p>

<p>There were some good tales – including the family playing against each other who managed to score bragging rights in different weeks – and this year’s game’s first weekly winner has delivered another one.</p>

<p>In a week that’s proved somewhat depressing, as coronavirus restrictions are ratcheted up again and fears of a full-on lockdown to follow loom large, I thought I’d share it with you.</p>

<p>The winning share pick last week was gold explorer Greatland Gold, which saw its shares rocket on positive news.</p>

<p>So far, so small cap gold company share. But it was the player who had picked it that made the story.</p>

<p>The winner of our weekly prize with a 33.66 per cent gain over the week from picking Greatland Gold was 76-year-old grandmother-of-three Saratha Devi Sivagnanasundaram.</p>

<p>The retired radiographer, told me that she lives in London with her husband and moved to the UK from Sri Lanka in 1974.</p>

<p>She has never bought or sold shares but Saratha said she was tempted to play the Fantasy Share Picking Game after her family told her about it.</p>

<p>‘When I started playing this game I told my grandson, who is 11 years old, that my aim is to win one of the weekly prizes,’ she said.</p>

<p>Saratha, whose hobby is puzzle solving, chose Greatland Gold after looking at share price performance charts in order to pick ten shares.</p>

<p>She said: ‘I watched it and on Friday I was really disappointed for not selling it when it was high. I had a feeling it may go up again on Monday. So from the start I watched the This is Money day chart for Greatland Gold and when it went up I sold it.</p>

<p>‘I only follow the graph and my gut feeling.’</p>

<p>Whether they come from long-standing readers or people new to This is Money, it is this kind of story that we love to hear from our readers and podcast listeners.</p>

<p>And it’s the kind of thing that makes doing things away from the daily financial news, such as the Fantasy Share Picking Game or podcast, rewarding.</p>

<p>The share picking game runs until 4 December and there is still plenty of time to sign up and play - either for the prizes or for fun - but this column isn’t meant to be a shameless plug for the game, so I will leave just leave things here with the note than you can sign up to play here or get some tips on how to pick shares and do well below.</p>

<p>Players' tactics on how to play the game differ. </p>

<p>Some may choose to use their maximum weekly picks and build up a sizeable number of share picks that are open. </p>

<p>But while this opens up the possibility of bigger gains from more companies, it also raises the risk that you hold shares that fall and your overall performance is dented.</p>

<p>Anthony Pepler: The musician won This is Money's Fantasy Share Picking Game last year</p>

<p>Alternatively, others may decide a focussed and tight, smaller number of shares is a better option. </p>

<p>That means they need big gains to win from a smaller selection of shares, but have less risk of the share price turning against them. </p>

<p>Last year, the game allowed an unlimited number of share picks but only 20 live picks at any one time. </p>

<p>This enabled some players to use a tactic of trading in big volumes and banking lots of small gains. </p>

<p>That was used to great effect by the game's winner 25-year-old musician Anthony Pepler, playing as Big Trade Bull.</p>

<p>To make the game different this year, we have tweaked the rules: the 20 live picks limit is gone, but players can only make a maximum of 10 picks per week in the prize league - and they cannot buy the same company twice in the same day.</p>

<p>This means the high volume trading strategy won't work in the same way, so you'll need to decide what will. </p>

<p>One thing to keep an eye on is early morning official stock market announcements on the Regulatory News Service. </p>

<p>These statements are released before the market opens and companies that have done better than expected are likely to see their shares op on open - while those that disappoint will fall.</p>

<p>Often that momentum is continued through the day, so these shares can be worth buying. </p>

<p>Also, look out for momentum over a longer period - shares making higher highs and lower lows, rising above their 200 or 50 day moving averages and seeing consistent gains on higher volume of trading. </p>
