<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A young Sydney man was stabbed while getting a haircut after his accused killer received a message that there was 'a dog' in the barbershop, a jury has heard.</p>

<p>Fredon Laith Botrus, 20, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Alfredo Isho, who was knifed while seated and gowned at Bossley Park's Classico Hair Studio on January 11, 2019.</p>

<p>Witnesses are due to recall seeing the helmet-wearing assailant enter the rear of the shop and plunge a knife into Mr Isho's chest about 12.30pm, the NSW Supreme Court was told on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Fredon Laith Botrus, 20, has pleaded not guilty to murdering Alfredo Isho (pictured), who was knifed while seated and gowned at Bossley Park's Classico Hair Studio on January 11, 2019</p>

<p>In his opening address on Tuesday, crown prosecutor Michael Clark said the knife penetrated Mr Isho's right lung and severed an artery but he armed himself with scissors and quickly walked outside.</p>

<p>CCTV shown to the jury shows Mr Isho outside the barbershop moments after the stabbing, pursued by several concerned witnesses.</p>

<p>The young man soon became pale and was rushed to hospital, where he died about 5pm, Mr Clark said.</p>

<p>The CCTV allegedly also traces the path of the assailant from near the Botrus family home in Bossley Park to the barbershop and then back to a place near the Botrus home.</p>

<p>The white motorcycle the assailant was seen leaving the barbershop on was allegedly later found in Botrus's garage, stripped of its petrol tank and fairings and being cooled down with fans.</p>

<p>Mr Isho's blood had also been found on a jumper the then 18-year-old Botrus was wearing when arrested in his father's car about 3pm that day, the jury is expected to hear.</p>

<p>Police and paramedics are seen at the scene of the stabbing</p>

<p>As well as denying being the motorcyclist, Botrus denied authoring texts found on his phone sent through encrypted application wickr on the day of the murder.</p>

<p>Mr Clark told the jury the first message received by Botrus's phone about 11.30am used a mix of Arabic, English and emoji to say in effect: 'Yo brother there's a dog at the hairdresser's.'</p>

<p>After the stabbing, Botrus allegedly messaged the same account back to say 'I went and anked him' and 'is that bad'.</p>

<p>But when Botrus confirmed he did 'get him', the other account called him a 'SK', Mr Clark said.</p>

<p>'Biggest SK,' the other account remarked before the pair laughed.</p>

<p>The messages were found on the phone after Botrus was arrested and gave police his phone PIN.</p>

<p>He also gave two recorded interviews that day that his barrister admits contained 'some lies'.</p>

<p>Without going into detail, Sam Pararajasingham accepted his client had sought to distance himself from the motorbike and the circumstances in which it was found.</p>

<p>The jury would need to consider what had driven him to tell such lies but 'irrespective of all these matters, none of that means he committed the act of murder', the barrister said.</p>

<p>'There was and there is no motive for murder,' Mr Pararajasingham said.</p>

<p>Botrus told police he didn't know who Mr Isho was and said he'd been at home in bed about 12.30pm.</p>

<p>He denied stripping the bike down or buying any helmets or riding gear, Mr Clark said.</p>

<p>The trial is due to resume on Wednesday.</p>
