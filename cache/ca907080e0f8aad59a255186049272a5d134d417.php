<p>Flaunting her killer physique, mother-of-four Kim stunned in a grey running top and matching cycling shorts, favouring Lauren's number.</p>

<p>In 2018, the model welcomed comparisons to the businessman from fans, stating in her Now! magazine column: 'It's a massive compliment, of course, when people say we're similar.</p>

<p>'I think she is absolutely amazing but I'm not trying to be her. Yes, we both have big booties and we like a pout and a selfie but that's about it really.' </p>

<p>Lookalikes? The former TOWIE star, 33, uploaded side by side throwback photos of the curvaceous beauties to highlight their similarities</p>

<p>Just last month, the TV personality hit out at social media users who praise Kim for uploading a racy picture while slamming Lauren for her sizzling shots.</p>

<p>The brunette told The Sun: 'Kim posts a topless selfie and she's a feminist. I post a bikini picture and get called an attention seeker. It's double standards. There is no need for it. </p>

<p>'And calling me a bad role model? I just laugh. I'm Kate Middleton's favourite TOWIE star, so I must be doing something right.</p>

<p>'I'm like a rock star, so I've got haters. These people aren't happy. I look at them and think, you must be so deeply unhappy in your life to be making so much of an effort to comment on mine.' </p>

<p>'I just can't have that in my life': Earlier this week, Lauren revealed in this week's New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Lauren revealed in this week's New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame. </p>

<p>She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.</p>

<p>'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me. </p>

<p>'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".' </p>

<p>The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.</p>

<p>Lauren recently broke down in tears as she detailed her first therapy session in a candid Instagram video.</p>

<p>Reflecting on her past, the Bethnal Green native became emotional as she detailed her anxiety battle. </p>

<p>Declaring she wants to be 'the best version' of herself, she insisted she'll share her experience with at-home counselling with her fans every week in a bid for them to discover 'the real Lauren'.</p>
