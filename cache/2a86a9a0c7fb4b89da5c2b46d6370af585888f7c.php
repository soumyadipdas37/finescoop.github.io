<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he'd take a coronavirus vaccine 'tomorrow' even if it caused him to lose the 2020 presidential election to President Donald Trump. </p>

<p>'If I could get a vaccine tomorrow I'd do it. If it would cost me the election I'd do it,' Biden said Monday on a campaign trip to Lancaster and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. 'We need a vaccine and we need it now. As quickly as we can get it.'</p>

<p>On the White House's North Portico Monday, Trump said Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris needed to ''immediately apologize for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric.' </p>

<p>Democratic nominee Joe Biden said he's take a coronavirus vaccine 'tomorrow' even if it cost him the election during a campaign stop Monday in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. 'We need a vaccine and we need it now. As quickly as we can get it' </p>

<p>Joe Biden was asked if he'd take a coronavirus vaccine if one was available before the November 3 presidential election, to which he said yes, but also if it was vouched for by scientists and medical professionals </p>

<p>Over the weekend, Harris had told CNN that she would not trust Trump's word on the safety of a coronavirus vaccine, because she feared he might fast-track it to help him win the November 3 election. </p>

<p>'I will say that I would not trust Donald Trump and it would have to be a credible source of information that talks about the efficacy and the reliability of whatever he’s talking about. I will not take his word for it,' the California senator said. </p>

<p>On the campaign trail, Biden hammered Trump for turning the coronavirus generally into a political football. </p>

<p>'One of the problems is the way he's playing with politics. He's said so many things that aren't true. And I'm worried that if we do have a really good vaccine people are going to be reluctant to take it,' Biden told reporters outside a Lancaster campaign stop. </p>

<p>'And so he's undermining public confidence,' Biden added. </p>

<p>Biden also said he would want experts to vouch for a vaccine.  </p>

<p>'I would want to see what the scientists said,' he said when asked if he'd be comfortable taking a vaccine. </p>

<p>Trump infamously suggested in the White House briefing room that Americans might be able to inject disinfectants or use sunlight to kill the virus - after hearing that those things kill the coronavirus on surfaces. </p>

<p>Trump also pushed the drug hydroxychloroquine, which still hasn't measured up as a true coronavirus cure. </p>

<p>The president has also allowed supporters to be lax about mask-wearing and social distancing. </p>

<p>He gave his Republican National Convention speech in front of an audience of 1,500 at the White House, where the chairs weren't socially distanced. </p>

<p>He greeted crowds Wednesday in Wilmington, North Carolina who were pressed together at the airport with most not wearing masks. </p>

<p>And he held a rally with thousands in both an airport hangar and then in overflow in Latrobe, Pennsylvania on Thursday night. </p>

<p>Again, most of the crowd was scrunched together and not wearing masks. </p>

<p>Biden and Harris started traveling more the week after the RNC, but have only met with small groups so far. </p>

<p>On Monday, Biden first met with four union members in Lancaster for a discussion. </p>

<p>There, he criticized Trump for spending too much time golfing, as the president played a game Sunday at his Virginia golf club.    </p>

<p>'He has been spending too much time on the golf courses and the sand traps,' Biden said during a campaign stop in Lancaster, Pennsylvania Monday. </p>

<p>The former VP continued to capitalize on The Atlantic's reporting that Trump had called American war dead 'losers' and 'suckers.' </p>

<p>Biden asked Howard Nash, a member of the National Guard, what he thought of Trump's comments.</p>

<p>'Do you think most of those guys are suckers?' Biden asked. </p>

<p>Three of those four participants in the discussion were veterans.    </p>
