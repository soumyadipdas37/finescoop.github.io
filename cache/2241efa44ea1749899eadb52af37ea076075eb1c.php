<p>Happy family: The soap star who welcomed her son Mexx with footballer Kean Bryan in October</p>

<p>Open and honest: After welcoming Mexx last year, she confessed that after his arrival she was not expecting her body to change in the way it did</p>

<p>Brooke explained: 'Tonight I was supposed to look completely different, I was supposed to be dressed up, hair and make up done ready to eat some nice food and maybe have my first cocktail in 11 months with Kean. </p>

<p>'Our first time away from Mexx for an hour or two, instead I look like this. I look like this because I naively thought that 4 weeks after my baby I would be in all my old clothes looking exactly like I did before I got pregnant.' [sic]</p>

<p>The thespian confessed she was 'ashamed' as she struggled to fit into nearly two dozen of her old clothes, before comparing herself to fellow working mothers.</p>

<p>Struggling: Discussing the post on the show, she said: 'I'm still struggling to breathe in these jeans they are so tight! When I posted that picture, me and my boyfriend were going out for couple hours without Mexx'</p>

<p>'I thought I've got clothes now, I can pop my self back into clothes, it wasn't the case. even baggy stuff wasn't baggy, my waist had changed. When I put them on Insta it's after I've doubted with them in my own head... </p>

<p>'I didn't put the post up for people to say you look mailing, it's to understand, must be so normal as never spoke about'. </p>

<p>'I look like a completely different person': She has been refreshingly honest</p>
