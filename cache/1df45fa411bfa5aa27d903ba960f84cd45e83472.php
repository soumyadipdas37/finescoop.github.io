<p>'I was walking down Sheridan Road and all of a sudden shots started ringing out: bang, bang, bang,' Badoni said. 'People started screaming ''People have been shot, oh my god.'' They were yelling at the police.</p>

<p>'More bullets started ringing out and everyone started running in the opposite direction. But I decided to run towards the bullets because I saw a gentleman to my right and one to my left that were on the ground.</p>

<p>'I decided to run towards a particular person, it ended up being Anthony.'</p>

<p>Anthony Huber, 26, was shot and killed at a protest for the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin last Tuesday</p>

<p>Badoni (pictured) said: 'More bullets started ringing out and everyone started running in the opposite direction. But I decided to run towards the bullets because I saw a gentleman to my right and one to my left that were on the ground. I decided to run towards a particular person, it ended up being Anthony'</p>

<p>Huber, 26, was shot dead along with Texas native Joseph Rosenbaum, 36. Local medic Gaige Grosskreutz was shot in the arm but survived.</p>

<p>Following the shooting, police charged 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse with two homicides and one attempted homicide – writing in their complaint that he used an AR-15 style rifle and called a friend as he ran away from the murders saying 'I just killed somebody.' </p>

<p>'There were a lot of people around him, screaming, hollering and trying to get him to wake up and breathe,' Badoni said.</p>

<p>'People were trying to take his clothes off to see where the bullet was. I couldn't see any blood, but he was already face down.</p>

<p>'I told everybody 'Please back up' and we rolled him over. I felt the pulse on his neck, there was none. His eyes were rolled back into his head, he was not breathing.</p>

<p>'I decided to start CPR. After I did about 10 or 15 pumps, the SWAT came up behind me and took control of the situation.'</p>

<p>The veteran, who served as a US Marshal after leaving the military, said she saw Huber's girlfriend Hannah Gittings running towards the gruesome scene, screaming for help.</p>

<p>'As he was being taken into the truck his girlfriend Hannah was coming down the street screaming 'Oh my god, that's my boyfriend, please let me see him,' Badoni said.</p>

<p>'It was terrible to see this gentleman pretty much dead and to see her frantic and trying to get to see her boyfriend. It's a scene I'll never forget.</p>

<p>'I couldn't sleep after. It's an overwhelming and nightmarish kind of feeling.' </p>

<p>Huber stumbled away from the gunman clutching his chest (right) as another man appeared to put his hands up in front of the shooter</p>

<p>Huber could be seen hitting the gunman over the head with a skateboard before struggling with the gunman as gunshots rang out and people fled from the scene  </p>

<p>The 50-year-old mother-of-one said she was wracked with guilt for not being able to save Huber, despite her heroic efforts, and asked his family for forgiveness.</p>

<p>'I tried so hard to save him. I feel devastated and sick to my stomach that I could not,' she said. </p>

<p>'I feel they might blame me that I couldn't save their son. I wanted to try to reassure them that I felt like I did everything that was in my power to give him CPR until somebody more qualified than me could take the reins.</p>

<p>'I thought if I could bring him back and just make him breathe, perhaps he could have a fighting chance.'</p>

<p>The Kenosha protests were fueled by a police shooting of Jacob Blake, 29, on August 23.</p>

<p>Seven-year Kenosha PD veteran Rusten Sheskey shot Blake seven times in the back during an arrest, leaving him paralyzed.</p>

<p>Sheskey, 31, has been put on administrative leave while Wisconsin officials investigate the confrontation caught on video.</p>

<p>The Blake family attorney, Benjamin Crump, said it would take a 'miracle' for Blake to recover use of his legs.</p>

<p>'The medical diagnosis right now is that he is paralyzed, because those bullets severed his spinal cord,' he said at a press conference last Tuesday.</p>

<p>'He will need a miracle to walk again. He is currently in surgery as we speak, to try and save his life. And return to some semblance of the man he once was.' </p>

'It was terrible to see this gentleman pretty much dead and to see her frantic and trying to get to see her boyfriend. It's a scene I'll never forget'</p>

<p>Badoni said she attended the protest on Tuesday because she disagreed with the Kenosha officer's actions.</p>

<p>'I was just interested in a peaceful protest,' she said. 'I was very against Jacob Blake getting shot seven times, I thought that was very excessive.</p>

<p>'I wouldn't want to be in a police officer's shoes, with what they were dealing with at that time: he wasn't listening to commands, there was a knife in the car. But for him to be shot that many times it seems kind of crazy and very excessive.'</p>

<p>The former servicewoman said she learned her CPR skills in a police science degree and in first responder training with the Red Cross and with the Daytona police.</p>

<p>'I knew what to do, so all I could think of was 'God, I need to help this gentleman. If I can somehow save him, if I can somehow make him breathe, then medical professionals can take it from there'.</p>

<p>'I didn't care if I got shot, all I wanted to do was help this gentleman.</p>

<p>'I don't care if it was a white person or a black person on the ground, I don't care who it is,' she added. 'I would have run through that gunfire and helped whoever was on the ground, and I would do it again.</p>

<p>'In that situation you don't think about yourself, all you think about is trying to help somebody else. That's how I was raised, to do whatever you can for another person.'</p>
