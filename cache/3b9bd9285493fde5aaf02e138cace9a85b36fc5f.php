<p>Charged: Emily Good was arrested after filming police officers</p>

<p>A woman who filmed police officers from her own front garden was arrested after she refused to put her camera down.</p>

<p>Emily Good found herself in handcuffs after filming police arresting a man just outside her New York home.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old was charged with obstructing governmental administration after officers say she refused the police officer's order to leave her front yard and go inside.</p>

<p>Her arrest in Rochester, New York, has sparked a media frenzy over the filming of police officers.</p>

<p>Miss Good's video, illuminated by police sirens, begins by showing a man being questioned by a police officer at about 10 p.m.</p>

<p>'I just got out of the house, man, I'm sick, man', the man who has been pulled over can be heard saying.</p>

<p>He is led away in handcuffs and one of the officers then turns towards the camera and asks: 'You guys need something?'</p>

<p>I'm just, this is my front yard, I'm just recording what you're doing. It's my right,' Miss Good replies.</p>

<p>Caught on camera: Emily Good's video captures traffic police handcuffing their suspect</p>

<p>'Actually, not from the sidewalk,' the officer replies.</p>

<p>The video, uploaded to the Internet this week, more than a month after Miss Good's May 12 arrests, has raised questions over whether she was within her rights to film or should have listened to police and gone inside her home.</p>

<p>Rochester Police Union President Mike Mazzeo said the officer in question repeatedly told Miss Good he felt threatened by her presence.</p>

<p>'I see an officer using great restraint, maintaining composure, acting professional, clearly giving very clear and concise orders to an individual who just simply didn't comply.</p>

<p>Caught: The moment officer's realise they are being filmed and start to question Miss Good</p>

<p>Mr Mazzeo says what can't be ignored is the danger police find themselves in on a daily basis and says the fact that she's on her property is insignificant.</p>

<p>'I think she was certainly trying to engage the officers, in my opinion, and that's what's so dangerous because it's a distraction to what these officers are doing,' he added.</p>

<p>Led away: the film shows the officers treatment of their suspect</p>

<p>The police chief has ordered an internal investigation of the incident.</p>

<p>Mr Mazzeo says the officer told him Miss Good claimed to know the man that was being frisked in the video.</p>

<p>He says because she claimed to have an association with the man, the officer had further reason to be concerned about her demeanour.</p>

<p>The police chief pointed out that no formal complaint has been made by Miss Good.</p>

<p>Her lawyers says itâ€™s because Miss Good has been researching a possible civil claim.</p>
