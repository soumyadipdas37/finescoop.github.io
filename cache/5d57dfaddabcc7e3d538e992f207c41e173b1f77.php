<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Victorian father's hilariously accurate impression of Premier Daniel Andrews at a press conference has taken social media by storm. </p>

<p>Father-of-three Tim Penhalluriack posted a four-minute video of himself pretending to be Victorian Premier to Facebook on Monday, where it has since amassed more than 80,000 views. </p>

<p>In the video, Mr Penhalluriack wore a blue suit and glasses to imitate Mr Andrew's signature look while recreating some of his most recognisable mannerisms. </p>

<p>'Are we good to go? Great,' he said at the start of the video, referencing how the Premier often kicks off his daily press conferences. </p>

<p>Even Mr Andrews himself is in on this joke, as his current profile picture is captioned: 'Everyone right to go?'</p>

<p>Continuing his impression, Mr Penhalluriack then proceeded to jokingly criticise Melbourne's current Stage 4 lockdown. </p>

<p>'Can I start by saying, the vast majority of Victorians - the vast majority - are following the advice, following the rules,' Mr Penhalluriack continued. </p>

<p>'I'd firstly like to extend my thanks and my gratitude to those Victorians and of course to our heroes in the frontline, our frontline workers, our healthcare workers. </p>

<p>'In fact, they're pretty much the only workers that we have here in Victoria at the moment because of me and my restrictions.'   </p>

<p>In the video, Mr Penhalluriack exaggerated some of Mr Andrew's tendencies by taking long dramatic pauses as he looked down at his paper and fixed his glasses. </p>

<p>A camera shutter sound can even be heard in the background in a bid to imitate a real press conference.   </p>

<p>'If you wish to gather together in groups or get your mates around and continue to get on the beers, if you fail to socially distance, you'll be caught,' he continued. </p>

<p>The father was referencing Mr Andrew's famous 'get on the beers' quote from March, which has since been remixed into a song by DJ duo Mashd N Kutcher.   </p>

<p>Mr Penhalluriack jokingly criticised Melbourne's Stage 4 lockdown, saying healthcare workers are 'pretty much the only workers that we have here in Victoria at the moment because of me and my restrictions'</p>

<p>But Mr Penhalluriack then delved into conspiracy-theory territory when he suggested that elderly Australians in nursing home are actually dying of 'complications totally unrelated to COVID-19'. </p>

<p>He falsely claimed there are 'significant financial incentives for families' to have coronavirus listed on their loved one's death certificates. </p>

<p>Earlier this month, a rumour that a family was offered $9,000 by a nursing home to put coronavirus as the cause of death on their elderly father's death certificate began circulating on social media.</p>

<p>The rumour also suggested nursing homes were being paid $25,000 by the Australian Government for each COVID-related death.   </p>

<p>However, an AFP fact check has since debunked this rumour as completely false.  </p>

<p>Mr Penhalluriack then finished off the video with a cheeky dig at the way politicians dodge questions. </p>

<p>'Are there any questions that I can side-step, perhaps? And perhaps not answer properly as so as to further frustrate the Victorian people,' he concluded. </p>

<p>The video comes as Victoria recorded 90 new COVID-19 cases and six deaths on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>There are 2,415 active cases across the state, including 1,177 cases in aged care facilities and 35 cases in disability care settings. </p>

<p>Melburnians are currently in their fifth week of Stage 4 lockdown, which is set to last six weeks unless it is extended. </p>
