<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Climate change could trigger the spread of potentially fatal mosquito-borne diseases around Africa and beyond, a new study shows. </p>

<p>Disease-carrying mosquito species, such as the aedes aegypti or yellow fever mosquito, are attracted to the excess heat caused by climate change.  </p>

<p>US researchers have predicted when and where in Sub-Saharan Africa malaria will decrease and other mosquito-borne diseases will rise. </p>

<p>They also warn of 'public health disaster' if the continent fails to focus on strategies tailored to mosquito-borne diseases other than malaria. </p>

<p>They highlight that different species of the flying pest thrive at various temperature ranges and transmit different diseases. </p>

<p>The anopheles gambiae mosquito transmits malaria to humans, but aedes aegypti is also a huge threat and transmits several different viruses, including the dengue virus. </p>

<p>An aedes aegypti, also known as the the yellow fever mosquito. It can that can spread dengue fever, chikungunya, Zika fever, Mayaro and yellow fever viruses</p>

<p>'Climate change is going to rearrange the landscape of infectious disease,' said Stanford biologist and study lead author Erin Mordecai. </p>

<p>'Chikungunya and dengue outbreaks like we've recently seen in East Africa are only becoming more likely across much of the continent. </p>

<p>'We need to be ready for this emerging threat.' </p>

<p>The nighttime-biting Anopheles gambiae mosquito transmits malaria, a disease that affects more than 200 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa, and killed more than 400,000 people there in 2018. </p>

<p>Public health efforts in the region have already tried to tackle malaria with insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor spraying, among other measures. </p>

<p>The anopheles gambiae mosquito (pictured) transmits malaria to humans, but the aedes aegypti is also a huge threat and transmits several different diseases</p>

<p>But these control strategies do little to combat the daytime-biting aedes aegypti mosquito, commonly known as the yellow fever mosquito.</p>

<p>Aedes aegypti can transmit a range of devastating diseases, such as Rift Valley Fever, Zika, chikungunya and dengue, as well as yellow fever.</p>

<p>Growing urbanisation has expanded aedes aegypti's range by enlarging its preferred breeding grounds, including human-made containers such as discarded tires, cans, buckets and water storage jugs. </p>

<p>In contrast, malaria-transmitting mosquitoes breed in naturally occurring pools of water more common in rural areas. </p>

<p>Expanding urban areas also form 'heat islands' that are several degrees warmer than surrounding vegetated areas, which is attractive to the warm weather-loving aedes aegypti. </p>

<p>Past research has found that warmer temperatures increase transmission of vector-borne disease up to an optimum temperature or 'turn-over point'.</p>

<p>Above this point, disease transmission slows. </p>

<p>But just as they carry different diseases, different mosquitoes are adapted to varying temperatures. </p>

<p>Malaria is most likely to spread at 78°F (25°C), while the risk of the viral infection dengue is highest at 84°F (29°C). </p>

<p>As a result, a warming world means more dengue, which causes rashes, severe headaches and pain behind the eyes.</p>

<p>2019 was the worst year on record for the disease, which is often life threatening, with cases in every region.</p>

<p>This included some countries that had never seen dengue, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). </p>

<p>Before 1970, only nine countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics, but the disease is now endemic in more than 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.  </p>

<p>In Sub-Saharan Africa, the shift toward mosquitoes that carry diseases other than malaria is likely to accelerate with climate change, according to Mordecai and her colleagues. </p>

<p>Warming could increase the number of malaria-carrying mosquitoes in relatively cool places, such as highlands.</p>

<p>However, it is also likely to decrease their numbers in warmer lowland zones, such as Accra, Ghana, while increasing the number of mosquitoes that carry dengue and other diseases.</p>

<p>Some places will get a double whammy, according to the study.</p>

<p>For both malaria and dengue, areas around Lake Victoria, such as the cities of Kisumu in Kenya and Entebbe in Uganda, will become high risk by 2050.</p>

<p>Fumigation of mosquitoes to pevent disease outbreak. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the shift toward mosquitoes that carry diseases other than malaria is likely to accelerate with climate change</p>

<p>That risk will spread west to areas including the cities of Mbarara in Uganda and Mwanza in Tanzania. </p>

<p>'It's vital to focus on controlling mosquitoes that spread diseases like dengue because there are no medical treatments for these diseases,' said study senior author Desiree LaBeaud. </p>

<p>'On top of that, a shift from malaria to dengue may overwhelm health systems because diseases introduced to new populations often lead to large outbreaks.'</p>

<p>As has been done in the Americas, new public health efforts in Sub-Saharan Africa to target aedes aegypti and dengue, chikungunya and other viruses need to be added to existing malaria control measures, the researchers argue. </p>

<p>Community-based mosquito control, such as rubbish removal and covering of standing water will be increasingly important basic prevention measures.             </p>

<p>The study has been published in Lancet Planetary Health. </p>

<p>Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. </p>

<p>It is caught by people visiting or living in Asia, the Caribbean, and North, South or Central America.</p>

<p>Mosquitoes in the UK do not spread the virus. </p>

<p>In most cases, the infection is mild and passes in around a week.</p>

<p>Symptoms usually include:</p>

<p>There is no cure or specific treatment. </p>

<p>Patients can relieve their symptoms via painkillers, staying hydrated and resting.</p>

<p>In rare cases, dengue symptoms can develop into severe dengue.</p>

<p>Elderly patients, or those with other medical conditions, are most at risk. </p>

<p>Severe dengue fever symptoms can include:</p>

<p>Severe dengue is usually treated via a blood and platelet transfusion, IV fluids for rehydration and oxygen therapy if levels are low. </p>
