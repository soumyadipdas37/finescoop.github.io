<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Big Narstie has had to pull out of a high-profile government scheme to attract visitors to Britain because he failed to quarantine after flying back from Spain.</p>

<p>The rapper, 34, was filming a promo video in the Yorkshire Dales for Visit Britain, when he realised he should have been isolation at home after his party holiday.</p>

<p>Big Narstie had been joined by a film crew in picturesque Malham, which featured as a location in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, for a government-funded advert.</p>

<p>Oops! Big Narstie has had to pull out of a high-profile Government scheme to attract visitors to Britain because he failed to quarantine after flying back from Spain</p>

<p>But after Big Narstie - real name Tyrone Lino - had been filmed praising the local attractions, such as a waterfall known as Janet's Foss, and dining in a local gastropub, producers realised that the rapper should have been in quarantine and promptly ended filming.</p>

<p>Visit Britain has had to bin the footage, while the agency behind the promo video Gravity Road are looking for another artist for a reshoot.</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Big Narstie's representatives for comment.  </p>

<p>Oh dear: The rapper, 34, was filming a promo video in the Yorkshire Dales for Visit Britain, when he realised he should have been isolation at home after his party holiday</p>

<p>Having a blast: Just days before arriving in the Yorkshire Dales he posted a couple of videos on his TikTok profile partying in Spain</p>

<p>The grime artist and funnyman hosts the Channel 4 chat show The Big Narstie Show and as well as his musical achievements has appeared on Celebrity Juice and Would I Lie to You?</p>

<p>Just days before arriving in the Yorkshire Dales he posted a couple of videos on his TikTok profile partying in Spain.</p>

<p>Big Nastie commented on Instagram: 'Yo people Just to let everyone know that no matter what anyone tells you you HAVE to quarantine when you come back into the UK. </p>

<p>'I made a mistake thinking that the corona test I took abroad and then took another one when I came back made me exempt from quarantining but I was WRONG and now I'm in quarantine for 2 weeks so the moral of the story is Quarantine is REEEAAALL even if you've had a corona test.'</p>

<p>A VisitBritain spokesperson said: 'We were made aware that an individual contracted by a creative agency for a VisitBritain campaign had not followed official UK Government guidance on self-isolating after returning from a country currently on the quarantine list.</p>

<p>'Our understanding is that this individual is now quarantining and no further filming is taking place with them on this campaign. </p>

<p>'As we are unable to use this footage in our campaign, the creative agency who is contracted to provide this film are now working to secure replacement footage.'</p>

<p>Success: The grime artist and funnyman hosts the Channel 4 chat show The Big Narstie Show and as well as his musical achievements (pictured in March 2019)</p>
