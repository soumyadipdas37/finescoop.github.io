<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Colour experts at Pantone have unveiled a new shade of red – called Period – in a bid to break the stigma around menstruation.</p>

<p>The firm said it hopes the 'active and adventurous hue' would 'encourage period positivity' and 'embolden people who menstruate to feel proud of who they are'. </p>

<p>It developed the 'energising and dynamic' red with the Swedish firm Intimina, which declared the colour is an 'original shade... that represents a steady flow'.</p>

<p>Colour experts at Pantone have created a new shade of red called Period with the Swedish firm Intimina</p>

<p>ActionAid, which works with women and girls living in poverty, has received a £2,000 donation from Intimina to coincide with the new colour's launch. </p>

<p>The charity's UK director of policy, Jillian Popkins, said: 'Millions still suffer due to the stigma associated with periods. </p>

<p>Many girls miss vital days of school, or even drop out, which is one reason so many women experience life-long poverty globally. </p>

<p>Without the stigma around periods, more women could escape poverty, fulfil their potential and strengthen their communities.'</p>

<p>Others were less welcoming – and warned the stunt could backfire. Broadcaster Vanessa Feltz said the 'well-meaning' but 'ridiculous' introduction of 'Period red' could make menstruation 'seem more significant, and maybe ominous'.</p>

<p>She added: 'Menstrual blood is just blood. </p>

<p>'It's exactly the same if you have a nosebleed or fall over and cut your knee... demystifying that would be far better than labelling it in that very odd way.'</p>
