<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Facebook and car maker Ford have joined the UN's campaign to reach net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2050. </p>

<p>'Race To Zero' is an international campaign 'for a zero-carbon world', where carbon emissions are balanced by carbon that's removed from the atmosphere. </p>

<p>The campaign's partners, which need to meet a set of criteria, are tasked with 'accelerating net-zero carbon emission commitments', including taking immediate action to achieve net zero emissions. </p>

<p>Achieving net zero by 2050 'at the very latest' is in line with the scientific consensus on limiting warming to 2.7°F (1.5°C), set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015. </p>

<p>Facebook itself has already made promises to stamp out carbon emissions from its own operations, but the new partnership commits the social network to adhering with the UN's climate goals.  </p>

<p>Facebook is among the supporters of the Race To Zero campaign, the largest alliance of local governments, businesses and investors aiming for zero emissions in the 2040s</p>

<p>The announcement comes ahead of the 26th annual United Nations Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, which will be held in Glasgow in November. </p>

<p>'Those involved in the Race to Zero have made a commitment to build that future and to achieve specific goals and will be held to those promises,' said Patricia Espinosa, executive secretary of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. </p>

<p>'The world cannot afford to be let down, nor can this campaign become something that allows nations to defer action until a later date. </p>

<p>'It’s about needing more climate ambition and climate action now – in 2020.' </p>

<p>The UN's Race to Zero initiative is backed by 22 regions, 452 cities, 1,128 businesses, 549 universities and 1,100 businesses.  </p>

<p>Other new Race for Zero partners include PayPal, Mastercard, Mercedes-Benz, the world’s largest cement company LafargeHolcim and CP Group, a Thai conglomerate and one of the world's largest agri-food producers. </p>

<p>'As the global leader in our industry, LafargeHolcim has a key role to play to address today’s climate crisis,' said LafargeHolcim CEO Jan Jenisch. </p>

<p>'That’s why we are proud to announce our net zero pledge with science-based targets to accelerate green construction and the transition to a net zero world.' </p>

<p>The campaign aims to bring together net zero commitments from cities, businesses and investors across the climate action community. </p>

<p>Its objective is to build momentum around the shift to a decarbonized economy ahead of COP26 in November, where governments 'must strengthen their contributions to the Paris Agreement', the UN says.  </p>

<p>Between 2015 and 2021 the government expects to invest more than £2.5 billion in research and development of low carbon energy technologies – such as those involving wind and solar – transport, agriculture, and waste </p>

<p>Value chain includes emissions from suppliers and other factors such as employee commuting and business travel</p>

<p>Facebook itself has recently committed to reaching net zero emissions throughout its value chain by 2030 – meaning emissions of greenhouse gases will be offset by its operations.  </p>

<p>Also last week, it launched the Climate Science Information Centre – a dedicated webpage on the site that collects resources from climate experts, including the UN. </p>

<p>Now, Facebook's decision to join Race To Zero demonstrates 'clear momentum behind the shift towards a decarbonised economy', according to the UK government. </p>

<p>'Climate change affects every single one of us and we all have a part to play to champion climate action ahead of Cop26,' said UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Alok Sharma, who is also president of COP26.</p>

<p>'Through the Energy Transition Council and the UK's ambitious climate finance commitments, I hope to drive the transition to cleaner energies, and I urge all businesses, cities and regions to join the Race To Zero coalition.' </p>

<p>Business Secretary Alok Sharma, who will announce Ford and Facebook have joined the campaign to reach net-zero carbon emissions</p>

<p>Sharma is to speak at a special event on Monday, alongside political and industry leaders about the next decade of clean energy co-operation, to mark the first day of Climate Week NYC on Monday. </p>

<p>Sharma is also set to launch the UN Climate Change Conference's Energy Transition Council, to bring together leaders to speed up the transition from coal to renewables in developing countries.</p>

<p>The UK will chair the council alongside Damilola Ogunbiyi, the UN Secretary General's Special Representative for Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL).</p>

<p>It comes after the UK Government announced a new £50 million investment in a new Clean Energy Innovation Facility (CEIF).</p>

<p>CEIF help developing countries get easier access to innovative clean energy technologies, focusing on key sectors such as industry, cooling, smart energy and storage.</p>

<p>Between 2015 and 2021 the government expects to invest more than £2.5 billion in research and development of low carbon energy technologies – such as those involving wind and solar – transport, agriculture, and waste. </p>

<p>The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.</p>

<p>It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.</p>

<p>It seems the more ambitious goal of restricting global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) may be more important than ever, according to previous research which claims 25 per cent of the world could see a significant increase in drier conditions.</p>

<p>In June 2017, President Trump announced his intention for the US, the second largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world, to withdraw from the agreement.  </p>

<p>The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:</p>

<p>1)  A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels</p>

<p>2) To aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change</p>

<p>3) Goverments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries</p>

<p>4) To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science</p>
