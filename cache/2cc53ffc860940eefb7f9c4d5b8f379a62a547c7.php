<p>Posting in the Facebook group, Feeding a family on £1 a day, Drew (pictured) shared her meal plan, revealing she shops at Tesco Online, to get the bargain prices</p>

<p>'So the last few weeks I've seen a lot of people struggling with their budget for feeding their families and asking for cheap meal ideas. It makes me a little sad that some people are really struggling so much so I want to try and help.</p>

<p>'I'm in no way master chef, but I like to do something close to a home cooked meal every day plus something fairly nutritional for lunches and breakfasts. I feed a family of four (two adults two children) and I try to keep the cost down myself.</p>

<p>'I've put together a four week "standard meal plan" which is based a lot around the kind of foods my children like,' she wrote.    </p>

<p>'I understand not everyone will like everything on this list and i know there's other ways of doing the meals I have put on here, I've simply done for the cheaper ways to help families that are struggling to have tasty meals for a cheaper price. </p>

<p>Drew managed to cook up 84 meals and desserts with her budget of £164, including a spicy beef baguette (pictured)</p>

<p>Drew's delicious desserts include cheesecake (left) and sponge cupcakes (right) which she bakes up on a Sunday for the week </p>

<p>Drew also makes homemade scotch eggs (pictured) for her family as one of the many meals she bakes up</p>

<p>Pictured is the mouthwatering chocolate cake cooked up by Drew for her family. She makes three desserts a week to stick to her budget</p>

<p>Drew shared her meal plan to the Facebook group to help other parents on a budget make meals (pictured)</p>

<p>Drew also posted her shopping list with a breakdown of how much each item cost, with a total  budget of £164.25</p>

<p>'I have also gone for the cheaper ingredients in most cases, so please no bashing, I'm just hoping to help.</p>

<p>'I also understand people have different size portions so I went for a general size that would feed my family.</p>

<p>Drew added her tips would be to 'bulk out the ingredients wherever you can'.</p>

<p>She also said she has a baking day once a week to premake the desserts for the week ahead.  </p>

<p>Drew also made a chicken roast and a pork roast (pictured) which she served with chips and peas</p>

<p>Drew also made dauphinoise potatoes for her children, and has a slightly different plan every week </p>

<p>Drew also whipped up a sponge cake for her children, which she managed to whip up within her budget of £164</p>

<p>'The total shopping list for a month [28 days] here is £164.25 which works out at £1.47 a day per head, for breakfast, lunches, desserts and dinners. </p>

<p>The post quickly racked up hundreds of likes with dozens thanking Drew for her insight.</p>

<p>'This is amazing! So helpful for sticking to a budget and can adapt recipes! It’s a great menu,' wrote one.  </p>

<p>'This is incredible, just the meal plan alone is a great help as I struggle with ideas for food and I just have me and a 1 year old,' added another.</p>

<p>'How lovely of you. Really appreciate this as have been struggling for meal ideas for a month and really do need to keep the cost down,' commented a third. </p>
