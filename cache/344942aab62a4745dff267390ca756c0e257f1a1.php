<p>The United youngster has remained silent following the removal of his Twitter presence, whilst Phil Foden has responded to the incident earlier on Monday.</p>

<p>Writing via Twitter on Monday evening, Foden said: 'Following the story which has emerged today regarding my actions in Iceland, I want to make a full apology.</p>

<p>Foden took to social media on Monday evening to issue a full apology to everybody involved</p>

<p>'I apologise to Gareth Southgate, to my England team mates, to the staff, supporters, and also to my Club and family.</p>

<p>'I am a young player with a lot to learn, but I am aware of the huge responsibility I have in representing Manchester City and England at this level.</p>

<p>'On this occasion I made a poor decision and my behaviour didn't meet the standards expected of me.</p>

<p>'I breached COVID-19 protocols put in place to protect myself and my England colleagues. As a consequence I will now miss the opportunity to travel to Denmark with the squad, and that hurts.' </p>

<p>One of the women was videoed while on the phone to Foden and Greenwood, making plans</p>
