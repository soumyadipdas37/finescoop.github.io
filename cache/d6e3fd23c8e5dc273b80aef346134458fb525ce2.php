<p>CCTV footage captured at a Caltex service station in Dee Why, on Sydney's Northern Beaches, shows a number of the 40 riders tumble to the ground </p>

<p>He has pleaded guilty to two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and two counts of intentionally or recklessly destroy or damage property. </p>

<p>But the 26-year-old has denied his actions were deliberate and is fighting a charge of intentionally throw object at vehicle. </p>

<p>The court heard Maartensz had allegedly been drinking for 12 hours in the lead up to the moment caught on camera at about 5.40am.</p>

<p>Maartensz admitted the man depicted on tape was him but claimed he was simply giving his friend Brad Riddington a ride when he lost control of the trolley.</p>

<p>Maartensz admitted the man depicted on tape was him but claimed he was simply giving his friend Brad Riddington a ride when he lost control of the trolley </p>

<p>He said he tried to pull the trolley back as it slipped down the service station driveway - but it was too late.   </p>

<p>Maartensz told the court he had no idea the cyclists were travelling towards them until the trolley hit them.  </p>

<p>His friend who was inside the trolley said he hadn't noticed until the cyclists were on top of him. </p>

<p>The cyclists from Manly Warringah Cycling Club were using lights while travelling at 42km/hour along the busy road before sunrise.</p>

<p>Their lights picked up something moving towards them on the left hand side but it was too late to take action.</p>

<p>Vision was captured outside the Caltex service station (pictured) in Dee Why on Sydney's Northern Beaches</p>

<p>Cyclist Chris Taylor told the court the alleged actions did not appear to be an accident. </p>

<p>'He was head down, with the trolley and he was running at us,' Mr Taylor said.</p>

<p>'We were yelling ''no, no, no,''. He just kept his head down and ploughed into us.'  </p>

<p>Prosecutor Sgt Chris O'Brien agreed the CCTV footage proved the alleged actions appeared deliberate.</p>

<p>The case will return to court on December 4.  </p>
