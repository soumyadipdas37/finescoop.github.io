<p>'I still have a little PTSD': Keith Urban (pictured in January 2018), 52, recalled the struggle of being locked down in Nashville for three months amid the coronavirus pandemic, in an interview with Australian newspaper The Sunday Telegraph's Stellar magazine</p>

<p>The comments were made in relation to Keith's single Out The Cage from his new album, that was written in June, three months into lockdown.</p>

<p>Out The Cage explores the feelings that come with being in lockdown - being confined, missing socialisation and the loss of freedom. </p>

<p>'We'd been in lockdown since March. I was ready to get out and do things, I poured it into that song. I still have a little PTSD about lockdown,' Keith told Stellar magazine.</p>

<p>The four-time Grammy Award-winner is now based in Byron Bay, Australia where wife Nicole is busy filming her $100million series Nine Perfect Strangers.</p>

<p>'We're in Byron Bay now and all I can think about is Nashville not that long ago,' Keith went on to say. 'I'm like a little caged animal timidly walking around going, "I don't know about this freedom, this feels a little fishy".' </p>

<p>Keith wed Nicole, 53, in 2006, and they share daughters Sunday Rose, 12, and Faith Margaret, nine.</p>

<p>The One: The singer-songwriter told CBS News in May 2016 that his life truly began when he met the Academy Award-winner: 'It was literally, like, "OK, life starts"' </p>

<p>'[Meeting Nicole] and getting married wasn't life-changing, it was life-beginning,' he said. 'It was literally, like, "OK, life starts".'  </p>

<p>Keith, who met Nicole at the 2005 G'Day USA gala, later revealed how it took him four months to muster up the courage to call her after meeting at the gala event. </p>

<p>'I'd never have thought she'd see anything in a guy like me,' he admitted to Australian TV show Interview in 2018.</p>

<p>'But at some point I plucked up the courage to call those numbers and she answered, and we started talking and we talked and talked and talked and talked and it was effortless.'  </p>
