<p>'It's cute, but it's so wrong': Rebecca Judd revealed on her KIIS FM radio show on Monday the one swear word her son Darcy, three, can't stop saying</p>

<p>'He says it all the time. It's kind of cute, but it's so wrong,' Bec said on the show, with a laugh.</p>

<p>'My husband and I have been having some chats at home about what words warrant being a swear word or not. When I was a kid, every rude word was a swear word... even shut up,' Bec said. </p>

<p>She said her four children, who she shares with AFL star husband Chris Judd, are now watching The Simpsons a lot, so have been saying some cheeky words at home. </p>

<p>But she said Darcy can't stop saying 'bast***' after hearing her fire up while playing Mario Kart. </p>

<p>'I've been playing a lot of Mario Kart at home and since going to my friend Nicole Slater's house... she has this talking parrot that says, "oh you bast***, oh you bast***." </p>

<p>'So now when someone bumps me when playing Mario Kart I say, "oh you bast***," Bec said.</p>

<p>'I've got this parrot in my head! So my youngest Darcy, one of my twins has picked up on the bast*** word and won't stop saying it!'</p>

<p>Bec then said that she wasn't sure if it is a swear word or not. </p>

<p>Oops! But she said Darcy can't stop saying 'bast***' after hearing her fire up while playing Mario Kart</p>

<p>She added that she had a conversation with Darcy recently about what being a twin is, when he said he thought it was 'being a bast***.'</p>

<p>Bec's radio co-host Katie 'Monty' Dimond said she thought it was a bit full on that a three year old was swearing.   </p>

<p>'As cute as that sounds, hearing bast*** coming out of a kid's mouth is pretty full on isn't it?' Monty said.  </p>

<p>Rebecca and her husband, retired AFL star Chris Judd, have been in lockdown in Melbourne with their four children, son Oscar, nine, daughter Billie, six, and twins Tom and Darcy.</p>

<p>It came after her twins trashed her stylish living room. </p>

<p>'I'm done... I'm out,' Bec said.</p>

<p>Bec explained that she's been researching holiday destinations in Australia, tossing up the idea of Darwin, Perth, NSW, and Noosa. </p>
