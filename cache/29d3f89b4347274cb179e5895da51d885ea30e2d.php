<p>These Aibrou Women's Jogger Pants are a favourite among Amazon shoppers thanks to their soft and comfortable design</p>

<p>Made from an ultra-soft and lightweight cotton, the £12.99 joggers are tapered, have an elastic drawstring waistband and pockets, and feature contrasting white stripes down the sides.</p>

<p>And while the comfy bottoms are ideal for wearing at home, they are also cute enough to wear outside the house too, whether you're hitting the gym or running errands. Pair them with a white tee and trainers for the ultimate 90s cool-girl look.</p>

<p>They have a near-perfect average star rating from over 1,100 shoppers who praise the Aibrou Womens Jogger Pants, describing them as 'the best joggers ever'. It's no surprise they rank highly in Amazon's Women's Sports Trousers category.</p>

<p>A third shopper added: 'Lovely and breathable, I am a very small woman 5ft too about 5'2 and I need a medium as I have a wide waist, but the trouble is the leg was rather long. </p>

<p>'But I basically live in them now as they are so comfy and are practical because of their deep pockets!'</p>

<p>The popular joggers are machine washable at 40 degrees and ranges in size from S to XXL. And they won't break the bank either as they cost as little as £12.99 depending on the size and colour you select.</p>
