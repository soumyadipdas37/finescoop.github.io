<p>Jurgen Klopp's side were outstanding prior to the pausing of the season in March, losing just once as they surged towards a first league title win in 30 years.</p>

<p>The Brazilian saved a penalty from Jorginho as Liverpool won 2-0 at Chelsea last weekend</p>

<p>This was less than both Manchester clubs, as well as Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea.</p>

<p>Liverpool have started the new season with back-to-back victories - a thrilling 4-3 win over Leeds and a more composed 2-0 success at Chelsea - and their Brazilian keeper says they've getting back to their best.</p>

<p>'We know that we dropped a little bit, we don't know why,' Alisson told Sky Sports ahead of Monday's meeting with Arsenal.</p>

<p>The 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge was especially satisfying for Alisson, who added: 'I like the intensity of the game, I like the way we defended also. I what I like was our mentality on that game.</p>

<p>'I think we are on the right path again.'</p>

<p>Arsenal defeated Liverpool 2-1 at the Emirates Stadium back in July and Mikel Arteta's side also won the Community Shield on penalties last month.</p>

<p>Alisson said: 'You can see they are playing together, really well organised in the defensive phase and they have fantastic strikers with really good quality.</p>
