<p>Delighted: Sharing snaps from the low-key celebration via Instagram, Christine gushed: 'Our little girl is the big 2 already!'</p>

<p>Her favourite: Patricia greeted with five gifts that were covered with Peppa Pig wrapping paper, and she also got a delectable cake with the iconic cartoon on the front</p>

<p>Adorable: Christine and Frank made sure to surprise Patricia by decorating their home with an array of adorable animal balloons as well as ones adorned with Peppa Pig characters</p>

<p>As well as sharing Patricia with Frank, Christine is also step-mum to his daughters Luna, 15, and Isla, 13, who he shares with ex Elen Rivas. </p>

<p>Frank and Christine first crossed paths at the Pride Of Britain awards in 2009, and Christine has previously said she and Frank were not meant to be at the award show on the night they met.</p>

<p>Speaking on Lorraine in October, Christine said: 'It’s a strange one, because it is ten years ago that we met at them, it was one of those nights that neither of us were meant to go to.</p>

<p>'It was a last minute thing for him and I arrived at the awards late because of work. We were sat on tables next to each other.'</p>

<p>Tuck in: Finishing off the fun celebration, Christine also ordered a tray full of chocolate cupcakes that were shaped like hearts and topped with other sweet treats</p>

<p>Family: As well as sharing Patricia with Frank, Christine is also step-mum to his daughters Luna, 15, and Isla, 13, (pictured) who he shares with ex Elen Rivas</p>

<p>Christine added that Piers Morgan got some credit for introducing her to Frank as he 'did do an introduction', and joked: 'He was there at that moment so I can’t actually take that away from him.'</p>

<p>The TV personality went on to gush over Frank's skills as a father to Patricia, as she praised: 'He is very good, he has to be directed a little bit, I suppose, but he's great. He's so brilliant with her.' </p>

<p>In 2015, Christine spoke candidly about being a step-mum to Isla and Luna, saying that while it was a tough role to take on she was keen to dispel old notions of the 'evil step-mother'.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Times she explained that building a bond with his children had been a careful 'well-thought-out process', as she said: 'I'd like to think, if you asked the girls in ten years' time, they would say that it was a well-thought-out process - I didn't meet them for a year, on purpose.'</p>

<p>Meant to be: The couple first crossed paths at the 2009 Pride Of Britain awards, and Christine previously said they were not meant to be at the event the night they met (pictured in October)</p>

<p>Taking their time: Christine said she and Frank waited until they were sure of their long-term feelings for each other before she was introduced to Isla and Luna (pictured in 2015)</p>

<p>Wanting to be careful of disrupting their lives, Christine added that she and Frank waited until they were sure of their long-term feelings for each other, before introducing her into Isla and Luna's lives. </p>

<p>Of how she spent time with them during this period, Christine went on: 'Frank's away a lot, their mummy could be away, I have them on my own. </p>

<p>'It's me going to violin recitals, me doing their homework, me doing the bathtime tonight and getting them to school in the morning - I've grown into that and we have our own little system.</p>

<p>'They know I'm their little mate. I don't want to be their mummy. That was never even a thought.'   </p>

<p> Caring: After being in their lives for several years by 2015, Christine said of their bond, 'They know I'm their little mate. I don't want to be their mummy. That was never even a thought'</p>

<p>Christine has also previously said being a step-mum to her husband's children helped prepare her for motherhood.</p>

<p>She told Lorraine in July 2018: 'I have had the girls since they were four and two and they are 13 and 11 so I have been through all the toddler years, the primary and secondary school bit and teenagers are around the corner, that is preparation, although the baby years is all new to me! </p>

<p>'So I’ll take it day by day really, like every other new mum. People are telling me, and I would like to think I’m like that anyway, but do your best to relax into it and don’t put too much pressure on yourself.'</p>

<p>'Don’t always be looking at everyone else and thinking, "It’s running perfectly for them, why isn’t it for me?" Give yourself a break. I’ll take it hour by hour!' </p>

<p>Helpful: Christine has also previously said being a step-mum to her husband's children helped prepare her for motherhood as she had known them since they were four and two</p>
