<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Naomi Osaka marched into the semi-finals of the US Open with a commanding straight-sets win over Shelby Rogers.</p>

<p>The Japanese star, looking to regain the title she won in 2018, was a 6-3 6-4 winner in the Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>

<p>It means Osaka remains on course for a potential blockbuster final against Serena Williams, a repeat of the controversial finale of two years ago.</p>

<p>Naomi Osaka barely celebrated after a routine win over Shelby Rogers to advance </p>

<p>She is through to the US Open semi-final after beating 6-3 6-4 in Arthur Ashe stadium</p>

<p>Osaka won that acrimonious encounter after Williams' infamous argument with umpire Carlos Ramos. Two years on, the American is still waiting to claim her record-equalling 24th grand slam title.</p>

<p>With the women's draw decimated by withdrawals and shock defeats Williams and Osaka, the third and fourth seeds respectively, look destined to meet again on Saturday.</p>

<p>The next-highest ranked player left is Elise Mertens, the world number 18 from Belgium.</p>

<p>Williams takes on unseeded Tsvetana Pironkova in the quarter-final later on Wednesday, while Osaka will meet American 28th seed Jennifer Brady in the semis.</p>

<p>Osaka credited her positive attitude and said revenge was a key motivating factor </p>

<p>Osaka walked onto court wearing a mask bearing the name of George Floyd, the black man whose death at the hands of police sparked anti-racism protests across the world.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old has seven masks with victims' names in total, so she clearly plans to reach the final.</p>

<p>Osaka had lost her previous three meetings with Rogers but was in no mood to make it a fourth, securing the crucial break in the first set with a blistering angled forehand.</p>

<p>She broke again early in the second as Rogers, playing in her first US Open quarter-final, sent a backhand wide, and wrapped up victory in an hour and 19 minutes.</p>

<p>Osaka said: 'For me honestly I felt she had the upper hand as I'd never beaten her, those memories stuck in my mind so it feels like a little bit of revenge.</p>

<p>'I'm really glad I was able to have a much more positive attitude tonight. I feel pretty good. All the matches are really tough, it's made me really grateful to be in this position.' </p>

<p>Osaka will now meet American 28th seed Jennifer Brady in the semi-finals </p>
