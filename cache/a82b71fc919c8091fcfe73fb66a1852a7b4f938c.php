<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin has confirmed that he has become a shareholder of League Two outfit Forest Green Rovers.</p>

<p>The Spanish right back has been very active off the pitch in recent years in terms of looking after the environment, and he has since joined Forest Green's board as he wants to help develop their eco-friendly work.</p>

<p>In 2015, Forest Green became the world's first vegan club serving plant-based food to both fans and players and under chairman Dale Vince, they have been labelled the 'greenest football club in the world' by FIFA. </p>

<p>Hector Bellerin has taken out a minority holding in League Two outfit Forest Green Rovers</p>

<p>And Bellerin, who has opted for a vegan diet recently and is extremely passionate in his sustainability work, hailed the League Two side as a 'clear example of how to run a football club.'</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Bellerin told The Athletic: 'I am announcing that I'm becoming a shareholder for Forest Green Rovers. This is something that has been in the works for quite a long time now. </p>

<p>'As many people know, Forest Green Rovers are a team that are known for their eco procedures and principles that Dale (Vince) has implied in the team since he was there like 10 years ago.</p>

<p>He's revolutionised that football club, and now they're team that they're vegan, they're eco-friendly, they have a neutral carbon footprint.</p>

<p>Forest Green have been recognised as the 'greenest football club in the world' by FIFA </p>

<p>'So they're a clear example of how to run a football club in our time. </p>

<p>'So I wanted to be part of it, I wanted to offer my help to them in whichever way I could and I'm very excited to bring the news.'</p>

<p>The 25-year-old's investment in Forest Green combines his love and passion for both football and environmentalism.</p>

<p>Just under three months ago, Bellerin partnered with global charity One Tree Planted - in which he pledged to plant 3,000 trees for every victory Arsenal claimed in the Premier League last season when the top-flight restarted.</p>
