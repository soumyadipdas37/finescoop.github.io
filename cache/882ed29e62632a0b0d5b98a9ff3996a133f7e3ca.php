<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jamie Carragher said Chelsea goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is enduring 'nightmare' after another costly error in his side's 2-0 defeat against Liverpool.</p>

<p>The Spaniard was at fault once again for the Blues after inadvertently passing the ball straight to the onrushing Sadio Mane to allow an easy finish for the Liverpool forward.</p>

<p>With Chelsea already losing 1-0 and down to 10 men at the time of a mistake, it was a moment which summed up a disappointing day for the west London side, who also saw a late Jorginho penalty saved by Alisson Becker. </p>

<p>Jamie Carragher said Kepa Arrizabalaga is enduring a 'nightmare' after another error</p>

<p>The Sky Sky Sports pundit admitted he feels sorry for the Spaniard after a string of mistakes</p>

<p>His error comes after several unconvincing showings last season which appears to have continued into this campaign after also being at fault for Leandro Trossard's goal for Brighton in Chelsea's season opener on Monday.</p>

<p>While the Sky Sports pundit was full of praise for Mane's desire to intercept the pass after giving the ball away, he admitted he is beginning to feel for the 25-year-old. </p>

<p>'The reason they're the top players in the world is their pressing. Chelsea were stranded in that midfield', said the former Liverpool stalwart after the game.</p>

<p>'As players you go through tough times and Kepa is going through one at the moment. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old passed the ball straight to onrushing Sadio Mane who was six yards out</p>

<p>The Liverpool forward made no mistake after the gift and duly put the reds 2-0 up</p>

<p>It is another of several mistakes made by the keeper whose confidence has deserted him</p>

<p>'You actually feel a bit sorry for him now. He's just having one of those nightmare moments.' </p>

<p>As Kepa shows no signs of arresting his worrying form, Chelsea have been actively searching for a replacement number one, with Rennes 'keeper Eduoard Mendy believed to be Frank Lampard's prime choice.</p>

<p>Fellow pundit Jamie Redknapp suggested it is no surprise Chelsea are looking elsewhere, adding: 'You can't have passengers in the modern game. That's why Chelsea want to get a new goalkeeper, that's why they've got a new centre-back and a new left-back.'  </p>

<p>Fellow pundit Jamie Redknapp (R) added that Chelsea cannot afford to have passengers </p>

<p>When asked about what need to be done to improve Kepa's form, Lampard responded: 'To try and give him confidence because a goalkeeper relies on confidence. These things do happen.' </p>

<p>'How do you gauge confidence? I don't know. It's just a clear mistake today.' </p>
