<p>On Tuesday, 90210 star Jason Priestley has given an update on his former co-star Shannen Doherty's health amid her battle with stage IV breast cancer [Pictured on Studio 10]</p>

<p>Shannen, who played Brenda Walsh on Beverly Hills, 90210, revealed she was diagnosed with stage IV breast cancer in February, three years after going into remission.</p>

<p>Speaking with ABC's Good Morning America at the time, she said: 'It's going to come out in a matter of days or a week that I'm stage four, so my cancer came back, and that's why I'm here.</p>

<p>'I don't think I've processed it. It's a bitter pill to swallow in a lot of ways.'</p>

<p>Back in March, the American actress slammed those who were not social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic while saying that her underlying health battle was 'hard enough'.  </p>

<p>'She's a fighter!' The 51-year-old told Studio 10's Angela Bishop that he ensured to keep in close contact with 49-year-old Shannen [pictured] and 'last he spoke with her she was in pretty good spirits'</p>

<p>Jason said: 'Shannen is a real tough girl. Shannen's a fighter, and she's always been a fighter, and I know she'll continue to fight as hard as she can'</p>

<p>However, Shannen has regularly credited her friends, exercise and healthy eating for pushing her through her debilitating cancer battle.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Jason, who is currently starring in the comedy-drama Private Eyes, spoke gushingly about her daughter Ava, who recently turned 13.</p>

<p>'Listen Ava's a really good kid. The one thing that has changed with her [since becoming a teenager] is that she's a little bit more distance. She tries to hide in her room and get away from us a bit more.   </p>

<p>'It's heart-breaking. She's my little girl! I'm used to her always wanting to hug me.'</p>

<p>When asked if he thought the mothers of Ava's friends had posters of him growing up, Jason explained it was actually her teachers who used to have a crush on him.</p>

<p>'That part has been sobering, to say the least,' Jason explained.</p>

<p>Jason played the role of teenage heartthrob Brandon Walsh from 1990-2000.</p>
