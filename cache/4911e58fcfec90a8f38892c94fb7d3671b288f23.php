<p>Retired anesthetist Freya Keogh has offloaded her $12million Jutland Parade home in Perth's western suburbs for a cool but cut-price $10.35million.</p>

<p>She complained that the newly-built super dwelling overlooked her swimming pool and blocked out the stunning river views - bringing down the price.</p>

<p>War of the wealthy: A doctor with a multi-million dollar mega mansion has been forced to sell at a 'cut price'</p>

<p>The owner complained after an even bigger home next door 'invaded her privacy' by overlooking her pool (pictured)</p>

<p>Retired anesthetist Freya Keogh offloaded her $12 million Jutland Parade home in Perth's Western suburbs for just $10.35 million</p>

<p>The ugly neighbourhood dispute was fought out over a number of years in a very bitter and public battle.</p>

<p>The local council initially sided with Dr Keogh's calls to stop the mammoth property being built, citing excessive construction noise and privacy concerns as the main reasons for the ruling.</p>

<p>But the State Administrative Tribunal disagreed and the council soon backflipped on its decision, although a few of Dr Keogh's demands were met.</p>

<p>She told the West Australian she had 'a few wins' which included a reduction in the height of a fence.</p>

<p>Dr Keogh was also allowed to engage a development planner to negotiate the ongoing construction works. </p>

<p>The development Ms Keogh hates so much is not technically just one mansion, it's actually three owned and lived in by the same family.</p>

<p>The Franco family made their fortune in the 70s and 80s with the industrial firm, the Fero Group. </p>

<p>Mario Franco and Maggie Franco (left) live in Australia's largest mega mansion, which angered neighbour Dr Freya Keogh (right)</p>

<p>Its lucrative business operates as a steel manufacturing and anti-corrosion service, that provides products and support to oil, gas and mining companies, as well as some civil, marine, commercial and industrial firms. </p>

<p>The five-storey 3500sqm middle home, is owned by Mario Franco and his wife Maggie.</p>

<p>It's now the largest home in Western Australia and has roughly the same amount of floor space as a supermarket complex - or about 15 average-sized homes.</p>

<p>The two four-storey mansions either side belong to sons Robert, the company's finance director, and Michael, the company's managing director.</p>

<p>The homes stand at a modest 2800sqm in comparison with enough garage space for about for 16 cars each.</p>

<p>Although the sale is not yet fully official, Ms Keogh said in her mind she has already moved on from the the long-running saga.</p>

<p>'Mentally, I've already waved them goodbye,' she said.  </p>
