<p>Built 10 years ago on Forresters Beach, between Terrigal and Bateau Bay, the four-bedroom, three-bathroom home is fitted with a games room, home gym, multiple living rooms, a frameless shower and a courtyard.</p>

<p>The architect Matt Thitchener built the property to withstand cyclones if necessary, due to the fact that his parents - who previously owned the house - are structural engineers. </p>

<p>It is split across three levels and houses decks on each level, alongside a beautiful spacious rooftop and spa. </p>
