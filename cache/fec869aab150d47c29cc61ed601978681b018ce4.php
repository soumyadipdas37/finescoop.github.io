<p>Legal assistant Danae Lomen, 24, suffered a fractured palate, multiple fractures to her jaw, a fractured right arm and four teeth were knocked out when the cyclist crashed into her on a shared pathway. </p>

<p>'I hit the concrete face first and it was a lot of blood. I'd lost consciousness, it was quite traumatic,' Ms Lomen told A Current Affair. </p>

<p>Melbourne legal assistant Danae Lomen, 24, (pictured) is facing huge medical bills after suffering horrific injuries when a cyclist struck her from behind on a shared pathway</p>

<p>The 24-year-old is now off work and said she faces dental bills of at least $25,000 as well as tens of thousands of dollars in medical bills.</p>

<p>She can't access compensation through Victoria's Traffic Accident Commission because collisions between cyclists and pedestrians are not covered. </p>

<p>The Transport Accident Act 1986 defines a 'transport accident' as 'an incident directly caused by the driving of a motor car or motor vehicle, a railway train or a tram'. </p>

<p>Ms Lomen's sister, Jessica Arias, was stunned to learn there was no compensation available for her sister. </p>

<p>'There is no system in place. There's no insurance fees, there's no registration for cyclists to prevent this from happening to someone in the future,' she said.</p>

<p>'Now she's going to either end up in massive amounts of debt or just have to live with no front teeth.'  </p>

<p>Ms Lomen (pictured before the accident) suffered a fractured jaw, a fractured arm, a fractured palate and had four teeth knocked out when she struck the footpath face first, her dental bills are excepted to be at least $25,000</p>
