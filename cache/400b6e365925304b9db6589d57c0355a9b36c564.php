<p>Legendary award winning music producer and composer Tony Renis gave a surprise serenade to the wife of LA Galaxy soccer star Rolf Feltscher</p>

<p>In a video exclusively obtained by DailyMail.com, she can be seen breaking down in tears as Renis sang her his famous ballad 'Quando Quando Quando'</p>

<p>The LA Galaxy player's wife, Giuliana Feltscher, was devastated by the loss of her 63-year-old father to the coronavirus, after he battled the disease in a coma in an Italian hospital for three months.</p>

<p>The father and daughter were very close, and one of her fondest memories was of him singing her the classic 1962 Italian standard Quando Quando Quando when she was a little girl.</p>

<p>Into his sixties, the old don still sang the pop song to Giuliana, 31, and taught it to her own daughter Kim at the age of three.</p>

<p>Giuliana Feltscher's father, who died from COVID-19 in May, sang that song to her as a child (pictured together) </p>

<p>So when Giuliana's husband, Swiss-Venezuelan LA Galaxy soccer team defender Rolf Feltscher, discovered he had a mutual friend with the Italian legendary singer, he plotted a surprise performance for his wife.</p>

<p>Feltscher, 29, brought her and their six-year-old daughter to a recording studio in Los Angeles, telling them he was helping record a cover of a Michael Jackson song.</p>

<p>But when the mother and daughter entered the studio, they were greeted by Giuliana's musical hero, calling in on a video link from Rome, Italy.</p>

<p>'Hello Giuly, I am Tony Renis from Roma, Italy,' the old pop star said.</p>

<p>'I heard from your husband Rolf all about you and your beautiful father Mimmo. I heard also that you lost him recently because of the terrible coronavirus. I'm so sorry for that Giuly, I'm really sorry.</p>

<p>'I heard that your father Mimmo was singing my song Quando Quando Quando since you were a little kid.'</p>

<p>The surprise, caught on camera by Feltscher's friend, overwhelmed the LA Galaxy player's wife, who gasped and started to cry.</p>

<p>'I heard also that he would sing it also to your little daughter Kim. I'm so proud to hear about that,' Renis said.</p>

<p>'Giuly, I have prepared something very, very special for you, that you can keep as a memory of your beautiful father Mimmo, for your future. I'm very proud to do that.</p>

<p>'Giuly I love you so much, and I want to tell you: Tell me when will you be mine?' the old crooner started to sing. 'Tell me Quando Quando Quando? Tell me when will you be mine? Tell me Quando Quando Giuly.'</p>

<p>The virtual performance was organized by an anonymous mutual friend of Renis and Feltscher, and was caught on camera at a music studio in Los Angeles</p>

<p>'We did this because we know you couldn't say goodbye to your father,' the friend said, choking back tears himself</p>

<p>The Italian music legend then smiled and nodded on the video screen as his song played in the studio, set to a photo montage of Mimmo with his daughter and granddaughter – who began singing along and cuddling her emotional mother.</p>

<p>Renis gained international success in 1962 with the ballad becoming an icon in Italy, and became a legendary award winning music producer and composer.</p>

<p>In 1999, the Italian star received a Golden Globe Award and was nominated for an Oscar for his collaboration with Canadian music mogul David Foster on the song 'The Prayer', performed by Céline Dion and Andrea Bocelli, from the Quest for Camelot movie soundtrack.</p>

<p>Renis wrote the Italian lyrics for the song and produced it with Foster, Carole Bayer Sager and Alberto Testa.</p>

<p>Renis also wrote and produced the Pavarotti and Céline Dion song 'I Hate You Then I Love You' with Foster.</p>

<p>Renis and Feltscher's anonymous friend, who arranged the 82-year-old singer's surprise serenade, interviewed the sobbing Giuliana after the performance.</p>

<p>Rolf Feltscher is #25 on the Los Angeles soccer team LA Galaxy. Seen her on July 18 </p>

<p>'We did this because we know you couldn't say goodbye to your father,' the friend said, choking back tears himself.</p>

<p>'We know you couldn't see him when he was sick with the coronavirus. We're hoping that this is a way to heal your heart and your soul.'</p>

<p>Back in March, Giuliana 's father came down with a cold. When the symptoms worsened after two weeks, he finally realized he had coronavirus.</p>

<p>The 63-year-old went into a coma in hospital for three months, and eventually died in May – before his LA-based daughter could visit him again.</p>

<p>'It's the best surprise I could have ever asked for,' Giuliana told the anonymous friend in the video. 'I'm feeling happy, sad, everything.</p>

<p>'The song means everything. My dad sang it for [Kim] every time. I have a video of him singing the song.</p>

<p>'It's a surprise for me because [Feltscher] told me nothing. I just heard he was singing a Michael Jackson song. It's amazing.'</p>
