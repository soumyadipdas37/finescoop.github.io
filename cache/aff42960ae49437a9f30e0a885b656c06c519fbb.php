<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Middlesbrough are prepared to sell goalkeeper Aynsley Pears with one year remaining on his contract, Sportsmail understands.</p>

<p>It had been expected that the club would secure the future of the highly-rated stopper, who is the son of former Boro favourite Stephen.</p>

<p>Pears, 22, has appeared 25 times for the Championship club and was first choice for the majority of last season under Jonathan Woodgate.</p>

<p>Middlesbrough keeper Aynsley Pears is set for a surprise exit from Neil Warnock's squad</p>

<p>Pears was used as first-choice keeper for much of Jonathan Woodgate's reign this season</p>

<p>However, Neil Warnock started with Dejan Stojanovic during Friday's 4-3 win over Shrewsbury in the EFL Cup and sources say the club are open to offers for Pears.</p>

<p>That will come as a surprise to many supporters and Pears - a former England youth international - is likely to attract much interest.</p>

<p>His contract expires next summer but, despite talks, it now appears that his days on Teesside are numbered.</p>

<p>Warnock played Dejan Stojanovic between the sticks in Boro's EFL clash with Shrewsbury </p>
