<p>Recently-appointed Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has informed Luis Suarez that he isn't in his plans, with Juventus looking to sign the Uruguayan.</p>

<p>As reported by goal, Martinez is at the top of Barcelona's wishlist as they look to bring in a new striker, despite links with Lyon's Memphis Depay. </p>

<p>Barcelona are preparing their final offer for Lautaro Martinez as they aim to sign a new striker</p>

<p>Martinez has demonstrated his credentials for Inter, having scored 30 goals in 84 appearances since joining from Racing Club in 2018.</p>

<p>Crucially, Martinez is ten years younger than Suarez, with Barcelona looking to rebuild their squad.</p>

<p>Suarez is in talks with Barcelona over the termination of his contract, which expires next year.</p>

<p>Martinez could end up replacing Luis Suarez, who is eager to secure a move to Juventus</p>

<p>New Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman is tasked with trying to reshape the club's squad </p>

<p>As reported by Marca, the striker has reportedly agreed a £9million-a-year salary with Juventus.</p>

<p>According to ESPN, Suarez is training away from the main group at Barcelona alongside Arturo Vidal until his future is sorted. </p>

<p>Barcelona have already brought in Miralem Pjanic, as well as having previously secured deals for Pedri and Francisco Trincao.</p>

<p>There is still much more work to do, however, as Koeman seeks to get Barcelona to bounce back following a hugely frustrating campaign.</p>

<p>Barcelona have also been linked with a move for Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum, who Koeman knows well from his time in charge of the Dutch national team. </p>
