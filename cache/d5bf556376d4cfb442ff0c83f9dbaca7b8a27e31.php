<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former Ferrari chief Ross Brawn has opened up on Michael Schumacher's bullish character that saw him dominate Formula One – claiming the intimidating German was often 'misunderstood'.</p>

<p>Brawn oversaw all seven of Schumacher's championships as technical director for both Benetton and Ferrari, which saw the 51-year-old cement his legacy as the sport's greatest ever driver.</p>

<p>Schumacher was known for his intensity and ruthless approach on the track, which saw him create a dislikeable persona among his peers during his heyday in F1.</p>

<p>Schumacher often divided opinion among racing fans during stages of his career when he was accused of driving dangerously to win world championships, leaving many to question his character.</p>

<p>While he had an air of intimidation as a result, Brawn insists the man away from the track was a lot more engaging and personal.</p>

<p>‘He was a pretty misunderstood character,' Brawn said in Sky's new docuseries Race to Perfection. 'I don’t know if in his own mind he quite enjoyed the sort of impression he created because he was quite an intimidating character in many ways. </p>

<p>'But if you knew him personally he was quite the opposite, very engaging, very personal. </p>

<p>Brawn, now managing director for Formula One, says Schumacher was often 'misunderstood'</p>

<p>'So many times I introduced him to people who, before they met him, thought he was a despicable, horrible character and you introduce them, and once they got to know him they completely changed. </p>

<p>'I had that happen so many times because there was Michael the racing driver out on the track and there was Michael the human being away from the track. </p>

<p>'I don’t know of anyone who worked with Michael who had a bad word to say about him. Lots of people who raced against him had a different opinion but nobody I know who ever worked with Michael ever had a bad opinion about him because of his integrity, his commitment, his human side. </p>

<p>'He was a very strong team member of any team he was part of and it’s a tragedy what’s happened but he’s a lovely human being.’</p>

<p>Brawn was talking about Schumacher on Sky's new original series Race to Perfection</p>

<p>Schumacher has been recovering from a near-fatal brain injury he suffered back in December 2013 when he fell and hit his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in the French Alps.</p>

<p>The 51-year-old was placed in a medically-induced coma which he is now out of, but following the skiing accident seven years ago, his condition has been kept a closely guarded secret from those outside his Lake Geneva mansion.</p>

<p>Schumacher won 72 of his record 91 victories for Ferrari before going on to finish his career at Mercedes.</p>

<p>The first two episodes of the Sky original series Race to Perfection are now available to all Sky and NOW TV customers on demand</p>
