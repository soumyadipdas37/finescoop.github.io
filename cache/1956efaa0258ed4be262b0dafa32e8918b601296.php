<p>But there wasn't any rest for Jimmy Kimmel as he arrived at his studio in Hollywood on Monday to resume taping his late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!</p>

<p>The 52-year-old comedian looked as if he planned to change into his standard suit later in the day, so he arrived in an ultra-casual outfit.</p>

<p>Back to work: Jimmy Kimmel, 52, was back to hosting Jimmy Kimmel Live! in Hollywood on Monday after hosting a socially distanced Emmys ceremony the night before</p>

<p>Kimmel represented his alma mater Arizona State University with a white T-shirt for the Sun Devils, and he paired it with some equally casual gray shorts.</p>

<p>He stayed comfortable in a set of gray, green and red athletic shoes that matched his gray socks. </p>

<p>The Man Show co-host also also a dark backpack strapped over one shoulder with some extra supplies for the evening.</p>

<p>Like the rest of his crew, he wore a pale blue surgical mask to help slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>

<p>No fuss: Kimmel represented his alma mater Arizona State University with a white T-shirt for the Sun Devils, and he paired it with some equally casual gray shorts</p>

<p>Jimmy has been receiving praise for his hosting job at the Emmys, which didn't feature an audience this year due to the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>During his monologue, he reused audience reactions from previous years to punch up his jokes, including a hilarious moment where he was pictured in the audience from an earlier broadcast.</p>

<p>But the host also irked some viewers with a joke he made about reporting British–American comedian John Oliver (who is now an American citizen) to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>

<p>Despite his best attempts, the audience-free broadcast had the lowest ratings of an Emmys ceremony. </p>

<p>That's in line with a trend of diminishing viewership in recent years, but some viewers may have also not been interested in a show without many in-person celebrities. </p>

<p>Sinking ship: Kimmel received praise for his hosting job, but the Emmys continued a trend of decreasing viewership for its lowest ratings ever</p>

<p>Yikes: He also irked some viewers with a joke about reporting British–American comedian John Oliver (who is now an American citizen) to Immigration and Customs Enforcement</p>

<p>One of the highlights of the ceremony was Schitt's Creek's sweep of the comedy awards, the first time a single show has won them all. </p>

<p>Viewers were also shocked as Zendaya, 24, pulled an upset by winning Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her lead role in HBO's Euphoria, becoming the youngest person to win that award.</p>

<p>HBO also won big in the drama categories, with the dramedy Succession taking home the Outstanding Drama Series award and Jeremy Strong beating out his costar Brian Cox for his role on the show.</p>

<p>Winners: One of the highlights of the ceremony was Schitt's Creek's sweep of the comedy awards, the first time a single show has won them all</p>

<p>Upset: Viewers were also shocked as Zendaya, 24, pulled an upset by winning Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her lead role in HBO's Euphoria, becoming the youngest person to win that award</p>

<p>Time to shine: HBO also won big in the drama categories, with the dramedy Succession taking home the Outstanding Drama Series award and Jeremy Strong beating out his costar Brian Cox</p>

<p>Now that he's finished with one hosting gig, Jimmy is back to doing his own TV show.</p>

<p>He has been away from his show for much of the summer after signing a new contract that allowed him to turn it over to celebrity guest hosts while he took a much-needed break.</p>

<p>'I’ll tell you just how to do it,' he explained to USA Today last week. 'The key is to be completely replaceable and try to get somebody to do your job for free for you. That’s it, that’s the secret right there,' he joked.</p>

<p>'You know what, I have been enjoying it, I really have taken to the idea of not working. I’m really good at it, too, it turns out.'</p>

<p>Time off: Kimmel has been away from his show for much of the summer after signing a new contract that allowed him to turn it over to celebrity guest hosts while he took a much-needed break</p>
