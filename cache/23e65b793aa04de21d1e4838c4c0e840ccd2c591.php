<p>Legging it: Malin Akerman was California casual when she was spotted taking her dog out for a walk in Los Angeles this Wednesday</p>

<p>The Stockholm native recently told Parade that when it comes to her psychological well-being 'I try to take a moment for myself every day.'</p>

<p>Malin revealed: 'I took a course on Transcendental Meditation a while back, and I really enjoy that when I have time. Getting out in nature has been great for me, and exercise is always good for my brain.'</p>

<p>The Watchmen star added: 'I can wake up feeling groggy and tired and not ready for the day, but as soon as I get some movement in, it shifts my whole perspective and capacity to deal with the day. When I need it, I definitely tap into a therapist. And sometimes, it’s just indulging in a glass of wine - that’s great for my mental health.' </p>

<p>She shares her son Sebastian, seven, with her ex-husband, Italian drummer Robert Zincone, whom she met when they were both in the band The Petalstones.</p>
