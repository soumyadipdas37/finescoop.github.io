<p>The Good Morning Britain presenter, 55, praised the company's 'world-class marketing' skills as it marked two years since the launch of the Stevenage Challenge - an advertising campaign which encouraged football fans to turn Stevenage FC into 'the biggest club in the online world'.</p>

<p>After the famous brand poked fun at his message, the host made sure to bring up their past ties as he responded: 'You lot once paid me a fortune to strip virtually naked for your customers. FYI.'</p>

<p>Past ties: Piers Morgan made a reference to his 2009 Burger King campaign after the fast food chain sarcastically said: 'Agreeing with Piers Morgan - it must be 2020' on Wednesday</p>

<p>The media personality's original tweet read: 'This is world-class marketing...Congrats <?php echo e('@'); ?>BurgerKing &amp; <?php echo e('@'); ?>StevenageFC - so smart', to which Burger King replied: 'Agreeing with Piers Morgan - it must be 2020'.</p>

<p>The journalist's shoot with the food giant saw him strip down to just a velvet cloth as he laid in front of a roaring fire to promote its meat-scented cologne called Flame. </p>

<p>Playing down suggestions of a publicity stunt, a Burger King spokesman said at the time: 'It's a very manly smell. It's a real change from the his-and-hers type scents. It's well known that certain foods can increase your libido.</p>

<p>'Flame has a hint of grilled beef but that has quite masculine connotations. It is almost like a pheromone.' </p>

<p>Awkward! The presenter, 55, praised the company's marketing skills as it marked two years since the creation of the Stevenage Challenge, but he was met with a frosty reception</p>

<p>'You lot once paid me a fortune!' After the famous brand poked fun at his message, the host made sure to bring up their past ties</p>

<p>Piers' social media activity came amid claims he invited Gemma Collins to give a 'deeply personal' interview on his Life Stories programme.</p>

<p>The former TOWIE star, 39, is said to have spent 'more than six hours' filming the show in an episode which will air later in the year. </p>

<p>She reportedly discussed her 'toxic' on-off relationship with James Argent on the series as well as her previous exes. </p>

<p>The reality star was also asked about her 'self-made millionaire status' after she was believed to have landed a six-figure contract with Wizz Air and £500K fashion deal with In The Style over the summer. </p>

<p>Collaboration? Piers' social media activity came amid claims he invited Gemma Collins to give a 'deeply personal' interview on his Life Stories programme </p>

<p>Gemma and James, 32, split for good in July after she posted break-up texts on her Instagram account in which he called her a 'hippo' and a 'fat f**k'. </p>

<p>The former couple had split in 2019 after Arg, who admitted he is a cocaine addict and overdosed twice last year, refused rehab yet they reconciled weeks later.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun On Sunday: 'It was an emotional rollercoaster and Gemma opened up to him about deeply personal subjects, including how toxic her relationship with Arg had become and some exes who were abusive to her. </p>

<p>'It was a cathartic experience, though, and she's proud of how far she's come.' MailOnline has contacted ITV, Gemma and Piers' representatives for comment at the time.</p>
