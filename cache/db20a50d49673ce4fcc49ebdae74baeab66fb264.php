<p>Acquired taste: Jackie 'O' Henderson revealed on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on Tuesday that she's only attracted to criminals  </p>

<p>'When I look at news stories and see pictures of people who the articles are about, I would say 98% of the time the hot guy always turns out to be the felon,' she said. </p>

<p>'I see the picture and say ''he's hot, what's he about?,'' Oh, he’s another criminal,' she laughed off.</p>

<p>'It's really worrying Kyle, I don't want to end up with someone like that,' she said.</p>

<p>In an attempt to expose Jackie's wild side, her co-host Kyle Sandilands arranged for a group of males to appear in the studio for her to pick out the best looking men.</p>

<p>Each line up contained two males who didn't have a criminal past, and one that did.</p>

<p>'It's really worrying Kyle, I don't want to end up with someone like that' she said </p>

<p>But luck wasn't on Jackie's side, each time choosing the man with a 'criminal' past.</p>

<p>Kyle, 49, didn't appear shocked by her results, instead telling Jackie: 'Just fall into it... You know what it’s like...'</p>

<p>'A lot of my friends wanna bang you too even the ones in jail,' he continued.</p>
