<p>Posting on Tripadvisor, Guillaume R left one star for the British chef's York &amp; Albany eatery in Camden earlier this week, alongside a scathing review.</p>

<p>Titled 'Gordon is not Heston', referring to fellow celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, the post suggested Gordon was treating his customers as a 'joke'.</p>

<p>Gordon Ramsay has been savaged online by a diner who recently visited one of his London restaurants and was left disappointed with the small steak and chips (pictured), costing £23</p>

<p>Posting on Tripadvisor, Guillaume R left one star for the British chef's York &amp; Albany eatery in Camden earlier this week, alongside a scathing review (above)</p>

<p>'When one masters and creates molecular cuisine the other has come up with homeopathic cuisine,' the diner wrote.</p>

<p>'Gordon isn't Heston but Gordon is Jesus. He multiples the steaks. Give him a regular sized one portion steak in any restaurant and this is what he comes up with.</p>

<p>'Five slices of meat over-salted fries. £23...,' the customer added, alongside a photograph of the meal. </p>

<p>'Gordon you made a name giving advice on how to run a restaurant. Let me give you my advice. This is COVID time. Hospitality sector is in bad shape. </p>

<p>'Blatantly joking at your customers won't help your business,' the diner continued, before offering two stars for the 'polite staff'.</p>

<p>Titled 'Gordon is not Heston', referring to fellow celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal, the post suggested the portions were a 'joke' and the fries were 'over salted'. Pictured, Gordon in 2019</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Gordon Ramsay's representative for comment. </p>

<p>The review comes after Gordon, 53, was mocked on Twitter last week for the Full English breakfast served at his Savoy Grill restaurant.</p>

<p>He posted a picture of the dish to his social media account to explain that it will be available at his London restaurant from September 21.</p>

<p>But social media users were left gobsmacked after discovering the meal - which includes two eggs, one sausage, a few strips of bacon, one tomato and one mushroom - cost £19. </p>

<p>Many people questioned 'where's the rest of it?’ - with one person even sharing a snap of a large traditional Full English made up of six slices of bacon, three sausages, two fried eggs and a large hash brown. But the photograph appeared to be too much for Gordon, who unleashed his well-known 'idiot sandwich' phrase on the Twitter user (above)</p>

<p>Many people criticised the steep price, while others questioned 'where's the rest of it?’ - with one person even sharing a snap of a large traditional Full English made up of six slices of bacon, three sausages, two fried eggs and a large hash brown.</p>

<p>But the photograph appeared to be too much for Gordon, who unleashed his well-known 'idiot sandwich' phrase on the Twitter user. </p>

<p>The chef replied to the snap: 'That’s called a Full English Classic Heart Attack you idiot sandwich,' using the saying which he coined in a parody of his show Hell's Kitchen in 2015.</p>
