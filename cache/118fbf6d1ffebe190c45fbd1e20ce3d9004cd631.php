<p>And now former AFL star Brendan Fevola has revealed what really happened after the wild night out. </p>

<p>Speaking on his FOX FM radio show on Tuesday, the 39-year-old revealed his then pregnant wife Alex was left furious at him and said he was shocked at the media attention his antics received. </p>

<p>'It was tough': Former AFL star Brendan Fevola revealed this week on his radio show what REALLY happened after he infamously got drunk at the Brownlow Medal Count in 2009 and said wife Alex (pictured) was furious</p>

<p>'This time 11 years ago I was waking up at the beautiful Crown casino,' Brendan said. </p>

<p>'Just got the arms up, turned over to my pregnant wife and said, "oh god, last night was good."</p>

<p>'And she said, "you're a beepwit." And I didn't know what happened. It was the Brownlow night that I'd got hammered,' he said. </p>

<p>Out of control? Brendan, working for Channel Nine's AFL Footy Show, pretended to attack Carlton superstar Chris Judd, made sexual jokes to his partner Bec, kissed Sydney Swans midfielder Ryan O'Keefe (pictured) and snapped at the condescension of James Hird</p>

<p>He then said with a cheeky laugh: 'So today 11 years ago was a real tough day, probably one of the toughest I’ve gone through I reckon.'</p>

<p>Brendan said he then was inundated with phone calls from the CEO of the Carlton Football Club, Greg Swann, while out at lunch and was told to go straight home.   </p>

<p>He said he had no idea what was going on until he got home and saw media outside of his house, which he didn't leave for a week.  </p>

<p>'The Mrs was rapt,' Brendan said. </p>

<p>'The Mrs was rapt': Brendan said he then was inundated with phone calls from the CEO of the Carlton Football Club, Greg Swann, while out at lunch and was told to go straight home</p>

<p>'I walked inside because Alex had already left because I had the lunch. She'd gone home and she's sitting on the couch and had the TV on pause... She said have a look at this,' showing his antics from the night. </p>

<p>He added: 'I turned around and said maybe we should watch a couple of Foxtel movies.'</p>

<p>In September last year, Brendan revealed that his antics had ruined the festivities for attendees over the years.</p>

<p>'For the last nine years they have not been able to serve alcohol at a rapid rate that they use to,' Brendan said on his FOX 101.9FM Fifi, Fev and Byron show. </p>

<p>Brendan said every year he gets messages from fellow footballers who are unhappy by the new arrangement.</p>

<p>'They say "You p***k!" They hate me,' he explained.</p>

<p>Fellow retired AFL star Dane Swan even blamed Brendan's rowdy Brownlow night for ruining the event's celebrations on an industry podcast.  </p>

<p>Brendan infamously interviewed players and WAGs while heavily intoxicated at the 2009 Brownlow Medal count.</p>

<p>The former Carlton and Brisbane star, who was working for Channel Nine's AFL Footy Show at the time, pretended to attack then-Carlton superstar Chris Judd, made sexual jokes to his partner Bec, kissed Sydney Swans midfielder Ryan O'Keefe and snapped at the condescension of James Hird.</p>

<p>He left Carlton shortly after the fallout, and was temporarily banned from appearing on the Grand Final Footy Show. </p>

<p>Brendan discussed the scandal on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2016 and remained defiant that he didn't regret his behaviour.</p>

<p>'No I had a great time,' he said. 'I didn't hurt anyone. I was really p**sed, if you didn't notice.'</p>

<p>But later, he seemed willing to accept blame for his actions and told his fellow campers: 'It was my own fault.'</p>

<p>In 2011, Brendan went to rehab for gambling as well as drinking and depression for 60 days and was sacked from playing AFL while there.</p>

<p>Aftermath: He left Carlton shortly after the fallout, and was temporarily banned from appearing on the Grand Final Footy Show. Pictured on the field in 2010</p>
