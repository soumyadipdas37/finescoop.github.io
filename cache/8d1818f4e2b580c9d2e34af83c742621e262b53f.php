<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Craig Revel Horwood has risked the ire of BBC bosses after saying he thinks Strictly Come Dancing contestant Nicola Adams will be 'punching above her weight' while Bill Bailey will be a 'terrible' dancer.</p>

<p>The brutally honest judge, 55, didn't hold back when he was asked his thoughts on some of this year's contestants who are yet to take to the dancefloor.</p>

<p>Speaking on Mecca Bingo online, Craig said: 'I think Nicola Adams will be punching above her weight, darling.'</p>

<p>Outspoken: Craig Revel Horwood has admitted he thinks Strictly Come Dancing contestant Nicola Adams will be 'punching above her weight' while Bill Bailey will be a 'terrible' dancer</p>

<p>The phrase is often used for someone who has a more attractive partner, however Craig added: 'But I am looking forward to seeing a same-sex couple. That’s going to be cool.'</p>

<p>The TV star was also asked what he thought of Bill Bailey's chances on the series and said: 'Terrible. I’m looking forward to the disasters!'</p>

<p>Craig does have more faith in The Wanted's Max George, who is a trained dancer, saying: 'Oh yeah, he's going to be great.'</p>

<p>An insider told The Sun that Craig's jibe at Nicola was not 'misogynistic', but referred to the fact she has said she is not the best dancer.</p>

<p>Not confident: Craig was also asked what he thought of Bill Bailey's chances on the series and said: 'Terrible. I’m looking forward to the disasters!' (pictured in May 2019)</p>

<p>They said: 'Craig always shoots from the hip, and won’t be kowtowed into diplomatic silence.</p>

<p>'On his cutting remarks on Nicola though, Craig wasn’t being misogynistic — he was simply referring to her dancing as she has openly said she’s not a natural mover.</p>

<p>'Obviously at this stage of the competition, he shouldn’t be saying who he thinks the best and worst dancers will be. He is supposed to be neutral — so this isn’t great.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted a representative for Strictly Come Dancing for comment.  </p>

<p>High hopes: Craig does have more faith in The Wanted's Max George, who is a trained dancer, saying: 'Oh yeah, he's going to be great'</p>

<p>When asked if he has any favourites yet, Craig said: 'I would have a favourite if I'd seen them dance. I just need to see them walk down a set of stairs to music, then I can judge them. Some people can’t even do that.</p>

<p>'And that’s before they go on to the dance floor — and then it becomes a complete and utter disaster.'</p>

<p>It's not the first time Craig has risked angering his bosses as he previously landed in hot water for comments he made about former winner Stacey Dooley.  </p>

<p>Craig was reportedly forced to issue an apology by show bosses, after a dig at Stacey left her mum in tears.</p>

<p>Remark: An insider told The Sun that Craig's jibe at Nicola was not 'misogynistic', but referred to the fact she has said she is not the best dancer</p>

<p>According to reports, the famously cutthroat star hinted that celebrity contestants should sleep with their professional partners during filming for last year's launch, after Stacey embarked on a romance with pro Kevin Clifton.</p>

<p>Sources stated that the snide remarks stunned the audience and crew members, with filming quickly halted so the comment could be scrapped.</p>

<p>It was then reported that producers rushed to check on a furious Kevin, Stacey and her mum Di, who left the studio in floods of tears.</p>

<p>Bosses quickly told Craig that the comment was unacceptable, and he was reportedly happy to take Stacey to one side where he apologised.</p>

<p>Dance: Asked if he has a favourite, Craig said: 'I just need to see them walk down a set of stairs to music, then I can judge them. Some people can’t even do that'</p>
