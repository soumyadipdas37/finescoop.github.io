<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lucas Vazquez is pondering cutting off his long association with Real Madrid, as the Spanish champions have received an offer for the academy product.</p>

<p>The winger was a bit-part player in Madrid's LaLiga triumph last season, starting just eight matches in the league and contributing two goals and two assists. </p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane is willing to let the 29-year-old go this summer, with Marca reporting that an unnamed Qatari club have submitted an 'important financial offer' for the Spaniard.</p>

<p>Winger Lucas Vasquez could be on his way out of boyhood club Real Madrid this summer </p>

<p>The Spaniard has spent all but one of his professional seasons at Madrid, but a bid has come in</p>

<p>Zinedine Zidane is willing to let Vasquez leave for the unnamed Qatari club this summer</p>

<p>Vasquez is said to be weighing-up his options, wanting to take his time over the decision before deciding to leave the club he joined at under-17 level.    </p>

<p>The winger only has one year left on his Madrid deal and the Spanish giants could push Vasquez out to avoid the star leaving for free. </p>

<p>Tottenham and Napoli were both linked with Vasquez this summer but there has reportedly been no movement from either club towards a deal. </p>

<p>Vasquez struggled for game time last season with Madrid stacked for options on the wings</p>

<p>Qatar have already robbed LaLiga of Santi Cazorla this summer, with the former Villarreal star linking-up with his ex-Spain team-mate Xavi at Al Sadd.  </p>

<p>Xavi moved into management in Qatar after joining Al Sadd for the dying days of his playing career, after a glorious stint as Barcelona captain. </p>
