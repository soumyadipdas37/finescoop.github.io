<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tyson Fury has urged Anthony Joshua to 'grow a pair' and step in to fight him this December if his planned trilogy clash with Deontay Wilder doesn't go ahead.</p>

<p>The self-styled Gypsy King has been training throughout lockdown in preparation to face Wilder for a third time, but the fight has been repeatedly pushed back.</p>

<p>The December 19 Las Vegas showdown has been called off again with Bob Arum confirming they are searching for new dates, and Fury - who has already agreed the financial side on a two-fight deal with Joshua for next year - has ordered his British rival to meet him for the undisputed heavyweight crown. </p>

<p>Tyson Fury want Anthony Joshua to step in if he can't fight Deontay Wilder in December</p>

<p>Speaking to talkSport, WBC champion Fury said: 'I will be fighting in December either against Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas or Joe Bloggs.</p>

<p>'I have made it very clear that if we cannot fight in America then I want a homecoming in the UK and I don't care about a crowd.</p>

<p>'I am about one-hour from going AWOL unless I get some good news.</p>

<p>'Tell AJ to grow a pair and step up to fight in December. If Wilder doesn't happen then let's get the AJ fight in December.</p>

<p>Joshua has a defence of his unified world titles against Kubrat Pulev pencilled in for this year</p>

<p>'If Wilder doesn't happen in December then I will step in and smash Anthony Joshua into next week.'</p>

<p>AJ has a mandatory defence of his IBF and WBA and WBO world titles against Kubrat Pulev pencilled in for December time but Fury is keen on bringing forward their Battle of Britain.</p>

<p>He added: 'I saw him get knocked out by Andy Ruiz Jr and then go back to his corner and jack it in.</p>

<p>'I don't think the rematch performance was a masterclass, that rematch was like watching paint dry.</p>

<p>'I have been in loads of dog fights and won them all, he has been in one and got beat.</p>

<p>Fury's proposed third fight has been repeatedly pushed back and does not have a new date yet</p>

<p>'Joshua is not man enough for me. Have you ever seen a knife go through butter before?</p>

<p>'I knock AJ out in three rounds. How would he get out the way of me? Is he fleet footed enough to get away from me?</p>

<p>'I would cut him down in two, it is not about tactics, it is about balls, guts and determination and I have those in abundance.</p>

<p>'Once this fight gets made I will show you what to do with a bodybuilder like that, you cut him in two.</p>

<p>'He jacked against Ruiz and he will do it again, once you have quit once you will quit again.'</p>
