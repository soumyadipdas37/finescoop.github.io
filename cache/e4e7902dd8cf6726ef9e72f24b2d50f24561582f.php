<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A champion young boxer, who was killed in a motorway crash, was speeding at the time and had taken cannabis, an inquest heard.</p>

<p>Mohammed Hashim, 18, died after his BMW collided with an the embankment and a barrier between junctions 14 and 15 of the M4 before flipping and rolling across the road on April 7.</p>

<p>The young boxer, from Cardiff, Wales, had been ranked second in the world for his age in boxing, had won national titles and had been compared to Muhammad Ali.</p>

<p>A hearing into his death yesterday (September 9) ruled there was a 'combination' of reasons that caused the crash.</p>

<p>Champion boxer Mohammed Hashim,18, died after his BMW crashed on the M4, in the early hours of April 7</p>

<p>Coroner Ian Singleton said: 'Mohammed sustained the injuries which led to his death at the time the vehicle landed on its roof.</p>

<p>'On a balance of probabilities, the vehicle left the road due to a 'combination' of excessive speed, the taking of cannabis and the lack of driving training and the passing of a driving test.'</p>

<p>Mr Singleton recorded the cause of death as a road traffic collision at Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner's Court in Salisbury, Wilts.</p>

<p>Mohammed's family previously paid tribute to him in a statement released by police, describing him as 'generous and thoughtful'.  </p>

<p>They said: 'Mohammed was an inspirational individual with good morals and ethics; he was a giver, a doer and never liked receiving.</p>

<p>'He was the most generous and thoughtful person anyone could meet. </p>

<p> 'Mohammed's views in life was: be kind to everyone, even the unkind ones because paying bad with bad does not equal to good.</p>

<p>'Mohammed had the most electrifying smile in the world, he could light up any room he entered.</p>

<p>'At 16, he had already accomplished a lot in his life - he became a national champion in his field of boxing and made both his family and nation proud.</p>

<p>'At one point in his career Mohammed was ranked second in the world for his age and was known for fighting in a similar style to the legend and his namesake Ali.</p>

<p>'Mohammed was an outstanding young individual with great prospects and was always full of energy.</p>

<p>'It's sad to see his life cut so short; he will be sadly missed and rest assured forever in our hearts.'</p>

<p>Carl Stephens, head coach at Llanedeyrn ABC boxing gym, also praised Mohammed in a statement previously released by Wiltshire Police.</p>

<p> Mohammed's family paid tribute to him and described him as 'generous and thoughtful'</p>

<p>He said: 'Mo was our number one boxer who represented us 36 times and winning 31 of those matches.</p>

<p>'He represented Wales and also won the Welsh Schoolboy and Welsh National Association of Boys and Girls' Clubs, as well as the British Championship.</p>

<p>'He had recently been training with accomplished professionals such as Andrew Selby and Jay Harris, who had recently boxed for world titles.</p>

<p>'Mo was just a young man compared to these seasoned boxers but they could not believe the ability he had with his limited experience.</p>

<p>'There were a lot of well placed people on the boxing circuit who thought Little Mo could have gone right to the top.</p>

<p>'Mo was like second son to me; he was a likeable, bubbly, smiling young man who everyone loved.</p>

<p>'It is a tragedy for his family, friends and all the boxing world that such a talent has been lost at such a young age.</p>

<p>'The boys at the gym will carry on in your memory and do their best to box in your shadow.</p>

<p>'Little Mo - simply the best.'</p>
