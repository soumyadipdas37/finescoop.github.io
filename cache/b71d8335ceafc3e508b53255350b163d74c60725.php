<p>Roberto Martinez's side will next be in action against England at Wembley on October 11 with only the top team in each pool advancing to the Nations League finals.</p>

<p>Belgium's Kevin De Bruyne, named Player of the Year by the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) in England shortly before kick-off, returned to the team after missing Saturday's 2-0 win in Denmark following the birth of his third child.</p>

<p>It was a lively start to the game with three goals inside the opening 16 minutes as Iceland grabbed the lead through Fridjonsson.</p>

<p>The tall striker had already missed a golden chance with a free header from close range when his deflected shot from the edge of the area looped over debutant Belgium goalkeeper Koen Casteels and into the net.</p>

<p>Axel Witsel scored with a header after Mertens' free-kick had rebounded off the crossbar</p>

<p>Batshuayi also netted from a rebound when Witsel's shot was pushed into his path by Iceland goalkeeper Ogmundur Kristinsson.</p>

<p>Mertens scored his second goal in as many games early in the second half after being teed up by the influential De Bruyne and Batshuayi netted his second with a lovely backheel finish.</p>

<p>Doku, 18, scored his first international goal on his maiden start for the side with an excellent curling shot 10 minutes from the end to complete a solid run-out for the home side.Â </p>
