<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The elected mayor of Middlesbrough today vowed to 'defy' new lockdown measures imposed on the town, accusing ministers of 'ignorance' after they brought in strict new measures for its population.</p>

<p>Independent Andy Preston lashed out after Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs the town, along with Liverpool, Hartlepool and Warrington would face the same curbs as the North East.</p>

<p>In a video message Mr Preston said they went futher than he and other local politicians had lobbied for, and in what is believed to be a first for a local politician, rejected the measures outlined in the Commons. </p>

<p>Middlesbrough and Hartlepool councils had asked for a ban on households mixing in their own homes. But Mr Hancock announced it would also be illegal for households in those boroughs to mix in a public setting such as a pub.</p>

<p>'I have to tell you I think this measure has been introduced based on factual inaccuracies and a monstrous and frightening lack of communication, and ignorance,' Mr Preston said in a video posted on Twitter.</p>

<p>'I do not accept the statement at all. I do not accept these measures. We need to talk to government, they need to understand our local knowledge, expertise and ability to get things done, and preserve jobs and well-being.</p>

<p>'We are really disappointed. As things stand we defy the Government and we do not accept these measures.</p>

<p>'We need to get Covid under control and we need to work with people to find a way of preserving jobs and mental health.'</p>

<p>The confirmation comes despite Mr Hancock hailing 'early' indications that the nationwide Rule of Six and 10pm pubs curfew are already bringing cases under control - and downgrading the swingeing measures in place in Bolton.</p>

<p>Results from the largest Covid-19 study in England found the R-rate fell from 1.7 to around 1.1 last month.</p>

<p>But the director of the study, by Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori, said the interim findings from 80,000 participants 'reinforced the need for protective measures' to help extinguish the virus.</p>

<p>Mr Hancock told the Commons: 'The study published today shows us hope that we can crack this.'</p>

<p>However, he again defied calls for the 10pm curfew on pubs to be lifted amid claims it is doing 'more harm than good'. Mr Hancock's positive message on the findings of the study contrasted sharply with the grim message from Boris Johnson, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance at a Downing Street press conference last night. </p>

<p>The PM and his senior medical and science advisers warned that the outbreak was 'going in the wrong direction' - even though it is understood they were aware of the latest Imperial findings in advance.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, there are signs that ministers are scrambling to simplify the rules after even the premier became muddled this week. A 'traffic light' system could be introduced to show what restrictions are in place for different regions, with three tiers of intensity. </p>

<p>There are hopes could help free up some parts of the South that have dramatically lower rates of infection than the North. </p>

<p>Liverpool had been braced for more measures to curb a recent rise in infections that has left it with the highest rolling seven-day rate of new cases at 258 per 100,000, while nearby Knowsley is second at 262. </p>

<p>In other developments today: </p>

<p>The weekly infection rate in Liverpool now stands at 258.4 per 100,000 people</p>

<p>The north west of England, which has seen areas such as Burnley and Liverpool (pictured today) placed under local restrictions, had the highest levels of infection while the number of infections</p>

<p>The REACT study, run by Imperial College London and funded by the Department of Health, has been tracking England's Covid-19 outbreak throughout the summer.</p>

<p>The prevalence of the virus is based on what proportion of people tested have a positive result, and is used to work out what percentage of people in the country currently have the virus. </p>

<p>This is how the data shows the change in England's outbreak: </p>

<p>Round three: July 24 - August 11 </p>

<p>Round four: August 20 - September 8 </p>

<p>Round five: September 18 - 25 </p>

<p>The most recent round of results from REACT provides estimates for the prevalence of the virus in different regions across England as follows:</p>

<p>Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hancock was repeatedly challenged over the blanket 10pm curfew on pubs and restaurants in England. </p>

<p>There were complaints that people have been causing issues by piling out of venues and going to the supermarket for more alcohol, or having house parties instead. </p>

<p>But Mr Hancock said: 'Of course, we keep this under review and of course we're constantly looking at how we can improve these policies, but I think we've got to look at both sides of the evidence to try to get this right.'</p>

<p>He added: 'We know that sustained contact, especially in crowded, poorly ventilated spaces is a driver of infection and pubs and bars an obvious risk.</p>

<p>'So I heard what he said about the 10pm rule, but my concerns relate to everybody leaving the pub at the same time.'</p>

<p>Earlier, Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson called for a two-week 'circuit-breaker' lockdown to restrict the virus from spreading. </p>

<p>But his colleague, Metro Mayor Steve Rotherham, repeated his opposition to the proposal, which he insisted was never discussed as an option when he spoke to Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty.  </p>

<p>The elected mayor of Middlesbrough said he was prepared to defy the Government and reject new coronavirus measures imposed on the town in what was thought to be a first for an authority figure.</p>

<p>Independent Andy Preston was furious with the new rules which go further than he and his counterparts in Hartlepool had lobbied for earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Middlesbrough and Hartlepool councils had asked for a ban on households mixing in their own homes.</p>

<p>But Health Secretary Matt Hancock went further and announced it would be illegal for households in those boroughs to mix in a public setting such as a pub – as was the case elsewhere in the North East.</p>

<p>In a video statement, Mr Preston said: 'I have to tell you I think this measure has been introduced based on factual inaccuracies and a monstrous and frightening lack of communication, and ignorance.</p>

<p>'I do not accept the statement at all.</p>

<p>'I do not accept these measures.</p>

<p>'We need to talk to government, they need to understand our local knowledge, expertise and ability to get things done, and preserve jobs and well-being.</p>

<p>'We are really disappointed.</p>

<p>'As things stand we defy the Government and we do not accept these measures.</p>

<p>'We need to get Covid under control and we need to work with people to find a way of preserving jobs and mental health.'</p>

<p>Simon Clarke, Conservative MP for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland, had been opposed to extra measures and spoke in the Commons earlier about the need for a clear exit strategy.</p>

<p>In response to the new rules, he said: 'I would like to personally thank Mr Hancock for ensuring that a clear, evidence-led exit strategy has been included in the measures imposed on Middlesbrough.</p>

<p>'I was clear in my opposition to any further local restrictions at this time, especially seen as the latest national restrictions had not had even a week to bed in.</p>

<p>The elected mayor of Middlesbrough said he was prepared to defy the Government and reject new coronavirus measures imposed on the town in what was thought to be a first for an authority figure.</p>

<p>Independent Andy Preston was furious with the new rules which go further than he and his counterparts in Hartlepool had lobbied for earlier in the week.</p>

<p>Middlesbrough and Hartlepool councils had asked for a ban on households mixing in their own homes.</p>

<p>But Health Secretary Matt Hancock went further and announced it would be illegal for households in those boroughs to mix in a public setting such as a pub – as was the case elsewhere in the North East.</p>

<p>'We need to talk to government, they need to understand our local knowledge, expertise and ability to get things done, and preserve jobs and well-being.</p>

<p>'We are really disappointed.</p>

<p>'As things stand we defy the Government and we do not accept these measures.</p>

<p>'We need to get Covid under control and we need to work with people to find a way of preserving jobs and mental health.' </p>

<p>'And while I respectfully disagreed with the decision of Middlesbrough mayor Andy Preston to request a local lockdown in Middlesbrough, I am in no doubt that he acted in good faith in making this request of the Government.</p>

<p>'So now we are where we are, our focus must shift to protecting the most vulnerable members of our society.'</p>

<p>Andy McDonald, Labour MP for Middlesbrough, said the new measures were 'inevitable'.</p>

<p>He said: 'I've said before that no one welcomes further restrictions, but we on Teesside sit next to seven neighbouring North East local authorities where tighter restrictions have been imposed for some time now because of worryingly high rates of Covid-19.</p>

<p>'It's only 13 miles from Middlesbrough to Sedgefield in County Durham and the virus is clearly in circulation right across the North East region at levels that are concerning and the virus pays no heed to the local authority borders between County Durham and the Tees Valley local authority areas.'</p>

<p>At the press conference last night, the PM dismissed pressure from many Tories to change strategy and focus on protecting jobs, saying he would not 'throw in the sponge'. </p>

<p>There has been increasing anxiety - including in Cabinet - about following the ultra-cautious approach from Prof Whitty and Sir Patrick. One senior minister told MailOnline that the government was now 'talking more widely to people with different views'.  </p>

<p>While the rate of infection appears to be falling, the study, commissioned by the Department of Health, found that of the volunteers tested between September 18-26, one in 200 people had coronavirus.</p>

<p>It also revealed the virus to be spreading more among young people, while simultaneously laying bare the North-South divide, pointing to the North West as the epicentre of the UK's outbreak.</p>

<p>Professor Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial from the School of Public Health, said: 'While our latest findings show some early evidence that the growth of new cases may have slowed, suggesting efforts to control the infection are working, the prevalence of infection is the highest that we have recorded to date.</p>

<p>'This reinforces the need for protective measures to limit the spread of the disease and the public's adherence to these, which will be vital to minimise further significant illness and loss of life from Covid-19.'  </p>

<p>Asked whether the Prime Minister and his advisers would have seen this study before their downbeat TV briefing yesterday, Professor Elliot said 'yes'.</p>

<p>'We report in weekly to Government and so they are aware of these statistics from our study,' he said this morning. 'Clearly there are a range of stats that are considered by Government and we're just one area.'</p>

<p>But he did not agree that the tone of the briefing should have been more optimistic, and said: 'I thought the messaging was very good yesterday. We've got to really quite high levels of the virus.</p>

<p>'One in 200 people who are walking the streets today, on average, [would] test positive for the virus. It's not dependent on the testing system [and] it's not just symptomatic people.</p>

<p>'I think people have begun to hear the message since the beginning of September. The rate of increase of the virus at the beginning for September was alarming… now we've got to high rates we've really got to do something about it and that was the message yesterday. The rate of rise may have slowed and that's the first step.'</p>

<p>Professor Steven Riley agreed and added: 'This [study] is entirely consistent with the messaging yesterday – 100 per cent consistent with the messaging. All the public health measures that are in place right now are absolutely crucial…</p>

<p>Coronavirus cases are at a much lower level than in March and local lockdowns might have helped control the outbreak, Jeremy Hunt said today. </p>

<p>The Health Select Committee chair insisted people should not be too alarmed by the situation, as earlier action had been taken this time around.</p>

<p>He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think the evidence from what happened earlier in the year, not just in this country but all over the world, is that acting early, decisively, quickly, is actually the best way to contain the spread of the virus and that's what I think Chris Whitty and the Prime Minister are saying.</p>

<p>'One of the things that is often not noted about Italy was the successful way in which they managed to contain the outbreak of the virus in northern Italy, in Lombardy, and avoid it spreading to the rest of the country.</p>

<p>'Now, we didn't manage to do that first time round but it just may be that these local lockdowns, although we haven't seen a big reduction in transmission within those areas, they may just have contained it and stopped it from becoming the national outbreak that we had before.'</p>

<p>'If we were reporting it we would very much comment on the prevalence. It [the messaging] has to go negative for us to avoid substantial numbers of hospitalisations and deaths.' </p>

<p>Politicians in the region met with Mr Hancock last night, with the final decision taken after a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson this morning.</p>

<p>Mr Anderson said measures to restrict travel, in place in some areas of Wales, had not been put forward, but he believed the Government was considering measures to ensure restaurants only take bookings.</p>

<p>Environment Secretary George Eustice told BBC Breakfast: 'I know that there are some discussions, I understand, that are going on about the situation in Liverpool, but no decisions have been taken yet.</p>

<p>'It's not really possible for me to say what they may or may not do since I think there's currently dialogue between health officials and the local council there.'</p>

<p>Halton MP Derek Twigg said he and other local MPs had 'demanded' a meeting with the Health Minister.</p>

<p>In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Mr Twigg said: 'I raised several concerns and issues and asked for evidence and data on the impact of Covid-19 on our area.</p>

<p>'I was assured that a decision has not yet been taken on the further local restrictions we may face but it is likely to be decided tomorrow.'</p>

<p>Local leaders have called for the Government to provide financial support if it brings in stricter restrictions.</p>

<p>In a joint statement, Liverpool City Region metro mayor Steve Rotheram and the leaders of Liverpool, Sefton, Wirral, St Helens, Halton and Knowsley authorities have called for the Government to work with them, provide financial support and increase testing capacity.</p>

<p>They said: 'Throughout the pandemic, we have always put the health of our residents first and we will continue to do everything we can to stop the spread of coronavirus and keep as many people as possible safe.</p>

<p>The REACT study shows that prevalence of the coronavirus has surged in all regions over the summer, with the North of England worst affected. Pictured: The graphs show different phases of the study, starting with May in the top left and September in the bottom right. Darker colours show higher rates of Covid-19</p>

<p>The prevalence of Covid-19 varies widely across different regions of England but is not lower than one case per 400 people in any part of the nation, the researchers said. It is highest in the North West, where almost one in 100 people are carrying the disease</p>

<p>The Imperial College London's predictions of the prevalence of Covid-19 - the percentage of people who have the illness - rose sharply in September (illustrated by the pink lines)</p>

<p>'However, at the same time, we must be clear that any further restrictions will deal a hammer blow to our economy.'</p>

<p>Where are the lockdowns being imposed?</p>

<p>The Welsh Government has announced Denbighshire, Flintshire, Conwy and Wrexham will be placed under local lockdowns from 6pm on Thursday.</p>

<p>Announcing the new measures, health minister Vaughan Gething said: 'It's always difficult to make the decision to impose restrictions but we hope that these measures will make a positive difference - just as we have seen in Caerphilly and Newport, where local residents have pulled together and followed the rules.'</p>

<p>What are the new restrictions?</p>

<p>Under the new measures, people under lockdown will not be allowed to enter or leave the county in which they live without a reasonable excuse, such as travel for work or education.</p>

<p>People will also only be able to meet people they do not live with outdoors and will not be able to form, or be in, extended households.</p>

<p>How many people will be affected?</p>

<p>The local lockdown will affect around 504,000 people and will bring the number of people in Wales under lockdown to more than 2.3 million.</p>

<p>It means 16 areas of the country will face some form of extra restrictions, with the majority of the other areas under lockdown located in South Wales.</p>

<p>Why are the measures being brought in?</p>

<p>The Welsh Government said the local lockdowns are being imposed after people meeting indoors, not following social-distancing guidelines and returning from summer holidays overseas with the virus led to a surge in cases.</p>

<p>Mr Gething said: 'These are largely linked to people socialising indoors and are the pattern of transmission similar to what we have seen in South Wales.</p>

<p>'We have worked closely with local authority leaders and the police in North Wales and we all agree about the need to take swift action to control the spread of the virus.'</p>

<p>How long will the lockdowns last?</p>

<p>While there is no definitive answer as to how long the new restrictions will be in place, authorities have said they will be under 'constant review'.</p>

<p>Councillor Mark Pritchard, leader of Wrexham County Borough Council, said: 'It's a balance between people's health and the economy, and we have to do everything we can to get it right.</p>

<p>'These measures will be kept under constant review as we look to control the spread of the virus in the counties of Conwy, Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham.' </p>

<p>Four Welsh local authority areas - Denbighshire, Flintshire, Conwy and Wrexham - will go into lockdown at 6pm tonight, with people banned from meeting anyone outside their household indoors. </p>

<p>People will also be forbidden to enter or leave the county in which they live without a reasonable excuse, such as travel for work or education. </p>

<p>In North Wales, the new local lockdown will affect around 504,000 people and will bring the number of people in the country under lockdown to more than 2.3 million.</p>

<p>It means 16 areas of the country will face some form of extra restrictions, with the majority of the other areas under lockdown located in South Wales. </p>

<p>This morning, Jim Jones of North Wales Tourism said he had seen no evidence that visitors were responsible for the spread and warned the lockdown would devastate local businesses. </p>

<p>'Business are extremely and understandably frustrated, it's another dark day,' he told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast.</p>

<p>'They have invested so much time and gone to extraordinary measures to be Covid-compliant and make everybody safe and then all of a sudden they've got to cancel bookings and tell visitors to go home.'    </p>

<p>The North East was made subject to new restrictions yesterday morning, with people banned from meeting anyone inside unless they are part of their Covid bubble. However this stopped short of a full lockdown that would shut pubs and restaurants. </p>

<p>It comes as Boris Johnson was bolstered by new figures showing the Covid infection rate has started slowing since restrictions were tightened.</p>

<p>In the strongest evidence yet that local lockdowns are working, results from the largest Covid-19 study in England found the R-rate fell from 1.7 to around 1.1 this month.</p>

<p>The director of the study by Imperial College London and Ipsos Mori said the interim findings from 80,000 participants 'reinforced the need for protective measures' to help extinguish the virus.</p>

<p>That restrictions are seemingly helping to stem the spread of Covid-19 will help the Prime Minister's case for imposing curbs to flatten the second wave.</p>

<p>The trio presented maps that starkly exposed the North-South coronavirus divide. And official data shows that the average number of positive tests each day is at least twice as high in North West England as in any other region, and that Scotland's cases are 14 times higher than they were at the beginning of August, outpacing England's outbreak.</p>

<p>An average 1,595 cases of Covid-19 are being diagnosed in the North West every day now, compared to just 150 in the South West, while Yorkshire and the Humber and the North East face the second highest infection rates. All of the 10 areas with the worst case-per-person ratios are in the north, while eight of 10 of those with the lowest are in the south. Professor Whitty said there was a 'heavy concentration' of coronavirus towards the top of England. </p>

<p>In a plea to the public the Prime Minister said: 'If we put in the work together now then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures.'</p>

<p>'I know some people will think we should give up and let the virus take its course despite the huge loss of life that would potentially entail. I have to say I profoundly disagree. I don't think that is what the British people want. I don't think they want to throw in the sponge. They want to fight and defeat this virus and that is what we are going to do.' </p>

<p>'Even as we fight Covid, it is vital that people get all the treatment they need for other conditions. But I must be clear, if the NHS were to be overwhelmed by covid, then no-one could get any such care.' </p>

<p>Highlighting the sharp rise in infections and defending his recent comments warning that the UK could see 50,000 coronavirus cases a day by mid-October, Sir Patrick said grimly: 'Things are definitely going in the wrong direction.' </p>

<p>Professor Whitty slapped back at critics, saying they had accused him of being 'too optimistic and too pessimistic on numbers'. But he said that in March the government failed to recognise how fast the virus was spreading and the mistake could not be repeated. In a gloomy message, he said: 'We have a long winter ahead of us.' </p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock was told to 'get his facts straight' today after shooting down vitamin D as a potential coronavirus treatment despite a growing body of evidence from around the world suggesting it works.</p>

<p>Experts have for months been calling for officials to look into the immune system-boosting nutrient's effect on Covid-19 patients after a mountain of research showed a link to vitamin D deficiency.</p>

<p>Mr Hancock told the House of Commons last week he had green-lit a Government-funded 'trial' investigating vitamin D and that it did not 'appear to have any impact'.</p>

<p>But officials have since admitted that no clinical trials had taken place and claim it was a slip of the tongue from the health secretary - who was also staunchly opposed to face masks in the spring and claimed they were 'extremely weak' in stopping Covid-19's spread.</p>

<p>According to national surveys in the UK, roughly one in five people have low vitamin D levels, the equivalent of 13million Brits.</p>

<p>Mr Hancock has now agreed to meet experts to to hear the growing case for the vitamin, which the body produces when exposed to the sun. But his flippant dismissal of vitamin D has sparked fury among scientists and MPs who today said time is running out for ministers to act, as levels of the 'sunshine vitamin' drop dramatically in autumn and winter.</p>

<p>Experts said his comments 'displayed incredible ignorance', while Liberal Democrat MP Layla Morgan told MailOnline the secretary of state 'needs to be listening, not dismissing'. She added: 'I hope Matt Hancock will take a less flippant approach to potential treatments in future and get his facts straight before making such comments. We're in a crisis, it's time for politicians to stop playing science and listen to the experts.'</p>

<p>Data presented by Professor Whitty in the televised briefing showed a clear north-south divide in the coronavirus infections across England. </p>

<p>The scientific advisers admitted the top half of the country is clearly worse affected than the bottom, but insisted 'it would be wrong' to think the problem isn't nationwide.</p>

<p>A heat map of infection rates across the country showed that almost all of the South West, South East, East Midlands and the East of England were shaded in the lightest possible colour, meaning the numbers of cases are below the average for England.</p>

<p>The average infection rate for the country as a whole was 35.7 cases per 100,000 as at Public Health England's latest official update last Friday.</p>

<p>Colour-coding showed the problem is worst in the North West around Liverpool and Manchester and also in the far North East, towards Newcastle. </p>

<p>Much of those two regions and the West Midlands - and to a lesser extent London and Cornwall - were shown in a darker colour, indicating case rates are near or above average.  </p>

<p>Professor Whitty said: 'At this point in time there is a very heavy concentration in particular areas - in particular in the North West, the North East and parts of the Midlands…</p>

<p>'There's a general increase [in the rate of infection] across the whole of England and the same is also true in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland… but a very rapid increase in particular areas; again, particularly in the North East, North West and areas of the Midlands [but] not exclusively.' </p>

<p>Numbers of positive tests reported by the Department of Health reflect what was shown in the map, with the North West reporting significantly more cases than any other region.</p>

<p>In the week up to September 23 - the most recent data available - there were an average of 1,595 cases diagnosed each day in the crisis-hit region.</p>

<p>This was more than double the 663 daily average in Yorkshire and the Humber, three times as high as the 564 in the West Midlands and 551 in the North East.</p>

<p>It blows the more southern regions, except London (471 per day), out of the water.</p>

<p>In the East Midlands there were 274 cases per day over the same seven-day period, along with 227 in the South East, 185 in the East of England and just 150 in the South West.</p>

<p>This means that the looming threat of a national lockdown, which Mr Johnson yesterday said he didn't want to resort to but would if he had to, places millions of people at risk of being lumped under tight restrictions because of the actions of people hundreds of miles away.</p>

<p>MPs have already cautioned against 'broad brush' tactics that see people in less-affected areas unfairly punished.</p>

<p>But Sir Patrick Vallance insisted: 'It would be wrong to take from this that this is a problem that's only in certain areas.</p>

<p>'It is worse in certain areas but there is evidence of spread everywhere, and we need to be mindful of that and everyone needs to take precautions across the country.'  </p>

<p>Revealed: All the areas of England, Scotland and Wales that have been hit by tougher local restrictions because of a spike in Covid-19 cases </p>

<p>The map of Britain's coronavirus rules: As confusion reigns, where can you meet friends for a pint inside or outside? And will the lockdown police ask you for a 'reasonable excuse'? </p>

<p>Britain's complex coronavirus rules have confused even the Prime Minister as numerous different restrictions are put in place across the country to try and keep the number of coronavirus cases down.</p>

<p>Aside from the standard rules in England, eight different regions have additional restrictions or rules that differ from those in place in England.</p>

<p>In total around 16.6m people in the UK are subject to local lockdowns, one quarter of the population.</p>

<p>Among the subtle differences are those between different local lockdown areas in England. For example in the North East, residents are legally banned from meeting people from outside their households inside pubs - but are free to do so outdoors. </p>

<p>In Bolton pubs and restaurants have been closed completely and can do takeout only while funerals and weddings are limited to six people. In the North East the weddings and funeral limit remains 15.   </p>

<p>The devolved regions also have different rules. The rule of six applies to children in England, but not to under 12s in Scotland and under-11s in Wales. </p>

<p>In Scotland the rule of six is limited to people from two households in Scotland. Residents are not allowed to host guests in their own homes, if the guests are from outside their household or support bubble. </p>

<p>In Wales the rule of six is limited to people of up to four households indoors. Outdoors, people can gather in groups of up to 30 but should maintain social distancing from people from other households.</p>

<p>In Welsh local lockdown areas people can meet in their own gardens in groups of up to 30, but in English local lockdown areas the rules apply to gardens as a well as inside homes. Welsh people are also banned from leaving local lockdown areas unless they have a 'reasonable excuse'. </p>

<p>Welsh wedding ceremonies do not have a limit on the number of attendees, but they must wear masks including the bride and groom. Welsh wedding receptions are limited to 30 people.  </p>

<p>These are the rules: </p>

<p>England:</p>

<p>Social gatherings </p>

<p>No more than six people are permitted to gather indoors or outdoors - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work, or 'exceptional life events'.</p>

<p>Children are not exempt from the rules, unlike in Wales and Scotland </p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions mean fines of £200 (£100 if paid within 14 days), doubling for each incident up to £3,200. </p>

<p>Pubs and Restaurants </p>

<p>Pubs and restaurants across England must close at 10pm. The rule of six still applies but applies to each group inside - not the venue as a whole. </p>

<p>Venues are now 'legally required' to take and keep the contact details of a member from every group of visitors for 21 days. This is so they can pass them on to NHS Test and Trace 'without delay' if needed.</p>

<p>The hospitality venue could face a fine if it fails to stick to the Covid security standards and the Government pledged to back local authorities to make 'further and faster use of their powers' against venues who break the rules. </p>

<p>Covid-19 secure venues, such as places of worship, restaurants and hospitality venues, can still host larger numbers in total but groups of up to six must not mix or form larger groups.</p>

<p>Travel</p>

<p>The rule of six limit does not apply to strangers gathering in the same space, such as a train or bus.</p>

<p>Government guidelines say: 'You can help control coronavirus and travel safely by walking and cycling, if you can. However, where this is not possible, you can use public transport or drive. </p>

<p>'If you do use public transport, you must wear a face covering and you should follow the safer travel guidance for passengers.'</p>

<p>Schools  </p>

<p>Face masks not required in schools outside local lockdown areas. Face masks are required for school pupils in Year 7 or above in communal areas in areas where local lockdowns are in place.  </p>

<p>Work  </p>

<p>The six person limit does not apply to gatherings for work. Offices should take steps to ensure social distancing is maintained.</p>

<p>The government initially urged workers to return to the office, but has since U-turned and called for anyone who can work from home to do so to try to drive down the number of cases.</p>

<p>Sport </p>

<p>You can continue to take part in organised sporting or licensed physical activity in groups of more than 6 outdoors and up to 6 people indoors (for over 18s). </p>

<p>Organised dance and exercise classes can take place in groups of more than six, but you must not mix with more than five other participants. </p>

<p>Masks</p>

<p>Face coverings have to be worn on public transport, in shops and supermarkets. They are also needed in other indoor venues such as museums, cinemas, galleries and places of worship.</p>

<p>The government also advised people to where them wherever they cannot keep to social distancing guidelines.</p>

<p>Hospitality and retail workers now have to wear face coverings at work, as well as passengers in taxis.</p>

<p>Weddings and Funerals  </p>

<p>Weddings are limited to 15 people and funerals are limited to 30 people. Staff working at these events are not included.   </p>

<p>North East and Liverpool:</p>

<p>Seven local authorities in the North East and Liverpool are subject to some of the strictest restrictions, which came into force on Wednesday. The affected areas are:</p>

<p>How are the rules different to the rest of England?  </p>

<p>Social gatherings</p>

<p>Residents are legally banned from meeting friends who are not in their household or support bubble indoors. This includes in their homes or gardens, pubs and restaurants. But it does not include anywhere outdoors including pub beer gardens. </p>

<p>The police will be able to take action against those who break these rules, including asking people to disperse and issuing fixed penalty notices starting at £200 for those who participate in illegal gatherings. </p>

<p>While the rules do not ban people from meeting under the rule of six outside, the government advice states residents should not 'socialise with people you do not live with'. It also advises against visiting care home residents. </p>

<p>Pubs and Restaurants </p>

<p>Travel</p>

<p>Public transport is restricted to 'essential trips', be it work or school or looking after an elderly relative. Going outside the area is also restricted to 'essential' reasons.</p>

<p>Weddings and Funerals</p>

<p>Same as the rest of the country. </p>

<p>Bolton*</p>

<p>Are there any loopholes?</p>

<p>Despite vast swathes of England, Scotland and Wales being under some form of local lockdown, there are some loopholes people could exploit.</p>

<p>Get a pint after 10pm</p>

<p>Punters can still get their hands on a draft pint after 10pm if they use establishments at motorway services because they are classed as an essential service.</p>

<p>The Hope and Champion is a Wetherspoon at Beaconsfield Services on the M40, in Buckinghamshire is one pub that can still legally serve after the curfew lasting until 5am. It provides food and drink for those on the roads, so now remains open later than other pubs.</p>
