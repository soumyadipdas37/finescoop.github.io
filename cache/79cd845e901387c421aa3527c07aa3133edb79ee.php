<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jurgen Klopp has opened up on his mischievous 4am text message he sent to Sir Alex Ferguson on the night Liverpool were crowned champions of England once again.</p>

<p>Klopp contacted the former Manchester United manager in the small hours, waking the Scotsman from his sleep.</p>

<p>Now, on the eve of the Premier League's return, Klopp has revealed what really happened and how himself and the legendary former manager came into contact. </p>

<p>After lifting the title with Liverpool, Jurgen Klopp received a text from Sir Alex Ferguson</p>

<p>The legendary former manager congratulated Klopp, but got a response in the small hours</p>

<p>'I didn't call him, I have to clarify that. I sent him a message,' a smiling Klopp told reporters at his pre-match press conference ahead of Liverpool hosting Leeds United.</p>

<p>'The problem was that I came back late in my room that night obviously and I couldn't sleep immediately, so I went back through the messages I got and one of them was from Alex Ferguson.</p>

<p>'And so I just reply in a very polite way I think. I think it was 3.30, four o'clock round about.'</p>

<p>Klopp revealed he was simply caught up in the moment and wanted to get back to all those who had wished him well, but did not consider that the 78-year-old Ferguson would have his phone set on loud.</p>

<p>Klopp ended Liverpool's 30-year wait for the title and was up until 3.30am celebrating</p>

<p>'I didn't expect him having the phone by his bed actually, I didn't want to wake him up but if that happened, sorry Alex!,' Klopp added.</p>

<p>'Since then we were not in contact, he's still the former Man United manager I don't think he wants to talk to me too much about the success of Liverpool. </p>

<p>'He respects it but it's not his favourite thing to watch on television.'</p>

<p>Klopp goes up against Marcelo Bielsa on Saturday at Anfield, as Liverpool begin their title defence with a late kick-off against the newly promoted victors of the Championship.</p>

<p>Earlier this week Klopp spoke of his admiration for Bielsa and his eagerness to speak with the Argentine, though joked that the language barrier may be an issue.</p>

<p>'My Spanish is pretty random, I'd love to have a conversation with him which would be nice, but I don't speak Spanish apart from ordering a beer and I don't know how his English is meanwhile,' said the Liverpool boss.</p>

<p>'So that's a bit of a shame, but apart from that I just couldn't have more respect for what he is doing to be honest.</p>

<p>'What a guy. The team, the style, how they play will suit them even more for the Premier League than for the Championship one hundred percent.'</p>
