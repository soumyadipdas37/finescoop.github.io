<p>Melania has been heavily criticized for some of her fashion choices. In June 2018 she sparked outrage for wearing a Zara jacket with the phrase, 'I really don’t care, do u?' while visiting detention centers holding migrant children at the border in Texas.</p>

<p>Twitter users slammed Harris for copying Melania's style as she was spotted wearing a green jacket, white shirt, jeans and Timberland boots in Iraq in 2018, an outfit not so different from what Harris wore Tuesday</p>

<p>However, some noted that Harris has worn these shoes before. She was spotted wearing the same boots in August last year and during the primary this year.</p>

<p>Many praised Harris for her cool look and for sporting the workwear Timberland boots, which gained popularity in the 90s with the New York rap scene worn by the likes of Tupac, Aaliyah, Wu-Tang Clan and rapped about by the Notorious B.I.G.</p>

<p>Meena Harris, Kamaka’s niece shared a video of Harris dismounting the plane Tuesday in California with the caption: 'THE TIMBS THO'. </p>

<p>'The <?php echo e('@'); ?>KamalaHarris de-planing videos &amp; her completely appropriate self-confidence every time are quickly becoming one of my favorite things about this campaign,' one Twitter user added.</p>

<p>'Kamala Harris in California being Vice Presidential with her Timberlands,' another added.</p>

<p>Social media users speculated that Harris brought out the Timberlands in an satorial campaign to appear more casual and approachable with voters.  </p>
