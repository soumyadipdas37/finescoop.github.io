<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The creators of Spitting Image have been blasted for giving Jewish billionaire Mark Zuckerberg's puppet a hooked nose.</p>

<p>The Facebook founder, 36, is set to feature in a revived version of the cult show on Britbox on October 3.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg was given a 'gratuitously large, hooked nose and ghoulish appearance', according to the Campaign Against Antisemitism.</p>

<p>Spitting Image exaggerates the characteristics of royals and celebrities to make a mockery of the establishment. </p>

<p>But campaigners said choosing to highlight Mr Zuckerberg's nose rather than his 'multiple eyebags' and 'saggy chin' was a classic sign of antisemitism. </p>

<p>Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, 36, is set to feature in a revived version of the cult show on Britbox on October 3</p>

<p>One took to Twitter to say: 'Exaggerating physical features is Spitting Image's shtick.</p>

<p>'And yet Mark Zuckerberg has incredible multiple eye bags and a sagging chin that aren't caricatured.</p>

<p>'But the hooked nose he doesn't have, is, almost like their caricaturists don't know how to portray Jews without one.' </p>

<p>Spitting Image was a hit satirical TV show in the 1980s that showed wax puppets of famous faces with exaggerated features mocking contemporary issues.</p>

<p>Mr Zuckerberg was given a 'gratuitously large, hooked nose and ghoulish appearance', according to the Campaign Against Antisemitism. Pictured, celebrating his anniversary with his wife Priscilla Chan</p>

<p>A spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemism said: 'Spitting Image should explain why a Jewish personality has been caricatured to appear with a gratuitously large, hooked nose and ghoulish appearance.</p>

<p>'When in real life Mark Zuckerberg is not associated with either of those physical features.</p>

<p>'Satire is integral to comedy and a vital part of our public conversation, but it should be based in reality and not on lazy and offensive stereotypes.' </p>

<p>Campaigners said choosing to highlight Mr Zuckerberg's nose rather than his 'multiple eyebags' and 'saggy chin' was a classic sign of antisemitism</p>

<p>Another campaigner took to Twitter to compare the caricature with Nazi propaganda used to 'stir up hatred against Jews' in the 1930s and 1940s.</p>

<p>Adam Creme wrote: 'A photo of Mark Zuckerberg and his Spitting Image puppet.</p>

<p>'The portrayal of exaggerated hooked noses was a key tactic of Nazi propaganda to stir up hatred against Jews.'</p>

<p>Others chose to make light of it, with one saying: 'The only controversial thing about the Mark Zuckerberg Spitting Image puppet is that it looks more like Chris Martin than Mark Zuckerberg.' </p>

<p>On Friday, September 11, it was confirmed a new series featuring 100 new puppets will debut next month.</p>
