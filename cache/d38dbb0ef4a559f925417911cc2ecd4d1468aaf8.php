<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>They might be more at home in the wilds of Ethiopia, but this gelada seemed happy enough relaxing at his home near Bristol yesterday.</p>

<p>The magnificent beast, technically a monkey though often called a baboon, was pictured frolicking on his deck at the Wild Place Project, a conservation park in south Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>The family-run park has six males, ranging in age from 10-year-old Kito to 18-year-old Hobbit. Geladas are also known as 'bleeding-heart monkeys' due to the red patch on their chests.</p>

<p>Their thick coats protect them from the extremes of temperatures in the mountains of northern Ethiopia, but also come in handy if it gets a bit blowy off the River Avon.</p>

<p>And judging by the yawn this one let out, they keep you the perfect temperature for an afternoon nap.</p>

<p>Monkeying around: The gelada lets out a beast of a yawn as he relaxes in his enclosure at the Wild Place Project</p>

<p>Tiring work: He rolls over contemplating life at the family-run conservation park on the outskirts of Bristol</p>

<p>Happy days: Normally found in the mountains of northern Ethiopia, this male is one of six at the Gloucestershire wildlife park</p>

<p>Content: He is all smiles as he lets the world pass him by upside down, showing off the flash of red on his chest that gives the breed the nickname 'bleeding heart monkeys'</p>
