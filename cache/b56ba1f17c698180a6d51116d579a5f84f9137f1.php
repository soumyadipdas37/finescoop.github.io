<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A female driver has penned a scathing note to her local parking inspector begging him not to issue her 'another' $100 fine. </p>

<p>The woman left the message on her windshield after parking outside the University of Queensland campus in Brisbane suburb Kelvin Grove.</p>

<p>But her plea appears to have been ignored, with a photo posted on Reddit showing a ticket tucked under the driver's windscreen wiper. </p>

<p>'Dear Mr Parking Inspector,' the note reads. </p>

<p>A female driver has penned a scathing note to her local parking inspector begging him not to issue her 'another' $100 fine</p>

<p>'It is not my financial responsibility if Brisbane council have technical problems.</p>

<p>'I am a resident in this shi***** street.</p>

<p>'You might feel good to not be an a***hole today.</p>

<p>'Kind regards, Kel.'</p>

<p>The poster accused the driver of having parked in a disabled car park. </p>

<p>But closer inspection of the parking limits on the street show it is possible they parked in a 15 minute car park. </p>

<p>Some locals were sympathetic with the driver, claiming a move to digitise parking permits had created problems for residential parking. </p>

<p>'BCC stopped issuing parking permits to residents, moving to a digital system,' another resident wrote.</p>

<p>But her plea appears to have been ignored, with a photo posted on Reddit showing a ticket tucked under the driver's windscreen wiper</p>

<p>'I've had a go at the parking inspector in my area for doing it, for ticketing a car that has the old interim permit in the window that has barely moved in 6 months. </p>

<p>'Got a snarky reply that his job is to scan plates and write tickets.' </p>

<p>A Brisbane City Council spokesperson refuted the claims.  </p>

<p>'There are no technical issues with Council's digital permit system,' a Brisbane City Council spokesperson told 7NEWS.com.au. </p>

<p>'Digital permits are effective immediately upon lodgement of an application.</p>

<p>'Residents will be notified if their application is subsequently refused before the digital permit is no longer valid.' </p>

<p>Some argued the driver may have deserved the fine.</p>

<p>'I don't think it's a disabled spot. I can see the infringement notice has the words 'parked longer than,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'If that's the case looks like the ticket is fine. That 1/4hr sign doesn't have a "resident permits excepted" note like the ones further up the hill,' another agreed. </p>

<p>Others said her choice of words probably didn't help her case.</p>

<p>'Wow, if I was a parking inspector that note would definitely make me find an excuse to fine her. Really pulling at the heartstrings with that one,' one said. </p>
