<p>Backup eventually arrives and several officers are seen tackling the other man to the ground before quickly subduing him</p>

<p>Footage of the incident was posted anonymously on social media yesterday and has been viewed more than 70,000 times.</p>

<p>It shows a male and a female police officer speaking to a man at the side of the road, who tells them: 'I don't give a f***. You gonna arrest me? Go on, then.'</p>

<p>They take hold of him and the female officer appears to take out a spray canister, as angry bystanders shout: 'He hasn't even done nothing. Why you spraying him?'</p>

<p>As the officers drag the suspect towards their car, they are confronted by a man and a woman who try to stop the arrest.</p>

<p>The female officer orders them to 'get back' and appears to spray the man as he advances towards her.</p>

<p>Her colleague warns 'there'll be more officers' as the scene become more chaotic and two male suspects are seen wrestling with police in the street.</p>

<p>The officers grapple with the mob, before the female PC desperately radios for back-up</p>

<p>One of them then appears to hit the officer in the face, sending his glasses clattering to the ground.</p>

<p>The other suspect - who was previously sprayed - howls in pain as he clutches his face, unable to see, and is heard furiously thumping the police car.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, backup arrives and several officers are seen tackling the other man to the ground before quickly subduing him.</p>

<p>Superintendent James Baker, of West Mercia Police, said: 'This incident is unacceptable. </p>

<p>'My colleagues were on patrol, keeping the community safe - we do not come to work to be assaulted. </p>

<p>'This type of behaviour will not be tolerated in Telford and we will be increasing the number of uniformed patrols in the area.</p>

<p>'This was undoubtedly a very distressing incident for anyone who witnessed it and I am pleased we made four arrests, having gained control of the incident quickly. </p>

<p>'Our staff are committed to keeping the public safe and these events will not deter police from patrolling the area and continuing to do their jobs. </p>

<p>'All our officers are dedicated to their roles and we will continue to engage with the communities we serve and be there when they are in need.'</p>
