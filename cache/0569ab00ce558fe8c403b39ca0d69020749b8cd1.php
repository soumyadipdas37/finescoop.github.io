<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Year 12 student has listed her exclusive girls' sprawling school for sale as part of an elaborate muck-up day prank. </p>

<p>A sale sign boasting 53 bedrooms, 47 bathrooms and 20 car spots appeared outside Queenwood School for Girls in Mosman in Sydney's lower north shore on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>The sign, which points out the school is just 'moments away' from popular clothing store Country Road and already has DA approval for a nightclub and brewery, was so realistic that residents in the affluent suburb thought it was real.</p>

<p>Leaving student Sophie Nell enlisted the help of her real estate agent neighbour, Megan Thomas, to create the 'for sale' sign. </p>

<p>Queenwood Year 12 Student Sophie Nell (pictured dressed as an old lady for muck-up day with real estate agent Megan Thomas) listed her school for sale for $150million</p>

<p>'Mistaken as a prison, this post-modern industrial complex invites new family owners to call this place ''home'',' the listing hanging outside the $26,000-a-year school reads.</p>

<p>'DA approved for nightclub 24/7, brewery, minimum security prison or just a humble Mosman home.</p>

<p>'This is a brilliant opportunity to maximise views, location and only moments to Country Road.'</p>

<p>Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, Ms Thomas from O'Gorman &amp; Partners Mosman said she had been approached by Sophie's dad about an idea for muck-up day due to kick off on Thursday.</p>

<p>'We were very excited to help. With the kids under so much pressure with COVID-19 and restrictions there's no real outlet so it was great to see the school get on board and allow them to have a little glimmer of hope and fun before the HSC,' she said.</p>

<p>'I come from a PR background so for me it was a really great opportunity to do something fun and creative and obviously the office was very supportive.'</p>

<p>Ms Nell designed the sign with the help of Ms Thomas with the school being held open for inspections on Thursday </p>

<p>The listing for the Mosman school said the building had been approved for a 24/7 nightclub and a brewery</p>

<p>Ms Thomas said Sophie had come up with the idea and selling features of the school and her office helped put the template together.</p>

<p>Remarkably, the agent said she had even received a few calls from potential buyers.</p>

<p>'We had a neighbour that said they were very happy the school was going and we've had a couple of people call and say they thought it was real,' Ms Thomas laughed.</p>

<p>'I'm waiting for some calls from a few developers.' </p>

<p>Driving past the sign on Wednesday morning, Ms Thomas said a crowd had already gathered to have a look - including the teachers who thought it was 'fantastic'.</p>

<p>Sophie has provided her details on the listing and will be hosting an open house inspection for any hopeful buyers on Thursday.   </p>

<p>A photo of the school was shared to Mosman Collective's Instagram page generating dozens of comments congratulating the students.</p>

<p>'So great to see the enjoyment and creativity coming through in what's been a trying year for Year 12's ... hilarious!' one parent said.</p>
