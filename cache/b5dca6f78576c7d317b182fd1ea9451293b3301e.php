<p>Bodybuilder and activewear businessman Clinton Chadwick, 31, is best known for posting photographs of himself wearing little but his tattoos.</p>

<p>But the social media sensation recently sparked a wave of concern from his followers when he began describing himself as a vegan shaman 'psychonaut' and posting spiritual memes.</p>

<p>Last Wednesday, Chadwick was charged by NSW Police with allegedly assaulting, choking and intimidating a woman in the beachside suburb of Bondi. </p>

<p>There were dramatic scenes when officers went to arrest him in Surry Hills, with one viewer telling Daily Mail Australia: 'He streamed the whole thing to his (Instagram) stories.'</p>

<p>'It went for ages, must have been like 20 stories.'</p>

<p>Chadwick is left and right with Hossein 'Yakiboy' Balapour, his business associate</p>

<p>Court documents said Chadwick allegedly assaulted a female constable during the 'execution of her duty' between 9.45pm and 11pm and allegedly resisted arrest.</p>

<p>He was eventually taken to Waverley Police Station where he was charged with a series of domestic violence related offences against the Bondi woman, including assault occasioning actual bodily harm. </p>

<p>The footage of his arrest sparked a wave of confused and concerned comments from followers. 'Wow what the hell just happened?' one asked.</p>

<p>Others added Chadwick had a 'beautiful soul' and said: 'I hope he is getting help and support regardless of what he believes or says on social media'.</p>

<p>Chadwick runs a gym-focused activewear company, RIG FIT, with fellow Insta-sensation Hossein 'Yakiboy' Balapour one of his long-time brand ambassadors. </p>

<p>Chadwick runs an activewear business and has garnered a large following for his social media muscle photos</p>

<p>In an interview with Channel Seven's Sunday Night program in 2018, Chadwick suggested he had a troubled youth but 'it pushed me in the right direction.  </p>

<p>'I was bad, but I think you're a product of your environment,' he said. </p>

<p>Chadwick was brought before Waverley Local Court last Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Magistrate Ross Hudson ordered he be detained and undergo a mental health assessment at hospital.  </p>

<p>He is yet to enter any pleas. The case will return to court at a later date. </p>
