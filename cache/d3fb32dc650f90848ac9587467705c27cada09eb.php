<p>Highways leading out of Melbourne on Friday have been clogged with cars as ordinary citizens attempt to travel out of the metropolitan area to work. </p>

<p>Traffic headed into Geelong, southwest of Melbourne, stretched back for 13 kilometres all the way from Little River to past Werribee as police performed identity checks on motorists. </p>

<p>Police continue to cause Melburnians pain at checkpoints around the city</p>

<p>Traffic on the freeway leading to Geelong out of Melbourne on Friday stretched back for 13 kilometres </p>

<p>Under the regional travel crackdown under COVOD-19 restrictions, Victorian who leave a restricted area without a lawful excuse will be handed a $4957 fine.</p>

<p>The new law came into effect at midnight on Wednesday, with drivers warned to expect long delays.</p>

<p>On the other side of town, motorists attempting to travel along Sydney Road towards the Hume Highway were also trapped. </p>

<p>Similar scenes were taking place near Ballarat on the Western Highway - west of Melbourne. </p>

<p>A day earlier, motorists in country Victoria reported equally frustrating delays as traffic near Nar Nar Goon came to a stand still. </p>

<p>Police have said they will attempt to stop every vehicle at the seven permanent checkpoints and at a new mobile stop along the Mornington Peninsula, which remains in Stage Four lockdown despite being on the other side of Port Phillip Bay among farms and vineyards.</p>

<p>Social media was awash with comments from angry motorists, whom have enjoyed near empty highways now for weeks during Stage Four lockdown. </p>

<p>Many motorists entering the areas carry work permits allowing them access into the COVID-free regional areas. </p>

<p>Melbourne remains under draconian Stage Four lockdown, which limits movement to within five kilometres of a resident's home without a work permit. </p>

<p>Police are also patrolling country backroads after crafty Melburnians were caught bypassing their initial roadblocks earlier this year. </p>

<p>Officers are also checking buses and country V-Line trains as well as using number plate recognition software.</p>

<p>“They love to have visitors - but they love to be virus-free,” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Permitted workers, including some truck drivers, will be allowed to pass through the checkpoints, but will not be exempt from the wait times.</p>

<p>Deputy Commissioner of Regional Operations Rick Nugent said more vehicles would be stopped at border checkpoints including all vehicles towing campervans, boats, jetskis, fishing gear or swags.</p>

<p>'There will be delays at these checkpoints and for that I am sorry but we have to do all we can to ensure people from metropolitan Melbourne don’t travel to these areas,' he said.</p>

<p>'They love to have visitors - but they love to be virus-free,' Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said on Wednesday. </p>

<p>On Thursday, photographs showed how a part of Melbourne's ring of steel was left unattended by police because of heavy rain.</p>

<p>The image showed the Little River checkpoint on the Princes Freeway near Geelong unmanned due to wet weather.</p>

<p>It was captured about 8.30am, while cars continued to travel past the dreary and unchecked barrier.</p>

<p>On Friday, it had some Melburnians stuck in traffic praying for rain.  </p>
