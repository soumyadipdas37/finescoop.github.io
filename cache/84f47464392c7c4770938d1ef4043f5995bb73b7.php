<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Laura Dern took part in an Instagram Live last week, from her home in Los Angeles - even though she was thought to be in the UK shooting the latest Jurassic World sequel.</p>

<p>The actress has been filming at Pinewood Studios, England, with her original Jurassic Park co-stars Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum - returning as a trio for the first time in the sixth film in the franchise.</p>

<p>But Laura, 53, cropped up on Instagram on Friday, taking part in a live chat with former UN ambassador Samantha Power, in support of presidential candidate Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Is Laura Dern KILLED OFF in Jurassic World: Dominion? The actress [pictured in 1993's Jurassic Park] has returned home to LA while her co-stars Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum remain in the UK shooting the dinosaur sequel</p>

<p>This came as a surprise to many fans watching the broadcast who had believed her to be in England, and many asked her about it in the comments.</p>

<p>But Laura and Samantha focused on politics, leaving the dinosaur chat out of it and Laura's return a mystery.</p>

<p>This begs the question - does her character, Dr Ellie Sattler - meet a sticky end in Jurassic World: Dominion.</p>

<p>Co-stars Sam and Jeff - who play Dr Alan Grant and Dr Ian Malcolm respectively - are meanwhile still together in the UK - even uploading a video of the pair of them performing a duet on the piano on Monday.</p>

<p>But Laura's return to Hollywood suggests her role in the new film is smaller than her co-stars, or that she has merely completed shooting so she can return to other projects in America.</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached Dern's rep for comment. </p>

<p>If her role is watered down for Jurassic World: Dominion, does this mean a dinosaur finally gets the better of Dr Sattler.</p>

<p>Goldblum has already teased the first scene he shot with Neill and Dern as they returned to the franchise. </p>

<p>And it sounds like it was a life or death scenario.</p>

<p>Killed off? Goldblum has already teased a life or death scene with Dern, saying, 'it was me and Laura and Sam in a jeep. I can't tell you any more about it, but it was very thrilling' [pictured in a 2018 ad for Jeep]</p>

<p>'It was a very thrilling day on set,' he told Entertainment Weekly. 'It was me and Laura and Sam in a jeep. I can't tell you any more about it, but it was very thrilling.'</p>

<p>He elaborated to Insider: 'The first thing that we shot... it was a scene with me and Laura Dern and Sam Neil and we were — I can't tell you much — but we were all day in a very tight, enclosed space.</p>

<p>'You'll see — it's a mystery you'll solve when you see [the movie]. The three of us were in a tiny little space and we were being menaced by — I can't even tell you — a surprising faction of prehistoric creatures that you've never seen before.' </p>

<p>Fate? If her role is watered down for Jurassic World: Dominion, does this mean a dinosaur finally gets the better of Dr Sattler?</p>

<p>Wrapped up? Laura's return to Hollywood suggests her role in the new film is smaller than her co-stars, or that she has merely completed shooting so she can return to other projects in America [pictured in January]</p>

<p>If Dr Sattler - who, in Jurassic Park I survived attacks from Velociraptors and a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and in Jurassic Park III saved the day from afar - does get killed off, it's likely to be near the end of the new film, as Neill previously told The Guardian: 'We're all the way through the film, Jeff, and me, and Laura.'</p>

<p>He was sure to assure fans that the trio of scientists - who will join newer stars of the franchise Bryce Dallas Howard and Chris Pratt in dealing with a troupe of dinosaurs loose on the mainland - will be involved in the action scenes.</p>

<p>'I can't give anything away, but a real-life dinosaur is a compelling thing to someone who has devoted his life to them,' he said of his paleontologist character's return. 'There will be screaming. We know this.'    </p>
