<p>This comes a week after Channel Seven confirmed they had acquired rights for the signing series' upcoming tenth season.</p>

<p>It was reported last month that Nine had 'failed to renew its contract' for the 2021 season of The Voice, and Seven jumped on the licence 'very quickly'.</p>

<p>Warburton already has big changes in mind for the show, including cutting the number of episodes and having a tighter production schedule.</p>

<p>'We have a whole new more efficient and cost-effective streamlined production and roll-out schedule which will concentrate the format over less episodes and shoot over a much shorter time frame,' he said.</p>

<p>International coaches Kelly Rowland and Boy George will likely leave the show, and it's unclear what will happen to Aussie judges Delta Goodrem and Guy Sebastian.</p>
