<p>‘It was a watershed moment,’ said Robinson of England women’s thrilling 50-over final victory over India three years ago, the fruition of the leap he took to become their coach.</p>

<p>‘Lord’s was sold out with touts outside. The ground was full of parents and kids, young voices cheering on both sides.</p>

<p>Mark Robinson was all smiles as he recalled the day he became a World Cup winner</p>

<p>‘The next day we were back at Lord’s and I bumped into the MCC chief executive. He was telling me what a different crowd it was. They had to shut half the men’s toilets and open them up for women because the queues were so long. People talk about the Hundred but women’s cricket has long been attracting the ‘new’ audience the game wants.’</p>

<p>The memories came flooding back for the man who coached Sussex to two County Championship titles and became a candidate to lead England’s men before he became women’s coach as he watched a re-run of that extraordinary Lord’s day on Sky.</p>

<p>Now Robinson, out of the full-time coaching scene since his spell with England women came to an abrupt end last year, could be poised for a return to Hove for a second spell as coach, with Jason Gillespie leaving to take over South Australia.</p>

<p>‘The thing that hits me whenever I see highlights, and I think Anya Shrubsole mentioned it on TV near the end of the re-run, is how far out of it we were for large parts of the India innings,’ said Robinson.</p>

<p>‘At the time I always felt we were going to win because we seemed to be creating chances and the run-rate never really changed. But when you look at the scoreboard cold again you think ‘crikey, how did we get away with that?’ It was a great day.’</p>

<p>Yet there was no role for Robinson, 53, in Sky’s brilliant ‘watchalong’ coverage – even though captain Heather Knight made sure he was part of the team’s WhatsApp group swapping memories on the day – because what had been a highly successful stint with an improving England women’s team came to that sudden and unexpected halt.</p>

<p>Last summer, after England’s Ashes defeat against an outstanding Australian team, Robinson was summoned to a de-brief with head of women’s cricket Clare Connor. To the surprise of most in the game the former Yorkshire bowler was shown the door.</p>

<p>‘I never thought I was coming to the end, I don’t think you ever do as a coach,’ admitted Robinson. ‘The Ashes were a big disappointment but the group had not fragmented. We were putting things in place to make the team more self-reliant and less coach dependent and the sadness of it was that I think it was all coming together. But when I sat down with Clare it became obvious she felt it was time for change.’ </p>

<p>Ultimately, the 12-4 multi-format Ashes defeat was just too comprehensive for the man who masterminded that World Cup triumph to survive. ‘We came up against a very good Australia team who were in a very good place,’ said Robinson.</p>

<p>Robinson, who will be watching England women take on West Indies in the first of five Twenty20 internationals at Derby on Monday with interest, could be forgiven bitterness but the man who was being talked of as a possible successor to Trevor Bayliss has, a year on, a surprising take on what was effectively his sacking.</p>

<p>‘When you have stepped away from the emotion of it all, and with hindsight, I can appreciate that four years is a good run,’ Robinson tells Sportsmail. ‘To be able to have that cycle is good and I left the group in a better place than when we came in. The change was probably good for the team too. Lisa Keightley (the new coach) will do it differently. She’ll take it on again as every new coach does.</p>

<p>‘I learnt loads from working in that job, coaching different players in global tournaments, and, this really is with hindsight, but I think it’s the best thing that could have happened to me. It has taken time to appreciate that.’</p>

<p>Change has seen Robinson working for the last year as a consultant with various counties, associate nations and the England deaf team. ‘I didn’t want to just go back to the first job that came up so I took the advice I was given by people I respect to take some time out even though I was a little nervous about that,’ said Robinson.</p>

<p>‘Then I was getting busy with consultancy and hoping the right full-time job would come up so I could put my hat in the ring before everything in the world just stopped.’ Now, Sportsmail understands, he will put his hat in the ring back at Hove.</p>

<p>‘The good thing about taking time out is you re-evaluate what you’re about as a coach. I love coaching and I love helping people. In this period out I’ve coached without being in charge and I haven’t done that since I was with the second team at Sussex. You have a different relationship. What gets me out of bed in the morning is trying to help people and I’ve loved helping coaches.</p>

<p>‘I’m really comfortable in myself and what I want to do. This time out has been really good. I’ve done a mentoring course, a lot of reading and a lot of talking. Now I’m ready to go back in having had that first bit of time out since I started at 18 as a player. But it’s made me a better coach. I’ve taken stock and I see the world differently now.’</p>

<p>It would not be a surprise if the next step of Robinson’s journey takes him back to the scene of his great county successes with Sussex.</p>
