<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea midfielder Conor Gallagher has officially joined West Bromwich Albion on loan.</p>

<p>The England Under-21 international agreed a new contract with Chelsea before he travelled up to the Hawthorns to complete the formalities of his loan this afternoon.</p>

<p>Gallagher represents a major coup for Albion who tried to sign the 20-year old last season prior to him joining Swansea City on loan.</p>

<p>Conor Gallagher has joined West Brom on a season-long loan deal from Chelsea</p>

<p>After completing his loan move, Gallagher said: 'There was a lot of interest from the Premier League, which is where I wanted to play this season, but this is where I want to be.</p>

<p>'West Brom stood out to me because of the way they played last season. I played against them two or three times and I liked how they approached the game.</p>

<p>'I felt that it would suit me and it would be best for my development. I felt it could help me become the player I want to be and I'm pleased to get this agreement sorted.'</p>

<p>The Chelsea starlet has agreed a new contract with the Stamford Bridge outfit</p>

<p>Leeds United wanted to sign him in a permanent deal while Aston Villa and Newcastle also asked for him. </p>

<p>Crystal Palace thought they had a deal lined up but, with Chelsea reluctant to rush his contract talks, Palace prioritised the signing of his club-mate Michy Batshuayi instead, subsequently scuppering any deal as they are unable to have two loans from the same club.</p>

<p>Gallagher is likely to go straight into contention for Saturday's clash with in-form Everton.</p>

<p>Gallagher represents a major coup for Slaven Bilic and will likely be in squad for Everton clash</p>
