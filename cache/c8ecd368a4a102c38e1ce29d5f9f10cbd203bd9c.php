<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Maj. Bridget Hallahan, who commands the Louisville Metro police department Fifth Division, allegedly sent a message to co-workers calling BLM protesters 'punks'</p>

<p>A Louisville Metro Police major blasted Black Lives Matter protesters and Antifa as 'punks' who will always be living in their parents' basement, working in Walmart or 'washing our cars' in a message to colleagues last month. </p>

<p>Maj. Bridget Hallahan, who is white and commands the city's Fifth Division, allegedly claimed that police officers in the city and their families are also being 'doxed'.  </p>

<p>She invited cops in her division to come to her office to 'vent together' and called on them not to 'validate' the protesters or to 'make them important'.</p>

<p>Her alleged words were published by the Courier Journal Wednesday just hours before protesters erupted in anger over the decision by a Kentucky grand jury not to induct any of the three officers involved in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor with her murder. </p>

<p>'I know it is hard to keep our thoughts and opinions to ourselves sometimes, especially when we, as a whole or as an individual, become the target of people in the public who criticize what we do without even knowing the facts,' the Courier Journal says the message sent in August read. </p>

<p>'These ANTIFA and BLM people, especially the ones who just jumped on the bandwagon 'yesterday' because they became 'woke' (insert eye roll here), do not deserve a second glance or thought from us. Our little pinky toenails have more character, morals, and ethics, than these punks have in their entire body.</p>

<p>'Do not stop to their level. Do not respond to them. If we do, we only validate what they did. Don't make them important, because they are not. They will be the ones washing our cars, cashing us out at the Walmart, or living in their parents' basement playing COD for their entire life.'</p>

<p>Her message was revealed as another night of protests erupted in Louisville Wednesday</p>

<p>She said protesters will always be living in their parents' basement, working in Walmart or 'washing our cars' in a message. to her division. Pictured, officers stand in the street shortly after shots are fired at police in Louisville on Wednesday night</p>

<p>Her message was revealed Wednesday as city officials called for her removal</p>

<p>The message then made non-specific claims about the doxing of officers in the department. </p>

<p>Hallahan claimed it was happening 'merely because people just don't like being told what to do or what not to do by police'.</p>

<p>'There is currently no recourse we have for incidents involving the doxing of officers or their families,' the message reads. </p>

<p>'What we can do is speak up against them and put the truth out there. Through the PIO office and the LMPD FB page, we will come back at them on their own page to let them and everyone else know they are lying. We will print the facts. I will see to it.</p>

<p>'We have already taken care of one incident. I hope we never have to do it again. Just know I got your back,' she added. </p>

<p>DailyMail.com reached out to the Louisville Police Department for comment on the message but a representative was not available. </p>

<p>LMPD spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told the Courier Journal that the department is looking into the message and has no other comment.</p>

<p>Hallahan has been commander of the division since last July and before that, oversaw the department's training division. </p>

<p>City officials have called the message 'out of character' for her but that it still remained 'totally unacceptable'. </p>

<p>'I'm disappointed,' said Metro Councilman Brandon Coan. 'I think it's a totally unacceptable attitude of any police officer and extremely poor leadership from a major. I think she owes the community an apology and she'll have to deal with the consequences of her conduct.' </p>

<p>Hallahan was speaking about the 100-plus days of protests in Louisville sparked by the police shooting of Breonna Taylor, pictured</p>

<p>'I think it hurts the entire department,' added Councilman Bill Hollander. </p>

<p>It's making constituents wonder what kind of people we're really employing and promoting to leadership positions. And that's very unfortunate. Our police officers have a very difficult job and they don't need this kind of inappropriate communication.'</p>

<p>He recommended that Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer relieve Hallahan of her command. </p>

<p>The message emerged just hours after the Courier Journal also revealed a message from one of the officers involved in Taylor's fatal shooting in which he defended his and his colleagues'' actions.  </p>

<p>Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly, who was wounded during the shooting that claimed Taylor's life, emailed coworkers to accuse city officials of failing officers 'in epic proportions for their own gain and to cover their asses'. </p>

<p>Taylor's death sparked more than 100 days of protests in Louisville and around the country, that erupted with renewed energy on Wednesday night following the jury decision.  </p>

<p>Protests gathered across America as soon as the Kentucky grand jury's decision over Taylor's death were revealed as thousands - including Taylor's family - voiced outrage over the cops not facing murder charges. </p>

<p>A total of 13 people were arrested Wednesday night in Louisville on charges including property destruction, resisting arrest, failure to disperse and assault on a police officer. </p>

<p>Two police officers were also shot.  </p>

<p>Protests also took place in New York City, Chicago, Seattle, Portland, Atlanta, Denver, Washington D.C. and many other major cities. </p>

<p>Protesters raise their fists and signs near Jefferson Square Park in Louisville on Wednesday. The protests revived energy this week following the Breonna Taylor verdict</p>

<p>Taylor, 26, was killed on March 13 when Sgt Jonathan Mattingly and Detective Myles Cosgrove and Brett Hankison burst down the door to her home in Louisville while executing a botched late-night raid and shot her six times.</p>

<p>The black EMT died in the bungled raid after officers fired 32 rounds into her home and neighboring addresses.  </p>

<p>The search warrant for her home related to a drugs investigation over her ex-boyfriend who was not present at the property and who had been arrested at a different address earlier that night. </p>

<p>More than six months on from her killing, a grand jury returned a decision Wednesday on possible charges against the three cops, choosing to indict just one of the officers - Brett Hankison - on the lesser charges of wanton endangerment. </p>

<p>The first-degree charge, a Class D felony which carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, relates to Hankison shooting into the neighboring apartments during the incident.</p>

<p>No charges were brought against him in relation to the death of Taylor and the other two officers were not charged.  </p>
