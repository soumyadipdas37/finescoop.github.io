<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There is 'clear evidence,' that coronavirus infections are rising in children, the Office for National Statistics has claimed.</p>

<p>According to figures released yesterday, rates of infection for children aged between two and 11 are seven times higher than in July.</p>

<p>The ONS also warned that positive tests were increasing among 17 to 24-year-olds, as well as 25 to 34-year-olds. </p>

<p>It calculated that around 59,800 people in England had Covid-19 by September 10, a rise of 51 per cent from the week before. </p>

<p>Coronavirus rates among children are seven times higher than in July, figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest</p>

<p>Katherine Kent, co-head of analysis for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: 'These infections seem to be mostly focused in younger people who have seen the largest rise in infections.'</p>

<p>Cases among children up the age of 11 rose from 0.04 per cent on July 23 to 0.28 per cent on September 10. </p>

<p>For 17 to 24-year-olds the rate increased from 0.04 per cent to 0.52 per cent, while the next age bracket, which rises to 34-year-olds, went from 0.03 per cent to 0.36.</p>

<p>Yesterday Public Health England announced 'acute respiratory infections' has risen five-fold in care homes in the week to September 13 and increased more than eight times in schools after term resumed in England. </p>

<p>Despite a long-term rise since July, weekly figures from PHE in fact suggest Covid-19 cases among people in their 20s actually fell for the first time in 10 weeks. </p>

<p>Those in the 20-29 age group still have the highest infection rate of anyone in the country but the number of cases per 100,000 people dropped in the second week of September.</p>

<p>It fell from 55.9 per 100,000 to 51.8 between September 6 and September 13, according to PHE's most recent surveillance report. </p>

<p>Yvonne Doyle, a PHE medical director, told The Times: 'We're seeing clear signs this virus is now spreading widely across all age groups and I am particularly worried by the increase in rates of admission to hospital and intensive care among older people.'</p>

<p>Speaking today, Professor Neil Ferguson said 97 per cent of children getting a test receive a negative result </p>

<p>Speaking about a recent surge in testing demand on BBC Radio 4 this morning, Professor Neil Ferguson played down potential infections in schools.</p>

<p>He said: 'It was completely unanticipated by anyone that, what happened when the schools reopened was not necessarily a surge in Covid infections, but parents and teachers getting concerned about students coughing and spluttering, most of which was not Covid.</p>

<p>'We saw a huge surge in testing of children, most of whom, 97% of whom, tested negative. That surge in demand was not anticipated.'</p>
