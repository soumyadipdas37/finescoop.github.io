<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Brentford's new 17,250-capacity stadium in west London welcomed its first competitive game for the Bees Carabao Cup first round tie against Wycombe Wanderers.</p>

<p>The club left Griffin Park after 116 years at their iconic ground, which was famous for a pub on each corner and was the only stadium in the top two divisions to allow safe standing supporters.</p>

<p>But the west Londoners moved into their new state-of-the-art home in August next to the River Thames in Kew Bridge and the cup clash against the Chairboys is the first chance for Thomas Frank's side to test the ground at a competitive level.</p>

<p>Brentford's new ground opened its doors for a competitive match for the first time on Saturday</p>

<p>The Brentford Community Stadium located in Kew Bridge, west London holds 17,250 people </p>

<p>Speaking about the stadium move, Frank said: 'It's a massive boost. It's the same feeling as to when you move into a new house. </p>

<p>'You miss your old house because there are loads of new memories but you have to move on because you have this state of the art stadium. We're buzzing for it.'  </p>

<p>The Brentford Community Stadium is located half-way between Heathrow Airport and London's West End and is just a few minutes' walk from Kew Bridge rail station. </p>

<p>The Bees host Wycombe Wanderers in round one of the Carabao Cup on Saturday afternoon</p>

<p>The seats in the new ground are different colours so the ground always looks full</p>

<p>The seats in the 17,250-seater ground, which will also be used by London Irish rugby team, are different colours so that it always looks full no matter what the attendance is.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately for Brentford, at least the first two few in the new ground will be played behind-closed-doors due to coronavirus safety concerns. </p>

<p>After the Carabao Cup clash against Wycombe, the Bees host Huddersfield in their first home league game of the season. </p>

<p>The Bees will play the first games of their new ground behind closed doors due to COVID-19</p>

<p>The Government could allow reduced capacity attendances from the beginning of October, meaning their clash against Preston North End on October 3 could see fans see their new home for the first time on a matchday. </p>

<p>It is an exciting time for the west London club, who were so close to Premier League promotion last term and will be one of favourites to seal top-flight football this season. </p>

<p>The Bees reached the Championship play-off final after a third-placed finish in the second tier but lost out to west London rivals to Fulham in August. </p>
