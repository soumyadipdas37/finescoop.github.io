<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gogglebox star Jad Nehmetallah is believed to be one of Channel 10's 'top picks' for the upcoming season of The Bachelor.</p>

<p>And it seems everyone in the TV industry has heard about the rumours, with the exception of perhaps one person: 2019 Bachelorette Angie Kent.</p>

<p>Despite spending two years as co-stars on Gogglebox, Angie appeared to have no idea who Jad was when asked about the gossip in Sydney earlier this month.  </p>

<p>'Who's Jad?' Former Gogglebox star Angie Kent (L) appeared to have a mind blank when she is asked for her thoughts on co-star becoming the next Bachelor. Pictured with Yvie Jones (R)</p>

<p>A photographer asked Angie, 30, if she thought Jad would be a good Bachelor, and she replied: 'Who's Jad?'</p>

<p>'Jad from Gogglebox,' the snapper added, to which she responded: 'I have no idea who you are talking about.'</p>

<p>It wasn't until one of her male companions prompted her that Angie said: 'Oh, right... Yeah... I actually... yeah he would be good.'</p>

<p>Ouch!  In exclusive footage obtained by Daily Mail Australia, Angie, 30, replied: 'Who's Jad?' when asked if she thinks Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah would make a good Bachelor</p>

<p>It's possible Angie and Jad never physically met when they were on Gogglebox together because the households film their segments at their own homes and don't record as a group.</p>

<p>However, they almost certainly would have known of each other.</p>

<p>It comes just days after Jad addressed recent speculation he was being considered for next year's Bachelor. </p>

<p>No clue! In an attempt to help trigger her memory, the photographer replied: 'Jad from Gogglebox,' to which she replied: 'I have no idea who you are talking about'</p>

<p>Speaking to Lifestyle, the 34-year-old said: 'It's insane how many people online and in person have been mentioning it.'</p>

<p>'I am interested in finding love and starting a family but I'm having way too much fun with Matty and Sarah Marie [Fahd] on the couch to do anything else,' he added.</p>

<p>'And Malik's not ready to take over my seat just yet, so I'll be holding onto it for as long as I can!' </p>

<p>Setting the record straight: Gogglebox's Jad Nehmetallah recently addressed rumours he is being considered as a candidate for next year's season of Channel 10's The Bachelor </p>

<p>'I've been busy working hard and spending my time working with charities, supporting businesses during COVID,' he continued. </p>

<p>Jad previously told the website he had imagined his life at 34 would be different.</p>

<p>'I always pictured myself married by now with two to three kids,' he said at the time. </p>
