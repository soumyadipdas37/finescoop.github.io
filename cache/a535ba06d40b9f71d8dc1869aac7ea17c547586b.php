<p>Captioning the selfie, Yazmin penned: 'Take me back' as she recalled her recent getaway. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, it is said that Yazmin is set to appear on an upcoming episode of Celebrity Dinner Dates.</p>

<p>The beauty will choose three blind dates to go on, where her dates will attempt to wow her with their culinary skills. </p>

<p>A source told MailOnline that talk during one of dinner dates gets a little intimate as Yazmin suggests that her date should 'have a circumcision'.</p>

<p>The scenes were likely filmed before her recent reconciliation with co-star beau James, 33. </p>

<p>The on-again couple recently packed on the PDA during a holiday to Crete after they rekindled their romance earlier in the summer following an acrimonious break-up in 2019.</p>

<p>Last month they confirmed they were back on while shooting scenes for the new series of TOWIE in South Woodford, east London.</p>

<p>A week earlier, they were seen putting on a cosy display during filming for their show, hugging and giggling as they attended a food festival in Chelmsford, Essex.</p>

<p>While days before that, Yazmin and James did little to dispel rumours they had rekindled their relationship as they enjoyed dinner together at Sexy Fish in London's Mayfair. </p>

<p>Holiday bliss: The pair reconnetced during a romantic getaway to Greece last month</p>

<p>Soon after lockdown travel restrictions were lifted in June, Yazmin and James, who were together for two years, were seen kissing at a beach club in Mallorca.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun at the time: 'They're not officially back together but they're getting closer and everyone around them wouldn't be surprised if they got back together.</p>

<p>'They're getting along really well and sparks are flying – it's like the old days. They're on holiday with a large group of people but they're really reconnecting.'</p>

<p>Happy again: The pair looked more loved up than ever as they filmed new TOWIE scenes last month</p>
