<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian woman has shared the incredible bathroom ensuite makeover her 'handyman hubby' completed in 10 weeks - earning praise for its resort-style features.</p>

<p>The lady, who lives in New South Wales, revealed pictures of what her master ensuite looked like before and after the renovation on Facebook; exchanging the retro red tiles for a luxury grey and black matte finish. </p>

<p>'From ugly to glam! My ensuite has finally been finished today. My hubby who is normally a plumber is now also a tiler and an electrician. So happy with the transformation,' she wrote.</p>

<p>BEFORE: The ensuite had a small shower, a matching red vanity with two sinks, large mirror and a window that faced the side of their house</p>

<p>AFTER: During the 10-week blitz, her partner fitted a bath, timber vanity and basin bought from Homegear in Sydney, before installing two curved mirrors and shower glass from Highgrove Bathrooms</p>

<p>The ensuite had a small shower, a matching red vanity with two sinks, large mirror and a window that looked directly out on the side of their house.</p>

<p>'I found my husband at the pub one night and decided he looked handy and married him,' she joked about the tradesman behind the overhaul.</p>

<p>'Tiles are sourced from a local tile shop and made here in Newcastle called Travatine Grey Matt and Gascogne Black Matt,' she said.</p>

<p>Decorative light pendents were secured from eBay and hung over the bath with a smaller window created to let light seep into the room.  </p>

<p>'All of the gold tapware is from Eagles Plumbing,' she continued.</p>

<p>She was initially worried the gold wouldn't 'work' with the other elements in the bathroom but she's happy with the outcome.</p>

<p>Many of the comments beneath the post praised the high standard of work, and her ability to find such a 'good man' at the local pub.</p>

<p>'Looks great. Also how lucky were you to find a good catch at the pub, I struggle to win the raffles,' one woman said</p>
