<p>Celina, 23, spent two years at The Liberty Stadium but has been sacrificed by manager Steve Cooper because of financial restrictions at the Championship club.</p>

<p>The skilful forward, who can operate at No10 or wide, played for Kosovo in their Nations League defeat against Greece on Sunday before negotiating a four-year deal with Dijon who have lost both their league games this season.</p>

<p>Swansea have agreed to sell Kosovo international Bersant Celina to French Ligue 1 club Dijon</p>

<p>Celina played four times for City and spent a loan spell in Holland with FC Twente before joining Swansea.</p>

<p>He became a firm favourite in south Wales and scored against City in their 2019 FA Cup run to the quarter-finals.</p>

<p>However, his fortunes dipped after Cooper replaced Graham Potter as manager and a deal was seen in the best interests of all parties.</p>
