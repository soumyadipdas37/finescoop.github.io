<p>Saucy! Married At First Sight star Elizabeth Sobinoff decided to treat fans on Wednesday - with a seemingly nude photo of her boyfriend Seb Guilhaus (pictured)</p>

<p>The image in question saw Seb flaunting his rippling muscles and sun-kissed glow - with the seductive photo cutting off just at his private area.</p>

<p>In an attempt to dispel rumours he was nude, Lizzie added: 'And yes, he has pants on!'</p>

<p>Fans in their masses were quick to comment on the saucy snap, with one writing: 'Oh how devastating for you, it must be difficult handing a body like this every day!'</p>

<p>So in love! Elizabeth (left) often shares loved-up selfies with her hunky other half, after meeting him during her second stint on Married At First Sight  </p>

<p>'Oh dear Lord,' another simply wrote, while a third gushed: 'Put it away Seb!'</p>

<p>A fourth fan laughed: 'And this is why I love you - thank you for sharing!'</p>

<p>Elizabeth and Seb met while starring on her second season of Married At First Sight in 2020.</p>

<p>The pair were recently forced to spend three months apart due to the coronavirus pandemic, after she returned to Sydney for work while he stayed in Adelaide.</p>

<p>Support: Lizzie was inundated with messages from fans - who absolutely loved looking at the steamy image</p>

<p>She said they ultimately stayed connected through 'constant texting' while apart, and finally reunited in June.</p>

<p>Last month, Elizabeth spoke about living with her boyfriend of seven months while appearing on the podcast, Fashion Avenue.</p>

<p>'I mean, it's just normal to get frustrated with everyone,' she said, before adding that she was 'loving' being with Seb in Sydney.</p>

<p>She continued: 'I'm actually in such a great place in my life at the moment. He's just amazing! And it's that bonding.'</p>

<p>Happy couple: Since meeting on the popular dating show, Elizabeth and Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are living as a couple </p>
