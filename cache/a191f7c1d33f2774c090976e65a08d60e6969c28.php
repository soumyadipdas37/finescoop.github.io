<p> The three women, social media influencers Eden Estrada (center), Joslyn Allen (right) and Jaslene Busanet (left), have spoken out about their experience and called for justice</p>

<p>According to a press release released by the L.A. County District Attorney, Callaway allegedly befriended the three victims in the early hours of August 17 and offered to buy them items from a store off Hollywood Boulevard. </p>

<p>After they left, he then 'approached one of the victims with a metal bar and demanded her shoes and bracelet'.  He is then accused of attacking a second victim with a bottle. Police say he made derogatory remarks during the incident. </p>

<p>William is accused of then joining in on the attack by throwing a scooter at one of the women. </p>

<p>Deputy District Attorney Richard Ceballos of the Hate Crimes Unit has been assigned to the case as prosecutor.</p>

<p>The hate crime charges have been praised by LGBT activists. </p>

<p>Terra Russell-Slavin, policy director for the the Los Angeles LGBT Center, told NBC on Tuesday: 'I think we're really encouraged to see that the prosecutors moved forward with both filing charges and ensuring the charges had a hate crime enhancement. Hate crimes are really an attack on the whole community." </p>

<p>After the attacks, LAPD chief Michael Moore pledged to protect and support  the trans community. </p>

<p>'I want to express to the entire transgender community that these kind of instances with hate and violence have no place in Los Angeles,' he stated.  </p>

<p>'The LAPD stands fully in support of your rights, your dignity and respect to each of you as individuals. We will not allow this to occur here.' </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Los Angeles police deputy chief Justin Eisenberg slammed onlookers who were seen in videos of the attack watching on, rather than helping the women.  </p>

<p>The three victims say the crowd urged their attackers on, even shouting transphobic slurs and throwing rocks at them as the violent scene unfolded.  </p>

<p>'What was particularly callous about these crimes was the actions of the onlookers,' Eisenberg stated several days after the incident, describing the witnesses as 'callous'.   </p>

<p>After the incident, Eden (left) posted a series of clips to her Instagram story, said to have been captured by Instagram user <?php echo e('@'); ?>stevofilms, who broadcast the attack live, and posted it to his page. Busanet (right), meanwhile, said she feared for her life when she was hit</p>

<p>Following the attack, more than 150 people turned out at a march in support of trans lives. </p>

<p>'I want to say a heartfelt thank you from the bottom of my heart for all the love and support we have received in the past 3 days. When this event happened, all I could think about was how grateful I am to be alive,' she wrote. </p>

<p>'I never knew that this would be seen by millions of people. </p>

<p>'It has really uplifted me in the darkest time of my life. Without all of your help, and the help of the LAPD, we would have never been able to make this amount of progress this fast. </p>

<p>'Trans lives matter. I don't care who you are or where you come from but you matter.'  </p>

<p>Since the attack, protests have taken place to support the women and a GoFundMe has been established to assist with their legal fees. </p>

<p>It has raised more than $45,000.   </p>

<p>A GoFundMe page for the three woman have raised more than $37,000 by Friday night</p>

<p>The attack comes amid rising concerns from LGBTQ right advocates who have accused US law enforcement of not doing enough when it comes to crimes involving transgender victims.</p>

<p>So far this year, at least 26 transgender or non-conforming individuals have been killed, with women of color deemed the most vulnerable group.</p>

<p>The Human Rights Campaign, reported 25 killings in 2019 and 29 in 2018, the most it had recorded in a year.  </p>
