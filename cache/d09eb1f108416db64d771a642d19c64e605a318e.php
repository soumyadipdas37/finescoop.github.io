<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>No more ex-soldiers will be taken to court over the 1972 Bloody Sunday shootings, Northern Ireland prosecutors announced today.</p>

<p>The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) confirmed last year that one veteran, known as Soldier F, would face charges over their actions in Londonderry on January 30, when 13 civilians were fatally shot.  </p>

<p>A further 15 civilians were wounded when soldiers from the Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators, in an incident which became known as Bloody Sunday.</p>

<p>Families of some of the victims requested a review of the PPS decision in March 2019. They have expressed disappointment at today's outcome, and have vowed to fight on for justice by pursuing a judicial review at the High Court in Belfast.</p>

<p>The PPS today announced that the original decision not to prosecute 15 veterans reported in connection with the events of Bloody Sunday has been upheld.</p>

<p>The reviews were undertaken by PPS senior assistant director Marianne O'Kane, who was not previously involved in the cases.</p>

<p>In a statement, the PPS said Ms O'Kane concluded that the Test for Prosecution is not met on evidential grounds to prosecute any of the 15 soldiers in connection with the specific deaths or injuries sustained on January 30, 1972.</p>

<p>'In March 2019, the PPS engaged extensively with the families of those killed and injured on Bloody Sunday to explain the reasons why the original decision-maker concluded that the available evidence did not meet the Test for Prosecution for all but one suspect reported,' Ms O'Kane said.</p>

<p>'Given the importance of these decisions to all affected by them, and the extensive public interest in the events of Bloody Sunday, the deep disappointment felt by many families at that time was wholly understandable.</p>

<p>'This was despite assurances received from the PPS that its decision-making had been conducted in an independent, fair and impartial manner.</p>

<p>'It was therefore also understandable that a number of the bereaved families and injured victims subsequently exercised their right to request a review of decisions relating to 15 of those suspects originally reported.</p>

<p>'The reviews process began substantively in November 2019, after receipt of all legal submissions, and involved applying the Test for Prosecution afresh to all available evidence submitted by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) from 2016-17.</p>

<p>Lying on the ground is a man receiving attention, during the shooting incident in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, which became known as Bloody Sunday on January 30, 1972</p>

<p>'I have concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction of any of the 15 soldiers who were the subjects of the reviews.</p>

<p>'Accordingly, the decisions not to prosecute these 15 individuals all stand.'</p>

<p>Ms O'Kane added: 'I know that today's outcome will cause further upset to those who have pursued a long and determined journey for justice over almost five decades.</p>

<p>'I can only offer reassurance to all of the families and victims of Bloody Sunday, and the wider community, that my decisions were conducted wholly independently and impartially, and in accordance with the Code for Prosecutors.'</p>

<p>Soldier F has been charged with the murder of James Wray and William McKinney.</p>

<p>He is also accused of the attempted murders of Patrick O'Donnell, Joseph Friel, Joe Mahon and Michael Quinn. </p>

<p>He faces a seventh supporting charge of the attempted murder of a person or persons unknown on the day.</p>

<p>Ms O'Kane said there will be no change to those charges.</p>

<p>'The prosecution that commenced against him in 2019, which relates to two charges of murder and five charges of attempted murder, continues,' she said.</p>

<p>Around 15 civilians were wounded when soldiers from the Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators, in an incident which became known as Bloody Sunday </p>

<p>John Kelly (pictured), whose brother Michael was killed, said today: 'We're not giving up yet, we have now the next stage, the judicial review at the High Court'</p>

<p>The families of some of those killed on Bloody Sunday today vowed to fight on for justice following the PPS decision. </p>

<p>John Kelly, whose brother Michael was killed, said: 'We're not giving up yet, we have now the next stage, the judicial review at the High Court.</p>

<p>'It's been a long road, up to nearly 50 years, we're all getting old, a lot of people are dying but as long as we're able to walk, we'll go after them and we certainly will not stop until we see justice for our loved ones.</p>

<p>Here is a timeline of events in the years before and after the Good Friday Agreement.</p>

<p>1988 </p>

<p>Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams and his main nationalist rival, SDLP leader John Hume, begin secret peace talks </p>

<p>1991</p>

<p>Martin McGuinness, a senior figure in the IRA, starts secret peace talks with MI6 </p>

<p>1993 </p>

<p>October - Irish Taoiseach Albert Reynolds UK Prime Minister John Major produce the Downing Street declaration setting out their peace vision </p>

<p>1994</p>

<p>August 31 - The IRA announced a ceasefire with loyalist paramilitaries following suit. </p>

<p>1995</p>

<p>May 10 - First official meeting in 23 years between Sinn Fein and a British Government minister. </p>

<p>1997</p>

<p>May - Tony Blair gives a speech in Belfast, warning republicans: 'The settlement train is leaving. I want you on that train.'</p>

<p>July 20 - The IRA reinstates its ceasefire to enable Sinn Fein to take part in talks </p>

<p>1998</p>

<p>April 10 - The Good Friday Agreement is signed and is endorsed a month later in a referendum</p>

<p>2007</p>

<p>Sinn Fein endorses the police in Northern Ireland, and elections for Stormont are held </p>

<p>May 8 - The DUP's Rev Ian Paisley becomes First Minister and Sin Fein's Martin McGuinness is appointed Deputy First Minister</p>

<p>The pair's surprisingly warm relationship leads to them being referred to as the Chuckle Brothers. </p>

<p>2010</p>

<p>The Saville Report exonerates the civilians who were killed on Bloody Sunday leading to a formal apology from then Prime Minister David Cameron to the families. </p>

<p>2019</p>

<p>Prosecutors announce whether to brig charges against the 17 surviving Paras who fired shots that day. If found guilty the former soldiers, the oldest of whom is 77, could face life jail terms.</p>

<p>'Every one of them should face the wrath of the law.'</p>

<p>He added: 'Over the years we've had many kicks in the teeth, but I think most of us have still got full sets of teeth and we're not giving up, we're never giving up on it.'</p>

<p>Mickey McKinney's brother Willie was also shot dead on Bloody Sunday.</p>

<p>Soldier F has been charged with his murder.</p>

<p>He said he is 'bitterly disappointed' for the other families.</p>

<p>'I'm concerned that the passage of time is very important to us in this case. I think time is in favour of the soldiers,' he said.</p>

<p>Foyle MP Colum Eastwood (SDLP) paid tribute to the families as having shown 'the most unshakeable dignity and integrity in moments of justice as well as moments of disappointment'.</p>

<p>'Today's decision will not change that,' he said.</p>

<p>'I am pledged to do all I can to support these families who mean so much to Derry. We'll continue to walk with them.'</p>

<p>However, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell (DUP) questioned potential further costs.</p>

<p>'The issue now will be, is there now going to be a judicial review which is going to entail further cost - remember there's already been almost £200 million spent on the public inquiry, the most expensive in legal history in the UK,' he told the BBC.</p>

<p>'I think more and more people will be saying how much further is this going to go on, because there are families today across Northern Ireland who are still grieving? There are families of two police officers who were murdered in the area where the Bloody Sunday events happened, just three days before. </p>

<p>'They have never received justice, never received a public inquiry and never received any independent review into the circumstances surrounding the murders of their loved ones.'</p>

<p>Solicitor Ciaran Shiels described the decision to bring no further prosecutions as 'deeply disappointing for these families and wounded'.</p>

<p>'The families are left with no alternative now but to consider judicial review proceedings in the High Court in Belfast,' he said. </p>

<p>The circumstances of Bloody Sunday were investigated in the Saville Inquiry, the longest and most expensive public inquiry in British legal history.</p>

<p>It looked into the events surrounding the massacre in Londonderry in which 13 people were shot dead when members of the Parachute Regiment opened fire on civilians on January 30, 1972.</p>

<p>The shooting became one of the most infamous incidents in the history of The Troubles, with allegations that IRA instigators were among the crowd and that British gunfire was provoked.</p>

<p>Troops fired more than 100 bullets into the crowd, killing 13, and injuring 15. </p>

<p>One of the injured died five months later, but the Saville Inquiry concluded he did not died as a result of wounds he sustained on Bloody Sunday. </p>

<p>The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation in 2010 after the Saville Report said those who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent.</p>

<p>Eighteen former paratroopers were initially reported to Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service over the killings, one of whom died in 2018.  </p>

<p>Bloody Sunday, which took place at the height of Northern Ireland's 30-year sectarian conflict, was the worst single shooting incident of 'The Troubles', although several bomb attacks by rival militant groups claimed higher death tolls.</p>

<p>Thirteen unarmed civilians were shot dead by the 1st Battalion of the British Army's Parachute Regiment on what became known as Bloody Sunday in Bogside, Londonderry on January 30, 1972.</p>

<p>Another 15 people were wounded in the shootings, with one of those injured - John Johnston - dying four months later. </p>

<p>Other protesters were injured by shrapnel or batons, and two were run down by army vehicles during the chaos which broke out on William Street.  </p>

<p>The killings, which took place in the space of ten minutes shortly after 4pm, happened during a protest against internment without trial organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA). </p>

<p>The parade, which involved an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 people, had set off from Bishop's Field in the Creggan area of Londonderry, with plans to end at the Guildhall.</p>

<p>But when the march reached the city centre, those in charge decided to avoid Guildhall and instead walk to Free Derry Corner in Bogside as the route had been blocked by British Army barriers.</p>

<p>However, several demonstrators diverted from the main group at Rossville Street and continued to where a barricade had been erected on William Street to prevent approaches to Guildhall.  </p>

<p>Those involved began throwing stones towards the soldiers at around 3.40pm, and the Regiment responded by firing plastic bullets, CS gas and spraying demonstrators with water cannons.</p>

<p>In the Saville Inquiry, which investigated the circumstances of Bloody Sunday, Lord Saville said soldiers from the Royal Green Jackets 'acted with restraint in the face of the rioting at this barrier and deployed no more than properly proportionate force in seeking to deal with it'. </p>

<p>At around 3.55pm it is understood the crowd spotted paratroopers occupying a derelict three-story building overlooking William Street, and began throwing stones at the windows. </p>

<p>These soldiers then opened fire, with Damien Donaghy and John Johnston shot and wounded while standing on waste ground opposite the building.    </p>

<p>Colonel Derek Wilford, commanding the Regiment, sent a message to Brigade Headquarters from his position near a church suggesting troops be sent through the barrier to arrest rioters.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, at 4.07pm, Brigadier Pat MacLellan gave orders for the Regiment to mount an arrest operation at William Street - known as Barrier 14 - but not to 'chase people down the street.'</p>

<p>Colonel Wilford deployed one company through Barrier 14 as permitted, but also deployed a support company in vehicles from the nearby Barrier 12 on Little James Street.</p>

<p>Those from Barrier 12 travelled into Bogside and disembarked, which is when more rifle shots were fired.</p>

<p>Soldiers opened fire in the car park of the Rossville Flats, shooting teenager Jackie Duddy, 17, in the back as he ran with Father Edward Daly and wounding several others. </p>

<p>Six others were shot on Rossville Street, as other soldiers entered Glenfada Park North, where William McKinney, 26, and Jim Wray, 22, were fatally wounded.</p>

<p>Those in Glenfada Park North then went to its south-east entrance, from where they fired across to Rossville Street and killed Bernard McGuigan, 41, and fatally injured Patrick Doherty, 31.</p>

<p>Nearby, in Abbey Park, a British Army solider shot Gerard McKinney, 35. The shot passed through his body and hit Gerald Donaghey, 17.</p>

<p>In total, 26 unarmed civilians were shot by paratroopers during Bloody Sunday. Thirteen died on the day and another died of his injuries four months later.</p>

<p>At an inquest into the deaths, held in August 1973, coroner Hubert O'Neill, a retired British Army major, said: 'This Sunday became known as Bloody Sunday and bloody it was. It was quite unnecessary. </p>

<p>'It strikes me that the Army ran amok that day and shot without thinking what they were doing. They were shooting innocent people. </p>

<p>'These people may have been taking part in a march that was banned but that does not justify the troops coming in and firing live rounds indiscriminately. </p>

<p>'I would say without hesitation that it was sheer, unadulterated murder. It was murder.'</p>
