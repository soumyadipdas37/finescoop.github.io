<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>BBC sports legend Sue Barker is set to stay on as the Corporation’s face of Wimbledon, despite being removed as host of A Question Of Sport.</p>

<p>The former French Open champion learned last week that she would no longer be fronting the quiz show institution after 24 years in the job.</p>

<p>However, she will minimally be presenting for the next two summers at Wimbledon where she has been a permanent fixture for even longer, having worked at every Championships since 1993, including this year’s daily package of nostalgia.</p>

<p>Sue Barker found out she was removed from A Question of Sport after 24 years in the job</p>

<p>She will however carry on in her role presenting at Wimbledon where she become a staple</p>

<p>Sportsmail understands she signed a new three-year contract last year to carry her through until at least 2022, something that will come as a relief to many viewers. Barker has not only fronted the TV coverage, but carried out interviews on Centre Court following some of the most watched events in British sport of recent decades, such as Andy Murray’s first win in 2013.</p>

<p>She will also continue to be in the chair for the ATP Finals at the O2 Arena in November and the Fever Tree Championships at Queen’s Club, which are also part of her deal.</p>

<p>Team captains Phil Tufnell and Matt Dawson have also been shown the door at A Question of Sport, in its latest revamp having run since 1970. Sources disclosed to Sportsmail that Alex Scott, the former Arsenal and England defender, is well-liked by the broadcaster and in the mix to replace Barker as presenter. </p>

<p>Jermaine Jenas and Alex Scott have both been tipped to join A Question of Sport in the future</p>

<p>Ex-Tottenham and England midfielder Jermaine Jenas is also in the running to become one of the new team captains, with the BBC keen to diversify.</p>

<p>Barker, Tufnell and Dawson all accepted the BBC’s decision with good grace.</p>

<p>‘It’s been my dream job,’ said Barker. ‘But I understand the BBC want to take the show in a new direction and I’m sad to say goodbye.’</p>

<p>A BBC spokesperson said: ‘We would like to thank Sue for her enormous contribution as the show’s longest reigning host over the last 24 years, and Matt and Phil for their excellent team captaincy over 16 and 12 years respectively.’ </p>
