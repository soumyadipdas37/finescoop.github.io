<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Neal Maupay chipped a cheeky Panenka penalty high into David de Gea’s net with the Manchester United goalkeeper sprawled on the floor. Then the Frenchman wheeled away towards the empty stands at the Amex, screwed up his fists and held them to his eyes as if to cry.</p>

<p>Boohoo. Maupay hadn’t only embarrassed De Gea, who kicked the ball at him in anger, he now seemed to be mocking Brighton’s opponents after putting them in front just before half-time.</p>

<p>Little more than an hour later, at the climax of a frantic and frankly quite barmy game, the Frenchman stood in roughly the same spot and this time the tears welling in his eyes were genuine.</p>

<p>Neal Maupay had endured a rollercoaster afternoon after scoring and giving away a penalty</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted Manchester United were fortunate to beat a dominant Brighton</p>

<p>Maupay couldn’t believe what he had just done: raised his arm to deflect Harry Maguire’s header inside his own box.</p>

<p>What followed almost beggared belief. The final whistle, the protestations from both teams, the dramatic VAR check pitchside and, finally, Bruno Fernandes scoring from the spot himself to make it 3-2.</p>

<p>Maupay’s face was a picture and one that summed up Brighton’s heartbreak. They deserved to win never mind draw. Five times they hit the woodwork – with Leandro Trossard getting an unwanted hat-trick of striking both posts and the bar – and had another penalty award overturned for Paul Pogba’s clumsy challenge on Aaron Connolly.</p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes stepped up in stoppage time to fire home a spot kick after Maupay's handball</p>

<p>Maupay was penalised after full-time for using his arm to stop Harry Maguire's glancing header</p>

<p>Yes, United had two goals disallowed but for the second week in a row they had been outplayed by a team likely to finish in the bottom half of the Premier League table.</p>

<p>For Crystal Palace read Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Only the result was different. Having lost 3-1 to Palace, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer admitted that his team ‘got away with one’ on this occasion and he was right.</p>

<p>Thankfully for the manager he will be spared another week of criticism and inquests, but the truth is an undercooked United were every bit as sluggish again.</p>

<p>They got out of jail thanks to a flash of inspiration from Marcus Rashford and Maguire’s presence in the Brighton box that led to the other two goals. Most of all, though, they got lucky.</p>

<p>Marcus Rashford scored a superb solo effort after racing forwards and finding the top corner</p>

<p>‘I don’t think we’ve ever scored after the final whistle,’ said Solskjaer, a veteran of countless United wins in Fergie Time. ‘But we’ve discussed it this season and we need more late goals.</p>

<p>‘When they equalised that is two points lost – or maybe one point was what we deserved, we didn't deserve more.</p>

<p>‘We’ve got to be honest enough to say Brighton created the most chances. They had a lot of shots and big chances. We need to improve a lot in the weeks going forward.</p>

<p>‘We know we’re not at our peak with sharpness and fitness because of the long season we had in Europe and the late pre-season. We had prepared for that but you could see towards the end they had more steam than us. We had enough in the tank to create a reaction to their equaliser.</p>

<p>‘We’ve got three or four weeks catching up to do to a few teams. The more games we play and the more 90 minutes the lads get we’ll be better and sharper.</p>

<p>Solskjaer (L) will rightly be concerned after his team were sluggish and undercooked yet again</p>

<p>‘The spirit and the character of the boys I don’t question at all because I see them every day. The sharpness and fitness might not be there and the form, but it’s going to come.’</p>

<p>Brighton manager Graham Potter had every reason to look bereft. His team were outstanding. Once the shellshock of this result wears off, they will wonder long and hard just how it happened.</p>

<p>Potter, to his credit, did not complain other than to question whether United should have been given time to snatch a winner after Solly March had headed Brighton level at 2-2 in the fifth and final minute of added time.</p>

<p>It was the 100th minute when Fernandes stepped up to add the final, dramatic twist.</p>

<p>‘I thought we scored with the last kick of the game – I don’t know where the extra time came from,’ said Potter.</p>

<p>Graham Potter questioned whether United should have been given time to score their winner</p>

<p>‘We are bitterly disappointed to concede in the way and time we have. It was a cruel blow after a fantastic performance.</p>

<p>‘I spoke to the group and said I was sorry I couldn’t make them feel any better apart from saying how well they all played. I thought the performance was amazing, as well as I’ve seen us play.</p>

<p>‘At the moment it’s very sore because we haven’t taken anything from the game. To not come away from anything seems a bit cruel. </p>

<p>‘It’s a shame that there aren’t supporters here to see a wonderful game, but I’m sure they would have felt as sick as us at the end. That’s how brutal this league is.’</p>
