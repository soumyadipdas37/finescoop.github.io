<p>Manchester United have reportedly made a breakthrough over agents fees and personal terms as they look to sign Jadon Sancho</p>

<p>Dortmund value Sancho at £108million, but United have so far been unwilling to pay that figure, despite their desire to sign the England international.</p>

<p>United were in negotiations for Sancho but talks broke down.</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side still need to agree a few with Dortmund if they are to sign Sancho</p>

<p>England international Sancho is eager to secure a move to United before the window closes</p>

<p>A deadline of August 10 was set by Dortmund to finalise a deal, but, after a move failed to materialise, Sancho went on to play for the German club in pre-season.</p>

<p>United know that Sancho, who has 30 goals and 38 assists in 78 Bundesliga appearances, could add an extra edge to their team if he joined.</p>

<p>So far in this transfer window, United have made one major signing, bringing in midfielder Donny van de Beek from Ajax. </p>
