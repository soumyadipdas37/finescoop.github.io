<p>Boogie, meaning to dance and disco meaning a party where people dance to music where also terms deemed outdated by younger millennials and Generation Z.</p>

<p>Evie Porter, from Perspectus Global who commissioned the research said, 'Our research shows that many words are simply losing favour, with millennials having no idea of their meaning.'</p>

<p>In 2018, writer Edward Allhusen released a book with a list of 600 endangered words in which included trollop, to describe a disreputable woman and nincopoop, meaning simpleton, which also made Perspectus' list of words not known by young adults.  </p>

<p>Young people believe that the word 'bonk' to describe having sex is outdated, while betrothed, meaning engaged is also not in millenial's vocabulary</p>

<p>As well as listing endangered words, Mr Allhusen has also highlighted how the meaning of words has evolved over the past two and a half centuries.</p>

<p>He studied the seminal 1755 book by Samuel Johnson, 'A Dictionary of the English Language' to see which words have survived to this day and how their meanings have changed.</p>

<p>In that edition, he was intrigued to find the term 'betrump', which was defined as to deceive, to cheat or to evade by guile.</p>

<p>The meaning of other words have changed completely - now associated with cricket, the word 'innings' once meant land reclaimed from the sea.</p>

<p>Also listed was tosh, meaning nonsense; henceforth, meaning from this time on; lush, meaning very good; minted meaning rich (stock image shows a piggy bank) and kerfuffle, which describes a fuss or commotions</p>

<p>The new list also includes words betrothed, meaning engaged, and bonk, meaning to have sex.</p>

<p>Also listed was tosh, meaning nonsense; henceforth, meaning from this time on; lush, meaning very good; minted meaning rich and kerfuffle, which describes a fuss or commotions.</p>

<p>Across all age groups, 40 percent believe it is right for some words to be consigned to history, if they are insulting or old fashioned.</p>

<p>And more than a third agreed that many words are simply not relevant today, with a quarter saying the English language is constantly evolving which is a good thing. </p>

<p>But a third of those over 50 thought it was sad that language is dying out.</p>
