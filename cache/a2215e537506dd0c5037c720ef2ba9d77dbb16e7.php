<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Perugia Airport has retracted its claim Boris Johnson flew into Italy earlier this month - and said staff had him muddled with Tony Blair.</p>

<p>The president of the airport set the record straight this afternoon hours after Downing Street first issued a robust denial of the story.  </p>

<p>An article published last night by La Repubblica carried a statement from the airport which said Mr Johnson had passed through 'in the last few days'.</p>

<p>It was accompanied by a quote from an airport source, saying he landed on Friday, September 11 at 2pm.</p>

<p>Number 10 rubbished the version of events as 'completely untrue' and insisted the Prime Minister had not travelled to Italy in recent months.</p>

<p>Perugia Airport's president has now told the Daily Telegraph Mr Johnson was 'definitely' not at the airport and staff mistook him for ex-Labour PM Mr Blair. </p>

<p>Perugia Airport has retracted its claim Boris Johnson flew into Italy earlier this month - and said staff had him muddled with Tony Blair </p>

<p>The president of the airport (pictured) set the record straight this afternoon hours after Downing Street first issued a robust denial of the story.</p>

<p>The withdrawal draws a line under a mystery that had Westminster puzzled.  </p>

<p>On the Friday he was claimed to be in Italy, Mr Johnson was faced with MPs preparing to rebel on his international law-breaking Brexit legislation and rising numbers of coronavirus infections across the UK. </p>

<p>The PM and fiancee Carrie Symonds also reportedly baptised son Wilfred that weekend, it was claimed last week. </p>

<p>Mr Johnson has reportedly travelled to the airport before to visit his friend Evgeny Lebedev, owner of the Evening Standard, at his medieval castle.</p>

<p>Russian-born Mr Lebedev, whose father is a former KGB operative, is known for hosting lavish parties for celebrity guests at the Castello di Santa Eurasia. </p>

<p>According to one report Mr Johnson worked from Downing Street on the day in question and took part in a Zoom call with 256 Tory MPs on Brexit.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson had tried to give a patriotic rallying cry to encourage his colleagues to back his controversial plans for the UK's withdrawal from the EU.</p>

<p>One source said that Mr Johnson's connection had cut out during the call and when he came back on he joked that he should probably invest in super-fast internet, Politics Home reported.</p>

<p>Lebedev, 41, who owns the Evening Standard newspaper and is frequently seen mixing in the upper echelons of the celebrity social scene, owns the breathtaking Castello di Santa Eurasia</p>

<p>Russian-born Mr Lebedev, whose father is a former KGB operative, is known for hosting lavish parties for his celebrity friends at the Castello di Santa Eurasia </p>

<p>Last year it was reported that Mr Johnson, during his time as Foreign Secretary, had been spotted at Perugia's airport looking dishevelled 'in last night's clothes.'</p>

<p>A fellow passenger told The Guardian that Mr Johnson appeared to be stumbling around and at one point looked as if he might vomit.</p>

<p>There was silence from Mr Johnson's communications staff when those reports emerged last year.</p>

<p>Last month, Mr Johnson nominated Mr Lebedev for a life peerage for his services to the media industry and his philanthropic work.</p>

<p>A Downing Street spokesperson had said: 'This story is completely untrue. The Prime Minister has not travelled to Italy in recent months. Anyone who publishes these claims is repeating a falsehood.' </p>
