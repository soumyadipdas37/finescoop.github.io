<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It’s the last tolerated prejudice. But Femail’s had enough. It’s time we called out those day-to-day moments when we’re patronised for no longer being young... </p>

<p>I'm pleased to read of the 63-year-old pharmacy employee who won £15,000 in compensation after being taunted at work by her fellow workers about her hearing loss.</p>

<p>If there is one thing that marks you out as being 'older' among younger people, it is being hard of hearing. I know this because over the past few years I have become a little deaf myself, something my children, bat-like in their ability to hear me on the telephone two floors down, are always drawing my attention to.</p>

<p>Christa D'Souza (pictured) explains why she finds that losing hearing sets you apart as being 'older' among the young</p>

<p>Deafness is more alienating than blindness when it comes to inter-generational socialising, I've come to believe. And I'll go to great lengths to hide it, including avoiding trendy restaurants which play music.</p>

<p>It's not just the music, though, it's also non-carpeted floors and groups of more than six.</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is to get a hearing aid — there are some super stealthy ones out there on the market that blend right in with one's hair.</p>

<p>But that feels, somehow, like giving in. I'm going to have to do something though.</p>

<p>It's wearing to participate in conversations I cannot actually hear.</p>
