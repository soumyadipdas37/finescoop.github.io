<p>Jonit Ragaisyte, 29, pleaded guilty to 12 charges including trespassing, stealing bank cards and dishonestly obtaining property in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday </p>

<p>Ragaisyte visited her rented storage unit at Port Melbourne Storage on Lorimer Street along with three unknown men at 1.50am on February 16 </p>

<p>CCTV footage caught the group going in and out of the storage space for two hours, the Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>Throughout the night they got into the office of a used car dealership at the same facility and allegedly stole credit cards and car keys, according to police.</p>

<p>The group left just after 4am in a car that was stolen from Joe Vella Used Cars. </p>

<p>Ragaisyte then used the stolen cards to purchase a phone, credit, cigarettes, a lighter and toiletries at Coles in Port Melbourne.</p>

<p>She then drove around St Kilda and used the cards on a shopping spree.</p>

<p>After that she got a room at the Aura Apartment on the seventh floor where detectives later found she had broken into another room while guests were out.</p>

<p>The hotel guests later came back to find their door still locked but a Nike backpack, clothing and toiletries were missing.</p>

<p>Police say the only way into the room would have been through the balcony.</p>

<p>Ragaisyte pleaded guilty to the high-rise hotel robbery in June 2019 and her co-accused was also charged but is yet to face court.</p>

<p>Magistrate Hayley Bate told Ragaisyte's lawyer in court that she had been 'assessed at a high risk of re-offending'.</p>

<p>Ragaisyte was handed a 12-month community corrections order and will have to complete 100 hours of community work.</p>

<p>She will also undergo ongoing drug, alcohol and mental health tests.</p>

<p>In September last year Ragaisyte avoided jail after she admitted to possessing meth, and was given only a two-year good behaviour bond.</p>

<p>She admitted possessing GHB-alternative butanediol as well as n-ethylhexedrone, a drug similar to methamphetamine. </p>

<p>Police found an 'Aladdin's cave' of drugs at the Docklands apartment the 27-year-old shared with her then-boyfriend Cemre Volkan in 2017. </p>

<p>The 27-year-old was also caught with meth she forgot was in her Chanel handbag while visiting her bodybuilder-turned-drug trafficker partner in prison. </p>
