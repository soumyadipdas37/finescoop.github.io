<p>What's more, experimental cooks can keep the clean-up to a minimum, regardless of how many ingredients have been used, thanks to the removable plates. These plates can also be swapped with the Breville VST079 Waffle Plates if you're looking for the perfect breakfast treat. </p>

<p>'Best sandwich toaster I've owned,' one reviewer raved. 'Nice and deep plates/groves to allow you to get some good amount of fillings in. </p>

<p>'It so much better than the shallow ones you get from other brands, this beats them by miles. The PRICE on this is well worth it, it is a bargain!'</p>

<p>While the toastie maker doesn't have some of the bells and whistles that others boast, the no-frills-no-fuss approach makes it quick and easy to use.</p>

<p>The Ultimate Deep Fill on the Breville Ultimate Deep Fill Toastie Maker can cater to your cravings, from sweet and savoury to classic and creative</p>

<p>One delighted shopper wrote: 'This has revived our love of the toasted sandwich! When our original Breville gave up the ghost after many years of service we started using toasting bags. </p>

<p>'Although quicker, they weren't as tasty and eventually toasted sandwiches were off the family menu. Reminiscing recently about our favourite toasted filling (ham, cheese and pineapple ring) we decided to purchase another sandwich maker. Brilliant!' </p>

<p>Another added: 'The Rolls Royce of toastie makers! Had lots of toastie makers over the years. This is by far the best one to date! Nice robust casing with stainless steel. Easy to clean and cooks toasties to perfection! Waffle plates can be purchased separately which I may have to invest in!'</p>
