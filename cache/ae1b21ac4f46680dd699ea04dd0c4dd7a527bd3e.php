<p>And Channing Tatum marked the moment with an eye-popping image on Instagram on Thursday, showcasing his super fit physique in a sexy mirror selfie.</p>

<p>Worked out bod: Channing Tatum marked the moment with an eye-popping image on Instagram on Thursday, showcasing his super fit physique in a sexy mirror selfie</p>

<p>'It's been a long road back,' the father-of-one wrote in the caption. </p>

<p>'Injuries, life sh*t, and just insanity in general. Ha daddy is finally back boooi!! Gonna be a fun next 10 year run. To all those that have been there for me and held me down through it all. I love you. I'm gonna make ya proud.</p>

<p>'Let's goo,' Tatum added. 'Also peep the purell bottle. Keep it clean out there folks. Hahaha'</p>

<p>Channing was referring to the hand sanitizer visible on the counter in front of the mirror, which sat not far from a face shield visible as well. </p>

<p>While it wasn't wholly clear what Channing was referring to when he wrote about being 'back,' it would seem to be a reference to his new role in the film Dog – a movie he is co-directing.</p>

<p>The movie, which the Magic Mike star is also co-writing and producing, will follow an army ranger who travels along the California coast with his dog on the way to a friend's funeral.</p>

<p>And even though Tatum has enjoyed featured roles in films such as 2017's Kingsman: The Golden Circle and Logan Lucky, it's been a solid five years since he headlined bigger hit Magic Mike XXL – and even bigger dud Jupiter Ascending.  </p>

<p>Working actor: Channing is at work on a new role in the film Dog – a movie he is co-directing, co-writing and producing; seen in January</p>

<p>Just this week, Tatum referred to his new film more directly in a previous Instagram post, which saw the actor on top of a vintage Ford with a cute dog looking at him from nearby.</p>

<p>'It’s already been a crazy ride,' Channing captioned the duo of shots. And we’ve only just begun. And if we survive the rest, it will be one of the most insane stories that I've ever been a part of. </p>

<p>'And I’ve been a part of some pretty crazy ones in this life of mine,' he continued.</p>

<p>'This photo is from our first day of production on the first movie that my partner Reid and I are directing. This is our story. It's taken us two years to get it to the starting line. The next eight weeks will be like riding a bull on sickmode in ludicrous speed.</p>

<p>'God be with us. In Dog we trust,' Tatum concluded, before adding '#DogMovie <?php echo e('@'); ?>dogthefilm'</p>

<p>Reid, who is a decorated producer with credits including Channing's hits Magic Mike XXL, 22 Jump Street and White House Down, is also working on another upcoming title with the Hollywood hunk – Wingmen, which will star Channing opposite actor and director Joseph Gordon-Levitt.</p>
