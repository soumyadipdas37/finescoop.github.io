<p>In an interview with KIIS FM's Kyle and Jackie O Show in August, Locky admitted to bedding his winning contestant on the night of the finale.    </p>

<p>At the time, radio host Jackie 'O' Henderson mentioned to Locky that Bella was the bookies' favourite to win his heart on the show.</p>

<p>But he deflected this by saying: 'I was paying a favourite for Survivor on Sportsbet, and I clearly didn't win. They don't know what they're talking about.'</p>
