<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An accountant who bashed his wife to death with a wheel brace has been sentenced to 10 years jail for stealing $6million to fund his gambling habit.</p>

<p>But Ahmed Dawood Seedat, 37, who is serving a life sentence for killing 32-year-old Fahima Yusuf and burying her in a shallow grave in the garden of their Perth home, will serve both terms concurrently - meaning he won't spend anymore time in jail.  </p>

<p>A probe into his financial affairs revealed a staggering list of 20 people who fell victim to theft and fraud at the hands of the disgraced accountant.</p>

<p>Ahmed Dawood Seedat, 37, is serving a life sentence for killing 32-year-old Fahima Yusuf and burying her in a shallow grave in the garden of their home in the Perth suburb of Carlisle </p>

<p>A separate probe into Seedat's (right) financial affairs revealed a staggering list of 20 people who fell victim to theft and fraud at the hands of the disgraced accountant </p>

<p>On Tuesday he faced WA District Court and was sentenced after pleading guilty to the 97 fraud and theft offences.</p>

<p>The court heard the 37-year-old stole money from 20 family members and friends between November 2013 and August 2018, with the crimes only discovered after his murder charge, NCA Newswire reported. </p>

<p>Judge John Prior said the offending was 'one of the largest thefts or frauds that I am aware of in this century'.</p>

<p>From 2013, he fleeced millions of dollars from the accounts of customers who hired him for his 13 years of accounting expertise.</p>

<p>He then used the stolen money - which were plundered in lump sums ranging from $5 to $1,621,948 per transaction - to fund his gambling addiction.</p>

<p>Seedat, who was both a director and accountant at Banks Group but was never registered as a financial adviser, put other people's money into his accounts and forged paperwork.</p>

<p>Victim impact statements explained that Seedat promised to increase client's superannuation, but took their money instead.</p>

<p>'The lifestyle they expected in retirement has been greatly diminished and they will have to work longer before they retire and in some cases, rely on government pensions for assistance,' Mr Prior said.</p>

<p>Mr Prior told Seedat he had 'destroyed' his victim's future plans.</p>

<p>Ms Yusuf's body was found in a shallow grave in their backyard four days after her murder</p>

<p>In one instance, a victim was forced to sell her personal belongings to get by as she was struggling to find work.</p>

<p>He also transferred the deeds of a house into his name and left an elderly client to face eviction. </p>

<p>Seedat was also appointed the power of attorney by his father, who moved overseas and sold his $1.6million home, but instead of investing the money he put it into his own accounts.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old later stole another $10,000 from his own father.</p>

<p>'You stole what was, in effect, their future,' Judge Prior said.</p>

<p>'Your offending behaviour was deliberate, deceptive, systematic and continuing.'</p>

<p>Seedat's fraud sentence will run concurrently with his life term for murder, which was handed down last year.</p>

<p>The father-of-two was described as egotistical, callous and cowardly by the judge after it was revealed he used Google to research how to bury someone alive. </p>

<p>During his murder trial, the Supreme Court heard that he was no longer attracted to his wife and felt that he couldn't meet her 'sexual demands'.  </p>

<p>A disturbing list of his online search history (pictured) also suggested he harboured a secret desire for his sister-in-law</p>

<p>He began bludgeoning her with a wheel brace - a steel rod used to change car tyres - despite her efforts to fight back. He then buried her in the backyard (pictured)</p>

<p>Piles of soil were dug up in the backyard of the home as part of the extensive police investigation</p>

<p>A disturbing list of his online search history also suggested he harboured a secret desire for his sister-in-law, having researched terms including [sic] 'can u marry ur brother in law' and 'can u marry ur brother in law if the sister is dead muslim'. </p>

<p>Seedat told police officers on the night of the murder that he killed his wife of eight years because she tried to come on to him. </p>

<p>He began bludgeoning her with a wheel brace - a steel rod used to change car tyres - despite her efforts to fight back.</p>

<p>He used a pillow to smother Ms Yusuf's screams and told the court her last words were 'I love you'.</p>

<p>The court heard Seedat's gambling problem and penchant for prostitutes was his way of coping with lack of sexual fulfilment in his marriage, and fed his addiction with stolen money.</p>

<p>'It is difficult to see how the gambling would have given you any fulfilment or improved your ego, given the substantial losses you suffered. These problems have a way of becoming a vicious cycle,' Justice Fiannaca said. </p>

<p>'The collapse of your financial circumstances and the squandering of millions as a result of your gambling was a significant factor in your personal circumstances leading to you killing your wife.'  </p>
