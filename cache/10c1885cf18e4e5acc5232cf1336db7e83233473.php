<p>West End superstar Alfie Boe appears to have brought the curtain down on his 16-year marriage by putting the family home up for sale</p>

<p>The singer, dubbed the People's Tenor, only moved into the glorious Cotswold property two years ago, having previously been based in America. Now, the 300-year-old grade II listed house is available for a cool £2.5 million</p>

<p>Its appearance on the market comes less than a month after reports that Boe had joined a high-end dating app after splitting with his American wife Sarah</p>

<p>The couple, who have two children, Grace, 12 and Alfred, eight, as well as a Golden Retriever called Redford and two cats, are said to have had an increasingly strained relationship which finally fractured during the nationwide Lockdown</p>

<p>Boe, 46, met Sarah, a Shakesperean actress, back in 2002 after he beat off thousands of hopefuls to land the lead role in Baz Luhrmann's revival of Puccini's La Boheme in San Francisco</p>

<p>The couple, who have two children, Grace, 12 and Alfred, eight, as well as a Golden Retriever called Redford and two cats, are said to have had an increasingly strained relationship which finally fractured during the nationwide Lockdown. </p>

<p>It will be a devastating blow for the singer who in early 2019 told MailOnline how contented he was with his life and how his idea of happiness was watching his children grow up.</p>

<p>They married two years later but despite the arrival of children and his career going into the stratosphere with a million album sales and lead roles on the West End, they only moved to England in July 2018.</p>

<p>Now their Grade II listed property, set near the village of Chalford, is being marketed by Murrays, a Stroud-based estate agent.</p>

<p>They describe it as being a four to five bedroom house set in seven acres of ancient meadows and woodlands, with a two bedroom annexe in the grounds. </p>

<p>A spokeswoman for Murrays Estate Agents said: 'The Stroud Valley has become a most popular place to live and we are often marketing delightful properties, of which this is one.</p>

<p>'It is very fairly priced. We have just put a 2 bedroom property on the market for a million so that should give you some idea of what you pay around here.'</p>

<p>Boe, who is of Irish and Norwegian descent, is the youngest of nine children from Blackpool and started his working life as an apprentice mechanic with TVR.</p>

<p>His habit of singing arias as he polished the cars got him noticed by an influential client who suggested he audition with an opera company in London.</p>

<p>He became one of Britain's most celebrated classical stars, landing the role of Jean Valjean for the 25th anniversary performance of Les Miserables in 2010 and singing for the Queen twice, at her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and for her 90th birthday four years later.</p>

<p>He has spoken about how he wants opera to shed its stuffy image and how he welcomes audiences getting out of their seats and even throwing their underwear at the stage.</p>

<p>Last year he was awarded the OBE but now he and his wife have joined a host of celebrities whose marriages have ended amidst the Covid-inspired Lockdown.</p>

<p>Last month it was reported that Boe had joined the elite, application-only Raya dating app used by stars such as Cara Delevingne and Drew Barrymore, where he had been messaging women saying that his marriage was over.</p>
