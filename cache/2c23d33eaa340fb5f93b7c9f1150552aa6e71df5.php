<p>The iconic sitcom - which ran for seven season between 1985 and 1992 - revolved around the lives of four white women living together in Miami, but the new project will seek to 'reimagine' the situation from a black perspective. </p>

<p>Fans should not get too excited about the beloved program returning to the airwaves, however, as the revival appears to be a one-night special set to be broadcast over Zoom.  </p>

<p>The Golden Girls is being revived with an all-black cast that features (clockwise from top) Regina King, Tracee Ellis Ross, Alfre Woodard and Sanaa Lathan</p>

<p>The original sitcom - which ran for seven season between 1985 and 1992 - revolved around the lives of four white women living together in Miami</p>

<p>Ross, 47, announced news of the revival in an Instagram post over the weekend, revealing that she will be reinterpreting Betty White's character, Rose Nylund.  </p>

<p>King will take the role of Dorothy Zbornak, made famous by Bea Arthur. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Nip/Tuck star Sanaa Lathan will play the character of Blanche Devereaux and 12 Years A Slave's Alfre Woodard is set to appear as Sophia Petrillo. </p>

<p>The special will be streamed live and is a partnership between Zoom and Color of Change - the nation's largest online racial justice organization. </p>

<p>It's unclear whether the women will be doing a table read that repurposes an original episode, or whether an entirely new script has been devised. </p>

<p>Ross's Instagram post was inundated with comments from excited fans who appear unable to wait for the live event. </p>

<p>'ll be watching! Signed up and ready!' one fan cooed. </p>

<p>'Dreams come true!' swooned another. </p>

<p>A third stated: 'I swear I been telling people we needed a black Golden Girls'. </p>

<p>However, there were numerous people who were offended by the idea of the actresses 'messing with a classic'. </p>

<p>Nip/Tuck star Sanaa Lathan (left) will play the character of Blanche Devereaux, while Alfre Woodard (right) will round out the new all-black quartet, playing the part of Sophia Petrillo</p>

<p>'Please no . I mean no disrespect, but The Golden Girls is a classic and it should stay that way!!' one stated. </p>

<p>One black follower said they didn't see the point in changing the race of the original characters.  </p>

<p>'As much as I would love to see y'all make magic together, it would be nice to see an original piece of work and leave this classic alone. I would never want to see white counterparts redo your original work or anyone for that matter. I love y'all too much not to support but I'm just saying... ' they wrote. </p>
