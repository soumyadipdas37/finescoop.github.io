<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 33-year-old woman is the first West Australian to be forced to wear an ankle bracelet after allegedly breaching quarantine by entertaining visitors.</p>

<p>The woman was fitted with the monitoring device on Friday after police said they caught two men at her Perth home on Thursday during a routine check on her mandatory 14-day isolation.</p>

<p>She had been allowed to enter the state from New South Wales on September 1, but was told to isolate herself for two weeks' coronavirus quarantine at a private Perth residence, WA Police said in a statement on Saturday.</p>

<p>A 33-year-old woman has become the first West Australian to be fitted with an ankle bracelet (stock image pictured) after allegedly entertaining two men at her home during quarantine</p>

<p>WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson (pictured) who is also the WA State Emergency Coordinator, personally ordered the anklet to be fitted</p>

<p>The woman was fined $1,000 and was moved to a quarantine hotel.</p>

<p>She will not be allowed to remove the anklet until the end of her quarantine. </p>

<p>'After careful consideration of the circumstances of the breach and the woman's previous history, the State Emergency Coordinator formed a view that it was necessary to monitor her location during the quarantine period,' WA Police said in a statement. </p>

<p>West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said last month that people who were considered a flight-risk or who had a criminal history may be forced to wear the anklets. </p>

<p>Lockdown dodger Isata Jalloh, 19, (pictured) was fined $5,000 for flying from Adelaide to Perth and escaping hotel quarantine to go to a rap party with her friend Banchi Techana </p>

<p>Isata Jalloh and Banchi Techana (pictured together at Perth Airport) made rude gestures as they were put on a taxpayer funded flight back to Adelaide, telling media they were not sorry</p>

<p>WA Police Commissioner Chris Dawson, who is also the WA State Emergency Coordinator, personally ordered the anklet to be fitted.  </p>

<p>Premier McGowan said he supported Mr Dawson's decision, saying it was for the safety of the community, and he hoped it sent a strong message to people who think they can break the state's coronavirus laws.</p>

<p>'You will be caught and you will have to face the full force of the law. Selfish behaviour in the middle of a pandemic will not be tolerated,' he told the West Australian newspaper.</p>

<p>Western Australia has so far bought 200 ankle bracelets for the pandemic.</p>

<p>Premier McGowan said the state had purchased the devices immediately after giving WA Police the emergency powers to order monitoring where necessary.  </p>

<p>The woman is the first in Western Australia to be fitted with a monitoring anklet under the state's coronavirus State of Emergency laws.</p>

<p>West Australian man Paul John Lawrence had been expected to be the first person to get the anklet for coronavirus quarantine breach after he allegedly returned to WA in late August without first applying for permission to enter the state, however that did not eventuate.</p>

<p>Mr Lawrence had been visiting family in Queensland when he returned without permission, and at Perth Airport complained of chest pains.</p>

<p>He was taken to hospital for treatment and told to wait for transport to a quarantine hotel.</p>

<p>WA Premier Mark McGowan (pictured) backed Commissioner Dawson's decision. Western Australia has bought 200 monitoring anklets for the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Paul John Lawrence (pictured) was told to wait in hospital for a transport to quarantine after arriving in Perth from Queensland last month. Instead he ran away to a pub in Northbridge</p>

<p>Instead of waiting, Mr Lawrence left the hospital and checked into a Northbridge backpacker hostel, then went to the nearest pub - the Hotel Northbridge, sparking a dramatic manhunt.</p>

<p>Mr Lawrence was not fitted with the ankle bracelet, instead he was put into hotel quarantine under police guard and tested for coronavirus, with the tests coming back negative.</p>

<p>The pub was closed for a night as a precaution and 150 patrons feared they would catch the virus.</p>

<p>In another high-profile quarantine breach, a man used a ladder to climb in and out of his third-floor room in a Perth quarantine hotel.</p>

<p>Yusuf Karakaya had managed to open the window, walked across a roof space and escaped, only to return with a ladder which he used repeatedly to breach quarantine over the next few days.</p>

<p>When hotel staff removed the ladder, he got someone to bring him another one, Perth Now reported. </p>

<p>He was sentenced to six months' jail but was only ordered to spend one month in prison with five months suspended. </p>

<p>In another quarantine breach, two women flew from Adelaide to WA without permission to 'hang out with friends' at a Perth rapper's party.</p>

<p>Isata Jalloh, 19, and Banchi Techana, 22, were taken to the Novotel on Murray Street in Perth's CBD but ran away, escaping out of an emergency exit.</p>

<p>Techana was given a suspended jail term of eight months and two weeks, while Jalloh was fined $5000, the West Australian reported. </p>

<p>The pair were taken back to hotel quarantine before making obscene gestures as they were placed on a taxpayer-funded flight back to South Australia last month.</p>

<p>Jalloh and Techana were unrepentant, telling media they were not sorry and would return to Western Australia in two months, by force if necessary.</p>

<p>Western Australia recorded no new coronavirus cases on Saturday, with their total pandemic case tally unchanged at 659. </p>

<p>Australia has so far had 26,565 coronavirus cases according to the national Health Department's website.</p>
