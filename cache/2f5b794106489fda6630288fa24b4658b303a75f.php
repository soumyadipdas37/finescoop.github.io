<p>Straight off the runway: She has walked for Victoria's Secret - and Leomie Anderson looked like she had strutted off the catwalk as she stepped out in London on Tuesday </p>

<p>Leomie displayed her toned stomach in the sculpting two-piece from activewear company, Lapp The Brand. </p>

<p>She paired the look with colourful Nike trainers and a Dior rucksack. </p>

<p>The catwalk model styled her raven tresses in a textured high ponytail and opted for low-key make-up that highlighted her stunning features. </p>

<p>Leomie recently joined forces with TOWIE star Vas J Morgan, actress Jodie Turner-Smith and Little Mix's Leigh-Anne Pinnock to raise mental health awareness for the black community. </p>

<p>Top of the crops: The supermodel, 27, displayed her svelte physique in a form-fitting sporty blue crop top as she arrived at the Capital Xtra offices in Leicester Square </p>

<p>In the powerful video campaign, the stars all wore charity t-shirts as they emotionally declared: 'I am enough,' among other messages of empowerment.   </p>

<p>Starting the video, Jodie, 34, said: 'I allow myself to be the full expression of who I really am.'  </p>

<p>Leigh-Anne, 28, added: 'My race is healthy and good.' </p>

<p>Vas announced: 'My sexuality is healthy and good.' </p>

<p>Sporty look: The catwalk queen teamed her zip-up top with matching cobalt and lilac leggings as she headed inside</p>

<p>The former TOWIE star, 31, created the powerful video to help those dealing with trauma, racism or mental health related issues. </p>

<p>He added: 'Mental health awareness is very important and it's vital to say it, repeat it, believe it and share it. I am Vas J Morgan and I am enough.' </p>

<p>Talking about what the campaign means to him in a passionate statement, the star added: 'Like so many black people, my mental health has been deeply impacted by events this year. </p>

<p>'For me, they have brought back a lot of traumatic memories of low self-esteem and self-hate, essentially being told that black was wrong. </p>

<p>'If I was feeling this way, I knew many others within the black community would be feeling exactly the same too. </p>

<p>'I've been fortunate to have received extensive treatment for my own mental battles in the past but know many aren't so lucky. </p>

<p>'This is why I wanted to launch this campaign, to show people that they are enough and provide them with the vital support they need.'</p>

<p>The end of the video promotes the charity T-shirts which are available to buy online, with all proceeds donated to the I Am Enough fund, providing free mental health support for the black community. </p>

<p>So far, the campaign has raised more than £50,000. </p>
