<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She welcomed her first child, son Oscar, with husband Peter Stefanovic in February.</p>

<p>And on Monday, Sylvia Jeffreys shared a sweet photo to Instagram of the six-month-old dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time.</p>

<p>In the hilarious picture, which was taken at Sydney's Bronte Beach, the child screwed up his nose and did not appear to be enjoying the milestone.</p>

<p>Not happy, mum! Sylvia Jeffreys has shared a photo of her son, Oscar, dipping his toes into the ocean for the first time at Bronte Beach. Oscar is pictured with his father, Peter Stefanovic</p>

<p>'It was all fun and games until his toes touched the water,' Sylvia, 34, captioned the snap.</p>

<p>'Definitely a Queenslander,' she added, referencing the fact that both she and Peter, 38, were born and raised in the Sunshine State.</p>

<p>In the image, Peter held on to Oscar reassuringly as he took his first dip in the ocean.</p>

<p>Much better: Peter later shared an image of Oscar looking much happier back on the sand as he cuddled up with his mother (Sylvia and Oscar pictured) </p>

<p>The baby looked adorable in a powder blue cap, grey T-shirt and patterned shorts.</p>

<p>Peter, who hosts Sky News' breakfast show, displayed his fit physique by going shirtless in a pair of red boardshorts.</p>

<p>He later shared another image of Oscar looking much happier back on the sand as he cuddled up with his mother.</p>

<p>Their favourite spot: The family are regulars along Bronte Beach, and often take their son for walks there and occasionally use the swings. Pictured: Sylvia with her son, Oscar</p>

<p>Sylvia, who hosts Nine's Today Extra, protected herself from the sun in a large straw hat and sunglasses, and also wore a denim jacket and shorts.</p>

<p>Despite Oscar being just six months old, Silvia is eagerly practising her baking skills ahead of his first birthday.</p>

<p>She recently revealed she was planning to make a racing car cake for the big day in February.</p>

<p>She even made a trial cake, and kindly gifted it to her Nine colleague Ben Fordham.</p>
