I haven't heard anything back, have witnessed it since. It's not good enough.'</p>

<p>But several shared positive experiences while visiting the chain, particularly at other branches of PureGym across the country.</p>

<p>Ian Morgan tweeted: 'Big up to #puregym Canterbury. Totally different experience.'</p>

<p>Caz Brown commented: 'Not had a problem with Bitterne, feel totally safe going there. Always being cleaned and if one cleaning station waiting for refill there are plenty to use.'</p>

<p>Chris Gibbs added: 'Pleased to say that <?php echo e('@'); ?>PureGymSwindon are being amazing and I couldn't feel happier and safer in there. They are gm doing a great job... (Except when their excellent PTs push me to want to cry... burpees are evil!).' </p>

<p>In response to Joe's post, several PureGym members across the country said their experience has been positive</p>

<p>A spokesperson for PureGym told FEMAIL: 'We are disappointed to learn of this member’s experience at our gym in Finchley where our hygiene stations had run out of cleaning paper. </p>

<p>'We are working hard to ensure all hygiene stations are kept stocked at all times and have strong TrainSafe protocols which see gyms cleaned five times a day, with a deep clean overnight. </p>

<p>'Member feedback both nationally and at this gym is very strong at 4.5/5 for equipment and gym floor cleanliness at Finchley. </p>

<p>'A number of our gyms have been visited by Environmental Health Officers without issue and we have welcomed over 8 million members, across the UK and Europe, to our more than 500 gyms, with no instances of transmission.' </p>
