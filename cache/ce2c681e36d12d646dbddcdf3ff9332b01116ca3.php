<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle striker Dwight Gayle will undergo surgery on Saturday to repair damaged knee ligaments and is facing up to three months out, Sportsmail can reveal.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old visited a specialist this week, where it was confirmed he needs an operation after injuring his medial collateral ligaments during a pre-season friendly against Crewe last month.</p>

<p>The recovery time will be between 10 and 12 weeks, meaning it is likely to be December before he returns.</p>

<p>Dwight Gayle will go under the knife on Saturday to have surgery on his knee ligament injury</p>

<p>It is a blow for head coach Steve Bruce, who almost certainly would have started the campaign with Gayle as his first-choice frontman had he been fit.</p>

<p>Gayle looked sharp as he scored four times during the closing weeks of last season and his loss has heightened Bruce’s need for a new striker.</p>

<p>The manager wants Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson but it remains to be seen if Newcastle’s hierarchy will make a formal offer after Aston Villa saw a £15million bid rejected on Friday.</p>

<p>As it stands, Andy Carroll is set to start against former club West Ham next weekend.</p>

<p>Andy Carroll is likely to start up top for the opening game of the season against West Ham </p>
