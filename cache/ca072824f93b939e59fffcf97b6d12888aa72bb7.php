<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has saluted new recruit Thiago Alcantara's 'exceptional' qualities, declaring the Spanish midfielder a perfect addition to the Premier League champions' squad ahead of his full debut against Arsenal.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old is widely regarded as one of the best midfielders in the world and Klopp believes he has key attributes that set him out from others. </p>

<p>He moved from European champions Bayern Munich for a £25million fee having won the last seven Bundesliga titles with the German giants and played in last month's Champions League final win over Paris Saint-Germain. </p>

<p>Midfielder Thiago Alcantara signed for Liverpool on a four-year deal from Bayern Munich  </p>

<p>Thiago made an impressive 45-minute Premier League debut in the Reds' win over Chelsea</p>

<p>He made an impressive debut as a half-time substitute for injured captain Jordan Henderson last week, making more passes than every Chelsea player on his Premier League debut - despite only playing 45 minutes.</p>

<p>And ahead of the Anfield clash with Arsenal, Klopp highlighted the experienced midfielder's attributes, both on and off the pitch.</p>

<p>'Thiago is obviously a very good football player,' Klopp told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'You saw it [against Chelsea]. Some things are natural for him that are not natural for other players, but we won the league and we won the Champions League without Thiago. </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp (left) has claimed Alcantara is a natural and a 'mature' football person</p>

<p>'He won it (Champions League) with Bayern, so obviously it is a good fit I would say, but we now have to get used to each other.' </p>

<p>Thiago was rested for last week's Carabao Cup victory over Lincoln and sat out training in recent days meaning he will have a late fitness test on Monday for the Gunners clash. </p>

<p>Whether he is fit to play or not Klopp added: 'There are very special things [he has that separates him from others] in world football. </p>

<p>'His vision is exceptional, pair that with pretty good technical skills, and a nice passing ability and these kind of things, and you become a really interesting package. </p>

<p>'On top of that as a guy, he couldn't be better. It's incredible, when you give him a ball, he is still a kid.</p>

<p>'And when you take the ball away he is a really mature and experienced football person, who is interested in a lot of things, tactics and all these kind of things. He wants to learn which is very important.' </p>
