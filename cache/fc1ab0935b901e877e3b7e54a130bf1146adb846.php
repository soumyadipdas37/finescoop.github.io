<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This is the moment an excited Rottweiler ran out into its owner's garden to splash around in a rare rainfall in a Las Vegas suburb.</p>

<p>Amber Opheikens filmed her rottweiler Tank jumping up-and-down in the downpour on her patio in Henderson, Nevada, after months without any measurable rain.</p>

<p>In the footage, taken on September 21, the water-loving hound stands on its hind legs and sticks its tongue out to try and catch the falling raindrops.</p>

<p>The energetic dog runs across the patio at speed and seemingly cannot cope with the excitement of the rare downpour.</p>

<p>Rottweiler Tank tried to catch raindrops in its mouth on September 21 as Henderson, Nevada, enjoyed a rare downpour after more than 150 days without rain</p>

<p>Ms Opheikens can be heard saying to Tank: 'Get the rain, get it Tank!'</p>

<p>The rottweiler refuses to shelter from the rainstorm during the video, continuing to splash around on the soaking wet patio. </p>

<p>Another voice is heard shouting in surprise: 'Oh my God, it is raining so much!'</p>

<p>In the video, Ms Opheikens's daughter stands completely drenched with Tank in the downpour, enjoying the warm rain in shorts and a t-shirt.</p>

<p>Ms Opheikens said that although Tank 'loves anything with water', this was her dog's first time chasing the rain. </p>

<p>The downpour in Henderson came after a record stretch of 154 days without any measurable rain at McCarran International Airport, according to the National Weather Service.</p>

<p>But the small showers of rain on September 21 were isolated to Henderson and Anthem, meaning that Las Vegas continued its stretch without precipitation, breaking the previous record from 1959.</p>

<p>Amber Opheikens filmed her daughter and her dog Tank standing on her rain-soaked patio, with the water-loving hound running up-and-down the garden in the downpour</p>

<p>Ms Opheikens said that although Tank 'loves anything with water', this was her dog's first time chasing the rain on their patio</p>

<p>It is reported that there has been no rain measured at McCarran International Airport, home of the National Weather Service's Las Vegas rain gauge, since April 20.</p>

<p>Residents have been warned by scientists to expect the lack of rain in this year's monsoon season to continue, according to the Las Vegas Sun.</p>

<p>Professor of geoscience at UNLV said it is not 'altogether uncommon' for the monsoon to fail, referring to years including 2010 and 1962. </p>

<p>He added: 'Climate change is influencing the amount of water available when there is water. Of course when there’s zero monsoon, then there’s zero water.'</p>

<p>Nevada's wetter season normally lasts from July until March, with the chance of a wet day being greater than seven per cent, Weatherspark reported.</p>
