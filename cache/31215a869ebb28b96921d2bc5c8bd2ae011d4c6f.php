<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The way shoppers' personal data is handled by big online retailers is laid bare in new research.  </p>

<p>All online retailers ask for some level of personal information to be submitted when a customer completes an order through there store, whether it is a full name, delivery address or card payment details. </p>

<p>However what differs between companies is the amount of information they store once a purchase is complete, how this information is used within the company, and whether this information is shared or sold to third parties at a later date.</p>

<p>To determine which company is best at protecting customer information, UK-based data management company Rightly analysed the data protection policies of 10 major online retailers, including Zara, Boohoo.com and Amazon. </p>

<p>Findings reveal how retailers store data on everything from clothing sizes to internet search histories, as well as which companies pass on this information to others. </p>

<p>eBay is the only company that was found to sell data to third parties, while H&amp;M is the only retailer that does not share or sell customer data. </p>

<p>As online shopping grows in popularity, it is important to be aware of how companies are using our data and if and how they are sharing and selling it. Research by Rightly of ten of the top UK retailers revealed several companies share their customers information with third party companies and one even sells the information for profit.
