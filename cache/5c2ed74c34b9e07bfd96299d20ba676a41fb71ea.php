<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The US Air Force tested a 'flying car' that could soon be part of its flying arsenal. </p>

<p>Made by Texas-based LIFT Aircraft, Hexa is a lightweight 432-pound craft that runs on 18 independent rotors. The occupant is not required to have a pilot's license.</p>

<p>The vehicle is controlled by a joystick and powered with a 'triply redundant autopilot computer' that, according to its creator, makes it safer than maneuvering a small traditional plane.</p>

<p>The military watched from Camp Mabry, a base near Austin, Texas, as Hexa lifted off from the ground and hovered overhead. </p>

<p>LIFT CEO Matt Chasen pilots Hexa over Camp Mabry on August 20. The prototype electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) craft uses 18 independent rotors and is controlled by a three-axis joystick</p>

<p>The test flight was part of Agility Prime, a partnership between private aerospace firms and the Air Force that's meant to add flying cars to the military's fleet and speed up their introduction in the consumer market. </p>

<p>Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett and Air Force Chief of Staff General Charles Q. Brown, Jr were on hand on August 20 to watch Hexa, a prototype electric vertical takeoff and landing flight (eVTOL) vehicle, fly above the base.</p>

<p>LIFT CEO Matthew Chasen piloted Hexa during the demonstration, </p>

<p>It's controlled by a three-axis joystick that LIFT CEO Matthew Chasen claims anyone can use - without a pilot's license.  </p>

<p>'We're making flying so simple, safe and inexpensive that anyone can do it with very little skill or special training,' he said in a 2018 interview.</p>

<p>'We're truly consumerizing flying for the first time in history.' </p>

<p>Hexa is approved to fly to heights of 700 feet, or 1,200 feet in some locations, but not over populated areas.  </p>

<p>'The thought of an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle - a flying car - might seem straight out of a Hollywood movie,' Secretary Barrett said in April, when the partnership first launched.</p>

<p>Chasen (right) talks to Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett (seated). With joystick controls and a 'triply redundant' autopilot system, Chasen says, Hexa is safer than piloting a traditional small aircraft. And it doesn't require a pilot's license</p>

<p>'But by partnering today with stakeholders across industries and agencies, we can set up the United States for this aerospace phenomenon.'</p>

<p>Participating firms can perfect eVTOL technology without having to get additional time-consuming safety certification from the FAA, Task and Purpose reported.</p>

<p>The Air Force is spending $25 million on Agility Prime this year, according to Inside Defense.</p>

<p>The race to launch a commercially viable eVTOL vehicle is in full gear: Airbus, Boeing and Uber are all developing concept crafts, while the Japanese government is hoping to have a flying car on the market by 2023.</p>

<p>Tokyo-based SkyDrive recently unveiled the SD-XX, a two-person eVTOL craft that can reach a max speed of about 62mph.</p>

<p>Tokyo-based SkyDrive recently unveiled the SD-XX, a two-person eVTOL craft that can reach a max speed of about 62mph. Billed as the world's smallest flying car, it can fit inside two conventional parking spots</p>

<p>Billed as the world's smallest flying car, the eight-propeller vehicle measures just 11 by 13 feet and can fit inside two conventional parking spots</p>

<p>Using an autopilot with a backup human pilot for emergencies, the SD-XX would initially serve as an air taxi shuttling guests to resorts and hotels, according to Japan Times.</p>

<p>By 2050, SkyDrive CEO Tomohiro Fukuzawa says, anyone will be able to fly it to almost any destination in Tokyo within 10 minutes.</p>
