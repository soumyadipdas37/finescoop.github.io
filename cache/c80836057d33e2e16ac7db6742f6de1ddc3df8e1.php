<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>What do you think the biggest footwear trend is for autumn 2020? Go on, have a guess.</p>

<p>Heels? Hardly. Platforms? Think again. Thigh-high boots? Miles off. It’s wellies. Yes, really.</p>

<p>The autumn/winter catwalk shows were a festival (and we use the word advisedly) of rubberised, tractor-soled boots in all manner of heights, shapes and colours. While a few of these luxe wellies are rather impractical (Versace’s high-heeled design springs to mind); most of the styles are very wearable.</p>

<p>British style expert Anna Pursglove, shared her advice for style throughout autumn and winter. Pictured: Coat, £59.90, uniqlo.com; knit, £156, whistles.com; skirt, £39, and boots, £89, topshop.com; bag, £115, hunterboots.com</p>

<p>Coat, £150, dress, £34.50, and bag, £59, cosstores. com; roll-neck, £26.97, gap. co.uk (worn throughout); boots, £148, whistles.com; hat, £3, topshop.com</p>

<p>The price tags may prove a puddle too far. Bottega Veneta’s Tire boots, for example, won’t leave you a lot of change from £900. But, luckily, the High Street has jumped straight on to this trend.</p>

<p>The Alonzo black and red boots at Topshop (third from right), for instance, bear more than a passing resemblance to the aforementioned Tire boots, but are a tenth of the price.</p>

<p>Ever since Kate Moss strolled into Glastonbury in 2005 wearing Hunter wellies with tiny shorts and a waistcoat, fashion has been in love with the British brand and, in particular, that tall style (hunter boots.com, £95). And now they come in just about any colour you can think of.</p>

<p>Hiking boots are also proving popular. If you can’t afford designer brands such as Penelope Chilvers and Grenson, try the insulated commando ones from Hunter (£125) or the Amber lace-up pair from Whistles (second from left).</p>

<p>Happily raincoats are also a ‘thing’ this season. (In our household, they’re never not a ‘thing’, but that’s fashion for you.) Trench coats are big for autumn, both literally and metaphorically. I love the oversized gingham design (third from right) from Alexa Chung’s Barbour range. If you want something less voluminous, then try Topshop’s vinyl shacket (third from left).</p>

<p>With the big ticket items sorted, you might want to invest in some accessories, such as a bucket hat. It’s a divisive item, and many would rather stick with a trusty umbrella. However, do consider that Topshop’s check hat (second from left) won’t get forgotten at the door of a cafe, will fit in your pocket, and is unlikely to take an eye out in a gale.</p>

<p>When it comes to weather-proofed bags, meanwhile, have a look at Cos’s quilted oversized bag (second from left).</p>

<p>What with everyone staycationing and socialising outdoors due to Covid, I’m grateful for these useful trends. You could call it the perfect fashion storm.</p>
