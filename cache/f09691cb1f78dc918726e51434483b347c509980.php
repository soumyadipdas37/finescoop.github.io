<p>The 25-year-old hadn't played for the Titans since he was dropped in July and relocated to NSW with his wife Shanelle and their two children, Koa and Naia. </p>

<p>Bryce Cartwright (pictured with wife Shanelle) has listed his million dollar home just days after he was sacked by the Gold Coast Titans</p>

<p>The home in Highview Court in Currumbin is three-storeys and comes with a two-car garage</p>

<p>The four-bedroom home, which has views of the ocean as well as the Surfers Paradise skyline, was only built in 2018.</p>

<p>The master-bedroom has its own private balcony as well as floor to ceiling windows, meanwhile the second storey has a seperate courtyard and study.</p>

<p>The Gold Coast home also boasts a pool in the backyard. </p>

<p>The footy star and his wife reportedly bought the home in 2018 for $1.29million.</p>

<p>Cartwright left the Penrith Panthers to join the Titans ahead of the 2018 season on a $2million four-year deal.</p>

<p>Touted as a future NSW State of Origin prospect following a strong start to his career at Penrith, Cartwright made the move to the Titans to work under ex-coach Garth Brennan. </p>

<p>Just one week before he was sacked the second-rower said he was struggling to stay motivated.</p>

<p>'The critics don't see what you go through. My knees swell up and I have to get it drained all the time. We get paid good money, but it's not an easy ride,' he told the Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Captain Kevin Proctor said he was worried about his teammate.</p>

<p>'I know he's had some family dramas and he's gone to Sydney to sort some stuff out,' he said. </p>

<p>'It's disappointing to lose him through this period but hopefully he is OK with his family.' </p>

<p>The anti-vaxxer made headlines in May when he was granted permission to play despite refusing a mandatory influenza vaccination under the NRL's return-to-play regulations.</p>

<p>Cartwright and his wife unwittingly became the face of the anti-vaxxer movement when they announced they would not be giving their children vaccinations</p>

<p>Cartwright also made headlines in May when he was granted permission to play despite refusing a mandatory influenza vaccination under the NRL's return-to-play regulations</p>

<p>The Titans submitted an application for a medical exemption which was granted by Queensland's chief medical officer Jeannette Young.</p>

<p>Cartwright and his wife also sparked controversy last year when they publicly declared they would not vaccinate their young children, unwittingly becoming the face of the anti-vaxxer movement.</p>

<p>Earlier this week he said his family - including his children - had received sickening threats following their views on vaccinations. </p>

<p>'I don't want to go too much into it but yeah, it involved my children,' he told Nine News.</p>

<p>'I have little things like meditation ... to clear my head and it can be as simple as just going for a swim, staying off my phone and taking the kids the beach.'</p>

<p>The footy star said he hasn't lost his passion for rugby league and has since been working with a sprint trainer to help turn his career around. </p>
