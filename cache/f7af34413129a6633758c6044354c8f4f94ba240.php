<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>From the 'freefall' to the 'foetal', the differing sleeping positions favoured by high and lower earners have been revealed.</p>

<p>A survey of more than 5,000 British professionals found 29 per cent of those earning more than £54,900 a year prefer to sleep with their arms and legs spread out either side of them – a position known as 'the freefall'. </p>

<p>By contrast, 29 per cent of people earning less than that figure prefer the foetal position, followed by the 'pillow hugger'.</p>

<p>Christabel Majendie, a sleep expert at Naturalmat, shared her expertise after the survey by Onbuy.com. She said: 'Poor-quality sleep is associated with reduced daytime performance, and this includes your professional life.'</p>

<p>'It is important to be comfortable when you sleep so consider your mattress and bedding. Sleep in a position that is comfortable for you – this varies from person to person.'</p>

<p>Here, a closer look at the sleeping positions chosen by those on high and lower incomes…</p>
