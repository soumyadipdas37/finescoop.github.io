<p>The new collection was met with intrigue on social media, with some hailing the idea as 'genius', while others insisted that matching a manicure to a PopSocket is a style step too far in their opinion.</p>

<p>'I am exactly this extra and I’m broke but getting some anyway,' one person commented on Instagram, while another simply wrote: 'Cute! Love the colors!' </p>

<p>One person then chimed in: 'So exciting! Thanks for making my dream a reality.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile on Twitter, one user poked fun at the idea - however quickly admitted that she is still planning to buy them for herself, writing: 'So wait, [you] can match your PopSocket [with] your nails now!? That must be the stupidest idea since sliced bread. </p>

<p>'Lmao, j/k y’all want some of my money? Bet.'</p>

<p>Not everyone was impressed with the concept however, including one person on Twitter who commented: 'Is anyone else like super f**king confused by PopSocket nails??'</p>
