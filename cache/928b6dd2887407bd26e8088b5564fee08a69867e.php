<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gonzalo Higuain's time at Juventus is coming to an end after his agent reportedly arrived in Italy to negotiate his exit ahead of a move to Inter Miami.</p>

<p>The Argentine striker is surplus to requirement at the Allianz Stadium and Andrea Pirlo is looking to replace him with Barcelona forward Luis Suarez.</p>

<p>And according to Sky Sport Italia, Tuttomercatoweb and more Italian outlets, they claim that Higuain's brother - Nicolas - landed in Italy on Tuesday for negotiations with Juventus over his departure.</p>

<p>Gonzalo Higuain is nearing a move to David Beckham's Inter Miami from Serie A side Juventus</p>

<p>He is set to meet Juventus' directors on Wednesday to discuss details of terminating Higuain's contract by mutual consent a year early - with talks set over how much of his remaining £6.3million net salary he will receive.</p>

<p>Once those talks have concluded, Higuain is likely to link up with David Beckham at his new MLS franchise Inter Miami.</p>

<p>The 32-year-old Argentine striker, who has won three Serie A titles with the club, has been informed by new manager Andrea Pirlo that he is not part of his plans going forward.</p>

<p>It would be a big coup from Beckham if the club were to get a deal for Higuain over the line</p>

<p>Pirlo is now on the brink of capturing Uruguayan striker Suarez from Barcelona after being told he would play no part under new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman.</p>

<p>Suarez now looks set to combine with Cristiano Ronaldo after years of partnering Lionel Messi up top at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>He will be remembered very fondly in Barcelona, scoring an incredible 198 goals in 283 appearances for the Spanish giants.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez is close to leaving Barcelona after Ronald Koeman said he wasn't part of his plans</p>
