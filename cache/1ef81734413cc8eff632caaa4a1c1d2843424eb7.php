<p>Rachel has been busy celebrating 29 years with her husband Rodger Berman at the swanky Rosewood Miramar Beach hotel in Santa Barbara, California.</p>

<p>Rachel began dating Rodger while attending college in Washington, D.C. in 1991, followed by their wedding in 1996.</p>

<p>The couple are also parents to  Skyler Morrison. </p>

<p>Sweet moment: Rachel doted on her youngest son, Kaius Jagger, six, before he went boogie-boarding, putting lotion on his face </p>

<p>At the time they first met, Rodger thought Rachel was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.   </p>

<p>He told Harper's Bazaar in 2011: 'I met Rachel in the summer of 1991. She was 19, and I was 22. </p>

<p>'She was a restaurant hostess, and I was working as a waiter in Washington, D.C., where we both attended college,</p>

<p>'I vividly remember the first time I saw her, wearing a tight black minidress, high-heeled pumps, stick-straight hair, and big red lips covered in M.A.C. Chili lipstick (her trademark). </p>

<p>'She was the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen. I quickly learned that she also had more clothes than any woman I had ever seen. I often wondered if she'd ever do an outfit change mid-date.' </p>

<p>Marking the special occasion on her Instagram account, Rachel shared a throwback of herself flashing her diamond engagement ring while snuggled up to her husband.</p>

<p>'This is us. Me and my ❤️ <?php echo e('@'); ?>rbermanus long ago..and today we celebrate #29 years together on our official #firstdate #anniversary xoRZ,' she captioned the photo.</p>
