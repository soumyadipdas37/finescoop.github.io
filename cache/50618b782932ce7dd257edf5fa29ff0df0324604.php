<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>West Ham are discussing a possible Â£4million deal for Slavia Prague right back Vladimir Coufal.</p>

<p>Manager David Moyes is eager to strengthen in that position after Ryan Fredericks picked up a hamstring injury in the 4-0 win over Wolves on Sunday evening.</p>

<p>Coufal, 28, is a Czech Republic international and former team-mate of West Ham's Tomas Soucek. He was part of the Czech side that beat England 2-1 last October in the European Championship qualifiers, though struggled against the pace of Raheem Sterling.</p>

<p>Moyes is intent on adding a centre back and ideally another midfielder before the window closes.</p>

<p>After seeing bids for Burnley's James Tarkowski and St Etienne's Wesley Fofana flounder, West Ham are working through a list of other options. Fiorentina's 6ft 5ins Serbia international Nikola Milenkovic, 22, is one they are considering while Swansea's Joe Rodon is admired but unlikely.</p>

<p>Bruges' goalscoring midfielder Hans Vanaken is also among players Moyes is keen on.</p>
