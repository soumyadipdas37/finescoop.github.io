<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A British holidaymaker has died in hospital after being pulled from a Spanish hotel swimming pool in a 'critical condition.'</p>

<p>The woman was in cardiac arrest when she was pulled from the pool in Lanzarote and revived at the scene by a lifeguard and emergency responders.</p>

<p>Police on the island confirmed today she had lost her fight for life after being rushed to Doctor Jose Molina Hospital in the island capital Lanzarote.</p>

<p>A routine investigation into her death, coordinated by a local court is now underway.</p>

<p>The alarm was raised just before 5pm on Thursday by staff at the four-star HL Rio Playa</p>

<p>The dead woman is understood to have been staying at the hotel with her partner.</p>

<p>There were conflicting reports about her age, as she was initially said to have been aged 35 in a statement put out by an emergency response coordination centre whereas police sources have said she was 58.</p>

<p>One well-placed source said: 'It all happened so quickly.</p>

<p>'The lifeguard pulled her out of the water and stabilised her with CPR but sadly she died shortly after arriving at hospital.'</p>

<p>Health sources confirmed she had died in A&amp;E at Doctor Jose Molina Hospital.</p>

<p>A Civil Guard source also confirmed the British woman's death, adding: 'A routine investigation is underway but there is nothing pointing to any criminality in what happened.</p>

<p>'The investigating court will be sent the post mortem results and will instruct police to carry out any further inquiries if it is deemed appropriate.</p>

<p>'The autopsy will shed more light on what exactly occurred.'</p>

<p>In a statement released before it emerged the British woman had died, a spokesman for a regional government-run emergency coordination centre said: 'A 35-year-old British woman was pulled from the water after going into cardiac arrest and symptoms of near-drowning at a hotel in Playa Blanca in the municipality of Yaiza.</p>

<p>'The alarm was raised just before 5pm on Thursday.</p>

<p>'She was taken by ambulance to Doctor Jose Molina Orosa in a critical condition.'</p>

<p>Playa Blanca, on the south side of Lanzarote, is considered to be the third largest tourist area on the island.</p>

<p>It has one of the best pleasure ports on the island and is close to the Papagayo beaches with their white sand and crystalline waters.</p>

<p>At the end of last month two youngsters on holiday with their families died within hours of each other following separate Spanish swimming pool tragedies.</p>

<p>A child aged three drowned at a pool in Pilar de la Horadada near Torrevieja on the Costa Blanca, around 9pm on August 27.</p>

<p>Local reports said a second youngster aged six believed to be a relative had discovered the boy in the water and alerted his parents.</p>

<p>Emergency responders tried without success for nearly an hour to save his life when they reached the scene. The youngster was French.</p>

<p>The incident, at a house on a residential estate called Pinar de Campoverde, happened hours after a four-year-old boy who was rescued from a pool at a water park in Tarragona 300 miles north, lost his fight for life in hospital.</p>

<p>The youngster had been admitted to the city's Joan XXIII Hospital four days earlier.</p>

<p>He was assisted after being pulled out of a pool at the Aquopolis Costa Dorada near Salou as the water park was about to close.</p>

<p>The Pilar de la Horadada drowning was the fourth in a month in a Costa Blanca swimming pool which had claimed the life of a young child.</p>

<p>On July 29 a Dutch girl aged four drowned at a pool in Calpe north of Benidorm at the northern end of the famous stretch of coastline.</p>

<p>On August 5 a four-year-old Belgian boy was found floating in a pool at a relative's house in the Brit-popular area of Ciudad Quesada near Torrevieja where his parents had made a stopover.</p>

<p>They had only arrived hours earlier and were due to stay the night before continuing to Castellon further north.</p>

<p>Local reports said one one of his relatives, described as a nurse, jumped into the pool to pull him out and emergency responders spent nearly 45 minutes trying to revive him without success.</p>

<p>On August 9 a two-year-old boy drowned at his parents' holiday villa in nearby La Zenia.</p>

<p>His body was discovered by his teenage sister.</p>

<p>The French family had only just arrived at the villa two days before the tragedy.</p>

<p>Initial reports at the time pointed to the boy, one of five children, drowning after leaving the villa unnoticed while the rest of the family was inside.</p>
