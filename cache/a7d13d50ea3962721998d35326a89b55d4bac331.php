<p>The news comes as an outspoken Chinese tycoon who called President Xi a 'clown' over his handling of the country's coronavirus outbreak has been jailed for 18 years this week.</p>

<p>Chen arrived in Wuhan just before the city went into lockdown in hopes of providing the world with the truth of the epidemic, as he said himself.</p>

<p>His reports detailed horrific scenes - including a woman frantically calling family on her phone as she sits next to a relative lying dead in a wheelchair - and the helpless situation of patients in the overstretched hospitals.</p>

<p>Medical workers are pictured in this file photo taken on January 30 standing around a patient as he is treated for the COVID-19 coronavirus in a hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province</p>

<p>One post on his Twitter, posted in April, read: 'Who can tell us where and how Chen Qiushi is right now? When will anyone get to speak with him again? Chen Qiushi has been out of contact for 68 days after covering coronavirus in Wuhan. Please save him!!!'</p>

<p>On Thursday, Xu Xiaodong, Chen's friend and Chinese mixed-martial-arts star, said in a live-streamed YouTube video that Chen was 'in good health' but was still under supervision by a 'certain government department', according to South China Morning Post.</p>

<p>'The authorities have investigated his activities on the mainland, Hong Kong and Japan,' Xu said in the video.</p>

<p>'They are satisfied that he has no financial links with 'foreign forces', was not responsible for any subversive activities [and as a result decided] not to prosecute him.'</p>

<p>An anonymous human right lawyer also confirmed the citizen journalist's current location with the Hong Kong newspaper.</p>

<p>'[Chen] Qiushi, who is together with his parents, is under strict supervision by the authorities,' the lawyer said.</p>

<p>Another unnamed friend of Chen's told the Guardian that they were sure only that Chen was not free.</p>

<p>Fang Bin (pictured), a Wuhan resident, went missing on February 9 after releasing a series of videos, including one showing piles of bodies being loaded into a bus (below)</p>

<p>Li Zehua (pictured) vanished on February 26 before re-appearing at the end of April. Li was likely targeted by secret police after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a report said</p>

<p>Zhang Zhan, (pictured) who uploaded coronavirus reports from Wuhan onto social media to criticise the city's handling of the outbreak, has reportedly been arrested in June</p>

<p>Chen is among the four Chinese citizen journalists who had vanished for publishing reports about Wuhan's epidemic on international social media outlets.</p>

<p>Fang Bin, a businessman, disappeared in early February and is believed to have been taken into state custody. Li Zehua, 25, also went missing in late February before re-appearing in late April.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhan, reportedly to be 40, was allegedly removed by police in June on suspicion of 'picking quarrels and provoking trouble', a broad-brush charge often used against activists.</p>

<p>China has reportedly harassed, threatened and silenced multiple citizens who vowed to hold the government responsible for its perceived missteps in dealing with the new coronavirus outbreak. </p>

<p>Dr Li Wenliang, 34, died of the coronavirus in February after being punished for sounding the alarm over the outbreak. The police accused Dr Li and other medics of spreading fake news</p>

<p>Ren Zhiqiang, a prominent Communist party member who criticised Xi Jinping's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, is  jailed for 18 years this week over corruptionIn charges. In this file photo from 2012, the then real estate mogul is seen in his office in Beijing</p>

<p>Other grieving Wuhan residents were allegedly hassled, intimidated and hushed by authorities after planning to draw up petitions against officials over their response to the health crisis.</p>

<p>Li Wenliang, an eye doctor in Wuhan, was given severe oral warnings by his boss and police officers after sending a message onto social media to warn other medics of a 'SARS-like' disease. The 34-year-old later died of COVID-19 after contracting it from a patient. </p>

<p>Ren Zhiqiang, an outspoken Chinese Communist Party critic and millionaire property tycoon, received a sentence of 18 years for corruption, bribery and embezzlement of public funds after he penned an essay fiercely critical of Xi's response to the outbreak, calling the leader 'a clown'.</p>
