<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>If you've been toying with the idea of investing in some home gym equipment, then we recommend you hotfoot it over to Amazon.</p>

<p>The mega-site is currently offering up to 40 per cent off home gym equipment including rowing machines, treadmills, steppers and exercise bikes. </p>

<p>Included in the deal is an impressive 32 per cent off the HOMCOM Rowing Machine. Reduced down to just £73.49 from £107.99- it's one of the cheapest rowing machines we've seen. </p>

<p>What's more, shoppers have described the rower as 'easy to use' and 'easy to assemble' so you can have it up and running in minutes. Win-win. </p>

<p>The HOMCOM Rowing Machine is now 32 per cent off on Amazon, costing you a wallet-friendly £73.49</p>

<p>As the weather gets colder, many of us are guilty of making excuses for not going to the gym or on that run. A home rowing machine is a savvy solution to winters workout woes. </p>

<p>If you've been put off by the cost and effort of investing and setting up home gym equipment in the past, then like many Amazon shoppers, you're sure to be pleasantly surprised by the HOMCOM Rowing Machine. </p>

<p>At £73.49 it costs less than most gym memberships and measuring 130L x 67.5W x 67H cm it's generally a lot smaller than other rowers so won't take up as much room as you think. </p>

<p>In fact, a lot of the reviews for the HOMCOM Rowing Machine have praised it for its easy assembly.</p>

<p>It's easy assembly may be down to the fact that it's a fairly bog-standard machine. However, while admittedly a lot less technical than some rowing machines, if you're looking for a simple, straight forward machine that will give you a full-body workout and improve your cardiovascular fitness, then this will do the trick. </p>

<p>'Oh my god, what a fab machine to have' one reviewer raved 'easy to assemble and excellent value for money. I'm so happy with my rowing machine.'</p>

<p>Another agreed, writing: 'A little in the small size, its a squeeze for me at 6ft. Despite this, I find it very easy to use. Assembly was minimal, its compact so easy to store, the tensioner is excellent with a definite difference between all 12 tensions. </p>

<p>The seat isn't the best, but I'm going to velcro a copy support pad to it. If you want a simple, compact, lightweight, easy to use, well constructed and cheap row machine then up this one.'</p>

<p>Shoppers care describing the HOMCOM Rowing Machine as 'compact, lightweight, easy to use'</p>

<p>The HOMCOM Rowing Machine is equipped with 12 adjustable levels of resistance to create a smooth and quiet row for different workout levels. </p>

<p>Another key feature of the rower is the multifunction LCD monitor. The small screen displays time, count, calories, total count and scan so you can track your performance and set personal goals. </p>

<p>A huge benefit of a rowing machine is that they are usually substantially cheaper than other home gym equipment like treadmill and bikes. While you can spend close to £1,000 on Olympic standard rowers, if you're not a competitive rower, then the HOMCOM is a solid option.  </p>

<p>Shoppers have called it a 'great buy' and 'well worth the money' with one delighted shopper writing: 'I got exactly what I hoped for, sturdy, straight forward, good exercise machine'. </p>
