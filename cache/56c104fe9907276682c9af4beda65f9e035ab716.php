<p>The sarcophagi have been buried underground for 2,500 years. 13 were initially found earlier this month before a further 14 were uncovered</p>

<p>It is believed the archaeological haul of 27 sarcophagi is the largest of its kind ever</p>

<p>In a statement on Saturday, Egypt's Antiquity Ministry said: 'Initial studies indicate that these coffins are completely closed and haven't been opened since they were buried.'</p>

<p>The find is believed to be the largest of its kind ever and the ministry's statement said that they hoped to reveal 'more secrets' about the discovery soon.</p>

<p>Alongside the wooden sarcophagi, smaller statues and artefacts were also discovered by the archaeological team. </p>

<p>Although having been discovered earlier, the ministry delayed announcing the news until Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Anani could visit the dig site himself to inspect the sarcophagi.</p>

<p>The Saqqara necropolis is found south of Cairo and is part of the ancient capital city of Memphis, a Unesco World Heritage site.</p>

<p>It is also the site of the colossal rectangular-based step Pyramid of Djoser. </p>

<p>The sarcophagi were discovered by a team digging 36ft down and work continues to be carried out to try and work out the exact history of the sarcophagi. </p>

<p>Egypt uses archaeological discoveries as a means to promote tourism, a sector which has been directly affected by travel restrictions put in place in response to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
