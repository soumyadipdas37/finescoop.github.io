<p>Nominated role: Hugh plays Frank Tassone, a corrupt superintendent who hoodwinked Long Island's Roslyn High School, before being sent to prison in 2006 for larceny</p>

<p>In an interview with Variety in April, Hugh described the opportunity to portray the real-life school superintendent as 'fascinating'.    </p>

<p>'The role itself was something different from what I've done. I liked the idea of someone who is super successful, very, very good at what he did, beloved by the community - and fell down this slippery path,' he said. </p>

<p>Hugh also described playing the villain as 'delicious' in an interview with Collider.</p>

<p>'As an actor, it just had so much to play with, and so many things that I've never really had the opportunity to play with. He's seemingly very charming, but also just a viper... Those things, I just found really exciting to play,' he said.  </p>
