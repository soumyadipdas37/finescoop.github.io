<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lizzo has made waves in the entertainment industry not just for her hit songs but also for her message about body acceptance.</p>

<p>But on the October cover of Vogue, the 32-year-old Truth Hurts crooner said that while the body-positivity movement has gained momentum with 'curvier' girls, it has not yet included women who are size 18 and up.</p>

<p>'Girls with back fat, girls with bellies that hang, girls with thighs that aren't separated, that overlap. Girls with stretch marks. You know, girls who are in the 18-plus club,' said the Minneapolis native who was born Melissa Viviane Jefferson. 'They need to be benefiting from... the mainstream effect of body positivity now.'</p>

<p>Time for change: Lizzo told the October cover of Vogue that while the body-positivity movement has gained momentum with 'curvier' girls, it has not yet included women who are size 18 and up</p>

<p>The self-love enthusiast noted that because the body positivity message has gone so mainstream, the message has been lost a bit. But still it is better than nothing.  </p>

<p>'It's commercialized,' said the performer.</p>

<p>'Now, you look at the hashtag "body positive," and you see smaller-framed girls, curvier girls. Lotta white girls,' added the songbird.</p>

<p>More please: 'Girls with back fat, girls with bellies that hang, girls with thighs that aren't separated, that overlap. Girls with stretch marks. You know, girls who are in the 18-plus club,' said the Minneapolis native</p>

<p>But she said she feels 'no ways about that, because inclusivity is what my message is always about.'</p>

<p>Lizzo added: 'I'm glad that this conversation is being included in the mainstream narrative.' </p>

<p>But she feels that women who are size 18 and up are not getting the acceptance they deserve.</p>

<p>'What I don't like is how the people that this term was created for are not benefiting from it. Girls with back fat, girls with bellies that hang, girls with thighs that aren't separated, that overlap. Girls with stretch marks. You know, girls who are in the 18-plus club. They need to be benefiting from...the mainstream effect of body positivity now.'</p>

<p>A need for a wider understanding: The self-love enthusiast noted that because the body positivity message has gone so mainstream, the message has been lost a bit. But still it is better than nothing. 'It's commercialized,' said the performer. 'Now, you look at the hashtag "body positive," and you see smaller-framed girls, curvier girls. Lotta white girls'</p>

<p>Lizzo is savvy enough to note that 'with everything that goes mainstream, it gets changed.' And she knows it's unavoidable: 'It gets—you know, it gets made acceptable.'</p>

<p>And the Hustlers actress feels her fame can cause change.    </p>

<p>'I want to make music that helps. 'Cause that's the way that I help. I'm not a doctor, I'm not a lawyer, I don't work in the government. I make music,' stated the dancer.</p>

<p>She gets it: Lizzo is savvy enough to note that 'with everything that goes mainstream, it gets changed.' And she knows it's unavoidable: 'It gets—you know, it gets made acceptable.' And the Hustlers actress feels her fame can cause change. 'I want to make music that helps'</p>

<p>The chart-topper also touched on police violence: 'They don't actually care. And "they"—I don't know who "they" are. </p>

<p>'But I know that they don't care, because if sh*t like this is still happening, there has to be a "they." They don't care about somebody's actual life.'</p>

<p>And the red carpet favorite added that she is happy that Senator Kamala Harris, 55, has landed the Vice President nomination.</p>

<p>She knows how to look her best: Her red carpet looks are impressive; seen in November 2019</p>

<p>'Having a Black woman as vice president would be great because I'm just always rooting for Black people,' began Lizzo.</p>

<p>She is happy that Senator Kamala Harris, 55, has landed the VP nomination</p>

<p>'But I want actual change to happen…in the laws. And not just on the outside, you know? Not a temporary fix to a deep-rooted, systemic issue. </p>

<p>'A lot of times I feel like we get distracted by the veneer of things. If things appear to be better, but they're not actually better, we lose our sense of protest.'</p>

<p>Most importantly, the star wants her followers to vote.</p>

<p>'I just want to encourage people to register to vote. That is the most important thing to me. Because there's a lot of upset people, and there's a lot of people who have power,' said the Good As Hell crooner.</p>

<p>'There's a lot of voter suppression in Black communities. But there's a lot of angry white kids now. And I'm like, "Yo, register to vote. Go out. You won't get suppressed if you try to go to your ballot box.: You know?</p>

<p>Vote now! During her 73 Questions with Vogue she touched on a number of subjects. The star said she wants to vote 'as quickly as f**king possible,' and is planning to mail in her vote</p>

<p>Awards galore! The stage personality also showed off her many awards and said the one that 'changed my life' was the one from Soul Train</p>

<p>'I think it's important to remind people of what they can do. My job isn't to tell you how to vote. But my job is hopefully to inspire you to vote…to activate you, so that you can take your protest to the ballot box.' </p>

<p>Lizzo was photographed by Hype Williams and interviewed by Claudia Rankine with the Fashion Editor Carlos Nazario.</p>

<p>Hair was by Shelby Swain, makeup by Alexx Mayo as she wore Valentino on the cover with earrings by Jason of Beverly Hills. Rings and bracelets by Chopard and Tiffany &amp; Co (worn throughout). Shoes by Manolo Blahnik. She also had on Gucci. </p>
