<p>Pjanic, who was part of a swap deal which involved Arthur joining his former side Juventus, was delayed arriving in Spain after testing positive for coronavirus in August.</p>

<p>The midfielder will take Arthur's No 8 shirt which has also been worn by club legend Andreas Iniesta. The 30-year-old spoke about his pride at signing for the Catalan club and the importance of club captain Messi remaining at the Nou Camp.</p>

<p>Miralem Pjanic was unveiled as Barcelona's new No 8 after his arrival was delayed by Covid-19</p>

<p>Messi asked to leave earlier this summer, believing he was a free agent, but the club insisted that his £629million release clause was still active.</p>

<p>The forward opted not take his side to court, meaning he can leave on a free transfer next summer - if he wishes.</p>

<p>But new boy Pjanic insisted he can't see him wearing another team's kit after signing a four-year contract with the Catalans.</p>

<p>'Leo has his home here and I can only imagine him here,' said the midfielder.</p>

<p>The 30-year-old spoke of his pride at signing for the Catalans after leaving Juventus </p>

<p>'It would have been strange to see him in another shirt. He's perhaps the best player ever and it's huge to have him alongside us.'</p>

<p>The Bosnia international went on to share his pride at completing his switch to LaLiga.</p>

<p>'It is a great pride for me to be here. I hope to stay here in the years to come and win titles with the club.</p>

<p>'For me, playing is a dream. Being part of this club is something extraordinary. I am very grateful for everything I have done in my career. Today I am in the best team in the world.</p>

<p>'Last season was unfortunate, and the COVID-19. The break was complicated, but there are things that happen in football and we have to look forward. Barca will be great again. Sharing a dressing room with Messi and with everyone is a great opportunity and a dream.'</p>
