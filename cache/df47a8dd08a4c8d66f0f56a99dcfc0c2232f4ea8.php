<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Former England Rugby player and coach Sir Clive Woodward will be kicking off a 'DNA of a Champion' virtual course for small businesses tomorrow.</p>

<p>The sporting legend and seasoned business adviser will teach a live and interactive training programme on team growth and development, designed to combat the current 95 per cent failure rate for tech start-up businesses in the UK. </p>

<p>The classes will run  on the online learning platform Sales Impact Academy - a subscription-based tool for sales and marketing professionals within tech start-up and scale-up companies.</p>

<p>But companies wishing to have employees join the course will need to pay the academy's £500 per month fee for start-ups and £1,000 per month fee for scale-ups. For this they get access to Sir Clive's course and its other live courses, which amount to more than 500 per year.</p>

<p>Sir Clive will run the course in a bid to help combat high failure rates for UK tech start-ups</p>

<p>Sir Clive hopes to tackle the staggering start-up failure statistic by addressing the 'critical knowledge crisis' currently affecting those in market and sales roles in tech companies worldwide. </p>

<p>Using his own experience as a formidable leader during his time as a player and a coach he promises to share how he supercharged his performance during both times with course participants. </p>

<p>It is argued that the skills he aims to share – whether applied to sports, marketing or sales – have proven effective in achieving maximum impact in any field.</p>

<p>The course, which starts on 8 September, is made up of six in-depth classes which will take a deep dive into the key characteristics of high performing teams and individuals, underpinned by tools and techniques to put these into practice. </p>

<p>Course topics will touch on why talent alone is not enough, the importance of being a 'sponge', how to build that winning mindset and culture, and the key to tackling change.  </p>

<p>Sir Clive said: 'We all have talent, we all have raw skill. That's not to say we can all be Olympic champions – but we can all achieve our goals if we know where to start from and where to aim for.</p>

<p>'Especially in this time of crisis, this course will help teams in the tech community realise their full potential and maximise their output.' </p>

<p>The Sales Impact Academy played a significant role in supporting the industry through the coronavirus crisis by offering free access to its services to any company or individual from April to May.</p>

<p>It also extended this access to anyone that was unemployed through to July.  </p>

<p>The 'DNA of a Champion' course adds to the 500 plus classes a year already on offer from Sales Impact Academy and businesses can access it by subscribing to the platform.</p>

<p>But the courses come at what may seem a steep price for many small firms. The cost is £500 per month for start-ups and £1,000 per month for scale-ups. Benefits include unlimited access to hundreds of live classes, a resources library and access to the community.   </p>

<p>Paul Fifield, chief executive and co-founder of Sales Impact Academy, said: 'We are very excited to have one on the best sporting minds in the country share his invaluable advice for being a leader under pressure. </p>

<p>'Learning from Sir Clive and putting his approaches to team building, performance and leadership into practice will help any company to survive and thrive'.</p>
