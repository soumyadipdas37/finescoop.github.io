<p>The Red Hill Hotel in Melbourne dates back 165 years and has introduced the huge chicken nugget doughnut to the menu</p>

<p>The 'donug' is best served with hot chips and a cold beer, and customers can choose between three different toppings including cheese, curry or chilli.</p>

<p>Customers on social media shared their excitement and seemed very eager to try the chicken doughnut for themselves.</p>

<p>'That is amazing!' one woman said, and another man added: 'Awesome! Looks so good!' </p>

<p>Married couple Crag Carrick and his chef wife Rachel Dutton started selling the unique hybrid food in 2018 after launching their business and appeared on Shark Tank. </p>

<p>The Melbourne couple sealed a $100,000 deal after pitching their culinary idea.</p>

<p>'I'm not changing the world with this product. I'm giving something that's fun, it's easy to understand, people get it straight away,' Mr Carrick explained to the judging panel. </p>

<p>Crag Carrick and his wife Rachel Dutton launched a start-up business selling the Donug</p>

<p>Ms Dutton is the chef behind the business - combining the two humble fast foods together</p>

<p>The fried finger food called Donugs is a cross between a chicken nugget and a doughnut</p>

<p>'Nothing's sweet about it. All savoury product. It's 98 per cent chicken that has our unique and top-secret spice mix that goes through it,' Mr Carrick explained. </p>

<p>'It's got then a cornflakes and panko crumb and three different sauces - a cheesy dijon bechamel, a golden Japanese curry and mozzarella, a hot chilli, or you can have it just on its own.' </p>

<p>After seeing quirky food trends sweeping social media from Japan and LA, Mr Carrick said he wanted to create something crazy too.</p>

<p>Donugs are made from free range chicken, coated with crispy cornflakes and panko crumb</p>

<p> RedBalloon founder Naomi Simson offered the pair $100,000 for 25 per cent of the business</p>

<p>'I want this to be the crazy new food trend coming out of Melbourne,' he said.</p>

<p>Would you try a Donug?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>And so he teamed up with his chef wife, who has been in the food industry for 15 years, to whip up a combination of the two humble fast foods.</p>

<p>'It's made with care, it's a chef's recipe,' Mr Carrick added.</p>

<p>Besides the delicious taste, the investors were far more impressed with the numbers.</p>

<p>Donugs sell for $9 a pop but cost just a measly $2.20 to make - but the figure will rise to $4 at production cost - that's still a 225 per cent return and a 125 per cent profit. </p>
