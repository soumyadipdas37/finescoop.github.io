<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Britain will enjoy temperatures of 75F (24C) this week as a hot air plume from the continent sends the mercury soaring - with betting agents cutting the odds for an Indian summer later in the month. </p>

<p>Temperatures are expected to stay in the mid-70s this week - before potentially rising into the 80s after the weekend.  </p>

<p>Bookmakers Coral have cut odds on temperatures reaching 86F (30C) to 5/4. Coral spokesman John Hill said: 'School's back but the sun's out and punters believe Britain will bake.'</p>

<p>Four years ago an Indian summer saw temperatures in Britain hit 93F (34.4.C) on September 13 and a decade ago, in 2011, the mercury reached 85F (29.9C) in October. </p>

<p>The south and midlands will be warm and dry while the north could see 72.6F (22C) but is due cloudier and showery days. </p>

<p>Nicola Maxey, Met Office forecaster, told MailOnline: ‘There's certainly high pressure building which would indicate an increase in temperature towards the end of the week. </p>

<p>'We're going to see mid-20s to the south east and that is coming from the continent. We’re likely to see warmer conditions over the weekend, with temperatures into the mid-20s.   </p>

<p>'By Saturday London could see anything from 21-23C. For Sunday temperatures will reach 24C but they could creep above to 25/26C. This is tropical night time air pushing up from the south.</p>

<p>'There is some warmer air coming from the continent but there's no indication it's going to hang around for a long period. </p>

<p>'For the south east we’re looking at a warm weekend with some dry sunny spells for the southeast. For the west and the north we’ve got rain and drizzle.' </p>

<p>Hundreds of people arrived to Mudeford in Dorset yesterday as warmer spells began to make their way across the country again</p>

<p>The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: 'The upper-20s are possible, with even 30C not out of the question amid Indian Summer-style autumn warmth.</p>

<p>'Computer models show a big ramp-up in temperatures at the weekend.'</p>

<p>MetDesk said: 'There are tantalising signs of summery weather later this weekend and next week.'</p>

<p>With a scorching few weeks ahead, the bookies have cut odds from 5/1 to just 6/4 that 86F (30C) or higher is recorded anywhere in the UK before the end of September.</p>

<p>Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: 'We're strapping ourselves in for a scorching September and there's every chance we even see 30C temperatures before the month is out.'  </p>

<p>The UK could bask in higher temperatures once more as a 'subtropical swell' of warm air moves from the Atlantic and brings with it rising mercury levels.</p>

<p>Following a dreary start to the week which saw showers across most of England and Wales and mist and fog patches across the south, the country could once again be met with sunny spells and highs of 77F as we move into autumn.  </p>

<p>Met Office forecaster Mark Wilson said: 'After above-average highs around 24C, temperatures ease although there will be lots of sunshine.</p>

<p>'Then it looks like definitely turning warmer again from Sunday with temperatures in the low and possibly mid-20s, with signals it could turn very warm.</p>

<p>'Air will come from the continent, with decent sunny periods. There is still uncertainty about how warm it will be.'   </p>

<p>The country saw a north-south divide yesterday as outbreaks of rain persisted across the northwest regions and much of Scotland and Northern Ireland remained dry with sunny spells.</p>

<p>A Met Office spokesperson told MailOnline: 'Tuesday is going to be fairly cloudy, there will be outbreaks of rain from the west and further east there will be a greater chance of sunshine. </p>

<p>'Temperatures will be a little higher from Monday so we could be looking at 24C possibly 25C. Later on we are going to have some further wet weather that is going to push in particularly into norhtwestern parts from Tuesday night into Wednesday.' </p>

<p>Last weekend drivers were warned they would be left facing traffic chaos over the Bank Holiday weekend after 18 million cars took to the roads for a last chance to enjoy a staycation.  </p>
