<p>Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was spotted out on his bike again on Monday in Santa Monica, California, looking authoritative in a dark blue sheriff baseball cap.  </p>

<p>He is back: Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger was spotted out on his bike again on Monday in Santa Monica, looking authoritative in a dark blue sheriff baseball cap</p>

<p>Arnold also wore black slip on shoes.</p>

<p>The father-of-five is often seen cruising the streets of Venice and Santa Monica on his electric bike, often with at least one of his children.   </p>

<p>Earlier this month, the Governator was seen biking with his youngest son Joseph Baena, 22. </p>

<p>Joseph has previously been referred to as Arnie's 'love child', as he is the formerly secret son of the septuagenarian film star and Mildred Baena, who at the time of her pregnancy was working as the family's maid.</p>

<p>Joseph is only five days younger than Schwarzenegger's son Christopher, also 22, whom Arnold shares with ex-wife Maria Shriver.</p>

<p>While Joseph was born on October 2, 1997, Christopher was born on September 27.</p>

<p>And while the bombshell development, confirmed in 2011 by Maria, eventually led to the couple's divorce finalized in 2017, it seems that most of that family drama is now water under the bridge.</p>

<p>Arnold has been seen as the family man in many instances, whether it is celebrating his son Christopher's graduation from college alongside Maria, 64, earlier this year, or feting older son Patrick's 27th birthday last week.</p>

<p>And of course, another big family moment occurred for Arnold along with the whole Schwarzenegger clan this summer – he became a grandfather for the first time, with the birth of little Lyla Maria Pratt to his daughter Katherine and her husband, actor Chris Pratt.</p>
