<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Catholic Cardinal George Pell is on his way to the Vatican for the first time in three years, six months after he was cleared of child sex abuse charges in Australia. </p>

<p>He boarded a Qatar plane bound for Rome which departed from Sydney International Airport on one of the last flights departing on Tuesday night.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pell, 79, was spotted in the airport lounge waiting to board, where he appeared to be travelling alone and was wearing a full-face protective shield.</p>

<p>It's understood NSW Police officers escorted Pell through the airport terminal via a lower ground entrance different to the one used by the public to avoid the waiting media, Nine News reported. </p>

<p>The 16 hour flight is scheduled to arrive in Rome later on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Cardinal George Pell (pictured in the terminal lounge wearing a full face protective shield) was whisked through a private entrance at Sydney Airport to avoid the waiting media</p>

<p>The reason for his trip to the Vatican is unknown. </p>

<p>Archdiocese of Sydney adviser Katrina Lee told AFP on Tuesday he was travelling to Rome in a 'private' capacity but declined to comment on the purpose of his trip.</p>

<p>'He always said he would be going back to Rome at some stage,' she said. </p>

<p>His return to Rome comes just days after Vatican cardinal Giovanni Becciu resigned over embezzlement claims, having lost the trust of Pope Francis.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pell supports the move by Pope Francis, despite Cardinal Becciu denying any wrongdoing.</p>

<p>'The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances,' Cardinal Pell told the Catholic News Agency last week.</p>

<p>'He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments.'</p>

<p>Cardinal Pell returned to Australia in mid-2017 to fight charges related to the sexual assault of two choirboys when he was Archbishop of Melbourne in the late 1990s.</p>

<p>He was convicted in December 2018 and served just over a year of a six-year jail sentence before the High Court of Australia overturned the conviction earlier this year.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pell has been living in Sydney since his release from jail in April.</p>

<p>In the three years prior to his return to Australia in mid-2017, Cardinal Pell headed up the Vatican's Secretariat of the Economy, tasked with cleaning up the church's vast finances and eliminating abuse.</p>

<p>Under current coronavirus travel restrictions, Australians are banned from leaving the country except for official business or compassionate personal reasons.</p>

<p>It was not immediately clear under what circumstances Pell would have been granted an exception from the travel ban.</p>
