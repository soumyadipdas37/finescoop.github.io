<p>Jonny was out on his BMX bike in Syracuse, New York, on September 26 when he noticed a tiny bird fly straight into a fire department water pipe on the side of a building</p>

<p>But much to his surprise, the bird immediately flies out of the pipe and launches itself at his face, the video shows.</p>

<p>Johnny stumbles backwards in shock after the bird's unexpectedly swift movement, hysterically laughing as he cannot quite believe what happened.</p>

<p>Jonny was given an unexpected fright when the bird flew out of its nesting place and launched itself at his face, startling video footage shows</p>

<p>The bird was nesting inside a fire department connection, which is used by firefighters to provide water to a building's sprinkler system in case of a fire</p>

<p>The important water pipe is connected to the building's automatic fire sprinkler system and can be used by firefighters to connect hose lines in case of a fire.</p>

<p>The fire department are then able to pump water into the sprinkler system at a high pressure to put out the fire.</p>

<p>The amusing footage was shared on YouTube, where one viewer poked fun at Jonny, saying that 'he clearly knew something was in there'.</p>

<p>Speaking about the footage, Jonny said: 'I bmx a lot and on my travels today, I happened to see a bird fly right into the pipe on the side of a building and when I went to go investigate, it popped out and startled me.'Â </p>
