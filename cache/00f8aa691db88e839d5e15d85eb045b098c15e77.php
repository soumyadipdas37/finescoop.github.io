<p>Researchers in Argentina found that exposing bees to foods scented with synthetic sunflower odour made them find and pollinate sunflowers.  </p>

<p>Prior exposure to the scent of sunflower created 'bee memories' that influenced them to find the sunflowers and bring back more sunflower pollen to their hive. </p>

<p>The discovery could have a global impact on increasing not only flowers yields, but also food crops like almonds, apples and pears.   </p>

<p>'We show that it's possible to condition honeybees to a rewarded odour inside the colony, and this experience modifies the bees' odour-guided behaviours later,' said Dr Walter Farina of Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina. </p>

<p>'The most surprising and relevant result is that the foraging preferences for the target crop are so prolonged and intensive that it promoted significant increases in the crop yields.'</p>

<p>The growing global demand for pollination leads producers to consider new strategies in pollinator management, Dr Farina claims.</p>

<p>Training bees like dogs may be the answer if bee keepers want to pick and choose what type of crop they'll pollinate.   </p>

<p>Trained bees clustered on a sunflower. Floral cues learned inside the colony improve honey bee foraging activity</p>

<p>Bees generally can learn scents inside the nest, when scented food from successful foragers is unloaded and distributed among nest mates, for example. </p>

<p>'Such social learning is key for adaptive collective responses, as it enables workers to acquire information about different foraging options,' the researchers say.  </p>

<p>To demonstrate bee memories and their response to training, the scientists selected sunflower – an economically important and pollinator-dependent crop. </p>

<p>Researchers developed a simple synthetic mixture that the bees associated with the natural floral scent of sunflowers and combined this with bee food – in this case, a simple sucrose solution. </p>

<p>Honey bee colonies were fed 1,000ml of the scented sucrose solution, placed in their hives for two days and then released.  </p>

<p>The man-made hives were lined up along a field of sunflower crops.  </p>

<p>The bees' training led them to visit sunflowers more and, in turn, bring more sunflower pollen back to the hive. </p>

<p>This increased visitation and foraging on sunflowers also boosted flower production by 29 to 57 percent.  </p>

<p>The bees' foraging preferences were also indicated by their 'waggle dances'. </p>

<p>Honeybees use waggle dances to recruit nest mates to food sources – a signal that provides information about the location of profitable foraging sites. </p>

<p>The results highlight the role of olfactory learning within the social context of the hive to bias foraging preferences. </p>

<p>'Through this procedure, it is possible to bias honeybee foraging activity and increase yields significantly,' Dr Farina said. </p>

<p>'In other words, pollination services might be improved in pollinator-dependent crops by using simple mimic odors as part of a precision pollination strategy.'</p>

<p>Dr Farina's team had previously shown that honeybees could establish stable and long-term memory related to food scents inside the nest. </p>

<p>They also knew that those in-hive memories could influence the bees' choices about which plants to visit later. </p>

<p>The researchers say they are now studying other pollinator-dependent crops, including almonds, pears, and apples. </p>

<p>Ultimately, their goal is to develop an array of odour mimics to improve pollination efficiency of important agricultural crops.</p>

<p>The research has been published in the journal Current Biology.   </p>
