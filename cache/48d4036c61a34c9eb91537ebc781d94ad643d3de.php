<p>Short-lived: The relationship comes eight months following her 12-day marriage to Hollywood producer Jon Peters</p>

<p>In an interview with the New York Times following the marriage, Pamela insisted she wasn't married. </p>

<p>'There was no wedding, there was no marriage, there was no anything.'</p>

<p>Despite her checkered history with marriage, the Baywatch babe declared she was keen to tie the knot again.   </p>

<p>'Just one more time, please, God. One more time only,' she declared.</p>

<p>Former flame: Anderson was married to rocker Tommy Lee from 1995 to 1998</p>

<p>Pamela described what happened with Jon as 'just kind of a little moment.'</p>

<p>'I was in India and I went to this panchakarma cleanse, and I'd been gone for three weeks in this ayurvedic center, meditating, just so clear,' the pinup explained.</p>

<p>'I came back and VWOOM, within 24 hours, I saw Jon. It was like this little whirlwind thing, and it was over really quick, and it was nothing. Nothing physical. It's just a friendship,' she said.</p>

<p>Happier times: She was also married to poker player Rick Salomon from 2007 to 2008</p>

<p>The duo had known each other for 30 years prior to their marriage, and Pamela said there were 'no hearts were broken' during their 'moment'.</p>

<p>The marriage ended amid allegations Pamela ended the marriage after Jon paid off nearly $200k of her debt, while other sources accused the producer of attempting to 'control' her career, according to Page Six. </p>

<p>Both parties have denied these allegations.  </p>

<p>Including her union with Jon, Pamela has been married a total of four times. </p>

<p>She was married to Tommy Lee from 1995 to 1998, Kid Rock from 2006 to 2007, and Rick Salomon from 2007 to 2008. </p>
