<p>The Sun reported The One Kiss hitmaker has relocated stateside to live with her partner due to fears that she won't be able to travel to and fro because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Surprise! Her outing comes hours after her boyfriend Anwar Hadid became an uncle, following news his sister Gigi had given birth to a baby girl with boyfriend Zayn Malik </p>

<p>Simple: The No Rules hitmaker opted for a cream shirt that hung loosely over her figure, though was partially open to show a glimpse of her tummy</p>

<p>Low-key: Dua teamed it with classic black trousers and trainers, along with an array of other bags, and finished the outfit with a padded bodywarmer</p>

<p>It was claimed the London-born artist has moved into a lavish property in Beverly Hills near to Anwar's family, despite the fact that her inner circle are all based in the UK. </p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'It was difficult to get to the US in the first place and she knows it's not going to be easy going back and forth because she would have to quarantine for weeks on end.</p>

<p>'But she knows plenty of people in Los Angeles, as does Anwar, who has lived there in the past, so she's feeling optimistic.</p>

<p>'Being in the US right now is great for pushing her career there too, especially with new music coming out. Dua's making their new place nice and homely and she has just got a puppy called Dexter with Anwar because they see their future in LA.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted representatives for Dua and Anwar for comment at the time. </p>

<p>New home? It was reported last week that Dua has upped sticks and travelled across the pond to Los Angeles to be closer to California native Anwar</p>
