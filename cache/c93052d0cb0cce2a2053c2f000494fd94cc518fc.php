<p>Open and honest: Her gushing profession comes after Tamzin insisted that she is 'not having a midlife crisis' by dating a toyboy 21 years her junior. She said her relationship with personal trainer Tom is both 'unexpected and magic'</p>

<p>But the soap star also revealed that some people think she is having a midlife crisis due to the substantial age gap. 'People think I’m having a midlife crisis, but actually, not all men want a younger woman,' she told Prima magazine.</p>

<p>'There’s Joan Collins, Sam Taylor-Johnson and Helena [Bonham-Carter] with younger men, so I'm in really lovely company.</p>

<p>'Tom’s very good for my mental and physical health. The other way around, no one says anything about a younger woman do they?' </p>

<p>She was previously married to ex-EastEnders actor Tom Ellis, but they divorced in 2014. The pair have two daughters, Flo, 11, and seven-year-old Marnie.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that ex Tom cheated on her with Australian actress, Emilie de Ravin, in 2013 as they filmed for the TV series Once Upon A Time while in America.</p>

<p>But since their split, the actress says she has stopped 'giving two hoots' about what other people think of her, describing it as 'a lovely feeling'.</p>
