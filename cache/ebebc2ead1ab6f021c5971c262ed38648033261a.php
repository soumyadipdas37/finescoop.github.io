<p>The Real Housewives of Potomac star, 36, opened up to The Daily Dish podcast Tuesday about the rumor mill, which involved Gizelle Bryant, Candiace Dillard and show alum Charrisse Jackson Jordan.</p>

<p>The latest: Monique Samuels, 36, said that 'children are off limits' in response to rumors that her husband Chris is not the biological father of their toddler son Chase</p>

<p>Bryant, 50, said that another rumor was that Samuels and her trainer were spending time together and her spouse caught wind of it.</p>

<p>Samuels told the podcast that Bryant 'was taking a shot because that's what she wanted to bring on the show - another lie.'</p>

<p>She added that Bryant 'realized that if she went that deep off into, who would look terrible? Her. Children are off limits. We will deal with this at the reunion.'</p>

<p>Samuels said that Bryant 'just created' the rumor in taking 'the same situation' and putting her own 'spin on it.'</p>

<p>The Pleasantville, New Jersey-born reality star on Tuesday's podcast said that a former friend and Jackson Jordan were saying she had 'an affair with [her] trainer and [her] pregnancy was not with Chris' in regards to their son Chase, who turns two in November</p>

<p>Of her physical clash with Dillard, Samuels said the while she wished 'none of it ever happened,' it 'was something that was based off of energy being returned'</p>

<p>She referenced an earlier remark Bryant made in proclaiming her ex-husband Jamal Bryant 'the actual father of my kids.'</p>

<p>Samuels said Dillard, 33, compounded the uncomfortable situation in inviting Jackson Jordan, 55, to an anniversary party.</p>

<p>'The situation with Charrisse is not an issue of, "Oh she brought her around and I didn't know they were friends,"' Samuels said. 'Charrisse had been involved in helping facilitate some very nasty stuff about me ... so when Candiace then brought her around on camera, that to me was signaling like "Woah, you're being messy and you already know what she's capable of."'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I was like, "I thought we were supposed to be friends." We had just had a conversation about all of this, so for her to act like she doesn't know why I'm upset with Charrisse, I was baffled.'</p>

<p>Samuels told the podcast that Gizelle Bryant 'was taking a shot because that's what she wanted to bring on the show - another lie'</p>

<p>Looking back: Samuels took to Twitter earlier this week to address her on-goings </p>

<p>Samuels note that Dillard had previously touched on her family situation amid an Instagram Live session with Bryant and Robyn Dixon.</p>

<p>Of her physical clash with Dillard, Samuels said the while she wished 'none of it ever happened,' it 'was something that was based off of energy being returned.</p>

<p>'I just want the fans to know that this wasn't something that was premeditated ... and it just turned into something just very ugly,' Samuels said.</p>

<p>Real Housewives of Potomac airs at 9/8c on Sunday on Bravo.</p>
