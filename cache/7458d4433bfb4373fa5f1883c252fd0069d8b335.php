<p>'We just became friends. It's one of the reasons I think our relationship has always been so good,' he told E! in 2017. 'We were friends for a good two years before we ever went on a date. She knew what kind of guy I was, she knew what my morals were, my priorities were, and vice versa.'</p>

<p>Though they were opposites, Freddie said that ended up working to their favor.</p>

<p>'Neither one of us would have ever - if you ask her, she would have been like, "Oh my God, I thought he was a dork." And I'd be like, "Oh my gosh, she just ran a million miles an hour and I couldn't keep up with her."</p>

<p>'We ended up being the perfect balance, you know what I mean? But it didn't happen until years after, and there was a solid foundation built, and that's probably the main reason why we've always been cool and grooving.'</p>
