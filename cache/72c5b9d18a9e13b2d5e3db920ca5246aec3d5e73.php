<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A glamorous PE teacher will spend at least two years behind bars after she was caught sending sexually explicit messages to a 14-year-old boy.</p>

<p>Katie Smith, 28, from NSW's Hunter Region befriended the student on Snapchat in Term 4 of 2018 and the pair continued to meet up into Term 1 of the following year.</p>

<p>Smith and the teenager kissed and fondled each other on two separate occasions in the school store room and another time in a carpark.</p>

<p>Upon appearing at the Newcastle District Court on Friday, the teacher broke down in tears as she was sentenced to three years and ten months jail.</p>

<p>Katie Smith, 28, from NSW's Hunter region has been jailed for at least two years after having a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student</p>

<p>The PE teacher befriended the student on Snapchat and had sent him explicit messages during 2018 and 2019</p>

<p>She was given a non-parole period of two years and three months, The Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>The court heard Smith had not wanted to have sex with the student but craved attention due to issues she was facing with her husband.</p>

<p>She claimed she just 'wanted to be told I was pretty' and would always 'do anything and everything to get attention'.</p>

<p>Smith was found to have sent the teenager pictures of her breasts as well as a video of her rubbing her genitals. The student sent her photos of his erect penis.  </p>

<p>The relationship between the pair eventually came to an end when Smith learnt about explicit photos of her circulating around the school.</p>

<p>The student told his mother who then called police leading to Smith's arrest.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to grooming a child for unlawful sexual activity, indecent assault of a person under 16 and intentionally sexually touching a child between 10 and 16. </p>

<p>The Newcastle District Court heard Smith just 'wanted to be told I was pretty' and had always 'would do anything and everything to get attention'</p>

<p>Smith admitted she had been caught up in a range of online sexual encounters as she attempted to seek validation.  </p>

<p>She also had suffered from eating issues and had a fixation with her appearance, sometimes crying when looking at herself in the mirror.</p>

<p>Judge Kara Shead accepted the teacher had a borderline personality disorder and was seeking therapy, but said this did not reduce her moral culpability. </p>

<p>The judge noted the 'absolute prohibition on sexual activity with a child' and the serious breach of trust involved in Smith's conduct.</p>

<p>She had preyed on the victim and exploited his vulnerability. </p>

<p>Courts must send 'a stern message' that sexual crimes against children, particularly by teachers, is unacceptable, the judge said.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to grooming a child for unlawful sexual activity</p>
