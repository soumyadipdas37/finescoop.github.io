<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Premier League have released a statement on Thursday reaffirming their desires for supporters to return safely to grounds from October 1.</p>

<p>The government are desperately trying to stop a second wave of coronavirus and Premier League clubs fear that games could be played behind closed doors until November.</p>

<p>Along with football, other major sports have voiced their concerns over when they will be able to get spectators safely back inside grounds, with the initially planned return date of October 1 looking more unlikely as the days go by. </p>

<p>A limited number of fans attended Brighton's home pre-season friendly clash against Chelsea</p>

<p>But on Thursday evening, the Premier League released the following statement, claiming the continued loss of matchday revenue is hugely harming football finances.</p>

<p>The statement read: 'The Premier League and its clubs met today to discuss the return of supporters to stadiums.</p>

<p>'Safety remains the number one priority and clubs reiterated their commitment to ensuring Premier League stadiums will be among the safest public places, through the effective use of a wide range of mitigation measures. </p>

<p>Clubs will adopt a range of common standards, which will help deliver bio-secure, safe environments for fans across the League.</p>

<p>'Clubs reaffirmed that the continued loss of matchday revenues is having a significant impact across the League as well as on the football pyramid and local and national economies.</p>

<p>'Taking into account the high safety standards which will be set by the Premier League in conjunction with the relevant public authorities, the League and clubs urge Government to remain committed to the 1 October date for the controlled return of fans to sporting venues.'</p>

<p>In recent weeks coronavirus cases have been on an alarming rise in the UK, which will see Prime Minister Boris Johnson impose tighter restrictions in a bid to prevent a second wave.</p>

<p>The PM faced a welter of criticism as he begged the public to keep faith with his draconian new rules despite the testing system descending into a shambles, with fears schools and offices will have to shut because people with mild symptoms cannot prove they are negative.</p>

<p>Sports governing bodies believe a November return at the earliest is more likely, with clubs looking to move towards 30 per cent capacity.</p>

<p>Up to 1,000 fans will be allowed at eight fixtures across the three divisions of the EFL, including the Championship matches at Middlesbrough and Norwich, on Saturday afternoon – a decision which has caused backlash among supporters as they fear for their safety and well-being.</p>

<p>EFL chairman Rick Parry, who said EFL clubs are losing £25million a month while fans aren't allowed in stadiums over Covid-19 concerns, believes these trial events in football can 'show the nation the way forward.'</p>

<p>He told Today on BBC Radio 4: 'It's entirely compatible with the rule of six. I think the government has a challenge in explaining all of the rules simply.</p>

<p>'The government wants people to return to work, children to return to schools, students are returning to universities in huge numbers.</p>

<p>'We understand completely the rule of six but in terms of the social distancing within stadiums it's entirely compatible with the rule of six. Given we're the most regulated industry in the country when it comes to managing large events we can be an exemplar.</p>

<p>'As we look for positive solutions amid the coronavirus crisis we can set examples of a return to a degree of normality safely and with social distancing in place.' </p>
