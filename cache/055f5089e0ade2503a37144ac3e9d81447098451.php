<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thousands of frustrated Melburnians have vowed to leave a pair of boots outside their homes in a mass protest demanding Premier Daniel Andrews step down.</p>

<p>The movement, Give Dan The Boot, is set to take place on Sunday with more than 3,000 people already vowing to take part.</p>

<p>The at-home protest is the brainchild of the group Victoria Forward, which is ran by 19-year-old Donald Trump supporter and Liberal member Edward Bourke.</p>

<p>It comes after anti-lockdown protests erupted across the country over the weekend, with 17 arrested in Melbourne and 160 fines issued.</p>

<p>One man has already placed his boots outside his home in the movement Give Dan The Boot</p>

<p>More than 3,000 Melburnians have said they would take part at the at-home protest on Sunday</p>

<p>'It's time to stand up to Daniel Andrews, and now you can do it from home!' the Facebook event reads. </p>

<p>'Please place a pair of boots or shoes at your front gate or around your fence this Sunday, 13th of September and post a photo to this event or use the tag #GiveDanTheBoot.</p>

<p>'GIVE DAN THE BOOT is a silent protest but the image of thousands of boots outside the gates of Victorian households, will decisively convey that the Victorian people have no faith in the premier.'</p>

<p>The group also highlighted due to the protest being carried out at home, no COVID-19 restrictions would be breached.</p>

<p>The page has been flooded with members criticising the premier's strict lockdown, which has been extended by another two weeks.</p>

<p>One Melbourne resident shared a homemade sign she had made with the words #GiveDanTheBoot painted across a piece of cardboard</p>

<p>On Saturday thousands of Melburnians took to the streets demanding an end to lockdown</p>

<p>Victoria Forward frequently posts content urging Mr Andrews to resign and slamming his policies. Pictured: Edward Bourke</p>

<p>One man decided to put his boots out early asking what he did 'to deserve' having Mr Andrews as his premier.</p>

<p>Another shared a homemade sign she had made with the words #GiveDanTheBoot painted across a piece of cardboard.</p>

<p>One woman who doesn't even live in the coronavirus-riddled state said she too would hang out her shoes in support.</p>

<p>Mr Bourke's group Victoria Forward is well known for its highly critical stance on Mr Andrews.</p>

<p>In one social media post, the group insisted that 72 per cent of their 15,000-strong following wanted Mr Andrews to resign. </p>

<p>Mr Bourke first rose to fame following a video interview with VICE Australia in 2016, where the then-15-year-old revealed his support of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>He also runs a government relations firm called 470 Bourke, where the teenager calls himself a 'seasoned political campaigner, activist, and strategist who has a history of success in his political predictions, comments and strategies'.</p>

<p>When Mr Bourke was 14 he started non-profit campaigns before taking on 'successful global political campaigns'. </p>

<p>Protests erupted at the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne with residents demanding an end to the harsh lockdown</p>

<p>The frustration comes after Mr Andrews revealed Melbourne's roadmap out of lockdown.</p>

<p>Currently Melburnians are in the midst of tough Stage Four restrictions which mean residents can only leave their house for four essential reasons - which as gutted local businesses and wreaked havoc on the economy.</p>

<p>These include for one hour of exercise a day, to give or receive care, for work or study and for necessary shopping.</p>

<p>There is also a 8pm-5am curfew enforced.</p>

<p>Announcing how restrictions would be eased on Sunday, Mr Andrews said the lockdown would be extended for another two weeks instead of ending on September 13.</p>

<p>The curfew will also be enforced until October 26 but will be increased to 9pm-5am. </p>

<p>Cafes, bars and restaurants will not be able to have customers dine outside until October 26, as long as the statewide case average has fallen under five for the previous fortnight.</p>

<p>Customers won't be allowed inside until November 23 and only if there have been no cases at all for the previous two weeks.  </p>
