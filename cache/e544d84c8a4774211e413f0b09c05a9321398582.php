<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More evidence has emerged that wearing masks can prevent an infected person from spreading the novel coronavirus to others.</p>

<p>A new study found that homemade cotton face coverings stop 99.9 percent of contagious droplets from spraying into the air when someone coughs or speaks - and surgical masks prevented 100 percent of droplets.</p>

<p>Tests showed a person standing six feet away from someone without a mask was up to 1,000 times greater risk of inhaling droplets than someone standing 1.5 feet away from a coughing person wearing a mask. </p>

<p>What's more, even the homemade single-layer cotton mask reduced the number of infectious droplets by more than 1,000-fold.</p>

<p>The team, from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute in the UK, says the findings show the importance of wearing a face covering in public so that, if you are infected with COVID-19, you are not sickening others.</p>

<p>Researchers looked at the effect of surgical masks and homemade single-layer cotton face coverings. A person standing 6ft away from someone without a mask was up to 1,000 times greater risk of inhaling droplets than 1.5ft away from someone with a mask (above)</p>

<p>Homemade cotton masks reduced the number of infectious droplets by more 99.9% (right) but surgical masks let zero droplets escape into the air (center) compared to no mask (left)</p>

<p>'We knew face masks of various materials are effective to a different extent in filtering small droplets,' said lead researcher Dr Ignazio Maria Viola, a reader at the University of Edinburgh's School of Engineering.</p>

<p>'However, when we looked specifically at those larger droplets that are thought to be the most dangerous we discovered that even the simplest handmade single-layer cotton mask is tremendously effective.'</p>

<p>For the study, published on preprint server medRxiv.org, the team looked at two types of masks: surgical masks and single-layer cotton masks.</p>

<p>Researchers ran two types of simulations. The first was with a mannequin ejecting fluorescent droplets and the second was with human volunteers in speaking and coughing conditions.</p>

<p>They used laser sheet illumination to quantify the number of droplets in the air and a UV light for those that landed on a surface. </p>

<p>When the mannequin wore either of the two face masks, fewer than one in 1,000 particles escaped from either speaking or coughing. </p>

<p>When the six volunteers spoke and coughed, between dozens and thousands of particles were sprayed into the air without a mask.</p>

<p>The surgical mask was a little more effective than the homemade mask because it let zero particles escape into the air.   </p>

<p>The study only looked at large respiratory droplets and not aerosols, which are tiny particles measuring less than five micrometers - smaller than a particle of pollen.</p>

<p>These particles can stay in the air for hours as opposed to the larger particles that land on a surface within a few seconds.  </p>

<p>'If aerosol transmission is later determined to be a significant driver of infection, then our findings may overestimate the effectiveness of face coverings,' the team wrote.</p>

<p>'The simple message from our research is that face masks work,' said Dr Paul Digard, the Chair of Virology at the University of Edinburgh</p>

<p>'Wearing a face covering will reduce the probability that someone unknowingly infected with the virus will pass it on.' </p>

<p>Several reports have found that various types of masks can prevent droplets from entering the respiratory system.</p>

<p>One study found that droplets between 20 to 500 micrometers expelled by someone talking were blocked when the mouth was covered by a washcloth.</p>

<p>Another showed wearing an N99 was the most effective at reducing coronavirus risk while using a cotton T-shirt or a neck gaiter as a cover-up barely provided any barrier. </p>
