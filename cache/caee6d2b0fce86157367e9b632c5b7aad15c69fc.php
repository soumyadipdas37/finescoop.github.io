<p>The 10-second footage, which has been removed from the diplomat's Twitter feed, shows a woman performing a sex act on a man using her feet.</p>

<p>The Chinese Embassy in the UK claimed that the ambassador's account had been hacked and called the move 'despicable'.</p>

<p>Beijing's top man to Britain, 64-year-old Liu Xiaoming (pictured on February 6), has been humiliated after his official Twitter account 'liked' X-rated pornographic content</p>

<p>The 10-second footage, which has been removed from the diplomat's Twitter feed, shows a woman performing a sex act on a man using her feet. The video was first uploaded last May </p>

<p>Beijing's top man to Britain, 64-year-old Liu Xiaoming, is known for defending his country's treatment of Hong Kong protesters and Uighur Muslims.</p>

<p>His endorsement of the explicit video was flagged by Twitter user Luke de Pulford, who shared a screenshot of Mr Liu's 'likes' feed on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Mr Pulford, a member of the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, said that he 'felt a bit mean' for calling out Mr Liu.</p>

<p>'But then I remembered the #Uyghur concentration camps and #HongKong and quickly got over it,' he wrote.</p>

<p>Felt a bit mean for this. But then I remembered the #Uyghur concentration camps and #HongKong and quickly got over it.</p>

<p>Commenting on the incident, Benedict Rogers, chair and co-founder of UK-based human rights group Hong Kong Watch, said 'I want to thank <?php echo e('@'); ?>AmbLiuXiaoMing for blocking me'.</p>

<p>'If this is how he spends his time - when he's not spreading mendacity or harassing critics - I would rather not see,' Mr Rogers tweeted.</p>

<p>The Chinese Embassy in the UK said that the incident was a 'vicious' attack from 'some anti-China elements' against Mr Liu.</p>

<p>In a statement, it said: 'Recently, some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public.</p>

<p>'The Chinese Embassy strongly condemns such abominable behaviour.</p>

<p>'The Embassy has reported this to Twitter company and urged the latter to make thorough investigations and handle this matter seriously.' </p>

<p>Mr Liu has repeatedly championed Beijing's rhetoric over key diplomatic issues, such as Hong Kong, coronavirus, Huawei and human rights abuses, as tensions between China and the UK escalated.</p>

<p>In July, he warned the UK it would 'pay the price' for treating China like a 'hostile country'.</p>

<p>He said Britain would have to 'bear the consequences' of its foreign policy decisions and that would mean losing the benefits of being Beijing's 'partner'.</p>

<p>Liu Xiaoming also claimed some British politicians appear to be 'clamouring for a new Cold War' as he insisted China wants to be the UK's 'friend'.</p>

<p>Appearing on the Andrew Marr Show, Liu Xiaoming denied reports that China is carrying out a programme of sterilisation of Uighur women in the western Xinjiang region.</p>

<p>He insisted Uighur Muslims lived in 'peace and harmony' despite being confronted with a video appearing to show shackled prisoners being herded onto trains.</p>
