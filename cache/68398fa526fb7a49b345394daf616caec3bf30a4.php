<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Mason Mount has given his full support to under-fire team-mate Kepa Arrizabalaga after the Chelsea goalkeeper made yet another critical error during the 2-0 defeat by Liverpool. </p>

<p>There was little Kepa could do to keep out Sadio Mane's bullet header on 50 minutes after Andreas Christensen was shown a red card for hauling the forward to the floor on the brink of half time. </p>

<p>However, Blues were still reeling from Liverpool's opener when Kepa recklessly passed straight to Mane in front of goal, and the Senegal international controlled skilfully before gratefully passing into an empty net. </p>

<p>Mason Mount has defended team-mate Kepa Arrizabalaga (C) after the Chelsea goalkeeper gifted Liverpool and Sadio Mane their second goal in the 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge</p>

<p>Mason Mount suggests Chelsea's outfield players shouls shoulder take some of the blame</p>

<p>The hosts might have found a way back into the game but Jorginho saw his penalty saved by Alisson Becker, and Mount suggests Chelsea's players must share responsibility after the disappointing result. </p>

<p>'We know that Kepa is an experienced goalkeeper, he will look at it and he knows where he needs to look at it and improve but we are all going to be behind him,' Mount said at full time.</p>

<p>'We all make mistakes, I make mistakes, I give the ball away but it's just in their half and I can give the ball away and it's different when it's the back four, but as I said, we are all behind him, we all support him and it doesn't matter because now we need to look towards the next game now.'</p>

<p>Blues manager Frank Lampard stood by Arrizabalaga after opening game mistake at Brighton</p>

<p>Chelsea are poised to sign Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy for a fee that could rise to £26m</p>

<p>Kepa began the 2020-21 campaign by misjudging the flight of Leandro Trossard's effort in the 3-1 victory at Brighton, and while Frank Lampard showed faith in his keeper by selecting him at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard's latest mistake could spell the end of his Chelsea career. </p>

<p>The Premier League side club are set to replace Kepa, who made a world-record £71m move from Athletic Bilbao in 2018, by signing Edouard Mendy from Rennes. </p>

<p>Blues have agreed to pay £22million plus add-ons for the 28-year-old stopper.</p>

<p>The Frenchman will undergo a medical this week before penning a five-year deal. </p>
