<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Boris Johnson is set to delay plans to partially return fans to all sports stadiums on October 1 due to the recent spike in Covid cases. </p>

<p>Pilot events have been taking place with a maximum of 1,000 fans in each stadium, with the intention of returning all venues to 30 percent capacity by the start of next month. </p>

<p>But both measures will soon be shelved in light of increasing restrictions, sources told BBC Radio 4. </p>

<p>The Guardian also reported a source as saying the 'mood music' was that the return of spectators would be abandoned.  </p>

<p>It came as 100 sports organisations, including the Premier League, FA and Rugby Football Union, wrote to Mr Johnson calling for urgent funding to avoid a 'lost generation' of physical activity.  </p>

<p>According to a letter reportedly seen by BBC Sport, the group warns the future of the sector is 'perilous' and urges the Government to provide a 'sports recovery fund' in order to help the industry endure the prolonged effects of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The letter, written by organisations including the Football Association, Premier League, Rugby Football Union and England and Wales Cricket Board, reportedly states: 'We require a comprehensive support package for the sport and physical sector to aid its recovery.</p>

<p>'This package must combine investment, tax incentives, and regulatory reform.</p>

<p>'Covid-19 has undermined our commercial revenue streams with both stadiums and leisure facilities closed or greatly reduced in capacity. The impact of this will potentially lead to a lost generation of sport and activity.'</p>

<p>Lisa Wainwight, chief executive of the Sport and Recreation Alliance, told the BBC: 'The strength of this coalition from the sports, recreation and activity sector cannot be ignored in its public call to the prime minister.</p>

<p>'It is imperative that our sector gets the support it requires from the government to get back to business, in order to ease the pressures on the NHS and play a central role in our nation's recovery.'</p>
