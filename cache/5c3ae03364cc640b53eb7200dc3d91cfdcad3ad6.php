<p>Patriotic: The deep red flourishes and cushions bearing the Welsh dragon reference the bungalow's geographic location </p>

<p>The actor is thought to have paid a modest £725,000 for the home in 2007, according to property website Right Move, and it has remained in his ownership ever since.</p>

<p>In 2010 Barrowman was forced to deny claims that he was leaving the area after arranging an enormous three day fire-sale of old belongings outside his home. </p>

<p>He told Wales Online: 'I’m not moving, I love Wales too much.' </p>

<p>His agent also confirmed the actor had no plans to sell the property, adding: 'I can confirm that John is not moving to the US. He will be shooting Torchwood over there for five months next year, however he will continue to live in Wales.' </p>

<p>Separate: The two living areas are split level and both feature welcoming views of the Welsh coastline </p>

<p>Nice: Polished wooden floors, a fixture throughout much of the four bedroom home, offer an additional touch of style </p>

<p>Come on in: The master bathroom features a tiled floor and a generously sized tub, surrounded by potted plants  </p>

<p>Plenty of room: Matching twin sinks take advantage of the master bathroom's considerable space</p>

<p>The actor has been away from the United Kingdom for the duration of lockown, choosing to spend his extended period of isolation with architect husband Scott Gill at their second home in Palm Springs, California. </p>

<p>Speaking to the Daily Mail from the United States in August, Barrowman said:  'A lot of the friends I speak to on a daily basis are in the UK. If Covid hadn’t happened we’d have been here only for a month.</p>

<p>‘I was going to be working on some stuff in the UK, but that all went out the window. Everything stopped. There’s nothing on the horizon until January.</p>

<p>'I’m used to being busy, but there are only so many times I could lean the floor or the toilet. By the time I’d done it ten times I was thinking, “OK what do I do now?” Then it just hit me: I don’t have people I can ring up and talk to.’</p>

<p>Roots: Cushions bearing the flag of Scotland pay tribute to the actor's Scottish roots in one of the property's four bedrooms </p>

<p>The actor is now giving serious thought to fatherhood, and has looked to other same sex couples for inspiration as he ponders the idea of having children.  </p>

<p>‘I’d like a child of my own,’ he said. ‘Scott’s more into adopting an older child, but he’s always said to me, “If you’d like to have a baby you do it. I’ll obviously go along with it.”’</p>

<p>‘I said, “It doesn’t work that way. I can’t go out like I’m going to buy a new car.”’ </p>

<p>He added: ‘Lockdown has made us realise that we’ve a lot of time on our hands. I know I can work less now and spend more time at home, so there’s an epiphany.</p>

<p>‘I’ve been watching a lot of programmes on parenting. I also follow a lot of couples online and on Instagram — younger couples such as [diver] Tom Daley and his husband [Dustin Lance Black].</p>

<p>‘Then I think, “John, you’re 53 and Scott’s 57”. But Elton [John] and David [Furnish] did it later in life, so it can be done.’</p>

<p>Park up: According to Zoopla 'the property also has a double garage, parking for several cars and an inner courtyard' </p>
