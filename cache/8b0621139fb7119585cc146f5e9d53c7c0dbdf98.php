<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>AFL star Majak Daw has been dropped from North Melbourne just weeks after he returned to the game following a bridge fall that left him learning to walk again. </p>

<p>Daw is one of 11 players let go from the club's roster this week in an overhaul following a poor 2020 season which sees them in contention for the wooden spoon.  </p>

<p>The first Sudanese player to debut in the AFL in 2013, Daw played 54 games before a fall from Melbourne's Bolte Bridge in 2018 sidelined him for two years. </p>

<p>Ben Jacobs (pictured with partner) was also shown the door in the dramatic shake-up at the club </p>

<p>The 29-year-old, who stands at almost two metres tall, suffered hip and pelvic injuries in the fall and had two 15cm metal rods inserted in his hips. </p>

<p>'I played one final, and I think I played 54 games in 11 years, so it's quite a humble career, but I'd just like to thank this footy club for giving me an opportunity to be the first African to play in the AFL. It's something I will always hold close to my heart.' Daw said through a club statement. </p>

<p>'I've made some really good mates at this place. I'll miss the locker room banter … it just didn't work out the way I wanted it to this year, there's been challenges I've gone through.' </p>

<p>'The last few years obviously haven't been easy for me, and I can't thank this footy club enough for what they've done for me.' </p>

<p>Daw's manager told the Herald Sun he is keen to play on elsewhere if another club has a spot on their roster. </p>

<p>Greater Western Sydney player Aidan Corr is set to move to North Melbourne leaving no room for Daw on the roster. </p>

<p>Despite only playing four games this year, Kangaroos coach Rhys Shaw said Daw's return to top level footy was one of the most extraordinary achievements he had witnessed in his career. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old, who stands at almost two metres tall, suffered hip and pelvic injuries in the fall and had two 15cm metal rods inserted in his hips </p>

<p>Ben Brown (pictured with partner) and North Melbourne have also agreed to not renew his contract </p>

<p>'How Majak was able to physically recover and mentally get himself back to playing elite level football will be the stuff of legend,' he said. </p>

<p>He also praised his achievements in raising awareness for mental health and being a role model for the African community in Melbourne.  </p>

<p>Other players let go from the team include Jasper Pittard and Jamie Macmillan who were senior members of the Kangaroos leadership group.  </p>

<p>Sam Durdin, Marley Williams, Joel Crocker, Lachie Hosie Tom Murphy, Ben Jacobs, Paul Ahern, and Mason Wood were also shown the door. </p>

<p>Ben Brown, whose $2million three-year contract deal stalled, and in demand mid-fielder Jared Polec are also likely to leave the club on their own steam. </p>
