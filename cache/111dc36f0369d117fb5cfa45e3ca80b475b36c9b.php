<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amy Childs revealed she 'lost herself' for a couple of years, but has finally started to feel like herself again.</p>

<p>The former TOWIE star, 30, spoke candidly with new! Magazine on Tuesday, and admitted she 'forgot who she was' after her daughter Polly, three, and son Ritchie, two, were born, but got her 'mojo back' after returning to the reality show.</p>

<p>Of her struggle at the time, she explained: 'I feel like I've got my life back! I've got my mojo back. A couple of years ago after having the two children I felt like I lost myself a bit.'</p>

<p>Honest: Amy Childs claimed in an interview on Tuesday she 'lost herself' for several years after giving birth to her two children but feels she has finally 'got her mojo back' after TOWIE return</p>

<p>Amy added that even her family and friends had told her she was 'not the fun Amy' they knew as she struggled with her mental health.</p>

<p>'I was a little bit down from the break-ups. I forgot who I was. Having two kids is hard work and there's just 15 months between Polly and Ritchie. </p>

<p>'Being a mum is the most rewarding job in the world, but you lose yourself and it becomes all about them.  I don't know if I had depression, but I felt very low at times.'</p>

<p>Motherhood: Amy said she 'forgot who she was' shortly after her daughter Polly (pictured), three, and son Ritchie, two, were born</p>

<p>Amy added that she is very happy with her current beau Tim, who she said has a 'lovely' relationship with her two children.</p>

<p>The reality star explained that her boyfriend is proud of her achievements and also 'loves [her] so much', which has made her believe he is The One, though she claimed she would want to move homes with him before considering getting engaged. </p>

<p>Amy returned to the TOWIE scene for the first time in nine years earlier this month, and her daughter Polly even made an appearance on the reality show.</p>

<p>She shares daughter Polly with her builder ex Bradley Wright, and son Ritchie Jr with businessman ex Ritchie. </p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun about their parenting styles, she explained that she and Ritchie's father made the decision to keep their child out of the public eye, which is why he hasn't been featured on social media or television. </p>

<p>Shockingly, Amy revealed she had been accused of not loving her son as much due to the decision. </p>

<p>Reflecting: Speaking about her mental health, she went on 'Being a mum is the most rewarding job in the world, but you lose yourself and it becomes all about them'</p>

<p>Family: Amy returned to the TOWIE scene for the first time in nine years earlier this month, and her daughter Polly even made an appearance on the reality show</p>

<p>She explained: 'He is a beautiful little boy, he is like a mini-me and of course I love him every bit as much as Polly. Polly has a different dad and I made different decision with Polly and it is that simple.</p>

<p>'It was a hard decision because I don't want Ritchie or Polly to grow up and say why did you do that with me and not my brother and sister.</p>

<p>'All the constant messages questioning my love for Ritchie does get me down though because I love my children exactly the same.'</p>

<p>Amy has protected Ritchie's privacy so fiercely that his name was not even revealed until March this year, when she accidentally let it slip in an interview.  </p>

<p>For them: Amy explained that she and Ritchie's father made the decision to keep their child out of the public eye, which is why he hasn't been featured on social media (Polly, pictured)</p>
