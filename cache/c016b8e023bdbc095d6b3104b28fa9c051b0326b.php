<p>The girl had scratched her sister and her mother's new boyfriend during the medical episode triggered by loud noises on television, which prompted the man to fetch a long chain, the court heard. </p>

<p>The 43-year-old Illawarra man (pictured), who isn't named to protect the identity of his daughter, pleaded guilty in the Wollongong Local Court on Wednesday to assault and intimidation charges over the December 2018 incident </p>

<p>The father told the court he 'played along' because he didn't want to cause trouble with his ex's new boyfriend, the Illawarra Mercury reported.  </p>

<p>At one point both men stood in front of the defenceless girl and taunted her before throwing a blanket over her head.  </p>

<p>The victim's sister took three videos of the incident and told anyone who was watching to 'call someone' before her father demanded she stop recording because he was 'wanted'.</p>

<p>One video showed the disabled teen chained up on the ground as both men continued to taunt her and laugh. </p>

<p>At one point the victim pleaded to be let go while the mum's boyfriend could be heard threatening to break the sister's phone if she didn't stop filming. </p>

<p>According to a set of agreed facts the mobile phone footage was automatically uploaded to an iCloud account belonging to the phone's previous owner. </p>

<p>That person saw the confronting videos and immediately reported them to police. </p>

<p>After his arrest the father told police he intended to torment his daughter but not physically hurt her before admitting his behaviour was wrong.  </p>

<p>He remains in police custody and will be sentenced on October 9. </p>

<p>Video of the incident was filmed by the girl's sister and uploaded to iCloud before someone reported the footage to police, the man (pictured) said they were just trying to teach his daughter a lesson</p>
