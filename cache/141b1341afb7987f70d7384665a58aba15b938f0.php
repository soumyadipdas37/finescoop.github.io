<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Eric Dier and Dele Alli were involved in a furious bust-up in the aftermath of Tottenham's defeat to Wolves last season, it has been revealed.</p>

<p>Episode seven of the All or Nothing Amazon Prime documentary on Spurs's 2019/20 season partly focuses on their defeat to the Molineux side at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March.</p>

<p>The 3-2 reverse was Spurs' third straight defeat at the time which severely damaged their chances of qualifying for the Champions League.</p>

<p>Dele Alli was involved in a bust-up with Tottenham team-mate Eric Dier, it has been revealed</p>

<p>Dier and Alli clashed after Spurs' defeat to Wolves at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in March</p>

<p>Alli threw his boots to the ground after entering the changing room before the clash ensued</p>

<p>Spurs led 2-1 at half-time but goals from Diogo Jota and Raul Jimenez consigned them to defeat, and the documentary captures a stroppy Alli after the game.</p>

<p>The England midfielder throws his boots down saying: 'How the f*** did we lose that? F***ing same every single game. Three of the worst goals I've ever seen in my life. Same problem.'</p>

<p>Dier then responds as the heated argument begins, saying: 'Del, why you keep on saying these comments?', to which Alli replies: 'Nothing's changing.'</p>

<p>Dier retorts back saying: 'OK well put a name on them at least yeah? Don't just sit there like a spoilt kid.'</p>

<p>Raul Jimenez scored the winning goal for the visitors as the hosts suffered a third straight loss</p>

<p>Alli admits the whole team is to blame, including himself, before Dier mocks Alli's initial reaction of throwing his boots.</p>

<p>Dele then instructs Dier to sit there, causing the latter to respond: 'It would be more helpful if you did.'</p>

<p>Spurs boss Jose Mourinho is sat next to Alli as the bust-up unfolds, and at one point puts his arm around the Spurs and England midfielder.</p>

<p>Jose Mourinho was also present in the changing rooms during the duo's heated argument</p>

<p>Another coach is sat next to Dier to ensure the situation does not get out of hand, and Mourinho also chips in saying: 'I am happy that you had both these reactions, which is obviously because we lost.</p>

<p>'We lost the game because we couldn't make a foul to stop transitions. </p>

<p>The goals were all transitions and you have to be nasty, you have to be aggressive, you need to be clever, you need to make the foul.'</p>
