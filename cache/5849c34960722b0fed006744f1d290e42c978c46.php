<p>A mother-of-two who died on a party boat on the Sydney Harbour was likely killed by poisonous gas which leaked onto the ship from a faulty sewage system, an investigation has found.</p>

<p>Shalina Abdulhussein, 39, was found slumped over a bathroom sink on the three-level Lady Rose catamaran on February 2, 2019. </p>

<p>She had been attending a birthday party on the ship before her body was discovered by a deckhand during the four-hour cruise.</p>

<p>Rumours quickly began swirling that she had been died of a drug overdose but her family vehemently denied those claims.</p>

<p>An investigation by the Office of Transport Safety has found a 'faulty waterless basin trap' within the sewage system led to the release of hydrogen sulphide into the cubicle.</p>

<p>Hydrogen sulphide is a colourless gas, which smells like rotten eggs. High-level exposure of the poisonous gas can be deadly.</p>

<p>The investigation found Ms Abdulhussein was likely overcome by the harmful gas before passing out and dying during the party, The Sydney Morning Herald reported.</p>

<p>Ms Abdulhussein had been on board the Lady Rose catamaran for a four-hour birthday party</p>

<p>Partygoers were treated for shock after Ms Abdulhussein was found. Some reported a 'weird smell' on board the ship</p>

<p>The investigation also found the crew lacked urgency in dealing with the gas as guests had reported a strong 'rotting egg' smell four hours before Ms Abdulhussein's body as found. </p>

<p>The Lady Rose left Pyrmont at 12.30pm with the 27 party guests on board. Within half an hour of their trip passengers complained of a smell. </p>

<p>Several passengers then began feeling unwell and began vomiting. </p>

<p>The master of the boat was informed of the issue at 2.50pm.</p>

<p>He decided to dock at Bailey’s Marine, White Bay to empty the sewage system.</p>

<p>Ms Abdulhussein had entered the cubicle at 3.30pm, before the ship had docked. </p>

<p>She was later found slumped over a bathroom sink and could not be revived.</p>

<p> The Lady Rose left Pyrmont at 12.30pm with the 27 party guests on board. Within half an hour of their trip passengers complained of a smell</p>

<p>The captain of the ship Paul Titze, 45, of Botany, has been charged with multiple offences by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) relating to the incident.</p>

<p>Titze has pleaded guilty to unreasonably placing the safety of another person at risk, court records show, the Daily Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>However, he has pleaded not guilty to operating recklessly or negligently while master of the Lady Rose on February 2, 2019.</p>

<p>The case has been adjourned and the matter will return for a hearing at a later date. </p>

<p>Ms Abdulhussein's death has been referred to the coroner.</p>
