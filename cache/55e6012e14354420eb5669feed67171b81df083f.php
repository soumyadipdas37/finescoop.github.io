<p>A BBC spokesman said today: 'The pandemic means a different Proms this year and one of the consequences, under COVID-19 restrictions, is we are not able to bring together massed voices.  </p>

<p>'For that reason we took the artistic decision not to sing Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory in the Hall.</p>

<p>The Last Night of the Proms is pictured at the Royal Albert Hall on September 8, 2012</p>

<p>'We have been looking hard at what else might be possible and we have a solution. Both pieces will now include a select group of BBC Singers. </p>

<p>'This means the words will be sung in the Hall, and as we have always made clear, audiences will be free to sing along at home. </p>

<p>'While it can’t be a full choir, and we are unable to have audiences in the Hall, we are doing everything possible to make it special and want a Last Night truly to remember. We hope everyone will welcome this solution. </p>

<p>'We think the night itself will be a very special moment for the country - and one that is much needed after a difficult period for everyone. It will not be a usual Last Night, but it will be a night not just to look forward to, but to remember.'</p>
