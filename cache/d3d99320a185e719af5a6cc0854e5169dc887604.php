<p>Lip launch: The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills' own Lisa Rinna heralded the arrival of her signature cosmetics brand Rinna Beauty on Thursday, with a timeless shot of her famous lips</p>

<p>'I've always joked about being the lip pioneer,' the mother-of-two said. 'I've always wanted to do something with these lips. </p>

<p>'I finally feel like we're getting to do it and have fun and have a sense of humor, and really bring quality items that I just absolutely love, that my heart and soul are in and part of,' Lisa continued. </p>

<p>Of her plans for the line, Lisa said, 'of course I want to go into everything down the line. Rinna Beauty is going to be a lifestyle brand. </p>

<p>'But we started with three lip kits — in nude, nude-pink and nude-coral, because that is what I wear,' the Bravo star told Allure.</p>

<p>On Instagram, Rinna chose a closeup shot taken by photographer Greg Swales in which she stares straight at the camera from underneath a black fedora, to announce the arrival of the lipstick line.</p>

<p>As always, the focus of Lisa's face in the snap is her iconic pout, bathed here in a creamy gloss.</p>

<p>'BREAKING NEWS!' she wrote in the caption, along with a healthy helping of lipstick kiss emojis. 'RINNA BEAUTY Rinnabeauty.com It’s finally here! <?php echo e('@'); ?>rinnabeauty'</p>

<p>Introducing Rinna Beauty: 'I've always joked about being the lip pioneer,' the mother-of-two said. 'I've always wanted to do something with these lips'</p>

<p>In keeping with Lisa's trademark spunk and grit, the shade names for her lipsticks are Birthday Suit, Legends Only and No Apologies — the last one especially serving as an ode to her unapologetic spirit. </p>

<p>The kits will include a lip liner, a lipstick, and a lip gloss. </p>

<p>And when asked who inspired Lisa when it came to conceiving the new line, she didn't hesitate with a lengthy and impassioned answer. </p>

<p>'Certainly my daughters [Delilah Belle and Amelia Gray] are an inspiration. Every single second of every single day,' the wife of Harry Hamlin replied. </p>

<p>'I have so many great friends and so many beautiful friends. I mean, you just, you think of everybody and I'm so inspired by not only the girls on the show, Erika [Girardi] and Dorit [Kemsley] and Kyle [Richards]... all of my friends are beautiful, strong women.' </p>

<p>But Lisa didn't stop there: 'I'm inspired by my 92-year-old mom, who's worn lipstick and won't go out of the house, by the way, without her makeup' she added when speaking to Allure. </p>

<p>'I've actually never seen my mom go out in public without lipstick. [So] I want this to be all-inclusive. I want men, women, children — everybody! — to use Rinna Beauty.'</p>
