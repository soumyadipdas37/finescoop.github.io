<p>During Monday's episode of Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid playfully labelled her co-host a 'chubster', which inspired Piers' wife Celia Walden piece in The Telegraph. </p>

<p>Addressing her column on Tuesday's show, Piers, 55, announced that Celia, 44, had headlined the piece: 'My husband needs to be fat-shamed.'</p>

<p>Sweet couple: Piers Morgan was left in hysterics after his lockdown weight gain became the subject of his wife Celia Walden's latest column (pictured in February) </p>

<p>Reading highlights of the piece aloud, he recited: 'I have no issue with my husband's GMB co-host calling him a 'chubster' on live television.</p>

<p>'He, like me, is of the belief that a little bit of fat-shaming where it's due can be a good thing, and there's something shameful about the amount of blue cheese and Bordeaux that man's put away over the past six months. </p>

<p>'Moreover, the insults will actually help him lose the weight, he rightfully insists. Something our PC GPs might want to bear in mind for their next chubster patient shuffles through the door.I totally agree!'</p>

<p>Loggerheads: After reading his wife's words, Piers doubled down on his comments that fat-shaming is conducive to weight loss, while Susanna called the method 'disgusting'</p>

<p>After reading his wife's words, Piers doubled down on his comments that fat-shaming is conducive to weight loss, while Susanna called the method 'disgusting'. </p>

<p>The debate came after Piers encouraged his co-host to fat-shame him live on Monday's show, so he could use the insults as motivation to shed the pounds.  </p>

<p>Susanna, who admitted she had put on a stone over the past couple of months, turned to the columnist and scoffed: 'You fat person'.  </p>

<p>Teasing: Susanna playfully called Piers a 'chubster' on Monday's episode of the show after he revealed he had put on half a stone on in lockdown</p>

<p>Piers said: 'Like a lot of people in lockdown, especially when you bust your ankle up, I have put on weight.</p>

<p>'I am carrying too much weight. I reckon I put on at least half a stone, three quarters of a stone. I need to be fat-shamed to get it off.'</p>

<p>Taking the bait, Susanna told him: 'Yes, you fat person, lose the weight. It's about time, chubster.'</p>

<p>Susanna, who admitted she had put on a stone over the past couple of months, called the columnist: 'You fat person'</p>

<p>While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that.'</p>

<p>To which the Britain's Got Talent judge told her: 'No, that will genuinely have the right affect on me.  </p>

<p>'I will go back today and probably eat a little less cheese and put the second bottle away and try to get back on the Peloton for the first time in a few months.</p>

<p>'I think we all need to be slightly shamed about weight.'</p>

<p>Awkward: While Piers said the insults would help him lose the weight, Susanna said: 'That brings me out in hives just saying that'</p>

<p>But Susanna disagreed and told him: 'No, I don't think shaming works. Sensible advice works. Throwing insults does not help people lose weight.'</p>

<p>Piers shouted: 'No, saying 'stop chunking up fatso and eating so many cakes', that works. That's what you need to be told.'</p>
