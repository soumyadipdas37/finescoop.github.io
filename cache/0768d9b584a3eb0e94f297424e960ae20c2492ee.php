<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Irena Srbinovska has been tipped as a favourite to win Locklan 'Locky' Gilbert's heart on The Bachelor.</p>

<p>And it appears, the nurse, 31, has a surprising connection to former winner Snezana Wood.</p>

<p>Irena is Macedonian and interestingly Snezana, who met her husband Sam Wood on the third season of the show back in 2015, is from the same cultural background.   </p>

<p>Revealed: The Bachelor's Irena Srbinovska's (pictured) surprising link to 2015 winner Snezana Wood is revealed... so will she get her happy ending too?</p>

<p>Irena's name is also reportedly an ode to her Macedonian heritage.</p>

<p>An inside source recently told Daily Mail Australia Irena's pronunciation should be 'Ee-renna (with a European-sounding 'r'), instead of the version heard on TV - 'Eye-reen-ah'.</p>

<p>It's believed her name is written exactly the same, but the pronunciation on the show is not the 'real' intended way for Irena's name to be spoken.</p>

<p>Culture: Irena is Macedonian and interestingly Snezana (pictured with husband Sam Wood) is from the same cultural background</p>

<p>Meanwhile, former winner Snezana successfully found love with husband Sam Wood on the third season of The Bachelor.</p>

<p>They tied the knot in Byron Bay in 2018 and welcomed their second child, a daughter named Charlie Lane, last year. </p>

<p>The pair are also parents to two-year-old daughter Willow, and Eve, 15, who Snezana shares with a previous partner.</p>

<p>Irena has long been the odds favourite to win this series of the dating show, closely followed by friend and rival Bella Varelis.</p>

<p>On Monday, Locky told TV Week he was happily in love with his chosen contestant and 'can't wait to tell people how great she is'. </p>

<p>'Excited is an understatement,' Locky said of finally being able to reveal his girlfriend.</p>

<p>'I cannot wait. I am beyond excited to be able to finally say it out loud... who I have chosen to spend the rest of my life with.' </p>

<p>Will she get her happy ending? Irena has long been the odds favourite to win this series of the dating show, closely followed by friend and rival Bella Varelis</p>
