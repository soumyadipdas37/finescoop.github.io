<p>She said: 'It's just so fun and funny and entertaining, it's different, I don't feel like there's anything that's ever been done like this before, the whole format, us as judges.'</p>

<p>Discussing who they thought was the 'toughest' judge, the girls that admitted that Jesy was, but it a 'good way', while Perrie offers 'good technical advice'.  </p>

<p>Perrie said: 'In all fairness you would say that because you were there in the moment, a lot of it got cut, a lot of the not so good people got cut, and that's when I was probably a little bit more harsh.' </p>

<p>Dazzling: Glitz and glamour was the order of the day for their video</p>
