<p>'Winter Story Olsen came to us sept 15th,' Sarah continued. 'She's 10lbs 4 ounces of newborn bliss. Mama and baby are doing great, home safe surrounded by a cuddle puddle of kids and giant dogs.</p>

<p>'Life is equal parts spectacular and fleeting; Love fearlessly ✨,' she concluded, tagging her husband and including several other emojis. </p>

<p>One of the emojis was a rainbow, surely referring to Sarah's miscarriage last year. </p>

<p>Proud parents: Eric, who is also the co-founder of Baeo, already shares two children with Sarah – daughter Esmé Olivia, four, and son Wyatt Oliver, seven</p>

<p>The news of Sarah and Eric expecting their new child in May was joyful, but also mixed with sadness, as that was when it was revealed that they had suffered a miscarriage, late last year.</p>

<p>In a blog post about the loss of her baby, Sarah reflected that it was 'a big disappointment, and then also it's just really something that's not in your control, so it just felt sad. </p>

<p>'And I felt a little bit lonely,' she continued. </p>
