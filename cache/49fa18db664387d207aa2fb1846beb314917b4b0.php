<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>For the first time in its 60-year history Vogue Australia has featured an original artwork on its cover, made by a famed Aboriginal artist.</p>

<p>The design is titled Ngangkari Ngura - or Healing Country - and created by proud Pitjantjatjara woman and spiritual healer Betty Muffler.</p>

<p>'I'm so happy for my painting to be on the cover of Vogue Australia,' Muffler said.</p>

<p>'I've been working for a very a long time as a Ngangkari and an artist, and I can't believe my artwork is going to be on the magazine. Through my paintings you can see my Ngangkari work: watching over people and also looking after Country. </p>

<p>'My Country. This place is very important – we all need to look after each other and respect our home.'</p>

<p>For the first time in its 60-year history Vogue Australia has featured an original artwork on its cover (pictured)</p>

<p>Muffler's paintings depict her connection to The Dreaming, her Country and her work as a spiritual healer.</p>

<p>The Vogue issue includes a detailed explanation of her upbringing in remote South Australia, her renowned powers as a spiritual healer, how she has dealt with the pandemic and how that has influenced her art. </p>

<p>Edwina McCann, Vogue Australia's editor-in-chief, said the September cover looks and feels like no other.</p>

<p>She said all the editors of Vogue met virtually in April to discuss how all 26 versions of the magazine could offer a message of hope during the pandemic. </p>

<p>The global endeavour was spearheaded by Anna Wintour, the editor-in-chief of Vogue and artistic director for publishers Condé Nast. </p>

<p>'We worked closely with the National Gallery of Australia to commission Betty, who is renowned as a great painter. When the world went into lockdown, Betty painted to heal herself, her people, and her Country,' McCann said.</p>

<p>'Our heartfelt thanks to Betty for believing Vogue is a deserving home for her work, and message.'</p>

<p>She also thanked National Gallery of Australia's director, Nick Mitzevich, for working with the magazine so they could commission two of Muffler's artwork.</p>

<p>The artwork has been gifted to the gallery, with feature in the cover of the Australian issue and inside all other 25 issues. </p>

<p>Last month's cover (pictured) featured model Adut Akech Bior and had a message of Unity, while highlighting the voices of Australia's youth</p>

<p>'It's my wish that now more Australians will know Betty's name and appreciate her gifts, talent and story. I also want this issue to offer readers hope, too, as we work together to navigate and support one another through these difficult times,' McCann said.</p>

<p>'We hope to rebuild an even better and braver Australia, and we believe we will by harnessing the best of the Australian spirit together.' </p>
