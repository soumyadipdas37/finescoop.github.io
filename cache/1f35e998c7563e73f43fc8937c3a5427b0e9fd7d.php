<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wife of a police officer who nearly died after investigating the Salisbury poisonings said 'actions speak louder than words' in response to a tweet by the Prime Minister.</p>

<p>Boris Johnson joined world leaders in demanding answers from Russia amid claims Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny was poisoned using Novichok - which was also used in the 2018 attack in Wiltshire that left one woman dead.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson described the use of the deadly nerve agent as 'outrageous', adding: 'We have seen first-hand the deadly consequences of Novichok in the UK.</p>

<p>'The Russian government must now explain what happened to Mr Navalny - we will work with international partners to ensure justice is done.'</p>

<p>The tweet was shared by Sarah Bailey, the wife of Wiltshire Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey who almost died after he was exposed to the substance while responding to the 2018 attack.</p>

<p>Mr Johnson described the use of the deadly nerve agent as 'outrageous', adding: 'We have seen first-hand the deadly consequences of Novichok in the UK'</p>

<p>Sharing the tweet on Wednesday evening, she wrote: 'Justice would be nice. Actions speak louder than words.'</p>

<p>Her husband also shared the Prime Minister's tweet, with a short message which read: 'I have so much that I want to say about this tweet. But I can't, and I won't.'</p>

<p>He has spoken previously of 'still trying to pick up the pieces' of his life after becoming seriously ill from the poisoning, and losing his family home and possessions due to contamination fears.</p>

<p>Det Sgt Bailey was the first person to enter the home of Sergei Skripal after the Russian former double agent and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned on a park bench in Salisbury.</p>

<p>The tweet was shared by Sarah Bailey, the wife of Wiltshire Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey (both pictured) who almost died after he was exposed to the substance while responding to the 2018 attack</p>

<p>Sharing the tweet on Wednesday evening, she wrote: 'Justice would be nice. Actions speak louder than words'</p>

<p>He recovered after a two-week stay in intensive care, during which his wife and two daughters feared he would die.</p>

<p>Alexei Navalny could have had poison sprinkled in his underwear, according to the man who invented Novichok.</p>

<p>Friends of the Putin critic have suggested his tea was spiked in an airport cafe, but former Soviet scientist Vladimir Uglev said assassins could have sprinkled a deadly toxin on his socks or underwear. </p>

<p>Uglev, 73, said Russian secret service operatives could have broken into Navalny's hotel in Tomsk to leave a minuscule drop of poison in his luggage. </p>

<p>He warned that 'if this was indeed novichok, then Alexei [will] have some very serious complications'. </p>

<p>'Most likely the central and the peripheral nervous systems will be severely damaged,' Uglev said. </p>

<p>The scientist said Navalny may have been poisoned with a solid form of novichok known as A-242. </p>

<p>'If they used a liquid form, then inevitably somebody would have been hurt, people around him would have got inhalation injuries,' he said. </p>

<p>'This substance A-242 is safe by itself, but it acts as part of a solution applied to skin.</p>

<p>'It would be completely safe for other people and extremely dangerous to those who it was used against.'</p>

<p>Another scientist involved in novichok's development, Vil Mirzayanov, said it was plausible that Navalny's tea was spiked as his friends suggest.  </p>

<p>'This is a solid substance which can be turned into powder,' he said. 'It could have been placed into a tea bag.</p>

<p>'It got into the victim's digestive tract which is why Navalny could not pose any danger to people around him.' </p>

<p>He made a third attempt to return to work in June this year, describing how he 'couldn't deal with being in a police environment' after efforts to return in September 2018 and in January 2019.</p>

<p>The Skripals also recovered, but local woman Dawn Sturgess, 44, died months after the incident, having picked up the discarded perfume bottle used by Russian agents to hold the Novichok in nearby town Amesbury.</p>

<p>The Soviet-era chemical weapon made headlines again this week after it was revealed Mr Navalny, a politician and corruption investigator, fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from Siberia on August 20.</p>

<p>He was transferred to Berlin for treatment, with the German government saying testing at one of their military laboratories showed 'proof without doubt of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group'.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old remains on a ventilator in intensive care.</p>

<p>Britain has now said the Kremlin 'has a clear case to answer' while NATO demanded a 'full and transparent' investigation after a German military lab found that Navalny was poisoned with Novichok. </p>

<p>Angela Merkel is now facing pressure to get tough with Vladimir Putin, with questions growing about the future of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. </p>

<p>One German lawmaker said 'toughness is the only language Putin understands' - suggesting that the Kremlin had targeted Navalny as a show of force to intimidate protesters in Belarus.  </p>

<p>Navalny remains in a coma at a Berlin hospital after he collapsed on a flight in Siberia two weeks ago, becoming the latest in a long line of Russian dissidents to be poisoned in mysterious circumstances. </p>

<p>Russia denies involvement and accused German politicians of 'taking the job away from medics' with 'absolute unscrupulousness' last night. </p>

<p>Merkel said last night that the findings at the German military lab had raised 'some very serious questions that only Russia can and must answer'. </p>

<p>'It is certain that Alexei Navalny is the victim of a crime,' she added. 'He was meant to be silenced and I condemn this in the strongest possible terms.' </p>

<p>UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab said the Kremlin 'has a clear case to answer' and 'must tell the truth about what happened', while prime minister Boris Johnson called the attack 'outrageous'.  </p>

<p>European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen condemned a 'despicable and cowardly act', while French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian denounced the attack as 'shocking and irresponsible.'</p>

<p>'The Russian people have a right to express their views peacefully without fear of retribution of any kind, and certainly not with chemical agents,' said US National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot.</p>

<p>NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg condemned the 'shocking' use of a military-grade nerve agent which, he said, made 'a full and transparent' investigation by Russia even more urgent.</p>

<p>Italy's foreign ministry and Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne also condemned Navalny's poisoning.</p>

<p>The Western outrage has raised the prospect of new sanctions against Russia and thrown the Nord Stream 2 pipeline into fresh doubt. </p>

<p>Construction of the 750-mile pipeline under the Baltic Sea is nearly finished but it needs to complete a final 75-mile stretch in Danish waters. </p>

<p>Germany's best-selling newspaper, Bild, wrote in an editorial today that 'if the German government does not cancel the construction of Nord Stream 2, we will soon be financing Putin's Novichok attacks'. </p>

<p>Navalny is in a medically induced coma at the Charite hospital in Berlin (pictured on Wednesday) </p>

<p>A plane carrying Navalny arrives at Berlin's Tegel Airport on August 22 after the Russian opposition leader was airlifted to Germany for specialist treatment </p>

<p>Navalny's allies have pointed the finger at Russian president Vladimir Putin (pictured) after the opposition leader fell ill, but the Kremlin has dismissed the claims </p>

<p>The two men accused of trying to assassinate Sergei Skripal with the same nerve agent were filmed on CCTV walking through Salisbury in March 2018 </p>

<p>German lawmaker Norbert Roettgen, a member of Merkel's CDU party, called for a 'European response' said continuing with the gas pipeline would be 'maximum confirmation for Putin that his policies are right'. </p>

<p>Going further than Merkel, Roettgen said he did not believe that Novichok could have been administered without the Kremlin's knowledge. </p>

<p>'We need a clear and European response. It needs toughness against Russia, because that's the only language Putin understands,' he told ZDF television.   </p>

<p>He also suggested that Navalny's poisoning had been meant to intimidate protesters in Belarus who are demanding the resignation of the Putin-backed dictator. </p>

<p>'This is the simultaneous intimidation of [Russia's] own population and also that in Belarus,' he said.  </p>

<p>The Kremlin has hinted at using military force to shore up Alexander Lukashenko's regime in Belarus, which has faced mass protests since a disputed election last month.  </p>

<p>Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference and a former German ambassador to Washington, said gestures such as the expulsion of diplomats may not be enough. </p>

<p>'If we want to send a clear message to Moscow with our partners, then economic relations must be on the agenda and that means the NordStream 2 project must not be left out,' said Ischinger. </p>

<p>Germany's Green party, which is currently second to Merkel's party in the polls, is also calling for the pipeline to be scrapped.     </p>
