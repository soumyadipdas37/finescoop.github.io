<p>'We have all the safety measures in place,' said Vasant Swarnkar from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which oversees the UNESCO world heritage site in Agra south of New Delhi.</p>

<p>'We want to send out the message that things are not so bad and you will be safe if you follow the instructions.'</p>
