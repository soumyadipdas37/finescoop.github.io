<p>Darryl Dighton, 49, drove to James Tickle's property in Acacia Hills, in rural Darwin, to 'borrow' some meat for Australia Day on January 26</p>

<p>When he got to the home at midday and found no one was home, Dighton decided to help himself to steak and sausages in the freezer before driving off</p>

<p>He returned to the property after a few drinks with his mate to let Mr Tickle know what he'd done. </p>

<p>But still no one was home, so he left once more, driving off in his Nissan Navara, leaving behind skid marks on his way.</p>

<p>Dighton's wife then began getting messages calling her husband a 'grub' and challenging him to return to the property to face up to what he'd done. </p>

<p>On arrival he found Mr Tickle standing on the side of the road with a metal pole and wooden club.</p>

<p>Dighton yelled for Mr Tickle to drop his weapons and 'fight like a man' as he approached him. </p>

<p>Mr Tickle then swung the club, hitting Dighton several times on the head.</p>

<p>'He just hit me with a stick, jump into the vehicle and I'll drive over the c***,' Dighton yelled as he ran back to his ute.</p>

<p>Dighton bowled Mr Tickle over with his ute before driving over him several times. </p>

<p>Dighton appeared in the the Supreme Court this week where he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and attempted murder</p>

<p>Mr Tickle was flown to Adelaide to with 'catastrophic injuries'. He has likely permanently lost the use of his legs.</p>

<p>Dighton appeared in the the Supreme Court this week where he pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and attempted murder.</p>

<p>Dighton's barrister, Peter Maley, told the court his client had very little memory of the 'showdown'.</p>

<p>'(He) was emotional and couldn't believe what he did, and he said, in fairness, ''I deserve to be punished'',' Mr Maley said. </p>

<p>The matter will return to court on November 6 for sentencing. </p>
