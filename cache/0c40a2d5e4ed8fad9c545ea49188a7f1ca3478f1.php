<p>And Eloise is lucky enough to have her maternal great-great grandmother Margaret Wright, 74, to look up too as well.</p>

<p>As well as her parents, she has a grandmother, and great-grandmother on both sides of the family to dote on her too.</p>

<p>It means Mother's Day is busy, Christmas is expensive, and there is always a birthday party to look forward to - but the tight-knit clan said they really are one big happy family.</p>

<p>Eloise Holland was born in November, making her the fifth family generation on both her mother's and father's side.</p>

<p>Proud mum Sofia Holland, 18, has just finished studying business at college, and father Liam Underwood, 21, is a maintenance manager on the North Pier in Blackpool.</p>

<p>Sofia, from Blackpool, said: 'My daughter is perfect and I have the most amazing family around to support me as a young mum. I feel incredibly lucky.'</p>

<p>Sofia's mother, Karla Holland, 37, is a full time mum-of-five, while Liam's mother, Linda Barnes, 40, works as a full time carer.</p>

<p>They are both grandmothers to baby Eloise, and are the third generation of the family.</p>

<p>However the family doesn't stop there.</p>

<p>Karla's mother Carol Bellone, 53, is an advertising sales manager and Linda's mother, Kath Barnes, 70, is a retired saleswoman at Sandcastle Waterpark in Blackpool.</p>

<p>Both are great grandmothers to Eloise.</p>

<p>Sofia's mother, Karla Holland, 37, is a full time mum-of-five, while Liam's mother, Linda Barnes, 40, works as a full time carer.</p>

<p>Just when you think that is incredible enough as it is, baby Eloise has another generation of relatives up the family tree.</p>

<p>Carol's mum, 74-year-old ex professional ballroom dancer and retired student services worker Margaret Wright is Eloise's great-great grandmother.</p>

<p>When asked what the secret was to staying so young Margaret explained: 'The main thing is keeping up with the kids.</p>

<p>'They're always up and about, and it's knackering at times but I love them all dearly.</p>

<p>'We have great fun together.'</p>

<p>Eloise's great grandma Carol added: 'I like to think I'm cool and down with the kids. My six grandchildren and one great grandchild keep me fairly busy as you might expect!</p>

<p>'When the family gets together it is always filled with love and laughter, and on mothers day we always make a fuss of each other. It is a lovely time of the year for us.</p>

<p>'When we do squabble most of the time it's over Trivial Pursuit!'</p>

<p>Kath's mum, retired farm owner Brenda Scarisbrick completes the set, at the age of 97.</p>

<p>Eloise's great grandma Carol added: 'I like to think I'm cool and down with the kids. My six grandchildren and one great grandchild keep me fairly busy as you might expect!</p>

<p>Brenda, now a great great grandma, said: 'Eloise was lovingly welcomed in November as the newest member of the rabble and is absolutely spoilt rotten.</p>

<p>'There is lots of bickering to see who's turn it is to hold her or feed her, and Sofia is never short of a baby sitter!</p>

<p>'Funnily enough though there never seems to be a queue for a nappy change.'</p>

<p>When asked if she enjoyed having a massive family, Karla said: 'I love it. Were all so close and have so much fun together.</p>

<p>'Most of the time we don't feel like family it just feels like hanging around with your mates which is such a lovely feeling.</p>

<p>'Sofia had Eloise in November last year when she was 17, I had Sofia when I was 19, my mum had me when she was 16 and her mum had her when she was 19.</p>

<p>'We've all experienced being a young mum, and now Sofia has more support from the family than she can shake a stick at.</p>

<p>'Christmas is expensive but we wouldn't have it any other way. It's always busy with stuff going on but that's how we like it.</p>

<p>'There is always somebody to talk to when you need advice, and I can't imagine not being surrounded by all my amazing relatives.'</p>

<p>The whole family live in Blackpool, apart from Kath, who lives just 33 miles away in Southport.</p>
