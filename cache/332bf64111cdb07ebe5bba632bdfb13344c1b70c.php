<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A teenage girl has been left almost paralysed after her head fell off her spine due to a rare bone disorder that has caused more than 100 broken bones since birth.  </p>

<p>At just 17 years old, Beth Cooper-Wares should be partying with friends and sitting her school exams in her hometown of Jiggi, near Byron Bay in northern New South Wales.</p>

<p>Instead, the teenager is stuck in a bed at Westmead Children's Hospital in Sydney with a spine brace, known as a halo, drilled in to her skull following a catastrophic medical episode that began in August when her head separated from her neck. </p>

<p>Beth, who has been wheelchair bound since she was a child, was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) Type III - a severe form of brittle bone disease which means simple tasks like walking and changing can leave her with broken bones. </p>

<p>Her mother Katie Cooper-Wares opened up to Daily Mail Australia about her highly intelligent daughter's struggles as she tries to regain movement in her arms to follow her dream of being a writer.</p>

<p>While the family knew Beth's (pictured, left) condition would worsen as she grew, her mother Katie (right) said reality hit when her daughter started getting severe headaches</p>

<p>While the family knew Beth's condition would worsen as she grew, the 37-year-old mum-of-one said reality hit when her daughter started getting severe headaches.</p>

<p>'Her spine was moving up her skull and it was putting pressure on her brain,' Ms Cooper-Wares said.</p>

<p>Despite an operation to relieve the debilitating pain in her head, the teen wound up in an ambulance five weeks later and was rushed into surgery.</p>

<p>'During the operation the doctors realised her head had basically fallen off her spine,' her mother explained.</p>

<p>During their world trip, Katie drank coffee and Beth (pictured) ate croissants in Paris every morning before her condition detiorated</p>

<p>Doctors made the decision during surgery on September 18 to fuse her spine to her skull to keep it stabilised.</p>

<p>The teenager woke up on her 17th birthday to find that she not only had a halo drilled into her bones and a breathing tube down her throat rendering speech impossible, but she had lost the ability to move her body. </p>

<p>'Her upper body used to be really strong - she used to play the ukulele,' her mother shared. </p>

<p>Though she couldn't speak with a breathing tube, Ms Cooper-Wares was able to figure out what her daughter wanted by lip reading. </p>

<p>'She was in so much pain and hadn't eaten for days, but she's a real foodie and just wanted me to keep talking about food.'</p>

<p>The devoted mother spent hours by her daughter's hospital bed spouting everything she knew about food to keep her entertained. </p>

<p>Once she exhausted her food knowledge, Ms Cooper-Wares asked her Facebook friends to give her more food facts to keep Beth distracted from her painful reality.</p>

<p>'She would close her eyes and just listen.'</p>

<p>Ms Cooper-Wares also said Beth was on so much medication she swore she saw Pennywise - the killer clown from the Stephen King thriller, It - in the hospital.</p>

<p>Ten days on from spinal fusion surgery, Beth has regained some movement in her left foot and hand.</p>

<p>'She's happy about that because she writes with her left hand, but it's very slow and we're not sure how much strength she'll regain.'</p>

<p>'They often die in their sleep,' Ms Cooper-Wares. 'That has happened to a lot of people with the condition.'</p>

<p>'Sometimes, when she's asleep, I go into her room and watch her breath. To make sure.' </p>

<p>Despite the prognosis, Ms Cooper-Wares said her daughter is 'crazy resilient and strong'.</p>

<p>'She's so smart - she's the top of all her classes and she has a lot of patience.' </p>

<p>'I don't think I would be able to deal with the things she's dealt with in her life up to this point - she's incredibly strong.'</p>

<p>To aid Beth's recovery, the family created a Go Fund Me page to help ensure her mother can continue to care for her without worrying about how to pay the bills.</p>

<p>Despite the prognosis, Ms Cooper-Wares said her daughter is 'crazy resilient and strong' (pictured: Beth as a child)</p>

<p>The money will cover medical costs that aren't part of the National Disability Insurance Scheme, along with a home set up to make Beth more comfortable - such as an electric bed.</p>

<p>'She'll also need to wear a medical and it's made of sheep skin, so coming into summer, we'll need to get air conditioning to make sure she's cool.'</p>

<p>Beth plans on finishing school in 2021 and studying creative writing at university. </p>

<p>At the age of 11 in 2015, Ms Cooper-Wares decided that her daughter needed a boost before facing the major surgery scheduled in her teenage years to help her mobility.</p>

<p>Beth dreamed of swimming with turtles, riding in a hot air balloon at sunset, seeing a show on Broadway, seeing elephants in the wild, having a mud bath in China and volunteering to teach English in India.</p>

<p>She came up with a plan to help Beth see the world and empower her for the future.</p>

<p>The got Beth a wheelchair and sold all their possessions, including the car, to make the trip happen.</p>

<p>Ms Cooper-Wares said the trip definitely made Beth more wordly and was a fantastic experience for her to have.  </p>

<p>Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited bone disorder that is present at birth, also known as brittle bone disease. </p>

<p>A child born with OI may have soft bones that break easily, bones that are not formed normally, and other problems. </p>

<p>Type III is the most severe type in babies who don’t die as newborns. </p>

<p>At birth, a baby may have slightly shorter arms and legs than normal and arm, leg, and rib fractures. </p>

<p>A baby may also have a larger than normal head, a triangle-shaped face, a deformed chest and spine, and breathing and swallowing problems.</p>

<p>There is no known cure. </p>
