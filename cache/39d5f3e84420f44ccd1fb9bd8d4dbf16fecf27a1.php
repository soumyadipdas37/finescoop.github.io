<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hornby enjoyed a lockdown boost, as housebound families turned to hobbies to entertain themselves.</p>

<p>The firm, famous for its model trains, said sales between April and August had been higher than the previous year and exceeded its expectations.</p>

<p>As the company held its annual shareholder meeting yesterday, Hornby, which also owns brands including Airfix and Scalextric, confirmed its operations are 'nearly back to normal' following lockdown.</p>

<p>The few: Demand for models during lockdown was so high that Hornby ran out of Airfix Spitfires (pictured) – though they are now back in stock</p>

<p>Chief executive Lyndon Davies said: 'We've seen sales increase across all brands and in all markets. In lockdown we could see more things like Airfix selling. Everyone stuck at home was twiddling their thumbs.'</p>

<p>Hornby even ran out of Airfix Spitfires – though they are now back in stock. </p>

<p>Davies said adults had sought comfort in toys of their childhood. He said: 'Parents and grandparents know names like Airfix and Hornby, so that's what they've turned to.' </p>

<p>His eldest daughter is a nurse, inspiring him to sell 'Captain Tom' locomotives and give the proceeds to the NHS. It raised £140,000.</p>
