<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Drew Barrymore debuted her new daytime talk show to the world on Monday.</p>

<p>And the lifelong actress kicked things off with a bang, welcoming her dear friends and Charlie's Angels co-stars Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu along for the first episode.</p>

<p>While the trio was clearly delighted to reunite, Drew, 45, admitted there was a bit of a bump in the road when she accidentally sent her text message invite for the gals to a random 'young boy.'</p>

<p>Big premiere! Drew Barrymore reunited the Charlie's Angels gang for the premiere of her new daytime TV talk show on Monday</p>

<p>Whoops! The girls were delighted to be together, but Drew had to reveal how her original invitation text to Cameron accidentally got sent to 'a young boy' </p>

<p>The 50 First Dates actress was full of love when she introduced her pals saying: 'I couldn’t begin this journey without two women who have been a part of my heart for over 20 years.'</p>

<p>'We are friends, we are fellow angels,' she went on about her 2000s era co-stars.</p>

<p>There was a bit of TV magic going on, making things look like all three were in studio together while actually split between an LA and NY shoot to socially distance per COVID-19 standards. Diaz was in LA while the other two were in NYC with a safe six-feet apart. </p>

<p>But the pandemic wasn't the only hurdle the angelic reunion had to overcome.</p>

<p>Drew's sweet invitation to her friends didn't actually make it to the stars, and instead found its way to someone Barrymore described as a 'young boy.' </p>

<p>Lots of love: The 50 First Dates actress was full of love when she introduced her pals saying: 'I couldn’t begin this journey without two women who have been a part of my heart for over 20 years</p>

<p>Heaven sent: 'We are friends, we are fellow angels,' she went on about her 2000s era co-stars, seen in 2003's Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle above</p>

<p>Far and away: There was a bit of TV magic going on, making things look like all three were in studio together while actually split between an LA and NY shoot to socially distance per COVID-19 standards</p>

<p>Return to sender? Before the reunion Drew tried to reach out to her friends, but her sweet text invitation strangely found its way to someone Barrymore described as a 'young boy'</p>

<p>'First I sent Cameron a video and I'm saying "Hey listen... I want to ask you something. Will you come on my show?' </p>

<p>'...Because I'm so comfortable - I mean we have lived together all over the world -  so of course, to save time I sent her a video while I'm getting dressed.' </p>

<p>Cameron and Lucy couldn't help but giggle as Drew continued.</p>

<p>'You don't see anything! I'm not that dumb,' she laughed, 'But I'm getting out of the shower and I'm ringing out of my towel.'</p>

<p>Strangely, Drew got zero response, prompting some concern.</p>

<p>'I don't hear back from her for like two days and I'm like "This is weird..."'</p>

<p>Strange... Drew said she was confused after Cameron kept her on read for 'two days,' so she called to check in</p>

<p>Can't help but giggle: Diaz burst into full laughter, as Drew revealed how the message went to someone completely random</p>

<p>After getting a bit 'freaked out' by the situation, Drew decided to call Cameron and see what's up.  </p>

<p>'So I call her and I'm like "What is going on? I'm worried. Is everything okay?"</p>

<p>But Cameron had no clue what Drew was even talking about.</p>

<p>'I'm like, "the video? You didn't get my video?" </p>

<p>At that point, Diaz burst into full laughter, as Drew revealed how the message went to someone completely random.</p>

<p>'Turns out, a young boy watched the video,' Barrymore said with wide eyes.</p>

<p>'Lucky him!' Lucy chimed in.</p>

<p>Special delivery? 'Turns out, a young boy watched the video,' Barrymore said, prompting Lucy to chime in and say 'Lucky him!'</p>

<p>Extensive: Cameron was happy to provide a bit more context, revealing 'By the way, it's like seven minutes long... It's epic'</p>
