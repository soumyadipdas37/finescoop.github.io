<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Johnson &amp; Johnson's coronavirus vaccine candidate prevented severe illness in a small group of hamsters, the drugmaker said on Thursday. </p>

<p>In the pre-clinical study, vaccinated animals lost less weight and had less virus in their lungs and other organs than unvaccinated animals.</p>

<p>Hamsters that received the vaccine, called Ad26-S.PP, produced neutralizing antibodies, which health experts believe is vital to build immunity against COVID-19.</p>

<p>What's more, none of the inoculated hamsters experienced severe outcomes such as pneumonia or death.</p>

<p>It comes as the White House fervently denied that anyone from the Trump administration is putting political pressure on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve a vaccine before the November 3 presidential election. </p>

<p>On Thursday, White House Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said there is no pressure on the FDA from Trump to approve a vaccine before the election. Pictured: McEnany holds a news briefing at the White House, Thursday</p>

<p>The company began early-stage human trials in the US and Belgium in July after details of a study in monkeys showed its best-performing vaccine candidate offered strong protection in a single dose. </p>

<p>'This pre-clinical study further validates our confidence in our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate,' Paul Stoffels, Chief Scientific Officer for J&amp;J, said in a statement, according to CNBC.</p>

<p>'With our Phase 3 trials planned to start this month, we remain committed to expanding our manufacturing and distribution capabilities to enable global access to our SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate should it prove to be safe and effective in humans.'  </p>

<p>In the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, Syrian golden hamsters, which are more susceptible to diseases than monkeys, were vaccinated and then exposed to the coronavirus after four weeks.</p>

<p>The researchers found low levels of antibodies that can neutralize the virus were tied to high levels of weight loss.</p>

<p>Additionally, viral loads decreased from day two of infection to day seven.</p>

<p>'Our data demonstrate that a single immunization of Ad26-S.PP provides robust protection against severe clinical disease after high-dose SARS-CoV-2 infection in hamsters,' the authors wrote.</p>

<p>Depending on data from the early-stage human trial, J&amp;J plans to begin phase III testing in the second half of September in more than 60,000 people.</p>

<p>The late-stage trial will be conducted at 180 locations in the US and at least eight other countries including Brazil, Chile, the Philippines and South Africa.</p>

<p>In the US, locations will be in 28 states such as California, Florida, Texas, the states with the most overall cases and among the highest transmission rates. </p>

<p>J&amp;J's vaccine combines genetic material from the new virus with the genes of the adenovirus - which causes the common cold - to induce an immune response.</p>

<p>It is the same technology the company used to make an experimental Ebola vaccine for people in the Democratic Republic of Congo in late 2019.</p>

<p>According to the World Health Organization, there are more than 170 vaccines in various stages of development with about 30 in human trials.</p>

<p>None have been authorized yet except for one in Russia, but this was done before large-scale trials were conducted.</p>

<p>On Thursday, White House Spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said there is no political pressure on the FDA to quickly approve a coronavirus immunization.</p>

<p>This is after it was revealed that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested a jab could be ready just ahead of the November presidential election. </p>

<p>'No one is pressuring the FDA to do anything. his is again a bizarre theory spun up by CNN among others,' McEnany said.</p>

<p>She said President Donald Trump wants to push through regulatory barriers as quickly as possible, but not at the cost of safety. </p>

<p>'But he will not in any way sacrifice safety and making sure that is 100 percent airtight for the American people to receive it,' McEnany said.</p>

<p>'So, the priority here is saving lives, safety, and there will be a safe and effective vaccine in the works.' </p>
