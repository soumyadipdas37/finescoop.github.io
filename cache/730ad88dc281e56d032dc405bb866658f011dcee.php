<p>Stela Moris, who began dating Assange in 2015, revealed how the pair managed to keep their relationship - and her pregnancy - under wraps while he was hiding out at the Ecuadorian embassy in London </p>

<p>Moris, who is engaged to Assange, told CBS News the couple shared private moments in a 'camping tent' in his room, away from the CCTV cameras</p>

<p>'We found ways to be private. We had a tent in his room that we put fairy lights in… you know, like a camping tent,' Moris said, adding that the shelter kept them out of view from CCTV cameras. </p>

<p>The 37-year-old met Assange almost a decade ago after she helped work on a legal bid to halt his extraditions. </p>

<p>Shortly after those private encounters at the embassy, Moris became pregnant with their first child in 2016 and again in 2019. </p>

<p>In an earlier interview with 60 Minutes, she revealed she was able to hide both her pregnancies from authorities and the media by layering clothes over baby bump.</p>

<p>'I just piled on layers [of clothes] and complained about getting fat to hide it,' Moris said. </p>

<p>The boys have rarely seen their father since they were born but despite the unconventional circumstances, Moris said Assange was 'the man I wanted to start a family with.'</p>

<p>'I was 33 and we decided, you know, let's live our lives,' she told the news station.  </p>

<p>'I try to give them [kids] as normal a feeling of a family as I can,' she said, adding that the boys speak to their father every day.  </p>

<p>'I tell them that Julian is a hero. And I want them to just see our love and their father's affection to the extent that we can.'  </p>

<p>Moris said she plans to marry Assange outside Belmarsh Prison in London's outskirts by Christmas this year. </p>

<p>Moris is aware there is a chance the children will never be reunited with their father again.  </p>

<p>She told the Sydney Morning Herald she would love to move to Australia as long as the government can protect her family. </p>

<p>'I'll live wherever he is safe and that's why I want Australia to tell us that he will be safe there,' she said.  </p>
