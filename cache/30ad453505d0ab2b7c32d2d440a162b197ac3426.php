<p>But this week Kaia Gerber, 19, and Cindy Crawford, 54, paired up for a modeling job for Omega watches.</p>

<p>Twice as nice: This mother-daughter supermodel team has not worked together in many years. But this week Kaia Gerber, 19, and Cindy Crawford, 54, paired up for a modeling job for Omega</p>

<p>'When your garage is converted into a studio, WFH takes on a whole new meaning! On set with my favorite model <?php echo e('@'); ?>kaiagerber for <?php echo e('@'); ?>omega ❤️,' said Crawford, who started modeling as a teen just like her mini me has.</p>

<p>Both of the ladies were dressed in black as they put their arms around each other in the drab surroundings.  </p>

<p>The two have collaborated in the past.</p>

<p>In April 2016 they were side by side on the cover of Vogue Paris, shot by famed photographer Mario Testino. They were even styled to look like twins, wearing matching leather jackets and hoop earrings while their brunette locks catch some wind. </p>

<p>Making do: The photo shoot was far from glamorous, however, as the snaps had to be taken in the veteran supermodel's garage due to the lockdown from COVID-19</p>

<p>Cindy was clearly quite proud of her little lookalike, sharing the image on Instagram with the message: 'Such a special moment sharing a cover with my daughter.'</p>

<p>In 2019 Cindy talked about her daughter's incredible career and said to Porter Edit she did not mold it for her.</p>

<p>'She is my daughter, and people know that. But when people say that I bought her a cover of a magazine, I think, if I was going to buy a cover for someone, it would be me,' she continues. 'If I could get someone into a fashion show, I would be getting it for myself.'</p>

<p>At 16, Kaia jumped into her career.</p>

<p>Model genes: 'When your garage is converted into a studio, WFH takes on a whole new meaning! On set with my favorite model <?php echo e('@'); ?>kaiagerber for <?php echo e('@'); ?>omega ❤️,' said Crawford, who started modeling as a teen just like her mini me has</p>

<p>'I couldn't really hold her back. … You hope that all of the advice and guidance and role modeling that you did sticks. That's the stage of parenting when you think, 'Ok, hope you can fly!'</p>

<p>The two often come off as more like sisters than mother and daughter.</p>

<p>In 2016 Cindy revealed to The Coveteur that she has tons of designer items socked away that she's saving for her daughter in an 'archival closet'.</p>

<p>Dead ringers: Both of the ladies were dressed in black as they put their arms around each other in the drab surroundings</p>

<p>'I have a lot of clothes that actually I haven't even opened,' she said. 'I've saved old Alaïa pieces from when I used to do his show and he used to pay us in clothes, or Chanel, so those are in a separate closet — more like an archival closet that I'm keeping for my daughter.'</p>

<p>While she's waiting, though, Kaia is happy to grab from her mom's actual closet — and she doesn't always return what she finds there.</p>

<p>'I'll ask to borrow things, and they'll wind up in my own wardrobe permanently,' she admitted to Teen Vogue, adding that her favorite find there has been a distressed leather jacket that she hasn't put back. 'My mother constantly wonders why stuff disappears.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Kaia seems to be dating Kissing Booth actor Jacob Elordi as they have been holding hands in NYC all month.</p>
