<p>Kellie Rossi Larsen, of Logan, Utah, captured pet Nova's toothy grin on video after he was caught relieving his bowels on her carpet. </p>

<p>'Nova, what is this?' Larsen can be heard saying in the video as the dog, Nova, tries to slink past her.</p>

<p>'What is this? Was this you? Did you poop in the house?' she asks as she alternates between showing the dog and the offending excrement in question. </p>

<p>A Utah woman's dog, Nova, was caught on video making the 'cheesy' grin he uses when attempting to get out of trouble, in this case, pooping on the carpet</p>

<p>In response, Nova sits down and mugs for his owner, showing off all of his teeth in a wide grin.   </p>

<p>'We recently moved into a new house, and one of our three dogs, Nova, had a little accident in the house because everything is new and confusing,' Larsen told ViralPig.</p>

<p>'When Nova thinks he's in trouble he does that cheesy smile to try and get out of it.'</p>
