<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Newcastle United's record signing Joelinton could have scored a hat-trick in the Carabao Cup against Morecambe but managed to not convert from one-yard out.</p>

<p>The £40million striker, who has endured a tough career so far at Newcastle, managed to score two goals - the same as his entire Premier League tally last season - as Steve Bruce's side asserted their dominance in a 7-0 victory over League Two opposition.</p>

<p>Jacob Murphy went on a winding run through the Morecambe defence and approached the byline as he sent a cross in towards the No 9.</p>

<p>Newcastle's record signing Joelinton missed a golden chance for hat-trick vs Morecambe</p>

<p>Jacob Murphy went on a winding run through the Morecambe defence and crossed it to him</p>

<p>Joelinton decided the let the ball run past him and it ricochets off the post and back past him</p>

<p>The chipped, looping cross was falling straight into the path of Joelinton, who was practically standing on the goal line for the easiest tap-in of his career and what would have been his second goal on the night. </p>

<p>However, he decided the let the ball run past him and it ricochets off the post and back past him.</p>

<p>The Morecambe goalkeeper was then able to dive on the ball as Joelinton could only stand there inside the six-yard box wondering why he didn't try to knock it in.</p>

<p>Newcastle fans took to Twitter after the incredible blunder, as one fan tweeted: 'Joelinton could've had his first hat trick today if he didn't miss the easiest chance I've actually ever seen'</p>

<p>Another fan said: 'I don't know what I'm more shocked at. That miss by Joelinton or the fact he scored earlier'.</p>

<p>The striker did make up for his error very shortly after, as he found the top corner from range with a wonderful strike as the Magpies ran riot. </p>

<p>After the resounding victory, manager Steve Bruce revealed that the Brazilian thought the ball was going in, hence why he left it. </p>

<p>When asked on the miss, he replied: 'He thought it was going in and wanted Jacob to get a goal.' </p>
