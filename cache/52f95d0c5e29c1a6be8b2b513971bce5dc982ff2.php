<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A dominatrix has insisted that people should 'accept this sort of behaviour' after her and her 'slave' were barred from a gastropub in Cumbria for public sadomasochistic display.</p>

<p>Dominatrix Lydia Chadwick, 30, had tied her 'slave' to a roof beam with a dog lead and spanked the masked person with a paddle on Sunday evening at The Mill in Ulverston - in full view of other diners. </p>

<p>Customers who witnessed the sadomasochistic session filmed the bizarre episode and shared it online.</p>

<p>But Lydia reportedly defended her actions, telling The Sun: 'People should get out of the dark ages and accept this sort of behaviour.</p>

<p>'Most people are just treating it as a laugh.' </p>

<p>A dominatrix and her 'slave' have been banned from The Mill in Ulverston, Cumbria, after putting on a sadomasochistic session on the terrace in full display of customers</p>

<p>Lydia added that she had taken a friend from Camden, who identifies as a woman, into the pub because she wanted to be publicly humiliated, The Sun reported.</p>

<p>She said: 'She said she wanted to be publicly humiliated so I was going to take her to a local beauty spot where the walkers go. </p>

<p>'We thought we would give them something to laugh at. I did that for another customer before the lockdown. </p>

<p>'But we were running out of time and decided to go for a drink in The Mill. </p>

<p>'I was going to walk her on a dog lead, but she got embarrassed with everyone looking at us. </p>

<p>'We signed in and went to the roof terrace, where I chained her to the rafters. </p>

<p>'I blindfolded her and pretended to walk away and leave her as part of the humiliation. I was videoing it and we didn't think anyone else could see.'</p>

<p>In the video, the sound of the spanking could be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers.</p>

<p>The 'slave' was dressed in black fishnet stocking and suspenders and red knickers, while his mistress wore a black dress as she beat his bottom with a black paddle.    </p>

<p>Lydia, who told The Sun being a dominatrix is 'just a job', said she did not mean to upset The Mill and will 'apologise to them', adding that her family were upset after the video went viral. </p>

<p>But the owner of The Mill has slammed the couple for their exhibitionism after the X-rated incident and barred them from the pub.</p>

<p>Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill (above), hit out at the couple, who he believes has ties to the Ulverston area, for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'</p>

<p>A picture on social media, also shows a message allegedly written by a member of staff after the incident.</p>

<p>It read: 'I sat them upstairs on the terrace, these lads came down that were sat up there ten minutes later telling us to go up and see what's happening - and she has him tied up with a dog lead on one of the beams, whipping him.'</p>

<p>The message also alludes to the fact that the man's genitalia was on display.</p>

<p>Michelle Wood, general manager of The Mill, told The Sun that it was not 'behaviour that we wanted to encourage'.</p>

<p>She said: 'The couple signed in as all customers are asked to do for pandemic regulations and it was obvious that the man was dressed as a woman.</p>

<p>'But in 2020 if you turn men away because they are dressed as women then it is discrimination. </p>

<p>'One of the other customers started filming what was going on and then came to tell the staff. </p>

<p>'They just embarrassed us for her financial gain.'</p>

<p>The couple are believed to be part of the BDSM community. BDSM refers to often erotic practices which can involve bondage, dominance or submission.</p>

<p>One witness wrote on Twitter: 'Why is there old blokes getting spanked in suspenders out back of The Mill in Ulverston?'</p>

<p>Shocked customers who witnessed the spanking session shared a video online. The sound of the spanking can be heard above the soundtrack of Lovely Day by Bill Withers</p>

<p>Another Twitter user added: 'Unreal scenes coming from The Mill in Ulverston.'</p>

<p>The woman, a self confessed 'mistress', appeared to share the video of the act on Facebook, but has since been removed from the site.</p>

<p>It is not known whether she had deactivated her account, or if Facebook had suspended the profile.</p>

<p>Phil Simpson, owner of The Mill, believes the couple has ties to the Ulverston area and hit out at them for seeking to 'embarrass small local businesses'.</p>

<p>Mr Simpson added: 'As soon as we spotted this couple's activities they were told to leave our premises.</p>

<p>'They are now barred and having seen their post on social media the police have now contacted us for more information.</p>

<p>'We believe that the woman involved is Ulverston-based and we find it quite depressing that such people should seek to embarrass small local businesses in this manner for financial gain.'</p>
