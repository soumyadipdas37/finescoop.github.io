<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Airlines have pleaded for Covid-19 tests to be rolled out at airports so that the industry can begin to recover.</p>

<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) said pre-departure tests for all passengers would be the only way to replace the uncertain and fast-changing quarantine systems that have put people off travelling this summer.</p>

<p>And Tui, the world's biggest holiday group, also piled pressure on governments to introduce testing as it said summer bookings fell 83 per cent.</p>

<p>The International Air Transport Association said pre-departure tests for all passengers would be the only way to replace the uncertain and fast-changing quarantine systems</p>

<p>The company called for a 'regional risk assessment policy being applied by each government rather than a blanket travel policy'.</p>

<p>Tui has cut its winter schedule by a further 20 per cent to around 40 per cent of last year's capacity because of the 'continuous changes in travel advice'.</p>

<p>Industry leaders, airlines and airports have warned the global economy will nosedive until quarantines can be scrapped and passengers can move smoothly through borders. </p>

<p>Experts say quarantine rules for travellers to Britain are costing the tourism industry alone £650million a week.</p>

<p>IATA head Alexandre de Juniac demanded rapid and affordable tests that can be administered by a non-medical professional.</p>

<p>De Juniac said: 'We don't see any solution that would be less challenging or more effective.'</p>

<p>It is thought tests that cost a few pounds each could be available within weeks.</p>

<p>Failure to set up a testing regime could also cost more jobs in an industry battered by the Covid crisis. Tui yesterday said it would axe 8,000 jobs as it scrambles to cut costs.</p>

<p>And Airbus boss Guillaume Faury warned the plane maker's 'life as a business is at risk' because of coronavirus. </p>

<p>It has announced it would lay off more than 10 per cent of its global workforce, some 15,000 employees. About 1,700 jobs in the UK will go out of 13,500.</p>

<p>Although it wanted to avoid compulsory redundancies, Faury has said these might now be necessary, particularly in France and Germany.</p>

<p>Faury told a French radio station: 'The crisis is existential. Our life as a business is potentially at risk if we don't take the right measures.</p>

<p>And Willie Walsh, the former boss of British Airways-owner IAG, said the airline industry is never going to get back to the way it was before Covid.</p>

<p>He said that in around five years' time it would be a smaller sector, with fewer airlines, but more efficient.</p>

<p>Walsh said: 'It's never going to go back to the way it was.'</p>
