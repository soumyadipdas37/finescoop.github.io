<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Six trophies in fifteen years has proven Sevilla are well worthy of their 'Europa League specialists' label, but such dominance has failed to translate in the UEFA Super Cup final. </p>

<p>The Spanish club have been victorious in just one of their previous five appearances in the showpiece event, and will have their work cut out against Bayern Munich, winners of Europe's premier competition after their 1-0 triumph over PSG. </p>

<p>Hansi Flick's relentless side currently boast a 31-match unbeaten run, yet Sevilla are known to thrive in their role as underdogs, conceding an early penalty in each of their last three matches of last season's Europa League competition and ultimately in a 3-2 final victory over Inter Milan in Cologne.</p>

<p>Five key factors are likely to decide the outcome when Bayern Munich take on Sevilla at the Puskas Arena in Budapest on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>Robert Lewandowski will seek to fire Bayern Munich to Super Cup glory against Sevilla</p>

<p>At just 21-years-old, Jules Kounde is one of the most exciting talents in European football and his skills will be rigorously tested by Robert Lewandowski.</p>

<p>The defender has courted interest from Manchester City in recent weeks, with Sevilla sporting director Monchi revealing: 'We have received interest from one club for Jules. If they come back, we will listen and we will respond.' </p>

<p>The Frenchman's stock has risen over the course of Sevilla's latest Europa League-winning campaign, so City boss Pep Guardiola will be monitoring his transfer target as he continues his search for a partner to Aymeric Laporte.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lewandowski has scored a remarkable 55 goals in his last 46 appearances, netting his first of the new Bundesliga season in the 8-0 thrashing of Schalke. </p>

<p>Kounde's erratic centre-back partner Diego Carlos conceded three penalties in the latter stages of last year's Europa League competition, so expect Kounde to showcase his maturity and leadership qualities if Sevilla do indeed upset the odds in Hungary. </p>

<p>Alphonso Davies has become a key component of Bayern Munich's attacking play, but the full-back was absent during the club's opening Bundesliga match on Friday. </p>

<p>The Canadian was rested as a precaution and has travelled with the squad to Budapest, although he is likely to undergo a late fitness test.</p>

<p>The 19-year-old's electric pace enables Bayern to breach opposition defences and could enable the Bundesliga champions to get behind Sevilla's stubborn backline. </p>

<p>Julen Lopetegui deployed a fairly narrow midfield three in a 4-3-3 last term, so right winger Suso and right-sided midfielder Joan Jordan could be called upon to help deal with the dynamic Davies. </p>

<p>Ivan Rakitic is in line to make his second Sevilla debut at the Puskas Arena, six years after the midfielder left the Andalucian club for Barcelona. </p>

<p>The Croatian completed his return this month with Sevilla agreeing to pay an inital fee of £1.5m, and he will inevitably bring control and experience to Lopetegui's side. </p>

<p>However, the former Real Madrid coach is still trying to rebalance his midfield after influential club captain Ever Banega departed for Saudi Arabian club Al-Shabab.</p>

<p>While Rakitic may not be a like-for-like replacement, he will undoubtedly have to shoulder some of the creative load. Moments of quality such as Banega's cross for Lucas Ocampos' headed winner against Wolves are hard to come by.</p>

<p>Ivan Rakitic is set to play the first competitive match of his second spell with Sevilla</p>

<p>Joshua Kimmich will try to dominate Ivan Rakitic and other midfield counterparts as he looks to build upon his fine partnership with Leon Goretzka.</p>

<p>Flick employed a 4-2-3-1 formation against Schalke, with Benjamin Pavard stepped in at right-back while Kimmich played a more defensive midfield role. </p>

<p>The Germany international has taken both Thiago Alcantara's position and squad number after the Spaniard completed his summer move to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Thiago was often metronomic for Bayern, dictating play as they completed the double, but Kimmich's athleticism and technical ability allow him to play just about anywhere. </p>

<p>The 25-year-old's versatility has always been one of his most impressive attributes even displaying creative touches in midfield, recording seven goals and 17 assists in 2019-20. </p>

<p>One of the more intriguing duels in Budapest will see Jesus Navas take on Leroy Sane, as Bayern Munich's wingers move interchangeably.</p>

<p>Sane, who joined Bayern from Manchester City for £55m this summer, opened his account for his new club with a goal against Schalke last friday. </p>

<p>The 24-year-old operated on the right side of a front three at the Allianz Arena while hat-trick hero Serge Gnabry played on the left, but Bayern's fluidity in attack will see both players switch flanks intermittently. </p>

<p>Kingsley Coman has been omitted from Flick's Super Cup squad, meaning Navas, who himself represented City between 2013 and 2017, will inevitably have to use his own considerable pace to combat the direct Sane </p>

<p>Leroy Sane's direct running could cause problems for fellow former Man Cuty man Jesus Navas</p>
