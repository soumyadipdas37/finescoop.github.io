<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Seeing yourself grace the cover of Vogue must be an incredible experience for anyone.</p>

<p>But for actress Emma Corrin, 24, barely known before she was picked to play Princess Diana in Netflix hit The Crown, the experience must have been particularly difficult to believe.</p>

<p>And she was so surprised to spot herself on the fashion magazine cover in a newsagent’s window while walking her dog that she decided to record the moment with a photo.</p>

<p>'So surreal!': Emma Corrin was starstruck by her own image when she spotted her glam Vogue covershoot image on display at a newsagents while out walking her dog</p>

<p>Wearing square-shaped sunglasses, black boots, bright-yellow trousers and a tanktop, Miss Corrin’s look in her picture is in stark contrast to her image in Vogue, where she is dressed in a glamorous blue dress.</p>

<p>‘Still so bloody surreal!!!’ posted Miss Corrin, 24, alongside the photo on Instagram. </p>

<p>Cambridge University graduate Miss Corrin was picked to portray the ‘People’s Princess’ last year despite having only a handful of small roles to her name prior to her audition.</p>

<p>She told Vogue that playing Diana has given her a feeling of rapport with the late princess. ‘I feel I’ve got to know Diana like you would a friend,’ Miss Corrin said.</p>

<p>Coming up: Huge role: Emma (left) will portray Diana, Princess of Wales (pictured right in 1983) in the upcoming fourth season of The Crown, which comes to Netflix on November 15</p>

<p>‘I know that sounds really weird, but I get a great sense of companionship from her.’  </p>

<p>Ms Corrin also revealed to Vogue that she keeps a vibrator in her handbag – just like the late Diana, Princess of Wales.</p>

<p>The actress admitted that she likes using the sex toy as a way to 'unwind'.</p>

<p>In a recent video interview she said of the gadget as she revealed the contents of her bag: 'It’s great if you’re stressed and need to unwind. Also, it kind of looks like a lipstick so, you know, nice and subtle.'</p>

<p>Huge role: Emma will portray  the mother of princes William and Harry in the upcoming fourth season of The Crown, which comes to Netflix on November 15</p>

<p>Princess Diana had a 'secret mascot' in the form of a sex toy, which she took with her on all overseas trips as a good luck charm, her former bodyguard revealed in 2016. </p>

<p>Royal protection officer Ken Wharfe said the marital aid – which was referred to as 'Le Gaget', or 'the gadget' – was purchased on a 'wild staff night out' in Paris in 1992.</p>

<p>Wharfe claimed he then persuaded Diana's sister Sarah McCorquodale to hide the sex toy in the Princess of Wales' bag the next day. </p>

<p>The shock revelation was made by Wharfe in an updated edition of his book Diana: Closely Guarded Secret. </p>

<p>He added that the Princess 'loved pranks and practical jokes' and thought the toy was 'hilarious' before she quickly made it her 'secret mascot for foreign trips'. </p>

<p>The Crown season 4 will be available to watch on Netflix on November 15.</p>
