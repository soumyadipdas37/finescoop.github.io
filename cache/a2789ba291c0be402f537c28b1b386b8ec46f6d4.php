<p>The scene of a fatal stabbing and brawl at, O'Callaghan Park in Zillmere, Brisbane, Monday, September 14</p>

<p>Lawyer Nicholas Crawford is representing the four Wal brothers who are accused of Mekonnen's murder after they were allegedly identified using CCTV and mobile phone tower data.</p>

<p>'But there is no direct evidence or witnesses identifying who is supposed to have done what,' he said. </p>

<p>'They're not a part of a gang and they have no criminal convictions,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Crawford said he will fight the charges and apply for bail for his four clients. </p>

<p>Defence lawyer Andrew Owens is representing Anas Ayman Abdu Musa, who claims his client wasn't even at the park.</p>

<p>'He's doing well, it's obviously pretty overwhelming to be charged with murder in such a serious matter but he's keeping his head up.'</p>

<p>Mr Owens will also fight the charges for Musa and apply for bail. </p>

<p>Friends have explained Girum was simply 'in the wrong place at the wrong time' at the time of his death</p>

<p>Detective Superintendent Tony Fleming on Wednesday said it will be alleged those involved went to Zillmere with the intent to assault the victims.</p>

<p>'This was an event that was highly confrontational and has been traumatic for the victims of the crime and their families,' he said.</p>

<p>'It's just unacceptable to have people in a public space who are going about their business then attacked this way.'</p>

<p>Paramedics took 11 people to hospital with stab wounds and blunt force injuries after one group attacked another with knives and baseball bats.</p>

<p>Some of the victims were knifed in their torso, pelvis, head and face.</p>

<p>Three people remain in hospital with one in a serious condition.</p>

<p>'It's a horrific, unacceptable attack in our society,' Det Supt Fleming said.</p>

<p>'But retribution is not going to solve the problem.'</p>

<p>The 10 men were remanded in custody to return to court on November 16 for mention.</p>
