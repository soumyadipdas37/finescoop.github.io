<p>Sweet exchange: The 28-year-old singer, who announced her engagement to Max Ehrich in July, has revealed she is reevaluating the way she looks at her body after finding the 'most loving' man</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Demi previously revealed she fell in love with Max instantaneously.</p>

<p>She wrote on Twitter in July: 'When I was a little girl, my birth dad always called me his 'little partner' - something that might've sounded strange without his southern cowboy like accent. To me it made perfect sense. And today that word makes perfect sense again but today I'm officially going to be someone else's partner.</p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>maxehrich - I knew I loved you the moment I met you. It was something I can't describe to anyone who hasn't experienced it firsthand but luckily you did too.. I've never felt so unconditionally loved by someone in my life (other than my parents) flaws and all,' the two-time Grammy nominee continued. </p>

<p>Gentleman: 'I love every part of you baby,' Max reminded her, after Lovato asked him to ignore her 'double chin'</p>

<p>'You never pressure me to be anything other than myself. And you make me want to be the best version of myself. I'm honored to accept your hand in marriage. I love you more than a caption could express but I'm ecstatic to start a family and life with you. I love you forever my baby.' </p>

<p>Earlier this year, she also opened up about not always waking up and feeling 'super confident' and her life 'journey' coming with 'tons of ups and down.'</p>

<p>'I deal with s**t on the daily, but I know I'm gonna be okay with God on my side,' she said on Ashley Graham's Pretty Big Deal podcast in February, before talking about her near-fatal overdose in 2018. </p>

<p>The one: Demi previously revealed she fell in love with Max instantaneously when speaking about their July engagement on Twitter</p>

<p>Demi confessed: 'I'm tired of running myself into the ground with workouts and extreme dieting. I thought the past few years was recovery from an eating disorder, when it actually was just completely falling into it.'  </p>

<p>She furthered:  'I honestly think that's kind of what led to everything happening over the past year was just me thinking I found recovery when I didn't.'</p>

<p>While feeling like she was living a lie and 'trying to tell the world' she was happy with herself, Lovato admitted she wasn't. </p>

<p>Since her overdose, she has made her comeback with performances at the Grammys and Super Bowl LIV.  </p>
