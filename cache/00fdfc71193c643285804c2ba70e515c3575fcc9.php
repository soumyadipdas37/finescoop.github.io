<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Billionaire Tory party donor John Caudwell is facing a backlash after suggesting the government should have made the public build up herd immunity against coronavirus. </p>

<p>The tycoon, who lives in an opulent £250 million 15-bedroom Mayfair mega mansion, made the comments on Question Time as it returned to the BBC last night.</p>

<p>The Phones4u co-founder said: 'I've been making the point from day one that we should've invested the money in protecting the aged and the vulnerable, and let everybody else build up herd immunity.' </p>

<p>Mr Caudwell, 67, is the 97th richest person in the UK, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. </p>

<p>He sold his phones empire for £1.5 billion in 2006, and this year completed renovations on a 15-bedroom home by joining two Mayfair houses and turning them into one palatial mansion.</p>

<p>Viewers were quick to respond to his comments, with one tweeting: 'Something deeply sinister about a man who owns a £250 million mansion advocating herd immunity.' </p>

<p>Mr Caudwell also used the appearance on the BBC's Question Time to accuse European leaders of metaphorically beating Theresa May, Mr Johnson's predecessor, 'black and blue' as she sought a withdrawal agreement.  </p>

<p>He accused European nations of 'plundering our fishing waters' and taking billions in UK cash, telling Question Time: 'They are bullying us and beating us up. They beat Theresa May black and blue, and they have continued to try and do it all the way through. </p>

<p>'Fortunately Boris rose to the challenge and fought back. This behaviour by Brussels I find absolutely abhorrent, but of course the reason they are doing it is because they have got no option.</p>

<p>'Because if they gave Britain an easy ride the other European countries would see that and potentially there would be an exodus, possibly a mass exodus, possibly a complete collapse of the Union.</p>

<p>'Of course that is not what Brussels wants so they will use any means, fair or foul, to protect their situation.'</p>
