<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Accountancy giant Deloitte has been handed a record £15million fine over failings in its audit of British software group Autonomy before it was sold to Hewlett Packard in a blockbuster deal.</p>

<p>The Big Four accountant, along with former partners Richard Knights and Nigel Mercer, has been found guilty of 'serious and serial failures' that allowed Autonomy to make misleading claims in its balance sheet.  </p>

<p>A tribunal found that auditors at Deloitte failed to exercise 'adequate professional scepticism and to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence' for Autonomy in 2009 and 2010, the Financial Reporting Council said today. </p>

<p>As such, they failed 'to act with integrity and objectivity', the tribunal said.</p>

<p>Fined: Deloitte has been ordered to pay £15m fine and £5.6m for legal costs</p>

<p>Knights and Mercer were also given fines of £500,000 and £250,000 respectively for their roles in the audits, which HP claimed had been falsified. </p>

<p>The FRC added: 'Deloitte should not have issued unqualified audit opinions in these years based on the audit evidence obtained. </p>

<p>'Deloitte, Mr Knights and Mr Mercer fell seriously short of the standards to be expected of a reasonable auditor.' </p>

<p>Knights has also been excluded from membership of the Institute of Chartered Accountants for England and Wales for five years.</p>

<p>The Tribunal also ordered Deloitte to pay the £5.6million bill for costs of the investigation and tribunal. </p>

<p>Autonomy was sold to Hewlett Packard for £9billion in 2011 – but HP wrote off most of the company's value and claimed the firm's revenues and profits had been artificially inflated.</p>

<p>Former boss Mike Lynch, who is worth an estimated £469million, and other executives went on to make a fortune from the company's sale to HP.</p>

<p>But that deal and the questions over its accounts became the centre of a High Court battle, which is thought to have been one of the UK's biggest ever fraud trial.</p>

<p>Lynch, 55, faces separate criminal charges in the US and is fighting an extradition request.    </p>

<p>Elizabeth Barrett, FRC executive counsel, said: 'The significant sanctions imposed by the independent tribunal and announced today reflect the gravity and extent of the failings by Deloitte and two of its former partners in discharging their public interest duty concerning Autonomy's audits.</p>

<p>'The identified failures to act with integrity, objectivity, scepticism and professional competence go to the heart of audit.</p>

<p>'After lengthy, fully contested proceedings, the tribunal concluded that the audit work fell significantly short of the standards expected of an audit firm and its partners.'</p>

<p>The previous record fine handed out by the FRC was against Deloitte's Big Four rival, PwC, for £10million over its audit of retailer BHS.</p>

<p>A spokesperson from Deloitte said: 'We regret that the FRC tribunal has ruled that aspects of our audit work on Autonomy between 2009 and 2011 fell below professional standards required.</p>

<p>'Our audit practices and processes have evolved significantly since this work was performed over a decade ago and we continue to transform our audit by investing in firm-wide controls, technology and processes.</p>

<p>'We remain committed to playing our role in delivering change that embraces audit quality, improves choice and restores trust in the profession.'</p>
