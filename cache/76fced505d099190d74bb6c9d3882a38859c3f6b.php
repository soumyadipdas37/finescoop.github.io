<p>Prime suspect Christian Brueckner has been linked to a sex attack on a 10-year-old German girl on a beach in Portugal</p>

<p>A German woman, now 23, claims she recognised Christian Brueckner from TV as the man who grabbed her on Salema beach in April 2007, just weeks before Madeleine McCann (pictured) was abducted</p>

<p>The woman had been on a family holiday in Salema, Portugal, six miles from Praia da Luz where Madeleine McCann vanished aged three.</p>

<p>The sex attack happened just weeks before Madeleine disappeared on May 3.</p>

<p>Prosecutors examining the disappearance of the British toddler have reopened the file on the woman's attack.</p>

<p>According to The Sun, prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters confirmed the link between the two cases.</p>

<p>'The man currently in custody suspected of Madeleine McCann's abduction is also the suspect in a sex attack on a German girl,' he said.   </p>

<p>The British toddler disappeared from the Ocean Club apartments in Praia da Luz (pictured) on Portugal’s Algarve in May 2007</p>

<p>The convicted German paedophile Christian Brueckner, 43, is currently in prison in Kiel, Germany on a drugs conviction.  </p>

<p>Brueckner has numerous convictions for sex offences, including the sexual assault of children, and was found guilty of raping a 72-year-old American woman in 2005, close to where Madeleine vanished.  </p>

<p>German police identified Brueckner as the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case earlier this year and claimed they have 'concrete evidence' the toddler is dead.  </p>

<p>However, his lawyer Friedrich Fulscher maintains his client is innocent in relation to Madeleine McCann's disappearance and 'has nothing to hide'. </p>
