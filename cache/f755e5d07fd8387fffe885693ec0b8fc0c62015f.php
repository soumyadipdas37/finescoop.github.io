<p>During a recent interview on The Joe Rogan Experience she shared that she was undergoing a 'pivotal moment' by being single again.</p>

<p>'I haven't been single in like, I guess really from 2015 - I mean, there's been little months, so maybe about five years. Like I've had, you know, a few months here and there where I've been single but not for a long period of time,' she said.</p>
