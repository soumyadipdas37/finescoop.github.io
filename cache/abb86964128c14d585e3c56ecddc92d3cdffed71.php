<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bloggers are raving about $12 slip-on sandals from Kmart that are practically identical to a designer pair worth $265.</p>

<p>The 'Double Buckle Slides', which are available in black and white in women's sizes six to 11, are a carbon copy of the iconic 'Arizona' style from footwear label Birkenstock.</p>

<p>And with Kmart's discount dupe coming in a whopping $253 - or 22 times - cheaper, they are the obvious choice for cash-strapped Australian fashionistas in the midst of recession-proofing their finances.</p>

<p>The slides have received the seal of approval from leading influencers, with Melbourne stylist Maria - who posts on Instagram as 'The Budget Savvy Girl' - calling them her 'current obsession' and the 'most comfortable' she has ever owned. </p>

<p>Save or splurge: Kmart's $12 'Double Buckle Slides' (left) are strikingly similar to Birkenstock's iconic 'Arizona' sandals (right) which cost $265</p>

<p>Followers agreed, with many leaving comments praising the trendiness and affordability of the summery shoes.</p>

<p>'I'm wearing these today, so comfy. I love them,' one woman replied.</p>

<p>'Have these in white, can totally related to the obsession,' said a second, while a third called the slides 'such a bargain'.</p>

<p>The shoes are the latest piece of Kmart clothing to grab attention on social media, following a pair of stylish $22 trousers that look similar to a $1,390 pair from Italian luxury house, Bottega Veneta.</p>

<p>The sandals are also available in white with gold hardware, and come in women's sizes six to 11</p>

<p>The 'Tapered Leg Pants' have been flying out of stock since they were seen on Canberra fashion blogger 'This is Genevieve', who posted a series of outfit photos on Instagram featuring the bargain buy.</p>

<p>The pants - which come in beige and black and are available in sizes six to 20 - sit high on the waist and hang loose in a flattering cut that can be cuffed at the ankles, creating the illusion of longer legs.</p>

<p>Genevieve's followers couldn't believe the pants had come from the famously affordable retailer, with many noting the likeness to expensive pieces from designer labels.</p>

<p>'No WAY these are Kmart - I want!' one woman replied.</p>

<p>Another said the post had inspired her to buy beige trousers for the first time in years after almost a decade of shunning them for black.</p>

<p>Other gushing responses included 'wow, these are gorgeous', 'amazing!' and 'love'. </p>
