<p>Good morning! Holly Willoughby shared a snippet of her latest This Morning script on Wednesday - teasing a very risque segment</p>

<p>Holly captioned this: 'How your morning shaping up? Here’s mine! ⭐️'</p>

<p>Alison Hammond, who presents the show too, simply replied: 'Wow!'</p>

<p>And Holly's fans were just as tickled by this, also chiming in with funny reactions. </p>

<p>This Morning do enjoy causing a stir with their titillating and sometimes bizarre segments.</p>

<p>Oh my! The show host, 39, posted a snap to Instagram of her script - which was an intro to a segment with guest Dr Philippa, clearly talking about feminine health</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Holly and co-host Philip Schofield were challenged to make contact with their inner unicorns - and asked viewers at home to join in the surreal session. </p>

<p>Guest Diana Cooper evangelises about making contact with a positive inner unicorn after she had a visit from her own, Elfrietha, 12 years ago, something she admits was 'bit of a shock' at the time.</p>

<p>Appearing on the ITV daytime show she told hosts Holly and Phil - the latter of whom was particularly cynical about being able to use his 'third eye' to find the unicorn - that the mystical creatures use their horns to illuminate lives, heal souls and pour light into the world.</p>

<p>Making contact: On Tuesday, Holly and co-host Philip Schofield were challenged to make contact with their inner unicorns - and asked viewers at home to join in the surreal session </p>

<p>So convinced of unicorns being a force for good on the human race, Ms Cooper says the current onslaught of unicorn merchandise is deliberate, so people consider the fictional horned characters more deeply.</p>

<p>She told the programme: 'They are literally touching anyone who is ready, they've used all these cups and t-shirts to get in touch. When you think about a unicorn it starts to connect.'</p>

<p>Over several minutes, Ms Cooper asked the show's presenters, and surrounding crew, to listen to her soothing words with their eyes closed. </p>

<p>While Phillip admitted he was unmoved by the experience, Holly said she had in fact seen a unicorn before her when Ms Cooper had asked her to see it.</p>

<p>However, she followed up with: 'If you'd have asked me to see an armadillo, I would have seen that.' </p>

<p>Not convinced: Phillip kept his eyes open throughout and admitted that he hadn't felt 'a lot' during the Angel lady's session live on air</p>

<p>At times the presenting duo looked to on the verge of getting their famous giggles.  </p>

<p>At home, plenty were convinced by Ms Cooper, however, and said they'd not only seen the unicorn but also named it and even stroked it.</p>

<p>Former pop star Chesney Hawkes said: 'I found my inner unicorn with <?php echo e('@'); ?>hollywills and <?php echo e('@'); ?>schofe #ThisMorning. His name is Greg.'</p>

<p>Others praised the programmed for embracing more surreal features in a world dominated by Covid-related news. </p>

<p><?php echo e('@'); ?>Marie_MM16 wrote: 'I love this morning for this type of thing. Just when the world is so serious they want you to channel your inner unicorn. Priceless!' </p>

<p>Holly managed to stifle a laugh as she talked about how she saw a unicorn but admitted she felt it was only because Ms Cooper had told her to see one</p>
