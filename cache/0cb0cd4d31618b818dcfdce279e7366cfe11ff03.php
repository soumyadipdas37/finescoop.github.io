<p>Career focussed: On Wednesday, Joe Hildebrand (pictured) revealed to Confidential that he will be joining Sydney radio station 2GB as a presenter</p>

<p>He continued: 'These are battlers from the suburbs, people who live in the real world, who like straight talk and big laughs and I can’t wait to reconnect with them.' </p>

<p>On September 10, Jo broke down in tears live on air as he revealed he had come to the difficult decision to leave Studio 10 after seven years. </p>

<p>'I am leaving Studio 10. I have given it a huge amount of thought. It's been really hard, but also really lovely to be able to look back on all the things we have done,' he said.</p>

<p>'We all know the show is getting a bit of a shake-up. Channel 10 and my lovely bosses asked me if I'd stay on in a new role. We talked about it openly and warmly about what that might look like.'</p>

<p>Speaking of his bosses' reaction when he told them he was quitting, Joe said: 'They're really lovely about it, so don't lash out at them!' </p>

<p>'[I want to] give the show a chance to breathe and have a fresh start without me hanging around.'</p>
