<p>In his new social media picture Scott wore a snappy pair of shades as he and Penelope posed for a picture in front of a dazzling ocean view.</p>

<p>So sweet: Scott Disick warmly hugged his eight-year-old daughter Penelope in a heartwarming Instagram snap he posted Wednesday</p>

<p>A day earlier he posted a sweet photo that showed little Reign resting his face on his hands while staring mesmerized at the TV.</p>

<p>Scott and Kourtney met in 2006 at the Mexican home of Girls Gone Wild founder Joe francis and had an on-off romance until 2015.</p>

<p>The duo have retained a friendly co-parenting relationship ever since including throughout his two-year romance with Lionel Richie's 21-year-old daughter Sofia. </p>

<p>However a source recently told TMZ that Scott and Kourtney 'are not a couple, even though they've been hanging out more since his breakup with Sofia.'</p>

<p>Still amicable: Scott shares Penelope as well as his sons Mason, 10, and Reign, five, with his amicable ex Kourtney Kardashian, whom he split from in 2015</p>

<p>Dampening hopes of a reunion even further the insider shared: 'It's highly unlikely Scott and Kourtney will ever get back together as a couple. They still consider themselves a family and co-parenting their three children is a priority for both.'</p>

<p>This May Scott checked into rehab for 'emotional issues' and 'past traumas,' but checked out shortly thereafter. </p>

<p>In the wake of his decision to leave rehab Us Weekly reported he and Sofia were 'on a break until Scott straightens himself out more.'</p>

<p>Finally on May 27, the day after his 37th birthday, the magazine revealed that Scott and Sofia had decided to end their romance. </p>

<p>So sweet: A day earlier he posted a sweet photo that showed little Reign resting his face on his hands while staring mesmerized at the TV</p>

<p>Sofia was seen spending time with Scott in July and there were rumors they may have reignited their relationship.</p>

<p>The dynamic duo spent Independence Day together and a People source said in mid-July that they are 'trying to make things work while taking things slow.'</p>

<p>But in early August an Us Weekly source: 'Scott and Sofia have simmered down a little and Scott has been making a big effort to refocus on himself and his family.'</p>

<p>By mid-August an E! News insider said: 'They have been off and on for two months. Sofia really pushed to make things work between them after they initially broke up, but Scott officially called it off recently and they are no longer speaking.'</p>

<p>Dashing as ever: The self-styled 'Lord' is seen smoldering in a recent Instagram snap that showed him horseback riding in Turks And Caicos with Kourtney's sister Kendall Jenner</p>

<p>Near the end of last month Scott publicly confirmed that Kourtney's sister Khloe was back with the father of her child, NBA heartthrob Tristan Thompson.</p>

<p>Khloe and Tristan, who share a two-year-old daughter called True, broke up in February 2019 but went into self-isolation together with their toddler this year.</p>

<p>Last month when Khloe posted some smoldering bikini shots to Instagram, Scott commented that Tristan 'is a lucky man.'</p>

<p>She left the basketball love rat last year after he shared a kiss at a party with Jordyn Woods, who was then best friends with Khloe's sister Kylie Jenner.</p>

<p>Making it happen: Scott has also been using his social media to promote his clothing line which he has cheekily named Talentless</p>

<p>Last year Jordyn went on her family friend Jada Pinkett Smith's show Red Table Talk and took a two-hour lie detector test to deny ever having sex with Tristan. </p>

<p>Khloe first began dating Tristan when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with his three-year-old firstborn son Prince. </p>

<p>Although Jordan has claimed she was still with Tristan when he took up with Khloe, Khloe insisted she thought he was single at the time.</p>
