<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A couple in New Zealand have been branded 'plague rats' after sharing a photo online bragging about how they refused to wear a mask on a public train.</p>

<p>Joachim Wanihi and his wife were commuting in Wellington on Monday when they were approached by a train guard about their lack of masks.</p>

<p>Mr Wanihi, in a post that has since gone viral, said he told the guard they were allowed to ride on the train despite not wearing a face covering before the officer walked away.</p>

<p>The couple were then approached by a policeman, who Mr Wanihi claimed offered them a mask before telling them to 'have a nice day' after they politely declined.</p>

<p>Masks are currently mandatory across all public transport in New Zealand under the COVID-19 alert level two restrictions. </p>

<p>Joachim Wanihi and his wife (pictured) have been slammed online after bragging about not wearing a mask while on a public train in Wellington</p>

<p>Mr Wanihi said he was offered a mask by a police officer but they politely declined on Monday</p>

<p>'Appreciate the Metlink staff &amp; NZ Police for their professional conduct in approaching us for not wearing masks on the train this morning,' Mr Wanihi wrote.</p>

<p>'The train guard asked if we knew it was mandatory to wear a mask? We said that we are aware the government website said we cannot be stopped from entering the train without wearing a mask. He was gracious and took our tickets.</p>

<p>'The police came on board and asked if we would like a mask? We thanked him but said no thank you. He smiled and said have a nice day.</p>

<p>'Know your rights, but don't be an a*****e. My wife pictured here basking in God's grace.'</p>

<p>But the couple have since been hit with a barrage of abuse online for putting other people's health at risk.</p>

<p>The couple were hit with criticism online after sharing the photo with many suggesting their behaviour would lead to them catching the virus</p>

<p>Other New Zealanders defended the couple and said they had done nothing wrong</p>

<p>'Filthy plague rats the both of you,' someone wrote.</p>

<p>'Please, just wear a mask. You aren't clever for not wearing one. Solidarity is easy, just put literally any fabric over your face and you're compliant,' said another.</p>

<p>'Your wife gonna meet god real soon don't worry,' one said. </p>

<p>'You're going to be wondering where that God is when one or both of you catch it.'</p>

<p>But other New Zealanders rushed to the defence of the 'selfish' couple.</p>

<p>'That's great they were being so kind and good on you guys for being respectful. My daughter did the same yesterday,' one commented.</p>

<p>'There are lots of people that can't wear masks do you wish it upon them also? If others on the train are wearing masks and these two are not sick what's the issue?' someone wrote.</p>

<p>Following his backlash, Mr Wanihi said he would be willing to speak to people about the issue at a public place - but added he would not be wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Police said it would take some time for New Zealanders to get used to the new rules that were enforced on Sunday night. </p>

<p>A man is seen wearing a compulsory face mask in Auckland on Monday (pictured) as they became compulsory</p>

<p>'We recognise this requirement is something new for many Kiwis and it's something people may not have been used to doing previously,' Assistant Commissioner Richard Chambers said.</p>

<p>'While these masks have been designed to be disposable, as part of our education approach it is hoped that it makes the idea of wearing a face covering become more familiar for the public.</p>

<p>'Our response to COVID-19 has been to work with the public first and remind them of what is required from them.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Wanihi, NZ Police and Metlink for comment. </p>

<p>From midnight on August 30, all of New Zealand was placed under alert level two restrictions.</p>

<p>This means residents can only gather in groups with a maximum of ten people and funerals are capped at 50.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern (pictured on Monday) said she was hopeful the new restrictions would prompt a drop in cases</p>

<p>Masks are mandatory on all forms of public transport and taxi and Uber drivers must also cover their faces.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern urged residents to wear a mask after a cluster of cases was traced back to a bus ride.</p>

<p>'Please wear them Auckland. If you go to a shop wear a mask, if you go to a mall, wear a mask. When you step out of your home we are asking you please wear a mask,' she said.</p>

<p>'This is one of the key ways we can protect you and those around you.'</p>

<p>The restrictions are expected to last until September 6.</p>
