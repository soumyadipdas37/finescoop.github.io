<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An elaborate police operation has bought down a network of county lines drug operations in and around London, with more than 200 people arrested. </p>

<p>Officers from nine police forces were drafted into the three-day campaign, code named Operation Pandilla.  </p>

<p>A number of 'extremely dangerous' criminals were among the 230 people arrested.</p>

<p>County lines is the term given to the phenomenon when drug gangs from big cities expand their sales to smaller towns, using violence to drive out local dealers.</p>

<p>The networks are known to exploite children and vulnerable people along the way. </p>

<p>The multi-force police operation used automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) to target vehicles used by vehicles to smuggle drugs on arterial routes and motorways. </p>

<p>Chief Inspector Jack May Robinson from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce said: 'Some of the individuals arrested are extremely dangerous, lead criminal lifestyles and exploit vulnerable people to run drugs and commit crime.' </p>

<p>Of the 230 arrests made, offences include attempted murder, possession with intent to supply class A and B drugs, possession of offensive weapons, possession of firearms, assault and possession of criminal property. </p>

<p>A stash of weapons, including 22 knives, was also seized, while 54 vehicles and 62 illegal items including drugs were conviscated. </p>

<p>Officers from nine police forces were drafted into the three-day campaign, code named Operation Pandilla</p>

<p>A total of 230 arrests were made and a stash of weapons, including 22 knives, was also seized. Police also conviscated 54 vehicles and 62 illegal items including drugs</p>

<p>Officers from the Metropolitan, Surrey, Kent, Essex, Hertfordshire, Thames Valley, Hampshire, City of London and British Transport Police were all involved in the complex operation. </p>

<p>Chief Inspector Robinson added: 'Due to the need to safeguard those who have been exploited, we resourced a dedicated phone line of trained officers to give specialist advice to officers to ensure the best care and response possible.</p>

<p>'Operation Pandilla is part of our effort to target the drivers of violent crime. </p>

<p>'Drugs are inextricably linked to a high proportion of the violence; therefore we will continue to target those who exploit children to peddle drugs and target the most vulnerable within our communities. </p>

<p>'We simply can't do this alone and must work with our partners.</p>

<p>'Our message to criminals using the road network to transport drugs and illegal assets is clear. We are tirelessly working 24/7 to disrupt you. </p>

<p>Chief Inspector Jack May Robinson from the Met's Violent Crime Taskforce said some of the individuals arrested were 'extremely dangerous'</p>

<p>'If you are stopped with anything illegal we will arrest you and put you before the courts. </p>

<p>'We are working stronger together and sharing intelligence across borders to make it as hard as possible for you to run county lines.'</p>

<p>County lines networks are growing alarmingly fast. In 2015, only seven police forces reported knowledge of county lines in their area.</p>

<p>By November 2017 there were 720 ‘lines’ or networks known to police; by the end of last year that number had risen to more than 2,000. </p>
