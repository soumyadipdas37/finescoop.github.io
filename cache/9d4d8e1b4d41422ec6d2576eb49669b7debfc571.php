<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donny van de Beek's youth team coach at Ajax insists his former protege moving to Real Madrid this summer would have been a 'disaster'. </p>

<p>The 23-year-old, who rose to prominence in the Ajax side which reached the 2019 Champions League semi-finals, completed a £40million move to Manchester United last week. </p>

<p>However, the Holland international was also closely linked with a move to the Bernabeu - with a deal reportedly agreed before the coronavirus pandemic - but van de Beek's youth coach Ruben Jongkind believes the move to United was the right decision. </p>

<p>Real Madrid were also heavily linked with Van de Beek before the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Van de Beek's youth coach, Ruben Jongkind (left), says Madrid move would've been a 'disaster'</p>

<p>'He [Van de Beek] will be challenged, the average age in the Premier League is probably around 26 or 27, but I think he has shown in European campaigns that he has enough skills to play at the highest level,' Jongkind told the Manchester Evening News. </p>

<p>'He likes a challenge and he has this mindset that he wants to go further every time. I think this is a better time than, for example, [Justin] Kluivert to AS Roma, that was too early.</p>

<p>'It is also a good club to move to. United have a history of bringing in youth players, I think it's a great choice, much better than Real Madrid, I think that would have been a disaster. </p>

<p>'The playing style is more akin to Donny at United than Real Madrid as well.'</p>

<p>Jongkind added that Van de Beek's talent in the Ajax academy was spotted over 10 years ago, when he was just playing in the Under-10s side. </p>

<p>Van de Beek is currently on international duty with Holland and played Poland on Friday </p>

<p>'It must have been in 2008 or 2009, I think he was playing in the Under-10s at the time,' he said. </p>

<p>'I was also involved with the younger age groups. He ended up being selected for Ajax and he was in the team of [Dennis] Bergkamp. </p>

<p>'After a short while we talked about him and Dennis said 'this player is going to be big so you have to work with him individually now'.  </p>
