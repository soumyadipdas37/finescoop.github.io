<p>Research conducted by the Australian National University and the University of Melbourne also shows there is insufficient evidence e-cigarettes help smokers quit.</p>

<p>Lead researcher Emily Banks says vaping could undermine a smoke-free start to life.</p>

<p>E-cigarettes triple non-smokers' chances of taking up smoking, a scientific study has found (file picture)</p>

<p>'We found clear evidence that non-smokers who use e-cigarettes are around three times as likely to take up conventional smoking as their peers who don't use e-cigarettes,' Professor Banks said on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'There are around 2.3million smokers in Australia, and it is our number one cause of premature death and disability.</p>

<p>'Avoiding e-cigarettes in non-smokers is vital to keeping progress going against smoking.'</p>

<p>The research was funded by the federal health department and has been handed to government.</p>

<p>Australia's health regulator last month formalised a ban on e-cigarettes and heated tobacco products.</p>

<p>Eleven per cent of Australian adults smoke daily but 97 per cent of 14 to 17 year olds have never tried a cigarette.</p>

<p>Researchers are concerned e-cigarettes could become a gateway to smoking for young people.</p>

<p>They could also make ex-smokers twice as likely to relapse.</p>

<p>'The evidence also indicates that e-cigarettes tend to lead to prolonged use of nicotine, rather than quitting the habit entirely,' Professor Banks said.</p>
