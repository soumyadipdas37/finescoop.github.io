<p>'Mia played rugby for the first time this week down at Minch', said Mike, 'She enjoyed it actually and she’s going to do football for the first time this weekend as well.</p>

<p>'She’s a chip off the old block. She just likes to truck it up, but we’ll work on that.' </p>

<p>Payne, 40, quizzed Mike: 'Is she quite formidable, does she have a bit of a formidable hand off?'. 'Yeah she’s quite aggressive', the father replied. </p>

<p>Pal James then interjected: 'That’s probably her mother', to which Mike replied: 'Yeah it’s a combination of both I think.'  </p>

<p>Mia has happily been back to school for months now, after the government gave the green light for Year One pupils to go back in June.</p>

<p>Zara and Mike and their children live on Princess Anne's Gatcombe Park estate in Gloucestershire, with Mia's school presumed to be close by. </p>

<p>Speaking about homeschooling and the difficult decision to send Mia Grace back into full-time education on ITV's Lorraine, Mike called the decision a 'no-brainer'. </p>

<p>'You weigh it up, the school she's at have done a fantastic job in how they've prepared', told Mike.</p>

<p>'She was ready to go back, she was missing her friends and missing that interaction.' </p>

<p>He said on her first day back, Mia Grace was delighted to see her classmates again: 'I'll always remember her face coming out the first day, she'd had a blast catching up with and seeing everyone. </p>

<p>'It was a bit of a no-brainer for us, in terms of not just her wellbeing and mental wellbeing, but for us, home-schooling... I think it was definitely needed.'  </p>

<p>Gatcombe is located in the heart of the Cotswolds, and is just a few miles away from Highgrove, Prince Charles' home in nearby Tetbury.</p>

<p>The Queen bought the Grade II-listed manor house for her only daughter and her then husband Captain Mark Phillips as a wedding present, and the couple moved in 1977 - and raised their two children, Peter and Zara, on the estate. </p>

<p>Both Zara and Mike have been doing their best to adapt to normal life once again, and recently both had a Covid-19 tests, to ensure they are safe to take part in social events. </p>

<p>Both were relieved the tests came back negative, and the Tindalls are believed to have since travelled to Balmoral to see the Queen.</p>

<p>Zara and Mike took the BioSure tests in their role as ambassadors for Manchester-based cyber technology company VST Enterprises.</p>

<p>They then uploaded their results onto their VHealth Passport - which has been developed to help get sports fans back into major events and stadiums - where they appeared within seconds. </p>

<p>The couple are taking part in a pilot scheme called FANS ARE BACK, which is being put to the government to get football, snooker, rugby, golf and equestrian sports fans back into stadiums and major sporting events next month.</p>
