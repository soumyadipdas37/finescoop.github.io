<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tony Mowbray praised 'single-minded' Adam Armstrong after he netted a hat-trick. Tyrhys Dolan also scored in his his first league start, before Derrick William added another.</p>

<p>Wycombe were reduced to 10 men following Darius Charles' dismissal, and their manager Gareth Ainsworth called it 'a bit of a lesson.'</p>

<p>Furious Sabri Lamouchi hammered his Nottingham Forest players after they crashed at home to Cardiff.</p>

<p>Blackburn Rovers hammered five past Wycombe Wanderers in a fruitful outing at Ewood Park</p>

<p>Rovers gave the Championship newcomers a rude awakening with a clinical performance</p>

<p>Forest have now gone eight league games without a win after Kieffer Moore's double helped Neil Harris's side to victory.</p>

<p>Lamouchi said: 'We started the game in absolutely the wrong way. It is just unacceptable to start the game like that, by winning absolutely no duels.</p>

<p>'We conceded a goal from the first corner. We had worked all week on dealing with long throw-ins, second balls and corners. Our marking was absolutely unacceptable.</p>

<p>'We conceded the second goal the first time they launched a long throw into the box. You can work all week, but if you are not focused and determined, when it comes to defending those things, you do not have a chance.</p>

<p>Nottingham Forest manager Sabri Lamouchi was furious with his side's latest defeat</p>

<p>'The second half was much better, because we did not play in the first half. But we have to do more. We have to be more solid, more strong.</p>

<p>'We were so soft, we made it so easy for the opponent. We need to find a solution to get out of this difficult situation.'</p>

<p>Cardiff boss Harris said: 'The team showed a great response to a little bit of criticism as we hadn't started the season very well. I thought the focus, the mentality, on and off the pitch, it came to fruition here, especially in the first half.' </p>

<p>Philip Cocu admitted the pressure was already on his Derby side after their defeat at Luton.</p>

<p>'It's the second game, but the pressure's on now as we don't have any points,' the Dutchman said.</p>

<p>Jordan Clark scored the late winner to make it two wins from two games for Luton in the Championship.</p>

<p>Luke Berry put the home in front midway through the first half, volleying in a fantastic Elliot Lee delivery.</p>

<p>Derby boss Philip Cocu admitted the pressure is already on his side after another defeat</p>

<p>Derby were soon level after the restart through Jack Marriott.</p>

<p>Luton boss Nathan Jones said: 'I'm delighted. I thought we were excellent, we really caused them problems pressing at the right times.'  </p>

<p>Swansea first team coach Alan Tate could yet face Football Association action for grabbing Birmingham midfielder Jon Toral by the throat at the Liberty Stadium.</p>

<p>'I didn't see anything because I was in the tunnel,' said Birmingham boss Aitor Karanka. 'I told the players to forget what happened.'</p>

<p>Swansea head coach Steve Cooper said: 'No dramas.' </p>

<p>Wednesday manager Garry Monk seemed satisfied with a point against Watford, despite Josh Windass and Dominic Iorfa spurning presentable opportunities for his side.</p>

<p>'We had the better of the first half and they had slightly the better of the second half,' he said. Watford head coach Vladimir Ivic agreed it was a fair result. </p>

<p>'First half, we didn't play well,' he said.  </p>

<p>New Reading manager Veljko Paunovic urged his team to 'stay humble' as they went to the top of the table after two games. </p>

<p>Sheffield Wednesday were left to rue wasted chances against newly-relegated Watford</p>

<p>Barnsley lost Polish defender Michal Helik to a red card, before Reading went ahead through subtitute Yakou Meite.</p>

<p>Mads Andersen, Barnsley's other centre back, was also sent off, before Michael Olise made it safe for Reading.</p>

<p>An opportunistic goal from Jed Wallace sealed the points for Millwall as he snapped up the game's big chance.  </p>

<p>Wallace seized on a mistake by Michael Ihiekwe, who let a through-ball slide under his foot, before rounding Jamal Blackman and tapping home into an empty net.</p>

<p>Millwall manager Gary Rowett said: 'We got a little bit of fortune with the goal.'</p>

<p>Norwich manager Daniel Farke paid tribute to his side's small group of fans at Carrow Road.</p>

<p>'It certainly felt that there were more than 1,000 fans here, that's for sure,' said the City boss. 'Having supporters helped us a lot.'</p>

<p>After going behind to an early Scott Sinclair penalty, Norwich levelled when Teemu Pukki netted his first goal from open play since the tail end of last year.</p>

<p>Preston again got their noses in front when defender Darnell Fisher netted just but Norwich refused to lie down and made sure they went away with a point when substitute Przemslaw Placheta fired home a second equaliser. </p>
