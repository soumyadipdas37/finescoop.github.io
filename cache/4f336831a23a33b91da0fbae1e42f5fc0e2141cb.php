<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The success of Melbourne's ongoing lockdown could be at risk with a new cluster emerging in the southeast of the city, testing the capacity of COVID-detectives.</p>

<p>There are currently 101 active coronavirus cases in the Casey and Dandenong area with 34 infections linked to five households in the Afghan community.</p>

<p>As residents in the city are still under strict Stage Four lockdown which restricts families travelling more than 5km from their homes to visit other households, it's thought the infected group may have breached the stay-at-home orders.</p>

<p>Health authorities are now scrambling to track and trace the new surge in cases and the Victorian government has even began a new recruitment drive that will see retired officers re-enlisted to bolster the state's frontline virus efforts. </p>

<p>There are currently 101 active coronavirus cases in the Casey and Dandenong area with 34 infections linked to five households</p>

<p>The Victorian government has even began a new recruitment drive that will see retired officers re-enlisted to bolster the state's frontline virus efforts</p>

<p>'Members of those households visiting other households,' Department of Health and Human Services COVID-19 testing commander Jeroen Weimar said.</p>

<p>'It is that limited amount of contact, relatively infrequent contact between these five households that has now meant that we have 34 people in five houses experiencing or living with a very real threat of the coronavirus.'</p>

<p>The cluster, which has impacted the five households in Hallam, Clyde, Narre Warren South and Cranbourne North, first emerged on September 4. </p>

<p>Cases in the southeast have now spread to Dandenong Police Station and a number of industrial work sites.</p>

<p>Premier Daniel Andrews on Friday said the actions of the family's involved in the cluster is 'disappointing'. </p>

<p>The cluster which has impacted the five households in Hallam, Clyde, Narre Warren South and Cranbourne North, first emerged on September 4</p>

<p>'Five kilometres is one thing and visiting others is the real issue here.' he said. </p>

<p>'The rules are in place for a reason and anyone who undermines this, undermines the entire strategy and it means the rules will be on for longer.' </p>

<p>But the Victorian leader ruled out fines for the group, telling reporters it may discourage others from being completely honest with contact tracers. </p>

<p>'I know many Victorians, when you see examples of people not following the rules, that's disappointing, it makes you angry,' Mr Andrews said.</p>

<p>'You need to look at the bigger picture here.</p>

<p>'We don't want a situation where people don't have a sense of confidence and indeed, you know, the sense they're obliged to tell us the full story as quickly as possible. That's what we need.' </p>

<p>Despite the new cluster, Victoria's overall case numbers are continuing to decline.</p>

<p>There were 45 new cases on Friday bringing the total number of infections above 20,000.</p>

<p>However the number of active cases has fallen to 920.</p>

<p>Sadly, another five deaths today takes Victoria's death toll to 750. </p>

<p>With contact tracers 'painstakingly' working around the clock to slow the spread of the virus and bringing the city out of lockdown, the Victorian government is set to introduce a controversial new policy that will see retired cops re-enlisted in the force.</p>

<p>The Department of Justice and Community Safety and the Department of Health and Human Services is behind the push that will see former cops given paid training before being assigned specific COVID-19 roles including, industry enforcement, testing support, door-knocking and the airport patrol. </p>

<p>But not everyone is in favour of the move to bring back veteran police.     </p>

<p>'Police veterans have a real contribution to make to the ongoing safety of the community but their use to issue infringements, detain people and conduct checks on private property is entirely inappropriate,' Opposition Police &amp; Community Safety spokesman David Southwick told the Herald Sun.   </p>

<p>Ivan Ray, who served in the Victorian Police Force for over three decades said it's a recipe for disaster for the veterans. </p>

<p>'It's effectively a health department police force, and we know the Health Department is no good at enforcement, we saw that in the hotel quarantine operation,' Mr Ray said.</p>

<p>'Veterans can play a part and they can support policing, but it has to be by the police department,' he said. </p>

<p>Health authorities are urging anyone in the southeast of Melbourne to diligently monitor their health and immediately get tested if feeling unwell. </p>
