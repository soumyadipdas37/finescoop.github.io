<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The public address system demanded spectators wear face masks or risk expulsion from the Sochi Autodrom. </p>

<p>This being Russia, the instruction was met with stony defiance. Covid? What Covid? A crowd of some 20,000 over the weekend represented the biggest in Europe since the virus grabbed sport by the throat. </p>

<p>The cafes and bars that have proliferated since I first came here for the Winter Olympics six years ago were teeming with people for whom social distancing is as foreign a concept as moonwalking. </p>

<p>Around 20,000 fans were in attendance across the weekend at the Russian Grand Prix</p>

<p>It was the biggest crowd in Europe since coronavirus' considerable impact on sport</p>

<p>Yes, it all felt a bit different after most of the season has run without fans. The first, a smattering, returned for the Tuscan Grand Prix a fortnight ago. But this was on a different scale and, putting aside a cavalier approach to precautions, it was warming to hear the cheers and see Union flags in the stands. </p>

<p>For Formula One bosses, there is slight apprehension, though their tracking system should ensure the circus can move on to Germany and safer territory on October 11.  </p>

<p>The season is a miracle of deliverance for F1 as of all the sports, none presents bigger logistical challenges. In all, 47,357 tests over three months have produced just 16 positives. But there was an uptick around this race — seven positives: three caught prior to travel and four locals. </p>

<p>There has been talk of testing at the track being cursory — a quick prod up the nose rather than the brain-tickling rigour we have grown used to. Regardless, I am armed with a form that tells me I am negative — and that will get me back home.     </p>

<p>Formula One fans watched on as Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas reigned supreme in Sochi</p>
