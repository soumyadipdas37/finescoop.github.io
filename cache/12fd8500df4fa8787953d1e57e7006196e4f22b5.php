<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jon Cryer sparked an unexpected Twitter feud with Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz on Saturday after revealing he donated to his political rival.</p>

<p>The spat began Saturday after Cryer, 55, took a swipe at Gaetz in a tweet announcing that he donated money to Democrat Phil Ehr.</p>

<p>'Rep. Matt Gaetz invited a white supremacist to the State of the Union, attempted to intimidate a federal witness, and endorsed a sociopathic bigot who applauded the deaths of migrants for congress,' wrote Cryer.</p>

<p>'I just donated to his opponent [Phil Ehr],' he added.</p>

<p>On blast: Celebrities came to the defense of Two and a Half Men alum Jon Cryer (L) following his Twitter tirade against Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz (R) on Saturday</p>

<p>Three reasons: The feud was sparked after the 55-year-old native New Yorker announced he donated to the 38-year-old Republican politician's Democratic opponent Phil Ehrin</p>

<p>Six hours later, the 38-year-old GOP politician responded on Twitter with a pointed criticism of Cryer's acting career.  </p>

<p>'Charlie Sheen totally carried two and a half men,' Gaetz, 38, wrote.</p>

<p>Cryer and Charlie Sheen, 55, both held lead roles in the popular sitcom, Two and a Half Men. when it debuted on CBS in 2003.</p>

<p>The award-winning series continued with much of its original cast until 2011, when Sheen was fired over his 'dangerously self-destructive conduct,' inflammatory comments about producers and because he became difficult to work with.   </p>

<p>Sheen, who was the highest paid actor on American television, was admitted to a rehabilitation facility. Ashton Kutcher was hired in Sheen's absence. </p>

<p>Gaetz directly responded to Cryer by making a reference to his former onscreen brother: 'Charlie Sheen totally carried two and a half men'</p>

<p>At that, Jon replied: 'Is that why, after he left, it lasted for 4 more years and I won an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy?'</p>

<p>In response to Gaetz, Cryer boasted his accolades and noted the franchise's success after Sheen's dismissal temporarily halted production.</p>

<p>'Is that why, after he left, it lasted for 4 more years and I won an Emmy for Best Actor in a Comedy?' wrote Cryer.</p>

<p>In fact, Cryer received two Emmy Awards for his portrayal of struggling chiropractor Alan Harper in all 262 episodes of the 12-year sitcom.</p>

<p>Two and a Half Men: Technically, Cryer received two Emmy Awards for his portrayal of struggling chiropractor Alan Harper in all 262 episodes of the CBS sitcom, which aired for 12 seasons between 2003–2015</p>

<p>Cryer added in a separate tweet that his dig at Gaetz was not an insult to Sheen or his talent.</p>

<p>'And FWIW, this wasn’t meant as a slam on Charlie,' Cryer said. ' </p>

<p>'He was undeniably the star of the show. And a fantastic actor. Despite his issues, we had many more highs than lows.</p>

<p>'But you can’t say he “carried” a show that lasted four years without him.'</p>

<p>Gaetz attempted to belittle Cryer's awards, writing back:  'What's an Emmy? An award Hollywood gives itself? I win elections.' </p>

<p>The Donald Trump defender then belittled Jon's Emmy wins by replying: 'What's an Emmy? An award Hollywood gives itself? I win elections'</p>

<p>'He was undeniably the star of the show': Cryer stressed that Matt 'can't say [Sheen] "carried" a show that lasted four years without him,' but clarified he wasn't underplaying his disgraced 55-year-old ex-castmate's talents</p>

<p>The pair's Twitter spat would eventually trend on the social media sight, prompting others to come in defense of Cryer.  </p>

<p>Comedian Patton Oswalt re-tweeted the feud and hilariously referred to Cryer's 1986 breakout role as Philip 'Duckie' Dalekie in Pretty in Pink, cracking: 'Don't. F***. With. Duckie.'</p>

<p>Star Wars legend Mark Hamill also showed his support for Cryer by re-tweeting the exchange.</p>

<p>'This is the moment when Matt Gaetz decided to show that in addition to being a loathsome person, he is also a dreadful television critic,' wrote Hamil.</p>

<p>'Thumbs down. Jon Cryer for the WIN!!! Thumbs up.'</p>

<p>Comedian Patton Oswalt then re-tweeted the feud and hilariously referred to Jon's 1986 breakout role as Philip 'Duckie' Dalekie in Pretty in Pink, cracking: 'Don't. F***. With. Duckie'</p>

<p>'In addition to being a loathsome person, he is also a dreadful television critic': Star Wars legend Mark Hamill also showed his support for Cryer by re-tweeting the exchange</p>

<p>Cryer - who endorsed John McCain for president in 2008 - will next reprise his recurring role as supervillain Lex Luthor in the sixth season of Supergirl, which premieres 'midseason 2021' on The CW.</p>

<p>But this isn't the first time that Gaetz has gotten into a virtual argument with a celebrity on Twitter. </p>

<p>In June, he was criticized by actor Ron Perlman, of the series Sons of Anarchy,' for saying he'd rather have no US Soccer team, 'than have a soccer team that won't stand for the National Anthem.'</p>
