<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joey Barton seldom disappoints when it comes to a colourful comment.</p>

<p>Whether a considered viewpoint on current affairs or an amusing anecdote, Barton the manager is similar to Barton the player in not holding back.</p>

<p>And as his Fleetwood Town side prepare to face his boyhood club Everton in the third round of the Carabao Cup this week, Barton certainly didn't disappoint.</p>

<p>Joey Barton is proving himself as a manager at League One Fleetwood Town, who host his boyhood club Everton in the Carabao Cup third round on Wednesday night</p>

<p>Barton (circled) played in Everton's academy teams between the ages of eight and 16 before the club released him for being too small </p>

<p>He was speaking about the struggle to convince his eight-year-old son Cassius to support Everton when Liverpool are winning Premier League and Champions League titles.</p>

<p>'He asked me to get a Liverpool shirt so I refused to get him one,' Barton said ahead of Wednesday night's game at Highbury Stadium.</p>

<p>'I said, 'mate, I can't get you a Liverpool shirt' so his mum went out and bought him one.</p>

<p>'She has gone the shop and she has said what name do you want on the top and he has said 'Firmino'.</p>

<p>'So she has got the No 9 and the name on the top but she had spelt it 'FER-' so he has come back with this Liverpool top with FERMINO on the back…</p>

<p>'I let it go and then my brother came in and said, 'You have spelt Firmino wrong on the back of his kit' and I said,' that is what happens when you are a Liverpudlian.'</p>

<p>Barton still adores Everton but will be aiming to give Carlo Ancelotti a headache here </p>

<p>Everton - inspired by Colombian summer signing James Rodriguez (middle) - have enjoyed a bright start to the season with three consecutive wins</p>

<p>Lifelong Evertonian Barton, 38, clearly can't resist a little dig at the team from Anfield but it's his own footballing love he wants to give a bloody nose to.</p>

<p>Three wins out of three at the beginning of the campaign, off the back of the summer signing of Colombian star James Rodriguez, have raised hopes Carlo Ancelotti can drag Everton out the doldrums.</p>

<p>As much as Barton will want his League One upstarts to dump the Toffees out the cup, he'll be thrilled if they enjoy a successful season.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Huyton, all Barton's family were Everton fans and when the club scouted him aged eight or nine, it was a dream come true.</p>

<p>But Everton released Barton at the age of 16 on the grounds that he was too small to make it was a midfielder. 'I was f***ing gutted, I went home that night in bits,' as he has recalled.</p>

<p>Barton's inner steel meant he was never going to give up on a footballing career and he went on to play for Manchester City, Newcastle United, QPR, Marseille, Burnley and Rangers, as well as winning a solitary England cap.</p>

<p>Barton did go on to carve out a top level career despite Everton's rejection and certainly wasn't a shrinking violet on the field</p>

<p>Barton squares up to Sunderland's Phil Bardsley during his time as a Newcastle player</p>

<p>But with a rap sheet lengthier than the majority of players - including two convictions for charges of violence and three FA charges for violent conduct - he certainly didn't seem to make a natural manager.</p>

<p>Yet for all the moments of madness, Barton is highly intelligent and has never been afraid to speak his mind.</p>

<p>He's criticised UKIP on Question Time, addressed the Oxford Union, discussed Friedrich Nietzsche on Twitter, is well versed in the works of George Orwell (which he once used in a broadside against the FA) and studied philosophy at the University of Roehampton.</p>

<p>And far from deleting his Twitter account and website when he moved into management with Fleetwood two years ago, or succumb to blandness, Barton still speaks his mind on the issues of the day in sport and beyond.</p>

<p>Turns out he's an astute coach as well. A football obsessive, he once studied matches from the Paraguayan third division because a coach there had come up with some novel tactics.</p>

<p>Barton receives a red card during Fleetwood's game against Wycombe last season</p>

<p>Barton hasn't toned down his forthright views on Twitter since moving into management</p>

<p>In his first season in charge, Fleetwood finished 11th in League One, an improvement of three positions on the previous year.</p>

<p>Last season, Barton improved things further and Fleetwood finished sixth to make the play-offs, eventually rescheduled for early July.</p>

<p>They were well beaten by Wycombe Wanderers in the end but even having a shot at promotion to the Championship is remarkable for a club of Fleetwood's stature.</p>

<p>Despite the maverick tendencies, the Cod Army have warmed to Barton. TV cameras picked out a cardboard cut-out of Barton in red Baywatch trunks holding up a giant fish in the empty stands during the play-off semi-final.</p>

<p>Barton is set to star in a fly-on-the-wall Sky documentary about his time in charge of Fleetwood.</p>

<p>Fleetwood fans placed a cardboard cut-out of Barton in Baywatch gear on the terraces</p>

<p>Inevitably, there have been indiscretions. He was handed a one-match touchline ban for abusing officials when a Ched Evans goal was disallowed for offside at Bristol Rovers in December 2019.</p>

<p>And in February, he received a two-match touchline ban after being sent off for another rant at officials at Wycombe.</p>

<p>More seriously, Barton allegedly assaulted then Barnsley manager Daniel Stendel following a match in April 2019, causing the German to chip his teeth.</p>

<p>Barton pleaded not guilty to a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm with the hearing delayed a year until June 2021 because of Covid-19.</p>

<p>While that will continue to hang over Barton, he has received wholesome praise from other managers.</p>

<p>Police blocked Barton's car and prevented him from leaving Oakwell after the 2019 incident</p>

<p>Wycombe boss Gareth Ainsworth said before their play-off meeting: 'People judge Joey on other things more than football, and although he has this passion that can run over sometimes, he has done an incredible job.</p>

<p>'This is not a love-fest between me and Joey. But for someone to get into the play-off for the Championship in his second full season is a great achievement and sometimes gets overlooked because of other news issues surrounding Joey.'</p>

<p>His stock as a manager is only likely to grow. Especially if he springs a surprise on the club he's adored his whole life.</p>
