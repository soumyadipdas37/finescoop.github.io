<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A 'hot Jupiter' exoplanet with a surface temperature hot enough to vaporise iron has been dubbed 'one of the most extreme planets in the universe' by astronomers.</p>

<p>Using data from the European Space Agency CHEOPS space telescope, astronomers from the University of Bern studied the orbit, size and temperature of WASP-189b.</p>

<p>The planet, 322 light years from Earth, was first discovered orbiting its bright host star HD 133112 by the Wide Angle Search for Planets (WASP) project in 2018.</p>

<p>CHEOPS was launched by ESA eight months ago to characterise known exoplanets and WASP-189b is the first planet examined by the orbiting spaceship.  </p>

<p>The gas giant planet is one and a half times the size of Jupiter and has a surface temperature of 5,792 degrees Fahrenheit - it takes just three days to orbit its star.    </p>

<p>This is an artist impression of WASP-189b orbiting its extremely hot 'blue' host star. The planet orbits the star every three days and has a permanent day and night side</p>

<p>This is an earlier artist impression of HD133112 and WASP-189b shared by NASA before the full extent of its ultra-hot surface were known</p>

<p>The star, named HD 133112, is the hottest star known to have a planetary system, according to the Swiss astronomers behind the CHEOPS discovery.  </p>

<p>Monika Lendl, lead author of the study from the University of Geneva said WASP-189b was particularly interesting as it is a close orbiting gas giant. </p>

<p>It orbits its star 20 times closer than the Earth orbits the Sun and is 'very exotic' as it has a permanent day side always exposed to the light of its 'very bright' host star. </p>

<p>Its climate is completely different from that of the gas giants Jupiter and Saturn in our solar system which have different sides facing the Sun as they rotate.</p>

<p>'Based on the observations using CHEOPS, we estimate the temperature of WASP-189b to be 3,200 degrees Celsius [5792 F]. </p>

<p>In comparison, Jupiter has an average temperature of -234 degrees Fahrenheit. </p>

<p>'Planets like WASP-189b are called 'ultra-hot Jupiters'. Iron melts at such a high temperature, and even becomes gaseous. This object is one of the most extreme planets we know so far,' says Lendl.</p>

<p>The planet itself is too close to the host star for any direct detection methods - so other techniques were needed to study it in more detail, the team explained.  </p>

<p>As the planet is so close to its host star the dayside is so bright the team were able to measure the 'missing light' as it passes behind the star - called an occultation.</p>

<p>'We observed several such occultations of WASP-189b with CHEOPS,' Lendl says. </p>

<p>'It appears that the planet does not reflect a lot of starlight. Instead, most of the starlight gets absorbed by the planet, heating it up and making it shine.' </p>

<p>The researchers believe that the planet is not very reflective because there are no clouds present on its dayside.</p>

<p>The system featuring WASP-189b is 'very exotic' according to astronomers. The star is very hot - 3,600 F hotter than the Sun - and the planet orbits the star every three days</p>

<p>'This is not surprising, as theoretical models tell us that clouds cannot form at such high temperatures,' said Willy Benz, study co-author from the University of Bern.</p>

<p>'We also found that the transit of the gas giant in front of its star is asymmetrical. This happens when the star possesses brighter and darker zones on its surface.'</p>

<p>CHEOPS is the shortened name for ESA's CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite mission.</p>

<p>It is the first mission dedicated to studying bright, nearby stars that are already known to host exoplanets.</p>

<p>It will make high-precision observations of the planet's size as it passes in front of its host star.</p>

<p>It will focus on planets in the super-Earth to Neptune size range, with its data enabling the bulk density of the planets to be derived. </p>

<p>Cheops is the first small, or S-class, mission in ESA’s science programme.</p>

<p> It is a partnership between ESA and Switzerland, with a dedicated Consortium led by the University of Bern, and with important contributions from 10 other ESA Member States.</p>

<p>The first planet studied by CHEOPS was WASP-189b - an ultra hot Jupiter planet orbiting its star every three days.</p>

<p>'Thanks to CHEOPS data, we can conclude that the star itself rotates so quickly that its shape is no longer spherical; but ellipsoidal. The star is being pulled outwards at its equator.' continues Benz.</p>

<p>The star around which WASP-189b orbits is very different from our Sun - it is considerably larger and more than 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit hotter.  </p>

<p>Because it is so hot, the star appears blue and not yellow-white like the sun. </p>

<p>Willy Benz said: 'Only a handful of planets are known to orbit such hot stars, and this system is the brightest by far.' </p>

<p>'The star itself is interesting – it's not perfectly round, but larger and cooler at its equator than at the poles, making the poles of the star appear brighter,' says Lendl. </p>

<p>'It's spinning around so fast that it's being pulled outwards at its equator! Adding to this asymmetry is the fact that WASP-189 b's orbit is inclined; it doesn't travel around the equator, but passes close to the star's poles.' </p>

<p>This tilted orbit adds to the existing mystery of how hot Jupiters form - for a planet to have such an inclined orbit it must have formed further out and been pushed inwards towards the star, the astronomers explained. </p>

<p>This is thought to happen as multiple planets within a system jostle for position, or as an external influence – another star, for instance – disturbs the system, pushing gas giants towards their star and onto very short orbits that are highly tilted. </p>

<p>'As we measured such a tilt with CHEOPS, this suggests that WASP-189 b has undergone such interactions in the past,' adds Lendl. </p>

<p>As a consequence, it forms a benchmark for further studies, the team explained - saying they expect further spectacular findings on exoplanets from CHEOPS.  </p>

<p>The CHEOPS mission was launched in 2019 as a 'follow up tool' to study known exoplanets in more detail and characterise their orbits and temperature</p>

<p>CHEOPS uses two methods to study exoplanets: Transit - detection of the dimming of a star as a planet passes in front of it, and occultation - when a planet passes behind a star and light reflected by the planet is obscured</p>

<p>'This first result from Cheops is hugely exciting: it is early definitive evidence that the mission is living up to its promise in terms of precision and performance,' says Kate Isaak, Cheops project scientist at ESA.</p>

<p>Thousands of exoplanets have been discovered since 1995 and many more are expected to be found in the coming years - from space and ground-based missions. </p>

<p>'Cheops has a unique 'follow-up' role to play in studying such exoplanets,' explained Isaak, adding it will search for transits of planets that have been discovered on the ground and more precisely measure their sizes. </p>

<p>'By tracking exoplanets on their orbits with Cheops, we can make a first-step characterisation of their atmospheres and determine the presence and properties of any clouds present,' Isaak added.</p>

<p>The research has been published in the journal of Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p>

<p>Distant stars and their orbiting planets often have conditions unlike anything we see in our atmosphere. </p>

<p>To understand these new world's, and what they are made of, scientists need to be able to detect what their atmospheres consist of.  </p>

<p>They often do this by using a telescope similar to Nasa's Hubble Telescope.</p>

<p>These enormous satellites scan the sky and lock on to exoplanets that Nasa think may be of interest. </p>

<p>Here, the sensors on board perform different forms of analysis. </p>

<p>One of the most important and useful is called absorption spectroscopy. </p>

<p>This form of analysis measures the light that is coming out of a planet's atmosphere. </p>

<p>Every gas absorbs a slightly different wavelength of light, and when this happens a black line appears on a complete spectrum. </p>

<p>These lines correspond to a very specific molecule, which indicates it's presence on the planet. </p>

<p>They are often called Fraunhofer lines after the German astronomer and physicist that first discovered them in 1814.</p>

<p>By combining all the different wavelengths of lights, scientists can determine all the chemicals that make up the atmosphere of a planet. </p>

<p>The key is that what is missing, provides the clues to find out what is present.  </p>

<p>It is vitally important that this is done by space telescopes, as the atmosphere of Earth would then interfere. </p>

<p>Absorption from chemicals in our atmosphere would skew the sample, which is why it is important to study the light before it has had chance to reach Earth. </p>

<p>This is often used to look for helium, sodium and even oxygen in alien atmospheres.  </p>

<p>This diagram shows how light passing from a star and through the atmosphere of an exoplanet produces Fraunhofer lines indicating the presence of key compounds such as sodium or helium </p>
