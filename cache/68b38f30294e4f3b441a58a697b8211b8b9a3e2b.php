<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The greatest first round in boxing history, by common consent, took place at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas in 1985. Marvin Hagler and Thomas Hearns battered each other to a standstill for three minutes of swinging hooks, shuddering upper cuts and brutal combinations. When the commentator caught his breath, he summed up what he had seen. ‘There has been no boxing, just fighting here,’ he said.</p>

<p>At Anfield on Saturday, we were privileged to see one of the best first day games of any English football season. There was no boxing, just fighting. There was no defending – or none that interfered much - just attacking. There was no caution. It was all thrown to the wind. There was no timidity, just daring. Liverpool, the champions, and newly-promoted Leeds went at it like two of the great clubs of the English game and it was beautiful.</p>

<p>It was a seven-goal thriller, a spectacle that would have graced any opening day and quite a way for Leeds coach Marcelo Bielsa to announce his eccentric genius to the Premier League.</p>

<p>Leeds, returning to the top flight for the first time in 16 years, played with the kind of boldness and determination to entertain that few sides attempt here at this fortress and there were times when Liverpool seemed taken aback by the impudence of their opponents. </p>

<p>It's a winning start for Liverpool, but despite picking up no points, keep an eye on Leeds United this year - they are not going straight back down if they keep up performances like that.</p>

<p>1988 - Mohamed Salah is the first <?php echo e('@'); ?>LFC player to score a hat-trick on MD1 of a league season since John Aldridge against Charlton in 1988-89. Magic. pic.twitter.com/pI1YzYcywf</p>

<p>Well, nothing is permanent in this game and after some clowning around at the back from both teams, it is Liverpool who can count themselves slightly fortunate to get their title defence off to a winning start. </p>

<p>Their rivals this season will have watched with curiosity this evening though. Still let's not get too far ahead of ourselves, it is only the opening day.</p>

<p>90+1min: We are now into four added minutes as Liverpool engage in keep-ball. Make no mistake though, Jurgen Klopp will have serious concerns following this performance this evening.</p>

<p>89min: Ultra defensive now from Jurgen Klopp as Joel Matip replaces Trent Alexander-Arnold. This does seem like it will be a rather harsh result on Leeds.</p>

<p>88min: And to the rescue comes Mohamed Salah who with two-spot kicks now completes his opening day hat-trick with his latest penalty. Nerves of steel.</p>

<p>87min: Awful from Rodrigo whose lazy challenge brings down Fabinho in the penalty box.</p>

<p>85min: Liverpool continue to apply pressure but they are not looking very dangerous with the ball. They have had few shots on target in this game and in truth are not really worrying the Leeds defence.</p>

<p>82min: Still Liverpool press for a fourth goal as Leeds make a change, with Jamie Shackleton replacing second half hero Mateusz Klich.</p>

<p>79min: Virgil van Dijk thinks he has restored Liverpool's lead after lashing home from close range following a corner, but the goal is ruled out for a foul by Curtis Jones on a Leeds defender.</p>

<p>76min: Roberto Firmino is booked for a deliberate foul on Jack Harrison around 25 yards out and Leeds nearly take a shock lead, with Kalvin Phillips curling just wide beyond an outstretched Alisson.</p>

<p>3 - Leeds are the first promoted side to score 3+ goals away at the reigning champions in the Premier League since Hull lost 3-4 vs Man Utd in November 2008. Fearless. pic.twitter.com/6LRwOeRYui</p>

<p>72min: Mohamed Salah is on an opening day hat-trick but even his shooting had gone a bit wayward in this half as he volleys way over the bar latching onto a loose ball inside the box.</p>

<p>69min: Just when we were starting to think this match was not going anywhere. Liverpool have been on top for much of this half but have offered very little threat. They are really going to have to step up another level to take the lead for a fourth time.</p>

<p>66min: The game comes alive again! Mateusz Klich collects a neat pass inside thee box before lashing a third equaliser for Marcelo Bielsa's side.</p>

<p>Moments earlier, Reds skipper Jordan Henderson made way for Curtis Jones.</p>

<p>62min: Double change for Leeds as Pablo Hernandez and Patrick Bamford make way for Rodrigo and Tyler Roberts</p>

<p>59min: The long ball is really causing Liverpool problems. Jack Harrison is marginally offside as he runs onto one past the backline, and after lobbing Alisson it leads to Trent Alexander-Arnold embarrassingly heading into his own goal.</p>

<p>The offside flag though spares him blushes as Liverpool send on Fabinho for Naby Keita.</p>

<p>56min: Approaching the hour mark and Leeds have yet to make a mark on this second half. They are keen to press the Reds, would they play any other way? But the chances are not coming.</p>

<p>53min: Liverpool are still controlling the play as they win successive corners. Trent Alexander-Arnold whips a ball to the back post but Virgil van Dijk can only power a header over the bar.</p>

<p>50min: Thought this had goal written all over it. Roberto Firmino cuts the ball back to Georginio Wijnaldum inside the box but he can only fire straight at Illan Meslier.</p>

<p>48min: Liverpool are on the front foot but no chances for the Reds yet as they look to establish a two-goal leads.</p>

<p>With maybe a few words from the coaches to knock a few defensive heads together, we may not see another five goals in this half, but let's see how it plays out at Anfield.</p>

<p>It was his handball that led to the flood of early goals, but I have done him a slight disservice regarding his defending for it.</p>

<p>I thought the ball clearly struck him on the arm but it did actually deflect onto his arm from his knee. Looks a very harsh spot-kick to be awarded in that light.</p>

<p>5 - This is only the second ever <?php echo e('@'); ?>premierleague game played on the opening matchday of a season to see five goals scored before half-time, after Man Utd 5-1 Fulham in August 2006 (4-1 at half-time). Entertainment. pic.twitter.com/fbnm1UEbMS</p>

<p>45+1min: Into two added minutes of what has been an absorbing first half. Excellent watch.</p>

<p>43min: What I do want to stress is this is not one way-traffic. Leeds have looked very confident attacking at Anfield and are denied a penalty kick after Helder Costa goes down tin the box under a Mohamed Salah challenge. Looked more like a dive to me and VAR agrees, well as far as it agrees it is not a penalty kick.</p>

<p>40min: No goals in over seven minutes. That's effectively a drought for this game. Liverpool perhaps wary their defence is a load of nonsense right now are pushing for a fourth goal as Sadio Mane has a shot deflected behind.</p>

<p>2 - Virgil van Dijk has made two errors leading directly to a goal in his last four Premier League games, more than he registered in his first 154 appearances in the competition (1). Lapse. pic.twitter.com/4F1RSdEw2Y</p>

<p>33min: In relative terms of this game, this isn't one you can put down to 'terrible defending', rather than it is a great finish from Mohamed Salah.</p>

<p>From a Liverpool free-kick he picks up a clearance on the edge of the box with his first touch, before blasting home into the near post top corner with his second.</p>

<p>30min: This game... mind blowing. Even Virgil van Dijk appears to have lost his defensive mind this evening, lazily trying to flick away a long ball only for Patrick Bamford to intercept and scoop a finish past the onrushing Alisson.</p>

<p>...but Roberto Firmino just cannot resist a jumping roundhouse kick can he?</p>

<p>23min: I do refer to both teams when talking about defending (or lack of it) by the way. Straight away Leeds have a one-on-one from kick-off, with Patrick Bamford released on goal. He takes the ball past Alisson but runs out of space before he can shoot and the chance peters out.</p>

<p>20min: Defending? Forget it. Not interested today. Liverpool restore their lead, with Virgil van Dijk heading home Andy Robertson's corner in front of Koch, who has not had a great Premier League debut for Leeds United.</p>

<p>15min: The start to this game has been nuts! Now Liverpool have the ball in the net again, but with Sadio Mane lobbing Illan Meslier, who had come off his line to intercept a long ball, the offside flag is correctly raised against the forward.</p>

<p>12min: Crikey, welcome back Leeds! Jack Harrison cuts inside past one of the best right-backs in Trent Alexander-Arnold like he is an average Joe, dodges past Joe Gomez and before Virgil van Dijk can cut across to save the day the midfielder blasts an effort into the bottom corner of Alisson's near post.</p>

<p>9min: Leeds United have responded well, even finding the net through Helder Costa but his goal is correctly ruled out for offside.</p>

<p>4min: For the fourth Premier League season in a row, Mohamed Salah scores on the opening day by blasting his penalty down the middle, a record he now holds along with Teddy Sheringham, whose record goes back from 1992-1995.</p>

<p>Mohamed Salah's shot strikes the loose arm of Leeds defender Robin Koch and Liverpool have a great chance to get off to a perfect start.</p>

<p>Still no fans to greet the teams of course, a bit of a shame considering Liverpool's status as new champions and Leeds' return.</p>

<p>Here are a reminder of the teams and formations:</p>

<p>Liverpool: Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Keita, Salah, Firmino, Mane.Subs: Fabinho, Milner, Adrian, Jones, Minamino, Origi, Matip.</p>

<p>Leeds: Meslier, Ayling, Koch, Struijk, Dallas, Phillips, Helder Costa, Hernandez, Klich, Harrison, Bamford.Subs: Rodrigo, Poveda-Ocampo, Alioski, Roberts, Casilla, Shackleton, Casey.</p>

<p>Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland)</p>

<p>Just the two games have been played today already, with Arsenal winning 3-0 at another promoted side in Fulham while Crystal Palace have defeated Southampton 1-0.</p>

<p>There will be four games today, with West Ham United hosting Newcastle United later on.</p>

<p>Which after 16 years away was always going to be the case. But how does it all break down, here is a neat little graphic from sportingindex showing that despite the vast difference in Premier League and international experience, this Leeds team still costs more. The wonders of inflation (and the Premier League boom since 2004).</p>

<p>7 - This is the seventh time in the <?php echo e('@'); ?>premierleague that the reigning champions have faced a newly-promoted side at home on the opening day, with the title-holders winning all six of the previous games. Opener. #LIVLEE pic.twitter.com/s22IcxsW1c</p>

<p>That of course is the new Premier League football (or a giant golf ball? You decide) while Liverpool fans will not tire of seeing the champions patches on the sleeve of their shirts. They do look a good fit I have to admit.</p>

<p>You have to go back 17 years for the last time this fixture was contested at Anfield in the top flight. Liverpool will be hoping for a repeat. In October 2003 goals from Michael Owen, Danny Murphy and Florent Sinama Pongolle (remember him?!) took the three points following Alan Smith's first half equaliser.</p>

<p>Also notable from that game, Harry Kewell's first game against Leeds after joining Liverpool and is that a young James Milner playing for the Elland Road outfit?</p>

<p>Meslier, Ayling, Koch, Struijk, Dallas, Phillips, Klich, Harrison, Hernandez, Costa, Bamford.</p>

<p>Alisson, Alexander-Arnold, Gomez, Van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Henderson, Keita, Mane, Salah, Firmino.</p>

<p>The Premier League is back!... Not that it ever seemed like it ever went away, but these are strange times.</p>

<p>Anyway on day one the champions are back in action and they host a Leeds United team back in the top flight after 16 years away. How it took so long for them to get back is anyone's guess, but love them or loathe them - the Premier League is greater for them being around.</p>

<p>Good evening all and welcome to our live coverage of Liverpool vs Leeds United where the confirmation of the teams will drop shortly.</p>
