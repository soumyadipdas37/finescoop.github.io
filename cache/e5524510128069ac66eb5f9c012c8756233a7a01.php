<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Officials are investigating how a flying wheel hit the car of British driver George Russell at Sunday’s Belgian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old Williams man was fortunate to escape uninjured after a rear wheel became detached from Antonio Giovinazzi’s Alfa Romeo and travelled into his path at 125mph.</p>

<p>It bounced off his own left-front tyre.</p>

<p>An investigation has been launched after George Russell's car was struck by flying rear wheel</p>

<p>Tethers are meant to prevent wheels coming off during accidents, such as when Giovinazzi lost control on the exit of Fagnes chicane.</p>

<p>FIA race director Michael Masi said: ‘It is a concern that it happened. I am not 100 per cent sure why it was detached but as soon as the car arrived back our technical team started their investigation.</p>

<p>‘We have all the available footage of the accident so the FIA technical department, along with the safety department, will review it. It is too early to draw conclusions.’</p>

<p>The FIA are hoping to reach a verdict before this weekend’s Italian Grand Prix at Monza, the ‘cathedral of speed’, where the average lap speeds are just under 160mph.</p>
