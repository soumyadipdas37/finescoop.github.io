<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham have confirmed the incredible return of Gareth Bale to north London after agreeing a loan deal with Real Madrid for the Wales superstar.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old flew into London on Friday afternoon on Daniel Levy's prvate jet, before agreeing a temporary move. Spurs will pay around £250,000 per-week, half of Bale's wages with Real Madrid footing the remainder of the bill. </p>

<p>Both chairman Levy and Jose Mourinho are thought to have been driving factors behind the deal, with the latter pleading for more creativity in his squad.</p>

<p>✍️ We are delighted to announce the return of <?php echo e('@'); ?>GarethBale11 to the Club on a season-long loan from Real Madrid!#BaleIsBack ⚪️ #COYS pic.twitter.com/6w8P1CLx61</p>

<p>Tottenham have confirmed the return of Gareth Bale who has joined on loan for 2020-21</p>

<p>The Welshman returns to north London seven years after departing for the Spanish giants</p>

<p>Spurs have agreed to pay £13m of his mammoth £26m-a-year wage, with Madrid paying rest</p>

<p>Levy had moved quickly after the 1-0 defeat by Everton on the opening weekend of the season to reach an agreement, with the majority of the deal being struck on Tuesday.</p>

<p>By Wednesday, Sportsmail had revealed that the player had agreed to come back to the club, with Friday's meeting in London merely to iron out a handful of contractual formalities.   </p>

<p>Daniel Levy and Mourinho are thought to be driving factors in securing Bale's return</p>

<p>The forward scored 54 goals and registered 46 assists during seven years at the club</p>

<p>Bale returns to Spurs - the club where he made his name - after a seven year stint in Madrid </p>

<p>Arrived: May 2007, from Southampton (£5million)</p>

<p>Games played: 195</p>

<p>Games started: 181</p>

<p>Goals: 54</p>

<p>Assists: 46</p>

<p>Awards: PFA, FWA Player of the Year, PFA Young Player of the Year</p>

<p>Departure: September 2013, to Real Madrid for £85million (then a world record fee)</p>

<p>It has subsequently been reported that the deal for Bale contains an option to extend his loan for a further 12 months to take the Welshman to the end of his contract with Real Madrid. </p>

<p>Bale had been left with little other option than to look for a club after falling out of favour at the Bernabeu following the return of head coach Zinedine Zidane. </p>

<p>After the confirmation of the deal, Spurs will look to place their new addition on an intensive fitness programme to ensure he is able to adapt to life back in the Premier League as swiftly as possible.  </p>

<p>Mourinho believes it could take him as long as four weeks to get back into top shape, meaning supporters may have to wait until October to see him in a Spurs shirt once again. </p>

<p>He has been struggling with a minor knee problem, as well as having not played much football over the past 12 months. He featured just twice and started just one game in the post-lockdown season as Real Madrid went on to seal the league title. </p>

<p>That could mean his second debut for Spurs could come following the international break, in October against London rivals West Ham on the 17th. </p>

<p>Tottenham are set to place Bale on an intensive training programme once he returns</p>

<p>Medics believe it will take Bale up to four weeks to be in top shape for Jose Mourinho's side</p>

<p>He spent the majority of last season on the bench, with figures suggesting he cost the Spanish champions £13,174 for every minute he played during the 2019-20 campaign.</p>

<p>Bale left White Hart Lane in 2013 for the Spanish capital in a world-record deal worth £90m. </p>

<p>He lifted the Champions League four times with the club, as well as winning two league titles. </p>

<p>Bale and Sergio Reguilon made the morning flight from Madrid together on a private jet</p>

<p>Bale was accompanied by Sergio Reguilon on Friday's flight, who will also join Spurs from Real Madrid.</p>

<p>The left-back enjoyed a stand-out season on loan at Sevilla last term, helping them to clinch the Europa League. </p>

<p>Mourinho is not finished yet in the transfer market, with the Portuguese still looking for a striker - although it is understood any deal for Southampton's Danny Ings is unlikely to get off the ground. </p>
