<p>For in the years since he was roundly mocked for saying he talked to plants – and that they ‘responded’ – evidence has grown that he may have been on to something.</p>

<p>And now it appears plants may be smarter than even the Prince of Wales thought.</p>

<p>According to researchers, plants can count, make decisions, recognise their relatives and even remember events. </p>

<p>And while they may not have a brain, they can learn in a similar way to humans and animals, say scientists.</p>

<p>Professor Umberto Castiello said: ‘Although the idea that plants may behave in a cognitive way may baffle the public, many of us are genuinely amazed by the complexity of plant responses.</p>

<p>‘Evidence is accumulating supporting notions that plants can communicate, remember, decide, and even count – all abilities that one would normally call cognitive if they were observed in animals.’</p>

<p>Professor Castiello said many studies show their cognitive abilities. One found Venus flytraps can ‘count’ the number of steps their prey made.</p>

<p>Scientists observed that the plant trapped prey only when an insect triggered it twice within 20 seconds. This means the plants can remember the first signal for a short time. The reason why plants need to ‘count’ the steps of its prey could be to avoid wasting energy by responding to random raindrops or windblown debris.</p>

<p>Another experiment showed the flowering plant Mimosa pudica can remember being dropped.</p>

<p>The plant was dropped from 6in 60 times in a row and by the end of the experiment it no longer folded its leaves in a defensive response as it realised being dropped from that height would not hurt.</p>

<p>‘The plant “realises” that being dropped is normal,’ Professor Castiello, from the University of Padua in Italy, wrote. ‘More astonishingly, this reflex lasts up to a month which demonstrates the acquisition and expression of a long-lasting memory.’</p>

<p>And shrubs can recognise their kin too as they release more chemicals when planted near their relatives which helps them stave off predators.</p>

<p>It is even thought plants can manipulate competitors when resources are scarce. Plants experiencing a lack of water can share this information with nearby shrubs by sending signals via their roots.</p>

<p>This prompts a nearby plant – its competitor – to start conserving water and this behaviour ultimately benefits both.</p>

<p>Professor Castiello concluded: ‘The question should no longer be if plants are cognitive organisms but how plants make use of their cognitive capacities.’</p>
