<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She has been accused of having butt implants in the past, a rumour she has long since denied.  </p>

<p>And fitness entrepreneur Tammy Hembrow showed just how much work it takes to (naturally) achieve her famous rounded backside on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The fitness entrepreneur, from Queensland's Gold Coast, uploaded three signature 'booty burners' to Instagram to encourage her followers on their fitness journey. </p>

<p>No fake booty here! Tammy Hembrow has shared the simple workout to get her famous backside after being accused of having butt implants </p>

<p>The blonde bombshell could be seen squatting with a secret weapon to make the most of her workout - the booty band. </p>

<p>The grey strap was wrapped around the outer middle-part of Tammy's thighs while she did squats and lunges.</p>

<p>The resistance band works by providing external resistance - making it harder for muscles to work against and complete the movement.</p>

<p>While the mother-of-two does not appear to struggle in the videos, her facial expressions tell the audience otherwise.</p>

<p>She was seen gripping her hands together while scrunching up her face as she moved through each rep.</p>

<p>'Make sure you save these booty burners for later,' she encouraged her followers on the Tammy Hembrow Fitness account. </p>

<p>'If you haven't already for the TF booty bands, get in quickkkk.'  </p>

<p>She then went on to demonstrate how to use the bands for side-to-side squats.</p>

<p>Tammy was seen holding two large dumbbells in the second video while sporting barely-there black shorts and an almost see-through sports bra with 'Honey' on the front. </p>

<p>She methodically breathed through each rep while looking away from the camera, before moving onto laying hip thrust in the third video.</p>

<p>This simple exercise, which anybody can do from the comfort of their own home, is good for improving strength, stabilising the core and growing glutes.  </p>

<p>Tammy has long been determined to shut down critics who have accused her of getting implants and injections to achieve her bottom.</p>

<p>'Das a 100% natural booty,' she wrote on Instagram in October last year, in response to a fan who had asked if she'd had a Brazilian butt lift.</p>

<p>Brazilian butt lifts involve removing fat from other areas of the body with liposuction, and then injecting it into the bottom.</p>

<p>In an interview with Cosmopolitan in August 2018, Tammy revealed she had always been on the skinny side.</p>

<p>But she said she discovered she could mold her body into the shape she wanted simply by building muscle.</p>

<p>'I think people see my photos and think it may have happened overnight,' she told the publication of transforming her body.</p>

<p>'It was not a quick process.'</p>

<p>Tammy revealed she hits the gym four times a week for gruelling workouts, and spends three of those sessions focusing on her lower body.</p>

<p>She said diet also plays a massive part in building up mass around her bottom.</p>

<p>'It's more frustrating than anything because I don't want people to think they can't achieve a booty with hard work,' she told Cosmopolitan of accusations her bottom is fake.</p>

<p>'It just creates a false mindset that it's not achievable and surgery is the only option, which is completely wrong.'</p>

<p>All natural: Tammy has long been determined to shut down critics who have accused her of getting implants and injections to achieve her bottom </p>
