<p>When four becomes five! Grant Denyer and his wife Chezzi (pictured with their two daughters Scout, four, and Sailor, eight) recently announced that they are expecting their third child in March 2021</p>

<p>She wrote: 'I am 40 years old and having a baby... I live in country NSW and get comments like... "Why would you at your age?" "Was it an accident?" "Are you worried something will be wrong with the baby?"' </p>

<p>Former TV producer Chezzi, who shares daughters Scout, four, and Sailor, eight, with her husband, explained that despite the negativity in her local area, she has received plenty of positive messages from friends living in other parts of Australia.</p>

<p>Unkind: Chezzi Denyer has been left outraged after receiving rude comments from strangers about her decision to have a child at 40 </p>

<p>'But on the flip side, many of my friends 40+ living in Sydney or Melbourne are only now trying to have their first child,' she explained.</p>

<p>She then added that she feels more 'calm and confident' this time round and she credits that to her age. </p>

<p>'There's something you don't have when you're really young and that is wisdom.. and my ripe old age of 40 I feel I have plenty,' she concluded.  </p>
