<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Hong Kong-based makeup brand has received backlash online after naming a liquid blusher after 15-year-old Holocaust victim Anne Frank.    </p>

<p>Woke Up Like This (WULT) - who have since issued an apology and recalled the product - labelled a blusher 'Dream Like Anne' as part of a new collection to celebrate female empowerment.   </p>

<p>And it wasn't long before people took to social media and slammed the inappropriate branding.  </p>

<p>'Naming a shade of blush after Anne Frank, who was a victim of genocide is revolting. Dead Jews are not a marketing opportunity,' wrote one.</p>

<p>A Hong Kong-based makeup brand has received backlash online after naming a liquid blusher after 15-year-old Holocaust victim Anne Frank (pictured) </p>

<p>The blusher (pictured) was released as part of a new collection to celebrate female empowerment</p>

<p>A second agreed: 'WTAF!? I am just STAGGERED that at no point in the creative process did anyone on the Woke Up Like This team, or ANY of the other hundreds of people involved say “ummm guys, this might not be appropriate.' </p>

<p>Anne kept a diary during her time in hiding that was published after the war and turned her into a globally recognised symbol of Holocaust victims.</p>

<p>The blusher was released during Sexual Health Awareness month and retailed at around £29.85 ($38.50). </p>

<p>The product description read: 'The baby between baby purple and baby pink, this pastel tint is a dreamer with cheeks kissed by the soft petals of a dusty rose. </p>

<p>'The uniquely eye-catching colour blends into skin with beauty and grace.' </p>

<p>Many were quick to take to Twitter, with one writing: 'Naming a shade of blush after Anne Frank, who was a victim of genocide is revolting. Dead Jews are not a marketing opportunity' (pictured)</p>

<p>Famous names used for the four other pastel-tone shades include Woolf’s Words after writer Virginia Woolf, Lift Like Melinda after philanthropist Melinda Gates, and Viva La Frida after Mexican painter Frida Kahlo.</p>

<p>According to Metro, WULT said: ‘The miracle of her legacy, ‘The Diary of a Young Girl’, is that even in the face of extreme hardship, isolation, and ultimate tragedy, her seminal expression of hope for the future continues to inspire generations. </p>

<p>They continued: ‘We are extremely sorry that paying tribute to her in this way appears to have caused offense and is considered disrespectful. ‘Our intention was quite the reverse, to bring positive energy and shite a little light through unprecedented testing times during the global pandemic. </p>

<p>‘We sincerely apologise for any miscommunication; and “Dream Like Anne” is therefore officially withdrawn from our online store with immediate effect.’ </p>

<p>FEMAIL has contacted WULT for comment.  </p>
