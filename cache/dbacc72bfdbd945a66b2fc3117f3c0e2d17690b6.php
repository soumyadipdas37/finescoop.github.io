<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An 18-year-old man has been charged with the murder of a couple who were shot during a phony car sale that was arranged online, police say.</p>

<p>Joseph Roland, 39, and his wife Jossline Roland, 40, were shot outside an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, while trying to buy an SUV.</p>

<p>The couple were not aware the car was stolen when arranging to meet the seller at around 11pm on August 14, an arrest affidavit filed in Arapahoe County District Court said.</p>

<p>Kyree Brown has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after allegedly admitting to shooting the parents, who have five children, the Denver Post reported.</p>

<p>Joseph and Jossline Roland, 39 and 40, (both pictured) were shot outside an apartment complex in Aurora, Colorado, on August 14 at a phony car sale that was arranged online</p>

<p>Mr Roland, who was operations manager at ABM Industries, agreed to buy a Toyota Rav4 through letgo, an online website for buying used goods.</p>

<p>He had arranged to meet the seller in Southlands Mall car park with his wife, who was a firm administrator at Dianne Sawaya law offices.</p>

<p>But after arriving, Brown told the couple he brought the wrong car title and asked them to follow him to an apartment on East Cornell Circle.</p>

<p>Brown allegedly pointed a 9mm handgun at Mr Roland while the couple were still in their car and demanded the money. </p>

<p>The car started moving and Brown intentionally shot Mr Roland before accidentally shooting Mrs Roland, the arrest affidavit claims.</p>

<p>Brown allegedly grabbed $3,000 from the car and fled from the scene before trying to burn the car by pouring gasoline on the seats.</p>

<p>Aurora Police said that Brown posted the car advert on letgo under a fake name, but used an email account that detectives were able to link him with. </p>

<p>Police added that his mobile number was found through the online goods website. </p>

<p>Kyree Brown, 18, (above) has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after allegedly admitting to the shooting. He was detained on August 27 after a police chase</p>

<p>The phone had pinged towers near the mall, apartment complex and location where the car was burned, near Havana Street and East Colfax Avenue, police said.</p>

<p>The couple died within five minutes of each other after being rushed to hospital, CBS Denver reported.</p>

<p>Brown was detained on August 27 after a short police chase, which ended near 29th Avenue and Central Park Boulevard in Denver.</p>

<p>A fundraiser has been set up by Brittany Southerland to raise funds for the couple's five children.</p>

<p>It reads: 'Anyone who knew Joe and Jossline would remember they were always the first to help. They were the best people you could know and their door was always open to friends and family.</p>

<p>'We would like to raise money for their children. No amount of money can replace what they’ve lost, but maybe we can pull together and provide some financial security for them.'</p>
