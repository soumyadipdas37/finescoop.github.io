<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new season is officially here and while it's always sad to say goodbye to the summer, we're ready for some autumnal action.</p>

<p>And as we all know, the fashion gets really good at this time of year.</p>

<p>So, if you're ready for a wardrobe update we're here to help.</p>

<p>There are plenty of trends to get stuck into but we've picked out 5 of our favourites to get you going. </p>

<p>Let us know which you'll be rocking this season in the comments below... </p>

<p> 1. For the love of lilac</p>

<p>For the love of lilac at BOSS, Alberta Ferretti and Jacquemus AW20</p>

<p>Pastel shades are always a lovely and feminine choice.</p>

<p>But for AW20 it's all about lilac.</p>

<p>This washed out hue is ultra pretty but somehow retains a touch of cool where a pale pink can often look too girly for some.  </p>

<p>We love this fringed dress as seen at BOSS AW20 and we're crushing HARD on the styling at both Alberta Ferretti and Jacquemus AW20.</p>

<p>Pairing lilac trousers with darker, and even lighter, shades of purple is such a gorgeous way to wear it.</p>

<p>Plus, Prince would be proud.</p>

<p> 2. Bold checks</p>

<p>Bold checks at Brock Collection, Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen AW20</p>

<p>Checks, tartan and plaid are never very far away, but for AW20 they're bigger, bolder and brighter than ever before. </p>

<p>At Brock Collection they strutted down the runway in mustard yellow and purple, while at Christian Dior they were Clueless-adjacent in this cute little tartan mini kilt.</p>

<p>And at Alexander McQueen the checks were rotated to fall on the diagonal and were seriously outsized too.</p>

<p>So add some checks into your style as separates, as outerwear or as an eye-catching full look this season.</p>

<li>Ravishing in red</li>
</ol>

<p>Ravishing in red at Altuzarra, Alexander McQueen and Balmain AW20</p>

<p>Anyone looking for a statement shade to rock this season can relax.</p>

<p>Autumn's foremost primary colour is ravishing red. Or sexy scarlet, depending on how you look at things.</p>

<p>If you're a little shy then just add one piece of red to your look with a blouse or skirt, but if you want to turn heads then follow the lead of designers like Altuzarra, Alexander McQueen and Balmain.</p>

<p>Their models sashayed down the catwalk in top-to-toe looks and there's no denying the drama they created. So why not do the same?</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>The new bodycon</li>
</ol>

<p>The new bodycon at Altuzarra, Balmain and Brandon Maxwell AW20 </p>

<p>If someone says bodycon to you, what images spring to mind?</p>

<p>Maybe a Kardashian or an early TOWIE cast member in a bandage dress and skyscraper heels?</p>

<p>Well, forget that particular brand of bodycon and embrace a fresh new take.</p>

<p>Bodycon is short for 'body conscious' which doesn't have to mean skin tight. It also doesn't need to mean short.</p>

<p>For AW20 bodycon is ever so slightly more relaxed. It's knitted, ribbed and more demure. Think Altuzarra's fitted skirt, Balmain's form-fitting knit and Brandon Maxwell's high neck and long sleeves. </p>

<p>This is bodycon that's elegant and understated, but definitely still sexy.</p>

<p> 5. Luxe in leather</p>

<p>Luxe in leather at Brandon Maxwell, Balenciaga and Isabel Marant AW20</p>

<p>Leather never really goes out of style but it's a big part of AW20 so if you've never worn it before then now is the time.</p>

<p>Leather is one of those materials that adds a feeling of luxury in an instant. However you wear it, you'll immediately look a bit more 'expensive'. </p>

<p>Start with leather trousers. Skinny styles were seen at Brandon Maxwell or do the paper bag waist look like at Isabel Marant. </p>

<p>Then why not add a leather skirt, dress or coat to your capsule wardrobe? </p>

<p>And it goes without saying you don't need to buy the real deal to achieve the luxe look. </p>

<p>Faux leather is not only much more affordable, but is the vegan option too!</p>

<p>The new bodycon</p>

<p>L-R: Kenzo Pleated Dress (£325) and V by Very Jada Cross Waist Bodycon Pencil Dress (£50) at Very</p>

<p>Kenzo's pleated knit midi dress nails the new bodycon trend and will look fly with sneakers or chunky ankle boots, while this pencil dress by V by Very, ramps up the raciness a notch or two.</p>

<p> Luxe in leather</p>
