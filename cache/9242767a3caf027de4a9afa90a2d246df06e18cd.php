<p>At least 1,200 motorists, who paid for their parking but made the error, were slapped with $83 fines in Melbourne.</p>

<p>Melbourne City Council has since agreed to pay back thousands of dollars after an investigation by the Victorian Ombudsman.</p>

<p>More than 1,000 drivers were given tickets after accidentally inputting the wrong licence plate details for their parking space in Melbourne (pictured a parking sign in Melbourne)</p>

<p>Ombudsman Deborah Glass said the approach of parking officers was 'overly rigid' in their handling of the fines. </p>

<p>'The council knew the number 0 and letter O were virtually indistinguishable on registration plates, and drivers would not be aware they had made such an error,' she said in her findings which were tabled to parliament on Wednesday. </p>

<p>'The lack of discretion – to allow common sense judgements – was both unfair and wrong.'</p>

<p>The motorists confused the number 0 with the letter O when filling out their car registration for parking through the PayStay App in the city of Melbourne</p>

<p>She found a total of 1,200 drivers were wrongfully issued $83 fines each over the typing error.</p>

<p>An investigation was launched after a complaint by a concerned local who argued  the council was trying to boost its revenue through parking fines.</p>

<p>But Ms Glass found the council had actually lost more money through fighting the fines in court than it had earned issuing them.</p>

<p>Ombudsdam Deborah Glass said Melbourne City of Council parking officials were 'overly rigid' in their handling of the parking fines (pictured: street parking returned to full capacity in May in Melbourne during the COVID-19 pandemic)</p>

<p>Her investigation did expose 'an entrenched and overzealous attitude' among some officials in regards to enforcing the fines.</p>

<p>'A mindset that the customer is usually wrong and drivers must be punished for their infractions, no matter how small the offence or how great the mitigation,' she said. </p>

<p>The council changed its protocol in October 2019 so anyone issued an unfair fine will have the infringement reversed on appeal.</p>
