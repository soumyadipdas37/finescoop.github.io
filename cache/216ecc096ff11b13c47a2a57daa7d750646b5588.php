<p>Speaking on today's show, she admitted she did 'everything she could' to hide her financial difficulties from her family</p>

<p>'I did hide everything financial from my kids', said Brenda'  'And my family in general, I didn't want them to know I was struggling.</p>

<p>'It was very hard I was a single mum with two kids and I wanted to work and I found I was working to live. I was paid £500 a month, £350 of that was going on a child minder and so you've got £150 for food and school clothes for your utilities, for rent. </p>

<p>'There was a time I just ran out of money, I had an electricity meter and it goes into emergency credit , I didn't have any money and I was just sitting there crying in the dark because I had no money.</p>

<p>[I was] thinking how am I going to get out of this?  What am I going to do? You want to do your bit for society, but I didn't feel I had the help and support back I had to be raising my children.' </p>

<p>She told fellow host Carol McGiffin (left) her children would eat the same meal three times a week, and that she was mocked by a colleague for asking whether she could take home the office's old sofa</p>

<p>Host Andrea McLean asked: 'Did you ever struggle to feed your children?' </p>

<p>She replied: 'Absolutely. They would eat the same thing twice or three times in that week. I would do corned beef and rice and tuna and pasta and Sunday we would go and have the big dinner. </p>

<p>'For me it was things basic like sitting on a chair, I didn’t have sofas in my house and it was only when I started working as an accounts payable manager and they were chucking out some sofas. </p>

<p>'I said: "Can I have this so my kids have somewhere to sit" And they laughed at me. I said "Why are you laughing at me? I can't even afford second hand" </p>

<p>'We used that sofa for two or three years and I didn’t tell the children, I didn’t want them to have that stress and I think I’ve done a good job and I'm a stronger woman for everything I’ve gone through.' </p>
