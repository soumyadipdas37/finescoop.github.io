<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The brother of a woman stabbed to death by her ex-partner in southwest Sydney will never forget his mother crying after losing her 'baby'.</p>

<p>Pepe Nahu-Roberts says the day he found out of his younger sister's death will be 'etched in my memory for the rest of my life'.</p>

<p>'I will never forget the crying of a mother for her baby, not something I ever want to hear again in my life... you don't only hear it you feel it,' he told the Supreme Court via video link during his victim impact statement.</p>

<p>James Fredes, 60, has pleaded guilty to murdering 43-year-old mother Erana Nahu after she was stabbed in bed in her Glenfield home in 2018</p>

<p>James Fredes, 60, has pleaded guilty to murdering 43-year-old mother Erana Nahu after she was stabbed in bed in her Glenfield home in 2018.</p>

<p>At his sentence hearing on Monday, Mr Nahu-Roberts said Fredes' crime was calculated because he waited for Ms Nahu's cousin - who was living with her at the time - to fall asleep before he murdered her.</p>

<p>'The life of my sister not taken by a crazy or abused person... the person knew what they were doing, whatever the motivation was.'</p>

<p>Defence lawyer Fiona Jowett says Fredes acknowledges the seriousness of his crime and the 'horrendous reality' of his actions, and that he expressed genuine remorse after the event.</p>

<p>'He stayed by her side sobbing throughout the ordeal and was visibly distressed when he was told she had passed by the injuries he had inflicted,' Ms Jowett told the court.</p>

<p>Fredes apologised to Ms Nahu's cousin and the police and asked paramedics who attended the scene whether they would be able to save her, she said.</p>

<p>'He never meant to kill her - just harm her.'</p>

<p>Ms Nahu had previously told Fredes that she had moved on with another relationship</p>

<p>Ms Nahu had previously told Fredes that she had moved on with another relationship, but had invited him to stay with her not long before the murder, crown prosecutor Sean Hughes told the court.</p>

<p>Fredes perceived there was still hope of rekindling their relationship, and became acutely jealous and angry when she rejected his advances one evening in October.</p>

<p>Ms Jowett says there was less than a minute between him leaving the bedroom, walking down the hall and returning with the knife he used to stab Ms Nahu in an attempt to cause her some harm.</p>

<p>'There was momentary planning but it was for less than a minute when he actually stood there and decided to do what he did with the knife.'</p>

<p>Forensic psychologist doctor Marcelo Rodriguez has subsequently diagnosed Fredes with borderline personality disorder which affects his ability to rationalise and use proper judgement.</p>

<p>Dr Rodriguez submitted in his report that when Fredes attacked Ms Nahu he could have been experiencing acute psycho-social distress as a result of his mental condition.</p>

<p>Acting Justice Peter Hidden is due to hand down his sentence on October 1.</p>
