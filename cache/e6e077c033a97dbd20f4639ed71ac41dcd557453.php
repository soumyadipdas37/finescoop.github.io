<p>'I'm a bit neurotic': Robbie Williams has revealed he's living in Switzerland in a bid to avoid contracting coronavirus (pictured in the country with wife Ayda Field last month)</p>

<p>When asked he's living in his Los Angeles or Malibu home, the media personality said: 'No I’m not. I’m somewhere in Switzerland up a mountain. </p>

<p>'Well, I’m a bit neurotic and I thought where can I place myself where it won’t get me? And I thought, well I’ll just live up the Mont Blanc for 6 months… it’s really warm actually, it’s really lovely.'</p>

<p>On how the global outbreak has affected his lifestyle, the former Take That star admitted while he loves spending time with his children, he's eager to get back to 'doing what I love'.</p>

<p>'I thought, well I’ll just live up the Mont Blanc for 6 months': The former X Factor judge has been enjoying some quality time with his family during lockdown (pictured in July)</p>

<p>The belter said: 'The performing arts is suffering greatly because of it and, on a personal note from me, I’m so grateful to do what I do for a living and can’t wait to get back to work and start performing again. </p>

<p>'I’m loving my time with my family, I’m loving my time with my wife, I’ve got 4 kids – it’s joyous – but I’m chomping at the bit now to leave the house and do what I do for a living and what I love.'</p>

<p>The former X Factor judge also confessed his thoughts on having a family changed once he and the model, 41, welcomed their first child.</p>

<p>Robbie said: 'I thought, like, that some strangers turn up and ruin the party, that’s what having kids was like. </p>

<p>Romantic: Despite his worries about the pandemic, the media personality enjoyed a trip to Italy last week</p>

<p>'I couldn’t imagine that the universe just presents itself to you and goes "No, here’s a life changing gift that you will love and adore for all of time" so, yeah, so we had 4 of them.'  </p>

<p>On whether his mini-mes will be following in his footsteps, he added: 'Teddy came out of the womb with jazz hands which was incredibly painful for my wife but I would like Charlie to manage me and Teddy to come and join.</p>

<p>'I said to Teddy the other day, ''Baby, when you’re older do you want to come singing with daddy?'' and she went ''No daddy, you’ll be singing with me!''' </p>

<p>Robbie and Ayda, who exchanged rings during their lavish wedding ceremony in 2010, have had to put their plans for a vow renewal ceremony to celebrate the milestone on hold because of the pandemic. </p>
