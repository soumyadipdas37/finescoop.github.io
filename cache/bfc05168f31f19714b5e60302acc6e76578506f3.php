<p>The two swimmers were relaxing in the ocean off the coast of Lorne on the Great Ocean Road, 138km south-west of Melbourne.  </p>

<p>Since Melbourne has been in a hard lockdown since August 2, residents in regional Victoria, including Lorne, have been allowed to go outside to exercise without the strict one-hour time limit.</p>

<p>They are also allowed to undergo outdoor recreation but can only gather with one person from outside their household in public. </p>

<p>But that is all due to change at 11.59pm Wednesday when regional parts of the state progress to the third step in Premier Daniel Andrews' lockdown reopening roadmap. </p>

<p>Footage of the encounter was posted on Facebook with the caption: 'this dolphin came out to play with the swimmers this morning...'.</p>

<p>The dolphin continued to be cheeky and swim between them while doing flips in the water.</p>

<p>One of the swimmers was even seen diving under the water the interact with the playful creatures. </p>

<p>'This is amazing this dolphin has been hanging around allot wanting to make friends with all that comes near. Soooo beautiful,' another said.</p>
