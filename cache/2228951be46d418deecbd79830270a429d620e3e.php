<p>Killing time: The former AFL star is normally a brunette, but he admitted he 'got bored' on Saturday and decided to change up his hair colour and go blond</p>

<p>The former Carlton footy star then joked 'just a candid shot of my grouse look', alongside the hashtags 'new hair' and 'blonds have more fun'. </p>

<p>Brendan claimed he was channeling Eminem's Slim Shady look with his newly bleached hair and said: 'ISO got me doing weird s**t'. </p>

<p>Work in progress! On Saturday, Brendan revealed he was channelling Eminem's Slim Shady look as he shared a photo of his newly bleached hair and said: 'ISO got me doing weird s**t' </p>

<p>The media personality shared an Instagram photo showing a list of a chores and a bunch of snacks.</p>

<p>The payment for these tasks was generous - $20 for cleaning their room, $50 for exercise and $20 for thirty minutes of reading. </p>

<p>In exchange for the payment, the girls could buy chocolates, chips and others snacks from the nearby shelf. </p>

<p>Wow! The 39-year-old shared an Instagram photo, showing a list of chores and a bunch of snacks. Chores could be exchanged for Monopoly money, which can then be used to buy treats from the special shelf </p>

<p>But the prices were steep - $50 for popcorn, $25 for a snack sized bag of chips and a whopping $100 for ice cream.  </p>

<p>The twist: the payments were not made in cash but Monopoly money, making the whole task a fun game. </p>

<p>Brendan captioned the photo:  'Best parent advice I've seen so far. Trying this with my kids see how we all go have a crack'.</p>

<p>Nice! Last month the former AFL star revealed a novel way to keep his daughters Leni, Lulu and baby Tobi (all pictured) busy and well behaved while homeschooling them</p>
