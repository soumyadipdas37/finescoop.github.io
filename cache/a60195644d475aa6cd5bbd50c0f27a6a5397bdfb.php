<p>On the town: Cindy Crawford, 54, looked chic in a tan safari jacket as she arrived at the swanky Japanese restaurant Nobu Malibu on Wednesday for a night out with her girlfriends</p>

<p>The tan item featured double breast and waist pocket, and she had it cinched tightly around her waist. </p>

<p>Cindy added a splash of color to her muted outfit with a burnt orange satin skirt covered in festive palm tree designs. </p>

<p>She elevated her 5ft9in stature with a set of brown mule heels and wore a white mask to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, though some of her friends eschewed masks in the parking lot.</p>

<p>She accessorized with a brown suede bag slung over one shoulder while she carried a slim black case in her other hand.</p>

<p>Earth tones: Cindy paired her jacket with a burnt orange satin skirt adorned with palm trees, as well as a pair of brown mule heels</p>

<p>Cindy appeared to be having a girls' night out without her husband Rande Gerber, 58.</p>

<p>The two married in 1998, making it the second marriage for Cindy, who was previously married to Richard Gere, and they celebrated their 22nd wedding anniversary in May. </p>

<p>The two know a thing or two about the restaurant business themselves, as Rande owns the Cuban restaurant Cafe Habana nearby in Malibu.</p>

<p>As the ongoing coronavirus pandemic has decimated restaurant profits, their son Presley Gerber has been putting in shifts at the restaurant on and off.</p>

<p>Mixed success: The supermodel wore a white mask to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, though some of her friends didn't put them on in the parking lot</p>

<p>On her own: Her husband Rande Gerber, 58, seemed to have sat out the dinner, as did her son Presley, 21, and her daughter Kaia Gerber, 19; shown in 2017</p>

<p>Cindy's outing came a week after she and Rande sold their mid-century modern Beverly Hills home for an impressive $16 million.</p>

<p>The couple stand to profit off the house, which they purchased three years ago for $11.625 million from New Republic frontman Ryan Tedder.</p>

<p>Cindy and Rande, who was formerly a model, shared Presley, 21, and Kaia Gerber, 19, both of whom followed their parents into modeling.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter recently shared the honor of gracing alternate covers for Vogue Italia's September issue.</p>
