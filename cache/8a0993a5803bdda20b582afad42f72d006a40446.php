<p>The performer also shared many details of her wedding: the ceremony took place at their $2M home in Ventura County, California, on August 29 in front of 24 guest. Their mini honeymoon was in Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>The wedding came as a surprise because she had just divorced her husband Nash, Jay Tucker in March.  </p>

<p>'I don’t feel like my marriage is my coming out of anywhere, but rather a going into myself and being honest about who I love. And I’m not limiting myself on what that love is supposed to look like.' </p>

<p>The beauty also wants her fans to know that she was not hiding holding anything back. 'I was not suppressing my sexuality my whole life,' said the TV star. 'I love who I love. At one point in my life, I married twice and I love those people. And today I love this person. </p>

<p>'I've done everything I wanted to do on my own terms and my own way. So my choice now in a partner has nothing to do with who I've always been. It's a matter of who I am in this moment.'</p>

<p>Nash also shared she became close friends with Jessica in 2015.</p>

<p>But at the time she was happy with her husband Jay and she did not see the singer as someone she would date. </p>

<p>But then in October 2019, Niecy told the site, something changed. </p>

<p>'I loved her before I was in love with her because she is such a special human being,' said Nash.</p>

<p>'But we began to see each other in a way we never had before. Sometimes you get so broken by love, you run from it. But I’ve learned that you should always hold space for magic because it can happen at any time.'  </p>

<p>Nash and Betts broke the news of their wedding last week on Instagram. 'I love my wife,' said the TV wonder in one caption.</p>

<p>'Wishing you both happiness': Filmmaker Ava DuVernay shared an image from the ceremony on social media and said it had been 'an honor' to witness their wedding</p>

<p>In October, DailyMail.com exclusively reported that the couple's troubles began amid strain over living in different cities, Nash's graphic sex scenes on television and her sexy new look.</p>

<p>In her property settlement, the actress 'gets their house in Bell Canyon, CA and the 2016 Tesla. She also gets to keep her production company, Chocolate Chick,' TMZ reported.</p>

<p>Additionally, the outlet said that Jay, who is an electrical engineer, will keep his 2011 Ford F-150 truck and a $184,820 payout from his ex-wife.</p>

<p>The money is Tucker's cut from the sale of a property they once shared, and aside from that, both parties agreed not to request spousal support. </p>

<p>Interestingly, prior to news of their split being made public, Nash had quietly listed the Bell Canyon home for $1.2 million in July of 2019.</p>

<p>According to sources who spoke with DailyMail.com, the couple had been having issues for nearly two years prior to finally calling it quits. </p>

<p>Betts was there for the last wedding: The two go back in time. Jessica sang at Niecy's wedding to Jay in 2011 in Malibu</p>

<p>Niecy and Jay were married in Malibu in 2011 but their relationship took a turn in part due to the star's full-body cosmetic surgery makeover and her 'extreme career ambitions.'</p>

<p>A source close to the former couple told DailyMail.com at the time: 'Niecy got a brand new body right before she went to film Claws down in New Orleans and that's when their troubles began. Jay was really uncomfortable with her graphic sex scenes on the show and that made their problems worse.</p>

<p>'They were living in two different cities and Jay expressed he didn't like his wife being in New Orleans while he was in LA.'</p>

<p>“You got Divorced? Betts, say less” 😂👽💍</p>

<p>A post shared by  Jessica Betts (<?php echo e('@'); ?>jessicabettsmusic) on Sep 4, 2020 at 4:36pm PDT</p>

<p>When the comedy-drama had its big premiere in LA in June of 2017, Tucker didn't attend because the couple had been fighting about the show, according to the source.</p>

<p>And while Tucker did attend Nash's ceremony for her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in the summer of 2018, he wasn't by her side in September when she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie for her role in When They See Us.</p>

<p>Niecy was also previously married to Don Nash from 1994 to 2007. </p>
