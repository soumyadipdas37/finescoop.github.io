<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The record for the most number of goals in a single Premier League gameweek could be broken on Monday night, with just five goals needed to eclipse the all-time total in the modern era.</p>

<p>A whopping 39 goals were scored during Saturday and Sunday's action, which is just four behind the record for the most in a top-flight gameweek in a 20-team season - set in February, 2011.</p>

<p>Aston Villa host Sheffield United while Manchester City travel to Wolverhampton Wanderers in Monday night's Premier League action to round off the epic weekend.</p>

<p>Five goals are needed on Monday to break the top-flight record for most goals in a gameweek</p>

<p>39 goals have gone in so far this weekend, including seven in the Southampton vs Spurs game</p>

<p>Gameweek two of the 2020-21 Premier League season started in superb fashion as Everton thumped West Bromwich Albion 5-2, before Leeds triumphed 4-3 over Fulham. </p>

<p>Saturday's action also saw Crystal Palace stun Manchester United 3-1 at Old Trafford, before Arsenal edged West Ham 2-1 in north London.</p>

<p>In total, Saturday's action saw 21 goals go in, which is record for a single day of Premier League football with a maximum of four games played.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Tottenham continued the spree with a 5-2 thrashing of Southampton at St Mary's, with four goals coming from South Korean forward Son Heung-Min.</p>

<p>Everton began the weekend in stunning fashion as they beat West Brom 5-2 on Saturday</p>

<p>Brighton picked up their first win of the season later in the day with a comfortable 3-0 victory at Newcastle, while Premier League champions Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-0 at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>The weekend's top-flight goalscoring tally could have been even greater had Chelsea's Jorginho netted a late penalty, but Alisson saved his spot kick in west London.</p>

<p>The fourth match of Sunday saw a six-goal thriller as Leicester City beat Burnley 4-2 at the King Power Stadium. </p>

<p>Leeds' 4-3 win over Fulham helped Saturday's action reach 21 goals - a record for a single day</p>

<p>There was a six-goal thriller on Sunday as Leicester beat Burnley 4-2 at the King Power</p>

<p>The all-time record for most goals in a 20-team season weekend has stood for nearly a decade since Premier League clubs went crazy in early February, 2011.</p>

<p>The most eye-catching result was Newcastle's 4-4 draw with Arsenal at St James' Park, made even more special by the fact that the Magpies were 4-0 down to Arsene Wenger's side at half-time.</p>

<p>Everton also beat Blackpool 5-3 at Goodison Park, while Wigan edged Blackburn Rovers 4-3 in a thriller in Greater Manchester. </p>

<p>That weekend is second-highest in the list of all-time Premier League weekend results as 53 goals were scored on the final day of the 1992-93 season. </p>

<p>The record was set in February 2011, the same weekend as Newcastle's 4-4 draw with Arsenal </p>

<p>However, 22 teams competed in a 42-game season back then with the top-flight reduced to just 20 sides in 1995. </p>

<p>This weekend is on course to break the record for the most average goals-per-game across a single gameweek in Premier League history with a minimum of five games played.</p>

<p>So far, 4.88 goals have been averaged across the weekend's action, which is more than the 4.82 from May 1993.</p>

<p>Saturday: </p>

<p>Everton 5-2 West Bromwich Albion</p>

<p>Leeds 4-3 Fulham </p>

<p>Manchester United 1-3 Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Arsenal 2-1 West Ham</p>
