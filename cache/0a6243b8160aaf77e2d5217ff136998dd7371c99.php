<p>Prosecutor Linda Strudwick told jurors Holmes had booked a one and a half hour spa massage at the central London hotel.</p>

<p>She said: 'Towards the end of the massage, Lord Holmes grabbed [the complainant's] arm. He sat up on the table where the massage was taking place.</p>

<p>'He asked how old she was. Then he asked her "can I see how you look?"</p>

<p>'[She] was unsure about what he meant but assumed that it meant could he touch her face.</p>

<p>'She allowed him to do this, but then feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable at that point she began to move away.</p>

<p>'Mr Holmes stopped her by grabbing her buttocks.</p>

<p>'He said nice and he asked if he could touch her boobs. She said 'no'.</p>

<p>'He asked if she 'did extras' and pointed towards his crotch, she said 'No, I am a professional'.</p>

<p>'He said: "Are you sure you've never done it?"</p>

<p>'Mr Holmes obviously realised that he had gone too far, he made shushing noises to her and apologised,' said Ms Strudwick.</p>

<p>Holmes then 'calmed down' the shocked woman, who finished the massage and wordlessly handed him over a robe, the court heard.</p>

<p>The distressed woman went straight to her manager and also told her work agency and boyfriend, jurors heard.</p>

<p>Holmes, of Richmond, Surrey, denies one count of sexual assault.</p>

<p>The trial continues.</p>
