<p>But recent applications for cafe work, mowing lawns and trade work as a boiler maker and welder came up short.</p>

<p>'I think these people are very old-fashioned and think I'm a troublesome teenager,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily.</p>

<p>He said it has nothing to do with his work ethic, but rather a stereotype of being a 'punk'.</p>

<p>'I dress the way I dress to express myself. I don't want to fit with the system because it's broken,' he said. </p>

<p>'I'm being myself, and if people are choosing to discriminate against me and tell me to pull my piercings out, then they can.' </p>

<p>Novak Daniels, 18, has been rejected for countless jobs and apprenticeships across the Sunshine Cost because of his appearance</p>

<p>One of his latest TikTok videos gathered 1.8million views - and he has more than 55,000 subscribers on the video sharing platform.  </p>

<p>He is also hoping to launch his own business where he plans to sell affordable punk clothing kits. </p>
