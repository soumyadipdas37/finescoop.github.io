<p>Balance: Arg kneeled on his paddle board as he manoeuvred himself on the water during the session</p>

<p>Exercise: Arg showed off his impressive tan after having spent most of his summer in Marbella and Portugal</p>

<p>He looked casual in a navy blue t-shirt, shorts and black Nike trainers as he worked up a sweat and took in the scenic views on the walk. </p>

<p>Arg revealed he transformed his eating habits and lost two stone when he went on Jason Vale's retreat in Portugal in August after randomly bumping into the health and fitness guru, 51.  </p>

<p>The TV star told The Sun on Sunday: 'I met Jason on the off chance and he called my bluff when I said I'd book in. So the next day I bought my flights and flew to his resort in Portugal. All I drank for a fortnight was juices. </p>

<p>Hard work: The paddle board session proved to be a challenge as he used his muscles to push through the water</p>

<p>Whoops: However at one point the star lost his balance and fell head first into the refreshing waters</p>

<p>Taking a dip: Arg pulled himself out of the water via some stairs after his session came to an end </p>

<p>Making a splash: Arg showed off his impressive balance during the session in Portugal</p>

<p>'I feel incredible and I'm determined to lose even more weight. I saw pictures of myself on the beach when lockdown ended and I came to Spain. I was shocked by how I looked. Now I just never want to go back to feeling that way.'  </p>

<p>'It was the best thing I've ever done. I've struggled with my weight for years but this has really changed my outlook. I'm free from drink and drugs still, which is a huge achievement. And making sure I lose weight and get healthier is an ongoing goal.' </p>

<p>The media personality had previously insisted the secret behind his epic five-stone weight loss earlier this year was low-calorie curry.</p>

<p>In we go! Arg was assisted by an instructor as he got into the water to begin his session on the board </p>

<p>Stroll: The former TOWIE star, 32, went shirtless in a pair of bright orange swimming shorts as he soaked up the sun</p>

<p>Practice makes perfect: Arg looked tentative at first but then got into the swing of the technique </p>

<p>Last year, James suffered two near-fatal overdoses at his home, with his then-girlfriend Gemma Collins calling emergency services after his family feared he was dead. </p>

<p>The Essex native turned his life around and is continuing his recovery after he flew to Thailand earlier this year to go to rehab for his drug and drink addiction.  </p>

<p>Things for James haven't been as promising in the romance department as he broke up with his partner Gemma, 39, earlier his summer after she revealed a string of abusive messages, purportedly sent to her by him prior to their split.</p>

<p>Stroll: He looked casual in a navy blue t-shirt, shorts and black Nike trainers as he worked up a sweat</p>

<p>Walk: Arg took in the beautiful views around the resort during his hike where he listened to music on his headphones</p>

<p>Fitness: Arg appeared to be taking his weight loss seriously as he worked up a sweat on his hike</p>

<p>It's understood the Jump star had made derogatory remarks abut her weight after she suggested that he had bought another woman dinner.  </p>

<p>The self-proclaimed diva decided to take some time off social media, citing that she was 'devastated' and 'heartbroken' by the exchange.</p>

<p>However after returning to the UK from her own Tenerife getaway, Gemma apologised to her former beau for releasing the messages.</p>

<p>Refreshing: At one point during the session James took a swim in the cool waters </p>

<p>Tired: At the end of the class he wearily made his way back to shore with the help of his instructor</p>

<p>Day out: Arg revealed he transformed his eating habits and lost two stone when he went on Jason Vale's retreat in Portugal in August</p>
