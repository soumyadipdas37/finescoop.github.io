<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves are reportedly prepared to open up discussions with manager Nuno Espirito Santo over a new deal.</p>

<p>The 46-year-old has received much praise for his work at the club since he first joined them back in 2017 when they were still in the Championship.</p>

<p>Now the Sun have reported that they want to tie down the Portuguese boss to a new deal.</p>

<p>Wolves are keen on opening discussions with boss Nuno Espirito Santo over a new contract</p>

<p>It is reported that executive chairman Jeff Shi is willing to offer Santo a three-year deal which will be worth around £4m. </p>

<p>Shi sees it as an imperative to tie down Santo's future, especially since he has entered the last year of his reported £60,000 a week deal. </p>

<p>Following Wolves defeat to Sevilla, Santo openly called for a major investment into his thin squad.</p>

<p>The club responded in turn by signing 18-year-old wonderkid Fabio Silva from Porto for a club-record £35m deal.</p>

<p>Wolves have jumped into the transfer market breaking their record for Fabio Silva of Porto</p>

<p>Wolves hope their new signings will tempt the Portuguese boss to sign a new deal at the club</p>

<p>They also made a bargain signing worth £1.8m for Lyon's experienced left-back Fernando Marcal.</p>

<p>It is also believed that they are closing in on a loan-swoop for 20-year-old Porto midfielder Vitor Ferreira.</p>

<p>Shi hopes that the club's move into the transfer market will help persuade Santo to sign a new contract with the West Midlands club.</p>

<p>Wolves will be hoping to push on in the Premier League this season after just missing out on a Europa League spot on goal difference for the upcoming season having finished in seventh.</p>
