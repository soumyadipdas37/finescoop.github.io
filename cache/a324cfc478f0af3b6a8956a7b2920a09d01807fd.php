<p>The animal was blown to pieces when guards shot its bombs before it could reach them as Governor Babagana Zulum returned to the Borno state capital of Maiduguri.</p>

<p>As the explosives detonated, militants appeared from cover and opened fire on the convoy.</p>

<p>Fortunately nobody in the convoy was injured in the attempt on the governor's life, the second in as many days in the war-ravaged northeast of the country.   </p>

<p>Zulum was returning from the town of Baga, 120 miles from the capital, where he was accompanying hundreds of residents who fled their homes in 2014 due to jihadist attacks.</p>

<p>On Friday, when the governor was on the road to the town, a ferocious ambush was launched on his convoy which left 30 dead. </p>

<p>'The terrorists made away with an armoured personnel carrier, a gun truck and six sports utility vehicles in the convoy,' a source told AFP. </p>

<p>Funerals were held for the soldiers on Saturday.</p>

<p>The IS-affiliated Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) group maintains most of its camps on islands in Lake Chad and the region is known as a bastion for the jihadists.</p>

<p>The militant group has recently intensified attacks on military and civilian targets in the region.</p>

<p>In July Zulum's convoy came under gun attack from ISWAP outside Baga, forcing him to cancel his trip to the town. </p>

<p>The decade-long insurgency in northeast Nigeria has killed 36,000 people and forced over 2 million from their homes.</p>

<p>Most of the displaced have been housed into squalid camps where they depend on food handouts from international charities. </p>

<p>Local authorities have been encouraging the displaced to go back to their homes despite concern from aid agencies of the security risks.</p>

<p>Zulum said last week that it was not sustainable to continue feeding the people of towns like Baga in refugee camps and that he wanted them to return to a 'dignified' life. </p>

<p>ISWAP splintered from the main Boko Haram group in 2016 and has gone on to be the dominant insurgent force in the region.</p>
