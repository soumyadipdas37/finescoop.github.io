<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Vatican has used its strongest language yet in opposition to euthanasia, calling it an 'act of homicide' that can never be justified or tolerated and 'intrinsically evil'.</p>

<p>As more countries consider legalising euthanasia or assisted suicide, a document released today said legislators and politicians who support such laws are 'accomplices'.</p>

<p>The Vatican told priests they should provide spiritual accompaniment to those who have expressed a desire to end their lives through assisted suicide or euthanasia.</p>

<p>But the document said priests could not be present at the time of euthanasia as 'that could be interpreted as approval of this action'.</p>

<p>The 20-page document, titled The Good Samaritan, was written by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's doctrinal office.</p>

<p>The Vatican has used its strongest language yet in opposition to euthanasia, calling it an 'act of homicide' that can never be justified or tolerated. Pictured: Pope Francis delivers his blessing as he recites the Angelus noon prayer from the window of his studio overlooking St Peter's Square, at the Vatican, on Sunday</p>

<p>It included past statements by the Roman Catholic Church on end of life issues but used tougher language.</p>

<p>The document reads: 'Euthanasia, therefore, is an intrinsically evil act, in every situation or circumstance. </p>

<p>'Euthanasia is an act of homicide that no end can justify and that does not tolerate any form of complicity or active or passive collaboration.'</p>

<p>The document takes into account medical advances, the advent of 'do not resuscitate' orders and legal approval for assisted suicide, as well as new Vatican perspectives on palliative care, including for children. </p>

<p>One section singled out lawmakers, saying that if they approve laws on euthanasia and assisted suicide they become 'accomplices of a grave sin that others will execute'.</p>

<p>Pope Francis (pictured on Sunday) has previously asked doctors to 'reject the temptation' to facilitate euthanasia and assisted suicide</p>

<p>Euthanasia involves a physician taking an active role in ending a patient's life whereas in assisted suicide, the doctor provides a lethal substance for the patient to self-administer.</p>

<p>Both are legal to various degrees in around 10 countries, including The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, and nine US states, as well as Washington DC.</p>

<p>In February, Portuguese legislators approved bills that would decriminalise euthanasia and assisted suicide. They have not yet become law. </p>

<p>Spain, another traditional Catholic country, is considering legalising euthanasia while New Zealand is due to hold a referendum on both in October.</p>

<p>Leading figures in the Catholic Church have consistently spoken out against assisted suicide, which is viewed as a violation of divine law.</p>

<p>While still Cardinal, Pope Benedict wrote in 2004: 'There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile Pope Francis, who succeeded Pope Benedict in 2013, has previously asked doctors to 'reject the temptation' to facilitate euthanasia and assisted suicide.</p>

<p>He has described euthanasia and abortion as evidence of today's 'throwaway culture', in which the sick, elderly and disabled are considered unworthy of life. </p>

<p>The document called legitimatising euthanasia or assisted suicide 'a sign of the degradation of legal systems'.</p>

<p>In a section addressed to Catholic health workers, the document said their cooperation 'must be excluded' because 'we must obey God rather than men.'</p>

<p>The 20-page document, titled The Good Samaritan, was written by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican's doctrinal office. Pictured: Rome's skyline is seen from the St. Damaso balcony at the Vatican on Wednesday, September 16</p>

<p>Governments 'must acknowledge the right to conscientious objection' by health care workers, it said.</p>

<p>The Vatican backed the use of hospice centres and palliative care, including deep sedation to reduce pain. </p>

<p>But it said such medication must never be used with the intent of hastening death.</p>

<p>And it called for the expansion of 'prenatal hospice centres' to provide medical, psychological and spiritual care to parents and children suffering pre-natal pathologies that are 'inconsistent with life'.</p>

<p>Rather than resorting to abortion, the Vatican said, providing this assistance 'helps the parents to handle their grief and to regard this experience not just as a loss, but as a moment in the journey of love which they have travelled together with their child'.</p>
