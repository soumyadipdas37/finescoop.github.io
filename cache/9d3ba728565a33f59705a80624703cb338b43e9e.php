<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Julian Assange's extradition hearing has been halted over fears a prosecuting lawyer may have been exposed to coronavirus.</p>

<p>The Wikileaks founder, 49, is wanted in the US for allegedly conspiring with army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to expose military secrets between January and May 2010.</p>

<p>The husband of a junior prosecuting lawyer started suffering 'Covid-like symptoms' and is currently awaiting the results of a test, a judge heard at a case management hearing at the Old Bailey. </p>

<p>Washington DC-based attorney Eric Lewis was due to testify today but District Judge Vanessa Baraitser excused him and called the hearing instead. </p>

<p>Julian Assange (pictured in 2017), 49, is wanted in the US for allegedly conspiring with army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to expose military secrets</p>

<p>Edward Fitzgerald, QC, for Assange, said: 'I have had the opportunity to speak to Mr Assange and Mr Lewis and we respectfully invite you not to go ahead until they have had a (test) result.</p>

<p>'We have to move ahead on the assumption they have Covid.</p>

<p>'Firstly, we shouldn't really be here today. Covid would be here in the court room and it is not possible to tell how far it has extended.'</p>

<p>He added that there were members of the team who were in a high risk category - meaning they would likely suffer severe symptoms if exposed to Covid.  </p>

<p>'Our client Mr Assange - whose vulnerabilities you are aware of - would be at risk because we have had to consult with him,' he said.</p>

<p>Supporters of WikiLeaks founder Assange protest outside the Old Bailey, the Central Criminal Court ahead of a hearing to decide whether Assange should be extradited to the United States, in London yesterday</p>

<p>'We reached a principle decision some time ago that this hearing shouldn't continue in the present circumstances.</p>

<p>'Trying to conduct this in a remote way would not be fair or appropriate.</p>

<p>'If the lawyer is negative we can carry on. If it is positive we can make submissions to you then.'</p>

<p>James Lewis, for the US government, appeared on the virtual link from his London flat.</p>

<p>He said: 'We agree with Mr Fitzgerald it would be best if we adjourn until Monday to know whether or not the test is positive.</p>

<p>'We are having a number of technical difficulties. All I can see is the back of Mr Fitzgerald's jacket frozen in mid-air and it is completely unsatisfactory to deal with it in that way.'</p>

<p>Judge Baraitser said she was told last night that one of the barristers in the case could have been exposed to coronavirus.</p>

<p>She added: 'I'm told it is anticipated that the testing process will take place today and the outcome will be known at some time tomorrow.</p>

<p>'I had intended to take matters one step at a time and to manage tomorrow's hearing over the video-link but I hear the objections now from both sides against that course of action.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's father John Shipton spoke to reporters outside the Old Bailey in London yesterday</p>

<p>'Can I make it clear if I accede to the request that does not indicate I have made an interest of justice decision going forward about attendance of parties attending by CVP in the future.</p>

<p>'I accept the hearing should be postponed until the outcome is known.</p>

<p>'I'm willing to accede for the time being to adjourn this case until Monday at 10am.'</p>

<p>Mr Lewis was due to tell the court about Assange's likely pre-trial conditions, sentence and place of imprisonment in the US should he be extradited and convicted.</p>

<p>The lawyer was to join professors Paul Rogers and Mark Feldstein, as well as Reprieve founder Clive Stafford Smith and journalist Trevor Timm in arguing the prosecution is politically motivated.</p>

<p>The attorney would also have attested to the difficulties of preparing a legal defence among a swathe of classified evidence, the document said.</p>

<p>He will instead be first up to give evidence on Monday morning should the hearing go ahead.</p>

<p>He is accused of publishing un-redacted US government documents and faces a maximum 175-year prison sentence if convicted.</p>

<p>The four week extradition hearing at the Old Bailey - sitting at Westminster Magistrates' Court continues on Monday.</p>
