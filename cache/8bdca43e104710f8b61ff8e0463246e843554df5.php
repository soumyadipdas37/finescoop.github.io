<p>Looking good: Lucie Donlan looked incredible as she took to the waves for a fun surf session in Newquay, Cornwall on Wednesday</p>

<p>Lucie wowed as she displayed her tanned, slender pins as she walked along the beach before wading into the sea.</p>

<p>The reality starlet allowed her blonde curls to cascade over her shoulders, while she went make-up free for the day.</p>

<p>Lucie later dried off and slipped into a white crop top and slouchy white jogging bottoms, showcasing her washboard abs as she did so.</p>

<p>The beauty looked content as she strolled along, with her surfboard tucked under her arm. </p>

<p>Surf's up: The surfer, 21, showcased her toned physique in a form-fitting black wetsuit as she happily rode the waves</p>

<p>Lucie's outing comes after she went public with her Love Island beau Luke at the start of July.</p>

<p>Soon after the announcement, Luke branded the surfer his 'partner in crime' in a sweet social media post.</p>

<p>The former heating engineer and the model looked loved-up as they shared a hug on the beach during a romantic surfing trip in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>Luke and Lucie sported matching wetsuits as they put on a cosy display in the image uploaded to the hunk's platform, which he captioned: 'My partner in crime.'</p>

<p>The surfer commented: 'Youuuu' with a heart-eyed emoji, while fellow Love Islander Luke Trotman, who confirmed the pair's romance days earlier, cheekily wrote: 'Double date but no surfing.' (sic) </p>

<p>Just hours after going Instagram official, the Luke's ex-girlfriend Demi Jones – who he was partnered up with on Love Island's winter 2020 series – appeared to make a thinly-veiled dig at her co-star as she liked a tweet about being 'better off alone'.</p>

<p>Going strong: Her outing comes after Lucie went public with Luke Mabbott in July, and soon after he branded her his 'partner in crime' in a sweet social media post</p>
