<p>Jamie Heywood, Uber regional general manager for northern and eastern Europe, said: 'Now that travel restrictions are easing and people are venturing out more, we want to help get the country moving safely again.</p>

<p>'Whether it's public transport, bike and car rentals, car rides or even a boat, users can now make almost any journey on the app, pushing us further towards our goal of ending the need for private car ownership.'</p>

<p>Uber also confirmed its new system would follow other car rental companies across the industry in regularly deep-cleaning all cars and implementing strong social distancing protocols.</p>

<p>The ride-sharing app said users would see the new service appear once they had updated to the latest version of the app, when the new Uber Rent option would appear.</p>
