<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Frank Lampard has hailed Thiago Silva's leadership qualities after the experienced defender joined Chelsea on a free transfer. </p>

<p>The former Paris Saint-Germain and Brazil captain sealed his move to Stamford Bridge this week on a one-year deal with an option for a second.</p>

<p>Silva, 35, will add some much-needed experience to Lampard's side going into the new campaign. </p>

<p>Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has praised the leadership qualities of defender Thiago Silva</p>

<p>Lampard told Chelsea's official website: 'We have a relatively young squad, we saw that last year, there were games afterwards when I was probably asking for more voice and some more leadership in different ways and he brings that naturally straightaway.'</p>

<p>Silva enjoyed a huge amount of success during his time at PSG, winning the league title seven times and the Coupe de France five times.</p>

<p>Having played more than 600 club games during his career in addition to making 89 appearances for Brazil, he should quickly become a key figure in the Chelsea dressing room. </p>

<p>Lampard says that Silva's experience will prove to be hugely valuable for his young squad</p>

<p>Silva captained Paris Saint-Germain and was previously captain of Brazil and AC Milan</p>

<p>Despite being in the latter stages of his career, Silva could help Chelsea to push on further this campaign.</p>

<p>Chelsea have been incredibly active in the transfer market, also bringing in Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Malang Sarr, with further arrivals expected to follow. </p>

<p>Chelsea were in pre-season action on Saturday, with Werner scoring in a 1-1 draw away to Brighton.  </p>
