<p>The 50-year-old Flipping Out alum returned to his first radio show since the procedure. </p>

<p>'First of all, I survived my surgery,' the the interior designer-house flipper revealed on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live. 'I still have my legs and I can walk, although I did use the walker on the first day.' </p>

<p>Recovering: Jeff Lewis returned to his first radio show since undergoing major surgery last Wednesday, after being diagnosed with the spinal cord disease Cervical Myelopathy just two weeks prior </p>

<p>Lewis sought help from a doctor after experiencing lower back and neck pain and instability in his legs.</p>

<p>The former Brave star also joked to his radio show cohosts, Megan Weaver and Doug Budin, their listeners overprepared him for the major surgery. </p>

<p>While he initially purchased an additional walker to have one on 'each floor' of his home, Lewis says he was walking on his own again 'by day two.' </p>

<p>In addition, he ceased the opportunity to thank fans that shared their experiences undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).</p>

<p>'First of all, I survived my surgery,' the the interior designer-house flipper revealed on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live. 'I still have my legs and I can walk, although I did use the walker on the first day'</p>

<p>Following his spine surgery, he praised the suggestion of a zero gravity chair and warnings to expect sleepless nights.   </p>

<p>Despite still navigating his pain, Lewis opted to look at the positive, telling Weaver and Budin he lost 'six and a half pounds and gained a quarter inch in height because of the implant.'  </p>

<p>'Do I look taller?' he quipped, before detailing his preparation for surgery and discovering he woke up saying a 'lot of inappropriate things.' </p>

<p>Exes: Lewis and Edwards welcomed Monroe in 2016 via surrogate before splitting in early 2019, after a decade together </p>

<p>According to the star, the physician's assistant, named Hannah, told his assistant Shane Douglas and ex Shane Anderson he was 'saying a lot of crazy things.'  </p>

<p>Unable to recount his specific conversations, the only thing Lewis could definitively remember was 'mentioning the word penis' and probably saying 'I'd still have sex with you anyway.'  </p>

<p>As his costars teased that they 'hope Hannah does not file a claim' because he 'could've sexually accosted her,' the father-of-one vocally cringed at the endless possibilities of what could've escaped his mouth.  </p>

<p>Second thoughts: Lewis confessed earlier this month on Andy Cohen's radio show that he had 'had feelings for [his ex Gage Edward] and I feel like I have regret...' but that nasty messages changed his feelings; shown in June 2018</p>

<p>'I'm so worried about the things I might've said because I was really messed up,' he confessed. </p>

<p>He crassly added: 'There's a humongous bruise, you can see it, it's huge and ugly on my bicep. And I'm wondering, did they have to restrain me? So I don't know what happened, I could've been sexually assaulted.' </p>

<p>In the final minutes of the segment, he also revealed he scaled back on his pain killers and muscle relaxers to return to the air.  </p>

<p>Dig: While recovering Lewis took a dig at his ex Gage Edwards, sharing a photoshopped image of Edwards unplugging a hospital machine as Lewis laid in bed</p>

<p>'I knew to start radio, I would probably need to kind of pair back, so yesterday I went from four pain pills to two pain pills a day,' he concluded. 'I went from three muscle relaxers to two. I feel good, but not too loopy loopy.' </p>

<p>Last week while recovering from the neck surgery, the radio host took a shot at his ex by sharing an edited meme image, showing his face photoshopped over a hospital patient.</p>

<p>His ex Edwards was edited to be standing over him declaring 'It's Monroe Edwards now b***h,' referring to their three-year-old daughter. </p>

<p>No thanks: The couple has since been in a bitter custody battle over their daughter since splitting</p>

<p>Edwards then unplugged the chord connected to hospital equipment. 'Thanks for all of the support,' Lewis captioned the photo.</p>
