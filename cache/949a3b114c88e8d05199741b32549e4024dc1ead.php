<p>The boys are being held at a youth detention centre and are expected to appear in court soon over the alleged gang-rape in Muldersdrift, near Johannesburg.  </p>

<p>The alleged rape is said to have taken place on an informal settlement, a type of slum-like housing where millions of people are thought to live in South Africa. </p>

<p>The girl's mother learned of the alleged attack from her nephew while braiding a customer's hair, according to Eyewitness News.  </p>

<p>The mother and daughter were taken to the police station where officers opened a rape investigation.</p>

<p>In a separate case, a 24-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping a five-year-old girl in Khutsong. </p>

<p>The man is accused of breaking into the child's home and kidnapping her after she and her older brother had been left alone. </p>

<p>The suspect was found after a 'lengthy search' while the mother could also face charges of child negligence, police say. </p>

<p>The UN has said that violence against women and girls is 'pervasive' in South Africa despite attempts at legal reforms. </p>

<p>Campaigners have dubbed the country the Republic of Sexual Abuse, adapting the formal name of the Republic of South Africa.  </p>

<p>To make matters worse, violence against women rose sharply after the end of a lockdown-related ban on alcohol sales earlier this year. </p>

<p>21 women and children were killed in the first three weeks after the sales of alcohol resumed in June, president Cyril Ramaphosa said.</p>

<p>Ramaphosa described the violence as 'another pandemic that is raging in our country, condemning the 'brutality that defies any form of comprehension'.   </p>
