<p>Emma and Kristen were both casual for the outing, donning simple leggings for the coffee break.</p>

<p>Despite the warm weather, Roberts decided to keep on a well-tailored jacket which concealed her burgeoning belly. She completed the look with sunglasses, her favorite croc-skin YSL purse, checkered slip-on sneakers, and of course a mask.</p>

<p>Kristen, on the other hand, went for sporty chic in Adidas trainers, their iconic tri-stripe leggings, and a cropped t-shirt.</p>

<p>The Twilight talent had her hair raked back into a messy half-ponytail, showing off her natural color as she appeared to be growing out a previous bleach job.</p>

<p>The actresses were joined by two friends. After getting their drinks the group gathered in the parking lot for a quick hang out. Emma was tickled by whatever Stewart had to say, flashing her sparkling Roberts smile during the chat. </p>
