<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> This was not Lockdown II: The Sequel. In some ways it was worse. The measures announced all felt so wretchedly authoritarian, like a call to arms for petty officialdom. So un-Boris.</p>

<p>Yet here he was, sounding as bossy as a bed and breakfast-owning old biddy in Birkenstocks.</p>

<p>No one took any cheer from Boris Johnson’s address to the nation last night.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister sat at a well-polished desk, a single Union Jack flag drooping reassuringly behind him.</p>

<p>Physically he looks in good nick. That jawline is sharper than it has been in decades. Still not quite capable of slicing ripe camembert, but give the guy a break.</p>

<p>Sombre: Boris Johnson addresses the British people </p>

<p>‘Covid,’ Boris began ominously, ‘is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime…’</p>

<p>We heard how he was calling time on pubs. Chucking-out time would now be 10pm. Wedding numbers would be slashed, the use of face masks expanded.</p>

<p>We were warned of tougher fines, stricter controls, tighter policing.</p>

<p>There was even a mention of the army being mobilised to take some of the burden off the plod. Nice.</p>

<p>Nothing says ‘UK open for business’ better than platoons of camouflaged commandos on the streets brandishing automatic weapons.</p>

<p>It was good day for giant turkeys at least. With numbers limited to six, no need for mum to go ordering any gargantuan- sized gobblers this Christmas. Tiny tiddlers all round.</p>

<p>‘Covid,’ Boris began ominously, ‘is the single biggest crisis the world has faced in my lifetime…’</p>

<p>For those thinking of flouting the rules, Johnson offered food for thought. ‘Your mild cough can be someone else’s death knell,’ he warned, his arms jabbing at the camera like a pair of jousting lances.</p>

<p>It is to the PM’s credit that he avoided coming over like an epaulette-laden Latin American dictator.</p>

<p>Absence of pomposity spares him of that. He spoke of being ‘deeply, spiritually reluctant to make any of these impositions’.</p>

<p>In the same situation, Tony Blair or even David Cameron might have come across a l i t t le too comfor table snatching away our basic freedoms. He ended with a Churchillian flourish which briefly soared.</p>

<p>‘Never in our history has our collective destiny and our collective health depended so completely on our individual behaviour,’ he said.</p>

<p>A throaty whisper promised us ‘great days ahead’. But language-wise, this was a speech free of frills. The seriousness of it all was striking.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister had already announced most of these measures earlier to Parliament.</p>

<p>That will have earned him a brief reprieve with Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who’s become increasingly ratty about these announcements being made on the telly.</p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Boris’s language was blood-and-thunder, his demeanour oddly chipper. ‘We have reached a perilous turning point,’ he informed the House. ‘This is the moment when we must act…’</p>

<p>To think it was less than two months ago that he stood on that same spot to announce that ‘our long period of hibernation’ was at an end. What a joyous day that was. Not so yesterday.</p>

<p>Sir Keir Starmer announced he was supporting the measures. I think he half-expected the chamber to erupt into applause. His main concern was that the furlough scheme was ending next month. </p>

<p>To think it was less than two months ago that he stood on that same spot to announce that ‘our long period of hibernation’ was at an end</p>

<p>Scrapping it in one fell swoop ‘would be a disaster’, he said.</p>

<p>Other opposition parties jumped on the same issue. The SNP’s Ian Blackford urged the Government ‘not to throw workers on the scrapheap’.</p>

<p>Green queen Caroline Lucas issued a plea on behalf of freelance workers.</p>

<p>Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey made a spectacle of himself, as ever, by trying to get Boris to issue the public an apology.</p>

<p>Last night felt eerily like a teetering point in the Boris Johnson premiership. By imposing such draconian new measures on a freedom-loving public – not to mention adopting such larynx-tightening forceful language – suggests no one realises this more than Boris himself.</p>

<p>Should his leadership begin to crumble over these next months, this will likely be the location on the map his critics mark with an X to signify where it all went drastically wrong.</p>

<p>He has asked the country for another six months of sacrifice. After that, I fear</p>

<p>that famous well of good will toward him will have run awfully dry...</p>
