<p>Rumours of his hidden fortunes have been circulating for years since his death.</p>

<p>Nephew Nicolas told Colombian TV channel Red+ Noticias he also found a gold pen, satellite phones, a typewriter, a camera and undeveloped film roll.</p>

<p>He said: 'Every time I sat in the dining room and looked towards the car park, I saw a man entering the place and disappearing.</p>

<p>The 'King of Cocaine' reportedly hid millions in his many properties across Colombia, including the Hacienda Napoles, his private estate which is now a theme park</p>

<p>'The smell [inside] was astonishing. A smell 100 times worse than something that had died.' </p>

<p>Many of the old notes stashed in the wall had decayed and were no longer usable.</p>

<p>Nicolas has been living in the apartment owned by his uncle for the past five years.    </p>

<p>Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was a Colombian drug trafficker.</p>

<p>During his time at the helm of the Medellin Cartel he controlled over 80 per cent of the cocaine shipped to the US. </p>

<p>This earned him the rank of one of Forbes Magazine’s ten wealthiest people in the world. </p>

<p>Escobar entered the cocaine trade in the early 1970s, collaborating with other criminals to form the Medellin Cartel.</p>

<p>Despite his role as a drug lord Escobar earned popularity by sponsoring charity projects and soccer clubs.</p>

<p>However terror campaigns run by Escobar resulted in the murder of thousands turned the public against him.  </p>

<p>By the mid-1980s, Pablo Escobar had an estimated net worth of $30 billion and cash was so prevalent that Escobar purchased a Learjet for the sole purpose of flying his money.  </p>

<p>More than 15 tons of cocaine were reportedly smuggled each day, netting the Cartel as much as $420 million a week.</p>

<p>Colombian law enforcement finally caught up to Pablo Escobar on December 2, 1993 in a middle-class neighborhood in Medellin. </p>

<p>A firefight ensued and, as Escobar tried to escape across a series of rooftops, he and his bodyguard were shot and killed. </p>
