<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lionel Messi's former agent says the Barcelona legend came close to following Cesc Fabregas to Arsenal back in 2003.</p>

<p>Fabian Soldini says former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger identified Fabregas, Messi and Gerard Pique as potential signings when they were academy prospects.</p>

<p>Wenger succeeded in luring Fabregas to Arsenal, while Pique joined Manchester United, though Messi opted to stay at Barcelona. </p>

<p>Lionel Messi's former agent says he was tempted to join Cesc Fabregas at Arsenal in 2003</p>

<p>Wenger succeeded in luring Fabregas to Arsenal and also attempted to persuade Messi </p>

<p>Messi stayed at Barca but the pair were reunited at the Nou Camp when Fabregas returned</p>

<p>But Soldini says Messi was tempted by the prospect of a move to the Emirates such was the closeness of his friendship with Fabregas,</p>

<p> '[Messi] was tempted to go to Arsenal, but he didn't go,' Soldini told Marca.</p>

<p> 'I remember the day that Cesc asked to leave [Barcelona]. Messi was also asked to go, but he didn't want to leave.'  </p>

<p>Wenger himself revealed last year that he attempted to sign Messi but admitted that the Argentine was 'untouchable' at that time.</p>

<p>Messi and Fabregas were originally team-mates in one of the great La Masia youth teams</p>

<p>Wenger told BeIN Sports.: 'We were in discussions with [Messi] when we bought Fabregas, because Messi played [with him].</p>

<p>'You can realise sometimes what fantastic youth teams you had before when you're a club like Barcelona. In the same team, Messi, [Gerard] Pique and Fabregas.</p>

<p>'Pique and Fabregas came to England [with Manchester United and Arsenal respectively], Messi stayed in Spain. We were interested in him, but he was untouchable at the time.'  </p>
