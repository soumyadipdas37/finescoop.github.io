<p>But lifting his wife’s spirits didn’t appear to be in Jamie Cullum’s repertoire – at least if these series of pictures are anything to go by.</p>

<p>The cheap decorations hanging off a plastic Christmas tree are unlikely to have helped her mood as she sat at a table with the jazz star. Even a large glass of what appeared to be gin and tonic failed to cheer her up.</p>

<p>But appearances can be deceptive. For starters, December 25 hadn’t come early for the pair – instead they were taking part in a photoshoot for a festive campaign in a restaurant last week.</p>

<p>Dressed up to the nines, Miss Dahl, 43, struck a series of poses for a camera crew shooting from outside Odette’s restaurant in the celebrity haunt of Primrose Hill, North London.</p>

<p>The cheap decorations hanging off a plastic Christmas tree are unlikely to have helped her mood as she sat at a table with Jamie Cullum. Even a large glass of what appeared to be gin and tonic failed to cheer her up</p>

<p>But appearances can be deceptive. For starters, December 25 hadn’t come early for the pair – instead they were taking part in a photoshoot for a festive campaign in a restaurant last week</p>

<p>Onlookers couldn’t help but take a peek after seeing the crowds of production staff on the street outside. It’s a mystery as to what campaign Miss Dahl was filming with jazz star Cullum, 41 – famously seven inches shorter than his 5ft 11in wife. Marks &amp; Spencer denied the couple are involved in its festive advert, while sources at John Lewis said the same.</p>

<p>Miss Dahl, who has two daughters Lyra, nine and seven-year-old Margot, with Cullum, has carved herself a career in food after taking a step back from modelling.</p>

<p>The granddaughter of children’s writer Roald Dahl was a contributing editor at Waitrose food magazine and wrote a cookbook, Miss Dahl’s Voluptuous Delights. </p>
