<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Official data from the Environment Agency reveals no river or lake in England is in 'good health' due to high levels of chemical pollution. </p>

<p>Figures were last published in 2016 and at the time 97 per cent of surface water was ranked 'good' when considering levels of chemicals from households and farms. </p>

<p>However, stricter tests have been developed to help spot signs of chemical pollution in marine animals and exposed the shocking state of our nation's waterways. </p>

<p>Conservationists are calling for urgent action and increased funding to tackle the issue.  </p>

<p>While chemical pollution is revealed as ubiquitous, overall health has failed to improve despite a Government pledge that all waters will be in good health by 2027.</p>

<p>Measurements taken last year and published today show only 16 per cent of waters in England received a 'good' rating for overall ecological health.</p>

<p>This is the exact same as it was in 2016, a long way from the lofty progress needed to reach the targets set four years ago by DEFRA.</p>

<p>Experts now say the 2027 target is 'all but unachievable'. </p>

<p>The figures also show that English waters are among some of the worst in Europe, with a European average of 40 per cent surface water bodies in good health.</p>

<p>Scottish rivers and lakes scored 65.7 per cent while almost half (46 per cent) of Welsh waterways and 31 per cent of those in Northern Ireland were deemed 'good'.  </p>

<p>Plastic pollution eaten by seabirds releases 'potentially harmful' chemicals within their stomachs, a study has found. </p>

<p>Increasing amounts of plastic are ending up polluting the world's oceans and beaches — where birds often confuse them for food.</p>

<p>Eaten debris can cause blockages and remain in the intestine for long periods.  </p>

<p>Environment Minister Rebecca Pow said: 'We need to go further and faster on reducing the environmental impact from storm overflows and other sources of pollution including chemicals and agriculture.</p>

<p>'More needs to be done urgently, and I met with water companies earlier this month to set out the high expectations this government has for our water environment, including in particular chalk streams.</p>

<p>'These results show we have a long way to go, with a new way of testing for chemicals more accurately reflecting what is in our water environment.</p>

<p>'While it's not comfortable reading, this will allow us to plan more effectively to tackle the scourge of pollution.'</p>

<p>The figures come after Environment Agency chief executive Sir James Bevan raised the possibility of reforming the directive.  </p>

<p>But environmental groups warn say water health should be a top priority for regulators. </p>

<p>Richard Benwell, chief executive of the Wildlife and Countryside Link coalition of conservation groups, said: 'Chemicals, sewage, manure and plastic are polluting our rivers, invasive weeds are choking them, and climate change and over-abstraction are drying them out.</p>

<p>'Urgent investment is needed now to turn our suffering waters into thriving blue corridors for wildlife.'</p>
