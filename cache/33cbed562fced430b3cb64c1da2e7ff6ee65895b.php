<p>Olivia previously had her own reality show with ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes called Crackin' On.</p>

<p>However, their relationship took a turn for the worse when Chris, 27, broke up with her on camera, telling her the relationship wasn't making him happy anymore. </p>

<p>Olivia then reunited with Bradley, whom she was with before Love Island, while Chris found love with his now ex-girlfriend Jesy Nelson. </p>

<p>Speaking to OK! magazine last week, Olivia revealed that her wedding plans were thrown up in the air when the coronavirus pandemic hit. </p>

<p>She explained: 'We had our hearts set on a destination wedding, but I’m opening up to the idea of a UK wedding because we want to get married next year and definitely can’t afford to go into quarantine for two weeks.</p>

<p>'I’m going to look at some UK venues and see if they can turn my head.' </p>
