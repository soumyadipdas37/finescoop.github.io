<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bruno Fernandes insists he has quickly repaired relations with Victor Lindelof after their furious row on the pitch following Sevilla's match-winner in the Europa League last month. </p>

<p>The Manchester United pair were caught on camera shouting at each other following Luuk de Jong's winner in the semi-finals in Cologne, with Lindelof appeared to be telling Fernandes 'f*** you' followed by 'Filho da Puta' in Portuguese to his midfield team-mate - which translates as 'son of a b****'.</p>

<p>United crashed out, losing 2-1, and now Portuguese midfielder Fernandes elaborated on the aftermath and his close relationship with Swedish defender Lindelof.  </p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes and Victor Lindelof had a huge row on the pitch after Sevilla's match-winner</p>

<p>Fernandes played down the row  and now adds that his relationship with Lindelof is good </p>

<p>'He is one of the people with whom I have the best relationship in the club, also because he speaks Portuguese, and as everyone saw he speaks well,' Fernandes told Portuguese outlet A Bola. </p>

<p>'Those were obviously the first words he learned in Portugal, it is always what we teach them.</p>

<p>'But it was a game situation that none took to heart. It ended and we went directly to our countries, he to Sweden and I to Portugal.</p>

<p>'At the farewell we hugged, we leaned our heads and didn't even need to talk to each other. </p>

<p>Lindelof reportedly told midfielder Fernandes he was a 'son of a b****' in Portuguese </p>

<p>'We stayed there for those two seconds hugging and we realised what we wanted to say to each other.' </p>

<p>Straight after the match, Fernandes played down the incident: 'It is normal when you concede a goal, everyone was mad.</p>

<p>'It was not about me or Victor, what happened is nothing. It was normal, it is about looking out for each other. It will happen in a lot more teams too.' </p>
