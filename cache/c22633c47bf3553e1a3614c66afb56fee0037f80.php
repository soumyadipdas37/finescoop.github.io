<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Philippe Coutinho will return to the Nou Camp next season as Barcelona rule out another loan move for the 28-year-old.</p>

<p>Barca manager Ronald Koeman wants to keep the Brazilian, who helped Bayern Munich smash his parent club 8-2 in the Champions League quarter-finals before going on to lift the trophy with the German side. </p>

<p>The Catalan giants will only consider selling Coutinho if a club offers a substantial fee to take the midfielder on permanently, according to Marca. </p>

<p>Attacking midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, will now stay at Barcelona for the coming season</p>

<p>However, given the financial ramifications of the coronavirus pandemic, Barcelona are unlikely to receive an offer which meets their demands.</p>

<p>Instead, Koeman plans to utilise the former Liverpool man as a central midfielder next season, rather than playing him as winger like Ernesto Valverde had previously done. </p>

<p>Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman wants to play the Brazilian as a central midfielder next season</p>

<p>Coutinho scored twice for Bayern Munich against Barcelona during their 8-2 thrashing </p>

<p>Coutinho’s future had looked bleak at Barca, as the Brazilian playmaker struggled to impress since making his move to Barcelona in 2018 after leaving Liverpool in a £145m deal.</p>

<p>Following a lacklustre debut season at the Nou Camp, Coutinho was shipped out on loan to Bayern Munich.</p>

<p>Despite scoring for Bayern during their 8-2 thrashing of Barca – which led to Quique Setien being sacked – the German giants turned down the opportunity to sign Coutinho permanently for £108million.</p>

<p>That had left the door open for potential suitors to snap the 28-year-old up, but appointment of Koeman has now changed the Brazilian’s fate.      </p>

<p>Coutinho had previously been linked with a move to the Premier League, with Frank Lampard's Chelsea offering Barcelona a deal. However, the midfielder is now back in Spain training with Barcelona ahead of next season.</p>
