<p>A year on from losing her first-born baby, nine-year-old Kala is pictured playing with her cheeky baby, yet unnamed, at Bristol Zoo.   </p>

<p>The cheeky tot - born on August 19 - gazed up at its mother with adoring eyes, but not before trying to steal some of her lunch. </p>

<p>Luckily, hungry Kala manages to convince her baby that a cuddle with her and some milk is a much better option than her own snack. </p>

<p>The pair's beautiful bond was captured on camera by a zoo photographer when the baby was less than two weeks old, as Kala brought her out to enjoy the sunshine. </p>

<p>Bristol Zoo revealed that nine-year-old Kala gave birth naturally overnight while the father Jock was just a few metres away and the rest of the family troop nearby. </p>

<p>Keepers arrived to find the little gorilla nestling in its mother's arms.  </p>

<p>Curator of Mammals at Bristol Zoo Lynsey Bugg said: 'We are all thrilled. There is something very special about seeing a newborn baby gorilla, they are such an iconic and charismatic species.' </p>

<p>Last September, Kala's baby died when it was just under a week old. </p>

<p>The baby girl was delivered by emergency caesarean section due to Kala having a low-lying placenta which blocked the birth canal and prevented the baby from being born naturally. </p>

<p>Despite keepers and in-house vets closing the Zoo's Gorilla House to give the mother and baby time and space to bond, the baby sadly died just a few days after failing to thrive. </p>

<p>Fortunately, Kala's pregnancy this time around has been much happier, and the new mum and her bundle of joy clearly already enjoy a beautiful bond.</p>

<p>The baby gorilla joins a troop of six gorillas at the zoo, which are part of a breeding programme to help safeguard the future of western lowland gorillas.</p>

<p>Western lowland gorillas are critically endangered primates from Cameroon, in the west Central Africa region.</p>

<p>Many gorillas in the wild are shot by hunters for the bush meat trade which thrives in towns and cities.</p>

<p>Bristol Zoo Gardens is actively involved in ensuring there is a strong population in human care.</p>

<p>Lowland gorillas, which can weigh up to 400lb as adults and stand 6ft tall, are usually not aggressive - unless disturbed. </p>
