<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Olivier Giroud insists he does not feel threatened by Chelsea signing Timo Werner for £53million. </p>

<p>The striker lit up the Bundesliga and offered a reminder of his class with a goal in Spain's 1-1 draw with Germany on Thursday night in the Nations League. </p>

<p>But Giroud is relaxed about the superstar addition to Stamford Bridge despite the likelihood that Werner will slot straight into Frank Lampard's side. </p>

<p>Chelsea striker Olivier Giroud insists he is not concerned by the club signing Timo Werner </p>

<p>He said: 'In every big club, there's competition, and it always motivated me to fight for my spot,' he told reporters while on international duty with France.</p>

<p>'Now, I'm not naive and I know that the club bought Werner to put him on the pitch. One thing's for sure: we don't have the same profile, he likes to go on the sides, he did it with his club and his national team.</p>

<p>'If it was a striker with a similar profile, I would have been more worried, but I think with the different games and the different teams we'll play.</p>

<p>'The coach will choose different tactical systems and I really hope I'll play, following what I did last year.'</p>

<p>The German scored for his country in the Nations League 1-1 draw against Spain on Thursday</p>

<p>Giroud and Tammy Abraham competed for the central striking role in the team last season.</p>

<p>When play returned after the hiatus for coronavirus, the Frenchman scored seven times in 12 games to reestablish himself in the first team. </p>

<p>And he admitted his relationship with Lampard has evolved: 'My relationship with the coach has changed, clearly,' Giroud added. 'When we were looking to find a solution for me leaving, I started to know him better. We had a few one-on-ones and I think he started to know me better as well, so it was positive.  </p>

<p>Giroud thinks they are different kinds of players positionally so Werner is not a threat</p>

<p>'We trust each other, he clearly told me I would have a chance after the lockdown. So, I gave his confidence back on the pitch.</p>

<p>'He knows my values and my professionalism, he said it in the press.</p>

<p>'I have a good relationship with him, [but] it doesn't mean he'll start me every game. I have to perform during training to be in the starting line-up.'     </p>
