<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It's been one of the most explosive seasons of The Bachelor to date.</p>

<p>And now host Osher Günsberg has teased their could finally be a reunion show on the cards, after fans in their masses begged to see what happened next with Locky Gilbert and his winner Irena Srbinovska.</p>

<p>On Thursday, Osher posted on Twitter: 'If ever there was a season to do a reunion show, it would be this season. #TheBachelorAU.'</p>

<p>Could a reunion be on the cards? On Thursday night, host Osher Günsberg teased that one day such a show could exist, after fans in their masses begged to see what was going on with Locky Gilbert and Irena Srbinovska (pictured)</p>

<p>A fan had responded to the Tweet, asking the host: 'Why no after the final rose or women tell all? The ending to the show feels like it’s incomplete #bachelorau.'</p>

<p>But Osher insisted that he'd pitched such a thing many times to Channel 10, saying: 'We pitch it every year, but we've only got it up a few times. #thebachelorau.'</p>

<p>Adding more fuel to the fire, Comedia Urzila Carlson wrote to Osher: 'Make it so!!! I want to be there in the room for it! I’ll quarantine again,'</p>

<p>'Wouldn't that be something?' Host Osher Günsberg made it clear he's been fighting for a reunion show</p>

<p>'Wouldn't that be something?' Osher said he'd 'take a run' at trying to get the show going for season nine</p>

<p>To which he quipped: 'Wouldn't that be something? I'll take another run at if for season 9 ... #thebachelorau.'</p>

<p>The tease left fans hungry for a drama-filled reunion show - with many baffled why there isn't one in place already.</p>

<p>'Yes!! Please do an After the Final Rose. One of the best parts of the US bachie,' one wrote, while another added: 'Can we PLEASE make this a thing from now on. We need the drama.'</p>

<p>'Can we PLEASE make this a thing!' Fans were quick to agree with Osher, and begged for a reunion show to take place</p>

<p>The reunion would certainly make for interesting viewing, as Locky had told both Irena and Bella Varelis that he'd fallen in love with them before the tense finale aired.</p>

<p>And, like any season, rumours also ran rife that Irena and Locky had broken up after the show aired.</p>

<p>However, on Thursday night they did post a sweet video together seemingly confirming their relationship is still going strong.</p>

<p>'We're SO excited for the future,' Irena, 31, gushed. 'It's been such a long process and now we finally get to be together, and finally get to start our lives together.'</p>

<p>Locky, 30, added: 'It's been so long and now we finally get to tell everyone we're in love, and just get on with our normal life!' </p>

<p>Adorable: The happy couple shared a sweet smooch on the sofa as they addressed viewers for the very first time since the final</p>
