<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ivanka Trump traveled to Central Florida on Wednesday, stopping at the Asian Pacific Americans for Trump office in Orlando, before a 'fireside chat' staged for Trump supporters.</p>

<p>The 38-year-old, one of the most poised and diplomatic members of the Trump campaign, wore a face mask throughout the majority of her visit.</p>

<p>Arriving at the Asian Pacific Americans for Trump campaign headquarters, in the Pine Hills district of the city, she thanked the several dozen assembled activists for their work.</p>

<p>She said millions like them gave 'their time, their energy, their resources - because they know what's at stake.'   </p>

<p>Ivanka Trump traveled to Florida on Wednesday, campaigning in Orlando on behalf of her father</p>

<p>The 38-year-old's first stop was the Asian Pacific Americans for Trump office in the Pine Hills district of Orlando</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump met with many of the volunteers and thanked them for all their work on her father's behalf</p>

<p>Everyone inside the Orlando campaign center appeared to be wearing face masks, in contrast to her father's rallies</p>

<p>Thuy Lowe, who guided her around the room, said the volunteers included many Vietnamese Americans who have never voted before despite living in the U.S. for nearly 50 years.</p>

<p>'They may not speak English very well, but they understand that they're coming to register to vote for the first time because of President Trump,' Lowe said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. </p>

<p>Trump then signed the wall at the back of the small office - following in the footsteps of her brother Eric, who two weeks ago did the same thing.</p>

<p>The first daughter then crossed town to the Citrus Club, a private member's club on the 18th floor of a tower in downtown Orlando.  </p>

<p>Trump was welcomed to the site and told that those campaigning would ensure her father won four more years</p>

<p>Trump signed her name on their supporters' wall, next to that of her brother Eric Trump, who visited two weeks earlier</p>

<p>Trump was interviewed on stage by Mercades Schlapp, who served as the White House Director of Strategic Communications until 2019, and is now employed by the re-election campaign.</p>

<p>Schlapp, who is from Miami, asked Trump what she thought were the president's greatest accomplishments in the last four years.</p>

<p>Trump said she believed his most important achievements included moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, tax cuts, de-regulation and paid family leave.</p>

<p>'As he likes to say, he's kept more promises than he's made, which is actually true,' she said.</p>

<p>Trump refused to address the chaotic debate of Tuesday night, and nor did she respond when Schlapp mentioned Biden several times.</p>

<p>Instead, Trump preferred to speak about the economy, saying the country's business outlook was 'amazing' in January, before the start of the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>

<p>'When the president's policies started really kicking in, renegotiating trade deals, tax reform, tax cuts, energy independence - the economy started just soaring,' she said.</p>

<p>After 'this plague descended on us,' she cited the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program in the CARES Act as a major help for small businesses in the state.</p>

<p>'In 14 days, two weeks, the SBA issued more loans than in the 14 years prior,' she said. </p>

<p>'So it's extraordinary. And bring it back down to the state level, that in Florida alone protected 3.2 million jobs of people employed by close to a half a million small businesses here in the state.'</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump then went on to downtown Orlando, where she was interviewed on stage by Mercedes Schlapp</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump beamed as she took off her face mask when approaching the stage, having worn it for her prior event</p>

<p>The Citrus Club, a private member's club on the 18th floor of a tower in downtown Orlando, served as the venue</p>

<p>Trump did not discuss Biden, or the previous night's fiery debate - preferring to emphasize the administration's achievements </p>

<p>The day before her visit, Disney announced the loss of 28,000 jobs in its theme parks - a tough blow to the resort city.</p>

<p>Disney’s theme parks in California and Florida employed roughly 110,000 people before the pandemic. The job cuts will come from both resorts. </p>

<p>Asked why the Trumps got involved in government, she said: 'This country has given so much to our family. And the opportunity to give back is a privilege.'</p>

<p>She left immediately after the discussion with Schlapp - taking no questions from reporters.</p>

<p>The first daughter's visit comes two days before the president's visit on Friday to Seminole County.</p>
