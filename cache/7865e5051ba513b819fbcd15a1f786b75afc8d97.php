<p>Behind the scenes: Holly Hagan spilled Geordie Shore's secrets as she took to Instagram on Tuesday during a Q and A</p>

<p>Responding to one fan who asked 'how many nights out did you usually during a series?', Holly said: 'About 36-40ish! We filmed for 6 weeks with one down night per week. Not sure how we're still alive tbh'. </p>

<p>Another follower asked: 'Could you ask producers not to air something if you'd one something bad when drunk? </p>

<p>'Lol, no never. We wouldn't have had a show if we were allowed to do that.' </p>

<p>Raucous behaviour: The reality star, 28, rose to fame as one of the original members of Geordie Shore (pictured in 2012)</p>

<p>Shocking: Holly said she would go on 40 nights out over a six week period during filming</p>

<p>Fiesty: Holly also discussed how arguments were resolved </p>

<p>Holly said as to why a new girl faced more animosity when they joined compared to a new male cast member: 'Because we were jealous and scared the boys we fancied were going to fancy them. </p>

<p>'We were very insecure and young. Thankfully we got past all that.' </p>

<p>'How did you manage to get over the arguments you had with people? I keep grudges!!', queried another. </p>

<p>Rival: Holly said as to why a new girl faced more animosity when they joined compared to a male cast member: 'Because we were jealous and scared the boys were going to fancy them'</p>

<p>Holly said: 'This was actually a really good lesson in communication. Usually if you argue with a friend you would text the next day to apologise.</p>

<p>'Well we had to face each other talk in person which actually helped us to articulate ourselves and learn how to apologise and accept wrong doings.</p>

<p>'We were all a family and brothers and sisters, argue like cat and dog but always make up. That's what it was like with us.' </p>

<p>Money, money, money: Holly also revealed the huge pay difference between male and female cast members when they were booked for personal appearances</p>

<p>Original: When asked if the producers tried to persuade Holly to stay, she replied: 'God yes!'</p>

<p>When asked if she took drugs to cope with the endless night outs, Holly said:  'We obviously would never be allowed drugs on the show we would be sacked instantly.' </p>

<p>Holly also revealed the huge pay difference between male and female cast members when they were booked for personal appearances. </p>

<p>She claimed clubs would book the original boys such as Gary Beadle for £1,000 plus while she would only be paid £250 for the same job. </p>

<p>Audition: Holly also shared what producers asked when interviewing potential cast members for the show</p>

<p>When asked if the producers tried to persuade Holly to stay, she replied: 'God yes! </p>

<p>'They tried so hard to get me to stay and I imagine the same happened with everyone else. I said I wanted to leave at the spur of the moment.</p>

<p>'I left because Kyle was told to leave and I was sick of fighting for him to be back on the show. I felt like I was being treated so unfairly but looking back now those producers were trying to desperately to get me away from him so I could be better. </p>

<p>'I'd lost so much of myself and I couldn't see it but they were looking from the outside in. </p>

<p>'I don't for one second regret leaving though. I needed to sort my life out off camera and find myself again.' </p>

<p>Holly made her first appearance on MTV hit reality TV show Geordie Shore on the first episode of Series one making her one of the original cast members. </p>

<p>During her time on the show she embarked on relationships with other cast members such as James Tindale, Scott Timlin and Kyle Christie. </p>

<p>After making 111 appearances, Holly left the show in the Series 13 finale which aired on 20, December 2016. </p>
