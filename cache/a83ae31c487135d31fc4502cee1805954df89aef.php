<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Some of Britain's most recognisable faces have joined the Mail on Sunday's war on toxic US food and we're now calling on our readers to do the same.</p>

<p>Celebrities including chef Jamie Oliver, fitness guru Joe Wicks and BBC Countryside presenter Anita Rani have urged Boris Johnson to block sub-standard foods from flooding into the UK under post-Brexit trade deals. </p>

<p>The move comes as International Trade Secretary Liz Truss faces growing Parliamentary pressure to bolster protections against poor quality foreign food – and save British farms from being put out of business by cheap imports.</p>

<p>This newspaper is today urging readers who back the campaign to send a version of the letter to their local Tory MP, as Opposition MPs are already expected to support moves to protect standards</p>

<p>In a crunch Commons debate expected within the next fortnight, MPs will vote on new plans to give watchdogs on the Trade and Agriculture Commission the power to enforce high food standards.</p>

<p>In a heartfelt open letter, the group argues that 'the British public cares deeply' about these issues – a point emphasised by a Mail on Sunday poll today which shows an overwhelming majority of voters want our high food standards protected in future trade agreements. </p>

<p>The Deltapoll survey reveals that 68 per cent of people believed the most important priority for Britain was to maintain high standards for food, even if that mean some trade deals were not possible as a result.</p>

<p>Only one in five (21 per cent) thought that compromising on standards was acceptable to get a deal over the line.</p>

<p>This newspaper is today urging readers who back the campaign to send a version of the letter to their local Tory MP, as Opposition MPs are already expected to support moves to protect standards. </p>

<p>MPs will vote in the coming weeks on two amendments to the Agriculture Bill - one to keep out food imports that do not meet the UK's world-class standards, and the other to give Parliament a final say over future trade deals and create a permanent independent food trade watchdog. </p>

<p>As things stand the Government is telling Tory MPs not to back the amendments to the Agriculture Bill. Below is a list of Conservative MPs you can lobby with our letter. </p>
