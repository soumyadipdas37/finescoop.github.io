<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Perth drivers have been put to the test with a road rules quiz asking if a driver can make a full U-turn at a roundabout while using the left hand lane. </p>

<p>The question was posted on Facebook by Transport WA on Tuesday with an image showing a red car in the left lane indicating to make a full turn on the roundabout.  </p>

<p>The arrows underneath the car indicate that the vehicle can only turn left or continue straight on the roundabout.</p>

<p>'Is the red car legally allowed to make a full turn on the roundabout from their position in the left lane?' WA Transport asked. </p>

<p>Is the red car legally allowed to make a full turn on the roundabout from their position in the left lane?</p>

<p>According to the road rules, drivers are not allowed to make a full turn at a multi-lane roundabout.</p>

<p>They can only use the left lane to turn off at the first exit or to go straight ahead. </p>

<p>Is it legal for a car to make a full turn on the roundabout while in the left lane?</p>

<p>Now share your opinion</p>

<p>The majority of residents got the question right, saying it was not was legal for the car to make the full turn. </p>

<p>'No they can't from the left lane, only from the right lane,' one person wrote. </p>

<p>'I'm going with no. They should be in the right lane and indicate left 90 degrees prior to exit,' another commented. </p>

<p>'It would depend on the markings and signage at the roundabout. In this case no,' someone else wrote. </p>

<p>'No. That lane is marked for left turns and straight on only. To complete a U turn at this roundabout, they would need to enter the roundabout in the right lane,' another commented. </p>

<p>Other social media users joked that Perth drivers don't follow road rules and would make the illegal turn.</p>

<p>'Of course they can...So long as they give you the ''my bad'' wave after they cut you off,' one joked. </p>

<p>'Hell yeah, just chuck the hazards on and everyone will move,' another commented.  </p>
