<p>THE BOY IN THE FIELD</p>

<p>by Margot Livesey (Sceptre £17.99, 272 pp)</p>

<p>This is the kind of book you ration yourself reading because you don't want to get to the end. </p>

<p>It opens dramatically with a badly injured teenager being found by three siblings walking home from school.</p>

<p>The previously solid Oxford suburbs never feel the same afterwards and Matthew, Duncan and Zoe start to see what's hidden in everything from their parents' marriage to their own identities. </p>

<p>I loved the boho-intellectual setting; their solicitor mother does classes in Ancient Greek and Dad is a hipster blacksmith.</p>

<p>The best character is Lily the dog who always knows what to do. A gripping, beautifully written novel showing the light and shade of modern family life.</p>

<p>The Readers' Room, by Antoine Laurain (Gallic £14.99, 176 pp)</p>

<p>THE READERS' ROOM</p>

<p>by Antoine Laurain (Gallic £14.99, 176 pp)</p>

<p>J'adore Antoine and his contemporary French comedies. In this, Violaine, a pretty and clever book editor, heads up the eponymous room at her publishers' office. </p>

<p>They scan unsolicited manuscripts for signs of genius, and Sugar Flowers is so good it's a smash hit and listed for a literary honour. </p>

<p>Except there are two big problems. The writer has vanished and the book's plot, a murder thriller, exactly echoes some real-life killings.</p>

<p>Is there a connection between author and murders and how do they link to Violaine?</p>

<p>The plot blends mystery with comedy to great effect and, as ever, Laurain has fun at the expense of his countrymen.</p>

<p>The literary world appears in all its mockable glory.</p>

<p>Long Live The Post Horn!, by Vigdis Hjorth (Verso £10.99, 208 pp</p>

<p>LONG LIVE THE POST HORN!</p>

<p>by Vigdis Hjorth (Verso £10.99, 208 pp)</p>

<p>In theory, a novel about a Norwegian trade union's responses to an EU free-competition postal directive might not sound very promising.</p>

<p>In practice though, it's a wry and thoughtful take on contemporary life and love.</p>

<p>PR consultant Ellinor feels distant from her boyfriend and her family — it's like she's looking on at her own life.</p>

<p>Then, when the death of a colleague pitches the postal directive brief on to her desk, her detachment becomes a determination to defend Norway's letterboxes.</p>

<p>She starts taking an interest in life again — it's all about communication, see . . .</p>

<p>Full of gorgeous Scandi gloom and bleak truths about human relationships, this often very funny novel is perfect for moody autumn.</p>
