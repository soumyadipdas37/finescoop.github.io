<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A doctor has shut down coronavirus conspiracy theorists with a factual review debunking a popular post on social media.</p>

<p>Dr Sara Hassan uploaded a picture of a misinformed analysis of COVID-19 deaths on her Facebook page on Sunday.</p>

<p>The post claims only six per cent of America's 153,504 coronavirus deaths were actually caused by COVID-19, as 94 per cent of deaths had additional causes of death along with the deadly disease.</p>

<p>'I'm getting on this early because this type of misinformation and outright deliberate mischaracterisation of the facts is already making the rounds amongst conspiracy theorists hell-bent on twisting facts to suit their agenda,' Dr Hassan's post reads.</p>

<p>Dr Sara Hassan (pictured) shared misinformed data of COVID-19 death statistics on her Facebook page Sunday</p>

<p>The post (pictured) claimed those with who died from additional causes of death could not be included in the coronavirus death tally</p>

<p>'Those who spread these mistruths have one intention: to attempt to throw doubt about COVID deaths, minimise the seriousness of the pandemic, and ultimately encourage people to revolt against any mitigation put in place to prevent further deaths.'</p>

<p>Dr Hassan said the misinformed post came from a chiropractor in America, who claimed having co-morbidity on a death certificate meant the deaths could not be attributed to coronavirus.</p>

<p>The Melbourne mother said the death certificates had not been properly completed and falsely using data from the Centre for Disease and Control was dangerous.</p>

<p>'Such outrageous, ignorant and patently false claims are now spreading through social media by bored conspiracy theorists with a serious case of 'Stuckhome Syndrome',' she said. </p>

<p>It is well known that those with pre-existing health issues are more susceptible to coronavirus than others, with 67 per cent of Australia's coronavirus fatalities having one or more underlying co-morbidity.</p>

<p>Dr Hassan said the post highlighted a horrific figure while trying to provide deceptive information on COVID-19.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dr Hassan's post (pictured) outlined that spreading misinformation was not helpful and highly dangerous</p>

<p>'Instead of downplaying the seriousness of COVID, which is their sinister aim, the fact that six per cent of COVID victims had absolutely no underlying pre-existing condition is terrifying,' her post reads.</p>

<p>'They were relatively healthy individuals and they STILL succumbed to this wildly infectious and unpredictable disease.'</p>

<p>Dr Hassan's post received a wealth of supportive comments from her followers.</p>

<p>'Please keep up the truth telling even if some don't like it,' one comment reads.</p>

<p>'I am so grateful for your information,' another post reads. 'It makes me feel more confident in my decisions through this pandemic.'</p>
