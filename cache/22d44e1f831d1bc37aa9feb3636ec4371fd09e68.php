<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Metro Bank has joined the fight for current account switchers, revealing a refer a friend scheme which could see existing customers earn up to £250.</p>

<p>Existing customers of the bank and up to five friends can each earn £50 if they open an account and swap provider through the Current Account Switch Service.</p>

<p>In order to be paid the bonus, the newcomer must not already have an account with Metro Bank and pay in £500 in each of the first two months since opening one, make 10 debit card purchases and register for online and mobile banking.</p>

<p>Metro Bank has launched a refer a friend bonus which could see existing customers net up to £250 if they persuade five people to open an account</p>

<p>The offer, which runs until 11 December 2020, is the second switching deal announced this month, after the current account competition all but vanished due to the coronavirus.</p>

<p>Halifax announced at the start of August it would pay £100 to those who switch to its Reward and Ultimate Reward accounts by 15 September, although the deal has yet to revitalise the switching battle or tempt other giants like HSBC and NatWest, which frequently offer cash bribes to new customers, into relaunching offers.</p>

<p>The only other offer is from TSB, which will pay those who sign up to its Classic Plus account £50 if they do so through the cashback site Quidco.</p>

<p>Nationwide Building Society, one of the biggest winners in the battle for bank accounts over the last few years, paused a similar refer a friend bonus when the coronavirus pandemic hit the UK.</p>

<p>The move from Metro Bank, which turned 10 years-old at the end of last month, further highlights a change of approach under new chief executive Dan Frumkin, with the bank focusing on growing deposits through current account customers rather than through fixed-rate savings accounts.</p>

<p>It has 2.1million personal and business customers, but while customers can switch to it through CASS the bank has never disclosed how well it is doing in the switching stakes, although it has not had a high-profile switch offer in recent years aimed at attracting customers.</p>

<p>However, fellow challenger banks Monzo and Starling have been among the most successful when it comes to gaining current accounts through the switch service despite not offering money to newcomers, having collectively picked up nearly 150,000 net accounts since the start of 2018.</p>

<p>The two digital banks also pushed Metro Bank into fourth place in the latest current account rankings published earlier this month by the Competition and Markets Authority, although 81 per cent of customers surveyed still said they'd recommend it to their friends and family.</p>

<p>It also ranks third for mobile and online banking after the two smartphone banks, and number one for in-branch service.</p>

<p>Customers who wish to refer the bank to their friends in return for the £50 must register for the offer online, after which they will be given an invitation code to share.</p>

<p>Santander's 123 Lite Account will pay  up to 3% cashback  on household bills. There is a £1 monthly fee and you must log in to mobile or online banking regularly, deposit £500 per month and hold two direct debits to qualify.</p>

<p>NatWest's Reward Account pays out £5 a month in rewards if you pay out two direct debits a month of £2 each and log into mobile banking. The account comes with a £2 monthly fee and you must pay in £1,250 a month.</p>

<p>Club Lloyds's Current Account  offers benefits such as cinema tickets, magazine subscriptions and dining cards to current account holders. There is no cost if you pay £1,500 each month, otherwise a £3 fee applies. Must hold two direct debits to earn monthly credit interest.</p>

<p>TSB's Classic Plus Account pays 1.5 per cent interest on balances of up to £1,500. You must pay out two direct debits, register for internet banking and go paperless.</p>

<p>Nationwide's FlexDirect account comes with 2% interest on up to £1,500 - the highest interest rate on any current account - if you pay in at least £1,000 each month, plus a fee-free overdraft. Both perks last for a year.</p>
