<p>Katie first shared a pair of snaps alongside her mum from a recent holiday together, with the pair embracing in front of stunning beach views.  </p>

<p>She wrote: 'There are no words to express the love that my brother, sister <?php echo e('@'); ?>sophie_pricey and I have for our mum. As you know, this is something that's very close to my heart because my mum suffers from this condition. </p>

<p>'This week is IPF week. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a lung condition that scars your lungs and reduces the efficiency of your breathing. </p>

<p>'Approximately 6500 people are diagnosed with IPF every year. The <?php echo e('@'); ?>britishlungfoundation is asking for your support to help fund vital research and offer those with IPF hope for the future. See my latest story post for the link.'</p>

<p>Health: Amy was diagnosed with lung condition idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in 2017, a condition which impacts her breathing and causes scarring on the lungs</p>

<p>Last month, Katie called her mum 'my rock' after a string of devastating events including the death of her puppy, Rolo, and breaking both feet in a freak accident while on holiday in Turkey.</p>

<p>Amy has been helping Katie to keep a positive mindset after she was left unable to walk for up to two years after jumping off a wall. </p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Katie's mum has been amazing since the accident - a total superstar. </p>

<p>'As well as supporting her with many of the jobs she has had to do at home, Amy has been an emotional rock. She has insisted to Katie that this is just a blip and she will get over it. </p>

<p>'It has helped keep Katie in a really positive mindset at what is naturally a really, really tough time for her and given her a massive boost.' </p>

<p>A spokesperson for Katie told MailOnline: 'Katie's family, friends and supporters are keeping Katie focused and in good spirits - her own fun sense of humour is certainly keeping her spirits up.' </p>

<p>Katie also shared a lovely photo of her mother on Instagram and wrote: 'How gorgeous does my mum look here in a picture taken today! </p>

<p>'Love my mum so much, she is my actual total rock!'  </p>

<p>When Amy was first diagnosed, she was given a three to five year life expectancy by doctors.  </p>

<p>'I couldn't cope and when you hear 'terminal' you think she's not gone long left,' Katie said last year on Loose Women. </p>

<p>Speaking about how IPF, a rare condition that causes progressive and irreversible scarring of the lungs, has progressed, Amy said during the same interview: 'I'm not too bad. </p>

<p>'I went for tests this week with the transplant team, they keep an eye on me, my lung function tests have dropped a little bit but that's to be expected with what I have got because it is a progressive illness. </p>

<p>'But they do all the tests on the other organs in your body to prepare you for when they think you need a transplant - I'm not yet [on the transplant list] - and what they do is that they look at everything to make sure you can cope with it - your heart, liver and your kidneys and all that - and they are still 100 percent, they are fine.</p>

<p>'So at the moment they go, 'You are to healthy, go and enjoy yourself. And come back in six months.'' </p>
