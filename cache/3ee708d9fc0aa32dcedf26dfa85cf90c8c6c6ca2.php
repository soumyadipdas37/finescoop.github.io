<p>Australia's beloved Gelato Messina has released a new range of take-home toppings for customers to add onto their favourite ice cream or gelato</p>

<p>The selection features three different flavours, including choc hazelnut, caramel and peanut butter</p>

<p>The chocolate hazelnut flavour is made from a rich blend of roasted Piedmont hazelnuts and cocoa, while the dulce de leche, which is Spanish for caramel, is made using a traditional South American milk jam.</p>

<p>The peanut butter flavour is ideal for peanut addicts, but is currently sold out.</p>

<p>The toppings are available across all Gelato Messina store locations.</p>

<p>Each 350-gram bottle contains 17.5 servings and is priced at $12, or $30 for the trio</p>

<p>Not only can the toppings be added to ice cream, but they can also be used to make delicious milkshakes - which will be sure to please on warm days</p>

<p>In the Sydney suburb of Rosebury, the tasty gelato toppings are made from scratch using the finest ingredients.</p>

<p>Not only can the toppings be added to ice cream, but they can also be used to make delicious milkshakes - which will be sure to please customers on warm days.</p>

<p>Messina recommends making the milkshakes by blending 30mL of the topping with 250mL of milk until perfectly smooth and combined.</p>

<p>As the toppings are made from rich ingredients, they might be quite thick but Messina recommends microwaving the blend for 40 seconds to soften it</p>
