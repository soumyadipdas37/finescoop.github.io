<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Uber Eats has defended its 30 per cent commission charged to restaurants that use the platform, even as many hospitality businesses face financial oblivion during the coronavirus lockdowns.</p>

<p>Australia's hospitality industry was brought to its knees by nationwide COVID-19 restrictions introduced in March this year, with about 70 per cent of businesses forced to cut staff or close their doors entirely.</p>

<p>While the food delivery giant eased its rates from 35 per cent to 30 per cent in May to ease financial strains, Uber community operations director for Australia, New Zealand and North Asia Mark Capps said it was not prepared to go any lower despite the home delivery business booming.</p>

<p>He said it was services like Uber Eats that allowed restaurants to remain viable, as in-house dining had been severely restricted for over six months.</p>

<p>'We're always working with restaurants in partnership to make sure that the money we take from them we're using to invest in making that business successful,' he said, at a forum on Tuesday for the Australian Financial Review.</p>

<p>'We use the money from the service fee … to help support reliable delivery and to make sure we have safe and reliable delivery available for all our food.'</p>

<p>An Uber Eats spokesman told Daily Mail Australia that restaurants have options to lower the amount of commission they pay on each order.</p>

<p>Venues that use the pick-up only option, eliminating the need for a driver and a car, will only hand 13 per cent of each order to the company.</p>

<p>'If consumers want food delivered to their door, restaurants can divert their own staff to complete deliveries ordered on the app for a 16 per cent service fee,' he said. </p>

<p>The spokesman also explained the commission is used by Uber Eats to cover insurance costs for drivers and cyclists, advertise on behalf of local businesses and to provide ongoing customer service to restaurants and customers. </p>

<p>While Uber Eats had thrived during the lockdowns, the Uber ride-sharing business had suffered significantly, losing about 70 per cent of its trade as nightlife died away during the pandemic and many people worked from home.</p>

<p>'Research shows that prior to COVID, food delivery apps accounted for only five per cent or six per cent of a restaurant's trade,' he said, and that had since gone to 100 per cent in jurisdictions where in-house dining was not viable.</p>

<p>The bike service saw a drop of 50 per cent on March 20 when Melburnians using the Rides app received a notification requesting that they socially distance.  </p>
