<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ryanair is braced for a pay rebellion this week over a €458,000 (£424,000) bonus for chief executive Michael O'Leary. </p>

<p>Shareholder advisory group ISS said it was 'difficult to justify' the payout because Ryanair has used taxpayers' money to furlough staff and has accessed a £600million loan from the Bank of England. </p>

<p>O'Leary's cash bonus was around 92 per cent of the maximum he could have received and took his total remuneration for the year to March to €3.5million – including €2.5million under a long-term incentive plan. </p>

<p>'Difficult to justify': Michael O'Leary's cash bonus was around 92 per cent of the maximum he could have received</p>

<p>His basic salary was halved to €250,000 from April, but ISS said the pay cut was 'expected practice' for companies receiving taxpayer support. </p>

<p>It said there had been 'ample opportunity' to reduce O'Leary's bonus 'in light of the obvious looming challenges facing the company'. </p>

<p>Ryanair made a €185million loss for the three months to June. Pilots and cabin crew have reduced the 3,000 job losses initially threatened by accepting pay cuts of up to 20 per cent. </p>

<p>ISS is advising investors to vote against the non-binding pay report at Thursday's annual shareholder meeting. </p>

<p>It said: 'Given the current state of upheaval in the industry and the uncertain outlook, it is difficult to justify a payment equal to around 92 per cent of maximum opportunity to the chief executive, regardless of performance.' </p>

<p>Last year, almost 50 per cent of Ryanair shareholders voted against the pay report. </p>
