<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australians are paying millions of dollars to support 'political' artists including a climate activist who wraps wool around trees.</p>

<p>The 2020 Resilience Fund has handed out $7.6million of taxpayer cash to help artists struggling to pay their bills during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>But critics say a large chunk of the cash has been handed to artists 'obsessed with identity politics' and the grants are not in the national interest. </p>

<p>Casey Jenkins (pictured) is being supported with taxpayer cash. Her previous work (pictured) includes knitting from a yarn placed in her vagina for 28 days</p>

<p>Casey Jenkins, from Melbourne, is being supported for a project that involves her performing monthly live self-inseminations.</p>

<p>She claims the project, titled Immaculate, 'elevates the experience of queer reproduction and disrupt heteronormative parenting narratives'.</p>

<p>It is backed by art group Vitalstatistix Incorporated which was given a $20,000 grant, reported the Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>Ms Jenkins' previous work includes knitting from a yarn placed in her vagina for 28 days.</p>

<p>Other artists who have been supported include climate activist Kelly Leonard who 'weaves props for the environment' and places them near coal mines.</p>

<p>On her website she says: 'A deep empathy for landscapes at risk from the impact of coal-mining and global warming informs my work.' </p>

<p>Leonard was given a $10,000 grant along with artist Sarah Norman, who identifies as a 'non-binary transmasculine person and a diasporic Koori of Wiradjuri descent'.</p>

<p>Norman's previous work includes being cut on the back 147 times in front of an audience.</p>

<p>Julie Vulcan, whose works include an installation featuring her own blood on pieces of cotton, was also handed $10,000.</p>

<p>The Australia Council for the Arts, a government body, decides who gets funding.</p>

<p>Dr Bella d'Abrera of free-market think tank the Institute of Public Affairs said the money was being 'dished out to fund an identity politics ­obsession.'</p>

<p>Other artists who have been supported include climate activist Kelly Leonard who 'weaves props for the environment' (pictured) and places them near coal mines</p>

<p>She told Daily Mail Australia: 'Thousands of Australians are losing their entire livelihoods, yet we are paying for artists to literally send things into outer space. This has to cease immediately.</p>

<p>'It's astounding that the Australia Council for the Arts is spending taxpayers' money an array of potential artistic projects which will be of absolutely no benefit to mainstream Australians. </p>

<p>'Artists should be able to make all the political statements they wish, in whatever mediums they choose. But Australian taxpayers should not be picking up the tab.'  </p>

<p>A spokesman for the Australia Council said artists who are get the grants are required to 'fulfill obligations of accountability to the Australian Government'.</p>

<p>'We cannot share individual acquittals for privacy and commercial in confidence reasons,' the spokesman said.</p>
