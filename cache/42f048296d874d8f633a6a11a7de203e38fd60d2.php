<p>Sea-Watch 4 has some 350 migrants on board after 150 other passengers on that ship were transferred from Banksy's rescue boat late Saturday and had been looking for a port of disembarkation. </p>

<p>Sea-Watch 4, which had rescued 201 migrants before and was itself in search of a host port, decided to help the Louise Michel 'in the face of the lack of reaction' from the authorities, a spokesman for the German NGO Sea-Watch, which charters the boat with Doctors Without Borders (MSF), told AFP. </p>

<p>Earlier on Saturday, Italian coastguards had reached the Louise Michel – stranded in waters between Malta and the island of Lampedusa – but were only able to rescue 49 of the most vulnerable passenger, including 13 children. </p>

<p>The German-flagged Louise Michel had said it needed aid at the weekend after helping a boat carrying at least one dead migrant in the sea that divides Africa and Europe.</p>

<p>Its crew said the 101-foot ship had become overcrowded and unable to move, warning that some of the migrants had fuel burns and had been at sea for days. </p>

<p>The former French navy vessel, named after a female anarchist, had been almost double its maximum safe capacity of 120 and was said to be 'losing its balance'.</p>

<p>In an earlier tweet its crew had asked for urgent help, posting: 'We repeat, #LouiseMichel is unable to safely move and nobody is coming to our aid.</p>

<p>'The people rescued have experienced extreme trauma, it's time for them to be brought to a #PlaceOfSafety. We need immediate assistance.'</p>

<p>Migration activists criticised Banksy for launching a rescue ship in the Mediterranean, saying it would only encourage people smugglers to put more migrants on small boats and send them towards Europe.</p>

<p>The boat features some of Banksy's trademark work, including a girl in a life vest holding a heartshaped safety buoy.</p>

<p>Banksy, who keeps his identity a secret, explained in an online video that he had bought the boat to help migrants 'because EU authorities deliberately ignore distress calls from non-Europeans'.</p>

<p>Thousands of people are thought to have died making the dangerous trip across the Mediterranean to flee conflict, repression and poverty in Africa and the Middle East.</p>

<p>According to the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, attempts by migrant boats to cross the Mediterranean into Europe have increased this year, up 91 percent from January to July over last year's figures, to more than 14,000 people.</p>
