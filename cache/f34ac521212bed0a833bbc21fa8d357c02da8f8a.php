<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jennifer Lopez loves to put on a flashy gown to show off her hourglass figure.</p>

<p>But on Monday night the 51-year-old World Of Dance star took a much more casual turn as she dared to wear a triple denim ensemble. Her fiance, 45-year-old Alex Rodriguez, was much more dressed up in a light gray suit and a crisp white shirt.</p>

<p>It is very seldom that the two don't look in step while on the town.</p>

<p>Blue jean baby: Jennifer Lopez took a much more casual turn as she dared to wear a denim ensemble. Her fiance, 45-year-old Alex Rodriguez, was much more dressed up in a light gray suit and a crisp white shirt</p>

<p>The lookers were seen exiting the popular Carbone Restaurant in Manhattan.</p>

<p>Jennifer's look could not be missed as she modeled a denim jacket over a denim bustier. Her jeans were ripped in the knees, looking on trend.</p>

<p>And oddly the World Of Dance star's strappy shoes also looked to be denim as did her structure handbag from Coach, a brand she represents.</p>

<p>The only thing that was not denim was her face mask, which appeared to be black cotton with rhinestone studs.</p>

<p>Blue feel: Jennifer's look was a bit Nineties as she modeled a denim jacket over a denim bustier. Her jeans were ripped in the knees, looking on trend</p>

<p>Coach girl: And oddly the World Of Dance star's strappy shoes also looked to be denim as did her structure handbag from Coach, a brand she models for</p>

<p>The Bronx born babe had her highlighted hair pulled back and she had on pretty eye makeup, adding diamond stud earrings.</p>

<p>Her fingernails and toes were painted black. </p>

<p>A-Rod was much more dressed up in a snazzy light grey suit and white shirt with no tie and a pair of black boots.</p>

<p>Matchy matchy earlier this year: They were both in black for the 26th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards in January in Los Angeles</p>

<p>This sighting comes after the bombshell was seen with Alex and their combined four kids.</p>

<p>Jennifer has twins Max and Emme, aged 12, with her ex-husband, crooner Marc Anthony. Jennifer and Marc were married from 2004 until 2014.</p>

<p>Alex has two children with his ex Cynthia Scurtis - they are Natasha, aged 15, and Ella, aged 12. Alex and Cynthia were wed from 2002 until 2008. </p>

<p>Good wishes: This sighting comes after the bombshell was seen with Alex and their combined four kids. 'Wishing everyone Peace and Love ❤️ Happy Labor Day!' said Lopez to her 131M followers</p>

<p>'Tree cheers!' began the former baseball star.</p>
