<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Wolves have completed the signing of Barcelona right-back Nelson Semedo for a club-record fee that could rise to £37million. </p>

<p>The Premier League club announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning that the defender has left the Nou Camp for Molineux, posting a video of the 26-year-old taking in the stadium for the first time. </p>

<p>He is the eighth client of super-agent Jorge Mendes to arrive at Molineux, while he brings the number of Portuguese stars in Nuno Espirito Santo's squad back up to 10 following the sale of Diogo Jota to Liverpool. </p>

<p>Wolves have completed the signing of Nelson Semedo from Barcelona for a fee up to £37m </p>

<p>The 26-year-old is the fifth signing of the summer, and takes the club's spending up to £84m</p>

<p>Speaking to the club's official website after the move was completed, Semedo said: 'I chose Wolves because it’s a very good team that plays very good football. Last year they did a very good season and it’s a very important team in England, in also Europe. I hope this year we can do very good things.</p>

<p>'Coach Nuno is a very good coach. He did very good things here in Wolves, and in other teams too. For sure I’m going to learn a lot from him.</p>

<p>'The team did very good things the last three years. I’m ambitious and I hope this year we can do very good things, reach the top six and, if it’s possible, do something special.</p>

<p>'I’m very happy to be here. I’m excited to get started and thank you very much for your support and we’re going to enjoy it together.'</p>

<p>The move takes Wolves' summer spending to the £84m mark, after the arrivals of Fabio Silva, Fernando Marcal and Ki-Jana Hoever. The 20-year-old midfielder Vitinha has also joined on a season-long loan. </p>

<p> The right-back made 124 appearances for the Spanish side after joining them back in 2017</p>

<p>The move frees up cash for Barcelona, as Ronald Koeman looks to reshape his squad following a summer of big-name exits.</p>

<p>Semedo joins Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal and Luis Suarez in heading for the Nou Camp exit, and Koeman is looking to his native Holland to bring in fresh blood. </p>

<p>The former Everton and Southampton boss is now expected to turn his attentions to Ajax defender Sergino Dest. </p>

<p>Another of Mendes's clients, the 19-year-old is high on Koeman's wishlist and reports in Spain suggest the money garnered from the sale of Semedo will be used immediately to recruit his replacement.  </p>

<p>Barcelona are expected to use money from the Semedo sale to fund a move for Sergino Dest </p>
