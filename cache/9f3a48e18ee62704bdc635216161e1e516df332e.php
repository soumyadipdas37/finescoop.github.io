<p>Stunning: The former TOWIE star ensured all eyes were on her as she donned a white blazer with a plunging neckline that displayed her ample assets</p>

<p>It comes after the beautician enjoyed another fun night out in Manchester for her birthday on Thursday evening.</p>

<p>The reality star shared several updates to her Instagram where she sipped Champagne with her friends and even downed shots at Menagerie Restaurant and Bar.</p>

<p>Lauren has been in Manchester to brush up on her beautician skills at training centre Cosmetic Couture Clinic.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, the star revealed in New! magazine that she hasn't spoke to her family or parents since finding fame.</p>

<p>Party: Lauren styled her brunette locks into an updo towards the end of the evening as she departed the venue with a group of pals</p>

<p>She explained: 'No, I don't talk to any of them and they don't talk to me. They're good people, I'm not going to s**g them off. I just can't have that in my life.</p>

<p>'I feel very hurt, upset and used at times. It's such a shame since coming into the public eye how much my relationships have changed with my family. It's quite upsetting, but I have to look after me.</p>

<p>'They probably think, "If we invite Lauren she won't turn up," so they create a problem because I feel rejected when they don't invite me. I feel like they set me up to fail so they can all go, "Told ya".'</p>

<p>The TV star claimed her mother Cheryl 'rejected' her as a child and she lived with her father, who started his 'own life', from the age of four.</p>

<p>Looking good: The beauty shared a snap from the party to her Instagram and wrote: 'Making memories <?php echo e('@'); ?>jinbolaw_skybar my birthday with my best lot friends are family'</p>
