<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Darren Fletcher has urged Manchester United to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer the required funds in the transfer market, before claiming the club need to bring in 'three to five players' before the October 5 deadline.  </p>

<p>United's transfer dreams certainly haven't gone to plan this summer as they continue to stumble in their pursuit of England star Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund.</p>

<p>United's priority target all summer has been Sancho but they have yet to stump up Dortmund's remarkable £108million asking price, and the Red Devils have so far only signed Donny van de Beek in a £40million deal from Ajax.</p>

<p>Manchester United have been urged to back Ole Gunnar Solskjaer before the window shuts</p>

<p>Former United midfielder Darren Fletcher insists the club need to sign 'three to five players'</p>

<p>And former United player Fletcher insists that Solskjaer deserves the board's full backing in the transfer market as they desperately look to close the gap on Liverpool and Manchester City after what has been a frustrating summer.</p>

<p>'The job Ole has done since he came in to the team now, he deserves the players he wants,' Fletcher told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'He needs to do it for himself because he will be judged at the end of the season on results. They need three to five players. The board need to back him and get him some help.'</p>

<p>Fletcher's comments came after Solskjaer himself remained tight-lipped regarding the club's late transfer plans following the 3-0 victory over Brighton in the Carabao Cup thanks to goals from Scott McTominay, Juan Mata and Paul Pogba. </p>

<p>United have gone all out for Jadon Sancho but Borussia Dortmund are holding firm</p>

<p>When asked about United's transfer activity, Solskjaer replied: 'I can't give you any news now. We are working with the squad we've got. If there are any updates, we will give them.'</p>

<p>Then when specifically quizzed on the club's pursuit of Sancho, Solskjaer added: 'I don't comment on any other teams players.</p>

<p>'I can't concern myself about other clubs, I have to concern myself on what we're doing. The club have worked well, and are working hard to have as strong a squad as possible. And there are situations we can't control.'  </p>

<p>United are set for an extremely busy end to the transfer window, which closes on October 5.</p>

<p>The Old Trafford outfit, who still have their heart set on Sancho, have also been linked with the likes of Edinson Cavani, Luka Jovic, Ousmane Dembele and Alex Telles. </p>

<p>United sealed their progression to the Carabao Cup quarter-finals after beating Brighton 3-0</p>
