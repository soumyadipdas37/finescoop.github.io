<p>In a speech in Newcastle today, the prime minister said successfully fighting the virus means protecting jobs.</p>

<p>'During this pandemic we continue to do better than almost every other developed country in the world when it comes to protecting lives and livelihoods,' he said.</p>

<p>'But as long as we are closed, we cannot claim success, as a country. If we are shut, we are not living alongside the virus, the virus is actually keeping us from living. </p>

<p>'So as we emerge from this second wave in Victoria, and I had a good message from the Victorian Premier this morning, let's now seize the opportunity ahead of us to safely and successfully reopen this country, reconnect this country, and stay open.' </p>
