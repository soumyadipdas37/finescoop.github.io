<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A transgender woman who gave a teenage runaway drugs has argued she should avoid jail because she'll vulnerable in custody due to her gender identity.</p>

<p>Susan Willan, 61, formerly known as David Willan, on Tuesday pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates Court to supplying a drug of dependence to a child.</p>

<p>The victim, 14, collapsed three days after Willan gave her four Valium tablets at Hungry Jack's in Newcomb in March 2019, and was taken to an intensive care unit.</p>

<p>Susan Willan (pictured), 61, formerly known as David Willan, on Tuesday pleaded guilty in Geelong Magistrates Court to supplying a drug of dependence to a child </p>

<p>Prosecutor Madeleine Sargent highlighted the large age gap between the victim and pushed for a jail sentence, the Geelong Advertiser reported. </p>

<p>'Criminal offending against children should be denounced in the strongest possible terms,' Ms Sargent said. </p>

<p>But Willan's defence lawyer Thomas Edwards described the offence as a 'momentary' judgement lapse and argued for a community correction order, as his client would be at risk in jail due to being transgender.</p>

<p>The court heard the crime took place after the teenager approached Willan in the restaurant car park and asked to use her phone.</p>

<p>Willan asked the girl if she had ever taken drugs before giving her the tablets, and the pair then went to Willan's nearby home where the teen slept on a couch.</p>

<p>Blood tests taken after the girl collapsed and ended up in ICU found Valium and other substances in her system.</p>

<p>The girl said in a victim impact statement read to the court she was 'taken advantage of' and did not know she had been given Valium.</p>

<p>'I did not realise what the drugs could do to me or what they were,' she said.</p>

<p>Willan will be sentenced on September 16.</p>
