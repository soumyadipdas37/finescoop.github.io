<p>Joyce Echaquan, 37, from Manawan, died on Monday, two days after she was admitted to Joliette hospital in Quebec with stomach pains. </p>

<p>During her stay, the mother-of-seven, who was a member of the Atikamekw Indigenous tribe, used her phone to start a Facebook livestream, capturing the disparaging remarks made by hospital workers.</p>

<p>'Are you done acting stupid? Are you done?' one of the nurses says as the woman moans in pain.  </p>

<p>'You made some bad choices, my dear,' another nurse said. 'What are your children going to think, seeing you like this?' </p>

<p>'She's good at having sex, more than anything else,' the other nurse adds.  </p>

<p>Echaquan's family said the mother had a heart problem and believe she died after she was given too much morphine, according to a GoFundMe page.  </p>

<p>The videos sparked a wave of criticism and protest in a country which has a long history of abuse against its indigenous people. </p>

<p>The 37-year-old mother of seven, who was a member of the Atikamekw tribe, filmed herself being abuses by hospital nurses as she writhed in pain. Officials on Wednesday said an investigation into her death has been opened</p>

<p>Echaquan's death has drawn outrage and protests in the community amid ongoing concerns over treatment of indigenous people in Canada</p>

<p>'Like all Quebecers I was shocked by the racism she was subjected to,' Quebec Premier Francois Legault told reporters in Quebec City on Wednesday. </p>

<p>He said a provincial task force on racism would issue recommendations in the coming weeks, and a nurse had been fired over the incident. </p>

<p>'I have seven children who no longer have a mother,' Carol Dube, Echaquan's husband, told Radio-Canada on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Echaquan's death comes amid ongoing concerns over treatment of indigenous people in Canada, who make up about five per cent of Canada's nearly 37million population. </p>

<p>A 2019 Quebec government report found systemic discrimination against indigenous people accessing public services.</p>

<p>In June, a video showing a forceful arrest of a Canadian indigenous leader by Royal Canadian Mounted Police over an incident involving an expired license plate was criticized by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</p>

<p>Federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said Echaquan's death 'is not an isolated event.'</p>

<p>'Justice for Joyce' protests are planned in cities across the country in the coming days, including one in Montreal on Saturday that organizers estimate will draw over a thousand attendees.</p>

<p>'There are many indigenous people that are in the hospital that don't have a telephone to record such a situation,' said Claudette Dumont-Smith, executive director at the Native Women's Association of Canada.</p>

<p>Echaquan's family said the mother had a heart problem and believe she died after she was given too much morphine. One of the nurses has been fired over the incident</p>
