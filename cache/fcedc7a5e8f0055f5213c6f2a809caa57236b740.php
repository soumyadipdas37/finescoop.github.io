<p>The Morning Star in Williamstown, south west Melbourne, and the Mona Castle in Seddon, west Melbourne, both shut their doors for good this week. </p>

<p>Two beloved Melbourne pubs, The Morning Star Hotel (pictured) in Williamstown and the Mona Castle Hotel in Seddon, have been forced to close amid the draconian second lockdown </p>

<p>The Mona Castle (pictured) owner was forced to close the pub after not being able to pay the rent. He criticised the Victorian Government for neglecting small businesses during COVID-19</p>

<p>Mona Castle owner Gary Clough handed over the keys to the historic pub, which is more than 140-years old, on Friday after more than 15 years with the business.  </p>

<p>'We had a glimmer of hope there about two and a half months ago and then the landlord was wanting full rent,' he told 3AW. </p>

<p>Mr Clough made the tough decision to shut the venue after his landlord refused to offer a rent reduction during the pandemic. </p>

<p>'It got to the stage where we had to go into negotiations with the Small Business Commission,' the owner explained.   </p>

<p>Mr Clough criticised the Victorian Government for failing to support small businesses during lockdown.  </p>

<p>'They government don't work in small businesses, they don't understand the amount of people employed and the amount of tax we pay,' he said.   </p>

<p>Mr Clough said he would continue with his old job as an electrician and 'keep moving forward' with the support of his friends.   </p>

<p>The popular hotel announced it would not be reopening its doors in a Facebook post on Monday.  </p>

<p>'Wanted to say thank you to each and everyone of you for making the experience of living in and owning a pub an enjoyable one. </p>

<p>'It is with heavy hearts that we advise that we will not be reopening the Morning Star post this lockdown, the financial impact is simply too great. </p>

<p>'We thank the patrons, staff and local community with all of our hearts,' the statement read.  </p>
