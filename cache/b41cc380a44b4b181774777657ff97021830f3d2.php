<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Black Eyed Peas made their MTV VMAs debut by closing out this year's show with a new single and a blast from the past.</p>

<p>And it was a memorable and electrifying return for will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo, who took to the stage with glowing crotches and newest member J. Rey Soul taking over vocals for Fergie.</p>

<p>The hitmakers came into the night with two nominations of their own: Best Collaboration for their song Ritmo (Bad Boys for Life) featuring J Balvin and Best Latin for the track Mamacita with Ozuna and J. Rey Soul.</p>

<p>They're back! Black Eyed Peas closed out the 2020 MTV VMAs on Sunday with J. Rey Soul taking over vocals for Fergie</p>

<p>Fantastic four: The group seen with Fergie back in November 2010</p>

<p>The group kicked-off the performance with a rendition of Vida Loca off their latest studio album, Translation, with special guests Tyga and a sky-sized projection of Nicky Jam. </p>

<p>By the time will.i.am kicked into the first verse, all eyes were focused on the group's three leading men and their crotches, that lit up like glow sticks.</p>

<p>Shaking and grinding to the pulsating beat, will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo wore matching white outfits with denim jean jackets.</p>

<p>Group effort: Tyga joined the group to drop some lyrics on Vida Loca</p>

<p>'It's mi vida loca (it's mi vida loca) -- So cállate tu boca (yeah, cállate tu boca), the band sang in tandem with J.Rey belting out the higher notes and harmony.</p>

<p>'I already told ya, I told ya, I'm livin' -- La vida loca (la vida loca).'</p>

<p>After trading lead vocals in the closing moments of Vida Loca, the group then transitioned into an encore performance of their massive 2009 hit, I Got A Feeling. </p>

<p>In the mix: J.Rey Soul joined the group at center stage for the first chorus of Vida Loca</p>

<p>New album: Vida Loca is off the Black Eyed Peas' new studio album, Translation, which dropped June 19</p>

<p>Never one to shy away from making a profound statement, will.i.am finished up the short set with a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, who passed away on Friday, by saying: 'Wakanda Forever', which was quickly followed-up with 'Black Lives Matter.'</p>

<p>J. Rey, who gained recognition by appearing in season one of The Voice of the Philippines in 2013, joined the Black Eyed Peas in February 2018. </p>

<p>She replaced longtime member, Fergie, who had stepped back from the group to devote more time to her son Axl, now seven, whom she shares with ex-husband Josh Duhamel. </p>

<p>Translation dropped on June 19 and is the band's eighth studio album. It also features the singles No Mañana, Ritmo (Bad Boys for Life) and Mamacita.</p>
