<p>With more cleaning power than a regular mop, it's designed to clean and sanitise your hard floors using just water, and in minimal time. Shoppers have raved about the Shark steam mop, calling it 'satisfying to use', 'light and maneuverable' and 'quick and efficient'.</p>

<p>The Shark Steam Mop S1000UK is £64 on Amazon and has received impressive reviews from shoppers </p>

<p>If you're looking for an affordable steam mop but with the backing of a big household name, then you can't really go wrong with the Shark Steam Mop 1000UK. At £64, the mop is great value and equally good for common spills to larger spring cleans. </p>

<p>Best for cleaning sealed flooring, the Shark Steam Mop doesn't come with some of the bells and whistles of other mops which can also clean carpets and furniture. While it may not have multi-functional accessories, it's a top buy if you're looking to leave tiles and hard-sealed floors, including wood floor and laminate flooring, sparkling.</p>

<p>Unlike a traditional mop and bucket, this steam mop uses plain boiling water to rid grime and dirt- no need for detergents or chemicals. In fact, the Shark Steam Mop 1000UK claims to rid 99.9 per cent of bacteria with just water. </p>

<p>Another added: 'My floor is shining, clean and dry super quick. No leaking, lightweight and easy to use. I highly recommend it to everyone!' </p>

<p>What's more, the microfibre cleaning pads are reusable and machine washable, so there's no need to worry about the cost and hassle of replacing disposable wipes.</p>

<p>The swivel mop design is perfect for cleaning hard-to-reach areas like tight corners around furniture. As you have to pump to activate the steam yourself, it means you can blast more stubborn stains for more effective cleaning. </p>

<p>'Does its job phenomenally. One of the best purchases of 2020 for me. I have hard floors throughout the house so mopping is quite a regular occurrence, especially due to having pets too. </p>

<p>This handy little mop has made the world of difference in that it’s easy to use, easy to store and makes the house smell lovely. You don’t need to use anything in it aside from water but I like to add some Zoflora with the water for a perfumed smell that lasts hours after the mopping.' </p>

<p>The results are impressive, with one shopper writing: 'Well I am kind of embarrassed and horrified...but this in a way is a very good thing as it shows the quality of both the pads on this machine and the effectiveness of the machine itself.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'Cleans our tiled kitchen floors brilliantly, even gets up some of the tough dried on stains. We have two large indoor house cats and it’s absolutely fantastic for cleaning up after them as well as us! Best feature is we don’t have to use anything other than water and it still cleans amazingly.'</p>
