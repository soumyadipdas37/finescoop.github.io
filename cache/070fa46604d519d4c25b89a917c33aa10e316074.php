<p>More familiar with tailored trouser-suits than tie-dye two-pieces, Jennifer suggested her stylist was taking a post-lockdown break after venturing out in a series of surprisingly unflattering ensembles - including the latter.  </p>

<p>But it doesn't end there; chunky knitwear, shapeless slacks and a risky take on the divisive double denim look have all featured during four consecutive appearances in New York City.   </p>

<p>Unusual: Her sophisticated sense of style has won more plaudits than her music career, but Jennifer Lopez appeared to take a rare misstep this week thanks to a poor run of outfits</p>

<p>Stepping out on Monday the Latina star opted for an unflattering $38 white cleavage-boosting Naked Wardrobe 'Hourglass' bodysuit while joining her younger sister Lynda for lunch in Manhattan's West Village neighborhood.   </p>

<p>She added to the look with a pair of ill-fitting check trouser that caught the eye as they settled own for an al fresco meal.  </p>

<p>Later that day she raised eyebrows in a notably garish hooded top and matching joggers as she rented one of the city's environmentally conscious Citi Bikes.   </p>

<p>Jennifer's look could not be missed as she modeled a denim jacket over a denim bustier as the couple dined out at Manhattan's Carbone Restaurant.</p>

<p>Misfire: On Tuesday the singer and actress continued a recurring theme by wearing another questionable ensemble, this time a dowdy knit cardigan and shapeless slacks</p>

<p>The Hustlers star adopted the casual look while out in Tribeca for an early evening dinner with her fiancé, who looked dashing in a dark suit.</p>

<p>The outing came the same day that the couple renewed their push to buy the New York Mets by indicating the actress would be the controlling figure if they won, rather than her future husband.</p>
