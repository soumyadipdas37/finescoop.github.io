<p>A teenager from Scottsdale, Arizona has been arrested for allegedly raping two women, including a neighbor who lives in his apartment building.</p>

<p>DNA evidence linked the 16-year-old boy to the assaults, which happened one week apart on Oct. 18 and Oct. 24, police said.</p>

<p>The boy's name has not been released because he is a juvenile and it has not yet been determined whether he will be tried as an adult.</p>

<p>Police said the suspect entered an apartment in the Camden San Paloma apartment complex through an unlocked patio door</p>

<p>He is being held on sexual assault, kidnapping and burglary charges, and police believe he may be connected to more crimes in the area, according to a local Arizona television station, KPHO CBS 5.</p>

<p>Police were led to the suspect through a tip from the Scottsdale community, according to Sgt. Mark Clark of the Scottsdale police department.</p>

<p>The suspect's DNA was already in the police agency's database because he has a criminal past that includes crimes related to the ones he is currently being held for.</p>

<p>Authorities did not provide any further details on the boy's former crimes.</p>

<p>They said DNA testing is ongoing, as police collected additional samples from the suspect's home through a search warrant.</p>

<p>DNA samples that were on file have already been linked to both assaults.</p>

<p>The victims of the rapes could not identify the boy in a line-up of suspects, but police say there are some similarities between his appearance and a composite sketch of the suspect that was drawn with the help of the first victim's description of her attacker.Â </p>

<p>In both attacks, the assailant entered first-floor apartments through unlocked patio doors of women who live alone.</p>

<p>In the first assault, which happened at 11 p.m. on October 18, the assailant entered an apartment naked and raped the 49-year-old woman living there, who had just finished showering.</p>

<p>He later fled, still wearing no clothes. The second assault occurred at an apartment building across the street around 11:30 p.m. on October 24.</p>

<p>The victim, 29, was sitting on a couch near the door in a nightgown when the assailant broke in, police said.</p>

<p>On Thursday, the day before police arrested the teenager, authorities exonerated a 22-year-old man who was previously arrested for the same crimes.</p>

<p>Police said forensic evidence did not match DNA samples collected from the crime scene.</p>

<p>The entire community has been on watch as the investigation has been ongoing, with police urging resident to keep their doors and windows locked and their blinds drawn.</p>

<p>The suspect was described as a black male about 5-feet, 7-inches tall who has an athletic build.</p>
