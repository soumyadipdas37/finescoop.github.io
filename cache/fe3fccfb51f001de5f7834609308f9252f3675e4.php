<p>The 31-year-old revealed: 'A guy came up to me at a bar and told me I was a hard seven, but he thought with a bit of filler, my lips done and some boobs, I would be a strong 10.' </p>

<p>Before and after: Casey looks much different in recent photos (right) compared to her days in Hi-5 (left, in 2010)</p>

<p>Remember this? Casey joined Hi-Five in 2008, but left the group in 2013, she pursued a solo singing and acting career</p>

<p>'I don't understand how people feel they have a right to enter my space or anyone's space and tell them what they need to do to better themselves. You don't know what that person is going through.</p>

<p>'You don't know if they are happy with who they are. Who are you to speak to a random and tell them they need to inject their face to make their jaw smaller?'</p>
