<p>Loved-up: Love Island's Nas Majeed, 24, and Eva Zapico, 21, packed on the PDA as they went window shopping for a house in London on Tuesday</p>

<p>Documenting their outing with a slew of selfies, Nas opted for an oversized grey jumper and ripped black jeans as he headed out with girlfriend Eva.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eva displayed her eye-catching curves in a loose black t-shirt and form-fitting khaki leggings as she excitedly leapt on Nas' shoulders.</p>

<p>The couple seemed to be as in-love as ever despite months being holed up in lockdown as they perused some of the homes on offer.</p>

<p>Adorable: The builder and recruitment consultant were more loved-up than ever as they stepped out together, eight long months after meeting in the ITV2 villa</p>

<p>Hilarious: Eva left Nas struggling to stay upright as she leapt on his shoulders during their romantic outing</p>

<p>In July, Nas revealed he'd finally asked Eva to be his girlfriend, during a cosy date at Jin Bo Law in central London.</p>

<p>Confirming the news with fans on Instagram, the reality star shared a sweet snap from their romantic evening, which he captioned: 'Officially a couple #securedthebag #trustinyoursauce.' (sic)</p>

<p>An excited Eva uploaded an identical image to her social media platform, which she captioned: 'I'VE GOT A BOYFRENNNNNNNN.' (sic)</p>

<p>Say cheese! The pair documented their romance with a slew of loved-up selfies as they enjoyed a stroll in the sunshine</p>

<p>The social media influencer was kicked out of the Love Island villa ahead of the final alongside her beau when he dumped eventual runner-up Demi Jones.</p>

<p>Ahead of his exit, Nas apologised to Demi, 21, for ditching her in favour of Eva, shortly before she embarked on a romance with Luke Mabbott and finished in third place behind Luke Trotman and Siannise Fudge and Paige Turley and Finley Tapp.</p>

<p>The Londoner shared at the time: 'I know its obviously tricky the way things panned out, but I genuinely wish you all the best and I do apologise for probably the way I have gone about it.'</p>

<p>Responding to his apology, style adviser Demi said: 'Obviously, I was upset with what happened, but everything happens for a reason.'</p>

<p>At last! In July, Nas revealed he'd finally asked Eva to be his girlfriend, six months after they'd first met in the Love Island villa</p>

<p>The pair shared they were exclusively dating and had met each other's parents just weeks after leaving the series.</p>

<p>Speaking to BBC Radio 1's The Reality Tea podcast in March, Nas said: 'We're exclusively dating.</p>

<p>'She's met my parents... She met my family and the first thing she said was: "Oh, hello, auntie."</p>

<p>'And obviously, to us, to me that was a massive, a massive thing. My family said: "She's so respectful. she's so lovely."'</p>

<p>Nobody but her! The pair previously shared they were exclusively dating and had met each other's parents just weeks after leaving the series</p>
