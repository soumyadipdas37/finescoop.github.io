<p>Is that you KoKo? Khloe Kardashian has been posting photos to social media that don't quite look like the curvy Keeping Up With Kardashians star</p>

<p>Bigger eyes for sure: And on Thursday the Revenge Body host posted yet another snap to Instagram where she was almost unrecognizable while modeling darker hair and a more slender face</p>

<p>In the new image shared on Thursday, Khloe has her brunette hair pulled back with a wavy ponytail down her back and beige makeup perfectly blended to look dewy.</p>

<p>It is either the angle she was photographed at or a good case of Photoshop, but her face looks very different.</p>

<p>The girlfriend of Tristan Thompson seems to have bigger eyes, higher cheekbones, a more slender nose and a pointier chin. </p>

<p>Something has changed? In the new image shared on Thursday, Khloe has her brunette hair pulled back with a wavy ponytail down her back and beige makeup perfectly blended to look dewy</p>

<p>A new face? It is either the angle she was photographed at or a good case of Photoshop, but her face looks very different. The girlfriend of Tristan Thompson seems to have bigger eyes, higher cheekbones, a more slender nose and a pointier chin</p>

<p>Another woman? She looked very different as she sucked on her straw as well</p>

<p>Khloe is smiling as she wears a sheer black top and white print leggings from her brand Good American with a black background as well as black sneakers.</p>

<p>She is holding a water bottle as she says, 'My rhinestone cup makes water taste better btw, Kourt is jealous of my cup outfit: <?php echo e('@'); ?>goodamerican.'</p>

<p>The star could be mistaken for model and actress Olivia Culpo. </p>

<p>Fans were quick to react with courtneyguenther saying, 'I thought this was Kourtney at first glance ☺️.'</p>

<p>Not having it: Babypana23 offered this direct comment: 'You've completely changed,' adding a teared-eye emoji. And Prissysha West then said: 'You look totally different' with a wide-eyed blushing emoji</p>

<p>More shocked fans: Itsdouaa8 then said, 'I didn't recognise her' and shared a hand-on-face emoji then Jessielu1210 said: What did you do to your face?? You look so different'</p>

<p>The day before the star told People that she thrives on changing her appearance.</p>

<p>'I never like to stick with one look for too long. Short hair, major glam, bright lips - you name a look, I've tried it.</p>

<p>Busted: The 36-year-old mother-of-one did it in May where she used so many filters and Photoshop tricks that she was mistaken for Chrishell Stause or Kaitlyn Bristowe, causing fans to cry 'filter!'</p>

<p>'You get to be a different character every single day and experiment. To me, beauty should be anything but boring. It's a form of self-expression. There's really no right or wrong, it's more about how it makes you feel.'</p>

<p>The 36-year-old reality television star is back to brunette now after a stint as a blonde and she is having 'a lot of fun' with her new look.</p>

<p>She shared: 'I'm having a lot of fun as a 'new' brunette.</p>

<p>'I love to change things up whenever I'm getting too comfortable with a look. It's whatever makes you feel more playful and daring.'</p>

<p>Change is good: The day before the star told People that she thrives on changing her appearance. 'I never like to stick with one look for too long. Short hair, major glam, bright lips - you name a look, I've tried it.</p>

<p>In May sources insisted that Khloe is not concerned with the backlash over her changing looks. </p>

<p>An insider told UsWeekly: 'Khloe doesn't care about the backlash she's been getting from fans saying she doesn't look like herself in her recent photos.'</p>

<p>'She thinks she looks great,' the insider adds. 'And actually [she] does not care what people think as long as she's happy.'</p>

<p>Who's that girl? When Khloe's career began she had a very different face; seen in 2007</p>

<p>She's certainly having a sense of humour about it at least, after clapping back to fans who have questioned her new look.</p>

<p>'Why do you look so different in all your photos?' one fan asked recently, with Khloe hitting back: 'My weekly face transplant clearly.'</p>

<p>The May picture became popular for Instagram meme accounts, that have compared the photos of Khloe to older pictures, where it clearly looks like a completely different person. </p>

<p>Actually, all the ladies have changed: Here she is with sisters Kim and Kourtney in 2008, left, and this summer, right, for their fragrance ad</p>

<p>And the backlash intensified in July when she was seen in the exact same outfit on her show KUWTK.</p>

<p>She looked very different, as if her makeup and hair had been underdone compared with the Instagram photo. </p>

<p>Also in July Khloe was slammed for looking like a different person when she modeled for Scott Disick's line Untalented. </p>
