<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A retired sergeant from the Los Angeles Police Department sparked outrage on social media when she told MSNBC on Wednesday that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron, who is black, is ‘skinfolk but he is not kinfolk.’</p>

<p>Cheryl Dorsey spoke to MSNBC shortly after Cameron, a conservative Republican and the first black man ever elected attorney general in Kentucky, announced that a Louisville grand jury would not indict any of the three police officers directly for the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor.</p>

<p>‘Let me say this as a black woman,’ Dorsey told MSNBC.</p>

<p>is there a Black conservative that doesn't get these types of comments, or worse, said about them?</p>

<p>Daniel Cameron (left), the first black man ever elected attorney general in Kentucky, was denounced by retired LAPD Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey (right) as 'skinfolk but not kinfolk'</p>

<p>Cameron, a Republican, has come under fire after he announced on Wednesday that none of the three police officers involved in the fatal March 13 shooting of Breonna Taylor (above) would be directly charged</p>

<p>‘He does not speak for black folks. He's skinfolk but not he is not kinfolk.</p>

<p>‘He does not speak for all of us. This was not a tragedy, this was a murder.</p>

<p>‘He should be ashamed of himself.’</p>

<p>The remark drew condemnation on Twitter, with some comparing it to the ‘Uncle Tom’ slur.</p>

<p>‘I guess the world isn’t used to this saying,’ Tia Ewing tweeted.</p>

<p>‘Black people have been saying this amongst one another forever.</p>

<p>‘Remember Uncle Tom, that’s where the ideology comes from.’</p>

<p>Radio host Mark Levin tweeted: ‘MSNBC promotes race-baiting guest attacking black Kentucky AG.’</p>

<p>Bill Iannacci tweeted: ‘Shameful statement and not acceptable.</p>

<p>Bill Iannacci tweeted: ‘Shameful statement and not acceptable.'</p>

<p>‘Anyone who watched that full press conference could see how emotional and difficult it was for the AG.</p>

<p>‘He spoke facts while also having the compassion and concern deserved for Breonna Taylor.’</p>

<p>Another Twitter user commented: ‘This guy (Cameron) is really impressive.</p>

<p>Fired Louisville detective Brett Hankison (above in his mugshot) was charged with three counts of wanton endangerment in connection to the police raid on the night of March 13</p>

<p>‘So to the left because he’s not on their team that means he has to be destroyed immediately.’</p>

<p>‘Have you let Mr. Biden know he has to say "If you ain't votin' for me, then you ain't kinfolk, just skinfolk"?’</p>

<p>Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee for president, sparked controversy in May when he told a radio host that ‘you ain’t black’ if you are undecided on who to vote for in November.</p>

<p>Prosecutors said two officers who fired their weapons at Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman, were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend.</p>

<p>The only charges were three counts of wanton endangerment against fired Officer Brett Hankison for shooting into a home next to Taylor’s with people inside.</p>

<p>Taylor, an emergency medical worker, was shot multiple times by white officers who entered her home during a narcotics investigation in the early morning hours of March 13.</p>

<p>The decision not to indict the officers for murder sparked massive protests nationwide. Demonstrators are seen above marching in Detroit on Wednesday</p>

<p>She was killed after police fired in response to a gunshot from her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, who discharged his weapon because he thought he was being robbed.</p>

<p>Cameron said that while the officers had a no-knock warrant, the investigation showed they announced themselves before entering.</p>

<p>The warrant used to search her home was connected to a suspect who did not live there, and no drugs were found inside.</p>

<p>Cameron’s contention that the police officers announced who they were when they knocked on the door contradicts reporting by The New York Times, which says nearly a dozen neighbors did not recall hearing the police identify themselves.</p>

<p>Governor Andy Beshear, a Democrat, urged Cameron to post online all the evidence that could be released without affecting the charges filed.</p>

<p>‘Those that are currently feeling frustration, feeling hurt, they deserve to know more,’ he said.</p>

<p>Officers Myles Cosgrove (left) and John Mattingly (right) who were present during the police raid on March 13, were not charged on Wednesday. Hankison was fired from the LMPD while the other two officers were placed on administrative assignment </p>

<p>The case exposed the wide gulf between public opinion on justice for those who kill black Americans and the laws under which those officers are charged, which regularly favor police and do not often result in steep criminal accusations.</p>

<p>At a news conference, Cameron spoke to that disconnect: ‘Criminal law is not meant to respond to every sorrow and grief.’</p>

<p>‘But my heart breaks for the loss of Miss Taylor. ... My mother, if something was to happen to me, would find it very hard,’ he added, choking up.</p>

<p>But Cameron, who is the state’s first Black attorney general, said the officers acted in self-defense after Taylor’s boyfriend fired at them.</p>

<p>He added that Hankison and the two other officers who entered Taylor’s apartment announced themselves before entering — and so did not execute the warrant as ‘no knock,’ according to the investigation. The city has since’ banned such warrants.</p>

<p>‘According to Kentucky law, the use of force by (Officers Jonathan) Mattingly and (Myles) Cosgrove was justified to protect themselves,’ Cameron said.</p>

<p>‘This justification bars us from pursuing criminal charges in Miss Breonna Taylor’s death.’ </p>
