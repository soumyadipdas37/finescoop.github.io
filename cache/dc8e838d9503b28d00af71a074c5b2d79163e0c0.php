<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gareth Southgate is set to ring the changes for Tuesday's clash against Denmark with Trent Alexander-Arnold hopeful of a start.</p>

<p>The England boss will finalise his plans for the clash in Copenhagen over the next 24 hours but right back Kyle Walker's sending off against Iceland in Reykjavik on Saturday enforces at least one change.</p>

<p>Liverpool's Alexander-Arnold, who has missed much of pre-season and was left out of the starting XI at the weekend as he builds up his fitness, is in line to take the vacated slot. Southgate views the full-back as crucial to his plans ahead of next summer's Euros.</p>

<p>Conor Coady could make his England debut against Denmark if there is a change in formation</p>

<p>The manager is planning further tweaks to his team, including a change in formation, switching to a 3-4-3 having used a 4-3-3 against Iceland.</p>

<p>The move would see Southgate draft in a central defender in place of a midfielder and that could open the door for Conor Coady, who plays in a back three with Wolves, to be handed his international debut. Everton's Michael Keane is another option.</p>

<p>Speaking after the win in Iceland, Southgate fell short of confirming that goalkeeper Jordan Pickford would keep his place, with Burnley's Nick Pope hopeful of replacing him. </p>

<p>Southgate will make late checks on the fitness of all his players — the most notable being captain Harry Kane — after many appeared to be suffering with fatigue during the closing stages in Reykjavik.</p>

<p>The England boss said: 'I think the most important thing over the next few days will be to assess who can start two games, what gives us the freshness but also keeps enough experience to keep the balance of the team right.</p>

<p>'Energy will be key. And I think you saw through the game, particularly the first 20 minutes, that match sharpness was lacking. But it is impossible to expect them to be at their best, given not only the time since their last competitive games, but also the shortage of training minutes.</p>

<p>'Until we are able to assess everybody that is still going to need some piecing together.'</p>
