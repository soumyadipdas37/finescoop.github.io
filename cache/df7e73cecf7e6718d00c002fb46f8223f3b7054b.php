<p>Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong died on April 12 this year having been admitted to Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, where she worked, suffering from a shortness of breath.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old’s partner Ernest Boateng said she was initially discharged from the hospital on April 5 before being readmitted two days later with coronavirus symptoms, at 35 weeks pregnant.</p>

<p>A pre inquest review hearing was told Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, 28, pictured, who died after undergoing an emergency caesarean to deliver and save her baby daughter, had been initially discharged from Luton and Dunstable University Hospital, where she worked</p>

<p>Surgeons safely the delivered baby, also named Mary, by caesarean section before Ms Agyapong was transferred to the intensive care unit where she died just days later on Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>It was a double blow to her family, who had also lost Ms Agyapong's father Stephen to the same disease just two weeks before.  </p>

<p>The 28-year-old, who was 35 weeks pregnant when she tested positive for Covid-19, underwent an emergency caesarean to save her daughter, also named Mary (pictured)</p>

<p>The preliminary cause of death was given as pneumonia and Covid-19. </p>

<p>A pre-inquest review at Bedfordshire and Luton Coroner's Court on Wednesday briefly outlined concerns Mr Boateng had about the decision to discharge Ms Agyapong from hospital on April 5, and the conditions at her work while she was pregnant.</p>

<p>Emma Whitting, senior coroner for Bedfordshire and Luton, told lawyers representing Ms Agyapong's family, the hospital trust, and the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch that witnesses including senior members of the discharge team and the mother of two's line manager or equivalent were likely to be required to give evidence. </p>

<p>The coroner adjourned the hearing until a further pre-inquest review in January, with the inquest continuing over three to four days in March.</p>

<p> Colleagues paid tribute to Ms Agyapong, who also went by her married name Mary Boateng, with Caitlin Green posting that she will 'live on in her beautiful baby girl'</p>

<p>Earlier, she told Mr Boateng, who watched on video link: 'I want to start by expressing my condolences for the loss of Mary.</p>

<p>'I have seen pictures of her and read a little bit about her in the press, and I can only imagine what a hole she's left in your life and the lives of your family members and her colleagues.'</p>

<p>Ms Agyapong's death followed that of 55-year-old consultant Amged El-Hawrani, who became the first frontline NHS hospital worker to die on March 28 after testing positive for coronavirus.</p>

<p>Mr Boateng previously said his wife, originally from Ghana, should not have been working at the hospital at the start of the pandemic as she had entered the third trimester.</p>

<p>Senior colleagues of Ms Agyapong at Luton and Dunstable University Hospital where she worked, will be asked to give evidence into her death following concerns from her family</p>

<p>But the hospital said it did not have any coronavirus patients before she took maternity leave.</p>

<p>David Carter, chief executive of Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, described Ms Agyapong as 'a highly valued and loved member of our team, a fantastic nurse and a great example of what we stand for in this trust'.</p>

<p>Suzanne White, representing Mr Boateng as head of clinical negligence at legal firm Leigh Day, said: 'Our client, Ernest Boateng, has lost his partner, and two small children have lost their mother.</p>

<p>'Hopefully any pressures that led to that working situation will be made clear and it will be fully understood if they had any bearing on Mary's death.'</p>

<p>A crowdfunding campaign for the couple's two children - including young son AJ - has raised almost £200,000.</p>
