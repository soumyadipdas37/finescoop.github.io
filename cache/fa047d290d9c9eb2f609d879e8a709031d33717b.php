<p>And while the 'cheating bride' has repaired her public image in the three years since her infamous stint on reality TV, she's now back in the hot seat as her season airs in the UK for the first time. </p>

<p>English viewers have taken to social media in droves to express their outrage over Davina, who memorably 'cheated' on her TV husband Ryan Gallagher with bad boy Dean Wells.</p>

<p>Backlash: Davina Rankin is receiving major backlash from English viewers as Married At First Sight Australia's fifth season airs in the UK for the first time </p>

<p>'I honestly think Davina from Married At First Sight Australia is one of the worst human beings I've seen on television,' raged one viewer.</p>

<p>'I dunno why it’s taken me so long to discover Married At First Sight, but I’ve started watching the Australian version and I really need to discuss how much of a terrible human Davina is,' wrote another.</p>

<p>'Season 5 of Married at First Sight Australia has me OUTRAGED I literally wish the experts could rip Davina a new a**ehole,' another viewer snapped.</p>

<p>One MAFS fan lost their cool, ranting: 'OMG, women like Davina make my skin crawl.</p>

<p>'Selfish, liar, all about her, not taking any responsibility for her actions, delusional, no compassion for the other person’s feelings. She thinks her looks will excuse anything.'</p>

<p>While Davina has drawn the wrath of English viewers, the Instagram model has managed to fix her image at home. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old has been in a serious relationship with partner Jaxon Manuel since the show ended, and the couple welcomed a daughter named Mila-Mae last November.</p>

<p>Davina has kept out of trouble since MAFS, while many of her former co-stars, including Tracey Jewel, have been in multiple scandals and controversies. </p>

<p>Remember this? Davina was paired with larrikin Ryan Gallagher on Married At First Sight's fifth season back in 2018</p>

<p>Drama: The Instagram model memorably had an 'affair' with Tracey Jewel's TV husband Dean Wells (pictured together)</p>

<p>She also claimed that her villainous portrayal on the show was a mixture of bad editing and producer interference. </p>

<p>'To be honest, MAFS is just a load of bullshit, it's not this pretty little fairy tale that the public thinks it is,' she said in an interview last year.</p>

<p>'It's literally just like going to work every day,' she continued. 'You wake up, you film, you pretend to like the person you're with, you do what the producers say and then it finishes and everyone has a mental breakdown. </p>

<p>Scandal: Davina has kept out of trouble since MAFS, while many of her former co-stars, including Tracey Jewel (pictured), have been in multiple scandals and controversies</p>

<p>'No one actually liked who they were paired with, I was just the only one to openly say it! Meanwhile, everyone else was saying it behind closed doors!'  </p>

<p>Despite being depicted as manipulative cheaters on screen, both Davina and Dean Wells have claimed that Ryan Gallagher gave them permission off camera to pursue each other on the show.</p>

<p>They have also alleged Ryan was secretly trying to hook up with Troy Delmege's 'bride' Ashley Irvin behind the scenes, but this wasn't aired on TV.</p>
