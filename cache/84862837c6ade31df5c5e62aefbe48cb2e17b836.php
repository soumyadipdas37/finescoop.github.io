<p>Hungarian children's illustrator Gergely Dudás, better known as Dudolf, challenged players to find the seven things separating these two almost identical beach scenes</p>

<p>The puzzle, shared on Dudolf's Facebook and website, proved popular with his fans, who agreed it was 'seriously difficult' but 'fun'. </p>

<p>One posted: 'Found five! Then I needed the solution'. Another wrote: 'Couldn't find the last one, but finally did.' A third asked: 'Did everyone have as much difficulty as I did?' </p>

<p>If you're struggling to find them then here's a clue: the differences may be as small as a change in logo or a detail on an item of clothing.</p>

<p>Still having a hard time? You'll find the solutions below. </p>

<p>Answers: The logo on the suncream, the fruit on the ground, the direction of the seashell swirl, the watermelon seeds, the band on a sunhat, the colours on an ice lolly, the sandcastle flag</p>

<p>It came just weeks after Dudolf challenged players to find the snake hiding in a jungle-themed seek-and-find puzzle.</p>

<p>The brainteaser shows a jungle scene in shades of green, with birds flitting between branches and thick foliage in the background. </p>

<p>But the single slithering snake is almost impossible to find. </p>

<p>The brainteaser, created by children's illustrator Gergely Dudás, from Budapest, Hungary, shows a mass of green and yellow leaves with misleading parrots </p>

<p>The challenging graphic, produced by the illustrator of Fox &amp; Rabbit, prompted fans of Dudolf's work to say it is 'very difficult'. </p>

<p>If you're looking for a place to start, begin by working from left to right and look closely between the leaves to see if anything is hiding.</p>

<p>Try not to be put off by the vine leaves and parrots as you weave you way through the jungle to find the snake. </p>

<p>And if you are still struggling, try looking closely at the patterns on the leaves to spot the creature. </p>

<p>Give up? Then scroll down to find the answer highlighted among the faded jungle scene. </p>

<p>The snake can be seen on the left-hand side of the jungle graphic hiding between the leaves</p>
