<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The air bridge to Portugal is up - and that means the joys of the Algarve are available once more to British holidaymakers.</p>

<p>Here we present 10 of the very best deals for this summer for locations including Albufeira, Olhao and Vilamoura.</p>

<p>SEAFOOD AND CASTLES</p>

<p>Alvor beach - just outside the town of Alvor - is where most of the tourist accommodation in this area is clustered </p>

<p>About four miles west of Praia da Rocha, in the Algarve, the town of Alvor has a charming harbour with fishing boats and seafood restaurants. It’s an ancient settlement with the ruins of a 13th-century castle up a hill.</p>

<p>There is also a beach outside the centre, where most tourist accommodation is clustered. Great birdwatching on the peninsular by the mouth of the River Alvor; guided tours are available.</p>

<p>Praia da Oura is a fine sandy beach, with a rocky bluff, topped by pines and a coastal path at its western end leading to the busy, popular tourist resort of Albufeira. There is plenty going on close by, though with good restaurants and jolly bars.</p>

<p>The golden sands, 900 metres long, can get overcrowded in normal years; the quietest parts are at the eastern end.</p>

<p>With its whitewashed buildings and lanes lined with bars and restaurants, Albufeira is one of the Algarve’s best spots for letting your hair down.</p>

<p>The beach is reached via a tunnel from the main square —and it’s a beauty with fine golden sands. A day trip to the picturesque village of Alte, one of the prettiest in the region, or to see the cathedral and castle in Silves is recommended.</p>

<p>One of the most developed stretches of coast on the Algarve — but Praia da Rocha is popular for a reason: its excellent sandy beach backed by low, ochre-hued cliffs.</p>

<p>GOLF GALORE</p>

<p>The lovely beach of Praia do Ancao, pictured, from where nature trails run along the coastline</p>

<p>Portugal's ambassador to the UK says British holidaymakers shouldn't hesitate in visiting Portugal. Pictured is the city of Faro </p>

<p>We are very happy! Finally, there will be many British tourists coming to my country now that the quarantine requirement has been lifted.</p>

<p>It has been a challenging time — a time of frequent, open dialogue with our British colleagues, where we repeatedly gave our point of view that it was safe to travel to Portugal. This was not fully accepted. But now that has changed, which is great news.</p>

<p>Of course, the absence of British tourists has been noticeable and has made life difficult for our tourism sector. In the Algarve, from where I have just returned after spending my holidays there, it was not the same as usual. The British were much missed.</p>

<p>I go every year to the Algarve and, this time, I stayed for ten days in Baia, a resort near Albufeira. There were fewer people on the beaches than usual. But I was pleased to see that, despite the difficulties, businesses continued.</p>

<p>The atmosphere was quiet and confident, waiting for change to come.</p>

<p>I did not see any signs of fear or worry. People were respecting fully the health rules. They were happy, perfectly at ease.</p>

<p>I want readers of the Daily Mail to know that autumn is a good time to go to Portugal, especially the Algarve. </p>

<p>British tourists should come to Portugal in full confidence, says the ambassador. Pictured is Carvoeiro beach </p>

<p>September is the high season for golfers and we have plenty of courses for players of all standards.</p>

<p>From the end of October, those who like lower temperatures, less sunlight, attractive landscapes, playing sports and so on will realise that Portugal is a fantastic destination.</p>

<p>British tourists should come to Portugal in full confidence that we will welcome you and offer the very best in friendship and hospitality. So please don’t hesitate.</p>

<p>Quinta do Lago is a big, luxury golf resort with two top-class courses. Its rolling, well-manicured landscape leads to a lovely beach, Praia do Ancao, from where nature trails run along the coastline. There are a choice of apartments and hotels. </p>

<p>The England football team stay here when playing international matches at Estadio Algarve, close to Faro, the Algarve’s capital.</p>

<p>Best thing? Golfers will love it.</p>

<p>Details: A week at the five-star Conrad Algarve spa hotel is from £1,090pp, departing on September 12 from Heathrow (ba.com).</p>

<p>Details: A week at the Monchique Resort &amp; Spa is from £917, departing on September 13 from Stansted (onthebeach.co.uk).</p>

<p>PEACEFUL SOUTH</p>

<p>The fishing port of Olhao, which is six miles east of the city of Faro. Expect narrow streets with tiled buildings and a superb fish market</p>

<p>Olhao is a fishing port that is home to the well-known Bela sardine brand and is six miles east of Faro.</p>

<p>It’s a relaxing spot within the Ria Formosa Natural Park by an estuary sheltered by the islands of Culatra and Armona. Expect narrow streets with tiled buildings and a superb fish market designed by Gustave Eiffel, no less. A boat trip to the secluded beaches on Culatra is a must.</p>
