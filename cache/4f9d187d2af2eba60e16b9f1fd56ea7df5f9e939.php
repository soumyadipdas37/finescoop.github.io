<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Amazon's crew filmed a heated row between Tottenham left back Danny Rose and manager Jose Mourinho last season after the he dropped from the team, with the defender storming out of his office.  </p>

<p>Rose struggled for game time under the Portuguese boss following his arrival in November – starting just one Premier League game in a 1-0 defeat to Liverpool in January – and ended up joining Newcastle on loan shortly after. </p>

<p>The outspoken star has failed to nail down a regular spot in the first team in recent years and threatened to wind down the last 18 months of his contract and leave for nothing after Daniel Levy's failed attempts to sell him last summer. After Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino, he had hoped to turn over a new leaf. </p>

<p>Danny Rose requests a meeting with Jose Mourinho in Tottenham's Amazon documentary</p>

<p>The outspoken star tells the Portuguese boss he is far from happy with his lack of playing time </p>

<p>Amazon's crew filmed the row inside Mourinho's office in episode five of the documentary </p>

<p>The left back eventually joined Newcastle United on loan in pursuit of more opportunities </p>

<p>But the England international – who is one of the longest-serving players at the club having joined in 2007 – continued to be frustrated. Mourinho quickly took a liking to Spurs youngster Japhet Tanganga, who emerged as the first choice left back after an impressive run of form. </p>

<p>Rose had been picked to start in one of the biggest games of the season against the Reds, but left Mourinho unimpressed with his performance and was hauled off after 69 minutes. </p>

<p>In episode five of Tottenham's All or Nothing documentary, Rose asked to speak with the head coach after being left out of the next handful of games and demanded to know what the 'problem' was.</p>

<p>Mourinho picked him to start against Liverpool but was left unimpressed by his performance </p>

<p>Youngster Japhet Tanganga emerged as first choice left back after some consistent displays </p>

<p>Rose threatened to stay at home if he didn't get more minutes on the pitch, saying: 'Gaffer, I just want to know exactly what the problem is. </p>

<p>When Mourinho asked what he means, the defender replied: 'You know exactly what I mean, how I'm being treated. I was very excited when you came as manager, but if you don't want me to play, I'd rather you just tell me now, and I'll stay at home, and I'll train at home.'</p>

<p>Mourinho explained to Rose that he picked him for the Liverpool game after impressing him in training but was left disappointed with his display – admitting Tanganga's consistency left him with no choice but to keep starting him. </p>

<p>The ex-Chelsea boss admitted to Rose that he could not guarantee he would be first choice</p>

<p>Danny Rose's explosive showdown with Jose Mourinho is the highlight of All or Nothing so far</p>

<p>Sportsmail also discusses the SEVEN things we've learned from episodes 4-6 in Amazon Prime's newest All or Nothing series</p>

<p>'Let me try to be as open as I can with you, because I think you deserve that. When I arrived, you played some matches, you were on the bench some matches, I didn't select you in other matches.</p>

<p>'The week before Liverpool you were fantastic in training and that made me decide that in the most difficult game against the most difficult opponent, you play. </p>

<p>'I think you didn't play well. The next game against Middlesbrough Tanganga played so well, and is so strong defensively, and doesn't make any kind of mistakes because he's so fast and so powerful. I cannot say, you're going to be first choice, you're going to play every match. It depends on you.'</p>

<p>The 30-year-old admitted he wasn't good enough against Liverpool but insists he hadn't been given a run of games to improve and carve out some consistency. He then launches a stinging attack on his Spurs team-mates and claims they have been picked despite playing 's***'. </p>

<p>Rose complained that many of his team-mates had played 's***' but were still being picked </p>

<p>He stormed out of Mourinho's office and said it was 'unfair' to be left out of the team  </p>

<p>'Do you want me to be man of the match and give my best performance when I play one game and then I don't play again for three or four weeks?' he adds.</p>

<p>'I wasn't good against Liverpool, it wasn't my best game, but other people have been s*** in training, s*** in games, but are in the squad every game. It's not fair.'</p>

<p>When Mourinho replies 'it's your perspective', a furious Rose starts walking out of the room and demands to speak to Levy. </p>

<p>'It's facts. The whole changing room know it's facts. And I'm going to see Daniel as well, so when Daniel's in tell him I'm looking for him.'</p>

<p>As Rose leaves the office, Mourinho tells him: 'I think you are an honest guy', with the player responding: 'Yeah, well that's the problem.'</p>

<p>He made 12 starts after joining the Magpies on loan but faces an uncertain future back at Spurs</p>

<p>Rose has never been afraid to speak his mind and has clashed with the club in the past </p>

<p>The Liverpool game proved to be Rose's last appearance for the north London side as he was shipped out to Newcastle before deadline day in pursuit of first team football. He was started 12 times by Steve Bruce in all competitions as he helped the Magpies to a 13th-placed finish. </p>

<p>This is not the first time Rose has butted heads with the club. In 2017 he claimed he was not being paid enough and criticised the club for not showing enough ambition and 'signing players you have to Google'.</p>

<p>He joined the club as a 16-year-old in 2007 from Leeds United and has gone on to make 214 appearances – starting in the Champions League final defeat to Liverpool. Since returning from his loan at Newcastle, he has been linked with a return to his boyhood side at Elland Road.  </p>
