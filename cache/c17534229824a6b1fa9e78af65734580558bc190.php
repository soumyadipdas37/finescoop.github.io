<p>Heartbreaking: Earlier this week, Krystal shared her struggle with deciding to go ahead with  being induced, despite wanting her third child to arrive naturally</p>

<p>It also followed a number of failed attempts to induce labour naturally.</p>

<p>'I just wanted him there, obviously with what happened last time with my hemorrhage,' she told her Instagram followers.</p>

<p>'I would feel more secure if he was there on the day that I'm going to be giving birth. I've had to make a call and not feeling great about it.'  </p>

<p>Soothing waters: Krystal (pictured) decided to make the call to be induced on Wednesday after learning her doctor was going to be away for the weekend</p>

<p>Krystal revealed she was expecting her third child in March, but was told by doctors to be 'cautiously optimistic' about the pregnancy.</p>

<p>She almost suffered a miscarriage at 13 weeks, which would have been her third if complications persisted.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Krystal and the baby pulled through and the family are eager to welcome their new addition.</p>
