<p>The occupants of a water truck are lucky to be alive after their vehicle was smashed to smithereens by a train as they were crossed the track,</p>

<p>The lucky escape occurred in Utah this Friday, and if that were not extraordinary enough, the entire incident was caught on camera. </p>

<p>James Wood,  theYouTube user who posted the video explained that he was recording the train in Wellington for his four-year-old son who is a big fan of Thomas the Tank Engine when the wreck happened.</p>

<p>The danger zone: The truck driver pulls across the rails, seemingly oblivious to the onrushing train</p>

<p>No escape: Suddenly, the train hurtles into view, and there's no way now that a collision can be averted</p>

<p>James, known on YouTube as Rammn8r, said ‘I turned away for a moment just before the collision to see how long the train was and heard what sounded like a stick of dynamite exploding, only to turn back to see the truck being mauled to death by the train,’ </p>

<p>The semi-truck was hit near its back wheels, and spun around. Police said the driver did not see the train coming.</p>

<p>Impact: the video captures the moment that the train smashes into the truck</p>

<p>Demolition derby: It's scarcely credible, but the two occupants of the truck walked away from this scene of destruction</p>

<p>The man who witnessed the collision was stunned for a moment, but then gathered himself and rushed to the aid of the people inside the demolished truck, expecting to see dead bodies inside. </p>

<p>Miraculously, the occupants of the water truck escaped unharmed.   </p>

<p>‘That was one heck of a ride for them, and they are the luckiest men I know,’ the eyewitness wrote.  ‘I literally witnessed a miracle because despite the fact that the train destroyed the truck, the men inside were okay and they are alive.’</p>

<p>The conductor of the train reported that the train crew were also uninjured, according to Fox 13</p>
