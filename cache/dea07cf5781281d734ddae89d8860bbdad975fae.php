<p>According to a family friend, the 64-year-old matriarch - who has six children from her marriages to the late Robert Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner - doesn't plan to tie the knot with longtime partner Corey Gamble.</p>

<p>'Kris is still with Corey but she's not engaged and they won't get engaged,' a friend told The Sun. 'She will never get married again. This works for her.'</p>

<p>No thanks: Kris Jenner will never wed again, a friend told The Sun. Seen with Robert Kardashian at their nuptials in 1978. They divorced in 1991</p>

<p>The couple met at designer Riccardo Tisci's 40th birthday bash in Ibiza in 2014.</p>

<p>Two years ago, Kris fueled speculation she was engaged to 39-year-old toyboy Corey.</p>

<p>The momager sparked rumours she and her boyfriend had taken their relationship to the next level after she was spotted numerous times sporting a huge diamond on her ring finger, but she refused to answer any questions on the subject.</p>

<p>The second time: And the 64-year-old star was wed to Bruce Jenner from 1991 until 2015; seen at their wedding with Kim, Kourtney and Khloe in attendance</p>

<p>The good years: Together they welcomed Kendall and Kylie; seen in the 1990s</p>

<p>They went their separate ways: After they split, Bruce transitioned into Caitlyn Jenner; Kris and Cait in November 2015</p>

<p>Instead, during a game of 'Spill Your Guts or Fill Your Guts' while appearing as a guest on James Corden's 'Late Late Show', Kris opted to eat dead crickets rather than reveal whether or not she was engaged.</p>

<p>She said: 'No, I am not going to answer.'</p>

<p>As she struggled to eat the insects, James laughed and said the ring answered the question on its own - but the 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' star then slipped up with her response.</p>

<p>They will not walk down the aisle:Â 'Kris is still with Corey but she's not engaged and they won't get engaged,' a friend told The Sun; seen in February in Hollywood</p>

<p>She retorted: 'This is not the ring.'</p>

<p>The host replied: 'But there is a ring!'</p>

<p>Kris refused to say any more and also opted to down a sardine smoothie rather than choose which of her daughters she'd axe from their E! reality show - which it was recently revealed will end next year - if she had to choose one.</p>

<p>She said: 'I'm not gonna turn on one of my girls. Those are my babies.</p>

<p>'Trust me, they wouldn't have understood. I couldn't have gone home. I would just have to go to another city.'</p>

<p>The end: The Kardashians announced the finish of Keeping Up With The Kardashians will happen in 2021 with season 20</p>
