<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The horrifying cost of Boris Johnson’s six-month Covid clampdown was dramatically laid bare last night.</p>

<p>Business chiefs and hospitality groups issued a string of dire warnings over the impact of the restrictions, saying millions of jobs were now on the line.</p>

<p>They said the Prime Minister’s U-turn on his ‘get back to work’ message could spell doom for struggling high streets, with footfall plummeting and shops boarded up.</p>

<p>In a passionate intervention, a prominent entrepreneur said the prosperity of the nation was at stake. </p>

<p>In a passionate intervention to Boris Johnson’s six-month Covid clampdown, Julian Metcalfe, who founded Pret A Manger and Itsu, says the prosperity of the nation is now at stake</p>

<p>Julian Metcalfe, who founded Pret A Manger and Itsu, said: ‘The repercussions of this six months are going to be devastating to so many, to local councils, to industry, to people all over our country.</p>

<p>‘We have not begun to touch the seriousness of this. This talk of six months is criminal.’</p>

<p>Despite ballooning national debt, Rishi Sunak is preparing a multi-billion-pound ‘winter economy plan’ to try to protect jobs.</p>

<p>The Chancellor signalled the true extent of the crisis by cancelling plans for a full-scale Budget in November. Sources said he accepted the country could no longer make long-term financial decisions.</p>

<p>As the Archbishops of Canterbury and York warned of the economic costs of Covid:</p>

<p>In a dramatic television address to the nation on Tuesday, Mr Johnson announced he was abruptly dropping his call – made repeatedly since the end of lockdown – for workers to return to the office. He also told pubs and restaurants to shut their doors at 10pm, and doubled fines for not wearing a mask or failing to obey the rule of six.</p>

<p>He indicated the measures were likely to last for six months at least.</p>

<p>Mr Metcalfe led the backlash against the curbs on BBC Radio 4’s World at One, saying he did not know whether Itsu could survive the measures.</p>

<p>He added: ‘People who work in hotels, restaurants, takeaways and in coffee shops are devastated. A great many are closing down – we’re losing thousands upon thousands of jobs. </p>

<p>'How long can this continue, this vague “work from home”, “don’t go on public transport”? The ramifications of this are just enormous.’</p>

<p>Mr Metcalfe accused the Prime Minister of ‘sitting down with his Union Jack talking utter nonsense’.</p>

<p>He said: ‘To turn to an entire nation and say “stay at home for six months”, and to spout off Churchillian nonsense about we’ll make it through – it’s terribly unhelpful. It should be “we will review the situation each week, each hour”.’</p>

<p>Tory MP Desmond Swayne said the Government had made the wrong call, adding: ‘I am concerned the cure could be worse than the disease.’</p>

<p>Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale, warned the clampdown could see the closure of many pubs. </p>

<p>‘Pub-goers and publicans alike want to stop the spread of Covid, but this curfew is an arbitrary restriction that unfairly targets the hospitality sector and will have a devastating impact on pubs, jobs and communities,’ he added.</p>

<p>Rob Pitcher of Revolution Bars said: ‘It’s beyond belief that they have brought in the 10pm curfew with no evidence to back it up.’</p>

<p>Fashion mogul Sir Paul Smith warned the pandemic was proving devastating to his and other industries.</p>

<p>A former head of the civil service will today say Mr Johnson’s government has proved incapable of combating Covid.</p>

<p>Lord O’Donnell, a crossbench peer, will say in a lecture that ministers did not use adequate data and deferred too much to medical science at the expense of behavioural and economic experts. </p>

<p>He will also allege there has been a lack of strong leadership and clear strategy. </p>
