<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Cardinal George Pell is returning to Rome six months after he was acquitted of child sexual abuse in Australia. </p>

<p>The former Vatican treasurer, 79, will depart Sydney on Tuesday, after living in the city since his release from a Victorian jail, but the reason for his visit is unknown.    </p>

<p>Joshua McElwee, from US newspaper the National Catholic Reporter, said the purpose of Cardinal Pell's visit to the Vatican was unclear.</p>

<p>'At the moment he has no official role here,' Mr McElwee told ABC News.   </p>

<p>Catholic Cardinal George Pell (pictured) is expected to fly to Rome on Tuesday. The former Vatican treasurer came back to Australia in mid-2017 to fight sexual assault charges</p>

<p>Cardinal Pell (pictured leaving court in February 2019) was convicted in December 2018 but the High Court of Australia overturned the conviction in April and he was released from jail </p>

<p>Mr McElwee said it was 'very likely' Cardinal Pell was travelling to Rome to 'put his affairs in order'.   </p>

<p>'I imagine he still has personal items here, things to bring home, perhaps an apartment to clean up. </p>

<p>'I don't know what else he would be doing other than those kind of things,' he explained.     </p>

<p>Cardinal Pell came back to Australia from Rome in mid-2017 to fight charges related to the sexual assault of two choirboys when he was Archbishop of Melbourne in the late 1990s. </p>

<p>He was convicted in December 2018 and served just over a year of a six-year sentence in jail before the High Court of Australia overturned the conviction in April and he was released. </p>

<p>Cardinal Pell had been head of the Vatican's Secretariat of the Economy, tasked with cleaning up the church's vast finances and eliminating abuse, and had taken a leave of absence from that role when he came back to Australia.</p>

<p>'He always intended to return to Rome,' Katrina Lee, an adviser to the Archdiocese of Sydney, told Reuters. </p>

<p>His return to Rome comes just days after a powerful Vatican cardinal, Giovanni Becciu, was fired after Pope Francis accused him of embezzlement and nepotism.</p>

<p>Cardinal Pell and Cardinal Becciu were reportedly previously at odds over reform of the Vatican's accounts.</p>

<p>'The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances,' Cardinal Pell told the Catholic News Agency on September 25.</p>

<p>'He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments.</p>

<p>'I hope the cleaning of the stables continues in both the Vatican and Victoria,' Cardinal Pell said.   </p>
