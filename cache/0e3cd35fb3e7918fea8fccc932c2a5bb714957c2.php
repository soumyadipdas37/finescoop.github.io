<p>He will be at the Riverside Stadium on Saturday to watch his new team play Bournemouth in the Championship.</p>

<p>'I'm delighted to finally have got him,' said Boro manager Neil Warnock, who will coach his side against Bournemouth via Zoom following a positive Covid-19 test.</p>

<p>'He's been my No 1 choice. I've wanted him for a long time. I'd like to give a big thanks to [chief executive] Neil Bausor for getting it done.</p>

<p>'I told him what we were doing at the club and right from day one he wanted to come and I'm delighted.'</p>

<p>Akpom spent two seasons with PAOK in Greece, helping them win a league and cup double</p>

<p>The forward previously played for Arsenal, making 12 appearances for the Gunners' first team</p>
