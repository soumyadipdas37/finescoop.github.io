<p>Fans and self-employed sculptors Nick Dutton and Gavin Fulcher were behind the 11ft statue, which appeared outside The Forum, where it will remain until Sunday, the BBC reported.</p>

<p>Alan Partridge is a character who was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and portrayed by actor Steve Coogan. </p>

<p>An enormous brass statue of Alan Partridge, designed and created by fans and sculptors Nick Dutton and Gavin Fulcher, has appeared outside The Forum in Norwich</p>

<p>The Twitter account for the Bafta award-winning character shared its approval for the statue. </p>

<p>The thread of tweets said: 'A STATEMENT. Although this is completely unauthorised, having taken counsel, I am happy that the statue's attitude and stance are correct.</p>

<p>'If the people of Norwich and surrounding areas want to memorialise me in sculpture, then as long as it is rendered in alpha brass with a low zinc content and not, say, a duplex brass, I grant my consent and will instruct my legal team to resheathe their daggers. </p>

<p>'If my statue can in some way act as an Ambassador for Brass, and encourage just ten children to take up a brass instrument, it will be an upbeat ending to an otherwise dreadful year.'  </p>

<p>Alan Partridge is a character who was born in King's Lynn, Norfolk, and portrayed by actor Steve Coogan</p>

<p>Mr Fulcher said: 'During this time we could all do with a bit of light relief'. Pictured: People take photos of the statue on their phones</p>

<p>Mr Fulcher said Alan Partridge was synonymous with the city and that people instantly mention the character when someone says they're from Norwich. </p>

<p>He said the statue was 'just a bit of fun' and said 'during this time we could all do with a bit of light relief'. </p>

<p>The pair designed the statue based on measurements taken from a friend who was a 'similar size and build' to Coogan, who is 5ft 9in. </p>

<p>The brass statue was created and designed over three years by the pair, in between their work commitments in the film industry. </p>

<p>Alan Partridge made his debut appearance in 1991 as a sports presenter on BBC Radio 4's On The Hour and Coogan announced this year he would play the character again in an 18-part series called From The Oasthouse: The Alan Partridge Podcast. </p>

<p>Mr Dutton and Mr Fulcher denied the statue was a publicity stunt to promote Partridge's latest podcast.   </p>

<p>A tweet on the Alan Partridge Twitter account said that 'the statue's attitude and stance are correct'</p>
