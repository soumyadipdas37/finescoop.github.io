<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Workers could soon be allowed to work just four days a week or enjoy more annual leave than ever before if flexible working from home proposals are given the green light. </p>

<p>Employees and bosses will be able to agree on flexible working from home arrangements during the coronavirus pandemic under a proposal from the Fair Work Commission.</p>

<p>But there are concerns the generous new working model, designed to help Australians ease back into the office during the pandemic, could bankrupt small businesses who rely on commuters footfall.</p>

<p>Fair Work Commission president Iain Ross has released a draft plan to change awards, including a provision allowing working from home arrangements that 'balance personal and work responsibilities' against the employer's business needs.</p>

<p>The Fair Work Commission have proposed a draft to change awards after COVID-19 to include working from home clauses including double annual leave (pictured, a woman on holiday)</p>

<p>Employees could be able to compress their week, so usual hours are worked over fewer days as long as the usual workload is complete.</p>

<p>Starting and finishing times could also be staggered and employees directed to work at home or other locations.</p>

<p>Workers could even opt to take double the annual leave at half pay and also buy extra time off if bosses agree.</p>

<p>With the agreement of three quarters of a workforce, a cut to hours could be shared if an employer can't usefully use all emplopyees. </p>

<p>Justice Ross said working from home had been one of the most significant shifts since the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>'It is likely the direct economic and social impacts of the pandemic will be felt for some time to come,' he said.</p>

<p>Additions to contracts could include working from home agreements such as start times, location and compressing your work hours to work less days (stock image)</p>

<p>Despite working from home benefits, many Australian workers have expressed a keenness to return to the office. Pictured: a pedestrian wearing a face mask travels in Sydney CBD amid the coronavirus pandemic in August</p>

<p>'There will (likely) be a continuing need for flexible work arrangements to assist employers and employees in adapting to the changed conditions and to support the recovery.'</p>

<p>The draft proposal could be potentially be included in modern awards, most of which don't explicitly deal with working from home.</p>

<p>The Fair Work Commission's proposal could see staff reaching mutual agreements with their employers on a range of flexible working measures.</p>

<p>Potential sanctions include: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Employees making agreements to balance personal and work responsibilities with the needs of their employer </p></li>
<li><p>The potential to compress your working week to work more hours on fewer days</p></li>
<li><p>Altered starting times and locations</p></li>
<li><p>Taking double annual leave at half pay </p></li>
</ul>

<p>The commission president said that could constrain working from home arrangements if business was forced to pay penalty rates or overtime, despite employees seeking flexibility.</p>

<p>Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said the draft was an important initiative which would deliver flexibility.</p>

<p>'A very large number of employees are currently working from home, and it is evident that workplaces will never be the same again,' he said on Tuesday. </p>

<p>The economy is said to be suffering thanks to an increase in working from home, with small CBD businesses struggling due to a lack of foot-traffic from reduced onsite workers.</p>

<p>Office vacancy rates in Sydney and Melbourne have jumped dramatically in the last six months, as businesses steady themselves for the lasting effects of the pandemic. </p>

<p>But many Australian workers have not expressed keenness to return to the office.</p>

<p>Research conducted by office portal company Equiem found 46 per cent of Australians surveyed claimed they were more productive working from home.</p>

<p>But some like Sydney recruiter Jen Davis have a yearning for office culture and the unity of a team environment. </p>

<p>'Being home is great for being able to get through the workload, but I find the being in the office great for connecting and engaging with people who do come in at the same time as me,' Ms Davis said.</p>

<p>Ms Davis believes many workers like to be in the office for work to distinguish a difference between their home and professional life.</p>

<p>'Some people still do believe that unless you’re in the office you’re not technically working or there are questions over where you are and what you’re doing,' she said.</p>

<p>'It should be measured on output as opposed to location.'</p>
