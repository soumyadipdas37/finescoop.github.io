<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Designs for an all-electric 'flying taxi' that will be able to carry up to four passengers from London to Brighton in just 30 minutes have been unveiled by a British firm.</p>

<p>The zero-emission flyer — the 'VA-1X' — will use Formula 1 tech to reach top cruising speeds of around 150 miles per hour and a maximum range of some 100 miles.</p>

<p>Bristol-based designers Vertical Aerospace said that the craft is set to be the first winged, electric vertical-take-off-and-landing (eVTOL) craft to be certified.</p>

<p>The firm expects that the VA-1X will begin commercial flights in 2024 — whizzing right over ground-based traffic — following flight testing which will begin next year.</p>

<p>According to Vertical Aerospace, trips in the craft will likely end up costing travellers around £5–10 per mile travelled — between that of a helicopter and a private car.</p>

<p>The VA-1X is the spiritual successor of the firm's previous design — dubbed the Seraph — which, unlike the VA-1X, was a multicopter with twelve pairs of blades.</p>

<p>While the underlying principle was different, the VA-1X has been designed with the experience gained from developing the Seraph, its batteries and its flight controls.</p>

<p>Designs for an all-electric 'flying taxi', pictured, that will be able to carry up to four passengers from London to Brighton in just 30 minutes have been unveiled by a British firm</p>

<p>The zero-emission flyer — the 'VA-1X', pictured — will use Formula 1 tech to reach top cruising speeds of around 150 miles per hour and a maximum range of some 100 miles</p>

<p>Wingspan: 49 feet (15 metres)</p>

<p>Length: 43 feet (13 metres)</p>

<p>Maximum payload: 992 lbs (450 kg)</p>

<p>Capacity: 1 pilot and 4 passengers</p>

<p>Power source: Lithium-ion batteries </p>

<p>Noise: 30x less than a helicopter </p>

<p>Commercial flights begin: 2024 </p>

<p>'eVTOL technology will revolutionise travel, combining the safety of commercial airlines with the disruptive environmental and cost benefits of the electrification of flight,' said Vertical Aerospace CEO Michael Cervenka.</p>

<p>'With the launch of the VA-1X, we’re proud to be taking eVTOL one step closer to mass-market adoption and supporting the next era of aviation.'</p>

<p>'At Vertical Aerospace, we believe that people should be able to quickly and affordably get from A to B without sacrificing the planet.'</p>

<p>'With the VA-1X, this vision will start to be realised in under five years.'</p>

<p>Vertical Aerospace — which is presently seeking external investment to raise the £150 million needed to bring the VA-1X to commercial reality — is collaborating on the project with the US aerospace firm Honeywell, who will be developing control systems.</p>

<p>The design of the craft is employing of technology originally developed for Formula 1 racing — including the use of lightweight composite materials. </p>

<p>Construction of the VA-1X is expected to begin shortly in the UK — with the design drawn up to meet the same safety standards as conventional aircraft.</p>

<p>The craft will be 43 feet in length with a 49 feet wingspan, ensuring that it will be small enough to depart off and land on existing helipads — while its aerodynamic form will require far less energy to fly than its chopper counterparts.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the flying taxi's distributed propulsion system is expected will make it some 30 time quieter than a helicopter. </p>

<p>Vertical Aerospace said that they have developed the VA-1X with the mind to sell them to air taxi or cargo fleet operators — however, there is also the potential for the firm to sell the craft to individual customers.</p>

<p>Although it is not yet known how much the craft will cost to manufacture or purchase, the firm told MailOnline that it will be 'less than a helicopter.'</p>

<p>'Honeywell is honoured to be working with Vertical to enable this major advancement with our compact fly-by-wire and UAM [urban air mobility] -optimised flight deck technologies,' said Honeywell vice president Stéphane Fymat.</p>

<p>Fly-by-wire tech involves the replacement of traditional manual aircraft controls with an electronic interface that translates pilot inputs into a desired outcome and uses a feedback process to ensure that the vehicle responds accordingly.</p>

<p>'The VA-1X is a beautiful vehicle and an important technical milestone for the urban air mobility industry,' Mr Fymat added. </p>
