<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Spanish media have collectively rejoiced after LaLiga chiefs threw their backing behind Barcelona regarding Lionel Messi's transfer status.</p>

<p>The saga of the summer took another twist on Sunday evening, after La Liga issued an official statement placing all power with Barca regarding the player's immediate future.</p>

<p>They ruled that Messi's astronomical £630million (€700m) release clause is still active, given that the player did not issue his desire to trigger an option to leave for free before June 10.</p>

<p>As a result, the league maintain they will not be deregistering Messi as a La Liga player until the release clause is officially met. </p>

<p>'What is the price?': Spanish media asked the question on Monday after La Liga backed Barca</p>

<p>Headlines have been swamped with news of La Liga standing behind the €700m buy-out fee</p>

<p>Spanish daily Marca ask the question, 'what is the price?', before accompanying the headline with an image of Messi holding up his fingers.</p>

<p>Likewise, Catalan outlet Mundo Deportivo go bold on the simple headline of '700 millones,' giving hope to Barca fans across the entire region that Messi's exit may not materalise after all.  </p>

<p>On Sunday evening La Liga went public with their status, showing a clear determination to abide by the fine-print of the law and also keep a grip on the world's most famous footballer.</p>

<p>Messi has made clear his desire to leave following Barca's European capitulation in Lisbon</p>

<p>The statement read: 'The contract is currently in force and has a "termination clause" applicable to the event that Lionel Andrés Messi decides to urge the early unilateral termination of the contract, carried out in accordance with article 16 of Royal Decree 1006/1985, of June 26, by which regulates the special employment relationship of professional athletes.</p>

<p>'In compliance with the applicable regulations, and following the corresponding procedure in these cases, LaLiga will not carry out the prior visa process for the player to be removed from the federation if they have not previously paid the amount (£630million) of said clause.' </p>

<p>This therefore means Manchester City will need to pay the £630m release clause to sign the Argentinian star this summer, or strike a transfer agreement with Barca in the market before the October 6 deadline.</p>

<p>AS document how fans waited for Messi to return to training, but he never showed up</p>

<p>This could impact the deal as Messi's overall transfer package will now be larger, given his wages and image rights payments.</p>

<p>Messi’s fixed salary totals £64m (€71m) but bonuses for signing, for staying, and for winning trophies takes the figure well above that.</p>

<p>Just by playing 60 per cent of games until the 2021 date when his contract ends sees Messi earn on average £95m (€106m) a season. But the potential – if he were to win the treble and win FIFA's player of the year award – exists to push the final figure over the £110m (€122m) mark. </p>

<p>With these wages and an eye-watering transfer fee, City would struggle to comply with the Financial Fair Play rules as set down by UEFA.</p>
