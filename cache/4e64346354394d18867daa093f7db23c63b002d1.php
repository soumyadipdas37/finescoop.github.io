<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>California will not accept any new unemployment claims for the next two weeks after its systems were overwhelmed by a flood of cases during the pandemic. </p>

<p>The two-week 'pause' will allow the Employment Development Department to try and clear a backlog of 600,000 claims that has built up in the wake of lockdown.</p>

<p>It comes after a strike team set up by Governor Gavin Newsom found the backlog is still growing by around 10,000 cases per day, despite employment rates improving in recent months.</p>

<p>California will not accept any new unemployment claims for two week as it tries to clear a backlog of 600,000 cases that built up during the pandemic shutdown (file)</p>

<p>The 'pause' will also allow IT staff to update their systems meaning that new claims can be processed faster in the future, which will stop the problem happening again, a spokesman said. The new systems will also include enhanced fraud prevention.  </p>

<p>California Labour Secretary Julie Su added: 'The work of the strike team marks a key turning point to re-focus and re-center the provision of unemployment insurance for the good of all Californians.'</p>

<p>More than 2.1million people were registered as unemployed in California in August, the most recent month for which data was available, the FDD said.</p>

<p>The figure is down slightly on previous months, but still 1.3million more than the same month last year.</p>

<p>The state's economy was hammered by coronavirus shutdowns in April and May that saw the unemployment rate soar to 16.4 per cent - higher than it was the depths of the 2010 Great Recession, when it hit 12.3 per cent. </p>

<p>The rate now stands at 11.4 per cent, the first month since April that it has been below the 2010 benchmark.</p>

<p>The shutdown comes after a 'strike team' ordered into the department by Governor Gavin Newsom (file) found the backlog is still growing at a rate of 10,000 cases per day</p>

<p>But even as the number of new claims falls, staff at the FDD have been struggling to keep up with their new workload.</p>

<p>A report published last week by Newsom's strike team found that the department is working over-capacity, with no realistic hope of catching up with a backlog of cases that have already taken more than 21 days to process. </p>

<p>The report recommended using new IT systems to automate as many claims as possible, freeing up staff to look at more complex cases that are causing delays.</p>

<p>The shutdown will only affect people filing an unemployment insurance case for the first time. </p>

<p>They will be redirected to a page where they can leave their details so they can be contacted once the system is back up and running again.</p>

<p>Those who have already applied will not have to do so again, and can still manage their claim online during the 'pause'.</p>

<p>California's unemployment rate soared to more than 16 per cent at the height of the pandemic shutdown, as more than 2million were left without work (pictured, a gym in Culver City)</p>

<p>Nationally, the unemployment rate peaked at more than 15 per cent during the coronavirus crisis, with a total of 26.4 million unemployment claims filed.</p>

<p>While national figures have also been improving in recent months - with the rate falling below 10 per cent in August - economists have warned that the pace of recovery is slowing as federal stimulus packages run dry.</p>

<p>America has been hit harder by coronavirus than any other country on earth, suffering 6.8million infections, though India - with 5.4million - has the world's fastest-growing outbreak and is due to overtake it in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The US has also suffered almost 200,000 deaths from the virus which is by far the highest global total. The next-highest is Brazil, which has recorded 136,000. </p>
