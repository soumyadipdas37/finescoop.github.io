<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea's £89m summer signing Kai Havertz may have stolen the show with a hat-trick in Wednesday's 6-0 Carabao Cup victory over Barnsley, but boss Frank Lampard has also lauded Thiago Silva's 'perfect 60 minutes' on his Blues debut. </p>

<p>Former PSG captain Silva moved to west London on a free from Paris Saint-Germain earlier this summer as part of Lampard's £230million overhaul of his squad.</p>

<p>And the 36-year-old gave a masterful defensive display on his first outing against Championship side Barnsley, leaving Lampard singing his praises.</p>

<p>Thiago Silva enjoyed an impressive Chelsea debut against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup</p>

<p>Chelsea boss Frank Lampard was delighted with Silva's dominant first outing for the Blues</p>

<p>'It was a perfect 60 minutes for him,' said Lampard of Silva's Chelsea debut.</p>

<p>'He will show the qualities he has. Of course, he will get fitter and better.</p>

<p>'He also gave us something, for me on the night, in the dressing room and on the pitch, of a leader with authority of his demands on others.</p>

<p>'He can't even speak the language at the minute but that's not even a problem because his presence and the way he commands people around him is already showing that to me in training and in our game.'</p>

<p>Lampard added: 'I am very pleased with Thiago. It is what I expected of a player of his level but it is very refreshing to have him here at the club.'</p>

<p>Germany international Havertz bagged a hat-trick to get off the mark for his new club while Tammy Abraham, Ross Barkley and Olivier Giroud also found the net at Stamford Bridge. </p>

<p>Forward Callum Hudson-Odoi also grabbed a rare Chelsea start on Wednesday, and left Lampard impressed.</p>

<p>'Callum did well, it's not easy when you're coming in and haven't had so many minutes,' he said. </p>

<p>Lampard is confident Silva will get better with every game he plays for Chelsea this season</p>
