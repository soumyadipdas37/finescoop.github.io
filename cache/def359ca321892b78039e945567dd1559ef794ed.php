<p>British beauty expert Elsa McAlonan says the end of August does not mean we need to say goodbye to our glowing skin</p>

<p>It may be the last day of August, but that doesn't mean we have to say goodbye to glowing skin.</p>

<p>Whatever the weather, highlighter can take us seamlessly from summer to autumn, adding a lit-from-within radiance and warm glow to faces and bodies.</p>

<p>Creamy formulas, such as the Bali Body Highlighter Stick, are kinder to mature skin.</p>

<p>Easy to apply, it comes in three shades, blends well and dries quickly.</p>

<p>THIS WORKS </p>

<p>One week to healthier, glowing skin? </p>

<p>It sounds too good to be true, but that's the promise made by the new Nivea Q10 Energy Glow Boosting Face Ampoule Serum (£17.99, superdrug.com). </p>

<p>This anti-ageing powerhouse cocktail of Q10 and vitamins E and C leaves skin moisturised and plumped up, with fewer visible fine lines.</p>

<p>WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT MY MASK RASH? </p>

<p>We've heard a lot about 'maskne' recently — break-outs caused by wearing a face covering — but some people suffer instead from irritated, itchy skin under their masks.</p>

<p>'If you notice an itchy, red rash rather than pimples, you may have contact dermatitis,' says cosmetic scientist Lynne Sanders, founder of Cosmetics A La Carte.</p>

<p>'Consider protecting your skin with a barrier cream. In my view, the best option is Vaseline.'</p>

<p>Vaseline Original should be applied before you put on your mask</p>

<p>Then use a gentle cleanser, such as Cosmetics A La Carte Total Lift Off, and moisturiser when you get home.  </p>

<p>3 OF THE BEST: ROSE WATERS</p>

<p>Grounded Organic Rose Water Toner is natural and nourishing. Infused with Damascena rose water and rich in anti-oxidants, it helps to calm skin and control excess oils. </p>

<p>hollandandbarrett.com </p>

<p>NUXE Very Rose Refreshing Toning Mist contains allantoin and feels soothing, which makes it especially suitable for those with sensitive skin. </p>

<p>Spritz on in the morning and at night after cleansing. </p>

<p>Suitable for dry skin, the hero ingredient of The Organic Pharmacy’s Rose Facial Spritz is Damask rose water, proven to increase the skin’s moisture levels. </p>

<p>SHAMELESS INDULGENCE </p>

<p>Building on the success of Lancome's citrussy floral fragrance Idole, the new, more flamboyant Idole L'Intense takes the key themes of rose, jasmine and chypre notes and turns up the sensuality.</p>

<p>Honeyed Grasse rose absolute combines with the fresh, green fragrance of Isparta rose petal essence to create the floral background. </p>

<p>Layered with a musky jasmine trio, with light hints of fruit, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood and Madagascar bourbon vanilla, it's a heady, exotic scent that is less feminine than feminist. </p>

<p>Lancome makes no bones about the fact it is squarely aimed at 'leaders and innovators of tomorrow'.</p>

<p>So if you're 'strong', 'outspoken' and 'empowered', this may well be the perfume for you.</p>
