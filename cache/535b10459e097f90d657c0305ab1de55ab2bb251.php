<p>A selection of air fryers in 1.5, 3.2 (pictured) and 5.3 litre capacities are stocked in Kmart</p>

<p>Photos of the meat proved so tantalising that they inspired others to buy air fryers to make their own. </p>

<p>'Perfectly cooked, that's how one should eat lamb,' one woman said.</p>

<p>Another added: 'Looks good, bit rare for me. I just bought an air fryer, will try it.'</p>

<p>Rather than slow cooking a roast in the oven for hours, an Australian woman has revealed how she cooked one kilogram of lamb from Woolworths in her 5.3 litre Kmart air fryer</p>

<p>To season the meat, the woman said she rolled the lamb in oil before coating it in garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.</p>

<p>She said she cooked the meat in the air fryer for 20 minutes, then flipped it over and left it to cook for a further 35 minutes. </p>

<p>'This gives a medium-rare cooked roast, internal temp was 47 degrees when I took it out before resting - the roast was so tender,' she said.</p>
