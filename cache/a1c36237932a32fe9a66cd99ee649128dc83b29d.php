<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ursula von der Leyen today announced the European Union is launching legal action against the UK over Boris Johnson's plans to tear up parts of the Brexit divorce deal. </p>

<p>Brussels had given Downing Street until the end of Septembet to scrap the Prime Minister's controversial proposals. </p>

<p>But the UK Government refused to budge and Ms von der Leyen said this morning that as a result the bloc has now started legal proceedings. </p>

<p>It has sent a 'letter of formal notice' to Number 10 which is the first step in the so-called 'infringement procedure'.</p>

<p>Speaking in Brussels she said: 'This draft bill is by its very nature a breach of the obligation of good faith laid down in the Withdrawal Agreement. </p>

<p>'More over if adopted as is it will be in full contradiction to the protocol of Ireland/Northern Ireland. </p>

<p>'The deadline lapsed yesterday. The problematic provisions have not been removed. </p>

<p>'Therefore this morning the Commission has decided to send the letter of formal notice to the UK Government. </p>

<p>'This is the first step in an infringement procedure. The letter invites the UK Government to send its observations within a month and besides this the Commission will continue to work hard towards a full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. We stand by our commitments.'  </p>
