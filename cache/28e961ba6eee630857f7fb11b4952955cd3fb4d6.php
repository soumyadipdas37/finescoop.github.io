<p>Emiliano Lombardi was attacked with pieces of broken mirror outside his home in East Cannington in Perth's south on August 16.</p>

<p>The 84-year-old was rushed to Royal Perth Hospital the next morning and remained in intensive care until his death 15 days later.</p>

<p>Emiliano Lombardi (pictured middle with son Dom) was horrifically bashed outside his house in Perth on August 16</p>

<p>'That roller coaster ride is unbearable,' Mr Lombardi told 9News. 'Those 15 days were complete torture.'</p>

<p>Australians were shocked at the gory images of Mr Lombardi's injuries which showed the great grandfather covered in blood.</p>

<p>Mr Lombardi had gone outside to investigate a disturbance at about 7pm when he was brutally slashed with the car mirror shards. </p>

<p>Ms Hussein said the image of her beaten father would haunt her forever.</p>

<p>'As soon as it goes quiet, I just see that image so that's going to be etched on my mind, I think for the rest of my life,' she said.</p>

<p>Laura Hussein (pictured) said the images of her beaten father would haunt her forever</p>

<p>Mr Lombardi was slashed with mirror shards after checking a noise near his home and suffered a broken nose, eye injuries, and numerous deep cuts</p>

<p>The brutal bashing has sparked calls for mandatory sentencing levels for people who commit attacks against the elderly.</p>

<p>Mr Lombardi said he did not think this would be a factor in changing the mindset of criminals.</p>

<p>'We should as a community be thinking "how do we prevent this from the beginning?"' he said. </p>

<p>WA Police have arrested two men as part of an investigation into the horrific bashing on August 20.</p>

<p>Both 28-year-old Quade Karsum Jones from Seville Grove and a 24-year-old man from Armadale were taken into custody.  </p>

<p>Jones, a roofing tradie, was charged over the attack on Mr Lombardi, an indecent assault on a woman in her 40s and an assault on a man and woman in their 20s.</p>

<p>Police will allege the attack on the great grandfather was committed as part of a rampage that lasted for an hour from 6.30pm and 7.30pm.</p>

<p>His charges include intent to do grievous bodily harm, indecent assault, robbery, and assault occasioning bodily harm.</p>

<p>Quade Karsum Jones (pictured) is one of the men who has been charged with Mr Lombardi's horrific attack</p>

<p>Mr Lombardi spent a week in an induced coma and underwent facial surgery at Royal Perth Hospital before he passed away</p>

<p>News of the attack prompted neighbours and local tradesmen to look after Mr Lombardi's home while he was hospitalised. </p>

<p>Businesses also offered to provide new furniture and bedding after his sheets were stained with blood.</p>
