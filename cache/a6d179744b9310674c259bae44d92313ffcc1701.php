<p>The brief video opens in the familiar halls of Bayside High School, with a school bell ringing. </p>

<p>However, no students come out of the classrooms, though a peacock does strut through the hallway.</p>

<p>When the peacock lets out a squawk, one of the lockers magically opens, likely mimicking the trick Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) used to open his locker while at Bayside High.</p>

<p>The project is one of the Peacock streaming service's highly-anticipated projects, bringing back several stars from the original show while following a whole new group of kids at Bayside High.</p>

<p>The show is set in present day, where Zack Morris has grown up to become the governor of California.</p>

<p>The official synopsis reveals that Morris 'gets into hot water for closing too many underfunded high schools.</p>

<p>In an attempt to fix this, he puts forth a new initiative where the affected students are sent to some of the state's most well-funded schools, including Bayside High.</p>

<p>The new students give, 'the privileged Bayside kids (who never have a problem that can't be solved in twenty-two minutes) a much-needed dose of reality.' </p>
