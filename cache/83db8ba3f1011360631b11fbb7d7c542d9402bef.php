<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Official school attendance records have shown that 99 per cent of schools have reopened since the coronavirus pandemic but as many as one pupil in 10 have not returned.  </p>

<p>Approximately 88 per cent of state school pupils were back in class on September 10, meaning that 12 per cent of children were marked absence.</p>

<p>Figures published by the Department for Education (DfE) indicate that this is a higher absence rate than the usual figure of around five per cent, but it is not broken down to show whether pupils were at home because of Covid outbreaks. </p>

<p> 92 per cent of schools were fully open on 10 September and attendance was higher in fully open schools with around 90 per cent of all pupils in fully open state-funded schools returning to their classrooms. </p>

<p>Approximately 88 per cent of state school pupils were back in class last Thursday, meaning that 12 per cent of children were marked absence (pictured: pupils from Year 11 at Hazelwood Integrated College are pictured during their first day back to the school in Belfast)</p>

<p>Around a quarter of schools did not supply information (pictured: parents walk their children into Bishop Road Primary School in Bristol as schools reopen)</p>

<p>Around a quarter of schools did not supply information, as school leaders warn that delays in testing are leading to year groups being sent home. </p>

<p>In early years settings, just 67 per cent of schools opened last Thursday, while 37 per cent of children who usually attend childcare went to class. </p>

<p>It comes as another 300 schools in England and Wales have sent class groups home after receiving positive test results. </p>

<p>Government guidance states that school attendance is mandatory from the beginning of the autumn term, while pupils or members of their households with coronavirus symptoms should not attend school. </p>

<p>If someone who has attended school is tested positive for Covid-19, pupils they have been in close contact with will be asked to self-isolate.   </p>

<p>One in eight state school students did not go back when classrooms reopened after this month the coronavirus lockdown, according to official figures (pictured: pupils on the first day back to school at Charles Dickens Primary School in Borough, South London)</p>

<p>DfE data show that two-thirds (67 per cent) of all early years settings were open on September 10, while 23 per cent were closed and 10 per cent had unknown status</p>

<p>DfE data show just 37 per cent of all early years students attended school on September 10</p>

<p>Schools are considered not fully open if they are unable to provide face-to-face teaching for all pupils on roll for the whole school day.</p>

<p>For most schools that reported they were not fully open, this was due to non-Covid-19 related reasons, the DfE release suggests.</p>

<p>Of all schools that responded, one per cent said they were not fully open due to suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus. </p>

<p>The DfE said it expected the figures for early years to settle in a few weeks, as some early years providers had started the term with inset days.</p>

<p>Just 18,000 children aged 0 to four classed as vulnerable were in early years settings, representing 21 per cent of children in this age group classified as 'Children in Need' or who have an Education, Health and Care Plan. </p>

<p>Thousands of students are having their return to school curtailed because of coronavirus outbreaks in the classroom amid a fiasco over testing.</p>

<p>He adteachers have warned that schools will 'grind to a halt' if teachers and pupils can't get tested quickly to avoid whole-school closure.</p>

<p>At least 30 schools have closed completely already because of cases and one headteacher in Preston said this morning that he already has two staff self-isolating at home and struggling to get tested, along with 10 children. </p>

<p>Pupils in Scotland had all returned by August 12, and they are also dealing with a number of outbreaks. And Northern Ireland schools were back in classrooms on August 31, despite a survey from NI's largest teaching union saying a majority of staff 'feel anxious and stressed' about returning.</p>

<p>More than 330 schools in England and Wales have either shut completely or sent some class groups home after receiving positive test results. Pictured: Blackfordby St Margaret's CE Primary School, Derbyshire is closed</p>

<p>Jim Blakely, head at Garstang St Thomas' School, told the Today programme: 'At the moment I've got two members of staff not here. </p>

<p>'My Year 4 teacher was sent home last Wednesday due to Covid symptoms, a persistent cough, but there were no tests available on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'So he kept trying to book during the day and in the evening, and there was some test available in some strange places, and these are the same places that parents in my school have been directed to like Aberdeen and Llandudno. Not only are they miles away, but they are in Wales and Scotland. There is very little local testing.'</p>

<p>Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said disruption to pupils' education could worsen in the months to come.</p>

<p>'While only a small number of schools have had to close because of outbreaks, we are regularly hearing reports of groups of pupils and staff having to self-isolate in response to positive cases,' he said. </p>

<p>Downing Street have said that the vast majority - around 99 per cent - of schools have reopened as planned this month.</p>

<p>'There is a very small number of schools which have asked some or all of their pupils to remain at home,' they said. 'Children who are self-isolating continue to receive remote education from home.' </p>

<p>What has gone wrong with coronavirus testing in the UK?</p>

<p>People across England are struggling to get access for swab tests which are used to confirm whether or not they have Covid-19. </p>

<p>These should be available on the day at drive/walk-through centres or by mail order but many have reported being unable to get them, and instead being met by a 'service busy' message on the booking website.</p>

<p>This is even reportedly a problem in areas with local lockdowns, where testing is crucial and mobile test sites are set up to speed up the process.</p>

<p>Why are tests not available for everyone who wants them? </p>

<p>The Government's testing system is still not set up to cope with the surging demand now being placed on it. </p>

<p>It was never advanced enough to offer everyone a test, which is why only people with symptoms are supposed to book the swabs.</p>

<p>Numbers of people catching the virus are rising across the country and the number of people wanting tests is increasing as a result.</p>

<p>Although the Department of Health claims it can process 243,817 swab tests per day, the system is stalling at a lower level – 205,659 were done on Thursday, September 10, the most recent data. </p>

<p>Health officials have blamed laboratory capacity for the shortage, and the testing chief at NHS Test &amp; Trace apologised for this last week.</p>

<p>Is a lack of staff in labs really to blame? </p>

<p>One suggestion is that labs may not have enough technical staff able to operate the machines that process the swabs. </p>

<p>More labs are being set up and more staff employed, but this could take weeks or months to translate to big gains in testing capacity.</p>

<p>One of the scientists who helped set up the system, however, has rejected this and said labs are operating normally and 'there are problems elsewhere in the chain'.</p>

<p>The University of Birmingham's Professor Alan McNally said on BBC Breakfast: 'The labs are still fully staffed, they are still churning through huge amounts of samples per day - the same number as they were a couple of months ago - so there are problems elsewhere in the chain...</p>

<p>'I think this is multi-factorial. I think you almost have a perfect storm of events that have come together to almost essentially crash the testing system.</p>

<p>'I think there is a surge in demand [and] I think our stated capacity is very different from actually how many tests can be run in a given day.'</p>

<p>What is the impact of growing pressure on test labs?</p>

<p>A large workload for testing labs around the UK means that people's results are taking longer to process – many people have to wait more than the target 24 hours to find out their result.</p>

<p>This means that the government is throttling the number of tests that are sent out, to avoid completely overwhelming the system, so people in some areas are finding it difficult to access swabs. </p>

<p>There are concerns that a system that is frustrating or slow to use will put people off and members of the public will stop bothering to use it. </p>

<p>Should people still be ordering tests?</p>

<p>Yes, anyone who has symptoms of coronavirus (a cough, fever or lost sense of taste/smell) must order a test however they can. People who do not have symptoms, and have not been instructed by a medical professional to get tested, should not order a test.</p>
