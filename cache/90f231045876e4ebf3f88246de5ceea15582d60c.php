<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Calls are mounting for action to be taken after a massive crocodile devoured a pet dog before it was spotted close to children.</p>

<p>Cairns lifeguard Bob McPhail said he feared for people's safety after he saw the three-metre crocodile next to the Alamanda Great Barrier Reef Chapel, at Palm Cove, on the weekend.</p>

<p>'It could grab a child any day of the week, and I'm talking about a 13 or 14-year-old, we're here to protect people in the ocean but no one is backing me up,' he told The Courier Mail.</p>

<p>Mr McPhail said a local doctor was walking his Staffordshire bull terrier at about 5.45am on September 23 when he lost site of the dog near the water's edge. </p>

<p>'There was a screeching, a barking, and then gone. The croc is as fat as a pig, it's got a full belly which is obviously the dog,' he said.</p>

<p>A veteran lifeguard said he fears for people's safety after seeing a crocodile (pictured) only metres from children one day after it devoured a local doctor's pet dog</p>

<p>The crocodile has already been reported but Mr McPhail said authorities told him it was within its natural habitat.   </p>

<p>He said it was 'crazy' the animal hadn't been relocated especially because the swim leg of a recent triathlon event was held nearby.</p>

<p>'How do you think I will feel if a five-year-old gets taken this afternoon and I've done nothing?' he said. </p>

<p>A trap was set up in the waterway earlier this year but proved ineffective against the animal.</p>

<p>It's believed the same crocodile attacked a cafe owner's pet Kelpie in April, leaving it with severe gashes, but alive. </p>

<p>Mr McPhail said if the authorities didn't act soon it could 'get someone killed'. </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Department of Environment and Science for comment.   </p>

<p>A trap has been left in the waterway at Palm Cove (pictured) for months but it has proven ineffective against the two to three-metre crocodile</p>
