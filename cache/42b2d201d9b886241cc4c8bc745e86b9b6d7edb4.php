<p>'Due to the production constraints created by the COVID-19 global pandemic, Amazon Studios and Amblin Partners are unable to move forward with production on our Cortés y Moctezuma series,' the companies said in a joint statement.</p>

<p>'In the current climate, there is unfortunately no way to remount the production in the near future to achieve the scale and scope that was intended and that the series deserves,' the statement added. </p>

<p>'We have nothing but admiration and respect for Javier, Tenoch, Yoshira, Gael, Diego, Steve Zaillian, and the entire cast and crew of the series and hope we can work together again in the future,' the statement concluded.</p>

<p>The project originated as a screenplay written by Dalton Trumbo in the 1960s, a decade after he was part of the blacklisted screenwriters known as the Hollywood Ten. </p>

<p>He wrote the project in hopes of reuniting with Kirk Douglas, who hired Trumbo to write Spartacus and thus ending the Hollywood Ten blacklist.</p>

<p>DreamWorks revived the project as a feature film in 2014, said to be a passion project of Steven Spielberg, who was then attached to direct from a new script by Steven Zaillian. </p>

<p>While the project may be revived again in the future, though there are no current plans to utilize the footage that was already shot.</p>

<p>Since the project was shot out of sequence there is no way for the completed footage to be turned into a movie or even a special of some sort.</p>

<p>Bardem will next be seen on the big screen as Stilgar in the highly-anticipated Dune adaptation, and he's also set to play King Triton in The Little Mermaid adaptation. </p>
