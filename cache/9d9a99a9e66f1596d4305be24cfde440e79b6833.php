<p>Dashcam footage shows the motorist driving along a dual carriageway in Gorton, east Manchester, before he stops at a set of traffic lights and begins to inhale the suspected 'hippy crack' from a balloon.</p>

<p>Moments later, his passenger begins to inhale from another balloon before throwing a silver canister out of the window.</p>

<p>Dashcam footage shows the motorist pull up at a set of traffic lights and begin to inhale the suspected nitrous oxide from a balloon in Gorton, east Manchester</p>

<p>The motorist approaches a set of traffic lights and begins to slow down along the dual carriageway</p>

<p>During the clip, which was filmed on September 14, the driver stops at a set of traffic lights and inhales the fumes from the balloon.</p>

<p>His passenger also begins to inhale from a balloon and the pair appear to converse with each other inside the car.</p>

<p>The passenger then throws a silver canister out of the car window and onto the pavement.      </p>

<p>Nitrous oxide, which is also known as 'laughing gas', is a colourless gas, commonly found in pressurised metal canisters, which is usually inhaled by thousands of young Britons in order to achieve feelings of euphoria, relaxation and calmness. </p>

<p>The drug is listed under the 2016 Psychoactive Substances Act, which means it is illegal to give away or sell, and can lead to users falling unconscious or suffocating from a lack of oxygen.</p>

<p>The gas can lead to dizziness, a deficiency of vitamin B12 and anaemia and regular use can stop users from forming white blood cells properly.</p>

<p>Supplying the drug and trying to produce it can lead to up to seven years in prison.</p>

<p>The person sat in the passenger seat also inhales from a balloon and the pair appear to converse with each other</p>

<p>The passenger then appears to throw a silver canister out of the car window and onto the pavement</p>

<p>Driving while under the influence of drugs is illegal and can lead to a minimum one year driving ban, an unlimited fine, up to six months in prison and even a criminal record.</p>

<p>Earlier this year ministers were urged to clamp down on the booming craze after leading pharmacists called for a major tightening of the law. </p>

<p>The authors of the British Medical Journal  article – Royal Pharmaceutical Society chief scientist Luigi Martini, Amira Guirguis of Swansea University Medical School, and Mair Davies, former director for Wales at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society – wrote: 'The frequent presence of silver canisters on our streets – even during the Covid-19 lockdown – is a visible mark of the increasing incidence of nitrous oxide or laughing gas misuse.</p>

<p>'Tighter regulations around the sale of nitrous oxide online need to be imposed.'  </p>
