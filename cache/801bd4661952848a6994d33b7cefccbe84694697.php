<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A thug was caught on camera smacking a man around the head with a pool cue before punching him to the floor in a vicious brawl.</p>

<p>The violent attack was caught on CCTV at the pub on Tuesday evening as other drinkers obliviously carried on their conversations.</p>

<p>The incident was triggered after the victim moved one of the balls on the pool table before the brute launched his assault.</p>

<p>In the clip, two men can be seen leaning over a pool table to pick up their cues as half a dozen other patrons sit at tables around the room.  </p>

<p>One of the men, who is wearing a black Nike sweatshirt, takes his place at the head of the table as he prepares to take his shot.</p>

<p>He appears to ask a third man, who is wearing a black T-shirt, to move out of the way after he started a conversation with his opponent. </p>

<p>But the man in the T-shirt seems to be unhappy at the request and retaliates by throwing the cue ball off the table.</p>

<p>He follows it with tirade of punches which send the victim flying into a table before he tumbles over a stool.</p>

<p>The assailant is held back and leaves the pub as the victim remains lying on the floor. </p>
