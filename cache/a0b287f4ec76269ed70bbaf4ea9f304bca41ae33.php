<p>Doctors at the Royal Free Hospital in London found that too little salt in the body, over a long period of time, weakens the immune system, increasing the risk of infections.</p>

<p>Patients with Gitelman syndrome and Bartter syndrome, which cause an excessive loss of salt through the kidneys, were more likely than others to suffer from recurrent fungal and urinary infections. </p>

<p>The authors of the study, published in the medical journal Nature Communications, explain that a lack of salt halts the production of a type of white blood cell called interleukin 17, which detects and destroys infections.</p>

<p>Holding hands soon after a row could help couples bring a swift end to any disagreement, research suggests.</p>

<p>Partners who held hands and gazed at one another for three minutes after a heated discussion became less stressed, and saw their heart rates return to normal more quickly, the study found. </p>

<p>One theory is that touching hands raises levels of oxytocin, the so-called cuddle hormone, which is linked to happy feelings. </p>

<p>The researchers, from the University of Amsterdam, suggest the technique could prove useful in couples therapy.</p>

<p>Leukaemia warnings we ignore </p>

<p>Half of British adults wouldn’t seek help for telltale signs of blood cancer, according to a survey.</p>

<p>Research by charity Leukaemia Care found that half of participants surveyed would not visit the GP with unusual bruising or bleeding – the most common signs of leukaemia.</p>

<p>The survey of 2,000 people also found three-quarters wouldn’t seek help for other symptoms, such as fevers or night sweats, and two in five wouldn’t speak to a doctor about feeling weak and breathless.</p>

<p>Zack Pemberton-Whiteley, patient advocacy director at Leukaemia Care, said: ‘If anybody is experiencing one or more of these symptoms, it’s always worth contacting a GP and requesting a blood test.’</p>
