<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>There's something regal about arriving at the King’s Head pub with its hefty, iron-studded door and well-worn flagstone floors. Once inside you pass a medieval fireplace that wouldn’t be out of place in a palace.</p>

<p>There’s also the biggest blackboard menu, a 10ft-tall description of award-winning local dishes that’s updated every day.</p>

<p>Pub manager Harry stands behind the brass pumps on a black granite bar and offers a hearty welcome while polishing glasses. Around him sit 19 bottles of gin and half a dozen tonics – 114 cocktail permutations, I’m told.</p>

<p> The King's Head pub in Kettlewell, North Yorkshire, which has a historic feel </p>

<p>But it is a foaming pint of honest Yorkshire beer that really beckons: a Hetton Pale Ale from the Dark Horse Brewery ten miles down the road.</p>

<p>Despite the historic feel of this Yorkshire Dales retreat, the owners Michael and Jenny Pighills have renovated everything since arriving six years ago.</p>

<p>Wooden furnishings have been sanded back to the grain and trimmed with a fresh lick of paint (Farrow &amp; Ball No 82 Dix Blue, in case you wondered). To the rear, a thick-carpeted staircase winds past a library cupboard full of books and DVDs. </p>

<p>Accommodation comprises half a dozen bedrooms spread over two floors, and each named after a monarch. There’s a grand suite to celebrate Charles I and a luxury pad named after King George III.</p>

<p>The top floor, King Edward VII, is where I stayed. It’s a comfy, twin-room with lots of stylish touches and an ensuite complete with Duck Island toiletries.</p>

<p>Tea-making facilities sit alongside a plate of shortbread biscuits from the pub chef. Look out the bedroom window and there is a view of Upper Wharfedale. </p>

<p>Regal touch: The pub has half a dozen bedrooms spread over two floors, and each named after a monarch</p>

<p>The King’s Head, Kettlewell, North Yorkshire. </p>

<p>B&amp;B doubles from £80 a night. For more information visit  thekingsheadkettlewell.co.uk.</p>

<p>The village sits where the River Wharfe and Kettlewell Beck meet and is a mix of limestone bridges and cottages. It was the setting for the 2003 film Calendar Girls, starring Helen Mirren and Julie Walters.</p>

<p>Good walks abound and I started with a two-mile meander along sheep trails to the neighbouring village of Starbotton.</p>

<p>For something more invigorating, there’s a five-mile hike west over a 1,500ft limestone ridge to Arncliffe, a village with its own claim to fame as the fictional Beckindale in early episodes of TV soap Emmerdale.</p>

<p>After all this exercise, you are in for a treat back at the pub’s restaurant. Chicken Wensleydale – poultry stuffed with cheese and apricot and wrapped in pancetta – was the star of the show.</p>

<p>The USP: It sounds regal but it’s really relaxed with surroundings so beautiful it’s no surprise they’ve been in the movies.</p>

<p>The rooms: Thoughtfully designed, mixing modern appeal with a touch of class so they suit blue-bloods and commoners alike.</p>

<p>The food: It’s easy to see why the kitchens have earned an AA Rosette for culinary excellence. I long for another portion of that chicken breast with Wensleydale cheese. Cracking, Gromit. </p>
