<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Karl Stefanovic may have recently signed a new contract with Channel Nine. </p>

<p>But his co-host Ally Langdon has playfully suggested the veteran presenter, 46, should start to consider his retirement plan.  </p>

<p>On Tuesday, 41-year-old Ally couldn't resist taking a jab at Karl's age following a segment about elderly people continuing to work throughout their sunset years.   </p>

<p>'You're not far from 50,' Ally told Karl during the frosty on-air exchange.  </p>

<p>Taken aback by the brazen statement, Karl responded: 'You want to get me out the door now? I can go now if you like.' </p>

<p>Giggling, Ally assured him: 'I am happy for you to stay until you're 50.'  </p>

<p>'You're not far from 50': Today's Ally Langdon, 41 (left), took a jab at Karl Stefanovic's age on Tuesday, suggesting the 46-year-old (left) should consider his retirement plan </p>

<p>This only made things more awkward, as an offended Karl hit back: 'That's only a couple of years... Ok, no problems. Nice to be welcomed.'  </p>

<p>'No! I'm just saying it's nice to know you've got options!' Ally chuckled.  </p>

<p>Karl appeared momentarily gobsmacked as crew members could be heard laughing in the background.  </p>

<p>Roasted: Taken aback by the brazen statement, Karl responded: 'You want to get me out the door now? I can go now if you like'</p>

<p>The playful sledging continued when Karl accused Ally of 'waking up funny this morning'. </p>

<p>'I just think you're being very sensitive this morning!' teased the blonde.  </p>

<p>Karl then attempted to recruit sports presenter Alex Cullen to back up him up, but the 39-year-old made it clear he wasn't interested in confrontation.  </p>

<p>'Totes awks': Karl appeared momentarily gobsmacked as crew members could be heard laughing in the background </p>

<p>'Alex, how have you found it?' probed Karl, prompting the reporter to turn away and pick up his mobile phone. </p>

<p>'I tend to agree. I will be on my phone now...' he muttered, staring down at the screen. </p>

<p>'It's been a little by awks. Totes awks,' Karl concluded, shuffling his papers. </p>

<p>The term 'totes awks' is a phrase mostly used by millennials (people aged between 24 to 39) meaning 'totally awkward'. </p>

<p>He's not going anywhere... for now! Karl signed a new contract with Channel Nine on Saturday, with reports claiming he is set to remain at the network until at least 2023</p>
