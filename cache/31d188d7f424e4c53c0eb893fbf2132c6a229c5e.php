<p>When the tension mounted during the quiz's end Marrow frequently swept her brunette locks from her face - but some viewers said they found the hair-swishing irritating </p>

<p>Competition-wise, it was a relative stroll in the park for Marrow and her team, who conquered the Royal Academy of Music's team by 220 to 40.  </p>

<p>Much of the Twitter reaction to the show though focused on Marrow's hair-twiddling.   </p>

<p>Others though were smitten by Marrow's impressive intellect. <?php echo e('@'); ?>carolinerijkse asked: 'Rebecca Marrow from St. John’s on #UniversityChallenge May I have your hand in marriage?'</p>

<p>The show has already seen an impressive roster of characters this series with Seoan Webb, who's studying Ancient and Modern History at Oxford's Corpus Christi College, tipped to be the stand-out star. </p>

<p>Last month, Webb's 'thousand-yard stare' left viewers cold - and impressed - with his 'merciless' intellect as he gained most of his team's points after they conquered Bristol University 175 to 135. </p>

<p>Don't mess! Oxford student Seoan Webb blew the competition out of the water in the latest episode of University Challenge, which saw his team defeat Bristol 175 to 135</p>

<p>Taking to Twitter, fans of the show hailed the 19-year-old as the 'stand-out' superbrain of the series - despite it only being the second round of the student quiz. </p>

<p>After some commented on his awkward body language and deeply intense stare, one of his former teachers, from Elthorne High School in Ealing, West London, asked viewers to 'be kind', saying her former student was a 'phenomenon'. </p>

<p>Webb gained 10 A* at GCSE at the state school comprehensive in 2017.</p>

<p>Despite his steely demeanour on the show, she added that he was 'the loveliest kid'.</p>

<p>London teacher <?php echo e('@'); ?>NikkiCDaniel wrote: 'Seoan Webb is a phenomenon. The brightest person both Mark and I have ever taught and the loveliest kid. He is the real deal. Please twitter, be nice. Good luck #CorpusChristi'</p>

<p>The school's library also tweeted, saying they were 'proud' of their former student. </p>
