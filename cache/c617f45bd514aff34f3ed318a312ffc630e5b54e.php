<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A flat-earther couple who tried to 'sail to the edge of the world' during lockdown had to be rescued by a maritime doctor who usually saves migrants.</p>

<p>The pair, from Venice, attempted to travel to Lampedusa, an island between Sicily and North Africa which has become a prime transit point for migrants wanting to enter Europe.</p>

<p>The conspiracy theorists believed the edge of the world fell near the island and they wanted to see it.</p>

<p>A flat-earther couple who tried to 'sail to the edge of the world' during lockdown had to be rescued by a maritime doctor who usually saves migrants</p>

<p>They sold their car to buy the boat in Termini Imerese, a town in northern Sicily, before they set off on their journey.</p>

<p>But the couple surprisingly never made it to the end of the world, nor even Lampedusa, instead getting lost near the island of Ustica, off the north coast of Sicily.</p>

<p>Salvatore Zichichi, a doctor of the maritime health office of the Ministry of Health, helped the pair after they got lost. </p>

<p>He told Italian news outlet La Stampa that he pointed out the irony of the couple using a compass in their unsuccessful navigation.</p>

<p>He said: 'The funny thing is that they orient themselves with the compass, an instrument that works on the basis of terrestrial magnetism</p>

<p>The pair, from Venice, attempted to travel to Lampedusa (pictured), an island between Sicily and North Africa</p>

<p>'A principle that they, as Flat Earthers, should reject.' </p>

<p>As they broke lockdown restrictions, they were taken into quarantine in Palermo for two weeks.</p>

<p>But they tried to escape, only for the port authority to stop them three hours later and bring them back into quarantine.</p>

<p>They tried to escape again, and were caught again, and finally decided to see out the two weeks of isolation.</p>

<p>They have since abandoned their quest and took a ferry back to mainland Italy.    </p>
