<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bury Town were left 'appalled' after their 5-0 lead over Witham Town was erased when the referee abandoned the match with just minutes remaining due to fog.</p>

<p>The non-league club were cruising to a resounding victory after Jake Chambers Shaw scored a hat-trick and set up the other two goals for Cemal Ramadan and Ollie Hughes.</p>

<p>But it was the opposition players smiling as they left the pitch with the referee refusing to wait to see if the fog cleared as a crowd of 400 supporters were sent home.</p>

<p>Bury Town were leading Witham Town 5-0 when the game was abandoned because of fog</p>

<p>Conditions had been foggy throughout the second half but had not appeared to deteriorate, with both goals still visible from the sidelines. </p>

<p>The Isthmian League North side issued a damning statement on their website which expressed their disgust at the controversial decision. </p>

<p>The club wrote: 'Bury Town Football Club were appalled that Tuesday evening's home Isthmian League match with Witham Town was abandoned by the match referee with just 7 minutes remaining due to fog.</p>

<p>'With the scoreline 5-0 in favour of Bury Town and 83 minutes played, with no prior warning the referee abandoned the game with no attempt to find a solution to play the remaining 7 minutes.</p>

<p>Both goals were visible when the referee made the controversial decision in the 83rd minute</p>

<p>'At the point the game was abandoned, there was clear visibility across the pitch. There was no consideration for the 400 capacity crowd in attendance or the club staff who had successfully staged another sell out fixture.</p>

<p>'The Club would like to apologise to our supporters for a decision that was out of our control, but we thank you for your continued support.</p>

<p>'The Club has already been in contact with the Isthmian League regarding the final outcome of the match.'</p>

<p>Bury's manager Ben Chenery was understandably livid and slammed the official for his handling of the situation. </p>

<p>He told East Anglican Times: 'It was a crazy and a naive – whatever you'd like to call it – decision by the referee.</p>

<p>'The referee has to be accountable. We are in the middle of a pandemic, and we're not replaying this match because we can't fit another one in!</p>

<p>Bury's manager Ben Chenery slammed the 'crazy and naive' decision of the match official</p>

<p>'The club are working so hard to get these games on, and to get these people in, and we are 5-0 up with just seven minutes remaining!</p>

<p>'We are about to win a league game when the referee decides to call off the match when the fog was no worse than it had been throughout the whole game.</p>

<p>'To be honest, the referee did not know what he was doing. I asked the referee when we went in 'can we give it 10 or 15 minutes and bring them (the players) back out?'  but he said 'no, I have made my decision.''</p>

<p>There was more anger after the abandonment brought smiles from the Witham players and Chenery alleged they had been attempting to get the game abandoned throughout - despite the emphatic scoreline.</p>

<p>'There was only seven minutes left, we needed to be sensible. The game was done, and yet Witham players were trying to get the game called off,' he said.</p>

<p>'We have worked so hard to win games. The effort my management team and players have put in to get results like this is immense, and yet we have people who are not up to the job. The fog did not get much worse in the second half. I'm lost for words.</p>

<p>'It looked to me like the referee was out of his depth when he made that call. He didn't take control of the situation and say that we will walk off for 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p>'There were no need for that decision to be made, and I call on the FA to have some bravery, because this result has to stand.</p>

<p>'We can't do this again. Why should we have another football match when the chairman and board have worked so hard to put this on.</p>

<p>'We sold fully out and it's a sickening blow, after what was such an entertaining game of football.' </p>

<p>FA guidance on a possible abandonment because of fog states: 'If possible, players should be taken off the field of play until such time a final decision is made as to whether to continue or abandon.'</p>

<p>Bury will now await a decision from the Isthmian League as to whether the result will stand but the club are back in action on Saturday as they take on Waltham Abbey in the second qualifying round of the FA Cup.</p>
