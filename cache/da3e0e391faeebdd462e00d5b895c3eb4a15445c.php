<p>The neon sign at Sydney's Paddington Markets depicted three fish swimming towards a fishing hook with the slogan emblazoned beside it. </p>

<p>The man who posted the image online said the sign was 'awful' and that it flew in the face of the 'sealife not seafood' motto.</p>

<p>Vegans slammed Sydney's Paddington Markets after a sign saying 'fish are food, not friends' was pictured inside the building and posted online (pictured)</p>

<p>A large number of other vegans echoed the man's sentiments. </p>

<p>'This is disgusting. Would be such a shame if someone came along and smashed the sign,' one wrote on social media, Yahoo News reported. </p>

<p>'Anything to stay afloat. When these industries feel threatened, they try so hard to stay relevant,' another added. </p>

<p>Plant eaters appeared to take exception to the sign, which was seemingly a play on a popular vegan term, 'friends not food'. </p>

<p>The sign was located in the main hall of the market so the man said he couldn't attribute it to any one business.  </p>
