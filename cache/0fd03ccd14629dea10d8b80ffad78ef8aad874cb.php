<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Queen was crippled by obsessive compulsive disorder as a child and used to line up her pencils in perfectly straight lines to feel 'safe,' a new book has claimed.</p>

<p>A new book titled The Governess, released last month, has made the extraordinary claim about Britain's longest reigning monarch, 94.</p>

<p>The book, listed as 'historical and biographical fiction,' on Amazon and Google Books, tells the story of Marion Crawford, who was Her Majesty's teacher when she was a young princess.</p>

<p>The Governess claims a young Princess Elizabeth, pictured in 1940, showed signs of obsessive compulsive disorder, straightening up pencils and plates in order to feel 'safe'  </p>

<p>An extract of the book shared by The Sun, reveals how Queen Elizabeth II would straighten up pencils and plates compulsively as a child. </p>

<p>Wendy Holden's book reads: 'Marion, whose training encompassed child psychology, now realised she was looking at obsessive compulsion.'</p>

<p>Challenged on why she aligned the items, Crawford wrote that the young Elizabeth replied: 'Because it makes me feel safe' </p>

<p>The book claims Marion never received an answer from Queen Elizabeth II, as her mother walked in at that very moment</p>

<p>'"Safe?" echoed Marion. "Safe from what?"'</p>

<p>The book claims Marion never received an answer from the monarch-in-waiting, as the Queen's mother walked in at that very moment. </p>

<p>Obsessive compulsive disorder, usually known as OCD, is a common mental health condition which makes people obsess over thoughts and develop behaviour they struggle to control.</p>

<p>It can cause people to suffer with unpleasant, intrusive thoughts and they will often act on behaviours as a means of controlling the thoughts.</p>

<p>The Governess by Wendy Holden was released last month.  </p>

<p>Obsessive compulsive disorder, usually known as OCD, is a common mental health condition which makes people obsess over thoughts and develop behaviour they struggle to control.</p>

<p>It can affect anyone at any age but normally develops during young adulthood.</p>

<p>It can cause people to have repetitive unwanted or unpleasant thoughts.</p>

<p>People may also develop compulsive behaviour – a physical action or something mental – which they do over and over to try to relieve the obsessive thoughts.</p>

<p>The condition can be controlled and treatment usually involves psychological therapy or medication.  </p>

<p>It is not known why OCD occurs but risk factors include a family history of the condition, certain differences in brain chemicals, or big life events like childbirth or bereavement. </p>

<p>People who are naturally tidy, methodical or anxious are also more likely to develop it.</p>
