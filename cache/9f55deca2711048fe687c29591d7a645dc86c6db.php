<p>'The fire alarm sensor was going off at like 4:30 in the morning. The dogs were up barking. Everybody was up, and it was such a fun night. And now I'm so tired, I'm so excited it's Friday. And yeah, I'm just looking forward to a chill weekend.'</p>

<p>She also posted a photo to her profile in a white crop top and matching high-waisted trousers, promoting a post on her blog Frenshe, in which she opens up about her recent breast explant surgery.  </p>

<p>Tisdale revealed that she suffered from 'some gut issues and food sensitivities' before discovering a woman on Instagram who had the same symptoms, which were attributed to Breast Implant Illness.  </p>

<p>She wrote about her recovery: 'Seeing my body in a way I hadn’t seen it in a while and fully loving the way I looked is a feeling I’ll never forget. Am I bummed I have scars from getting implants and regret getting them in the first place? Of course. </p>

<p>'However, my husband always helps me look at the positive and says that those scars represent my journey and what got me to where I am right now. So, I embrace those imperfections, and I embrace that I’m not perfect and that I’m beautiful just as I am.' </p>

<p>'For YEARS it has been the question from everyone since I got married. At first, I rebelled against it, and like clockwork, after I got engaged EVERYONE (and I mean everyone!) asked when I was getting married. Then, once I was married, everyone was asking when I was having kids. </p>

<p>'To be honest, it just felt invasive. I wasn’t ready for that step yet and I wanted to be selfish and have Chris all to myself for a while. Honestly, I wouldn’t have had it any other way.'</p>
