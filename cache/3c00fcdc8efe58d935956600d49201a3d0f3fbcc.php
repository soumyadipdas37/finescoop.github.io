<p>Galore, a novel by Canadian author Michael Crummey. </p>

<p>He's boundlessly inventive in his creation of wholly distinctive worlds for his characters — in this case, the remoter parts of the island of Newfoundland, among characters whose lives are dominated by the folkloric tales they live within and pass along. </p>

<p>Among other things, it's very funny.</p>

<p>Sue Miller is currently reading Galore, a novel by Canadian Michael Crummey</p>

<p>. . . would you take to a desert island?</p>

<p>It would have to be a book I'd read before — imagine launching yourself into the one that had to last you for perhaps the rest of your life then discovering you hated it. </p>

<p>I'd also need multiple plotlines and rich worlds to explore. War And Peace? Why not?</p>

<p>. . . first gave you the reading bug?</p>

<p>Jane Eyre when I was 12. I took it down from my parents' bookshelf at random. From the first sentence, I was lost in it. </p>

<p>Charlotte Brontë has much to answer for by proposing the outwardly cruel, inwardly sensitive and passionate model of what a man should be.</p>

<p>But Jane's slow making of a self out of the most unlikely materials is wonderful.</p>

<p>. . . left you cold?</p>

<p>Wuthering Heights. Emily Brontë is considered by some to be a truer poet than Charlotte; but somehow the book seems nearly parodic in its intensity. </p>

<p>Like a grotesque version of her sister's work. Unfair, no doubt.</p>

<p>Monogamy by Sue Miller is out now (Bloomsbury, £16.99).</p>
