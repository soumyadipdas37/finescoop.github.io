<p>The star producer was just one of a litany of on- and off-air talent booted from the network as media revenues collapsed in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>Head of comedy Paul Leadon was axed along with the boss of sport Matt White. </p>

<p>Popular presenters Kerri-Anne Kennerley, Tim Bailey and Natasha Belling were also given the chop.</p>

<p>In total, about 30 staff were axed from the network's TV operations.</p>

<p>Before that, the entire news and lifestyle website 10 Daily was also scrapped in May.</p>

<p>Despite the timing, Ten's new boss Beverley McGarvey who took over as CEO in March, said the cuts are not linked the coronavirus crisis. </p>

<p>'The recent impact of COVID-19 on the media industry has reinforced the need to continue to align our business with our evolving customer needs and global business model, but I want to stress that the changes are part of our broader strategy, not a reaction to recent events,' McGarvey said in an email to staff. </p>
