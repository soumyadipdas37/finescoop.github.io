<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Paulina Porizkova shared a thinly-veiled revelation about her relationship with late husband Ric Ocasek - hinting that The Cars frontman cheated on his second wife while embarking on a relationship with the supermodel. </p>

<p>The 55-year-old mother-of-two shared a throwback photo of herself with Ric, who passed away last September at the age of 75, on the set of the music video where they first met - and in the caption she revealed that she has come to learn their 'love started with a betrayal of his then-wife'. </p>

<p>'I now realize our love started with a betrayal (of his then-wife) and ended with betrayal,' Paulina wrote alongside the photo, referring not only to the first days of their relationship, but also to the final days, when Ric wrote his then-estranged wife out of his will, while accusing her of 'abandoning him'.  </p>

<p>Opening up: The 55-year-old supermodel hinted that Ric cheated on his second wife Suzanne, who he divorced in 1988, when embarking on his romance with Paulina, who he met in 1884</p>

<p>The image shared by Paulina shows the model posing alongside Ric and director Timothy Hutton on the set of the music video for Cars' hit Drive in 1984, which is where the model and her late husband first met. </p>

<p>At the time, Ric was married to his second wife Suzanne Ocasek, with whom he tied the knot in 1971. The pair divorced in 1988, four years after Ric met a then-18-year-old Paulina, and just one year before he wed the model. </p>

<p>Although it has previously been suggested that Ric's romance with Paulina overlapped his marriage to Suzanne, neither he nor his wives have ever publicly commented on it - until now. </p>

<p>Ric and Paulina, who had two sons together, were married for three decades, before they quietly separated in 2017 - however they had not yet finalized their divorce when he passed away in their Manhattan townhouse on September 15, 2019. </p>

<p>But in her latest Instagram post, Paulina refers to their 35-year-long romance, suggesting that they started their relationship almost immediately after they met on the set of the Cars music video. </p>

<p>'In the thirty-five years we spent together, most of the years were good,' she continued. 'That is what I am trying to learn to remember.'</p>

<p>In the last year, Paulina has been incredibly candid about her struggle to deal with her grief over Ric's passing - as well as her feelings of 'hurt and betrayal' over his decision to cut her out of his will in the wake of their separation. </p>

<p>During an appearance on CBS This Morning in February - her first interview since her estranged husband's passing - Paulina opened up about her conflicting feelings for Ric, admitting that she was devastated by his decision to cut her out of his will because he felt she had 'abandoned him'. </p>

<p>The couple was separated and going through a divorce when he died, however because they were not legally divorced, Paulina, as his widow, may be entitled under New York law to an 'elective share' of his estate.</p>

<p>Ric specifically addressed the rule in his will, stating: 'Even if I should die before our divorce is final… Paulina is not entitled to any elective share… because she has abandoned me. </p>

<p>Details: In her post, Paulina - who is pictured with Ric in 1990, one year after they married - referred to the couple's '35-year' romance, suggesting they got together just after meeting</p>

<p>Controversy: At the time Ric (pictured with Paulina in 2018), who passed away in September 2019, was still married to Suzanne - however the couple divorced in 1988 </p>

<p>Family: Ric and Paulina, who had two sons during their marriage, quietly separated in 2017, however they had not yet finalized their divorce when he passed away  </p>

<p>However, unless it can be proven in court that she did abandon him, she will likely be entitled to a one-third share of the musician's assets, which are listed as $5 million in 'copyrights', $100,000 in 'tangible personal property,' and $15,000 in cash.</p>

<p>During her televised sit-down, Paulina confessed that the instruction had left her devastated, saying: 'I would love to be able to be sad and miss him, and not also feel this incredible hurt and betrayal.'  </p>

<p>Over the past year, the model has continued to open up about her very personal grieving process, and earlier this week, she shared a heartbreaking image of herself packing up some of Ric's belongings, while detailing the hurt she felt at having to 'let go of everything I’ve known'.</p>

<p>'Beginning the process of letting go of things - letting go of thirty years - letting go of everything I’ve known - everything that made me feel safe,' she captioned the photo, which shows her kneeling on the ground, with a blanket clasped in her arms and her face in the fabric. </p>

<p>She continued: 'Today is not good day. But I know I have to keep moving. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.'  </p>

<p>Emotional: On Tuesday, mother-of-two Paulina shared a heartbreaking photo of herself packing up Ric's belongings</p>

<p>Candid: Alongside the image, the supermodel opened up about her ongoing grief, writing that she was 'beginning the process of letting go of things'</p>

<p>Paulina was inundated with messages of support and sympathy - something that she addressed her latest post, thanking her friends and followers, while sharing an update on her state of mind. </p>

<p>'Thank you all so very much for your messages; I do read every single one,' she said. </p>

<p>'I’m in a time of extreme upheaval - and like many of you have pointed out - the only way out is through. But this weekend, I’m with loved ones and I will put things aside for a moment to enjoy and celebrate life and love.' </p>

<p>The post comes less than before the anniversary of Ocasek's death; he passed away while recovering from a surgery, and it was Paulina who found his body in their Manhattan townhouse. </p>

<p>A New York City medical examiner later determined that he died from hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with pulmonary emphysema being a contributing factor.   </p>
