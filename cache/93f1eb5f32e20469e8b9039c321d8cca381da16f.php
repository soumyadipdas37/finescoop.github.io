<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A two-day-old girl has been stabbed 100 times with a screwdriver and her body dumped at a temple amid a spate of newborn girl murders in an Indian city.</p>

<p>Police were called early on Thursday morning to reports that a baby wrapped in a blanket was lying next to the temple in Bhopal.</p>

<p>It was first thought that the girl had been savaged by animal before an autopsy revealed that her wounds were inflicted by a screwdriver.</p>

<p>Ayodhya Nagar police station said that it was scouring CCTV images of the area to track the perpetrator.</p>

<p>Officers believe the baby was born at home before the shocking murder.</p>

<p>In the last two weeks another two girls have been killed in the city. The newborns were murdered by their mothers.</p>

<p>Female infanticide in India is believed to be an under-reported phenomenon.</p>

<p>However, the male-female birth ratio – that is the ratio of boys to girls at younger age groups – is used to support this claim.</p>

<p>The natural ratio is usually said to be 106, with a range of between 103 and 107. Any number higher than 107 suggests that infanticide or abortions have skewed the proportion of males in a population.</p>

<p>In India, the ratio for babies is estimated to be at 1.11.</p>

<p>By comparison, in the United Kingdom and the United States the figure is 1.05, according to data from the CIA.</p>
