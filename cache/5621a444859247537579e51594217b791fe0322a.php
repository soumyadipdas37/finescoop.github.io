<p>'My favourite new accessory': Lily Collins took to Instagram to flaunt her rose-cut diamond engagement ring in a radiant snap on Tuesday</p>

<p>Cutting a chic figure, the Les Misérables star was dressed in a black cold-shoulder top as she posed by a floral print wall.</p>

<p>The thespian held onto her the strands of her lightly-curled tresses to show off her stunning item of jewellery. </p>

<p>On Lily's striking ring, gemstone experts The Natural Diamond Council told MailOnline: 'Rose cut diamonds look like a flower—in fact, the cut resembles a spiral of petals in a rose bud. This diamond shape comes in two forms: single rose cut and a rose cut with additional layers of diamond facets. </p>

<p>'The rose cut is a fantastic option if you want more for your money: It’s a great alternative to the popular round cut. Even better, they tend to have more spread, which means more of the carat weight faces up, making the diamonds appear larger than a brilliant cut of the same carat weight.</p>

<p>'One of the appeals of rose cut diamonds is that they get very close to your skin. Rose cut diamonds are very sensual and tactile, more intimate.' </p>

<p>The LA native has dated several high-profile actresses, including Emilia Clarke, 33, Hilary Duff, 32, and Rooney Mara, 35.</p>
