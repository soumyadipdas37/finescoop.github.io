<p>Former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi (pictured in 2019) was admitted to hospital for coronavirus on Friday morning. He said during a phone call last night that doctors said his viral load was worse than thousands of others tested at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan </p>

<p>On Wednesday, his personal doctor Alberto Zangrillo said Berlusconi's progress was 'favourable' and all his clinical parameters were 'very comforting.' </p>

<p>Zangrillo has said he is responding well to treatment but has noted that Berlusconi's age and condition - he has a pacemaker - make him at higher risk of complications. </p>
