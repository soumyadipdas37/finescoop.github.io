<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The 'delighted' Queen has today congratulated Meghan Markle and Prince Harry as they announced they are expecting their first royal baby - conceived just ten weeks after they married.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan told Her Majesty she would be having her eighth great-grandchild next spring during Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle on Friday. </p>

<p>Today the couple were seen beaming as they touched down in Sydney to start their three-week tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga - their first major international trip since they married in May.</p>

<p>They were later photographed holding hands in the grounds of Admiralty House, where the Queen stays Down Under, when their happy news was announced to the world.</p>

<p>Harry today gave his first TV interview since the news went public with ABC's Australian Story, but could not be tempted to disclose any new details. </p>

<p>Instead, he focused on the importance of the Invictus Games, which starts in Sydney next week. </p>

<p>Meghan, 37, is in 'good health' and has had a successful 12 week scan - meaning the child was conceived between their mid-July tour of Ireland and her birthday on August 4, when Prince Harry was best man at the wedding of Charlie van Straubenzee.</p>

<p>The royal baby is due in late April 2019, possibly around St George's Day, April 23, meaning the child, who will be seventh in line to the throne behind Harry, could share a birthday with its cousin Prince Louis.</p>

<p>Announcing their baby news Kensington Palace said today: 'Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019. Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public'.</p>

<p>The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have said they are 'delighted' to be welcoming their eighth great-grandchild in a joint statement with Prince Charles, who will have four grandchildren when baby Sussex is born next year. Prince William and his wife Kate also hailed his brother and sister-in-law's good news.  </p>

<p>Meghan Markle laughs and says hello as the royal couple got off a plane in Sydney today for their first major royal tour since they got married - and announced they are having their first baby hours later</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were spotted hand in hand wandering the grounds of Sydney's Admiralty House as the world was told their good news</p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex, 37, was holding hands with her husband, 34, was dressed casually for the occasion as she donned a black turtle-neck top, with a dark-coloured blazer she wore last week</p>

<p>Meghan Markle was carrying two purple folders as she stepped off the plane and used they to cover her stomach, which led to rumours that she was carrying a baby</p>

<p>The baby news was released in a statement by Kensington Palace this morning (pictured) and the baby is due in Spring 2019</p>

<p>The news was also tweeted by the couple's official account (pictured) sending social media into a frenzy at 8.40am UK time</p>

<p>Last month Meghan's mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, and could now move to London permanently to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will still visit Tonga and Fiji during their 16-day royal tour despite fears over the Zika virus, it was confirmed today.</p>

<p>It goes against travel advice that pregnant women should consider not travelling to the countries because of the 'moderate risk' of catching the tropical disease.</p>

<p>But Kensington Palace said the couple had sought medical advice and decided to continue with their plans, with no change expected to their itinerary.</p>

<p>Zika can endanger unborn babies, with pregnant women being advised to avoid all travel to areas where cases of the mosquito-borne virus have been reported.</p>

<p>The virus - which had an outbreak in Brazil in 2016 - can cause microcephaly for children in the womb, causing babies to be born with abnormally small skulls.</p>

<p>For Fiji and Tonga, the National Travel Health Network and Centre advises pregnant women to 'consider postponing non-essential travel until after the pregnancy'.</p>

<p>Official advice from the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office also tells couples visiting Zika areas to use condoms for sex to prevent transmission of the virus.</p>

<p>Couples should also follow guidance on avoiding transmitting Zika through other forms of sexual contact - and avoid conception while travelling and for up to six months on return.</p>

<p>The NHS advises tourists to Fiji and Tonga to take steps to avoid mosquito bites, ensure they have adequate insurance and seek health advice before travelling.</p>

<p>These facts had previously led some sources to believe that Meghan might have pulled out of the trip if she fell pregnant. </p>

<p>But a royal source told the Daily Mirror: 'The Duke and Duchess will have taken advice at the highest level. Every precaution will be taken. The royal couple's health is naturally of the utmost importance.'</p>

<p>Ms Ragland today issued a statement saying she was 'very happy at this lovely news and is looking forward to welcoming her first grandchild'.</p>

<p>But Harry and Meghan are unlikely to have told her estranged father Thomas Markle in advance because of the rift over his failure to walk her down the aisle.</p>

<p>Today Meghan and Harry landed in Australia on a normal commercial Qantas passenger flight and chose an Airbus A380.</p>

<p>It has a higher cabin pressure and half the cabin noise of other aircraft to ensure a more restful journey for the newly-pregnant Duchess.</p>

<p>And rumours she is carrying a baby went into overdrive as soon as the former actress got off the plane in Sydney because she kept touching her stomach and later covered her midriff with a folder.</p>

<p>On Friday Meghan also wore a suspiciously wide-fitting Givenchy coat to Princess Eugenie's wedding in Windsor with husband Harry spotted repeatedly rubbing her lower back. </p>

<p>The new royal baby is expected to take the surname Sussex in the same way that Prince William's children, George, Charlotte and Louis have taken his title Cambridge as their last name at school and nursery. </p>

<p>But the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby will not be a prince nor a princess unless the Queen steps in.</p>

<p>Social media exploded as the news was announced at 8.40am UK time and some have named the child a 'Brexit Baby' - because it will be born shortly after Britain leaves the EU on March 29.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's baby will have a host of American relatives he or she is unlikely to see much of, if at all, because of a series of public rows.</p>

<p>While Meghan is close to her mother Doria Ragland, the remainder of her family did not attend her star-studded royal wedding five months ago.</p>

<p>And the Markles have slung a barrage of insults at Meghan and the Windsors after being supposedly cut out of the Duchess's life. </p>

<p>Her father Thomas Markle pulled out of walking his daughter down the aisle at the last minute after being caught posing for staged paparazzi photographs and reportedly falling ill.</p>

<p>He went on to sell his story to the press, appearing on Good Morning Britain to reveal how Meghan, whom he calls by the nickname Bean, cried when he said he could not attend her big day.</p>

<p>He also indiscreetly shared conversations he had with Harry about Donald Trump and Brexit, and said he expected Harry and Meghan to have children soon.</p>

<p>Mr Markle, who has yet to meet Harry face to face, complained Meghan had cut him off and not contacted him since the wedding.</p>

<p>He declared how it might be easier for his daughter if he died, and said he put the phone down on Harry after a heated discussion and likened the royal family to a 'cult'.</p>

<p>Unless Doria Ragland has told him their daughter is pregnant it appears very unlikely that Harry and Meghan will have done so.  </p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex was glowing as she stepped-in to a car at Sydney airport, which took the couple to Admiralty House, the Governor-General's Sydney residence, where the pair will spend the night</p>

<p>As Meghan stepped-in to her awaiting car, she found time to wave to the crowd which had gathered to welcome the Royal couple to Australia but the folders remained covering her midriff</p>

<p>Meghan was all smiles as she touched down on Australian soil for the first time, having flown in from London via Singapore overnight on a commercial Qantas flight</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan attended the wedding of his cousin Princess Eugenie on Friday in Windsor (pictured) - where they told the Queen and the royal family they were expecting and she was wearing a wide fitting coat</p>

<p>The Queen beamed with joy after seeing her granddaughter Eugenie marry at Windsor on Friday - and later that day Meghan and Harry told Her Majesy they were expecting their first baby</p>

<p>Baby Sussex would become seventh in line to the throne but very unlikely to become monarch</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex 's child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne.</p>

<p>The child will come behind his or her father Prince Harry in the line of succession, bumping his uncle, the Duke of York, further down the line into eighth place.</p>

<p>However the child will not be given the title of prince or princess unless the Queen steps into change the rules. Instead a son would be styled the Earl of Dumbarton, while a daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>Kensington Palace announced today the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with her first child. The baby is expected in Spring next year.</p>

<p>The baby will bump Harry's uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession.</p>

<p>Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queen's youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time to 11th in line.</p>

<p>Today Meghan and Harry started a 16-day tour of Australasia.</p>

<p>But their trip to Fiji and Tonga next week will go ahead despite advice that pregnant women should not travel to the region because of its moderate Zika risk.</p>

<p>The couple said today they had sought medical and advice and decided to go ahead with their plans.  </p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex is believed to have become pregnant around ten weeks after they married at Windsor Castle in May and on or just after their trip to Ireland in July.</p>

<p>Meghan is believed to have had her 12-week scan last week, meaning the couple went on a two-day visit across the Irish Sea around the time they were trying for a baby.</p>

<p>In one extraordinary exchange in Dublin, Harry was asked about it directly as he met people in the city.</p>

<p>One woman was heard asking him: 'My husband also has red hair and he gave me five children - when are you and Meghan going to get going?' - Harry laughed and replied: 'Five children? Too many'.</p>

<p>Both Harry and Meghan have spoken openly about wanting to start a family.</p>

<p>The topic cropped up in their engagement interview, with Harry, saying: 'Hopefully we'll start a family in the near future.'</p>

<p>The pair are also known for their warm, caring approach when meeting youngsters on official visits.</p>

<p>Even the duchess's father Thomas Markle, whom she is believed not to have spoken to since her wedding, said he expected children soon.</p>

<p>Mr Markle is not believed to have been told the news in advance of today's announcement.</p>

<p>He told ITV's Good Morning Britain in an interview a month after the duke and duchess married: 'She's wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there's got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.'</p>

<p>Announcing their baby news Kensington Palace said today: 'Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019. Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public'.</p>

<p>Meghan and Harry are embarking on their first proper royal tour together.</p>

<p>They were spotted walking hand in hand enjoying the grounds of Sydney's Admiralty House - just after announcing their pregnancy.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle traveled straight to Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove's sprawling harbourside residence in Kirribilli after touching down at Sydney's airport. </p>

<p>Despite the long-haul flight from the UK, the Royal couple had beaming smiles when they disembarked the A380 aircraft in Sydney today</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex (pictured in Sydney today) will have a low-key start to their tour, with official duties not starting until Tuesday and centred around Sydney</p>

<p>Prince Harry gives a wave as he is whisked through Sydney on Monday morning to start his 16-day tour of Australia and the South Pacific </p>

<p>A beaming Meghan Markle (pictured centre) is pictured arriving in Australia for the first time. Her husband Harry was last in the country in June 2017</p>

<p>Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was 'very happy about this lovely news' and 'looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild'</p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex's mother has expressed her joy at the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.</p>

<p>Doria Ragland said she was 'very happy about this lovely news' and 'looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild'.</p>

<p>Her only daughter today revealed she and her husband Prince Harry will welcome their baby in Spring 2019.</p>

<p>Announcing their baby news, Kensington Palace said today: 'Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.</p>

<p>'Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public'.</p>

<p>Last month Meghan's mother Doria was also seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California and royal sources have said she may move to London from the US to help her look after the baby because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny. </p>

<p>Ms Ragland issued a statement saying she was 'very happy at this lovely news and is looking forward to welcoming her first grandchild'- but Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether her father, Thomas Markle, had been told.</p>

<p>The Royal couple arrived on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, for their first major international tour since their world-stopping nuptials.</p>

<p>They shunned a private jet to travel on flight Qantas flight QF2 from London via Singapore.</p>

<p>The couple were in the first class cabin but non-royal passengers were also with them with one saying they were heard saying how 'excited' they were to be travelling to Australia. </p>

<p>With them was their entourage of 10 staff members, including press secretaries and a hairdresser, and several more security staff. </p>

<p>Royal fans already suspected the Duchess was pregnant after she wore a suspiciously wide-fitting Givenchy coat to Princess Eugenie's royal wedding on Friday.</p>

<p>Many TV viewers were sure they could see a baby-bump beneath her long, navy blue coat as the Duchess was whisked into St George's Chapel, Windsor by her doting husband. </p>

<p>The couple held hands when they arrived in Sydney early on Monday morning on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore.</p>

<p>Meghan was wearing her favourite Sarah Flint heels, which she teamed with the two tone coat she wore in a photo of her and Harry posing with the official 2018 Invictus Games flag last week.</p>

<p>Earlier she sparked a storm of pregnancy speculation after she touched down in Sydney clutching two purple folders in front of her stomach.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle was seen holding the items in her right arm as she stepped off the plane on Monday morning with Prince Harry, leaving fans of the Royal couple guessing what information they could contain. </p>

<p>For many, the folders added to speculation Meghan Markle is expecting a baby, fuelling the fire already stoked by the large blue coat she wore at Princess Eugenie's wedding last week. </p>

<p>The couple returned to their own wedding venue at Windsor Castle on Friday but missed a lavish second day of celebrations on Saturday because of their flight to Australia.  </p>

<p>There is already fevered excitement as to what Meghan and Harry will call their first-born.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's first child, expected in Spring 2019, will be seventh in line to the throne.</p>

<p>Bookmakers have already revealed the odds on the Queen's eight great-grandchild will be called, with Victoria, Albert and Arthur among the favourites.</p>

<p>There is also a chance Harry will want to call the baby Diana after his mother.</p>

<p>Boys' names:  </p>

<p>Albert 10/1 </p>

<p>Arthur 10/1 </p>

<p>Phillip 10/1  </p>

<p>Alfred 16/1 </p>

<p>Charles 16/1  </p>

<p>Girls' names: </p>

<p>Victoria 8/1 </p>

<p>Alice 12/1 </p>

<p>Diana 16/1 </p>

<p>Elizabeth 16/1 </p>

<p>Mary 16/1   </p>

<p>Today Prince Harry, who wore a grey jumper over a smart shirt, held his wife's hand as they left Sydney's airport terminal after arriving down under.</p>

<p>They were then whisked off to Admiralty House, the Governor-General's sprawling Sydney harbourside residence, where the couple are staying tonight. </p>

<p>While a heavy police presence greeted the couple at Sydney Airport ready to whisk them away, the pair will have a low-key start to their Australian tour, with official duties not starting until Tuesday giving them time to rest after the long-haul flight. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess arrived with a ten-person entourage in tow, which is believed to include press secretaries and a hairdresser.  </p>

<p>Meghan's best friend and stylist Jessica Mulroney is also expected to join the couple on the tour.</p>

<p>Jessica and her husband Ben are expected to fly from Toronto to Sydney to join Harry and Meghan in an 'unofficial' capacity - meaning they will pay their own expenses.</p>

<p>The Duchess could be expected to have to change outfits three times a day on the tour, and may turn to Jessica for help.  </p>

<p>A crowd of Royal fans turned out in the rain outside the Kirribilli address to welcome the pair. </p>

<p>But the streets of the suburb did not quite match up to the glamour as the visiting royal couple were greeted by discarded mattresses, chairs, milk crates, and pieces of carpet.</p>

<p>Despite the arrival day being organised months in advance, it coincided with one of North Sydney Council's fortnightly household waste collections, which meant battered goofs were left strewn on the streets as their car went by. </p>

<p>Prince Harry appeared to take some time out on Monday during his trip to Admiralty House, spotted perched on a step alongside a man believed to be a security guard (pictured)</p>

<p>The Royal Standard appears in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle take up residence for their Royal tour of Australia</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan will also visit Dubbo, in the New South Wales central west, Melbourne and Fraser Island in Queensland on their Australian tour, which is Meghan's first visit to the country.  </p>

<p>Flying from London to Sydney is a tiring journey, but The Duchess of Sussex was in the best possible cabin for the 23-hour trip – first class in a Qantas A380 (file picture).</p>

<p>It's a state-of-the-art aircraft with in-built anti-jet-lag technology.</p>

<p>It produces 50 per cent less cabin noise than a 747 and has cabin air pressure that's equivalent to an altitude of 1,500 metres (5,000ft). The 747's is 2,500 metres (8,000ft).</p>

<p>Plus, cabin air is recycled every two minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh.</p>

<p>Then there's the Qantas touch.</p>

<p>Meghan would have been in an 'expansive armchair' that converts to a fully flat bed.</p>

<p>Cabin crew would have given her a pillow menu, a 100 per cent cotton woven throw, a duvet and a memory foam mattress. And cotton pyjamas with matching slippers.</p>

<p>She would also have been able to enjoy an in-seat massage at the touch of a button and pressed another one to lower and raise the window blinds.</p>

<p>It's definitely an aircraft fit for pregnant royalty.  </p>

<p>They will spend a week in the country and then on Tuesday, October 23 they will head to Fiji for two days and then on to Tonga before returning to Australia.</p>

<p>On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31. </p>

<p>'The programme across these four Commonwealth countries will focus on youth leadership, environmental and conservation efforts, including the dedication of several new Queen's Commonwealth Canopy projects, and the recovery and rehabilitation of servicemen and women through the Invictus Games Sydney 2018,' the palace said in a short statement when announcing the tour itinerary.  </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend 76 engagements across the four countries, including the Invictus Games in Sydney, which runs from October 20 and October 28.</p>

<p>Prince Harry founded the sporting event, which gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball, in 2014.</p>

<p>The couple will mark the games' launch and closing ceremony. </p>

<p>And to officially welcome the Invictus Games to the city, Prince Harry, prime minister Scott Morrison and athletes will scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge to plant the Invictus flag. </p>

<p>Among the other highlights of their tour will be a visit to the world-renowned Taronga Zoo, in Sydney, where they will meet two koalas and their joeys. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the zoo with Prince George during their royal tour in 2014.</p>

<p>Elsewhere the couple will visit Australian farmers struck by drought. </p>

<p>The couple's arrival in Australia comes just days after they attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank where they told close family their happy news. </p>

<p>Revealed: How Meghan and Harry's baby will be SEVENTH in line to the throne - but WON'T be a prince or princess</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. </p>

<p>The child will come behind his or her father Prince Harry in the line of succession, bumping his uncle, the Duke of York, further down the line into eighth place.  </p>

<p>However the child will not be given the title of prince or princess unless the Queen steps into change the rules. Instead a son would be styled the Earl of Dumbarton, while a daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor. </p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. The couple, pictured two weeks ago, announced today that they are expecting their first child</p>

<p>It means Harry's uncle the Duke of York will be bumped further down the line into eighth place. Pictured, Prince Andrew with daughter Princess Eugenie at her wedding last Friday</p>

<p>The BT Tower in London beams out a congratulations message for Harry and Meghan</p>

<p>Where will the baby fall in the line of succession?</p>

<p>Seventh in line. The baby will bump Harry's uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession.</p>

<p>Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queen's youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time to 11th in line.</p>

<p>How will the baby be related to the Queen?</p>

<p>The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales's grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's niece or nephew.</p>

<p>Will he or she ever be monarch?</p>

<p>Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.</p>

<p>What will the baby be called?</p>

<p>William and Kate chose royal favourites for their children.</p>

<p>But will Harry and American-born Meghan go classic or break the royal mould when naming their baby?</p>

<p>If they stay traditional, something like Alice, Mary, Elizabeth or Victoria for a girl, and James, Philip, Frederick or Arthur for a boy are possibilities.</p>

<p>In the US, the most popular name for a baby girl is Emma and Liam for a baby boy.</p>

<p>Will the baby be a prince or princess?</p>

<p>No they will not be a prince nor a princess, nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in 1917.</p>

<p>So what will their title be?</p>

<p>A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his father's other lesser titles as a courtesy title.</p>

<p>Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom.</p>

<p>A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>But the Queen could change this?</p>

<p>Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of George's birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridges' children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.</p>

<p>Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny?</p>

<p>Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. </p>

<p>But Meghan's mother Doria has been seen attending baby care classes, suggesting that she may move to the UK to help out. </p>

<p>When and where will the baby be born?</p>

<p>Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-law's lead. Harry was also born there in 1984. It is close to Kensington Palace and well practised at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But Meghan could do down a different path and have a home birth. </p>

<p>Will the baby have dual citizenship?</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship. Meghan is planning to become a British citizen - but it is not known whether she will hold dual nationality, and at present is still a US citizen.</p>

<p>Kensington Palace announced today the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with her first child. The baby is expected in Spring next year. </p>

<p>The happy news was announced hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney for their first major international tour since their wedding in May.</p>

<p>A Kensington Palace said: 'Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.</p>

<p>'Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.'</p>

<p>The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were told in person at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday.  </p>

<p>Rumours were rife that Meghan may be pregnant after her mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena with a view to looking after her new grandchild. </p>

<p>The duchess has also been seen in a number of looser-fitting outfits over recent weeks.  </p>

<p>The new royal baby is expected to take the surname Sussex in the same way that Prince William's children, George, Charlotte and Louis have taken his title Cambridge as their last name at school and nursery. </p>

<p>The baby will supersede Prince Andrew in the line of succession, regardless of whether they are a boy or a girl, following a 2011 change in law that granted the same status to sons and daughters.</p>

<p>However as the second son of the current Prince of Wales, Harry's children are not automatically given the title of prince or princess.</p>

<p>King George V - Harry's great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in 1917.</p>

<p>This means Harry and Meghan's first born, as a great-grandchild of the sovereign, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH.</p>

<p>George V declared that: 'the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.'</p>

<p>The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his father's lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debrett's.</p>

<p>So a first son of Harry's would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. </p>

<p>A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons Lord (first name) Mounbatten-Windsor.</p>

<p>But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghan's children to be HRHs and princes and princesses.</p>

<p>Ahead of Prince George's birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles.</p>

<p>Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince.</p>

<p>The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghan's baby.  </p>

<p>The Earl and Countess of Wessex's children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign.</p>

<p>But the couple decided, with the Queen's agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement in November 2017, shortly after confirming their relationship. </p>

<p>The couple married at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May this year. </p>

<p>Princess Eugenie's mother today tweeted a picture of her royal wedding outfit at the exact moment the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced they were having a baby.</p>

<p>Kensington Palace officially revealed the pregnancy at 8.40am this morning, on what is the 59th birthday of Eugenie's mother Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York.</p>

<p>And at that exact time of the announcement, Sarah posted a tweet thanking the designer of her dress for the outfit worn on her daughter's big day last Friday. </p>

<p>She then posted three further messages saying how 'proud' she was of her daughter and new son-in-law Jack Brooksbank - but made no mention of Harry and Meghan.</p>

<p>Eugenie's father the Duke of York, who wished his ex-wife Sarah a 'very happy day' on her birthday today, also retweeted one of Sarah's tweets featuring Eugenie and Jack.</p>

<p>The news of Harry and Meghan's pregnancy was revealed at 8.40am today - and at that exact time, Eugenie's mother Sarah, Duchess of York posted a tweet about her daughter's big day</p>

<p> The Duchess of York also posted a series of pictures this morning following Eugenie's wedding</p>

<p>She said how 'proud' she was of Jack and Eugenie following their wedding in Windsor on Friday</p>

<p> Eugenie is pictured with her father outside St George's Chapel, in another image shared today</p>

<p>Prince Andrew also made no mention of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's news. </p>

<p>But the Clarence House Twitter account - which represents the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall - did retweet the Kensington Palace baby announcement.</p>

<p>Senior royals attending Eugenie's wedding at Windsor Castle last Friday were told by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle that they were expecting their first child. </p>

<p>It comes after Prince Andrew rejected calls from within Buckingham Palace for a more modest wedding for Eugenie and Jack amid concerns about the public cost. </p>

<p>Eugenie and Jack's wedding last Friday was a lavish and star-studded affair, with celebrities from Robbie Williams to Demi Moore and Naomi Campbell to Pixie Geldof.</p>

<p>Harry and Meghan were wed at the same chapel in another impressive wedding in May, and their news emerged as their first tour outside the UK and Ireland begins.</p>

<p>The couple arrived in Sydney today ahead of their hotly-anticipated 16-day tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. </p>

<p>Eugenie's star-studded two-day event garnered huge media attention, but many have questioned whether the minor royal's occasion warranted such extravagance. </p>

<p>It is thought royal aides were concerned about public reaction to the extravagant celebrations, which cost the taxpayer £2million, and suggested toning it down.</p>

<p>Palace sources said it was the Duke of York who insisted his daughter take a carriage ride through Windsor, mimicking Harry and Meghan earlier this year.</p>

<p>Speaking ahead of Eugenie's wedding last Friday, her father Prince Andrew, Duke of York, talked about how it would be very different to Harry and Meghan's big day.</p>

<p>He told ITV's This Morning: 'It will not be the same as the previous one that was held in May. It's not a public wedding, this is meant to be a family wedding.</p>

<p>'They've got so many friends and they need a church of that size to fit them all in.'</p>

<p>Minor royal weddings in the past have been short and held in private - a stark contrast to celebrations over the weekend.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Cambridge talks to Harry and Meghan at the wedding in Windsor last week</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Sussex at the wedding at St George's Chapel in Windsor last Friday</p>

<p>Their service at St Stephen Walbrook Church in the City of London lasted just 30 minutes and 200 guests were invited. But Eugenie handed out 1,400 invitations.</p>

<p>The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are said to be 'delighted' for Harry and Meghan. </p>

<p>Doria Ragland, the mother of the duchess, is 'very happy about this lovely news' and 'looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild'. </p>

<p>A Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.</p>

<p>Last Friday, Eugenie shared two shy kisses on the West Steps of St George's Chapel with her new husband Jack after their lavish royal wedding ceremony. </p>

<p>The couple tentatively performed the kisses for the cameras on the steps, which were decorated with masses of autumn flowers and lined with Grenadier Guards.</p>

<p>After their afternoon reception in Windsor Castle, Jack drove Eugenie away in a silver DB10 Aston Martin sports car. The wedding drew in a peak of 3.9million on ITV.</p>

<p>Kensington Palace the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their first child together hours after they touched down in Sydney for their first major international tour since their wedding in May. The baby is due in Spring 2019.</p>

<p>A Kensington Palace said: 'Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.</p>

<p>'Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.'</p>

<p>The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were told in person at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday.</p>

<p>Rumours were rife that Meghan may be pregnant after her mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena with a view to looking after her new grandchild.</p>

<p>Memes captured just how excited fans were over the pregnancy announcement today. Others claimed they were not shocked at the news the Duchess of Sussex is expecting her first child</p>

<p>TV shows, films and royal photos all provided inspiration for the hilarious royal baby memes</p>

<p>The duchess has also been seen in a number of loose-fitting outfits over recent weeks.</p>

<p>The royal cover-up: How Meghan used subtle styling tricks to hide her baby bump - from structured coats to peplum tops and clever draping </p>

<p>The Duchess of Sussex hid her growing baby bump with a series of clever styling tricks, MailOnline can reveal.</p>

<p>Meghan, who announced her pregnancy this morning via Kensington Palace, is already in her second trimester but has managed to keep her news under wraps thanks to some carefully-planned fashion hacks.</p>

<p>She will no doubt have sought the advice from her stylist and confidante Jessica Mulroney, a mother-of-three who is joining her on her first major overseas tour with Prince Harry this week. </p>

<p>Touching down in Sydney on Monday, just hours before her happy news was announced, fans couldn't help but notice the strategically-placed plastic folders Meghan was clutching to her chest. </p>

<p>What baby bump? Just hours before Harry and Meghan's happy news was announced this morning, fans couldn't help but notice the strategically-placed plastic folders the Duchess was clutching to her chest after touching down in Sydney in an oversized coat and polo neck</p>

<p>Meghan's choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie's wedding - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame (pictured with the Queen and Prince Harry outside St. George's Chapel)</p>

<p>But it was her choice of clothing that was the most telling, with the Duchess - once a fan of figure-hugging silhouettes - wrapping up in a turtleneck jumper and oversized navy coat.</p>

<p>Likewise, her choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie's wedding last week - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, it was also the day that Meghan and Harry chose to share their happy news with the rest of the family. </p>

<p>Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage told Femail: 'We are so used to seeing Meghan in form-fitting apparel, it was hard not to speculate that a new arrival was imminent when she recently started to sport baggier items. </p>

<p>'The use of knee-length coats has cleverly helped Meghan avoid speculation and, as it's now very much the autumnal season, the use of long oversized coats didn't arouse suspicion. </p>

<p>Dad's genius hack allows toddler to clean up as she plays</p>

<p>'I particularly like the navy coat [which Meghan wore in Sydney today] and styling it how she has; by doing up the top two buttons and allowing the rest to move freely away from her body to create drape and disguise any bump. </p>

<p>'It's also interesting to see how she keeps her legs on show even when wearing heavy coats - another styling trick to making her look less covered and avoid speculation.' </p>

<p>The Duchess is at least three months into her first pregnancy, and has already had a successful 12 week scan - suggesting that she fell pregnant around mid-July.  </p>

<p>Covering up: Meghan wore an oversized blue coat for the launch of a charity cookbook at Kensington Palace last month (pictured with Prince Harry and mother Doria Ragland, who said today she was 'very happy' about the couple's pregnancy news and may move to the UK)</p>

<p>Baby blue? The Duchess of Sussex wore a baggy Jason Wu number when she joined Prince Harry at a gala music evening in September - sending the baby rumour mill into overdrive</p>

<p>While any baby bump will not have been visible until recently, the mother-to-be has been careful to avoid fuelling speculation by keeping her tummy firmly covered.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, she visited Sussex in a businesslike bottle-green ensemble but was careful to drape a structured coat over the top to carefully conceal her silhouette.    </p>

<p>Likewise, a draped Givenchy dress she wore to the Royal Academy of Arts in September and a peplum Oscar de la Renta top she wore in Loughborough, worked wonders to hide her midriff.  </p>
