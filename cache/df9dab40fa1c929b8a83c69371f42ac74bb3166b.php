<p>They are now working towards getting as many supporters inside St James' as is safe from the start of October.</p>

<p>Box holders are the first to be consulted and the next step will be finding a way to include season-ticket holders on long-term payment plans.</p>

<p>Although exact numbers are yet to be determined, it is hoped that significantly more than a third of the 52,000 capacity will be able to attend matches at St James' once it is given the sign off by the Premier League.</p>
