<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An antiques auctioneer has been linked to a bogus reviews scam involving Amazon.</p>

<p>Justin Fryer reviewed £15,000 worth of products last month alone, giving his five-star approval on items ranging from smartphones to electric scooters on average once every four hours.</p>

<p>The US-based online retailer launched an investigation after he was identified as the site’s most prolific product reviewer in Britain. Most of his approvals were for little-known Chinese brands that often offer to send reviewers products for free in return for positive posts.</p>

<p>Justin Fryer reviewed £15,000 worth of products last month alone, giving his five-star approval on average once every four hours</p>

<p>According to the Financial Times, Mr Fryer appeared to have sold many of the goods he reviewed on eBay, making nearly £20,000 since June. The Mail has now established that he is a 48-year-old former director of an auction firm in Cobham, Surrey, which collapsed in 2017.</p>

<p>Mr Fryer describes himself on his Amazon profile as the UK’s top reviewer, with an astonishing 1,933 reviews. Since February, items he has approved include three gazebos, more than a dozen vacuum cleaners and ten laptops, as well as everything from dolls’ houses to a ‘fat removal’ machine.</p>

<p>His contributions typically involved a video of the product being unboxed, accompanied by comments about the item’s exterior features.</p>

<p>Many of the same products were then listed as ‘unopened’ and ‘unused’ on an eBay account registered under Mr Fryer’s details.</p>

<p>On August 13, he sold an electric scooter for £485.99. His Amazon review of the same product described it as ‘hands down my favourite toy’. His profile adds: ‘I enjoy writing reviews and being part of the community and strive to be one of the best hopefully, I hope you find my opinions helpful ... After a long time reviewing and many many reviews, I find myself as Amazon Top Reviewer.’</p>

<p>The profile is illustrated with an image of a woman he calls his fiancée, Lin Pan, who was company secretary of the failed auction business, Fryer &amp; Brown Auctions.</p>

<p>Amazon, which has repeatedly claimed it is clamping down on the issue, said it wants customers to be sure that reviews are ‘authentic and relevant'</p>

<p>Mr Fryer did not respond to requests for a comment.</p>

<p>He has denied being paid or receiving free products in return for positive reviews and insists his eBay listings were for duplicates of products he reviewed.</p>

<p>He has, however, deleted his review history from Amazon’s website. Mr Fryer added: ‘I know some of the sellers. My partner’s Chinese and I know a lot of the businesses over there... and I just review.’</p>

<p>The report raises more questions over fake or manipulated reviews on Amazon. The Competition and Markets Authority has also launched a probe into online stores over suspicious reviews.</p>

<p>Amazon, which has repeatedly claimed it is clamping down on the issue, said it wants customers to be sure that reviews are ‘authentic and relevant.’ Neena Bhati, of Which?, said: ‘Online platforms must put more effective measures in place to stop unscrupulous sellers gaming the system with ease.’ </p>
