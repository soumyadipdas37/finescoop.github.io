<p>The men aged between 18 and 19 years old were granted bail after being charged over the alleged attack at Queen Street Mall in central Brisbane on Friday night.</p>

<p>They have been charged with attempted murder, armed robbery, going armed as to cause far and acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm.</p>

<p>Somali-born Sade Mohamed, 18, is accused of being the 'doer' of the stabbing - which followed the 16-year-old allegedly hitting someone with a stick nearby.</p>

<p>An elite private school student on a basketball scholarship has been charged with attempted murder after a 16-year-old suffered a collapsed lung in an alleged stabbing at Brisbane's Queen Street Mall (pictured, file image) on Friday night</p>

<p>The younger teenager was allegedly stabbed in the back and chest and was found with puncture wounds to his torso.</p>

<p>Mohamed - whose barrister said there was no evidence to suggest his client was the main offender - attends the prestigious St James College in the inner-city Brisbane suburb of Spring Hill.</p>

<p>The barrister Sam Di Carlo also denied any suggestion the stabbing was gang-related.  </p>

<p>'This can be distinguished from the case of two gangs at war,' Mr Di Carlo said, according to The Courier-Mail.</p>

<p>'This arises over an incident and is immediate retribution.'</p>

<p>Mohamed was granted bail on the condition he live with family close to Logan Central Police Station so he can report to authorities daily.</p>

<p>The court heard Mohamed was due to take his Year 12 exams and had basketball training outside of school hours.</p>

<p>Sade Mohamed - who attends the prestigious St James College in the inner-city Brisbane suburb of Spring Hill - has been granted bail on the condition he reports daily to authorities</p>

<p>The court also heard the 16-year-old alleged victim had used social media to make threats after the stabbing.</p>

<p>Ms Thacker said she feared Mohamed may face retaliation over the allegations.</p>

<p>Mohamed and the other three men - Mohamed Kenneh, 19, Said Abdi, 18, and Abdirahan Aden Warsame, 19, will appear back in court in October.</p>

<p>Kenneh has taken part in charity work and Ms Thacker said she was surprised he was charged with the allegations, ABC News reported.</p>

<p>The accused will re-appear in court in October.</p>
