<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Barcelona's hopes of signing Lautaro Martinez this summer look to have ended with Inter Milan refusing to lower their £83million price tag.</p>

<p>The Argentine has been a prime target for the Catalan club for some time as they look to rejuvenate their squad after a difficult season, with Martinez reportedly also keen on the move.</p>

<p>Barca's chiefs were poised to make a final bid for the 23-year-old after Ronald Koeman informed Luis Suarez he wasn't in his plans this season.</p>

<p>Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez (R) looks unlikely to move to Barcelona this summer</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman appears to have missed out on his target after Inter's firmness on £83m price</p>

<p>But according to Marca, the Serie A side are standing firm with their hefty figure for the 23-year-old, which has effectively priced Barca out of the deal. </p>

<p>The report indicates Barca have not given up on their man, but accept the deal is now 'extremely complicated'. </p>

<p>As a result, the player's agent has revealed Martinez will be staying at the San Siro this summer, commenting: 'At the moment, isn't moving from he is here.'  </p>

<p>Given the Spanish club's financial situation due to the economic context of the coronavirus crisis, they are unlikely to be able to spend big this summer.</p>

<p>The 23-year-old (R) is exciting talent and formed formidable partnership with Romelu Lukaku</p>

<p>Inter club president Javier Zanetti previously moved to quell rumours of the striker wanting a move away, stating his future lies with the Nerazzurri.</p>

<p>'Lautaro isn't leaving Inter,' Zanetti told Fox Sports, via Marca.</p>

<p>'It's not just Barcelona who are interested in him, but Lautaro knows that he's at a great club already.</p>

<p>'He looks happy with life in Italy, which isn't easy. I think he's going down the right path. For now, he's not leaving. He's our present and future. There's respect on the clubs' part.</p>

<p>'There are players that have release clauses and there's little you can do when a club comes in and pays it. But in Lautaro's case, he's just fine at Inter and I can tell when he's happy.' </p>

<p>Vice-president Javier Zanetti insists that Martinez remains happy with life in Italy</p>

<p>Martinez scored 21 times in 49 appearances last season and helped Antonio Conte's side reach the Europa League final, where they were beaten in a thriller by Sevilla. </p>

<p>Barca are now likely to move onto other targets for their forward position, with Lyon star Memphis Depay strongly linked and representing a much cheaper option for the Spanish side. </p>
