<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An oligarch friend of Vladimir Putin and his ex-wife are still embroiled in a divorce dispute years after telling a judge they had settled their differences over his fortune.</p>

<p>Wealthy Russian businessman Arkady Rotenberg, a former judo partner of the Russian President, and his ex-wife Natalia began fighting over money in 2014.</p>

<p>Mr Justice Moor oversaw private hearings in the Family Division of the High Court in London and Court of Appeal judges also considered issues.</p>

<p>By the end of 2017 an agreement had been reached, which Mr Justice Moor approved.</p>

<p>Arkady Rotenberg (pictured with Vladimir Putin) and his ex-wife are still embroiled in dispute in a London court - several years after telling a judge that they had settled their differences</p>

<p>But litigation subsequently resumed and, on Friday, Mr Justice Moor oversaw the latest in a number of recent hearings. </p>

<p>The judge heard the latest stage of the case in private.</p>

<p>He said detail of the current issues could not be revealed but said journalists could report the fact that the hearing had taken place and the dispute was continuing.</p>

<p>The litigation hit the headlines in early 2018, when Mr Rotenberg failed in a bid to keep his name out of the newspapers.</p>

<p>Mr Rotenberg, a long-time acquaintance of Mr Putin, had argued that his name and that of his ex-wife should not feature in media reports because of safety concerns.</p>

<p>The wealthy Russian businessman and his ex-wife Natalia began fighting over money in 2014 </p>

<p>Journalists disagreed and editors at the Times persuaded judges to rule the pair should be identified.</p>

<p>The newspaper won free speech fights in the High Court and Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>Four years earlier, Mr Rotenberg had been one of a number of people made the subject of sanctions by European Union ministers.</p>

<p>They froze funds and imposed a 'ban on staying' in EU territories against people whose 'actions' threatened the independence of Ukraine.</p>

<p>A ruling published by the General Court of the European Union described Mr Rotenberg as a 'long-time acquaintance' of Mr Putin, and cited business activities which undermined the 'territorial integrity' of Ukraine.</p>
