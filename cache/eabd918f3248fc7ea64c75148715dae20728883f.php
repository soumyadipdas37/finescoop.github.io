<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A nudist has his 'potato chip-resembling' toenail removed and his foul foot fungus burnt off in My Feet Are Killing Me! </p>

<p>Tonight's episode of the show, which airs on Quest Red, features Robert Shearn III, from New Jersey, who from the ankles up, is just like any ordinary man. </p>

<p>He's fit, active and enjoys the outdoors, but for the past year, Robert has been hiding an embarrassing secret, and one he's desperate to get rid of. </p>

<p>'I started noticing my feet problems last year,' he says. 'Toenail fungus, the nail has fallen off my big toe a couple of times, and I'm embarrassed about it.' </p>

<p>Robert Shearn III (pictured), from New Jersey, has his 'potato chip-resembling' toenail removed and his foul foot fungus burnt off in tonight's episode of Quest Red's My Feet Are Killing Me!</p>

<p>When  Dr Shaeffer removes Robert's shoes and socks, he reveals a half chipped, flaky set of toenails and some of the foulest toenail fungus he's ever seen (pictured)</p>

<p>While unsightly and painful, Robert's foot problems also stop him from enjoying his favorite pass time. </p>

<p>'Well, I've been a nudist for about 20 years,' he explains to foot and ankle surgeon Dr Brad Shaeffer. 'I don't want to have to hide my feet in the sand every time I go to the nude beach!' </p>

<p>Taking his patient's surprising hobby in his stride, the expert reassures Robert that he'll be strutting his stuff at the beach again in no time. </p>

<p>'Your feet have to match your mind and body, right? That's where I come in.' </p>

<p>Removing Robert's shoes and socks, Dr Shaeffer reveals a half chipped, flaky set of toenails and some of the foulest toenail fungus he's ever seen. </p>

<p>'They're yellow, they're brittle, and they're kind of falling off,' he explains, stunned at the state of Robert's feet. 'The worst is definitely the big toenail on his left foot. It's very crusty and it's bubbly and brittle, almost like potato chips!'</p>

<p>The good news is that Dr Schaeffer has a robust strategy for treating Robert's toenails, one that he can put into practice right away. </p>

<p>The expert says the worst is definitely the big toenail on Robert's left foot (pictured) - and describes it as 'very crusty, bubbly and brittle'</p>

<p>The expert explains that he'll have to remove the worst toenail altogether because it's 'too far gone' (pictured)</p>

<p>'What we're going to do is remove this toenail, because it's too far gone at this point,' Dr Schaeffer explains. 'For the other toenails we have a laser therapy and it will kill and treat your fungus right now.' </p>

<p>Fungal nail infections are common. They're not serious but they can take a long time to treat.</p>

<p>Fungal nail infections usually affect your toenails, but you can get them on your fingernails, too.</p>

<p>Fungal nail infections usually start at the edge of the nail.</p>

<p>They often then spread to the middle. The nail becomes discoloured and lifts off.</p>

<p>The nail becomes brittle and pieces can break off. It can cause pain and swelling in the skin around the nail.</p>

<p>Happy with the plan, Robert agrees to go ahead and get the treatment done. First things first for Dr Shaeffer, and it's the unpleasant job of removing the toenail. </p>

<p>'So the first step of treatment is removing that really unsightly toenail on his left foot,' he says as he numbs the area. </p>

<p>After chipping the nail off bit by bit, the expert than cleans the nail bed and wraps it up for protection. </p>

<p>With the big toe dealt with, the expert moves swiftly on to treating Robert's foot fungus with the laser. </p>

<p>'The laser therapy is going to penetrate the nail and kill the fungus underneath the nail,' he explains. </p>

<p>The bad news for Robert is that it's not the most comfortable procedure to endure. </p>

<p>'When you're doing laser treatment to someone's toenails it can get a little hot,' Dr Shaeffer says. </p>

<p>From the off, Robert feels the heat and winces in pain throughout the procedure. </p>

<p>'Ooh I feel that,' he says. </p>

<p>Once the procedure is over, Robert's feet are nearly as good as new, and he can't wait to get back to the beach.</p>

<p>'Now when I go to nude beaches people aren't going to be looking at my feet, nobody is looking down when they meet you,' Robert jokes. </p>

<p>My Feet Are Killing Me airs 10pm on Tuesdays exclusively on Quest Red, or stream on dplay </p>
