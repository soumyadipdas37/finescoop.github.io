<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dancing With The Stars is making sure their 29th season can be smooth and safe.</p>

<p>So, the production made health a priority when the cast of celebrities and dancers met at the LA studio for rehearsal on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Before any dancing began, each and every talent was tested for COVID-19 from inside their car.</p>

<p>Safe and souncd: Dancing With The Stars made sure to take plenty of health precautions ahead of practice on Wednesday, where supposed dance pair Peta Murgatroyd and Vernon Davis were both seen getting tested for COVID-19 from their cars in the parking lot </p>

<p>Rolling up: Before any dancing began, each and every talent was tested</p>

<p>A pair of medical professionals in white lab coats, face masks, gloves and face shields were there to take their specimens.</p>

<p>NFL alum Vernon Davis, 36, was seen rolling up to practice in an SUV, then poking his head out the window to get a swab taken.</p>

<p>Ready: NFL alum Vernon Davis, 36, was seen rolling up to practice in an SUV, then poking his head out the window to get a swab taken</p>

<p>Each specimen was promptly placed into a bio-hazard bag, where it could be taken care of.</p>

<p>It was unclear what exact type of testing the DWTS cast was going through.</p>

<p>Antigen tests looking for specific proteins related to SARS-CoV-2 can return results in as little as 15-minutes, but there is a high false-negative rate, meaning almost half of the negative results could be inaccurate, according to Science Magazine.</p>

<p>The more reliable genetic 'PCR' tests usually require a day or more turn-around for results but is considered the 'gold standard' for testing.</p>

<p>Testing type? It was unclear what exact type of testing the DWTS cast was going through, but the rapid turn around suggested they were testing for antigens, a strategy that can be less accurate</p>
