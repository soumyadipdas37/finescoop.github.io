<p>Jessica bid farewell to EastEnders last month when her character was killed by husband Gray following months of abuse.</p>

<p>The soap star shared an emotional message with her Instagram followers as she cleared out her dressing room for the last time.</p>

<p>Alongside a picture on set, she penned: 'Now that the dust has slightly settled, I’d just like to say.. On a personal note, I am in absolute bits to be leaving the show.</p>

<p>Leaving: Jessica bid farewell to the soap EastEnders earlier this month when her character was brutally murdered by her abusive husband Gray</p>

<p>'I miss even this bits I thought I hated (that dodgy outside toilet near the police station with 20 million spiders) All of it has been a dream come true. Without getting speechy, I owe SO many people my thanks for believing in me on my journey.</p>

<p>'Julia Crampsie, my agent Jonathan, Liza Mellody, Carolyn Weinstein, Jon Sen, Kate Oates .. and SO many more, including our viewers. [sic]'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I came from a girl band, wanting nothing more than to prove myself as the actor I trained to be.</p>

<p>'I was trusted with such an important story, on one of the most iconic soaps in history❤️❤️❤️ Thank you!! It has been an unbelievable 20 months.</p>

<p>'Finally I can watch EastEnders again as a viewer, without cringing whenever I hear my voice. [sic]'</p>

<p>The storyline of her character, Chantelle, culminated in her decision to leave her controlling spouse, Gray [Toby Alexander-Smith] following years of mental and physical abuse. </p>

<p>She was ultimately killed off at the hands of her husband, which JEastEnders' Executive Producer said was an important yet tragic topic that needed to be explored on the show. </p>

<p>EP Jon Sen told MailOnline: 'Chantelle's story is such an important one to tell accurately and upon both character's inception we planned her tragic ending with the intention of embedding the stark reality of domestic abuse at the heart of the Atkins family.</p>

<p>'Being able to shed light on the realities of what goes on behind closed doors has never been more crucial given the harrowing statistics as a result of the current pandemic and hopefully Chantelle's story will encourage people to speak out to someone they trust and get the support that they need.</p>

<p>'Jessica's performance is nothing short of extraordinary and even in her final scenes, the audience will be moved by Chantelle's strength.'</p>

<p>He also commented on her departure from the longstanding BBC One soap and said: 'We're very sorry so see Jessica go but hope that her impact on viewers is long-lasting.'</p>
