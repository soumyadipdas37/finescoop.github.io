<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>After N'Golo Kante gave the impression of being superhuman for so long, the breakdown was inevitable but still a shock.</p>

<p>Indefatigable, indomitable, invulnerable, the Frenchman has so often performed the duties of two men in the Chelsea midfield.</p>

<p>Antonio Conte and Maurizio Sarri pushed Kante's body to its limit for three seasons, playing him in every minute of football they could, and Frank Lampard was left to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p>N'Golo Kante in action for Chelsea in their friendly against Brighton as the new season nears</p>

<p>Former Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is keen for a reunion with Kante at Inter Milan </p>

<p>Last season was the one in which Chelsea's midfield marathon runner finally hit his wall. The heavy workload caught up with Kante, who suffered a series of injuries and only played in 28 of 55 club matches.</p>

<p>So it seems incredibly harsh that Kante has been linked with a move away from Stamford Bridge during this summer window.</p>

<p>The latest is that Chelsea have rejected an offer from Inter Milan that involved Christian Eriksen and Marcelo Brozovic coming the other way in part-exchange for Kante.</p>

<p>It seems that Conte, now the manager of Inter, wishes to run Kante into the ground some more but in a different league.</p>

<p>But Lampard has always publicly insisted that Kante isn't for sale and if they're to sell any of their midfielders this summer, it would be Jorginho instead.</p>

<p>'I've said it a lot of times about N'Golo - one of the best midfield players in the world. I would have loved to be able to play with him. He has everything,' Lampard said back in June.</p>

<p>Kante suffered an injury-disrupted 2019-20 season with five separate setbacks </p>

<p>There have also been questions asked of whether Kante has adapted to Lampard's systems</p>

<p>Besides, they have little interest in former Tottenham man Eriksen or the Croatian Brozovic, who would be more of a direct replacement in defensive midfield.</p>

<p>But the indications are that there would at least be a discussion over selling Kante should the right offer materialise - and that means a change in status for a player deemed absolutely indispensable for so long.</p>

<p>So should Chelsea sell Kante? The crux of the arguments in favour seems to be that, at the age of 29, Kante must be past his peak.</p>

<p>The perception is that the golden years of Kante started in 2015, when he joined Leicester City from Caen and led them to that miraculous Premier League title triumph.</p>

<p>They continued as he helped France to the final of Euro 2016, moved to Chelsea that summer for £32m and made it back-to-back Premier League wins.</p>

<p>A move to Chelsea followed and the Frenchman once again lifted the Premier League trophy</p>

<p>The following season saw FA Cup victory swiftly followed by a starring role in France's World Cup win. Under Sarri, he fought fatigue again and again to help Chelsea to the UEFA Europa League.</p>

<p>Achievements that will be difficult to surpass, but it doesn't necessarily mean Kante is suddenly past his best as he approaches 30.</p>

<p>This argument goes hand-in-hand with the one that suggests the 2019-20 season proves Kante is now an injury liability.</p>

<p>He suffered five separate injury issues throughout the campaign, including a sprained ankle and hamstring problems.</p>

<p>Kante played in just 22 of Chelsea's 38 Premier League games during Lampard's first season and watched most of the post-restart action from the stands.</p>

<p>Fit enough only to start on the bench in the FA Cup final loss to Arsenal, Lampard looked elsewhere to freshen things up after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's second goal.</p>

<p>The midfielder played through injury issues to help Chelsea win the Europa League in 2019</p>

<p>LEICESTER CITY</p>

<p>2015-16</p>

<p>3,193 minutes in all competitions</p>

<p>Played in 37 of 38 league games</p>

<p>CHELSEA</p>

<p>2016-17</p>

<p>3,556 minutes</p>

<p>Started 35 league games</p>

<p>2017-18</p>

<p>4,207 minutes</p>

<p>Started 34 league games</p>

<p>2018-19</p>

<p>4,185 minutes</p>

<p>Played in 36 league and 10 Europa League games</p>

<p>2019-20</p>

<p>2,303 minutes</p>

<p>Suffered five separate injury issues</p>

<p>But this breakdown in fitness was always going to happen. The mileage Kante had put in over the previous five seasons for club and country was truly extreme.</p>

<p>He missed just one of Leicester's Premier League games during that unforgettable 2015-16 season, starting 33 of the 38 and subbed off just twice in all of those.</p>

<p>Conte played Kante in 3,139 minutes out of a possible 3,420 in the league during his first season at Chelsea and 2,998 minutes the following season - not to mention a hefty chunk of their Champions League and FA Cup runs.</p>

<p>Sarri flogged his midfield workhorse as well. Kante missed just two league games in 2018-19, starting 36 of the 37 matches he was fit and available for.</p>

<p>Things reached a tipping point when he played the whole of the Europa League final in Baku despite clearly being hindered by a knee injury.</p>

<p>With France, he played every minute of their World Cup campaign in Russia until being taken off 55 minutes into the final when at risk of a second yellow card.</p>

<p>So Lampard really hasn't enjoyed the full benefit of Kante in his midfield, the result of injuries triggered by previous exertions.</p>

<p>A fully-fit Kante will still do a stellar job for Lampard and Chelsea, the manager's warm words from the summer suggesting he will feature regularly in the season ahead.</p>

<p>Nor is there a contractual imperative for Chelsea to offload him. Kante's current deal, worth £290,000-a-week, was signed back in November 2018 and has almost three years to run.</p>

<p>It could be argued Chelsea may want to get Kante off their wage bill but money doesn't exactly seem to be an object after a summer spending spree of more than £200million.</p>

<p>So that leaves the argument of whether Kante remains the right fit in Lampard's midfield.</p>

<p>Given his injury setbacks, it goes without saying really that Jorginho, Mateo Kovacic and Mason Mount all enjoyed better seasons in 2019-20.</p>

<p>Jorginho has been playing the deep-lying playmaker role in Lampard's midfield set-up</p>

<p>There have been questions over whether Kante suits Lampard's 4-3-3 system, which sees him required to perform a box-to-box role instead of shielding the defence.</p>

<p>Kante has usually prospered in a two-man central midfield set-up and when stationed behind someone else. His tireless work rate and ability to cover plenty of ground means he looks far more comfortable.</p>

<p>Instead it's often been Jorginho sitting in and trying to dictate things, with Chelsea achieving some notable results along the way as they finished fourth.</p>

<p>So even when fully fit, Kante is likely to face stiff competition for midfield places and may not necessarily be the automatic pick he was under Lampard's two predecessors.</p>

<p>There's also the possibility that Chelsea's summer spending spree could continue with Declan Rice coming in from West Ham. </p>

<p>The arrival of Declan Rice from West Ham would offer more direct competition for Kante </p>

<p>The England international, 21, would certainly offer more direct competition for Kante's place at the base of the midfield though some will see Rice as a future centre-half.  </p>

<p>But a little bit of competition and rotation may help Kante's body withstand the rigours of what will be an unprecedentedly hectic season followed by the rearranged Euro 2020.</p>

<p>Having played in Chelsea's pre-season friendly at Brighton on August 29, Kante played a prominent part in France's opening UEFA Nations League games against Sweden and Croatia. The treadmill is moving again.</p>

<p>While the debate over whether Chelsea should sell Kante is a valid one, the reasons why he should remain are more compelling.</p>

<p>Kante's exceptional work in Chelsea's midfield these past few seasons and his unfailing commitment to their cause have made him a firm fan favourite. Few Chelsea fans want to see him leave.</p>

<p>And as the Blues rebuff Conte's wishes for a Kante reunion at Inter, it appears only an exceptional offer - surely in excess of £75m - would persuade them to sell their most industrious player.</p>
