<p>'You're my forever': The Bachelor Nadine Kodsi has proved she's moved on from her short-lived TV heartbreak, as she debuted her new romance on Instagram on Monday</p>

<p>Despite not revealing his identity, Nadine looked smitten as she tightly hugged her other half as he looked out at the waterfront.</p>

<p>'The sun will always shine with you. You're my forever,' she added a gushing caption.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as well as finding love, Nadine has seemed to transform her whole appearance since exiting the show.</p>

<p>In a recent selfie, the brunette sported an oversized pout that looked nothing like her regular-sized lips from The Bachelor.</p>

<p>While some may assume that her pout is the result of fillers, Nadine insists that her plump appearance is down to makeup and filters. </p>

<p>'It's not surgery, they're my lips,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's makeup and filters, but the bigger the better!'</p>

<p>Since leaving The Bachelor mansion, the glamorous Nadine has earned attention for looking like Married At First Sight's Martha Kalifatidis.</p>

<p>The pair have similar features and a passion for fashion, and even share near identical usernames on Instagram.</p>

<p>Lebanese stunner Nadine goes by <?php echo e('@'); ?>nadinee__k on the social media site, while Greek beauty Martha is known as <?php echo e('@'); ?>marthaa__k to her 340,000 followers. </p>

<p>Nadine recently revealed that she has no plans to appear on Bachelor in Paradise - or any other reality show for that matter.</p>

<p>'It's not surgery, they're my lips,' Nadine told Daily Mail Australia. 'It's makeup and filters, but the bigger the better!'</p>

<p>'I have a life outside of The Bachelor,' the 30-year-old told Daily Mail Australia last month when asked if she would consider returning to the franchise. </p>

<p>The brunette beauty, who has a degree in criminology, has since returned to her day job as a fashion entrepreneur.</p>

<p>Nadine has been an outspoken critic of Locky and the entire Bachelor franchise since her exit.</p>

<p>Last month, she called Locky a 'production puppet' after he was seen with the earpiece on the So Dramatic podcast.</p>
