<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The UK economy grew by almost seven per cent in July but Britain's rebound from the coronavirus crisis is slowing down with GDP still almost 12 per cent below pre-lockdown levels. </p>

<p>The Office for National Statistics announced this morning that UK GDP had grown by 6.6 per cent in July - the third consecutive month of growth.</p>

<p>However, the recovery was slightly worse than expected after a consensus of analysts had predicted a 6.8 per cent month-to-month increase while overall GDP remains down 11.7 per cent overall.</p>

<p>Hopes of a swift recovery from the crisis also took a hit as the speed of the bounce back slowed following 8.7 per cent growth which was recorded in June.          </p>

<p>The ONS said the UK has now clawed back around half of the output it lost after the pandemic fully hit the economy.</p>

<p>The UK economy grew by 6.6 per cent in July - the third consecutive month of growth - but lower than the 8.7 per cent recorded in June</p>

<p>Chancellor Rishi Sunak is under pressure from business to bring forward fresh support measures to ensure the economy continues to recover </p>

<p>The statistics body reported growth across all of the major sectors of the British economy, with particularly strong growth in the construction industry.</p>

<p>Construction output jumped by 17.6 per cent in July, driven by an increase in new housing, but still remained 11.6 per cent below the level reported in February.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the production sector reported output seven per cent below pre-Covid levels after it grew by 5.2 per cent in July following an increase in manufacturing.</p>

<p>The services sector increased by 6.1 per cent in July, below analysts' predictions, after restaurants, pubs and cafes were given the green light to welcome customers again. </p>

<p>Darren Morgan, the director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: 'While it has continued steadily on the path towards recovery, the UK economy still has to make up nearly half of the GDP lost since the start of the pandemic.</p>

<p>'Education grew strongly as some children returned to school, while pubs, campsites and hairdressers all saw notable improvements.</p>

<p>'Car sales exceeded pre-crisis levels for the first time, with showrooms having a particularly busy time.</p>

<p>'All areas of manufacturing, particularly distillers and car-makers, saw improvements, while house-building also continued to recover.'</p>

<p>The British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the growth figures but warned that without new Government support there is 'little prospect of a sustained resurgence', especially with the furlough scheme set to end next month. </p>

<p>The BCC's head of economics Suren Thiru said: 'The latest data confirms that UK economic activity continued to pick-up in July as lockdown restrictions eased further.</p>

<p>'The UK economy is currently in a period of temporary calm, with activity buoyed by the government's emergency support measures and the unwinding of pent-up customer demand as more parts of the economy reopened.</p>

<p>The coronavirus lockdown had a devastating impact on the UK economy as it shrunk by more than 20 per cent in the second quarter of 2020 </p>

<p>'However, with many firms continuing to face an unprecedented cash crisis and unemployment likely to surge as the support schemes wind down, there remains little prospect of a sustained resurgence unless substantial action is taken.'</p>

<p>James Smith, research director at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: 'The UK economy continued to rebound over the summer as lockdown restrictions eased.</p>

<p>'But it's the level of activity that matters, which remains hugely down on pre-pandemic levels.</p>

<p>'More worryingly, the rise in Covid cases and return of public health restrictions means we are coming towards the end of the easy economic wins from restarting activity. </p>

<p>'With emergency support to firms and workers being withdrawn, far tougher times lie ahead this autumn.'</p>
