<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Freddie Roach predicts Manny Pacquiao will need just two rounds at most to beat Conor McGregor in their planned high-profile fight next year. </p>

<p>Both Pacquiao and McGregor's camps have claimed this week that a boxing bout between the pair in the Middle East is close to being finalised, which will see the Irish fighter come out of retirement once again. </p>

<p>Pacquiao's coach, Roach believes the 41-year-old will have an easier contest versus McGregor than in his 2009 fight against Ricky Hatton - who he beat in two rounds. </p>

<p> Roach tweeted:  'If this is true, <?php echo e('@'); ?>MannyPacquiao will have an easier time with you <?php echo e('@'); ?>TheNotoriousMMA than when he fought <?php echo e('@'); ?>HitmanHatton' </p>

<p>Pacquiao, who is now a Senator in the Philippines, confirmed he will donate his earnings to victims of the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>A statement from Pacquiao's office read: 'For the sake of all the Filipino Covid-19 victims, Senator Manny Pacquiao will be fighting UFC superstar Conor McGregor next year.' </p>

<p>'The huge portion of his earnings will proceed to those who are affected nationwide by the pandemic.' </p>

<p>Pacquiao took just two rounds to knock out Hatton (above) in the boxing clash 11 years ago</p>

<p>McGregor, meanwhile, released a series of explosive tweets on Friday night detailing the reason behind his decision to walk away from the sport earlier this summer, and even showed private Instagram messages between him and Dana White. </p>

<p>From the messages, which were exchanged back in February, McGregor had asked White to be put on multiple bills or for an event of his own, mentioning Justin Gaethje and Diego Sanchez as possible opponents. </p>

<p>McGregor retired earlier this year after being told he would have to wait for the coronavirus pandemic to end and for fans to be let back into arenas in order to return the ring.</p>

<p>McGregor switched codes back in 2017 when he took on Floyd Mayweather but lost</p>

<p>McGregor and Pacquiao are two of the biggest fighting stars worldwide with the former the first ever UFC champion to hold two belts in different divisions simultaneously and the latter a eight-weight world boxing champion.</p>

<p>Pacquiao last fought in July 2019, defeating Keith Thurman to win the WBA world welterweight title while McGregor obliterated Donald Cerrone in his comeback UFC fight in January. </p>

<p>McGregor has famously switched codes before, when he lost to Floyd Mayweather in a money-spinning boxing fight back in August 2017 and has since regularly spoken about his desire to return to the ring again.</p>
