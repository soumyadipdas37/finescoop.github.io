<p>'Toys play a critical role in families’ lives as they spend more time at home and parents seek ways to keep kids engaged with learning-based play.</p>

<p>'More than any year before, we’re seeing strong interest across toys that stem from digital platforms, like kid influencer-created toys, interactive and educational toys, screen-free indoor entertainment and toys for active outdoor play,' he added. </p>

<p>Their list includes all of these categories, as well as several toys that will only be sold at Walmart.</p>
