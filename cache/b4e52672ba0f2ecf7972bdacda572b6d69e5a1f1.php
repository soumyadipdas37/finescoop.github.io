<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lewis Hamilton was fastest after the second practice session at Monza as the world championship leader geared up for Saturday's qualifying session for the Italian Grand Prix.</p>

<p>Hamilton dominated from start to finish in Spa last weekend to extend his world championship lead over nearest rival Verstappen, and is looking to pick up from where he left off in Belgium with a win at Monza.Â </p>

<p>And the Brit blitzed the second practice session in Italy, clocking in with a fastest lap time of 1:20.192, just under three-tenths quicker than team-mate Valtteri Bottas.Â </p>

<p>Lewis Hamilton emerged as the fastest driver after the second practice session in MonzaÂ </p>

<p>The Brit had been pipped to top spot by Valtteri Bottas after FP1 but blitzed the second sessionÂ </p>

<p>Mercedes driver Bottas got the better of the six-time world champion during the first practice in Italy, with the Finn clocking in a time of 1:20.703 on Friday morning, two-tenths quicker than Hamilton.</p>

<p>The 31-year-old was nowhere near Hamilton last weekend and will be looking to close the gap on the seemingly unstoppable championship leader, who already holds a 50-point advantage over his team-mate after just seven races.Â Â </p>

<p>The first practice session was momentarily called to a halt afterÂ Max VerstappenÂ suffered a crash, with aÂ red flag was displayed after the Dutchman skidded across the Italian track, kicking up dust as he went into the gravel and then a barrier.Â Â </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Max Verstappen returned to the pits with a damaged wing after a crash in FP1Â </p>

<p>The Red Bull driver's front wing took heavy damage as he spun across the track into the gravel</p>

<p>Max in the wall! ðŸ’¥He's gone onto the gravel at the Ascari chicane, with a shunt into the barriers making a mess of his front wing.ðŸ“º Live on Sky Sports F1ðŸ“± Live on the App and Sky GoðŸ’» Live Blog: https://t.co/CkqLNAZAQx#SkyF1 | #F1 | #ItalianGP ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ pic.twitter.com/nwh5SyqIpu</p>

<p>His Red Bull's front wing came off and the youngster was able to get his car back into the garage as the session was called to a stop briefly.Â </p>

<p>Ferrari have endured a poor season thus far, and returned home in desperate need of a shot in the arm after a terrible race in Spa, with both Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc finishing outside the points.Â </p>

<p>However, indications from the first practice session show it may be another tricky weekend for The Prancing Horse, with last year's race winner Leclerc 11th-fastest with a time of 1:21.904, while Vettel was all the way down in 19th, over two seconds slower than Bottas.Â </p>

<p>Ferrari's woes continued as Sebastian Vettel finished FP1 with the 19th-quickest lap time</p>

<p>The German managed to progress up to 12th after FP2 while Leclerc moved to ninth ahead of what is likely to be an uncomfortable day for Ferrari in qualifying on Saturday.Â </p>

<p>This weekend a new FIA directive comes into play, with teams banned from using so-called 'party modes' during qualifying and in the race. It means that engines must be run in a single power mode.Â </p>

<p>The official reasoning is to make it easier for teams to monitor power units, although it has been suggested that the ban has been aimed at Mercedes, who are believed to have the superior peak power mode.Â Â </p>
