<p>Bachelor finalists Bella Varelis (right) and Irena Srbinovska (left) haven't spoken since filming the last rose ceremony two months ago - as an insider says they’re STILL enemies</p>

<p>The Bachelor went into lockdown for about three and a half months, from mid-March until the first week of July, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Once the contestants returned to the mansion, a furious Bella, 25, accused Irena, 31, of lying about the extent of her contact with Locky during self-isolation and called her a 'manipulative little b***h' that she no longer trusted.</p>

<p>The mystery source added that 'jealousy escalated tenfold' on the set between the two ladies, and the friendship was beyond repair.</p>

<p>Irena was previously quoted by the publication as saying her friendship with Bella was 'a disaster waiting to happen'.  </p>

<p>'They're not friends, and never will be': The inside source claimed Bella (left) had no intentions of mending fences with Irena (right) as she still felt 'betrayed' by the nurse's alleged behaviour</p>

<p>An on-set source previously told Daily Mail Australia that Bella was under the impression that Locky was only having 'lengthy' phone and SMS chats with her in lockdown, when he was in fact having similar contact with several girls.</p>

<p>'The real reason they fell out was that Bella couldn't accept the fact that Irena had also formed a close connection with Locky during lockdown.</p>

<p>'She was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close.' </p>

<p>Jealous: During the cocktail party, which was filmed in early July, Bella accused Irena of lying about her communication with Bachelor Locky Gilbert while the cast was in lockdown</p>

<p>Reality check: '[Bella] was furious when she found out multiple girls were talking to Locky on a daily basis - but she took it out on Irena because they were so close,' a source said</p>

<p>Bella recently told New Idea magazine that the increasing competition in the house made it difficult to maintain her friendship with Irena.</p>

<p>'I knew she had a good connection with Locky, too. I loved seeing [Irena] come back from her date happy, but seeing her happy made me realise that my connection with Locky may be worse off,' she said.</p>

<p>The marketing consultant also told TV Week she didn't regret confronting Irena, and was glad they were no longer friends.</p>

<p>Bella is widely believed to be the heartbroken runner-up and Irena is tipped to win, according to betting agencies TAB and Sportsbet.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday from 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>
