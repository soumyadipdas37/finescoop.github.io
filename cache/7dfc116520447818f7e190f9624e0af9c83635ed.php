<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The early days of Jurgen Klopp's tenure as Liverpool manager were defined by his full-throttle football. Outrunning opponents, squeezing defences and overpowering their opponents were the spine of the club's resurgence under the German.</p>

<p>Klopp's heavy-metal style propelled Liverpool back up the Premier League table and laid the groundwork for what was to come but it couldn't bring long term success.</p>

<p>For all their attacking verve and frenetic energy, there were still weakness at the back and fears they could be caught out by teams sitting deep and hitting them on the break. </p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara will bring something completely different to Liverpool this season </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp has tailored his style in the last two years to turn the Reds into a winning machine</p>

<p>Getting back into the Champions League at the end of 2016-17 was huge for Klopp's reign and taking his side to the final in Kiev 12 months later showed remarkable and rapid progress.</p>

<p>But in order to be successful and become genuine, long-term challengers for both the Premier League and Champions League, Klopp knew some tweaks had to be made.</p>

<p>Changes to the system became noticeable at the start of 2018-19 when Liverpool embarked on a stunning period of form that took them to the summit of European and domestic football.</p>

<p>There is now a patience to Liverpool's play and they have developed an ability to methodically dismantle teams over 90 minutes, rather than go for the jugular in the first 20.</p>

<p>Make no mistake about it, Liverpool can still steamroll somebody if they want. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson still fly forward and the famed front three are just as menacing as ever.</p>

<p>None of Liverpool's current midfield options have the passing range and intricacy of Thiago</p>

<p>But subtle changes to Klopp's 4-3-3 and the ability to control every area of a match have allowed his side to blow almost everybody away over the past two seasons. </p>

<p>Signing Thiago will only enhance this dimension of Liverpool's system.</p>

<p>Klopp is even more wary this season of teams sitting deep and focusing on defence when they play Liverpool. Although Leeds scored four at Anfield last week, they will be one of very few teams who come out all guns blazing.</p>

<p>It is a boost then that they have recruited a forward-thinking midfielder who can unlock the sternest of defences.</p>

<p>Thiago is a maestro on the ball and can play almost every pass in the book, offering something different to Klopp's existing midfield options.</p>

<p>Jordan Henderson (L) and Georginio Wijnaldum (R) have some new competition in midfield</p>

<p>Fabinho, Jordan Henderson, Georginio Wijnaldum and James Milner are all cut from a similar cloth.</p>

<p>It would be harsh to dismiss their technical ability and cast them off as workhorses who strangle opposition midfields but none of them have so far shown they offer the same intricacy in their passing and attacking play as Thiago.</p>

<p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Naby Keita are more attack-minded but are yet to put together a full season without injuries for Liverpool. </p>

<p>First linked with a move to Anfield at the start of the summer, Thiago's performances in Bayern's successful Champions League campaign left fans purring.</p>

<p>He showed his ability to control and dictate the tempo of games, playing alongside Leon Goretzka in a midfield duo that squashed Barcelona 8-2 and then beat Lyon and PSG to claim Bayern's first European title since 2013.</p>

<p>Thiago showed in Bayern Munich's successful Champions League campaign how good he is</p>

<p>Thiago won seven Bundesligas in Munich as well as the European Cup, but is now set to leave</p>

<p>Liverpool have been know to sometimes play a narrow 4-4-2 in some games and Thiago would fit in the middle two perfectly.</p>

<p>Goretzka proved himself to be a perfect partner, charging up and down the pitch to allow his team-mate the time on the ball to dictate and he will not have to look far to find someone willing to do the same at Anfield.</p>

<p>There is also a thought that signing Thiago will mean Liverpool do not need to bring in a new centre back, despite the departure of Dejan Lovren, because his addition will allow Fabinho to act as cover in defence.</p>

<p>Thiago can drop into the deeper role of a midfield trio with ease, proving to be an asset to Liverpool's squad depth as well.</p>

<p>A quick look on YouTube shows the sort of forward-thinking passer Thiago is and Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane will be licking their lips at the service he can provide.</p>

<p>Mohamed Salah (L) and Sadio Mane (R) will be licking their lips at the service Thiago can give</p>

<p>Thiago is not as young as a typical Liverpool signing but still offers tremendous value </p>

<p>Pep Guardiola bought Thiago to Bavaria when he took over at Bayern in 2013 and now faces the realistic prospect of his golden boy denying Manchester City another title this season.</p>

<p>Wayne Rooney recently commented that Liverpool getting Thiago would be a better signing than Lionel Messi moving to City when the Argentine was unsuccessfully trying to work his way out of Barcelona.</p>

<p>That, from someone to have played against both, shows the calibre of player Klopp and Sporting Director Michael Edwards have recruited.</p>

<p>While it seemed impossible last season as they blew everybody away in the Premier League, Liverpool have found a player who can take them to another level.</p>
