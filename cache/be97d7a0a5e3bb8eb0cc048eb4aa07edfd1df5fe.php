<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool have won 196 points across the last two Premier League campaigns, losing just five times in the process and, outside of that streak, also winning the Champions League </p>

<p>And if that isn't momentous enough as a feat, two of those defeats came in what were essentially dead rubbers for Jurgen Klopp's side - Arsenal and Manchester City beat them after they had already sealed a momentous league triumph, Liverpool's first in 30 years. </p>

<p>It is a mistake to think Liverpool's lack of action in the transfer market this summer paves the way for them to surrender their crown. They had the league wrapped up last season with six games to go and a margin of 18 points does not dissolve easily.</p>

<p>But from newboys Leeds, Liverpool's opponents in their season opener on Saturday, to their nearest rivals in City, how can Premier League sides stop Klopp's men? Sportsmail makes an assessment.</p>

<p>Liverpool begin their Premier League title defence on Saturday against newcomers Leeds</p>

<p>Firstly, as simple as it sounds, teams have to be prepared to run as much as Liverpool do. Liverpool's two matches against Atletico Madrid last season, where Diego Simeone's side eliminated the then Champions League holders 4-2 on aggregate, winning both games, is a case in point.</p>

<p>Atletico are notorious grafters but to outstretch Liverpool the way that they did was remarkable. In the first leg, a 1-0 win for the Spaniards, they ran 113.2km compared to Liverpool's 107.8km.</p>

<p>In the return leg at Anfield, Atletico outran Liverpool by 3.6km, covering an epic 151.1km to the 147.5 of the Reds - those stats, of course, include 30 minutes of extra time.</p>

<p>A slender 1-0 win in the first leg was backed up by an impressive 3-2 win at Anfield in the second. Granted, there were other factors at play - Alisson was injured for the second match - but a basic requirement of getting something off Liverpool is a sky-high work rate.</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp's side have only lost five matches across the last two Premier League seasons</p>

<p>When Watford inflicted Liverpool's first league defeat of last season upon them in February at Vicarage Road, they utilized a very simple but strong tactic; target Virgil van Dijk's partner.</p>

<p>Troy Deeney and co were helped immeasurably by the fact it was Dejan Lovren on that day, rather than Joe Gomez or Joel Matip. It was Lovren's first game in over a month and turned out to be his penultimate appearance in a red shirt.</p>

<p>Gomez and Matip are no fools - Matip starred in Liverpool's run to Champions League glory and was arguably better than Van Dijk in the 2-0 final victory over Tottenham but week-to-week, they are more fallible than the Dutchman. Gomez struggled in Liverpool's 4-0 defeat by City as well and conceded the penalty that allowed Keven de Bruyne to open the scoring.</p>

<p>Klopp's central defenders of Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez are Liverpool's vital axis</p>

<p>When Dejan Lovren played ahead of Gomez against Watford, Liverpool were beaten 3-0</p>

<p>It was clear that Tory Deeney (right) targeted Lovren, who lacking match sharpness</p>

<p>As it stands, Liverpool are yet to replace Lovren with a fourth-choice central defender and it remains to be seen if Klopp is going to fill that void with a youngster in his squad.</p>

<p>Ki-Jana Hoever is highly at Anfield but Klopp has hinted before that he sees his as a full-back in the long term. Sepp van den Berg and Billy Koumetio are also options, while Fabinho has also played there before. </p>

<p>Fabinho's role as a defensive midfielder is imperative in the setup of Klopp's Liverpool - he can drop in as a third central defender when Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson push forward, as they often spend so much time doing.</p>

<p>Ki-Jana Hoever (left) and Billy Koumetio are options for Klopp as a fourth-choice defender </p>

<p>Speaking of the two full-backs, clubs also succeed when forcing them back, especially Alexander-Arnold.</p>

<p>Atletico managed to pin him into a more conventional right-back position in the first-leg of their Champions League knock-out clash with Liverpool, which they won 1-0. </p>

<p>Both he and Robertson are absolutely integral to Liverpool's attacking play - the right back provided 13 assists last season while the Scotland star laid on 12.</p>

<p>If their attacking instincts are curbed, then the forward runs they make are not creating space for the front three of Mane, Salah and Firmino to exploit. In turn, it's two less players for an opposing defence to worry about, although that front three are still perfectly adept at winning games on their own.</p>

<p>Diego Simeone's side also did a fantastic job of stopping Trent Alexander-Arnold attacking</p>

<p>Another area where Atletico succeeded was disjointing the Liverpool attack. In that very same first leg clash, they stopped Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino exchanging a single pass before Salah was taken off with 15 minutes to go. </p>

<p>The result of this? Liverpool didn't muster a single shot on goal in the match. Sadio Mane was also withdrawn at half-time as Klopp feared his hotheadedness could lead to a red card.</p>

<p>When Liverpool lost to Atletico Madrid, Mohamed Salah was an isolated figure in attack</p>

<p>Roberto Firmino didn't manage to complete one pass to Salah in the first leg in Spain </p>

<p>Of course, not all teams have the nous of Simeone's Atletico throughout the Premier League - opponents of their calibre are rare. </p>

<p>But in Liverpool's two most competitive defeats this year, from Watford to Atletico, there are chinks in the armour of Klopp's men.</p>

<p>Marcelo Bielsa, the Leeds manager associated with a particularly fastidious approach to match preparation, will only be too aware of these aspects of Liverpool's play. It will be fascinating to see if he exposes another flaw in the line-up of the Premier League champions. </p>
