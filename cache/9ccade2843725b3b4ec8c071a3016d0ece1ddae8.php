<p>Bloomberg spotted at least a dozen phones connected to branches outside a location in Chicago.</p>

<p>The devices belong to contractors of the Amazon Flex app, which chooses drivers to carry out deliveries based on proximity to the grocery store – giving those with a device in the tree first dibs at a new order.</p>

<p>There are a handful of drivers in on the scheme, as multiple devices will receive the same alert making it difficult for the tech giant to uncover the system, sources said.</p>

<p>Amazon drivers have devised a plan to increases their chances of grabbing new delivery orders at a Whole Foods Store – hanging smartphones in trees. Bloomberg spotted at least a dozen phones connected to branches outside a location in Chicago</p>

<p>DailyMail.com has reached out to Amazon for comment and has yet to receive a response.</p>

<p>Some may look at this setup as cheating, but many drivers have been laid off as the coronavirus has kept Americans home for months – Uber laid off 3,700 in June alone.</p>

<p>And many have turned to Amazon Flex to generate an income.</p>

<p>Amazon advertises the job as an opportunity to 'be your own boss' with drivers able to clock on and off whenever they please - and drives can make $18 to $25 an hour.</p>

<p>Contractors wait for a new delivery to go through the app, accept it and deliver it to the customer's destination withing 14 to 45 minutes. </p>

<p>This service, however requires them to accept the new order immediately or someone else may snatch it.</p>

<p>Drivers told Bloomberg that the phones in the trees coordinate as one device that dispatches delivery routes to multiple drivers in the surrounding location.</p>

<p>These Amazon Flex workers who have seen the setup in the past believe there is someone acting as an intermediary between Amazon and the drivers, which is charging them a fee to obtain more deliveries – a process that is against Amazon's policies.</p>

<p>Chetan Sharma, a wireless industry consultant, told Bloomberg that the 'perpetrators' are using these phones in the tree to spread around work to a number of Amazon Flex apps, in a bid to slide under Amazon's radar.</p>

<p>'They're gaming the system in a way that makes it harder for Amazon to figure it out,' Sharma said. 'They're just a step ahead of Amazon's algorithm and its developers.'</p>

<p>A person familiar with the matter said that the plan helps those without a license still make deliveries and get paid doing so.</p>

<p>Those working for Amazon Flex typically make $18 hour, so someone else can pay a third person $10 an hour to take the route and still make a small profit on the side.</p>

<p>However, a Flex driver who has been observing the smartphone in the tree trick said Amazon is well aware of the activity, 'but does nothing.'</p>
