<p>Suave spy: Daniel wore a dark blue jumper that he teamed with a white shirt and a pair of black trousers as he went out on his mission</p>

<p>A new action-packed trailer for the film was released earlier this month, and saw the spy risk is life when back in the field. </p>

<p>In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and the US on November 20.</p>

<p>The film, directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga, was originally scheduled for release in April, but was pushed back to November 25 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, and was then brought forward to November 8 before the most recent change.</p>

<p>In the summer, it was reported that the film's release date was set to change once again, after the COVID-19 crisis led the launch to be delayed by seven months.  </p>

<p>According to a report from The Sun, it was being considered whether the film's release should be moved yet again over fears of losing money at the box office.</p>

<p>It was claimed that the continued increase in COVID-19 cases in the US meant film executives were concerned about how many people would be able to see it.  </p>

<p>Back in action: Teasing whats to come for Bond, the caption said: 'The mission that changes everything. The new poster for <?php echo e('@'); ?>007 is here. In cinemas this November'</p>

<p>Preview: A new action-packed trailer for the film was released earlier this month, and teased Bond risking his life as he returned to the field</p>

<p>A source told the publication: 'There are secret talks about what to do. Having No Time To Die earning less than half a billion would be deemed a disaster no matter the circumstances.'</p>

<p>MailOnline contacted EON productions for comment at the time. </p>

<p>The upcoming movie will mark Daniel's last-ever outing as the iconic character, which the actor recently insisted he was 'fine' about.</p>

<p>Soon: In June it was confirmed that the release date for the anticipated film had been moved forward by two weeks and will open in the UK on November 12 and November 20 in the US </p>

<p>Look away now! The film sees Bond come to grips with villain Safin, portrayed by Rami Malek, 39, who viewers were told is concocting a plan that could kill 'millions' </p>

<p>He told British GQ: 'I'm really... I'm OK. I don't think I would have been if I'd done the last film and that had been it. But this, I'm like... Let's go. Let's get on with it. I'm fine.'</p>

<p>The actor also insisted he isn't too worried about his post-Bond career, as he claimed: 'I'm pretty sure I can play just about anything. Yeah. I'm pretty sure I can, or at least I can make a f**king good fist of it.'</p>

<p>No Time To Die is co-written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge who was brought on board to sprinkle magic on the script for the 25th movie in the franchise based on Ian Fleming's hit novels.</p>

<p>Trying to save him: In the trailer, 007 is told of the danger Safin presents by Madeleine (Lea Seydoux), who tells him that he is after 'revenge'</p>

<p>Meeting his match: '00' agent Nomi (Lashana Lynch) was also clearly a force to be reckoned with as Bond refers to her as a 'disarming young woman' after she attempts to shoot him</p>
