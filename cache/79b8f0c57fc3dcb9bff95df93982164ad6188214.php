<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris ended up mistakenly referring to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as the 'Notorious B.I.G.' during a speech on Monday.</p>

<p>'She was part of our culture,' Harris said. 'Yes, we wear those Notorious B.I.G. t-shirts with a lot of pride, but since she passed, there are parents reminding their children that she helped their lives.' </p>

<p>The California senator had been attempting to refer to Ginsburg's nickname, frequently used in pop culture and even branded upon items of clothing as 'The Notorious RBG'. </p>

<p>The moniker was seen as a compliment and a sign of Ginsburg's tenacity and grit.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris referred to the late Supreme Court Justica Ruth Bader Ginsberg as 'Notorious BIG' instead of her moniker 'Notorious RBG'</p>

<p>The late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was popular among younger people who came up with a moniker and fashion line for her - 'Notorious RBG' based on the Brooklyn rapper</p>

<p>A t-shirt left behind at a memorial in front of the U.S. Supreme Court building featured a picture of Ginsburg and her nickname, 'Notorious RBG,' in reference to the Brooklyn rapper</p>

<p>A reporter noted that Harris's prepared remarks actually referred to RBG instead of BIG. She also posted a selection for RBG items showcasing the justice's popularity</p>

<p>Many people on Twitter came down hard on the Senator and Vice Presidential candidate</p>

<p>Christopher George Latore Wallace, better known by his stage names The Notorious B.I.G. and Biggie Smalls, was shot in his car by an unknown assailant in March 1997 at the age of 24. </p>

<p>Harris, who is Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's running mate, made the remarks during a speech in which she was specifically commenting on Trump's appointment of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court. </p>

<p>Harris's prepared remarks did state 'Notorious RBG' so it is unclear why she made such an error. </p>

<p>Twitter users came down hard on the California Senator with some accusing her of trying too hard to appeal to younger voters.</p>

<p>'People under 50 already know this... they're pointing out Kamala's try-hard nature when it comes to "being down with the fellow kids",' wrote one.</p>

<p>'Some of the Biden dementia rubbing off on her I see,' added another in a cutting tweet.</p>

<p>'First she thinks Tupac is still alive. Now this. Are we sure Sen. Harris is a person of color?' joked another. </p>

<p>Ginsburg's daughter-in-law Patrice Michaels wrote composed and performed in a show called 'Notorious RBG in Song' at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in 2019.</p>

<p>Kamala Harris named Tupac the 'best rapper alive', 24 years after he was shot dead in a Las Vegas drive-by in an interview with CNN's Angela Rye at the NAACP's virtual convention Friday</p>

<p>Harris hasn't had much luck with rappers in recent days.</p>

<p>On Friday, she mistakenly named Tupac the 'best rapper alive', 24 years after he was shot dead in a Las Vegas drive-by.  </p>

<p>The Democratic vice presidential candidate made the gaffe during an interview with CNN's Angela Rye at the NAACP's virtual convention, sending social media users into overdrive and fueling fresh debate around the 'Tupac Lives' conspiracy. </p>

<p>Tupac Shakur (pictured) was shot dead in a drive-by in Las Vegas on September 7 1996. Wild conspiracy theories have circulated for years that he is still alive</p>

<p>'Best rapper alive?' Rye asked Harris in the videoconference interview. </p>

<p>Harris paused for a second and answered: 'Tupac.'  </p>

<p>Hip hop star Tupac Shakur was shot multiple times in a car on the night of September 7 1996 after he had gone to a Mike Tyson boxing match at the MGM Grand.</p>

<p>Tupac, former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight and his bodyguards got into a fight with a member of the notorious Crips gang in the casino lobby.</p>

<p>Soon after, Tupac and Knight were in a car stopped at a traffic light when a white Cadillac pulled up alongside them and shot into the car. </p>

<p>Tupac was shot four times in the arm, thigh and chest and died in hospital aged 25. </p>

<p>No one was ever charged for his murder. </p>

<p>Tupac was gunned down, just months before Biggie. Both murders of two of hip hop's most influential stars remain unsolved. </p>

<p>Social media users went into overdrive after Harris' slip-up sparking fresh debate that the hip hop star faked his own death</p>

<p>Others slammed Harris for feigning interest in rap to try to connect with black voters</p>
