<p>Supporting mum: Victoria Beckham may have had to ditch her usual LFW catwalk show in favour of a digital presentation, but she had her number one fan by her side - daughter Harper</p>

<p>The designer is showing off her latest collection with the help of four models, while there was just a handful of fashion editors in attendance for a preview at Victoria Miro art gallery in East London on Sunday.</p>

<p>Guests at Sunday's preview all wore monogrammed face masks that were provided at the entrance  of the gallery and social distancing was enforced. </p>

<p>The presentation will be streamed on Victoria's website on Monday afternoon, meaning one of LFW's most anticipated shows will be accessible to all. </p>

<p>Changes: Victoria, like most designers, has opted for a digital presentation to showcase her latest collection during London Fashion Week </p>

<p>Sharing a video of the dress on her Stories, Victoria explained: 'It's the same print and fabric as the dress from our last pre-collection. I have to say she looks absolutely incredible, it's such a pretty print.' </p>

<p>Sweet: The Spice Girl turned fashion designer shared an Instagram photo of her daughter Harper, nine, dressed in a mini version of one of her dresses with a matching face mask</p>

<p>Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons as well as eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz.</p>

<p>Speaking to Grazia Victoria explained that she spent a lot of time over lockdown wondering how she was going to present the collection. </p>

<p>She at first thought she would show the collection with a small presentation to just editors, before making a last minute decision to go digital and open up the LFW event to everyone. </p>

<p>'There is obviously more pressure on digital content — the video that we’re going to be shooting today, the pictures that we take. … I think that the challenge this season has been less about the clothes and more about everything else. I always welcome change and challenge,' Victoria said. </p>

<p>Family love: Victoria also shared photos of the beautiful bouquets of flowers sent by her husband David and their sons</p>

<p>Love:  She also receoved a bouquet of roses from eldest son Brooklyn's fiancée Nicola Peltz alongside a sweet note</p>

<p>'When I look at the business and how Covid-19 has affected business —people are buying clothes online. My online business is doing very well. Again it reiterates the importance of digital and making sure the customers get that content. It’s a different kind of pressure this season.'</p>

<p>She added that she enjoyed the designing process immensely, explaining: 'It’s a smaller collection and I can honestly say working on this collection has reminded me why I fell in love with fashion in the first place. I’ve enjoyed the limitations, I really have.'</p>

<p>'We created the pre-collection in the back garden. We all had to work remotely and there was an element of that which was nice, being home with David and children and having quality time. But for me I like to be with my team I like to be with the fabrics. I’ve really become really close to my team through this whole process.'</p>
