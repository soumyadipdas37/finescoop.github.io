<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea confirmed the signing of Bayer Leverkusen Kai Havertz on Friday night - but spelt the player's name wrong in the transfer announcement.</p>

<p>The Blues signed the 21-year-old forward for a fee believed to be around £89million in total to take their summer spending to around £230million. </p>

<p>But the west London club's media team forgot to use their spell check as they called the German international 'Kia' instead of 'Kai' on their official website.</p>

<p>Chelsea completed the signing of £89million-rated striker Kai Havertz on Friday night </p>

<p>But the Blues managed to call their new star forward 'Kia' instead of 'Kai' on their club website</p>

<p>The statement read: 'The Blues have completed the signing of our second German international this summer with Kia Havertz putting his signature on a five-year contract'. </p>

<p>Chelsea's interest in Havertz has been long-standing, with the negotiations of the deal drawn out across the entire summer transfer window so far. </p>

<p>The announcement of the German international's new club would have been planned for weeks by the Chelsea media team but they still managed to let the error slip through.  </p>

<p>Other parts of the Havertz reveal showed him holding the Chelsea shirt alongside head coach Frank Lampard at Stamford Bridge as the player switches Germany for England. </p>

<p>Chelsea fans noticed the blunder on social media, though the majority of the Blues supporters poked fun at the situation. </p>

<p>One user said: 'Can't wait for Kia Havertz to play alongside Honda Ziyech, Chevrolet Pulisic and Tesla Werner'</p>

<p>Another tweeted: Kia Havertz?!?!?! Seriously <?php echo e('@'); ?>ChelseaFC?!?! C’mon man.'</p>

<p>One supporter asked: 'Who's Kai??? Chelsea just signed Kia Havertz. Probably a sponsorship deal with the car company Kia Motors' </p>

<p>Chelsea fans and other football fans poked fun of the spelling blunder on social media</p>

<p>Havertz becomes Chelsea's sixth major signing of an incredible transfer window, which has also seen RB Leipzig forward and fellow Germany international Timo Werner also come through the door.</p>

<p>Ajax winger Hakim Ziyech also arrived earlier this year while defenders Thiago Silva, Ben Chilwell and Malang Sarr have also joined the west Londoners.</p>

<p>Upon signing for the Blues, Havertz said: 'I am very happy and proud to be here. For me it is a dream come true to play in a big club like Chelsea and I can't wait to meet all the players and the trainers. Yeah, I am very happy to be here!'  </p>
