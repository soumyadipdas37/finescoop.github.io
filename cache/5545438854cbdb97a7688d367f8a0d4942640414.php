<p>Posed: The 34-year-old Canadian didn't wear a face covering as required in California due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic although she was pictured carrying one in her hand</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Williams revealed she and her husband of three years are thinking about starting a family together.</p>

<p>She told DailyMail.com exclusively that they have been talking about having children for 'years' and can't wait to see 'mini Nicoles and Larrys' running around. </p>

<p>'We’re getting closer to pulling the trigger,' she said, adding she hopes they will welcome a child 'hopefully sooner than later'.</p>

<p>The next step: Nicole Williams has been married to retired footballer English since 2017 and she said recently they hope to start a family 'sooner than later'</p>

<p>In the meantime, the couple are content with their two French Bulldogs for company. </p>

<p>'Jasmine is my first born, she’s seven and the sweetest thing you’ve ever seen. She LOVES to eat, is super smart and loves to boss her brother around,' Williams said.</p>

<p>'Ace is my boy, he’s six and we adopted him from the Chicago French Bulldog Rescue. Fun fact is that he was living with his foster family in Aurora and that is also where Larry is from! So both of my boys are from the same city!'</p>

<p>The reality TV star admitted: 'They are probably the reason we do not have real human babies yet, we treat them like they are human, they even have car seats in the car! We love them so much.'</p>

<p>Fur babies: For now, the couple are content to be parents to French Bulldogs Jasmine, seven, and Ace, six</p>
