<p>Amy Connor, 23, was staying at the Ibiza Rockets Hotel in the resort of San Antonio, where her body was found by her sibling, Toni, 26</p>

<p>Toni told Belfast Live: 'We had been down to the pool and then came back up to the room for a while, so Amy got into the shower and then got into bed.</p>

<p>'I went and sat out on the balcony and ate some crisps and chilled and when I came back in, she was still in the bed. </p>

<p>'It was so surreal, it didn't make sense. It was just such a shock.'</p>

<p>Ms Connor's funeral takes place in Belfast today.  </p>
