<p>Fred and Peter Done will make £172million from their 6 per cent stake in the bookmaker, if a takeover by US group Caesars Entertainment goes ahead.</p>

<p>But the pair, who are the founders of rival gambling firm Betfred, may also be poised to snap up William Hill’s betting shops.</p>

<p>Fred (pictured) and Peter Done, the founders of gambling firm Betfred, may be poised to snap up William Hill’s betting shops if a takeover by US group Caesars Entertainment goes ahead</p>

<p>Caesars made it clear this week it was buying William Hill for its rapidly growing US business and had little interest in the rest of the business. </p>

<p>The US firm said it would ‘seek suitable partners or owners’ for the other assets, including the UK business that includes 1,400 High Street bookies.</p>

<p>The Done brothers, who are together worth an estimated £1.3billion, have reportedly expressed an interest in buying the shops, to boost Betfred’s portfolio of 1,500.</p>

<p>At the same time, analysts have said William Hill boss Ulrik Bengtsson would be an obvious candidate to lead a buyout of the UK business including the online operations, which were recently merged with the retail operation.</p>

<p>Private equity companies are also thought to be circling the non-US business.</p>

<p>Caesars’ bid emerged after it was reported the company was in a battle with private equity firm Apollo to buy William Hill. </p>

<p>It has offered 272p per share – or £2.9billion – for the British business and claims its bid is the preferred one.</p>

<p>A spokesman for William Hill declined to comment yesterday.</p>
