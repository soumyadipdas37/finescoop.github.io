<p>Harry Maguire will remain Manchester United's captain despite his Greece incident last month</p>

<p>United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has praised the character of his captain Maguire </p>

<p>Maguire has appealed the verdict and there will be a full retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>But while Maguire was dropped from the England squad by manager Gareth Southgate for last week's internationals, his status as United captain will not change.</p>

<p>Manager Solskjaer told United's official website: 'Of course Harry had a difficult summer.</p>

<p>'He didn't have a long break. His break was different to others as we gave him a few more days and, after, he's come back and looked fine.</p>

<p>'He's handled it really well and, of course, I'll be here to support him.</p>

<p>'He is going to be our captain. We'll just leave Harry and his people and the process to run.</p>

<p>Maguire was given a 21-month suspended sentence on the Greek island of Syros last month</p>

<p>Maguire's legal team successfully appealed the verdict and a re-trial will be held at a later date</p>

<p>'For me, he is a top, an absolute top, human being and has always been a positive guy with the right values.</p>

<p>'So I really hope we can see Harry performing at his best.'</p>

<p>The centre-back played every minute of United's Premier League campaign last season as well as making 17 appearances in other competitions.</p>
