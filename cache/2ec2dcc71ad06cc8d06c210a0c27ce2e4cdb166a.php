<p>Turning heads: Katie Waissel took time off from mummy duties as she headed out for dinner in Radlett on Wednesday evening</p>

<p>Katie, who has lost a staggering two stone, showed off her toned figure in the plunging bralet and flared trousers which featured pleated detailing.</p>

<p>She complemented the look with a black clutch bag and wore her brunette tresses in a swept-over side parting. </p>

<p> Katie appeared in high spirits as she strutted to the Broadwalk for dinner. </p>

<p>Toned: The former X Factor star, 34, cut a glamorous figure in a khaki polka dot co-ord which showed off her washboard abs</p>

<p>Strutting her stuff: Katie, who has lost a staggering two stone, showed off her toned figure in the plunging bralet and flared trousers which featured pleated detailing</p>

<p>Katie's outing comes after she told Closer last month that she wants baby number two to have the same DNA as Hudson, so wants to share him with her fitness trainer ex Andy Speer. </p>

<p>She said: 'I would love to have another baby, but I would like them to be Hudson's full DNA. Andy and I have joked about it many times and I've said to just FedEx it over.' </p>

<p>Andy lives in America and Katie moved back to the UK after the split and she admitted it's taken time for herself and Andy to be amicable again.   </p>

<p>Katie overhauled her lifestyle after giving birth and dropped two stone after adopting an intense exercise plan and is at a healthy BMI for her weight.  </p>

<p>But she said her transformation has led cruel trolls to comment on her appearance. </p>

<p>She said: 'The amount of people who were commenting about my body, saying things like "you look too skinny, you look old, you look like a man, you've got no boobs", it was horrible.  </p>

<p>'But this is my body, I'm not surgically enhanced. I've not injected fat into my thighs or bum and boobs... but I'm so proud of my body - it grew my son and I'm proud of my four-inch long nipples because they breastfed my son for a year.' </p>

<p>Katie said she is ready to meet someone new after an unlucky time in her private life. </p>

<p>She has been married twice before, to model Brad Alphonso in 2012 and to comedian Brian Moote in 2015. </p>

<p>Former flame: The mother-of-one welcomed her son Hudson in July 2018 as a single parent, after splitting with boyfriend Andy (pictured) when she was eight months pregnant</p>
