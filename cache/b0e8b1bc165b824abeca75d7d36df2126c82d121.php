<p>And now Nadine Kodsi is back at it again, this time claiming to know who the final two women in Locky Gilbert's season are. </p>

<p>In a lengthy Instagram post, the 30-year-old said that Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska will make it to the end of the show.</p>

<p>REVEALED: Rogue Bachelor star Nadine Kodsi (pictured) has revealed who will make it to the final two on Locky Gilbert's season </p>

<p>The criminologist admitted that she wasn't completely sure which of the two will win, despite previously stating on the So Dramatic podcast that Bella was the winner.</p>

<p>'I was told by several people that Bella wins,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Remember I was only in the house for a short period of time, all my information has come from girls who were in there longer and from group chats.</p>

<p>Terrific two: In a lengthy Instagram post, the 30-year-old said that Bella Varelis (right) and Irena Srbinovska (left) will make it to the end of the show</p>

<p>'I did however state that it is between Irena and Bella. They are def top two. However, who actually wins 100% I can not possibly predict that as I am not god,' she continued.</p>

<p>'From what I have been told it’s Bella. So please if you’re going to place bets, gamble responsible as I don’t want to be the blame for anyone losing money.'</p>

<p>Nadine added: 'And as I have said to all people who are betting, I would bet on both evenly to be safe.'</p>

<p>'I was told by several people that Bella wins': Nadine believes that Bella will be the last woman standing </p>

<p>It's been widely reported in the media that Bella and Irena are the final two, with Sportsbet betting odds also reflecting this.</p>

<p>Nurse Irena is currently the favourite to win, with 1.50 to Bella's 3.50 on Sportsbet.</p>

<p>As previous seasons of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette have shown, betting odds are rarely wrong when it comes to predicting the winner. </p>

<p>Winner? Nurse Irena is currently the favourite to win, with 1.50 to Bella's 3.50 on Sportsbet</p>

<p>As the odds continue to swing in Irena's favour with each passing episode, it is looking more likely that Bella will be the heartbroken runner-up.</p>

<p>Interestingly, before The Bachelor premiere on August 12, she and Irena had been TAB's joint favourites to win, with odds of $2.50 each.</p>

<p>It wasn't until after the first episodes went to air that Irena emerged as the clear favourite and Bella's odds started to lengthen.</p>

<p>All smiles: Locky's season of The Bachelor is currently airing on Channel 10 </p>
