<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bacteria can survive for up to three years in space, according to scientists who studied colonies of microbes outside the International Space Station. </p>

<p>Researchers responsible for the Japanese Tanpopo experiment on the ISS say the discovery means alien life could hop between neighbouring planets.  </p>

<p>Colonies of microbes at least 0.02 inches thick - thinner than a piece of paper - are resistant to the extreme cold and high radiation levels in space, researchers found. </p>

<p>Only those at the surface of the colony die - they sacrifice themselves and form a protective layer for the remaining microbes underneath. </p>

<p>The discovery means these colonies of microbes could travel between Earth and Mars or any other part of the universe by gathering into 'aggregates' of particles.</p>

<p>The finding is based on 'exposure panels' of a type of bacteria called Deinococcus that were placed outside the International Space Station for up to three years.</p>

<p>Researchers responsible for the Japanese Tanpopo experiment on the ISS say the discovery means alien life could be common - hopping from planet-to-planet</p>

<p>This new discovery backs a theory called 'panspermia' - the controversial idea states that organisms migrate between planets, moons and solar systems.</p>

<p>Dr Akihiko Yamagishi, principal investigator of Tanpopo said the origin of life on Earth is the biggest mystery plaguing human beings.</p>

<p>'Scientists can have totally different points of view on the matter,' he said.</p>

<p>'Some think life is very rare and happened only once in the universe, while others think life can happen on every suitable planet.'</p>

<p>Yamagishi said that for panspermia to be possible life must exist much more often than previously thought by astronomers.</p>

<p>Sir Stephen Hawking was a proponent of the panspermia theory.</p>

<p>'Life could spread from planet to planet or from stellar system to stellar system, carried on meteors,' Hawking once said.</p>

<p>It's even been argued this is how life came to exist on Earth, although such claims have been widely criticised.</p>

<p>The purpose of Tanpopo - Japanese for dandelion - is to investigate the possibility of natural inter-planetary transport of microbial life.</p>

<p>Tests took place from 2015 to 2018 on the exterior of the researchers' craft called Kibo - 250 miles above Earth.</p>

<p>They showed microscopic organisms could spark life by multiplying again after finding suitable conditions - at the other side of the universe.</p>

<p>In the study, samples of dried Deinococcus of different sizes were placed in space for one, two or three years. </p>

<p>By the end of the period those at least 0.02 inches thick had survivors but bacteria at the surface died - creating a protective layer to ensure the survival of the colony.</p>

<p>Japanese astronaut Mr. Yugi set up the exposure experiment module ExHAM on the International Space Station to study external bacteria</p>

<p>Using the data at one, two and three years of exposure, it is estimated a pellet thicker than 0.02 inches would have survived for up to 45 years on the ISS.</p>

<p>The design of the experiment enabled the researchers to predict a 0.04 inch thick colony would last up to eight years in outer space.</p>

<p>Dr Yamagishi, of the University of Tokyo, added: 'The results suggest radio-resistant Deinococcus could survive during the travel from Earth to Mars and vice versa - which is several months or years in the shortest orbit.' </p>

<p>Previous research has proved bacteria could survive for a long period when benefitting from the shielding of rock - a phenomenon known as 'lithopanspermia.'</p>

<p>The finding is based on 'exposure panels' of a type of bacteria called Deinococcus that were placed outside the International Space Station</p>

<p>But this is the first long-term study. It raising the possibility of bacteria surviving in aggregates - raising the new concept of 'massapanspermia.'</p>

<p>Two years ago the same team - using an aircraft and scientific balloons - found Deinococcal floating 7.5 miles above Earth.</p>

<p>The bacteria is known to form colonies well over 0.04 inches in diameter and be resistant to environmental hazards like UV radiation.</p>

<p>Now Dr Yamagishi and colleagues have shown they can resist long enough in space to support the possibility of panspermia.</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology. </p>

<p>Panspermia is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe, hitchhiking on comets or meteorites.</p>

<p>Extremophiles, capable of surviving the inhospitable conditions of space, could become trapped in debris that is ejected into space after collisions between asteroids and planets that harbour life.</p>

<p>Panspermia is a theory that suggests life spreads across the known physical universe, hitchhiking on comets or meteorites</p>

<p>These dormant life-forms may then travel for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets.</p>

<p>One argument that supports the panspermia theory is the emergence of life soon after the heavy bombardment period of earth, between 4 and 3.8 billion years ago. </p>

<p>During this period, researchers believe the Earth endured an extended and very powerful series of meteor showers. </p>

<p>However, the earliest evidence for life on Earth suggests it was present some 3.83 billion years ago, overlapping with this bombardment phase. </p>

<p>These observations suggest that living things during this period would have faced extinction, contributing to the idea that life did not originate on Earth. </p>

<p>The idea of directed panspermia suggests lifeforms were deliberately sent out through the universe by intelligent civilisations.</p>

<p>Professor Francis Crick, one of the biologists who discovered the structure of DNA, examined the possibility of this in a paper in 1973.</p>

<p>However, Professor Crick and his colleagues concluded that the scientific evidence was 'inadequate at the present time to say anything about the probability'.</p>
