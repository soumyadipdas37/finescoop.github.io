<p>Despite Joe's criminal actions viewers considered him an anti-hero, whilst Carole was branded a villain due to Joe losing his animal park as well as his freedom and the rumours that were given screen time by the filmmakers about the mysterious disappearance of her second husband Don Lewis.</p>

<p>Back in 1997, the 59-year-old Wildlife on Easy Street owner mysteriously disappeared shortly before his second wife Carole took control of his will and reported $5M estate. </p>

<p>Carole hopes she gets a long run on the dancefloor so people can see that she is far from the nasty individual that she has been painted to be.</p>

<p>During an appearance on Good Morning America, she said: 'Tiger King really glamorized animal abusers and villainized me for trying to stop animal abuse, and so I felt really betrayed by that. But what amazed me was how many people believed that false portrayal of me without doing anything to find out who I really am. It's been a nightmare since Tiger King aired.' </p>
