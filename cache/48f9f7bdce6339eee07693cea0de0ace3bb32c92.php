<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>This was the week when TV star Kate Garraway should have been renewing her wedding vows with husband Derek Draper to mark their 15th anniversary.</p>

<p>Instead, the TV presenter faces a 'very strange' day as her husband continues his fight in hospital against coronavirus. </p>

<p>In a moving interview in today's You magazine, Kate, 53, says: 'We hope and believe he will come out of it but we just don't know. </p>

<p>This was the week when TV star Kate Garraway should have been renewing her wedding vows with husband to mark their 15th anniversary</p>

<p>'The heart of the family has been ripped out and we don't know if we will ever get it back.'</p>

<p>The Good Morning Britain star returned to work in July on the advice of doctors who said she needed to re-establish a routine.</p>

<p>She has been strong for their two children, Darcey, 14 – who was planning a 'second wedding' for her parents on Thursday – and Billy, 11, but admits to moments when she's 'consumed with fear'. </p>

<p>She seeks comfort in the sort of light-hearted moments that Derek – a 'massive believer in silliness' – would enjoy, adding: 'It's trenches humour. </p>

<p>'You need it to get through. So with the children I'd try to do things in a different way. </p>

<p>'We'd go and bounce on the trampoline for exercise and they'd laugh at how bad I was.'</p>

<p>Kate Garraway's husband Derek Draper (pictured together) fell ill at the start of lockdown. He is now out of an induced coma but remains in intensive care</p>

<p>Draper, a former political lobbyist turned psychotherapist, fell ill at the start of lockdown and was rushed to hospital on the advice of Good Morning Britain doctor Hilary Jones. </p>

<p>He is now out of an induced coma but remains in intensive care.</p>

<p>Describing how 'everyone has been staggeringly supportive', Kate reveals that she even received a note from Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with Covid in April.</p>

<p>'Boris handwrote me a really lovely note and Carrie [his fiancee] has sent us messages via other people. </p>

<p>'So I have seen a very human side to them. Boris's public face gets a lot of stick but the challenge is that politicians are in the dark like us.'</p>
