<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Formula One legend Michael Schumacher is reportedly spending time at a luxury villa in Majorca his wife bought three years ago from Real Madrid president Florentino Perez.</p>

<p>The seven-time world champion has been moved to the exclusive property on the upmarket estate of Las Brisas near Andratx in the south-west of the island from his Swiss home, Spanish press say.</p>

<p>The mansion where the 51-year-old is battling to get better has been identified as Villa Yasmin, which Corinna Schumacher is said to have purchased in 2017.</p>

<p>Michael (right before his accident) and his wife (left) previously owned a villa on the island and are thought to have holidayed there regularly before his devastating skiing accident in 2013</p>

<p>Spanish press including respected Majorcan daily Diario de Mallorca and Catalan daily La Vanguardia published their reports after ex-Formula 1 team boss and former QPR co-owner Flavio Briatore's ex-wife Elisabetta Gregoraci claimed: 'Michael doesn't speak, he communicates with his eyes.</p>

<p>'Only three people can visit him and I know who they are.'</p>

<p>Speaking on the Italian version of Big Brother the brunette added, in comments echoed by Spanish press: 'They moved to Spain and his wife has set up a hospital in that house.'</p>

<p>German tabloid Bild first linked the F1 legend to Florentino Perez's Majorca mansion in July 2018, saying Corinna had purchased it for Â£27m so she could spend holidays there with her children and friends.</p>

<p>The house was bought by Perez in 2005 but he sold it in 2017 following the death of his wife</p>

<p>The house was bought by building magnate Perez in 2005 but he put it up for sale in 2017 after the death of his wife Mari Angeles Sandoval.</p>

<p>The villa is part of a 15,000 square metre estate which boasts two swimming pools, a helipad, a gym and a huge palm-tree-fringed garden.</p>

<p>Schumacher, the only driver in history to win seven F1 World Championships, was placed in a medically-induced coma after a life-threatening skiing accident in December 2013 in the French Alps.</p>

<p>He was relocated to the family home on the shores of Lake Geneva in September 2014.</p>

<p>Updates on his health have been few and far between.</p>

<p>Renowned neurosurgeon Erich Riederer claimed last week there was little chance Schumacher would ever make a full recovery.</p>

<p>The surgeon, thought to have been giving his opinion as an outsider, said in a documentary on French television station TMC: 'I think he's in a vegetative state, which means he's awake but not responding.</p>

<p>'He is breathing, his heart is beating, he can probably sit up and take baby steps with help, but no more.</p>

<p>'I think that's the maximum for him. Is there any chance of seeing him like he was before his accident? I really don't think so.'</p>

<p>Riederer's interview came shortly after ex-Ferrari boss Jean Todt revealed he had visited Schumacher at his Swiss home and said: 'He is fighting. I hope the world will be able to see him again.</p>

<p>'This is what he and his family are working towards.'</p>

<p>The F1 legend's health has been shrouded in secrecy since his near-fatal brain injury in 2013 after falling and cracking his head while skiing off-piste.</p>

<p>He left Grenoble Hospital in June 2014 after regaining consciousness for further rehabilitation at the University Hospital in Lausanne, Switzerland before leaving to continue his recovery at home.</p>
