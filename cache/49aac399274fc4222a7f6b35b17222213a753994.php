<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The glamorous wife of a heavily-tattooed alleged bikie has admitted to buying a Play Station 4 and shoes with fake cash during a massive $1300 shopping spree.</p>

<p>Kayla Tianne Attie, 23, was out late-night shopping with two of friends in August last year when she used counterfeit cash at both EB Games and Footlocker.</p>

<p>CCTV from inside Westfield Eastgardens, in Sydney's south-east, captured footage of the trio - including Attie who was described as blonde and with lip fillers - carrying a number of bags out of the store about 9.30pm, having shopped for some two hours.</p>

<p>But after the money was found to be counterfeit, NSW Police's anti-bikie Strike Force Raptor knocked on the door of the home Attie shares with her husband and alleged Finks OMCG member Sarmad Mekhail.</p>

<p>The couple held hands inside the Downing Centre Local Court on Monday as Attie's lawyer Michael Moussa entered guilty pleas to one count of dishonestly obtaining property.</p>

<p>Kayla Tianne Attie (pictured with husband Sarmad Mekhail), 23, has admitted to using a bunch of fake cash to buy a Play Station 4 and shoes at Westfield Eastgardens in Sydney's south-east</p>

<p>The wife (pictured) of alleged Finks bikie gang member Mekhail allegedly spent a total $1300 at EB Games and Footlocker during a late-night shopping spree with friends last August</p>

<p>Attie was initially faced with five offences relating to the dodgy shopping spree, but police prosecutors did a plea deal with Mr Moussa to drop four of those charges. </p>

<p>Court documents told how Attie and her two friends walked around the Eastgardens shopping centre with bundles of $100 notes in their pockets like something out of a gangster movie.</p>

<p>First they walked into the EB Games store about 8.40pm and handed over five of the green $100 notes for a Play Station 4.</p>

<p>Next they stepped into a nearby Footlocker shop where CCTV showed Attie pulling a bundle of $100 notes contained with a rubber band from her pocket.</p>

<p>She handed over eight of the notes, received $70 in change and left with her hands full with bags of shoes.</p>

<p>But more than two months later she was awoken at 6.25am to the noise of anti-bikie Strike Force Raptor banging on her door.</p>

<p>The heavily-armed police entered the home and arrested her.</p>

<p>Officers then raided the property where she lived with alleged bikie Mekhail and the couple's young son.</p>

<p>Inside they found a black Play Station 4 matching the one bought months earlier.</p>

<p>The crime is set to come as a shock to Attie's social media followers, where she regularly posts a series of selfies in expensive lingerie (pictured) or of her lavish lifestyle</p>

<p>In June she showed off a Gucci belt and a fancy black dress as she and her husband smiled at their son Elias' christening</p>

<p>Attie's shopping spree at Footlocker and EB Games totalled $1300, but initially it was alleged she had spent more than $2000.</p>

<p>The dropped charges included $247 spent at women's clothing store Supre.</p>

<p>The guilty plea to obtaining property by deception must come as a shock for Attie's social media followers, to who she regularly showed off a lavish lifestyle. </p>

<p>In June she showed off a Gucci belt and a fancy black dress as she and her husband smiled at their son's christening.</p>

<p>The tattooed pair were married in early 2019 after the birth of their son, Elias. </p>

<p>CCTV from inside Westfield Eastgardens captured Attie shopping with two friends, with police describing her as 'blonde' with 'lip fillers'</p>

<p>Attie was initially hit with five charges but will return to the Downing Centre Local Court on October 21 for sentencing on just one count of dishonestly obtain property</p>

<p>'Standing by your side and watching you become the person and daddy you are today has been so special,' she wrote last year.</p>

<p>'I am so so blessed to have you as my partner and can’t wait to be on this crazy ride called life with you. Baby No.2?'</p>

<p>Attie will return to court on October 21 for sentencing. </p>
