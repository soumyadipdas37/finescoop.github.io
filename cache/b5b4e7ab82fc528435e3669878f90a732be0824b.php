<p>Heir to the throne Leonor and younger sister Sofia, both wearing face masks, waved to cameras as they climbed the steps to the school before having their temperature checked by a member of staff. </p>

<p>It comes days after Spain became the first country in Western Europe to register 500,000 coronavirus infections, with a second surge in cases that coincided with schools reopening. </p>

<p>It is believed that Princess Leonor is starting of fourth year of secondary education, while her younger sister Princess Sofia is beginning her second year at the school. </p>

<p>It has been a challenging summer for the Spanish royal family, after runaway former King Juan Carlos caused shockwaves around the country in August by announcing he was leaving his homeland. </p>

<p>Queen Letizia of Spain looked like any other mother as she watched her girls arrive at school</p>

<p>Princess Leonor has now been deemed by some as a saviour of the monarchy, with  The Times writing: 'Attention must turn to the future if the Bourbon monarchy is to survive.</p>

<p>'It is a responsibility that rests of the shoulders of Leonor, and the reigning king, Felipe VI, knows that, as he introduces her to the country while trying to modernise the monarchy.' </p>

<p>The publication went on to say the young princesses are 'the future for a modernised monarchy.'</p>

<p>'Leonor is still very young, but modern, well-educated and a woman — which is important as the feminist movement grows in Spain,' a palace source reportedly said. 'She is a great asset.' </p>

<p>Leonor, left, and Sofia, right, both have trendy keyrings attached to their schoolbags, just like any other pupils</p>

<p>The sisters had their temperature checked on their arrival at school this morning</p>

<p>The sisters waited to have their temperatures checked as part of measures introduced to stop the spread of Covid-19</p>

<p>Leonor made her public-speaking debut at at awards ceremony in Barcelona last November, where she gave comments in Spanish, Catalan, English and Arabic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, she and Sofía read from Don Quixote on World Book Day in April, and addressed the nation in a video amid the coronaviurs pandemic. </p>

<p>Her return to school comes as Spain struggles to control a recent spike in infections amid schools reopening across the country.</p>

<p>Recent infections have been more common among younger people who often develop no symptoms thanks to their stronger immune systems, and the death rate remains far below the March-April peak when daily fatalities routinely exceeded 800.</p>
