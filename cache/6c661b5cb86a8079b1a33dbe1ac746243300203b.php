<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The mother of a 16-year-old schoolgirl who was left fighting for her life after taking ecstasy has shared a picture of her in hospital as a warning to parents of the danger of drugs.</p>

<p>Remy Turner was rushed to hospital after she took MDMA, also known as ecstasy, and suffered a seizure in Guernsey in July.</p>

<p>The teenager was unconscious and was placed in a coma for six days as she battled for her life.   </p>

<p>Her mother, Louise Turner, has shared a picture of Remy in a coma and described it as the most terrifying experience of her life, adding doctors called her a 'miracle' child when she woke up.</p>

<p>She said: 'Seeing your little girl linked up to literally dozens of tubes and machines in ICU with what must have been like 15 doctors and nurses all crowded around her bed is not something you forget.</p>

<p>'I was told three times that Remy wouldn't make it.</p>

<p>Remy Turner, 16, spent six days in a coma after she suffered a seizure when she took party drug MDMA, also known as ecstasy </p>

<p>Louise Turner, pictured with her daughter, said she was told on three occasions that Remy wouldn't survive </p>

<p>'Her dad and step-mum flew over from Jersey, pretty much to say their goodbyes.' </p>

<p>After falling ill on Friday, July 31, Remy was rushed to Princess Elizabeth Hospital on the Channel Island, but showed no sign of recovery for the first three nights.   </p>

<p>Machines were feeding her, breathing for her and, ultimately, keeping her alive. </p>

<p>Ms Turner said: 'We took pictures of her in the ICU, because she was totally unaware of all the fear, all the tears, all the hurt we'd been through wishing, hoping, praying that she would be okay.</p>

<p>'Remy is still trying to understand it all now, but I shared some of the photos on Facebook as well to raise awareness of how serious it can be to take drugs.' </p>

<p>After six days of heavy sedation, she woke up.</p>

<p>Remy, who lives with her family in Guernsey, said: 'When I woke up the doctor asked me what day I thought it was, and I still just thought it was that Friday evening. I didn't know how much time had passed.</p>

<p>'I was so confused, I didn't understand any of it.'</p>

<p>For nights afterwards she could not be left alone as she was having terrible nightmares, hallucinations and had forgotten how to walk.</p>

<p>Remy, from Guernsey, had to rely on machines to breathe for her and feed her as she battled the effects of the drug</p>

<p>Thankfully, the recovery happened much quicker than expected, and Remy is already off her anti-seizure medication. </p>

<p>Her family say she will not be able to enjoy a drink however, as her liver will not be able to cope.  </p>

<p>Remy added: 'I really regret the choice I made, and I wish I never did it. I will never do anything like this again.</p>

<p>'It's difficult to explain how I feel now. The stress and pain I put our friends and family through is something I never want to do again.</p>

<p>'I want to help people now. I'm not going to preach because I don't think people will ever stop taking drugs, but I want to tell my story to show what can happen when you make those choices.'</p>

<p>More than two months after nearly losing her life, Remy (left) has accepted taking the drug was 'stupid,' as Louise (right) launched a fundraising campaign to thank the doctors and nurses who battled to save her daughter</p>

<p>Ms Turner said Remy acknowledged it was a 'stupid' thing to have done, but now the pair want to raise awareness of the risks of taking drugs and use her story to prevent others from making a similar mistake.</p>

<p>Grateful to the staff at the hospital and emergency ambulance service that saved Remy's life, the family has set up a GoFundMe page.</p>

<p>Louise added: 'I want to give something back to everyone who was so incredibly supportive and helpful while Remy was in hospital.</p>

<p>Remy is now off her anti-seizure medication, but is still unable to drink as doctors say she will not be able to cope</p>

<p>'We're asking for donations so that I can put some money on a tab at a restaurant or something and treat everyone there to say thank you.</p>

<p>'The team at the hospital and ICU were incredible. They kept a diary of her time in hospital to show how ill she really was. I don't know how we can ever repay them, but this fundraising project is a start at least.'</p>

<p>The fundraising campaign has already doubled its initial £700 target.</p>
