<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The wife of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has started blocking journalists on social media as the embattled state leader comes increasingly under fire over Melbourne's Stage Four lockdown.</p>

<p>Alex White and Rachel Baxendale - state political reporters for The Herald Sun and The Australian - both discovered Catherine Andrews had blocked them from seeing her profile on Twitter.</p>

<p>The reason for Mrs Andrews blocking the journalists remains unclear but both publications have heavily criticised her husband over the harsh restrictions put in place in Victoria during the state's second COVID-19 wave.</p>

<p>State political reporters for both publications - which have run heavy criticism of the premier's Stage Four restrictions in recent weeks - were blocked from seeing Mrs Andrews' posts (her profile pictured)</p>

<p>Baxendale said she could not remember ever speaking to the premier's wife in person or online, The Australian reported. </p>

<p>Mrs Andrews has also liked dozens of tweets in the past day containing the hashtag '#IStandWithDan'.</p>

<p>A post praising her husband's work ethic meanwhile remains pinned to the top of her profile.</p>

<p>Premier Andrews' team has declined to comment on whether Mrs Andrews had blocked the journalists intentionally.</p>

<p>Pressure on her husband is continuing to grow despite him releasing a road map on Sunday to bring Victoria out of lockdown as coronavirus infections continue to fall.</p>

<p>The strict Stage Four lockdown will continue for another two weeks beyond the originally scheduled September 13 end date, while retail shops will not be able to open in full until October.</p>

<p>Thousands of frustrated Melburnians have vowed this Sunday to leave a pair of boots outside their homes in a mass protest demanding the Victorian premier step down. </p>

<p>The movement, Give Dan The Boot, is set to take place on Sunday with more than 3,000 people already vowing to take part. </p>

<p>The at-home protest is the brainchild of the group Victoria Forward, which is run by 19-year-old Donald Trump supporter and Liberal member Edward Bourke.</p>

<p>Sunday's scheduled demonstration comes after anti-lockdown protests erupted across the country over the weekend, with 17 arrested in Melbourne and 160 fines issued.  </p>

<p>More than 3,000 Melburnians have said they would take part at the at-home protest on Sunday</p>

<p>'It's time to stand up to Daniel Andrews, and now you can do it from home!' the Facebook event reads.</p>

<p>'Please place a pair of boots or shoes at your front gate or around your fence this Sunday, 13th of September and post a photo to this event or use the tag #GiveDanTheBoot. </p>

<p>'GIVE DAN THE BOOT is a silent protest but the image of thousands of boots outside the gates of Victorian households, will decisively convey that the Victorian people have no faith in the premier.'</p>

<p>One Melbourne resident shared a homemade sign she had made with the words #GiveDanTheBoot painted across a piece of cardboard</p>

<p>The group also said that due to the protest being carried out at home, no COVID-19 restrictions would be breached.</p>

<p>The page has been flooded with members criticising the premier's strict lockdown, which has been extended by another two weeks. </p>

<p>A grieving family have also used a death notice to slam Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews' as a 'dictator' over his controversial Stage Four lockdown. </p>

<p>Peter Mitchell's family took aim at Daniel Andrews and plan to hold a memorial service for Mr Mitchell 'when the dictator is overthrown'</p>

<p>The notice for husband, father and grandfather Peter Mitchell, published in  Wednesday's The Age, said they would only hold a memorial service for their dad when the extreme lockdown ends.   </p>

<p>'Memorial Service to be held when the dictator is overthrown,' Mr Mitchell's family wrote in The Age. </p>

<p>He died on Monday and was described as 'an exceptional man with an exceptional mind, wit and heart'.  </p>
