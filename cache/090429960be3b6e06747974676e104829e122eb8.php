<p>Yesterday Apple rose just under 4 per cent after a report that the company had asked suppliers to make at least 75million 5G iPhones for later this year.</p>

<p>It was also boosted by a four-for-one stock split that made its shares more affordable to more investors, which was first announced five weeks ago.</p>

<p>The company cut each $500 (£375) share into four $125 (£95) shares, saying it did so for a broader base of investors to afford to buy its stock.</p>
