<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Renault will change its name to Alpine from the 2021 Formula One season. </p>

<p>The team will take on the new name and also have a new team colour scheme with the yellow and black being scrapped for a red, white and blue set-up synonymous with the French flag.</p>

<p>'Alpine is a beautiful brand, powerful and vibrant, that brings a smile to the faces of its followers,' new chief executive Luca de Meo said in a statement ahead of the Italian Grand Prix on Sunday. </p>

<p>Renault will change its name to 'Alpine' for the 2021 Formula One season, it has been revealed</p>

<p>'By introducing Alpine, a symbol of French excellence, to the most prestigious of the world's automotive disciplines, we are continuing the adventure of manufacturers in a renewed sport.</p>

<p>'We are bringing a dream brand alongside the biggest names, for spectacular car races made and followed by enthusiasts. </p>

<p>'Alpine will also bring its values to the F1 paddock: elegance, ingenuity, and audacity.' </p>

<p>The team's traditional yellow and black colours will be replaced by red, white and blue colours</p>

<p>Chief executive Luca de Meo confirmed the news ahead of the 2020 Italian Grand Prix </p>

<p>Renault who had made losses under De Meo, had announced a new organisational structure focused on core brands rather than geographical regions, with Renault F1 team principal Cyril Abiteboul overseeing one of the four divisions.</p>

<p>Abiteboul said: 'This change comes at a key moment in the trajectory of the team and the sport. Alpine brings a new meaning, new values and colours to the paddock with the spirit of competition from other worlds and French creative agility. </p>

<p>'These will be assets in the preparation of 2022 deadlines. The new regulatory and financial framework will establish the conditions for a fairer motor sport in its redistribution of revenues; simpler and progressive in its governance. </p>

<p>'The implementation of the "budget cap" will put an end to the expense race and will allow the signatory teams to be measured for their sporting value. Alpine has its place in Formula 1 and can challenge for victory.'</p>
