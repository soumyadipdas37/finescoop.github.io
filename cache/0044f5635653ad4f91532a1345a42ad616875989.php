<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Disgraced former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke was pictured arriving at court alone today ahead of his sentencing for three sexual assaults on two younger women. </p>

<p>The 49-year-old is facing a jail sentence at Southwark Crown Court this morning after being found guilty of the attacks earlier this year. </p>

<p>Elphicke declared himself a 'naughty Tory' as he chased his first victim around his central London family home in summer 2007, moments after groping her while they shared a bottle of wine.</p>

<p>He also groped a second woman, a parliamentary worker in her early 20s with whom he was 'besotted', twice in a month while Dover MP in 2016.</p>

<p>The court heard Elphicke, a father of two and qualified lawyer, lied to police, senior colleagues and his own wife about what happened.</p>

<p>Wife Natalie Elphicke - his successor as Dover MP last year - only learned of his emotional attachment to the parliamentary worker when she looked over case files during lockdown.</p>

<p>Mrs Elphicke announced the end of her 25-year marriage on Twitter as she sat in a taxi leaving court less than an hour after the verdicts were returned.</p>

<p>She had previously stood by her husband's side during his trial.  </p>

<p>Former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke arriving at Southwark Crown Court in London to be sentenced for three counts of sexual assault</p>

<p>She broke the news to Elphicke and their young son earlier, and later said she found the court ordeal 'horrible, humiliating'.</p>

<p>Elphicke also kept an affair with a third woman between 2015 and 2017 secret from his wife until his arrest in 2018.</p>

<p>Neither the victims, or the third woman, can be identified for legal reasons.</p>

<p>Elphicke, whose official Twitter account and website disappeared following his conviction, was told by judge Mrs Justice Whipple there was 'a very real possibility' he will be jailed.</p>

<p>The court heard how the first offence took place when Elphicke invited a woman in her early 30s to share a drink with him while his children were asleep and his wife was up country with work - the first time she had been away since the birth of their son.</p>

<p>The woman said Elphicke asked her about bondage and sex, then kissed her and groped her breast before chasing her around his home.</p>

<p>Breaking down in court, she told jurors: 'I was just shocked - really, really shocked.</p>

<p>'He was saying really bizarre things that are embarrassing, like 'I'm a naughty Tory'.</p>

<p>'He was trying to grope me and trying to grab my bum.'</p>

<p>Mrs Elphicke announced the end of her 25-year marriage on Twitter as she sat in a taxi leaving court less than an hour after the verdicts were returned in July</p>

<p>The second complainant said Elphicke also tried to kiss her and then groped her when they met for a drink in Westminster in April 2016.</p>

<p>He then told her: 'I'm so naughty sometimes.'</p>

<p>The victim said: 'He had his mouth open, continually trying to kiss me.</p>

<p>'It was like a disgusting, slobbery mess.'</p>

<p>She said she spurned Elphicke's sexual advances, telling jurors she was physically repulsed by him, and that Elphicke told her he had 'not been happy for years' in his marriage.</p>

<p>She said he assaulted her again the following month when he ran his hand up her thigh towards her groin.</p>

<p>Elphicke said he kissed the first victim because he initially felt it was something they both wanted.</p>

<p>He told jurors he was 'besotted' with the second complainant, but denied assaulting either of them.</p>

<p>The court heard Elphicke initially denied any knowledge of the allegations against the parliamentary worker when he was summoned before Tory party whips in January 2017.</p>

<p>He later called on his 'friend', the former attorney general Dominic Grieve, to accompany him to a second meeting, although he failed to mention to Mr Grieve that he had strong feelings for the woman.</p>

<p>Elphicke also admitted lying to police about the same issue, banking on him not being prosecuted and therefore being able to keep it from his wife.</p>

<p>He became a government whip under David Cameron's premiership in 2015, but returned to the back benches when Theresa May came to power the following year.</p>

<p>Elphicke had the party whip suspended in 2017 when allegations of sexual assault first emerged, but it was controversially reinstated a year later for a crucial confidence vote in then-prime minister Mrs May.</p>

<p>The whip was withdrawn again the following summer when the Crown Prosecution Service announced its decision to charge Elphicke.</p>

<p>Last month, police arrested an unnamed Conservative former minister on suspicion of rape. He was released on bail until November.</p>
