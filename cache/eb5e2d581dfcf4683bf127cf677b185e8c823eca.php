<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Thiago Alcantara has been given additional time off by Bayern Munich and the next few days will be crucial in deciding his future. </p>

<p>The midfielder could yet move to Liverpool if Georginio Wijnaldum leaves the club for Barcelona, where Ronald Koeman is keen to bring him in. </p>

<p>Alcantara recently insisted that he had never publicly declared his desire to leave Bayern but his house is up for sale and he has said goodbyes to team-mates. </p>

<p>Thiago Alcantara has been in action for Spain in the Nations League in the last week </p>

<p>The German champions have 'afforded the Spaniard the next few days off' to rest and get his affairs in order following the Nations League games, according to Bild. </p>

<p>And according to Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano, the next few days are key, with Bayern still holding out for £27million.  </p>

<p>Alcantara played all 90 minutes in the 1-1 draw with Germany and then the 4-0 victory over Ukraine on Monday evening. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old has been of long term interest for Jurgen Klopp but Liverpool must sell to buy and much will depend on whether a Barcelona deal with Wijnaldum can be agreed. </p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp could move for the midfielder if Georginio Wijnaldum joins Barcelona</p>

<p>Alcantara starred in the 4-0 win over Ukraine on Monday night and is set for a few days off</p>

<p>Bayern Munich boss Hansi Flick has given Alcantara time off with the transfer saga ongoing</p>

<p>The Dutchman is a favourite of Koeman's having worked together with the national side and he has just one year left of his contract at Anfield.  </p>

<p>Another factor under consideration is Barcelona's interest in Thiago themselves. </p>

<p>A return for their former player is not out of the question, with a number of the board more keen to see him back at the Nou Camp ahead of Wijnaldum. </p>

<p>There are some board members understanding of Koeman's desire to get in the player he knows well and the next week is likely to prove decisive in the transfer plans of both clubs.  </p>

<p>Wijnaldum is of interest to Ronald Koeman at the Nou Camp and his future is undecided</p>
