<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother has given her dining room chairs a clever upgrade with stylish grey fabric covers for $196 - a fraction of the price she would have paid for a new set.</p>

<p>Karly Meljak had grown tired of the black leather seats in the kitchen of her Port Macquarie home, but 'didn't want to spend a fortune' on new furniture in case her three-year-old daughter ruined them.</p>

<p>Instead, the budget savvy mum-of-one from New South Wales gave them a new lease of life with fabric covers from Spotlight, Australia's leading supplier of arts, crafts and home interiors.</p>

<p>Ms Meljak shared her idea in a Facebook cleaning group, revealing she had bought eight Ardor Surefit Urban Dining Covers in an online sale which saw them marked down from $35 to $24.50.</p>

<p>Tired of the black leather dining chairs (left) in the kitchen of her Port Macquarie home, mother-of-one Karly Meljak gave them a new lease of life with covers from Spotlight (right)</p>

<p>'Spaghetti nights - no problems, just remove darling daughters cover during dinner,' she wrote in the caption.</p>

<p>'However if there is a stain just remove, treat and put in washing machine. So in love with my new chairs.'</p>

<p>Available in 'Grey Marle' and 'Seafoam', a shade of eggshell blue, the covers are stitched from elasticated polyester that's 'easy to work with' and 'instantly gives your room a fresh new look'.</p>

<p>And in good news for those who want to follow Ms Meljak's lead, they are still reduced to $24.50, while stocks last.</p>

<p>Covering eight chairs like she did would cost just $196, a reasonable price for stylish new upholstery. </p>

<p>Hundreds of comments under photos of the revamped dining chairs praised the idea, with many saying it's exactly what they need for their own homes.</p>

<p>'Wow I have the same chairs and I'm not a fan anymore either. These could be a good compromise until I replace them!' one mother replied.</p>

<p>'This is what I did when our five-year-old came along. So easy to wash,' said another.</p>

<p>A third added: 'Yassssss (sic)! I have a pretty similar set and have wanted to change the chairs for a long time. Thank you so much for posting this!'</p>

<p>Others said they had bought similar covers on eBay for a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>'It was around $26 for six, I grabbed two sets,' one woman said. </p>
