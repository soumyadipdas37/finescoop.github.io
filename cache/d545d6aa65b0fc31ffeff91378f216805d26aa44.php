<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alesha Dixon has strongly denied a Mis-Teeq royalties dispute with her ex-bandmate.</p>

<p>The Britain's Got Talent judge, 41, was in the group alongside Sabrina Washington and Su-Elise Nash until they split in 2005.</p>

<p>It comes amid claims that the star was being sued by Sabrina, 41, over royalties for singles Why and All I Want, reports The Sun.  </p>

<p>So so so Scandalous! Alesha Dixon has denied being in a Mis-Teeq royalties dispute with her former bandmate (pictured on Britain's Got Talent)</p>

<p>Royalties for each song written and performed by Mis-Teeq, of which Sabrina was the lead vocalist, were decided when the records were penned back in the 00s. </p>

<p>A spokesman for Alesha told MailOnline: 'Alesha wrote the raps on both Why and All I Want and that is why she gets a split, the rest of the song was written by a production team...Sabrina has no reason to sue Alesha.'</p>

<p>They added: 'Sabrina was the lead vocalist, but certainly not the main writer. In terms of the entire Mis-Teeq catalogue, Alesha does receive a larger share as she contributed more the the songs, including writing all the raps.' </p>

<p>They also claimed that all of the Mis-Teeq girls have been receiving their publishing royalties through Universal Music publishing since 2000.</p>

<p>Girl group: Mis-Teeq had seven consecutive top-ten singles including Scandalous and All I Want (pictured Alesha Dixon, Sabrina Washington and Su-Elise Nash circa 2000)</p>

<p>However Mis-Teeq are believed to have been in dispute with Universal - who own the master recordings of their music- in the past.</p>

<p>MailOnline understands that the trio spoke with the recording company three years ago about the rights to their recordings and alleged unpaid royalties, however no deal was made and the dispute is ongoing.</p>

<p>It comes after a source told The Sun that Sabrina was suing Alesha for royalties.</p>

<p>They said: 'It is war. Sabrina had to play second fiddle for years and Alesha received five per cent royalties for the girls' first two songs whereas Sabrina received nothing - they both should have got 2.5 per cent.</p>

<p>'Sabrina wasn't listed as a writer for the tracks but it was written in her contract that she would get pay parity. She feels she is owed thousands.'</p>

<p>They added that seeing Alesha shine on Britain's Got Talent was a 'kick in the teeth' especially after Sabrina was not able to do Strictly, but her former bandmate did get to compete on the dancing show just one year later.</p>

<p>In talks: It comes after claims that Sabrina was planning to 'come out of the shadows of Mis-Teeq' and was looking at radio presenting possibilities (pictured in 2019)</p>

<p>MailOnline has contacted Universal for a comment. Sabrina's representative said: 'We can’t comment.'</p>

<p>During their time dominating the charts Mis-Teeq had two top-ten albums and seven consecutive top-ten singles - including Scandalous and All I Want.</p>

<p>The girl group, which also included Su-Elise Nash, also sold more than 12 million records around the world before splitting in 2005. </p>

<p>It comes after claims Sabrina, who appeared on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2009, was reportedly being eyed up to present a radio show.</p>

<p>The singer was spotted leaving Global Radio Studios in Leicester Square earlier this year where, according to sources, she was discussing potential presenting opportunities on the airwaves. </p>

<p>Insiders told MailOnline at the time: 'This year will really see Sabrina coming into her own and out of the shadows of Mis-Teeq. </p>

<p>'She's had meetings with Global’s top brass and they see so much potential in her.</p>

<p>'She not only has an incredible background in the industry as the lead singer and songwriter of one of the biggest girl groups of the 00s, but she’s got a wealth of music knowledge which bosses think the audience would lap up. </p>

<p>'She has done occasional presenting jobs on TV in the past, but now she’s eyeing up a more permanent spot.'</p>

<p>The source added: 'It’s early stages but Sabrina is open to offers and would love to see if she could get on board.' </p>

<p>Career: Since her Mis-Teeq days, Alesha has gone on to be a judge on Britain's Got Talent </p>
