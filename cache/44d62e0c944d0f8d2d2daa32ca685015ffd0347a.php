<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The iconic Big Prawn will undergo more costly maintenance after a $400,000 upgrade to get a tail. </p>

<p>Rust and cracks have begun to appear on the West Ballina landmark, which is made of a reinforced steel frame covered with sprayed concrete. </p>

<p>The Big Prawn stands outside of Bunnings Ballina, which owns the site and will foot the bill for further maintenance.  </p>

<p>Speaking to The Northern Star, Bunnings Ballina manager Daune Hoare said he is 'currently engaging a tradesperson to treat this'. </p>

<p>'During a recent routine inspection, we spotted some minor rust and a few minor cracks on the outside,' Mr Hoare said. </p>

<p>'We're proud to have the iconic Ballina landmark out the front of our store and we are careful to make sure it's looked after.'  </p>

<p>The cracks and rust are minor so they do not impact the integrity of the structure, according to Bunnings.   </p>

<p>The Big Prawn was originally built in 1989 and is six metres wide and nine metres tall. </p>

<p>The Ballina Shire Council voted to allow the demolition of the Big Prawn in September 2009, but it was never acted upon. </p>

<p>Bunnings purchased the site in 2011 and refurbished the Prawn as part of a $400,000 redevelopment, adding a tail to the concrete crustacean.      </p>

<p>The prawn now sits on a stand next to the entrance of the Bunnings Warehouse car park in West Ballina. </p>

<p>It is one of Australia's many famous 'big things', which includes the Big Pineapple in Woombye, Queensland and The Big Banana in Coffs Harbour, NSW. </p>
