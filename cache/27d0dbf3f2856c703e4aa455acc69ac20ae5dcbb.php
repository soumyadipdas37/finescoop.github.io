<p>Tariq Lamptey has yet to choose his international allegiance between England and Ghana</p>

<p>The 19-year-old wing-back made his first appearance for England's under-21s this month</p>

<p>Lamptey would have to feature in a competitive match for Gareth Southgate's England team to tie down his international allegiance.</p>

<p>Choosing England would see the youngster compete against the likes of Trent Alexander-Arnold, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Reece James on the right side of defence.</p>

<p>Asked if he has decided which country to play for, Lamptey told The Sun: 'No. I'm still young so I'm just looking forward to the next game which is Manchester United and keep playing as well as possible.</p>

<p>'Whatever comes next, we'll see.'</p>

<p>Asked whether the intense competition in his position for England would convince him to play for Ghana, Lamptey replied: 'No.</p>

<p>Lamptey has represented England at four youth age groups but can still play for Ghana</p>

<p>The teenager has enjoyed an excellent start to the season with Brighton, who play Manchester United in their next Premier League match on Saturday</p>

<p>'At the moment I'm just focused on Brighton and playing as many games as possible, keep training as hard as possible, keep playing well and keep a consistent level.</p>

<p>'At the end of the day, the harder I work and the more games I get in are the most important things for my development.</p>

<p>'What happens in the future on the international side, we'll have to wait and see.'</p>

<p>Lamptey, who signed for Brighton from Chelsea in a Â£3million deal back in January, has produced excellent performances against his old club and Newcastle United this season.</p>
