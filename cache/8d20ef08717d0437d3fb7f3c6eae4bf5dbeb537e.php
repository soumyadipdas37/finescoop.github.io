<p>One train passenger has hit out at South Eastern for cancelling trains, as another made claims of overcrowding on a Transport for London bus. </p>

<p>It comes as commuters trickle back to their place of work following the coronavirus lockdown.</p>

<p>One Twitter user, who tweeted a picture of a crowded train carriage today, said: 'You can start by asking South Eastern to service their trains before Monday's rush hour as they keep cancelling trains causing congestion on trains.'  </p>

<p>Another, Dilasha Patel, who tweeted a picture from a London bus, said: 'Maybe ask Sadiq Khan why Transport for London buses are not following maximum capacity.</p>

<p>'For two mornings I've had 20 people on a 14 capacity bus. I'm leaving for work 40 minutes earlier today even though I get there 20 minutes before I start anyway!' </p>

<p>Commuters have slammed transport bosses over cancelled trains and lack of social distancing on London buses as employees head to work in Monday morning's rush hour. Picutred: Commuters arrive at Waterloo Station in London today</p>

<p>According to information on Transport for London's website, double-decker buses can carry up to 30 passengers, while single-deckers, depending on size, can carry either 11 or 14 passengers.</p>

<p>The capacity limits were put on in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. </p>

<p>Today, commuters were seen spilling into London's major train stations, including London Waterloo, as more people begin to return to work in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>The commuters, all wearing face coverings, as required by law, were queuing to get through the ticket gates at the busy railway station - a scene not often witnessed since the country was plunged into lockdown. </p>

<p>Traffic was also busy on the roads this morning, particularly on the M25 around London.</p>

<p>The A40 at Perviale in West London was also seen with queues of traffic on either side of the six lane road. </p>

<p>It comes as train services are ramped up from today to 90 per cent of pre-Covid levels as schools reopen and more workers return to the office.</p>

<p>The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators and Network Rail, said services across Britain will be increased to around 90 per cent of pre-coronavirus pandemic levels from September 7.</p>

<p>Timetables were slashed in March as the virus led to a reduction in available railway workers and demand for travel.</p>

<p>The RDG said new timetables being introduced next month have been devised through communication with schools and other places of education in a bid to run more frequent services or add extra carriages on potentially busy routes.</p>

<p>Schools in England and Wales are reopening in early September.</p>

<p>ScotRail increased services earlier this month ahead of lessons resuming at Scottish schools.</p>
