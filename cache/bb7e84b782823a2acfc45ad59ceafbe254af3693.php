<p>'Well tonight Matthew I'm going to be one of those people!!! But the difference is, I already know I look fabulous in these pics and it’s because I was TWENTY EIGHT years old!!! </p>

<p>'And what's more I STILL HAVE THAT SWIMSUIT!!! It was a two piece by John Galliano and is in my dressing up box. </p>

<p>'The pics were taken on my first trip to St Tropez and Port Grimaud in 1988. B****y hell, thirty two years ago, and when I went there recently I stood on that pier and thought it looked familiar....but it didn't click. </p>

<p>The TV star, 55, posted the 20-year-old snap on Instagram alongside a current one in a two-piece as she embraced her natural body.</p>

<p>She said the photograph, which shows her attempting to cover her body with her hands while on the beach, was sent to her by Carol. </p>

<p>Shy: Carol's post comes days after her Loose Women co-star Nadia Sawalha shared a throwback bikini picture, where she admitted she has spent too long hating her body</p>

<p>The black and white snap shows Nadia standing alongside her friend and co-star Kaye Adams during a beach holiday.</p>

<p>In a lengthy caption, Nadia said: '<?php echo e('@'); ?>the_mcgiff just sent this pic she took twenty years ago to me and <?php echo e('@'); ?>kayeadamsofficial. </p>

<p>'Saying ... Just had to send this to you two because it so perfectly sums up the old Nadia......look at the horror on your face because I was taking a photo of you!!! </p>

<p>'And my god she's right.' </p>

<p>She continued: 'I can actually remember the moment Carol took the photo . I almost wanted to cry because I thought I was so 'hideous ' a word I used all the time to describe myself back then ... look at me trying to cover my body ??</p>

<p>'It leaves me feeling so sad when I look back and think about how much of that holiday I wasted with 'stinking thinking ' feeling 'ugly ' comparing my figure constantly to Kaye Adams and Carol's gorgeous bodies.</p>

<p>'What a b****y waste of time. What a sacrilege.'</p>
