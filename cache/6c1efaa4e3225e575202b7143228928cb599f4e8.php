<p>The 33-year-old entertainment reporter, who rarely speaks about her private life, confirmed she was back on the market during a live segment on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Her last confirmed relationship was with a man who lived in Oxford, England. It's unclear when exactly they broke up.</p>

<p>Watch out, boys! Today host Brooke Boney (pictured) is single again after splitting from her long-term boyfriend. The 33-year-old entertainment reporter, who rarely speaks about her private life, confirmed she was back on the market during a live segment on Wednesday</p>

<p>Brooke was 'stitched up' by her co-hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, who invited her mother, Leonie, on the show to discuss her love life.</p>

<p>Much to Brooke's embarrassment, Leonie openly discussed what sort of man she would like her daughter to date. </p>

<p>She even joked that she was 'pretty set' on having Zac Efron as a son-in-law, but unfortunately he's now seeing Byron Bay local Vanessa Valladares.</p>

<p>'Maybe she should have went on holidays earlier,' Leonie said with a laugh. </p>

<p>Mum's the word! Brooke was 'stitched up' by her co-hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon, who invited her mother, Leonie (right), on the show to discuss her love life</p>

<p>Leonie said she would be happy for her daughter to date any man, 'as long as he's a decent bloke'.</p>

<p>'I even told her to try a tradie,' she added, as the Today panel burst into laughter.</p>

<p>'I did a bit of Googling yesterday and I came up with some options. Trying to look for some single fellas in Australia is crazy.' </p>

<p>Let's talk about love! Leonie said she would love her daughter to 'try a tradie', as the Today panel burst into laughter. Pictured with Today hosts Karl Stefanovic and Allison Langdon</p>

<p>Brooke was visibly mortified and folded her arms at her mother suggested she date an AFL player or a famous actor.</p>

<p>As the co-anchors wrapped up the lighthearted chat, Karl said that he couldn't wait to discuss Brooke's love life with Leonie in more depth.</p>

<p>'No! Stay out of it,' Brooke warned Karl. </p>

<p>Embarrassed: But Brooke, who was left red-faced at her mother's cheeky shortlist of potential suitors, warned Karl to 'stay out of it!'</p>

<p>Brooke has never revealed the identity of her ex-boyfriend, nor has she shared a photo of them together on social media.</p>

<p>In March, she made a passing reference to him during a segment on Today Extra with psychic medium Harry T about relationship superstitions. </p>

<p>Brooke said: 'My boyfriend doesn't walk on the other side of a [traffic] pole. So if there's a pole on the street, he will walk on the same side as me.'</p>

<p>Passing comment: Brooke has never revealed the identity of her English boyfriend or shared a photo of them, and she has rarely discussed him. But back in March, she made a passing reference to her boyfriend during a segment with psychic medium Harry T</p>

<p>She said that her partner's Russian grandmother used to do the same - presumably because she feared walking around the pole would attract negative energy.</p>

<p>Brooke also briefly mentioned her former boyfriend in an interview with Traveller in 2019 when asked where her last overseas trip was. </p>

<p>'Oxford in Britain for a couple of weeks to see my boyfriend,' she said. </p>

<p>Rare mention: Brooke also briefly mentioned him in an interview with Traveller in 2019 when asked where her last overseas trip was. 'Oxford in Britain for a couple of weeks to see my boyfriend,' she said at the time</p>
