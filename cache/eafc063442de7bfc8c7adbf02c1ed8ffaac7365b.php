<p>'Doesn't look like me': Married At First Sight star Lizzie Sobinoff, 29, showed off her very plump pout in a glamorous Instagram selfie. (L) Wednesday (R) on MAFS </p>

<p>Lizzie had her brunette tresses out, while showing off her features. </p>

<p>'Yeah, I don't even think this looks like me,' she captioned the post. </p>

<p>Before adding: 'I was like "okay" the Instagram selfie mode with a swipe across to the 'Paris' filter does wonders.' </p>

<p>Racy: Elizabeth shared raunchy photos of her boyfriend Seb Guilhaus, 32, (R) on Tuesday, including one in a pair of tiny red jocks</p>

<p>Lizzie looked worlds away from her first time on the reality show back in 2019, when she was paired with Sam Ball. </p>

<p>Lizzie is now in a relationship with Seb Guilhaus, with the couple going from strength to strength since getting together. </p>

<p>The former jewellery store manager shared a number of raunchy pictures of the former Adelaide footballer to Instagram on Tuesday.  </p>

<p>Almost nude: In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress</p>

<p>'I know I said I was giving posting a break but let's just give some appreciation for my man Seb Guilhaus,' she wrote.   </p>

<p>In the accompanying image, which was split into four pictures, Seb was seen shirtless at a beach, and posing against a wall in various stages of undress. </p>

<p>In one frame, the tanned Adonis is seen rocking a pair of itty-bitty red jocks, that appeared rolled down, perhaps to avoid tan lines.  </p>

<p>Ringing it in: 'He said to me ''Is it S &amp; L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it,' Lizzie wrote</p>

<p>Lizzy went on to promote the personal trainer's six-week challenge. 'Far out why would you not join his 6 week challenge,' she questioned.</p>

<p>Before adding: 'Get a glimpse of this every morning and night. He's going to kill me for posting this �� #sorrynotsorry.'  </p>

<p>She finished: 'Literally in the other room right next to me and has no idea' </p>

<p>It comes after the couple sparked engagement rumours, after they swapped silver rings at the weekend.</p>

<p>So in love! Elizabeth often shares loved-up selfies with her hunky other half, after meeting him during her second stint on Married At First Sight  </p>

<p>Taking to Instagram, Lizzie shared a sentimental photograph of their new jewellery. </p>

<p>'He said to me ''Is it S &amp; L ?'' I said ''Yeah, baby''... Corny but I love it.'   </p>

<p>Over at Seb's Instagram, he wrote: 'Compromise ... give and take ... melding of two worlds.'</p>

<p>'For relationships to flourish we need to want to really be a part of each others worlds,' he continued. </p>

<p>The rings were just a sweet gesture and not to signify an engagement. </p>

<p>Happy couple: Since meeting on the popular dating show, Seb recently relocated to Sydney where they are now living as a couple</p>
