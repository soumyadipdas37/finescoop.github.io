<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Elon Musk-owned SpaceX has launched the first south bound rocket from Cape Canaveral in Florida for the first time in more than 50 years.</p>

<p>The Falcon 9 rocket was launching an Argentinian SAOCOMB 1B satellite into polar orbit where it will monitor the Earth for signs of impending natural disasters.  </p>

<p>To reach polar orbit the rocket had to do a 'dog leg' manoeuvres to the east to avoid heavily populated areas while it was climbing to higher altitudes. </p>

<p>Usually polar orbit launches liftoff from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California as they can head out to sea and fly up over the Pacific Ocean - but a spate of wildfires near the launch site prompted SpaceX and the US Air Force to look for alternatives.</p>

<p>The last polar orbit launch from Florida was a weather satellite in 1969 - sent up on behalf of the NOAA forerunner the Environmental Science Services Administration.  </p>

<p>A SpaceX Falcon 9 lifts off from Pad 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida on Sunday, August 30, 2020. The rocket is carrying the SAOCOM 1B satellite for Argentina</p>

<p>Second man on the Moon, Buzz Aldrin, praised SpaceX for the launch in his backyard</p>

<p>SpaceX was due to launch two rockets on Sunday - one headed for polar orbit and another carrying Starlink satellites that was called off due to bad weather.   </p>

<p>To reach polar orbit the Falcon 9 headed south after liftoff at 00:18 BST, then it had to skim along the southeastern Florida coast near Miami before flying over Cuba. </p>

<p>By the time the rocket was flying over Cuba it was at a high enough altitude that it didn't pose a danger to people, according to a spokesperson. </p>

<p>The booster from the Falcon 9 launch touched down safely after a pintpoint landing at Cape Canaveral - ready to be used again in a future launch.</p>

<p>This prompted second man on the Moon, Buzz Aldrin to tweet: 'Falcon 9's launch and first stage landing in my backyard. Well done.' </p>

<p>Rockets flying from Florida usually head eastward towards the Equator so they fly primarily over open ocean before reaching orbit.</p>

<p>In 2016 the US Air Force started examining whether there was a way to safely bring polar launches to Florida due to wildfires getting closer to Vandenberg.</p>

<p>So far only SpaceX is able to launch polar orbiting satellites from Florida as it has an automated 'self destruct' system built into the Falcon 9. </p>

<p>This means that if it is over land and there is a problem the rocket can destroy itself before 'crash landing' even if flight control can't get a signal through to the rocket.</p>

<p>It is expected that most future launch vehicles will include these automated safety systems - allowing to to fly into a polar orbit from Florida.</p>

<p>According to the 45th Space Wing nobody in Cuba was at risk from the Falcon 9.</p>

<p>People at Cherie Down Park in Cape Canaveral, Florida watch the booster landing of the SpaceX Falcon 9, Sunday, Aug. 30, 2020</p>

<p>'It will overfly Cuba, but it'll be at an altitude that we're safe, just like when we're going north,' said Brig. Gen. Douglas Schiess, commander of the 45th Space Wing.</p>

<p>As the rocket entered the northern parts of north America - after its southeastern 'kick' it had to overfly some islands - but again it was at a 'safe altitude'. </p>

<p>“I know that we’re meeting all the safety requirements now, and it really comes down to being at the right altitude and speed at that time - to make sure that any debris that were to fall would be small enough, or not even impact any land, which makes this ability to launch that from a safe perspective,' the general said.</p>

<p>The satellite payload being launched by SpaceX will help the Argentine government watch for potential disasters that could disrupt agriculture, mining and fishing. </p>

<p>Jeff Bezos in front of Blue Origin's space capsule</p>

<p>Jeff Bezos' space tourism project with Blue Origin is competing with a similar programme in development by Space X, the rocket firm founded and run by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, and Virgin Galactic, backed by Richard Branson.</p>

<p>Bezos revealed in April 2017 that he finances Blue Origin with around $1 billion (£720 million) of Amazon stock each year.</p>

<p>The system consists of a pressurised crew capsule atop a reusable 'New Shepard' booster rocket.  </p>

<p>Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world and Blue Origin has successfully used a single New Shepard Rocket six times.</p>

<p>At its peak, the capsule reached 65 miles (104 kilometres), just above the official threshold for space and landed vertically seven minutes after liftoff. </p>

<p>Crewed missions for astronauts or tourists have yet to be announced.</p>

<p>SpaceX appears to be leading the way in the billionaire space race with numerous launches carrying NASA equipment to the ISS and partnerships to send tourists to space by 2021.  </p>

<p>On February 6 2018, SpaceX sent rocket towards the orbit of Mars, 140 million miles away, with Musk's own red Tesla roadster attached. </p>

<p>NASA has already selected two astronauts who will be on-board the first manned Dragon mission. </p>

<p>SpaceX has also started sending batches of 60 satellites into space to help form its Starlink network. </p>

<p>Musk hopes this will provide an interconnected web of satellites around Earth which will beam down free internet to people all around the world. </p>

<p>Richard Branson and Virgin Galactic are taking a different approach to conquering space. </p>

<p>It has repeatedly, and successfully, conducted test flights of the Virgin Galactic’s Unity spaceplane. </p>

<p>The first took place in December 2018 and the latest took place on February 22nd.</p>

<p>The flight accelerated to over 2,000 miles per hour (Mach 2.7). </p>

<p>More than 600 affluent customers to date, including celebrities Brad Pitt and Katy Perry, have reserved a $250,000 (£200,000) seat on one of Virgin's space trips, </p>

<p>The billionaire mogul has previously said he expects Elon Musk to win the race to Mars with his private rocket firm SpaceX. </p>

<p>Richard Branson with the Virgin Galactic craft</p>

<p>SpaceShipTwo can carry six passengers and two pilots. Each passenger gets the same seating position with two large windows - one to the side and one overhead.</p>

<p>The space ship is 60ft long with a 90inch diameter cabin allowing maximum room for the astronauts to float in zero gravity.</p>

<p>It climbs to 50,000ft before the rocket engine ignites. SpaceShipTwo separates from its carrier craft, White Knight II, once it's passed the 50-mile mark.</p>

<p>Passengers become 'astronauts' when they reach the Karman line, the boundary of Earth's atmosphere.</p>

<p>The spaceship will then make a sub-orbital journey with approximately six minutes of weightlessness, with the entire flight lasting approximately 1.5 hours.  </p>
