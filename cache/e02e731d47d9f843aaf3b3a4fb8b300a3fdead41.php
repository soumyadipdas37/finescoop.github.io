<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The final 40 Britain's Got Talent acts have been unveiled, after viewers were forced to wait an unusually lengthy four months to find out who was through to the 2020 semi-finals.</p>

<p>Acts through to the final 40 include an American unicyclist, a frightening dance troupe called The Coven, a trio of hunky string musicians, a 'sexy Doctor Who' magic act and a keyboard-playing Tyrannosaurus Rex.</p>

<p>The series was ground to a halt this year thanks to the COVID-19 outbreak, which put a stop to TV and film production across the UK - and the rest of the world. </p>

<p>This meant the BGT auditions were filmed, but the series had to stop there, back in the spring. </p>

<p>The auditions were aired from April-May, having been shot in the earlier months of 2020, but production was shut down as the UK went into lockdown in March.</p>

<p>This meant crowds could not gather for the live shows, the judges and hosts - Simon Cowell, Alesha Dixon, Amanda Holden, David Walliams, and Ant &amp; Dec - were sent into lockdown, the crew packed up, and the contestants were sent home.</p>

<p>While normally the show airs its live finals and has crowned a winner by the start of the summer, 2020's series of BGT has been on ice for months.</p>
