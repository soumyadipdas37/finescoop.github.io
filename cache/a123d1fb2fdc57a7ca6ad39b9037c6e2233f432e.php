<p>Jordan, 27, said that despite at first thinking lots of the feedback was negative, he's also seen 'so much positivity'.</p>

<p>'All you can really do is go on and speak your own truth. It was a dance piece. No one went on television to be antagonistic or spark a media frenzy. There were no politics,' he added. </p>

<p>The dancer added that he's been receiving encouraging words from the public, with one person even saying they loved the dance when he popped into a petrol station. </p>

<p>Dancing sensation Perri, 24, agreed, adding: 'It wasn't as if we were doing something wrong. We just wanted to get people talking about it.'</p>

<p>'No one should be made to have to scream and shout out or anything – you agree or you don't and you know that it is what it is. No one should be made to feel guilty for saying something or not saying something.' </p>

<p>The choreographer also shed light on the public's overwhelmingly 'positive' response to their powerful set as he told Metro: 'There has genuinely been so much positivity face-to-face, so much positivity online and it just shocks me when I see that many complaints – and then I go 'hang on' that's relatively such a small amount.'</p>

<p>Show judge Alesha, 41, donned the statement jewellery, one week after Diversity's set was also subject to an avalanche of complaints.</p>

<p>However, while her choice of jewellery left some viewers disgruntled, the number of complaints pales in comparison to the 24,500 filed following Diversity's performance the week before.</p>

<p>An Ofcom spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We are assessing these complaints against our broadcasting rules, but are yet to decide whether or not to investigate.' </p>

<p>Grateful: The singer took to Instagram to share a snap of the advert, and wrote: 'Well done <?php echo e('@'); ?>ITV for standing with Diversity'</p>

<p>ITV has 'stood with Diversity' as they featured adverts in national newspapers in support of the controversial dance. </p>

<p>ITV are believed to have spent around £260,000 on the newspaper ads with full-page monochrome pieces in The Metro costing £36,461 and £27,700 in The Mirror. </p>

<p>Alesha was one of many who praised ITV for standing by the dance troupe. The singer took to Instagram to share a snap of the advert and gushed over how 'proud' she was with them. </p>

<p>In her caption, she wrote: 'Well done <?php echo e('@'); ?>ITV for standing with Diversity! Proud of you! This image is in all of the national newspapers today.'</p>

<p>Decision: A spokesperson for government-approved regulatory body Ofcom confirmed to MailOnline no action will be taken for Diversity's BLM-inspired routine </p>

<p>Ashley also shared his gratitude with ITV for standing by Diversity over their Black Lives Matter-inspired performance. </p>

<p>The poster showed a poignant black and white image of Ashley taking the knee alongside the words: 'We are changed by what we see. Just as we are changed when we are seen. ITV stand with Diversity.'</p>

<p>Sharing a snap of the same advert, which shows him kneeling in black-and-white, he wrote: 'This is what change looks like.</p>

<p>'<?php echo e('@'); ?>ITV stand with <?php echo e('@'); ?>Diversity and we've never been prouder. This is in all the national papers today. Thank you again to everyone that has supported us.' </p>
