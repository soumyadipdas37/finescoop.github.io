<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A fundraiser launched for the two LA deputies shot during an ambush over the weekend has amassed more than $315,000 in donations in just over 24 hours – as the reward for helping to locate the gunman responsible rises to $200,000.</p>

<p>The two officers - one, a 31-year-old woman, the other a 24-year-old man – were shot multiple times as they sat inside their patrol car outside the Metro Blue Line station at Willowbrook Avenue and Oak Street on Saturday night by a black male suspect who then fled the scene.</p>

<p>Both are now in a stable condition in hospital, and a massive manhunt is now underway for the hooded gunman, who’s said to be between the ages of 28 and 30.</p>

<p>A GoFundMe page, set up by Keegan McInnis Monday to help cover the costs off the officers’ medical bills, has already reached a staggering $318,850 as of late Tuesday morning.</p>

<p>‘We are asking for our brothers and sisters in our communities as well as our brothers and sisters in law enforcement to come together and help us raise money to ensure their needs and the needs of their families are taken care of,’ the appeal urges. </p>

<p>A GoFundMe page , set up by Keegan McInnis Monday to help cover the costs off the officers’ medical bills, has already reached a staggering $318,850 as of late Tuesday morning</p>

<p>Video released by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department shows the moment the male suspect opened fire on two deputies at a Compton bus station before fleeing on foot</p>

<p>Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva confirmed in an interview with KABC 790 Monday that two donors stepped forward with $25,000 and $50,000 to increase the department’s $100,000 reward for information that leads to the gunman's arrest.</p>

<p>Phillip A. Washington, the CEO of the Los Angeles Metropolitan Authority, later announced his agency would be contributing another $25,000 to the reward, bringing the total up to $200k.</p>

<p>'We hope this small contribution will help to bring the perpetrator to justice,' Washington said in a statement. </p>

<p>The reward amount is expected to continue increasingly significantly in the coming days. </p>

<p>Sheriff Villanueva has also challenged LeBron James, an outspoken activist and Black Lives Matter supporter, to match the current sum.</p>

<p>'This challenge is to Lebron James. I want you to match that and double that reward,' Villanueva said, speaking on KABC Radio, on the John Phillips Show.</p>

<p>'I know you care about law enforcement. You expressed a very interesting statement about your perspective on race relations and on officer-involved shootings and the impact that it has on the African-American community.</p>

<p>'And I appreciated that. But likewise, we need to appreciate that respect for life goes across all professions.'</p>

<p>Villanueva says his department needs all the help it can get to bring the currently unidentified gunman to justice.</p>

<p>Earlier video released by cops showed the suspect approaching an LACSD vehicle parked outside the Metro Blue Line station and opening fire before he fled on foot. </p>

<p>Alex Villanueva, sheriff of LA County, on Monday challenged LeBron James to match the funds</p>

<p>The 31-year-old mother of a six-year-old is seen applying a tourniquet to her partner's arm. She then supported him until ambulances arrived to rescue them on Saturday. Both are now in a stable condition</p>

<p>Claudia Apolinar was identified as the female deputy involved, by DailyMail.com</p>

<p>Moments after the gunman runs away, the passenger door of the patrol car opens and a deputy stumbles out, pressing a hand to their head.</p>

<p>The driver's-side door opens soon after.</p>

<p>Authorities said that the deputies, who both graduated from the police academy 14 months ago, each sustained multiple gunshot wounds.</p>

<p>'That was a cowardly act,' Sheriff Villanueva said at a press conference. 'The two deputies were doing their job, minding their own business, watching out for the safety of the people on the train.</p>

<p>'Seeing somebody just walk up and start shooting on them. It p***es me off. It dismays me at the same time. There's no pretty way to say it.'</p>

<p>In a photo obtained by FOX11 the female deputy, identified by DailyMail.com as Claudia Apolinar, is seen calling for her help as she tended to her partner, a 24-year-old male, who was kneeling behind a pillar after he was also struck in the head.</p>

<p>Harrowing dispatch call reveals a shaky voice called in the shooting, muttering: '998 Compton Pax.' Recognizing the code for a deputy-involved shooting, a dispatcher asks: 'Just happened?' The voice replies, almost unintelligibly, 'Compton Pax, deputies down. Compton Pax 998.'</p>

<p>The suspect, meanwhile, is described as a black male between 28 and 30 years old. He was wearing dark clothing at the time of the shooting and was last seen in a black four-door sedan.</p>

<p>Fox News reporter William la Jeunesse said Monday: 'Los Angeles police will not say this publicly - but some believe this ambush was retaliation for some recent police shootings of black suspects in LA.'</p>

<p>On August 31 black man Dijon Kizzee was shot and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies after he was stopped for a traffic violation while riding a bike. </p>

<p>At the beginning of this month the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors also voted to ask the coroner to conduct an inquest into the fatal deputy shooting of 18-year-old Andres Guardado on June 18. </p>

<p>The gunman, said to be between 28-30, is pictured running from the scene on foot</p>

<p>Protesters blocked the entrance to the hospital where the two Los Angeles sheriff's deputies ambushed in a shooting Saturday are fighting for their lives, chanting: 'We hope they f***ing die'</p>

<p>On Sunday evening a video emerged showing a bystander mocking the attack on the officers as a large convoy of patrol cars raced to the scene.</p>

<p>'Compton. N***** just aired the police out,' the unidentified narrator says with a smile. 'That's crazy. Damn. It goes down in Compton.'</p>

<p>'It's going up. Somebody bust on their a**. Somebody bust on the police. Two sheriffs shot in the face. Two sheriffs shot in the face - they tripping.</p>

<p>'Somebody just ran up on the corner and bust on their a**, right through the window'. He then concludes, grinning: 'It's a wrap.'</p>

<p>And footage said to have been taken outside St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood on Saturday night shows as one protester yells: 'I want to deliver a message to the family of the pigs, I hope they f***ing die.' The protesters had been connected to the Black Lives Matter movement on Twitter but that has not been officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Another demonstrator tells police: 'Y'all gonna die one by one. This ain't gonna stop.'</p>

<p>Donald Trump on Sunday said the man who opened fire should face a 'fast trial death penalty' if the deputies die.</p>

<p>Speaking at a rally in Nevada on Sunday night, he said: 'If you murder a police officer, you should receive the death penalty.'</p>

<p>Joe Biden said: 'This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice. Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished. Jill and I are keeping the deputies and their loved ones in our hearts and praying for a full recovery.'</p>
