<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Dominic Raab has reaffirmed the Government's commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid after speculation a Whitehall shake-up could see the budget slashed. </p>

<p>The Department for International Development today merged with the Foreign Office and there had been suggestions that the aid budget could be reduced as a result.  </p>

<p>The damage done to the UK economy by the ongoing coronavirus crisis had also prompted calls for overseas spending to be cut.  </p>

<p>But Mr Raab said the spending commitment will 'absolutely' survive the merger in a move which will be welcomed by charities but will cause outcry among some Tory MPs. </p>

<p>Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, today reaffirmed the Government's commitment to spending 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid as the Foreign Office merged with the Department for International Development</p>

<p>The merged departments will now be known as the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) with Mr Raab in charge. </p>

<p>International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan has now left the Cabinet and will return to the Tory backbenches. </p>

<p>The merger provoked widespread criticism, including from charities and three former prime ministers, that it would harm the world's poorest people.</p>

<p>Some MPs had suggested the aid budget should be cut to help the UK balance the books in the wake of the current pandemic. </p>

<p>But asked if the 0.7 per cent target would survive the merger, Mr Raab told reporters in London: 'Oh, absolutely.'</p>

<p>Mr Raab was also asked about a report in The Times that Chancellor Rishi Sunak is seeking to divert billions of pounds from foreign aid to pay for upgrades to the UK's intelligence and defence capabilities,. </p>

<p>The Foreign Secretary replied: 'Well, there is loads of tittle tattle, rather colourful, in the media and I am not going to prejudice the comprehensive spending review.'</p>

<p>Earlier, Mr Raab said in a statement that the UK would use diplomacy and the aid budget to alleviate the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and climate change.</p>

<p>He said: 'Global Britain, as a force for good in the world, is leading by example and bringing the international community together to tackle these deadly threats, because it's the right thing to do and it protects British interests.</p>

<p>'We can only tackle these global challenges by combining our diplomatic strength with our world-leading aid expertise.'</p>

<p>He pledged that a £119 million package, to come from the existing aid budget, would help alleviate extreme hunger for over six million people in Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Central African Republic, the Sahel, South Sudan and Sudan.</p>

<p>Although the foreign aid budget is not popular with some Tory MPs, others on the Government benches had reacted angrily to suggestions that ministers could axe the 0.7 per cent commitment. </p>

<p>The merger of the Foreign Office with the Department for International Development was opposed by Tony Blair who said he was 'utterly dismayed' by the move</p>

<p>Former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell said: 'With the ink hardly dry on our manifesto, I don't think the House of Commons would easily agree to balance the books on the backs of the poorest women and children in the world.'</p>

<p>Tory chairman of the Commons defence committee Tobias Ellwood said a cut would be 'shortsighted in failing to appreciate how well-targeted aid can strengthen relationships and open up new markets - thus helping the Treasury'.  </p>

<p>Conservative former prime minister David Cameron previously warned the department merger was a 'mistake' and that it would result in the UK commanding 'less respect' on the global stage.</p>

<p>Tony Blair, the Labour former prime minister whose administration created the international development department in 1997, said he was 'utterly dismayed' by Boris Johnson's decision.</p>
