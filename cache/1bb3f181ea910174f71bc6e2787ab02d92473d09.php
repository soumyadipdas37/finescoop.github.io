<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will miss Monday's visit of Arsenal as he has not fully recovered from the knock which forced him off at half-time of Sunday's win at Chelsea.</p>

<p>The absence of the England midfielder increases the chance of a first start for new signing Thiago Alcantara, who was Henderson's replacement at Stamford Bridge.</p>

<p>'We will see. We have a few days to train, some players have to recover from last night (the 7-2 Carabao Cup win over Lincoln), but he is in contention,' said manager Jurgen Klopp.</p>

<p>Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson will miss Monday's visit of Arsenal after not recovering</p>

<p>Jurgen Klopp confirmed Henderson is not back in training after his injury against Chelsea</p>

<p>Klopp also received some good news with Joe Gomez set to return to training to give him the option of restoring his first-choice centre-back partnership, having been forced to play midfielder Fabinho there last weekend.</p>

<p>'Joe should be back today in training. Billy the Kid (17-year-old centre-back Billy Koumetio) is back in training. Joel (Matip) is not. Hendo is not yet, this game is for sure too early.' </p>

<p>New arrival Thiago impressed after he replaced Henderson at Stamford Bridge, and Jurgen Klopp hinted that he could make his first start for the Reds.</p>

<p>'We will see. We have a few days to train, some boys have to recover so we will see how we set up. </p>

<p>'I have an idea but we time until Monday. He (Thiago) is in contention for sure. Let's see.' </p>

<p>New arrival Thiago impressed after he replaced Henderson and could make his first club start</p>

<p>Both Liverpool and Arsenal have taken six points from their opening two Premier League matches. Klopp had some kind words about his opposing manager on Monday night, Mikel Arteta, as he hailed him as 'exceptional'.</p>

<p>'I am not sure I should compare, but Arteta has showed in a short period he seems to be an exceptional football manager,' the Liverpool boss said in his pre-match press conference.</p>

<p>'The team he sets up now, the structure is exceptional. You can see the balance between defence and attack. Good organisation but freedom for players, uses them in right place. </p>

<p>'He's done a pretty impressive job. He has changed the whole mood in the club, I don't think a lot of people thought he would have won anything but he did that with the FA Cup. </p>

<p>'And now the English super cup, that's pretty impressive. They will be a tough opponent.'</p>

<p>Klopp hailed Arteta an 'exceptional manager' for turning around Arsenal's fortunes last season</p>
