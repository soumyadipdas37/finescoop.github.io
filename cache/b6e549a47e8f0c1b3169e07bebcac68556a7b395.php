<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Israel Adesanya's rise from obscurity to one of the baddest men on the planet happened seemingly overnight - but his rapid ascent belies the arduous journey.</p>

<p>On Sunday, at UFC 253, the Ultimate Fighting Championship's world middleweight champion will face his toughest test yet as he squares off with Paulo Costa.   </p>

<p>Both men hold undefeated records and the bout has already been hyped as 'the fight of the year' and yet despite the immense pressure, Adesanya remains calm and laser focused. </p>

<p>'I'm just gunna keep doing me - as I always have,' the 31-year-old Nigerian-born Kiwi explains to Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>This simple ethos has been a guiding principle throughout his short yet immensely successful MMA career. </p>

<p>An unwavering self-belief that developed from an early age, when his family travelled from Nigeria to the backblocks of Rotorua looking for a new and better life. </p>

<p>Adesanya's new beginning got off to a rocky start, marred by frequent clashes with bullies – and racists – on the streets and in the playgrounds of rural New Zealand.</p>

<p>The trick Adesanya learned was to talk to himself – to 'build myself up,' he says – with moments of self-reflection and positive reinforcement that slowly but surely instilled a sense that nothing could stop him.   </p>

<p>Israel Adesanya is set to take on Paulo Costa in their UFC 253 title fight on Sunday at Fight Island in Abu Dhabi</p>

<p>The 31-year-old Nigerian-born Kiwi said he was bullied during his younger years at school for being black</p>

<p>In just two years Adesanya has gone from the obscurity of Asia's wild regional fight leagues to a world title and it was after his first win in the UFC – the world's premier mixed martial arts organisation – in Perth back in February 2018 that the fighter first spoke about the hardships he had endured as a child who had arrived in New Zealand aged just 10.</p>

<p>He told the gathered press how he'd been seen as 'a runt' in high school - bullied because of the colour of his skin and his love of dancing and 'nerdy' anime.</p>

<p>A lot has changed since then. </p>

<p>Adesanya explained that he turned to martial arts as a means of defending himself, and to build himself up mentally and physically.</p>

<p>His evolution didn't happen overnight and it's far from over.  </p>

<p>'I'm not done. I'm far from done. You guys haven't even seen the best of me,' Adesanya tells The Daily Mail.</p>

<p>The past 12 months have seen the unbeaten Adesanya (19-0) establish himself as one of the most popular – and marketable – athletes on the planet. He claimed the UFC's middleweight title with a stunning knockout of Australia's Robert Whittaker last October, before defending his belt against Cuban firebrand Yoel Romero back in March.</p>

<p>The UFC champ (pictured as a child) has quickly made his name as one of the best middleweight UFC competitors after growing up in rural New Zealand</p>

<p>He claimed the UFC's middleweight title with a stunning knockout of Australia's Robert Whittaker last October</p>

<p>This weekend Adesanya takes on the toughest contest of his career when he faces the Brazilian wrecking ball Paulo Costa as the headline bout on a monster UFC 253 fight card, being staged at the UFC's 'Fight Island' complex in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>'He's just dangerous,' says Adesanya of Costa. 'That's one thing you have to remember – he's dangerous. But he has to remember … so am I.'</p>

<p>Adesanya's fame has already extended far beyond the mixed martial arts cage where he plies his trade.</p>

<p>Back in February, Adesanya was named New Zealand's Sportsperson of the Year – the first time someone from combat sports has been afforded that honour – while just last week he was named as the face of global sportswear giants Puma's promotions across the Oceania region, again the first time a fighter has been placed in that position.</p>

<p>But it was Adesanya's emotional address at the Black Lives Matter rally at the US embassy in Auckland back in June that reflected just how important his role has now become, across sports globally and across society itself.</p>

<p>Adesanya said he was 'sick and tired' of seeing allegedly racially charged deaths in the United States, and of racism globally.</p>

<p>'[I have a] platform so I have to speak up. I've been doing it for like the last two weeks. You've seen I've been angry,' Adesanya told the rally in a speech that was reported on right around the world.</p>

<p>'I'm sick and tired of seeing those faces get killed because guess what, I see myself in them,' Adesanya said.</p>

<p>Adesanya is dismissive of the notion that he is a role model – or should even be considered one – but believes the time has definitely come for athletes to use their place in the spotlight for the greater good.</p>

<p>'I don't really see why anyone would want to look to me for my take on social issues, or political issues because, first of all, I'm not a politician, I'm a fighter,' says Adesanya. 'But I am also a human, a son of this earth. So I have my own views on things. I don't often share them but when I feel the conviction to, I will. You saw that at the George Floyd/Black Lives Matter protest.</p>

<p>'I think that athletes, not just black athletes but every athlete, should make a stand against what's happening right now in the world. Not just with racism.'</p>

<p>Come Sunday (Australia time), and the UFC's Fight Island base in Abu Dhabi, and Adesanya will be putting his UFC world middleweight title belt on the line against the ferocious 29-year-old Costa, unbeaten at 13-0 and with 11 knockouts to his credit so far.</p>

<p>The lead-up to the event has been embittered, to say the least, with Costa taunting Adesanya as a 'skinny clown' and the Kiwi replying that he thought the Brazilian was an 'overly inflated balloon animal.'</p>

<p>'I don't dwell too much on it [the trash talk],' says Adesanya. 'Ever since we were kids if people don't like each other they talk s*** and eventually they duke it out. But while they're talking s*** it's all part of it. It's all part of fighting.'</p>

<p>In the lead up to the match Costa taunted Adesanya (pictured) as a 'skinny clown' and the Kiwi replied that he thought the Brazilian was an 'overly inflated balloon animal.'</p>

<p>The fighters present an intriguing contrast in styles, with Adesanya famed for his ability to flow through his fights and to pick his opponents off with punches and kicks, and Costa more battering ram than man as he walks forward throwing huge and heavy hands.</p>

<p>Adesanya spent weeks holed up at his City Kickboxing base in Auckland during New Zealand's COVID-19 enforced lockdown. He says the time away from the 'noise' has him focused like never before.</p>

<p>'There was no sense that I had to be here or there. Any business I had to handle I could do online,' he says. 'There was no place to be. I just went back to the simple life. The martial arts life. Wake up, train, eat, sleep. Repeat. It was beautiful.</p>

<p>'Now I just worry about expressing myself and having fun. Winning just comes with that. When I'm having fun I'm the best in the world.'</p>

<p>The highly anticipated fight between Adesanya and Costo will kick off on Sunday in Australian and New Zealand time on Yas Island in Abu Dhabi.</p>

<p>Australians can watch the fight on Main Event, with the main card to start at midday Sunday (AEDT)</p>
