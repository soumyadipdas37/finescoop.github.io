<p>The devoutly Christian star reflected on how fame changed him in a recent Instagram caption, telling fans how his journey from small town boy to superstar affected him. </p>

<p>'I came from a small town in Stratford Ontario Canada,' he explained. 'I didn’t have material things and was never motivated by money or fame I just loved music. But as I became a teenager I let my insecurities and frustrations dictate what I put my value in.'</p>

<p>'My values slowly started to change. Ego and power started to takeover and my relationships suffered because of it. I truly desire healthy relationships. I want to be motivated by truth and love. I want to be aware of my blind spots and learn from them!'</p>

<p>'I want to walk in the plans God has for me and not try and do it on my own! I want to give up my selfish desires daily so I can be a good husband and future dad! I’m grateful that I can walk with Jesus as he leads the way.'</p>

<p>Holy is set for release Friday, September 18th.  </p>
