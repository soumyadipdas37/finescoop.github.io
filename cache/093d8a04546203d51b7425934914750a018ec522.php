<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Gary Neville has become the latest Manchester United legend to slam the club's current regime, calling the hierarchy 'negligent' for their lack of transfer action.</p>

<p>While the other top Premier League clubs have all strengthened, United have only brought in Donny van de Beek and were well beaten in their opening fixture at home to Crystal Palace.</p>

<p>Patrice Evra is among the former players to have hit out at the club, while Luke Shaw is among the current squad to have also called for United to make signings in order to 'keep up' with their big-spending rivals. </p>

<p>Gary Neville has hit out at Manchester United's failure to sign over one player this summer</p>

<p>Ed Woodward is chief executive at United but he has come under fire from plenty of legends</p>

<p>Neville has become the latest outspoken United legend to divulge his thoughts, writing in his column for Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'You see Liverpool getting a player for £40m, £25m, you see other clubs do it,' Neville said. 'Werner is quite cheap compared to some of the prices of players you see in the market and United always seem to have to pay top dollar and the people at the club will not like that, almost as though they are easy pickings. And there is a suggestion of that.</p>

<p>'The problem is, they have to find a way to get deals done and they can't get deals done efficiently. And it is negligence not to get the squad in place, they have had six months since March when lockdown was on being able to deliberate, do zoom calls, connect with agents, move things into place.</p>

<p>There is no excuse really for not getting your transfers done before the start of the season. They need four or five players, so to only get one done… I know Liverpool have only got theirs done in the last couple of days, but there is a feeling they are in control.'</p>

<p>Donny van de Beek is the only arrival at Old Trafford in the summer window, costing £40m</p>

<p>Patrice Evra also launched a stunning attack on his old club Manchester United on Instagram</p>

<p>Van de Beek cost the club £40m, but the ongoing saga with Borussia Dortmund's Jadon Sancho has dominated the headlines since the window opened.</p>

<p>'United have got the money - if they can spend £90m-100m on Sancho, they have got the money to do the deals,' Neville continued. 'They have not got the quality or experience of football people within that club, it looks like a convoluted and complex structure, I'm not quite sure where the decisions lie.</p>

<p>'Liverpool are definite, they are precise. Look at Chelsea, they are definite and precise, Man City are, but Man United do not seem able to get their business done. And that unfortunately has been a massive problem.' </p>

<p>The elongated transfer saga of Jadon Sancho has dominated the headlines but he's stayed put</p>

<p>Other top clubs, meanwhile, have signed the likes of Timo Werner (left) and Thiago Alcantara</p>
