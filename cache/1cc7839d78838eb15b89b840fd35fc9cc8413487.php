<p>Diggs, 51, co-wrote and produced almost all of the ten-member band's albums, as well as several solo efforts by its members. </p>

<p>Some of Wu-Tang Clan's top hits have included Protect Ya Neck, C.R.E.A.M. and Bring Da Ruckus. Diggs went on to work with other artists as well, including Kanye West and Jay-Z. </p>

<p>Hipgnosis was founded by 56-year-old Canadian-born Merck Mercuriadis and invests in song rights, as well as other intellectual property associated with music, which it then licenses to third parties. </p>

<p>Mercuriadis said: 'Wu-Tang Clan were and are the most authentic band and brand in hip-hop and it all starts with RZA's vision, his songs and his struggle, manifested in music, that could show the entire world what was really going on.'</p>
