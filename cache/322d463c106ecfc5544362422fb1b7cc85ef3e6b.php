<p>Jenna Karvunidis took to social media Monday to call on people to stop the celebrations after it emerged a gender reveal pyrotechnic caused the massive El Dorado wildfire</p>

<p>Karvunidis slammed the 'tool' responsible for the latest blaze in a Facebook rant Monday.</p>

<p>'Oh my god NO. The fire that evacuated parts of California is from a GENDER REVEAL PARTY,' the blogger wrote. </p>

<p>'Stop it. Stop having these stupid parties. For the love of God, stop burning things down to tell everyone about your kid's penis. No one cares but you.'</p>

<p>The blogger branded the need to use pyrotechnics in a gender reveal as 'toxic masculinity' and pointed to the vast difference between their actions and her own when she unveiled her baby's gender with a cake back in 2008.  </p>

<p>'It was 116 degrees in Pasadena yesterday and this tool thought it would be smart to light a fire about his kid's d**k,' she wrote.</p>

<p>'Toxic masculinity is men thinking they need to explode something because simply enjoying a baby party is for sissies.</p>

<p>'Oh, and of course I'm getting hate messages. Excuse me for having a cake for my family in 2008.'</p>

<p>She added: Just because I'm the gender reveal inventor doesn't mean I think people should burn down their communities. STOP.'</p>

<p>April 2017 - A gender reveal sparked the massive Sawmill Fire which scorched more than 45,000 acres across Arizona.</p>

<p>Partygoers shot a makeshift target labeled with the words 'boy' and 'girl' which then exploded setting fire to the brush.</p>

<p>The off-duty border patrol agent responsible for starting the fire pleaded guilty and was ordered to pay more than $8 million in restitution.</p>

<p>October 2019 - Partygoers made a homemade 'pipe bomb' to release blue or pink gun powder at a gender reveal in Iowa. </p>

<p>September 2020 - A gender reveal pyrotechnical smoke device started the El Dorado wildfire in southern California. </p>

<p>Fire officials described the blaze as 'one of the most dangerous fires' they've ever seen.  </p>

<p>Fire officials described the blaze as 'one of the most dangerous fires' they've ever seen. </p>

<p>The fire started on Saturday at 10.23am, authorities said, before spreading from the El Dorado Ranch Park north, onto the Yucaipa Ridge. </p>

<p>The ridge separates Mountain Home Village and Forest Falls from the City of Yucaipa.</p>

<p>Bennet Milloy, spokesman for the fire department, told DailyMail.com the people hosting the party were still on the scene when the firefighters arrived.</p>

<p>'We know how it started because they were still there,' he said. 'That, and the fact that there were surveillance cameras in the park.'</p>

<p>Milloy said that it was a relatively small family gathering, and that the relatives had gathered for a photo opportunity. </p>

<p>He did not know if they were local people, but he said they were potentially both civilly and criminally responsible for the fire and could face jail time and hefty fines. </p>

<p>The family could be held responsible for the entire cost of putting the fire out, amounting to many millions of dollars, he said.</p>

<p>The civil costs were deemed 'suppression costs' - the charges associated with hundreds of fire fighters, engines, helicopters and planes.</p>

<p>The criminal charges could fall under 'a variety of charges', he said - which would be more severe if homes were destroyed. </p>

<p>The family could be hit with violations of public resources codes and even arson, under California's penal code section 452. </p>

<p>Arson convictions can result in a sentence of up to nine years.</p>

<p>Milloy did not have the names of the family, but said they would be released if charges were pressed.</p>
