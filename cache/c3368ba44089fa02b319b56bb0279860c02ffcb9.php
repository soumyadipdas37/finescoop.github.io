<p>Liverpool youngster Rhian Brewster wants to hold talks with Crystal Palace about a move</p>

<p>After scoring 11 goals in 22 appearances on loan at Swansea last season, Brewster was hopeful that he would be afforded an opportunity to impress at Liverpool.</p>

<p>Palace are eager to secure a deal for Brewster, who could cost £20million plus add-ons</p>

<p>However, the Reds are prepared to let him depart, with Palace attempting to secure a fee that could rise to £20million plus add-ons.</p>

<p>Liverpool want to include a buy-back clause in any deal for Brewster but Palace are reluctant to comply with that request. </p>
