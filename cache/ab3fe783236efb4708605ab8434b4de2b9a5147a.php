<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Leeds United have confirmed that boss Marcelo Bielsa has signed a one-year contract extension at the club on his £6million package. </p>

<p>The Argentine was out of contract this summer but has now committed his future to the club ahead of the newly-promoted side's first season back in the Premier League for 16 years.</p>

<p>The 65-year-old - whose side start their campaign at champions Liverpool on Saturday - has taken charge of a total of 100 games for Leeds since joining in 2018, winning 56, drawing 17 and losing 27 games.</p>

<p>Leeds United have confirmed boss Marcelo Bielsa has signed a one-year contract extension</p>

<p>The 65-year-old will lead the club in the Premier League after winning the Championship</p>

<p>Last season he guided Leeds to the Championship title as they finished 10 points clear of West Brom and created history in the club's centenary campaign.</p>

<p>The official confirmation comes after Bielsa revealed during his pre-match press conference ahead of their opener against Jurgen Klopp's men that he will remain for a third season at Elland Road.</p>

<p>'I will be working the next season at Leeds United,' he said. 'Everything has been sorted and I'll definitely be here next season.'</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed on Thursday that Bielsa's salary also covers the wages of his backroom team and the complexity of such an arrangement has added to the delay.</p>

<p>The Argentine and his side will face Liverpool in their first top-flight game for 16 years</p>

<p>Moreover, the 65-year-old's attention to detail in the terms of his contract has been the primary reason why it has taken seven weeks to finalise since the end of last season.</p>

<p>Asked about the delay, he said: '(To make sure) that the club had the necessary structures to compete at an adequate level. This is in reference to logistics, the academy, health and maintenance of the institution.</p>

<p>'I had to make sure all areas of the club were running how they should.'</p>
