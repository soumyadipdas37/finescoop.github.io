<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p> The weekly shop is a more stressful affair these days — and not just because we have to contend with panic-buying customers stockpiling essentials.</p>

<p>Confusing new one-way systems designed to help people stay distanced, plus the added discomfort of wearing a mask, mean many shoppers are keen to grab their groceries and get out of the store as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>But experts have warned that the new restrictions could be working to our disadvantage.</p>

<p>Aisle help: To make sure that you don't miss savings, we hit the shops to find out where you should look for the very best prices </p>

<p>We have probably all experienced putting something in our trolley only to find a near-identical product cheaper elsewhere in the store.</p>

<p>'Supermarkets group items on shelves according to the consumer's specific needs,' says Ratula Chakraborty, professor of business management at the University of East Anglia. </p>

<p>'The prices charged will reflect consumers' willingness to pay — and that can differ based on their needs.'</p>

<p>This is why it is often more expensive to buy a packet of dried fruit in the health food section than in the baking section, for instance.</p>

<p>Nuts, likewise, can normally be found in the 'meal deal' aisle, health food aisle or crisps aisle, but are also usually cheapest in the baking section.</p>

<p>To take a third example, when you buy fruit juice from the chilled drinks section, it's only worth paying more if you are buying a fresh product (such as freshly squeezed orange juice). </p>

<p>Shops also stock 'from concentrate' juices in the fridge — but the same product can usually be bought cheaper in the unrefrigerated soft drinks section at the back of the store.</p>

<p>Because of Covid, it is much now harder to browse for the best price - and one-way systems mean you can't easily return to an aisle if something you need was cheaper there</p>

<p>Professor Chakraborty adds: 'There can often be bargains in the ethnic foods aisle, which many shoppers overlook because they are generally in a hurry and tend to stick to aisles that are familiar to them, rather than exploring the whole shop.'</p>

<p>Staples such as tins of chopped tomatoes and kidney beans are often cheaper in this section than in the tinned food aisle.</p>

<p>But because of Covid, it is now much harder to browse for the best price — and one-way systems mean you can't easily return to an aisle if something you need was cheaper there.</p>

<p>Supermarkets may also package products slightly differently or use varying size packs, which makes comparing prices even harder, adds Professor Chakraborty.</p>

<p>We asked the supermarkets why they priced their products differently in different aisles, and most claimed that the prices reflected the varying sizes.</p>

<p>A Waitrose spokesman says: 'In some cases these products are different, and some of our larger pack sizes offer customers better value for money.'</p>

<p>And a Sainsbury's spokesman says: 'We are focused on offering our customers the best possible choice, quality and value.</p>

<p>'Sometimes bigger packs offer better value for customers, as is the case with our own-brand walnuts, for example.'</p>
