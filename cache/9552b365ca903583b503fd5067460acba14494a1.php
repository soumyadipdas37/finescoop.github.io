<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A man caught violently bashing his pet bullmastiff with a wooden plank on camera has been fined and disqualified from owning dogs for the next three years.</p>

<p>Owner Murray Johnson was sentenced at the Christchurch District Court on Wednesday after admitting to the cruel attack last September, which left Bolo - his former pet - with internal injuries and significant bruises.</p>

<p>The horrific incident was captured on camera by a witness, who saw Johnson raise a wooden plank above his head and smack the dog with it.</p>

<p>Moments later Bolo was yelping loudly in pain, after his owner admitted 'losing it' when Bolo escaped through a gate and was found attempting to fight another dog.</p>

<p>Bolo was found to have a bleeding wound on his face below the right eye as a result of the incident, and he needed stitches for a puncture wound on his lower right lip, which pushed into a tooth.</p>

<p>Bolo was also found to have limited movement in his shoulders as well as elevated creatine kinase levels in his blood.</p>

<p>The dog was seized by SPCA inspectors when carrying out a search warrant following police attending in the location of the attack later on in the day. </p>

<p>A veterinary examination showed Bolo had muscle damage from the attack as well as trauma around his kidney. </p>

<p>The plank police seized was found to have blood on it and could have injured Bolo more severely if it was not for his large, muscular body.  </p>

<p>SPCA CEO Andrea Midgen said physical punishment was not the answer to an animal displaying signs of unwanted behaviour.</p>

<p>'Instead, an owner should train their dog to respond to positive reinforcement of good behaviours, use lots of praise and have patience with their animal,' she said in a statement on the SPCA website.</p>

<p>The NZ Herald reported Johnson was sentenced to 150 hours' community work and a $1,500 fine payable to SPCA.</p>

<p>He was also disqualified for three years from owning dogs.</p>

<p>Bolo's ownership has been surrendered to the SPCA and he has been listed as available for adoption. </p>
