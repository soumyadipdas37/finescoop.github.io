<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A black bear was caught on camera acrobatically balancing on the edge of a barbecue to steal a piece of meat from an unsuspecting family. </p>

<p>The footage was recorded in the municipality of Santiago, Nuevo Leon, in the western part of Mexico.</p>

<p>The family had hired a rural property to enjoy some time in the countryside but had not counted on the arrival of the unexpected visitor.</p>

<p>In the clip, which is about a minute long, the hungry bear can be seen standing precariously on the edge of the built-in barbecue as meat sizzles on the grill. </p>

<p>It outstretches its paw to scoop up some of the supplies as members of the shocked family laugh nervously and shout: 'Bear! No! No!' </p>

<p>The wild animal looks around casually but is undeterred and reaches down once again.</p>

<p>This time it knocks off a metal pan, full of already grilled meat, which clatters noisily to the ground.</p>

<p>The family helplessly look at each other in disbelief as one says 'look at the claws' and another adds 'he is hungry'. </p>

<p>The bear then snatches up a mouthful of meat before jumping down from the wall where it is joined by a younger cub as the pair feast on the meal.</p>

<p>'He only wanted a piece' says one woman as another adds: 'Dad, don't get close! Don't you understand he is eating?'</p>

<p>Since the pandemic began, it is more common to see black bears roaming around various parts of Mexico, according to the Mexican Newspaper Excelsior.</p>

<p>It is thought that because there are fewer people on the streets, due to coronavirus restrictions, more wild animals are taking a chance to venture into built up areas. </p>

<p>Mexico has registered 680,931 cases of COVID-19 and 71,978 related deaths, according to the latest figures from the Johns Hopkins University.</p>
