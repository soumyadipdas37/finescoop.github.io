<p>Stand by your man: Jessica Chastain will be playing Tammy Wynette in an upcoming limited series about her relationship with ex husband George Jones</p>

<p>George &amp; Tammy is being based off the book The Three Of Us: Growing Up With Tammy And George written by the couple's daughter Georgette Jones. </p>

<p>It will follow the couple's tumultuous six year marriage, which inspired some of country music's greatest songs about heartbreak, including duets We're Gonna Hold On, Golden Ring and Near You. They were wed from 1969 to 1975.</p>

<p>Tammy's song Stand By Your Man is one of the best selling country singles by a female artist, cementing her title as the First Lady Of Country Music. Wynette passed away in 1998, with 20 number one songs to her name.</p>

<p>George &amp; Tammy will be available exclusively for Spectrum subscribers for nine months before finding its way to ViacomCBS' forthcoming streaming service and Paramount Network.</p>

<p>Katherine Pope, head of Spectrum Originals, said: 'I first read Abe's feature script a few years ago and couldn't get it out of my head — the examination of human frailty and redemption was so unexpected, given the glitz and glamour of the subject matter.'</p>
