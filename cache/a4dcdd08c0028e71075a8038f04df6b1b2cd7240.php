<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She is a successful actress and he is a blue-blooded aristocrat – so it’s good to learn that Cressida Bonas and new hubby Harry Wentworth-Stanley can be just as frugal as the rest of us.</p>

<p>The newlyweds shaved a bob or two off their dinner bill thanks to the Chancellor’s Eat Out To Help Out scheme. </p>

<p>It was one of the most exclusive selfie spots of all – but Annabel’s nightclub has now banned members from snapping pouty poses in its powder rooms. </p>

<p>The loos were the only area where guests were allowed to take pictures after a £55 million club makeover – and 25,000 selfies were taken. But new rules forbid cameras anywhere in the club ‘including bathrooms’. </p>
