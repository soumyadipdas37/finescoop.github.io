<p>The Red Bull driver finished the weekend's racing in third spot, 15 seconds behind the Mercedes champion and seven seconds behind runner-up Valtteri Bottas. </p>

<p>There was some drama on the track as British driver George Russell collided with the loose wheel of Alfa Romeo driver Antonio Giovinazzi, with the British driver left unhurt, but Verstappen was not entertained on Sunday. </p>

<p>Max Verstappen (left) was bored during the Belgian Grand Prix, where he finished third</p>

<p>The Red Bull driver finished 15 seconds behind champions Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes</p>

<p>After the race, he said: 'It was pretty boring to be honest, not very interesting. </p>

<p>'I couldn't really keep up with them when (Mercedes) were pushing and from my side I had to get the car to the end so the last eight or so laps I was just backing it out and saving the front tyres. </p>

<p>'It was not really enjoyable out there. On the medium (tyre) I didn't really have a lot of grip and on the hard tyre, yeah, initially I was trying to put a bit of pressure on Valtteri (Bottas) but they told him to speed up and I couldn't keep up. So, yeah bit lonely. </p>

<p>Verstappen claims he was close to having a puncture and ran out of tyres towards the end</p>

<p>Victory for Hamilton (middle) increases his lead at the top of the World Drivers Championship</p>

<p>'I think I was very close to a puncture but more than that was not possible today. It was not the most satisfying victory but it is better than nothing. </p>

<p>'We had no tyres left and I was not taking any risks. We maximised what we could.'</p>

<p>Victory for Hamilton has extended his lead at the top of the World Drivers' Championship leaderboard as he closes in on his seventh title. </p>

<p>He also achieved his 89th pole on Sunday, meaning he is just two behind Michael Schumacher's all-time record of 91. </p>

<p>The drivers will take to the track again next weekend for the Italian Grand Prix, with the victor decided on September 6 in Monza, Milan.  </p>
