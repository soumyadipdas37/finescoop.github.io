<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A pub manager has revealed he is struggling to fill job applications as candidates would rather earn money through JobSeeker.</p>

<p>Max Fox-Andrews runs The Windsor Hotel in South Perth in Western Australia and has six job applications he cannot fill.</p>

<p>The hotel is looking to hire bartenders, chefs and waitresses ahead of the busy summer hospitality season.</p>

<p>Mr Fox-Andrews said the pub would normally need to wade through more than 400 applicants for these jobs, but with increased government payments from the coronavirus pandemic, he is struggling for suitors.</p>

<p>Max Fox-Andrews from Perth's Windsor Hotel (pictured) said he is struggling to find staff</p>

<p>'At this time of year we tend to up our staff for the Christmas period and usually we wouldn't have a problem encouraging staff to come and work for us,' he told Sunrise.</p>

<p>'But what we've seen is a decline in applications and a decline in decent staff with experience apply to us. It's been a tough run.'</p>

<p>The Windsor Hotel is among many Australian businesses striving for staff, despite unemployment rates reaching their highest mark since 1998.</p>

<p>The National Skills Commission survey found from 1,100 businesses contacted, 47 per cent were having difficulties finding staff.</p>

<p>Thousands of Australians have been left out of work through COVID-19 and are receiving JobKeeper and JobSeeker payments, which Mr Fox-Andrews believes is preventing people from applying for jobs.</p>

<p>'We are seeing an element of people not wanting to work because the money is slightly better with JobSeeker,' he said.</p>

<p>Mr Fox-Andrews (pictured) hopes the JobSeeker payment reduction will inspire people to start work</p>

<p>Jobseeker payments combined with Newstart has welfare recipients claiming about $1,100 per fortnight from the government. </p>

<p>Mr Fox-Andrews said students who would regularly fill the positions advertised are receiving a better offer by not working.</p>

<p>'Students see sometimes that JobSeeker is a better way of earning more money because they can obviously only do limited shifts,' he said. </p>

<p>The business have been trying several avenues to encourage prospective workers to apply, including a $250 cash bonus for staff who stay in the job for more than three months.</p>

<p>Mr Fox-Andrews hopes the drop in the JobSeeker fortnightly payment from $550 to $250 on Friday will inspire Australians back into the workforce.</p>

<p>Mr Fox-Andrews claimed prospective workers would rather get JobSeeker payments than work. Pictured: a large queue grows outside Centrelink in Melbourne</p>
