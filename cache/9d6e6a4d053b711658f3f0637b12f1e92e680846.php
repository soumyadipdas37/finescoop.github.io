<p>Ian Hamer, 54, was convicted on Friday after a three-week trial at Hull Crown Court and was jailed for life.  </p>

<p>Ian Hamer, 54, (pictured right) was convicted on Friday after a three-week trial at Hull Crown Court and was jailed for life after murdering wife Joanne (left) </p>

<p>He went drinking after committing the crime and was spotted and pursued by a policeman who tackled and arrested him. </p>

<p>He had subjected Joanne to over two years of domestic abuse, controlling her every move, spying on her and isolating her from friends and family.</p>

<p>Joanne was a well respected public health official with North Lincolnshire Council, popular with colleagues and described by family as a 'beautiful, kind and loving lady'.</p>

<p>Hamer had claimed Joanne was untrue to him and having affairs, but days before her death was texting another woman trying to arrange a meeting.  </p>

<p>Hamer claimed he was 'taunted' by Joanne before he killed her at their home and said she had told him one of their daughters was not his - something there was no evidence for.</p>

<p>The former store manager had evaded arrest for 24-hours after strangling Joanne Hamer with a dressing gown cord at their home in Worlaby, North Lincolnshire</p>

<p>After carrying out the crime Hamer rang Joanne's terminally ill mother, telling her Joanne had a bad throat and would not be calling her that day, something the judge described as 'sadistic.'</p>

<p>He then went to a pub and laughed and joked as he embarked on a drink and drug binge.</p>

<p>He then wandered the countryside of North Lincolnshire before being found and arrested five miles away in a car park in Barton-upon-Humber.</p>

<p>He was tackled to the ground in the car park off Finkle Lane by a lone policeman who sat on him for more than five minutes after calling for backup.</p>

<p>Uniformed officers deployed to search for Hamer arrived and he was arrested and taken to a police van. </p>

<p>Soon after his arrest, Hamer said: 'I want to say it's manslaughter by diminished responsibility due to insanity.' </p>

<p>During the sentencing, a statement from Joanne's late mother, who died in August last year was read out by her son and Joanne's twin brother.</p>

<p>She said: 'Jo's death has left us heartbroken. </p>

<p>'Ian has taken a loving daughter away from her mum she was caring for and a mum away from her children leaving the family broken. </p>

<p>'She will never see her children get married or see the grandchildren she so wanted. Her daughters will miss the love and support only a mum can give.    </p>

<p>'Jo was a beautiful, kind and loving lady and always saw the best in people. She stayed with Ian even though she was begged to leave him. </p>

<p>He went drinking after committing the crime and was spotted and pursued by a policeman who tackled and arrested him (pictured) </p>

<p>'I find it difficult to understand how someone can kill someone like Jo. </p>

<p>Judge Peter Kelson QC described Hamer as a 'danger to women'.</p>

<p>He said: 'It is clear having heard all of the evidence that everyone who knew Joanne knew her as a loyal, loving, caring long-suffering wife who was true to her vows. </p>

<p>'She couldn't have worked harder at marriage. You were an overbearing, violent, domineering, aggressive husband and father.</p>

<p>'You were thought by your neighbour to be a man who didn't like women. Your stalking behaviour didn't arise from your love of Joanne. </p>

<p>You told a psychiatrist you never stopped loving Joanne but I do not believe your behaviour came from love but a desire to control her and your love of money.</p>

<p>'You said you wanted to say it's manslaughter based on diminished responsibility due to insanity. </p>

<p>Soon after his arrest, Hamer said: 'I want to say it's manslaughter by diminished responsibility due to insanity' </p>

<p>'Well Mr Hamer that was your last act of control and manipulation for many, many years.'</p>

<p>Cries from Joanne's family members rang out through the court as Hamer was led by a dock officer to the cells below, showing no emotion or remorse for the life he claimed to have loved but taken.</p>

<p>Reacting to Hamer's sentence, Senior Investigating Officer Detective Chief Inspector Christine Calvert said: 'My thoughts remain with Joanne's family and friends today and I want to thank them for their understanding and patience throughout the investigation and court proceedings. </p>

<p>'Joanne was a kind, loving mother and wife who endured years of mental and physical abuse at the hands of her abusive husband.</p>

<p>'I hope today's conclusion allows Joanne's family to feel that some sense of justice has been achieved for their loved one.</p>

<p>'Hamer is a violent man who has shown no remorse for taking the life of the woman he was supposed to love and care for. </p>

<p>Joanne (pictured) was a well respected public health official with North Lincolnshire Council, popular with colleagues and described by family as a 'beautiful, kind and loving lady'</p>

<p>'Joanne had suffered mental and physical abuse at the hands of Hamer, who monitored her phones, checking who she spoke to and where she went, controlling her movements even when she was at work.</p>

<p>'It is something that we take incredibly seriously and I would encourage anyone who is a victim or has concerns about a loved one to contact us.</p>

<p>'We would always encourage anyone who feels they may be a victim of domestic abuse to please, come forward and report it to us. </p>
