<p>In May, the comedian said he was 'extraordinarily lucky' to have his role on The Project as his main source of income amid the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>'I do a fair bit of corporate work [emceeing and public speaking] and that's all gone this year. And I probably only got through a third of my stand-up tour,' Peter told The Sydney Morning Herald.</p>

<p>'That said, I'm extraordinarily lucky. The Project is my major income.'   </p>
