<p>Speaking on Thursday's Lorraine, Dermot said: 'It was a very odd time to have a kid but at the same time it gave you that enforced time to be with him.</p>

<p>'So I was able to take a lot more paternity than I probably would have been able to normally. </p>

<p>He said: 'We went out for dinner which was a novelty as well. Normally going out for dinner would be a lovely thing, but something you take for granted. </p>

<p>'It was so nice to be able to go out to a restaurant. We got so excited about the mundane things. </p>

<p>'Someone brought us bread and butter to start and we were like, ''Thank you SO much, this is so nice of you''. We were so excited about having a little bread and butter to start.' </p>

<p>It's been claimed that the singing series may not return to screens in 2021, after Simon Cowell previously announced it would be taking a year-long hiatus.</p>

<p>Dermot also updated fans on the whereabouts of his wedding ring, after it was stolen while he was exercising in the gym.</p>

<p>He said: 'If it annoys you Lorraine then it must be bad. It was a real shame… fingers crossed he'll get caught. </p>

<p>'He broke into my locker and took my whole bag and obviously that had everything in it. I always take my wedding ring and jewellery off in case it gets snagged.'</p>
