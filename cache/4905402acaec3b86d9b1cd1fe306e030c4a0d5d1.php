<p>Loving life: She became the first star voted off Celebrity Karaoke Club. Yet Tallia Storm still seemed to be in high spirits as she enjoyed a night out in London on Wednesday</p>

<p>Tallia poured her curves into a skintight pink corset dress with a low-cut neckline that showcased her cleavage. </p>

<p>She teamed the garment with a pair of thigh high silver boots and a fringed glitterball clutch bag. </p>

<p>Her trademark curly blonde locks were worn swept back in a ponytail, allowing a look at her gold hooped earrings.  </p>

<p>Think pink! Dressed to impress for the occasion, the 21-year-old Scottish beauty ensured all eyes would remain firmly on her</p>

<p>Tallia's night out coincided with the launch of Celebrity Karaoke Club, which sees a bunch of stars hoping to impress each other with their vocals and stay in the competition.  </p>

<p>In between the rounds the stars can either grab a cocktail at the bar or gossip about their rivals in the toilets.</p>

<p>The celebrities have to form alliances with their fellow competitors in the hope their popularity will propel them to victory. </p>
