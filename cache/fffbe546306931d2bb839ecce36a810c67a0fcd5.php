<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Fans of The Bachelor are convinced that Irena Srbinovska is going to win Locky Gilbert's heart during Thursday night's finale.</p>

<p>And while she is the clear favourite as of Wednesday, there is still a chance that Bella Varelis could swoop in and steal her crown.</p>

<p>As longtime viewers will know, the bookies aren't always right when it comes to who wins The Bachelor - and this was memorably the case during the 2016 season.</p>

<p>What if we're all wrong about Bella? The Bachelor's resident 'villain' Bella Varelis could still win Locky Gilbert's heart despite the odds not being in her favour - because it's happened before</p>

<p>In the days leading up to Richie Strahan's dramatic season finale, runner-up Nikki Gogan was the odds-on favourite.</p>

<p>As reported by Daily Mail Australia at the time, a leading online betting agency was offering $1.70 for Nikki being the outright winner.</p>

<p>The eventual winner, single mother Alex Nation, was sitting on longer odds $2.05 - despite having been the favourite earlier in the season.</p>

<p>It's not over yet: While Irena Srbinovska (pictured) is the clear favourite as of Wednesday, there is still a chance that Bella could swoop in and steal her crown</p>

<p>But the bookmakers were wrong: Richie ended up picking single mother Alex, and left real estate agent Nikki heartbroken.</p>

<p>This shock twist raises the possibility that the bookies - and much of the Australian media - have got this year's outcome wrong, too.</p>

<p>According to Sportsbet, 31-year-old recovery nurse Irena is the clear favourite as of Wednesday morning with odds of $1.27.</p>

<p>Surprise! As longtime viewers will know, the bookies aren't always right when it comes to who wins The Bachelor - and this was memorably the case during the 2016 season. Despite being tipped for runner-up, Alex Nation (left) ended up winning Richie Strahan's (right) heart</p>

<p>By contrast, Instagram influencer Bella, 25, is tipped for runner-up ($3.50) and intruder Bec Cvilikas, 25, is expected to place third ($9).</p>

<p>HR consultant Izzy Sharman-Firth, 29, is likely to be the first to go when finale week kicks off on Wednesday, with odds of $21.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10 </p>
