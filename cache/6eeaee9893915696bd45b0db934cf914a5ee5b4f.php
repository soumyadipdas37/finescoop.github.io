<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hurricane Sally has left widespread devastation in its wake after battering southern Alabama and the Florida panhandle with 105mph winds, a surge of seawater and more than 2 feet of rain, killing at least two people and leaving more than a half-million homes and businesses in the dark.</p>

<p>Dramatic drone footage has emerged showing the scale of the damage wrought by Sally in multiple states, including the Gulf Coast of Alabama, the Florida panhandle and coastal Georgia. </p>

<p>And the region is now facing a new threat in the form of a tropical depression, which has formed in the Gulf Coast and was expected to strengthen to a tropical storm and take aim at coastal Texas in the coming days.  </p>

<p>Video from hard-hit Pensacola, Florida, showed at least 30 sailboats, fishing boats and other vessels clumped together in a mass of fiberglass hulls and broken docks at a downtown marina. Some boats rested atop sunken ones. </p>

<p>FLORIDA: Some 30 boats are seen clumped together in a mass of fiberglass hulls and broken docks at a marina in downtown Pensacola, Florida, after Hurricane Sally</p>

<p>A section of the main bridge between Pensacola and Pensacola Beach collapsed after it was hit by a barge that broke loose during the storm. </p>

<p>Sally’s floodwaters had coursed through downtown streets, washing  away sections of roads, and lapped at car door handles on Wednesday before receding, authorities went door-to-door to check on residents and warn them they were not out of danger. </p>

<p>'Please, please, we’re not out of the woods even if we’ve got beautiful skies today,' said Escambia County emergency manager Eric Gilmore.</p>

<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis urged Panhandle residents not to let their guard down. 'You’re going to see the rivers continue to rise,' DeSantis said after an aerial tour of the Panhandle. </p>

<p>Rescuers on the Gulf Coast used boats and high-water vehicles Thursday to reach people cut off by floodwaters in the aftermath of Hurricane Sally, even as a second round of flooding took shape along rivers and creeks swollen by the storm’s heavy rains.</p>

<p>Crews carried out at least 400 rescues in Escambia County, Florida, by such means as high-water vehicles, boats and water scooters, authorities said. Rescuers focused their efforts Thursday on Innerarity Point, a narrow strip of land close to Pensacola that is home to waterfront homes and businesses. Floodwaters covered the only road out.</p>

<p>Richard Wittig and his family were among scores of people hemmed in by floodwaters on an island at the tip of the point. Two generators powered his house.</p>

<p>A volunteer rescue group based on Marcos Island, Florida, known as the Marcos Patriots, received three calls for help, including from an 80-year-old woman in Gulf Shores, Alabama, whose roof had blown off.</p>

<p>When a rescue team arrived, 'she was safe and sound with a neighbor but her house was destroyed,' said group co-founder ErinMia Milchman.</p>

<p>About 35 miles inland, a swollen Murder Creek cut off access between the Alabama towns of Brewton and East Brewton, inundating a grocery store, a tobacco shop, a park and more. Residents behind a police roadblock gazed at the neighboring city across fast-moving water covering a bridge.</p>

<p>East Brewton resident Brenda Davenport said it took only four hours for the water to rise. 'It could take two days for it to go down,' she said.</p>

<p>In Orange Beach, Alabama, Janice Sullivan swore she would never ride out a hurricane again. She and her daughter huddled in a second-floor bathroom as Sally blew ashore.</p>

<p>'You could hear everything hitting the house,' she said. 'You could hear the house moving back and forth. It was literally moaning and cracking.'</p>

<p>On Thursday, the National Hurricane Center warned that a new tropical depression - dubbed depression 22 - formed in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico. </p>

<p>Forecasters said the depression could become Tropical Storm Alpha as it moves slowly over the western Gulf during the next few days. The storm is projected to slow down and turn west toward the Texas Gulf Coast. It could turn into a hurricane by Sunday. </p>
