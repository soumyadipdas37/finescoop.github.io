<p>She also shared a photo of the whole family together, captioning it: 'Our king. Our hero. Our superman. Love you'. </p>

<p>Rebecca and Chris have been married for ten years and share four young children together. </p>

<p>Baby love: Bec posted a photo of Chris bathing one of the pair's four children as a baby. She captioned the image: 'Happy Father's Day baby daddy. No idea who you're bathing here but you're nailing it as always'</p>

<p>She also shared a photo of the whole family together, captioning it: 'Our king. Our hero. Our superman. Love you'</p>

<p>The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins Tom and Darcy, both aged three.   </p>

<p>Bec explained on her KIIS FM radio show, the 3pm Pick-up, that she and Chris split early in their relationship. </p>

<p>'When [Chris] Juddy and I were first hooking up when we were, I think about 19. We had only been hooking up for a little bit.</p>

<p> All together: The couple are parents to son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and toddler twins Tom and Darcy, both aged three</p>

<p>'He had this event to go to and I wasn't really expecting to be invited to that event because we'd only just got together. But I wasn't expecting him to invite his ex-girlfriend instead of me!' </p>

<p>According to Bec, she was so 'heartbroken', she almost broke up with him at the time.</p>

<p>'It totally set us back I reckon another five or six months. So him and I were on-and-off for 18 months because none of us could actually tell each other what we were really thinking, even though we were mad for each other,' she revealed.</p>

<p> Long time! Rebecca and Chris have been married for ten years </p>
