<p>During their conference, Worcester Diocese members were subjected to a barrage of offensive content while a voice repeatedly shouted 'motherf***ers.'</p>

<p>They were also urged to 'convert to Islam' before images showing four men engaging in a sex act also flashed up on their screen.   </p>

<p>In a video posted to YouTube, which has since been removed, elderly church members were seen reacting in horror when their conference was gatecrashed by the hackers on September 21. </p>

<p>Worcester Diocese members were left mortified after a group of hackers infiltrated their Zoom meeting and subjected them to a barrage of offensive content</p>

<p>The Diocese has apologised to parishioners who witnessed the 'unpleasant and distressing' content and said they have now stepped up their online security measures.</p>

<p>A spokesman said: 'We are currently running a series of meetings on Zoom to enable people from our churches across Worcestershire and Dudley to become involved in the future plans for our Diocese.</p>

<p>'Anyone is welcome to attend and although we keep a list, we don't always know all those who have signed up.</p>

<p>'Unfortunately at our meeting on Monday, several people were admitted who shared some offensive and disturbing content on both their profile pictures and in the chat line.</p>

<p>'We removed a number of people immediately, but one remained undetected and therefore we took the decision to end the meeting.</p>

<p>'As a result we have increased our security and changed our processes and are confident that all future meetings can go ahead without any further issues.</p>

<p>'We held a meeting on Tuesday evening with no problems. </p>

<p>Since the beginning of lockdown earlier this year there has been an increase in 'zoombombing'. (Stock image)</p>

<p>'We have apologised to all those who were present at Monday's meeting and have offered the opportunity to speak to a member of our safeguarding team if anyone was distressed by what they saw.</p>

<p>'Many of those present have already signed up to a future date.</p>

<p>'It wasn't very pleasant for any of us who were there, but we're confident that we've minimised the risk of it happening again.' </p>

<p>There has been an increase in 'zoombombing' since lockdown forced companies to use the video conference app as more employees worked from home.</p>

<p>The hacking method is a type of cyber-harassment in which an individual or a group of unwanted and uninvited users interrupt online meetings.</p>

<p>This disruption occurs when intruders gate-crash gatherings - sometimes for malicious purposes, such as sharing pornographic or hate images or shouting offensive language.</p>

<p>To avoid interruptions, meeting attendees must use a passcode to join a meeting.</p>

<p>An additional protective feature is Waiting Room, where the host must admit attendees. </p>
