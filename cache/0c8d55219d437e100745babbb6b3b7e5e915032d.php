<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Duchess of Cornwall has spoken about 'heartbreaking' stories of domestic abuse as cases soar during lockdown.</p>

<p>Writing in the Guardian, Camilla said that lockdown had brought out the 'best and worst of human behaviour'.</p>

<p>She said while many families and neighbours have pulled together to support each other, there has also been a sharp rise in reports to domestic violence support services.</p>

<p>Camilla has urged concerned family members to 'reach in' to suspected victims of domestic abuse as she shares 'heartbreaking' stories from those suffering abuse during lockdown</p>

<p>In April this year, the domestic abuse charity SafeLives launched its #ReachIn campaign, encouraging people to act if they're concerned someone they know is experiencing domestic abuse during lockdown.</p>

<p>In what Camilla called 'deeply troubling' statistics, cases of domestic abuse have risen by 20 per cent globally.</p>

<p>In the UK, a quarter of services are concerned about an increase in referrals as lock-down lifts while more than a third of services said they had already seen an increase in demand for their services </p>

<p>Camilla said that, as a patron of SafeLives, she has been reading 'heartbreaking' responses to a survey they have carried out.</p>

<p>One woman wrote: 'His emotional and verbal abuse is escalating the longer we're isolated, and I'm concerned that mentally I won't survive this.'</p>

<p>While another added: 'Every so often he gets on his high horse and pushes me or spits in my face and he shouts and scares us.' </p>

<p>The Duchess urged anyone who is concerned for someone they know to offer help, adding: 'In these situations a simple inquiry can be incredibly powerful.'</p>

<p>She pointed to the campaign launched by UK Says No More which has established a network of safe spaces in shops including Boots, Superdrug and Morrisons pharmacies.</p>

<p>Here, you can request to use the private consultation room where all the appropriate service information and access to support will be available.</p>

<p>Calling domestic abuse a 'pernicious disease', the Duchess urged communities to be vigilant even as life begins to turn back to normal.</p>

<p>Domestic abuse charity SafeLives says more than a third of support services have reported an increase in demand since lockdown began as it urges communities to be vigilant to signs</p>

<p>She added: 'We must also remember there are those for whom the lockdown of fear and abuse remains. </p>

<p>'It is therefore vital that we continue to do everything we can to help them in whatever way possible for as long as is necessary.'</p>

<p>SafeLives says that while calls to the national domestic abuse helpline soared by 66% during the lockdown period, the impact of the increase in abuse of adult and child victims of abuse will last years. </p>

<p>SafeLives Pioneer Celia Peachey said: ‘Now more than ever we must stay connected, be sensitive and care for those around us.</p>

<p>'People close by may be suffering in silence, domestic abuse may be happening on a subtle or extreme level, none of it is acceptable-abuse is abuse and it must stop.</p>

<p>‘When people have reached in to me it has given me back my faith and strength to act on the life affirming changes I needed to make, and to thrive on the other side.</p>

<p>‘This pandemic has proved how interdependent we are, picking up on someone’s energy and state of mind is our humanity calling.</p>

<p>'You’re reaching in could save a life. Be brave, Reach in.’</p>
