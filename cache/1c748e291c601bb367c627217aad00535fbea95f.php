<p>Taking to the comments section, one royal fan penned: 'Perhaps change the name to nanna Sarah for today.....lovely news' (pictured)</p>

<p>The children's book was written by Casey especially for her children and niece - and was inspired by her mother who passed away years before becoming a Nanna. </p>

<p>'It's very good - are you ready for all those Nannas, out there? Grannies, Grandmpas, Nannas and everybody out there - it's dead exciting!' Fergie can be heard saying, as she prepares to start reading.</p>

<p>And royal fans were delighted with the 'appropriate' choice of tale about a grandmother - with one even suggesting the Duchess of York should change the name to 'Sarah' for the day - in celebration of her daughter's happy news. </p>

<p>'Congratulations appropriate book to be reading,' enthused one, while a second commented: 'Perhaps change the name to nanna Sarah for today.....lovely news.' </p>

<p>Pitter patter of tiny feet! Eugenie, 30, shared the news on Instagram with a sweet photo of baby slippers and the caption: 'Jack and I are so excited for early 2021</p>

<p>A third added: 'Congratulations! Just think of all the special times you'll have reading to your new grandchild!'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the author of the book commented: 'Thanks so much for sharing my book and congratulations to you.' </p>

<p>Buckingham Palace released a statement this morning that read: 'Her Royal Highness Princess Eugenie and Mr Jack Brooksbank are very pleased to announce that they are expecting a baby in early 2021.</p>

<p>'The Duke of York and Sarah, Duchess of York, Mr and Mrs George Brooksbank, The Queen and The Duke of Edinburgh are delighted with the news.'</p>

<p>Princess Eugenie shared the news on her Instagram shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>The Royal Family shared their congratulations on social media, echoing the best wishes expressed in the statement and accompanying them with a sweet photo of the couple on their wedding day in October 2018.</p>

<p>Sarah Ferguson added to the well-wishes this afternoon. Speaking to Hello!, she said: 'Soon to be Granny and Granddad are absolutely overjoyed!'</p>
