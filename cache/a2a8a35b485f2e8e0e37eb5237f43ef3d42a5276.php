<p>Man and wife: Emma Stone and her fiance Dave McCary are reportedly now man and wife. The 21-year-old actress and the 35-year-old Saturday Night Live segment director wed recently, according to a Wednesday report from PageSix</p>

<p>They announced their engagement last December in a sweet social media post, as Stone showed off her stunning diamond and pearl ring.</p>

<p>The duo were set to wed in March but had to postpone the ceremony due to COVID-19.</p>

<p>But in May, Stone had swapped out her engagement ring for a simple gold band, leading to speculation that she and McCary had secretly tied the knot.</p>

<p>The couple's sighting two weeks ago offers even more evidence the pair may have privately exchanged vows, as they were both seen with bands on their ring fingers.</p>

<p>Stone was also seen dressed in baggy overalls, as rumors swirl that the Easy A star is pregnant.</p>

<p>Rings on! This comes after the power couple were seen wearing matching wedding bands on their rings fingers earlier this month</p>
