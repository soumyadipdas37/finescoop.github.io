<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Karl Stefanovic has slammed Queensland's strict border ban for preventing Scott Morrison from attending the AFL Grand Final. </p>

<p>The current restrictions will make Mr Morrison the first Australian Prime Minister to miss the legendary sporting event, scheduled on October 24, in decades.  </p>

<p>Stefanovic voiced his opinion about Queensland's harsh coronavirus restrictions to Mr Morrison on Thursday morning.   </p>

<p>'I can't believe the Prime Minister of this country can't go to the AFL Grand Final. It's a travesty,' he told the Today Show. </p>

<p>Karl Stefanovic (pictured) has slammed Queensland's harsh border restrictions that will make Scott Morrison the first Australian Prime Minister to miss an AFL grand final in decades </p>

<p>Mr Morrison said he was 'not about to hold my breath' about attending the first AFL Grand Final hosted by Queensland at The Gabba stadium in Brisbane. </p>

<p>'Well, it’s interesting times, isn’t it? You never know, maybe they will change their mind,' he said.  </p>

<p>The state's border restrictions demand residents from NSW, the ACT and Victoria complete a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine when entering Queensland.  </p>

<p>But Mr Morrison said he was happy to adhere to the same rules imposed on everyday Australians. </p>

<p>'The same rules should apply to me as anyone else. Those rules should be fair, they should be sensible and they should be compassionate,' he explained. </p>

<p>Coronavirus hotspot residents will be unable to enter the state, unless they pay $2800 for a 14 day quarantine, in the lead up to Queensland's October 31 election. </p>

<p>This means all politicians, including the prime minister and opposition leader, will have to comply with the measures if they decide to campaign in Queensland.          </p>

<p>Mr Morrison (pictured) said he was happy to adhere to the same coronavirus rules imposed on everyday Australians but was unlikely to complete a mandatory 14-day quarantine </p>

<p>The AFL Grand Final will be held outside of Victoria for the first time on October 24 at Brisbane's Gabba stadium (an AFL match at The Gabba on Monday pictured) </p>

<p>The Queensland government indicated on Wednesday that border restrictions with the ACT and NSW could be eased at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Mr Morrison has called on the Queensland government to implement a fairer quarantine exemption system.</p>

<p>'We have to deal with the virus, not let the virus destroy the way we live,' he said.    </p>

<p>Compassionate quarantine exemptions have become a potent issue in the run-up to the state election and the LNP have branded Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk as 'heartless'.</p>

<p>Sarah Caisip (in yellow), from Canberra, was granted an exemption to have a private viewing of her father's body in Queensland. She was not allowed to greet her family</p>

<p>Last week Mr Morrison asked Ms Palaszczuk to let a 26-year-old nurse attend her father's funeral but the premier refused and accused him of 'bullying and intimidating' her. </p>

<p>Sarah Caisip, who lives in coronavirus-free Canberra, applied for an exemption last month to visit her sick father Bernard Prendergast in Brisbane - but it took 20 days to get approved and he died of liver cancer two days before her flight. </p>

<p>The young woman was banned from attending her father's funeral and was instead only granted a private viewing of his body.  </p>

<p>Queensland Health Department guidelines say the border will remain shut to NSW, ACT and Victoria unless the states go 28 days without community transmission.</p>

<p>Mark Keans </p>

<p>Mark Keans, from Brisbane, was diagnosed with inoperable brain and lung cancer in late July and the doctors believe he won't make it past Christmas.</p>

<p>Health authorities had initially said only one of Mr Keans' four Sydney-based children - all of whom are under the age of 13 - could cross the border to see him one last time.</p>

<p>Queensland Health did not at first respond to multiple requests for an exemption from the truck driver's family, but later told them they can drive into the state and pay for two weeks quarantine in a Brisbane hotel.</p>

<p>A fundraising page to pay for their quarantine has raised more than $200,000, including a $1,000 donation from Prime Minister Scott Morrison.</p>

<p>Kimberley Brown </p>

<p>Kimberley Brown and her husband Scott, from Ballina, in northern New South Wales, were told on August 12 that their unborn twins had developed twin to twin transfusion syndrome.</p>

<p>Mrs Brown needed urgent surgery but despite living just two hours away from Queensland's Mater Hospital doctors told her she would need to apply for a border exemption, which took too long.</p>

<p>She was flown 750km to Sydney but lost one of her twins. </p>

<p>It came ten days after Premier Palaszczuk declared that Queensland hospitals are 'for our people'. </p>

<p>Kimberley Brown and her husband Scott, from Ballina, in northern NSW, learned that they had lost their unborn baby after being forced to travel 750kms because of Queensland's border restrictions  </p>

<p>Jayne Brown</p>

<p>Jayne Brown, 60, spent two weeks confined to a tiny hotel room in Brisbane following her recent return from Sydney, where renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo removed two large tumours on her brain. </p>

<p>The grandmother-of-seven requested an exemption from hotel quarantine to self-isolate at home on the Sunshine Coast, but was rejected twice.</p>

<p>She blasted Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who allowed 400 AFL players and officials from coronavirus-riddled Victoria to enter the state and quarantine in a luxury hotel.</p>

<p>Jayne Brown described the decision to allow 400 AFL officials into Queensland as mindblowing</p>

<p>Sarah Caisip</p>

<p>Sarah Caisip, who lives in coronavirus-free Canberra, applied for an exemption last month to visit her sick father Bernard Prendergast in Brisbane - but it took 20 days to get approved and he died of liver cancer two days before her flight. </p>

<p>The young nurse was banned from attending her father's funeral on Thursday because officials believed she is a Covid-19 risk even though the ACT has had no cases for 60 days. </p>

<p>Ms Caisip was only granted a private viewing of her father's body, surrounded by guards and forbidden from seeing her shattered mother and 11-year-old sister. </p>
