<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A Queensland snake catcher has issued a warning to the public after capturing a huge red belly after it slithered through a school.</p>

<p>Stuart McKenzie from Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers said his last few weeks have been 'ridiculous' after catching several enormous reptiles in snake breeding season.</p>

<p>The experienced catcher told Daily Mail Australia he had seen a number of large adult snakes on the move through the region.</p>

<p>'It's been hectic,' Mr McKenzie said. 'It's that time of year. All the big adult snakes are out and about and mating and all the boys are fighting each other.'</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie was called to relocate an enormous red belly black snake on Friday after it snuck its way through the playground to the back of a school. </p>

<p>Stuart McKenzie (pictured) caught this huge red belly black snake from the back of a school on the Sunshine Coast on Friday</p>

<p>'It was very big for a red belly,' he said. 'A good four-and-a-half to five foot and fat and chunky.</p>

<p>'The teachers did a great job of keeping the kids away.'</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie estimated the snake was around eight-years-old and among a wealth of elder snakes travelling about on the Sunshine Coast lately.</p>

<p>'Everyone's coming out to play,' he said.</p>

<p>He posted a video on his Facebook page on Monday after discovering a whopping carpet python underneath a garbage bin in Nambour.</p>

<p>'The snakes just keep getting bigger,' Mr McKenzie captioned the video. </p>

<p>Mr McKenzie and his team also relocated an enormous carpet python (pictured) underneath a garbage bin in Nambour</p>

<p>'It is pretty crazy how this big snake somehow fit under the small wheelie bin. This is one of the biggest carpet pythons I've caught in years!'</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie warned Queenslanders to keep an eye out for any more big snakes during breeding season.</p>

<p>'If you find a snake, first thing you should do is get all people, kids and pets away from the snake,' he said.</p>

<p>'If you want to relocate it, keep an eye on it from a safe distance and give your local snake catcher a call.'</p>

<p>Mr McKenzie issued a warning to Queenslanders as many large adult snakes are on the move</p>
