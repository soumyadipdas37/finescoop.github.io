<p>Ready to party: Lottie is a regular on the party scene and is often seen out painting the town red on a daily basis</p>

<p>Lottie and Hana - who are both signed with Storm Model Management - have been firm friends for months and are often seen out partying together. </p>

<p>The couple became friends last year when Hana was dating David and Victoria Beckham's son, Brooklyn - so it caused shockwaves when it emerged Lottie had a fling with the photographer prior. </p>

<p>News of their alleged fling came to light in November, with a source telling The Sun on Sunday that David and Victoria were 'less than impressed' after finding out.    </p>

<p>Delightful duo: Lottie was joined by a male friend on the outing with the pair strolling together</p>

<p>Loving life: The duo seemed in high spirits as they chatted away together and giggled </p>

<p>Brooklyn and Lottie have been pals for a number of years and it is claimed that she made it clear their liaison wasn't a serious thing. </p>

<p>The alleged fling was said to be 'embarrassing' for the Beckham family, as both Brooklyn and his parents have socialised with Lottie's supermodel sister Kate in the past.</p>

<p>After connecting with Brooklyn, the model is said to have become pals with now ex-girlfriend Hana, who split with the photographer over the summer.  </p>

<p>A dream in cream: Sartorially in sync with her friend, Hana also looked sensational in a little white dress, which featured a crochet overlay and thigh-skimming hem</p>

<p>Back in September, reports surfaced Victoria and David were relieved when Brooklyn and Hana split in August after nine months together.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun at the time: 'Brooklyn and Hana have called off their romance for good. David and Victoria very glad and relieved and are backing him 100 per cent.' </p>

<p>Hana has since moved on from her turbulent romance with Brooklyn and is dating Nasser Alfallah, who is a Loyola Marymount University student in Los Angeles and is originally from Kuwait. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Lottie has been linked to I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! star Roman Kemp, with the pair reportedly enjoying a kiss after a 'fun, tipsy date'. </p>

<p>As for Brooklyn, he announced his engagement to actress and heiress Nicola Peltz in July but has sparked rumours that the pair have already wed in secret. </p>

<p>The duo also sparked pregnancy rumours when Nicola referred to a 'baby' in a cryptic post.  </p>
