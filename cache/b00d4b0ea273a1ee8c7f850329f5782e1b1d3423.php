<p>The three of us! Maren Morris shared a rare family portrait on Wednesday with her husband Ryan Hurd and son Hayes Andrew as the child turned six months old</p>

<p>Morris added, 'He eats all the green foods I would never touch, and I think we’ve only heard him really cry 4 different times. </p>

<p>'We are honestly just waiting for the spell to wear off and he becomes a terror, but so far, he’s just been our sweet, sensitive son. Happy half year, Bub.'</p>

<p>The star wore her hair down and had on a black shirt as she cradled her child who was in a onesie. Her husband was behind them. </p>

<p>Happy mommy: '6 months ago today, our boy was born. He smiled early and stared at you intently like he had known you in a past life,' began the country singer in her caption</p>

<p>This comes after the star said last week she's through the worst of her battle with postpartum depression, five months after giving birth to her son Hayes Andrew.</p>

<p>'I'm kind of coming through the tunnel now, I feel back to normal,' the Middle singer, 30, told CBS This Morning on a remote stream from her Nashville home.</p>

<p>The Grammy-winning artist, who welcomed son Hayes Andrew March 23, said that she received mental health services amid the difficult time, which coincided with the early days of the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.</p>

<p>Back on the red carpet: On September 16 the siren posed with her Female Artist of the Year award at the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards at the Grand Ole Opry</p>

<p>'Fortunately, I was able to do phone therapy during the pandemic,' the country music artist said, adding that she was surrounded by 'people that love [her] around [her] that are like, "Hey, if you're drowning right now, there's help."'</p>

<p>The My Church artist explained the turmoil she experienced at the time, saying, 'You're trying to become a new mother and good parent and do everything right and you just feel like you suck at every level.</p>

<p>'And then the one thing I've always felt like I have a handle on is my music. And to not be able to tour and have to furlough my band and crew, it was just a lot.'</p>

<p>Morris underwent 30 hours of labor and doctors had to perform a cesarean section in welcoming the child.</p>

<p>Self-care: Morris was flanked by a strong support system amid the difficult time, which coincided with the early days of the coronavirus pandemic shutdown</p>

<p>She told Is This Normal from Little Spoon in support of the Black Women’s Health Imperative nonprofit that she had hopes to have a natural childbirth but complications led doctors to deliver the baby via C-section.</p>

<p>'I stopped having contractions and it was just time to call it and get him out safely, so I just wish I had done a better job at preparing myself for the shock of a c-section, because the postpartum of a c-section is so brutal.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I wish people talked more about their c-section stories because I felt, like a lot of mothers, really isolated, really lonely, right after because it was this unexpected major surgery I ended up getting.'  </p>

<p>In July the star hit back at an Instagram user who shamed her for wearing a cleavage-baring dress in a selfie that showed off her new hairstyle.</p>

<p>Maren posed for two snaps showing off her wavy locks while wearing a sexy aqua blue low-cut dress.</p>

<p>Girl bye: Morris hit back after she was criticized for posting this snap of her showing off her wavy hair in July</p>

<p>Proudly showing off the look, the 30-year-old captioned the image 'wavy hair' and tagged her hairstylist. </p>

<p>Many of Maren's fans praised her for the glam look but there was one negative comment left under the photo which the songstress couldn't help but respond to. </p>

<p>'Wavy hair as the camera is only on your tits . Yes it’s distasteful for sure . Come on if your caption reads wavy hair maybe keep the focus on the hair , or perhaps make the caption big boobs ? Just saying like holy cow . Everything in this world doesn’t make sense anymore , clearly these littles don’t have much to look up to either.' a user named <?php echo e('@'); ?>richellechapman wrote.</p>

<p>Fans did not approve of this: Maren was shamed before that as well for posing on a pool float with her three-month-old son Hayes on her lap and a can of beer in her hand. The star replied with: 'Honestly, I get so many criticisms of my motherhood on anything I post of Hayes, so I may just discontinue posting photos of him'</p>

<p>The Texas born beauty wasted no time in clapping back at the Instagram user, as she replied 'girl BYE. Don’t let my boobs knock you on the way out.'</p>

<p>One Twitter user said: 'It is common sense for a baby to be wearing a life jacket. You never know what could happen. When something does happen you have no one but yourself to blame.' </p>

<p>She deleted all photos of her son from social media after that. </p>

<p>'Honestly, I get so many criticisms of my motherhood on anything I post of Hayes, so I may just discontinue posting photos of him. Sucks but it’s kind of where I’m at,' she wrote on Twitter.   </p>
