<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lyon manager Rudi Garcia has said he won't stand in Memphis Depay's way if Barcelona come calling for the Dutch forward.</p>

<p>Ronald Koeman is believed to be very keen in signing the 26-year-old who he knows well from his time as the Dutch national manager. </p>

<p>The new Barcelona coach believes Depay would be a suitable replacement for Luis Suarez and the club believe they can sign him for just £17m, as there is only one year left on his current deal. </p>

<p>Memphis Depay has been linked with a reunion with Ronald Koeman at Barcelona this summer</p>

<p>Koeman is believed to see Depay as a fitting replacement for current front-man Luis Suarez</p>

<p>Garcia has acknowledged the rumours and has opened the door to his possible departure.</p>

<p>He told Telefoot: 'I read the Catalan press this morning. They talk about Memphis, but they also say that Luis Suarez is not gone.</p>

<p>'There was also a small left-footed player (Lionel Messi) who wanted to leave but who ultimately stayed - so there may not be room to take another player.</p>

<p>'Memphis is a fantastic player and if he can make the season with Lyon, we will only be stronger.</p>

<p>'But like many of my players, if they have the opportunity to play in a club built to win the Champions League, and he's met a lot of them last season, I will personally take him in my car.'  </p>

<p>The 26-year-old has impressed during his time at Lyon where he has scored 57 goals in 139 appearances, helping the club to the Champions League semi-finals last season after beating Juventus and Manchester City.  </p>

<p>Lyon coach Rudi Garcia has said he won't stand in Depay's way if Barcelona come calling </p>

<p>Depay has started the 2020-21 season brightly with Lyon, as he scored a hat-trick in his side's 4-1 win over Dijon last weekend to get their Ligue 1 campaign off to the perfect start.</p>

<p>The Dutch forward played a crucial part in Koeman's time as Holland manager, which ended with his arrival at the Nou Camp. </p>

<p>Barcelona have also been linked with the capture of Depay's international team-mate Georginio Wijnaldum, with the Liverpool man also having just one-year left on his current deal. </p>

<p>Depay would be seen as a replacement for Suarez, who has been linked with a move to Juventus. </p>
