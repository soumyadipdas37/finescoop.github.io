<p>Lady Amelia completed the look by styling her blonde hair in beach waves, with minimal make-up underneath a white face mask amid the ongoing pandemic.</p>

<p>Paris is set to impose strict new regulations in attempt to slow the spike in coronavirus cases. </p>

<p>Despite the crisis, the royal appeared in good spirits as she stopped to pose for photographs outside the prestigious venue.</p>

<p>The Place Vendom, designed by architect Peter Marino, is a place of significance for the brand because it marks the place where a young Louis Vuitton opened his first store over 160 years ago. </p>

<p>The location is a hub for the brand's clothes, leather goods, fragrances, shoes and jewellery.    </p>

<p>The 24-year-old (pictured) accessorized with an oversize silver ring and matching drop earrings for effortless elegance</p>

<p>Better safe than sorry: The petite royal, 25, wore a white face mask, which offset her black heeled loafers</p>

<p>Monochrome proved to be a popular choice for stars in attendance at the hotly anticipated event with Swedish actress Alicia Vikander, opting for a white ruffled blouse and black mini skirt, with the addition of a handbag by Louis Vuitton.</p>

<p>She also put style and safety in the forefront as she teamed her number with a protective face mask while entering the event. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, French fashion model Cindy Bruna demonstrated effortless style in head-to-toe black with clashing textures. </p>

<p>She framed her face with bouncy curls swept to one side and dazzling drop earrings.</p>

<p>Blogger Camille Charria was also on trend in a black and white dress, teamed with a sparkly silver Louis Vuitton handbag .</p>

<p>Paris Fashion Week, which is set to host presentations by Kenzo, Kenneth Ize and Schiaparelli, will end on October 6. </p>

<p>Emmanuel Macron's government has ordered bars in Paris, along with Lyon and nine other cities on 'heightened alert', to close at 10pm.</p>

<p>There is also a 10-person restriction at public gatherings with attendees at weddings and parties limited to 30. </p>

<p>Gyms and other indoor sporting facilities will also remain closed and it remains mandatory for all pedestrians to wear face masks in public areas in the capital. </p>

<p>The move comes as the president tries to avoid imposing a full lockdown across the country with the French economy already set to shrink by 8.7 per cent this year.</p>

<p>Quirky: Fashion writer Camille Charriere displayed her lean legs in a two-toned dress with balloon-inspired shoulder pads</p>
