<p>Steamy! Fans of The Bachelor Australia are bracing for some of the 'raunchiest' dates the franchise has ever seen during the upcoming isolation episodes</p>

<p>Filming at the Bachelor mansion was suspended shortly after the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global pandemic.</p>

<p>The dating show continued production via digital means, including Zoom dates, phone chats and virtual hangouts.</p>

<p>The impromptu new concept started well, with the source saying: 'There was a whole lot of raunchy phone chats, let's put it that way. The producers encouraged the girls to be as flirty and open as they could be.'</p>

<p>The women were urged to flirt with Locky, 31, on Zoom and through a series of video diaries they recorded for the former Australian Survivor star.</p>

<p>However, producers reportedly believed that they weren't being racy enough, and so encouraged them to resort to more extreme measures.</p>

<p>'Because the girls were separated from him, the producers were concerned he would lose interest and that the lack of physical connection could see him become disinterested,' the insider said. </p>

<p>They then decided on a new idea: 'bathtub dates'.</p>

<p>It was during these bubbly Zoom chats that things supposedly took a daring turn - much to the satisfaction of producers.</p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7:30pm on Channel 10</p>
