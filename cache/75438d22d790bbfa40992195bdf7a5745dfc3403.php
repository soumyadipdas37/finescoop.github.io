<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sale won the Premiership Rugby Cup by producing a grandstand finish in Salford last night to claim their first trophy for 14 years.</p>

<p>Steve Diamond's men surged into a 10-0 lead early on, only for Harlequins to score 19 unanswered points before the hosts staged a dramatic final-quarter fightback.</p>

<p>Sale struck the decisive blow five minutes from the end as South African fly-half Rob du Preez landed a penalty. Three minutes later he converted a solo try from Faf de Klerk (right).</p>

<p>Marland Yarde (second from right) and Sale Sharks staged a late comeback against Harlequins</p>

<p>The rollercoaster late finish handed Sale a thrilling Premiership Rugby Cup triumph in Salford</p>

<p>The Cheshire club's last title was back in 2004 when they won the Premiership by thrashing Leicester in the final. This success will provide a confidence boost as they seek to revive their play-off prospects and strive for a league and cup double.</p>

<p>In an attritional first half, Sale went ahead through hooker Curtis Langdon's close-range try. Rob du Preez converted and added a penalty but Quins rallied impressively.</p>

<p>Marcus Smith was on target with two penalties to reduce the deficit to four points, then Paul Gustard's side claimed a try eight minutes before the break as James Chisholm barged over. Smith's extras and a penalty put his side 16-10 up at the break.</p>

<p>Sale's family affair played an important part as they recovered from being 10-0 and 16-10 down</p>

<p>The Londoners' No 10 was on target with the boot again in the 50th minute to extend his side's lead, but Sale deployed their powerful replacements and turned the tide.Â </p>

<p>From a line out 13 minutes from time, the Sharks pack drove hard at the line and Dan du Preez scored a try converted by brother Rob. He was on the mark again in the closing minutes as Sale completed their dramatic comeback.</p>

<p>Saracens are destined to go into their Heineken European Champions Cup semi-final against Racing 92 in Paris on Saturday without another key player, after Michael Rhodes was cited for butting Leinster centre Robbie Henshaw.</p>

<p>The South African flanker has a hearing today and faces a minimum six-week ban if found guilty.</p>

<p>Saracens are already without suspended England captain Owen Farrell, while a host of their stars are out on loan.</p>
