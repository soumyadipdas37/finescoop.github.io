<p>'She's frickin amazing!' an excited Locky gushes in a piece to camera describing the mystery blonde</p>

<p>Last month, Daily Mail Australia published images of Bec attending a rose ceremony following hometown week, which was filmed in July. </p>

<p>Five women were pictured on the grounds of the estate: Irena Srbinovska, Kaitlyn Hoppe, Bella Varelis, Izzy Sharman-Firth and Bec, who hasn't debuted on the show yet.</p>

<p>Bella and Irena's place in the top five isn't surprising, as they've both been tipped as favourites for weeks. </p>

<p>Star on the rise? Last month, Daily Mail Australia published images from July 7, that showed Bec at the last rose ceremony before hometown week</p>

<p>Is that you, Bec? Footage first released more than three weeks ago showed the blonde enjoying a single date with Locky white water rafting </p>

<p>Bec lives in Sydney, but hails from Queensland's Sunshine Coast. </p>

<p>She has had a YouTube channel since 2013, and while it is void of content at the moment, it features a recent display photo.</p>

<p>While Bec joins the cast in an upcoming episode, she's already sneakily featured in promotional footage for the series.</p>

<p>The blonde appears to enjoy a single date with Locky whitewater rafting, and even shares a kiss with the former Survivor star while aboard the adventure raft.  </p>

<p>Oops: Intruder bride Kaitlyn Hoppe, 26, (pictured) was featured, and named, in the extended first look trailer for The Bachelor three weeks before her official cast announcement</p>
