<p>The ponies died at the monarch's Balmoral estate in Scotland, where they were part of a programme designed to preserve the historic breed.</p>

<p>Stud manager Sylvia Ormiston said five ponies on the estate – including two breeding stallions – had died from equine grass sickness in just two years. The disease is believed to be triggered by toxins which attack the nervous system and eventually paralyse the animal's gut.</p>

<p>Mrs Ormiston, 55, who has run the Balmoral stud since 2007, said she hoped further research could help to tackle the 'dreadful disease' following the deaths.</p>

<p>The hardy Highland ponies are used as workhorses at Balmoral, where much of the massive estate is inaccessible by vehicle.</p>

<p>During stag hunting season they carry the carcasses, which can weigh up to 18 stone.</p>

<p>They also carry picnics for the Royal Family and their guests at grouse shoots, and bring back the shot birds in large pannier baskets.</p>

<p>In an interview with the British Horse Society's magazine, Mrs Ormiston described the impact of the disease on the Balmoral stud.</p>

<p>She said it first took Friendly, 'a sweet two-year-old filly', followed by her mother, Clunie, 24 hours later. Later that year a three-year-old male called Omar also died – and in 2018 the stud's two stallions, Balmoral Lord and Balmoral Hercules, died within two weeks of each other.</p>

<p>Samples of stud champion Balmoral Lord's DNA had been stored in Britain's first livestock gene bank prior to his death, as the breed is at risk.</p>

<p>The death of the two stallions posed a serious threat to the breeding programme at Balmoral, in which the Queen has taken a personal interest. The 94-year-old approves the names given to each pony bred on the estate – and when she is in residence, some of the animals are led near the castle so she can see them from her window.</p>

<p>Mrs Ormiston added: 'Here at Balmoral we are prepared to help in any way we can to make progress towards a cure for this dreadful disease.'</p>

<p>Highland ponies are native to Scotland but are now considered vulnerable by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. The Queen rode the breed as a teenager, and is now patron of the Highland Pony Society.</p>

<p>The monarch also breeds Fell ponies, another variety native to the UK that is also classed as vulnerable.</p>
