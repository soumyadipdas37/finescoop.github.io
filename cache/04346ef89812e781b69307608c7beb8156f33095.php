<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will sign a new deal worth an initial £250,000-per-week in a major boost to Arsenal for the new season.</p>

<p>Captain Aubameyang, 31, is poised to commit his future to the club after finalising an improved contract that will run until 2023.</p>

<p>The Gabon striker, whose first Arsenal deal was worth £200,000-per-week, will receive a hike in his basic wage in the fresh contract. </p>

<p>Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is set to sign a new contract with Arsenal worth £250,000 a week</p>

<p>Further bonuses could make the new agreement worth in excess of £300,000-a-week and potentially take his earnings beyond current top earner, £350,000-per-week Mesut Ozil.</p>

<p>Aubameyang has scored 71 goals in 110 appearances for Arsenal and the contract he signed when he joined for £56m from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018 was due to expire next summer.</p>

<p>Aubameyang's new three-year deal at Arsenal is set to be worth an initial £250,000-per-week</p>

<p>The 31-year-old's new contract is set to be a major boost to Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta</p>

<p>His new deal was verbally agreed last month and Arsenal are now on the verge of officially confirming he has extended his stay.</p>

<p>Aubameyang played a crucial part in Arsenal's FA Cup success last season, scoring a brace in the semi-final win against Manchester City before repeating the feat against Chelsea in the final.</p>

<p>He has mainly been used out wide by Mikel Arteta and will hope to hit the ground running when Arsenal start the new Premier League campaign away to Fulham on Saturday. </p>
