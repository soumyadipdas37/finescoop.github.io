<p>Pretty in pink: The daughter he shares with supermodel ex Irina Shayk went with a pink color theme for her adorable outfit, as she rode on her 6ft1in dad's shoulders</p>

<p>Cooper revealed how he has been spending quarantine with his mother Gloria Campano and daughter Lea while speaking with Interview Magazine.</p>

<p> Bradley also said he had been 'running a one-man preschool' for Lea, whom he has been teaching how to swim in their bathtub.</p>

<p>'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house. My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over,' he said.</p>

<p>'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.'</p>

<p>Bradley and Irina split last year after four years together. </p>

<p>Worlds apart: Just days ago Bradley was seen strutting around Encino, California, soaked in fake blood for his part in Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film</p>

<p>Under wraps: Little is known about filmmaker Anderson's latest project except that it is set in LA's San Fernando Valley in the 1970s and centers on a high school student who is also a child actor</p>
