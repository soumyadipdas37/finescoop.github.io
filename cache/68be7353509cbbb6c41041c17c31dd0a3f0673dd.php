<p>Stunning! Clara Amfo has reflected on her powerful anti-racism speech in the October issue of Cosmopolitan</p>

<p>In June, the broadcaster broke down in tears on her radio show as she discussed her mental health struggles following the death of George Floyd.  </p>

<p>Clara delivered a powerful speech on racism as she told listeners she was unable to come into work the day before and speak with 'happy intention' when she had spent the weekend devastated.</p>

<p>Discussing her powerful speech with Cosmopolitan, she said: 'It was a culmination of all those weeks. [The death of] Ahmaud Arbery, then Breonna Taylor, and then, obviously, George Floyd, the list goes on. </p>

<p>'And years before that, Philando Castile, Sandra Bland... You just carry it. You carry it with you and it just comes to that point where I was like, "You know what? I've just got to come with the realness." That's why I said what I said.'</p>

<p>Keeping it real! The BBC Radio 1 presenter, 36, also admitted that she is 'very aware' of the new attention on her but insisted that she is still 'quite a low-key person'</p>

<p>She added: 'I knew I wanted to speak about [George Floyd] because, at that point, I'd just had enough of not sharing that side of who I am.'</p>

<p>Clara also thanked her listeners, she continued: 'If I was going through anything else – God forbid, if I had an illness or if I was going through a painful break- up – honestly, I'd tell my listeners because they're cool like that.' </p>

<p>The star admitted that although she is grateful for people's support she doesn't want her professional legacy to be 'that girl who cried on the radio'.</p>

<p>She said: 'That day definitely made me feel my purpose in my job, more than anything I've done, but I don't want my professional legacy to be "That girl who cried on the radio".'</p>

<p>Clara added: 'I'm so much more than that; we're all so much more than these moments. </p>

<p>Emotional: In June, the broadcaster broke down in tears on her radio show as she discussed her mental health struggles following the death of George Floyd</p>

<p>'It's not that I'm not grateful for what people are saying, but I think, for my own brain space, I know what I said in that moment and now those words are out there, they've travelled to people. </p>

<p>'Now I want the truth of those words, for the people who felt affected by them, to pay it forward, to do the work.'</p>

<p>Talking about the work and steps that need to happen next, Clara admitted that she has been reflecting on her own privileges.</p>

<p>She said: 'I've had to reflect on myself and my own privileges. Because within Black Lives Matter, there's Black Trans Lives Matter. I've had to look at myself as a straight person. </p>

<p>'I've had to look at [myself] in the very same way that I've been asking white people to look at themselves. It's important for all of us to take accountability for how we move through the world.'</p>

<p>Talking about the new attention she has received recently, Clara insisted that she is still 'quite a low-key person'.  </p>

<p>She said: 'I feel like I'm in this new phase of my career where I'm very aware of the new attention that's on me. But I'm still quite a low-key person. I don't view myself as acting particularly like a celebrity. </p>

<p>'I understand it's a public- facing job – I appear on television and I do radio – so people are going to recognise me. But I don't live a particularly starry existence.'</p>

<p>And it looks as though Clara could be getting even more attention as she is rumoured to be a contestant on the new series of Strictly. </p>

<p>Discussing the speculation, she teased: 'Look, Strictly is an amazing show. </p>

<p>'It's so sweet-spirited; nobody ever watches it with a bad intention and that's what I've always loved about it… I went to watch it [live] last season! The magic of it is so overwhelming.'</p>

<p>Talking about her future, she said: 'I know that this is exactly where I'm supposed to be. My work, where I am now, I feel ready for it. I'm aware of who I want to fight for and what I want to lend my voice to. I feel supercharged, I feel ready.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in her personal life, Clara teased that she is 'entertaining conversations' of dating. </p>

<p>She said: 'I'm really open about dating because I know so many women in a similar position to me where they're really coming to know what they're worth. Some of the sh*t that I put up with in my late teens and early twenties, it wouldn't ever fly now!'</p>

<p>Clara looked sensational for the October issue of Cosmopolitan and on the cover she wore a stylish orange patterned shorts and blazer combo.</p>

<p>While a different look saw the broadcaster in a fabulous multicoloured chequered trouser suit.  </p>
