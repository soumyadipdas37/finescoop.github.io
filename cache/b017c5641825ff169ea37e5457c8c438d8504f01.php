<p>'Strongher together': Former Married At First Sight star Tracey Jewel has been trolled over a perceived spelling mistake in an Instagram photo</p>

<p>While the spelling of 'stronger' as 'strongher' was intentional, Tracey was immediately trolled for the post, with many of her followers assuming that she'd made a mistake.</p>

<p>'Excuse me i noticed you misspelled "Stronger",' commented one concerned fan.</p>

<p>'Pls fix the spelling it’s all I’m able to look at,' snapped another, while one laughed, 'Someone can't spell lol.'</p>

<p>'It was spelt StrongHer (strong her) on purpose for women’s mental health!' While the spelling was intentional, Tracey was immediately trolled for the post, with many of her followers assuming that she'd made a mistake</p>

<p>Another follower wrote sarcastically: 'That's all I noticed too... The spelling! Someone's very well "edumicated".' </p>

<p>Tracey was eventually forced to step in and explain that her spelling 'mistake' was actually intentional.</p>

<p>'It was spelt StrongHer (strong her) on purpose for women’s mental health for liptember x but thanks for the concern and messages everyone,' she wrote.</p>

<p>Many of the former reality star's fans then came to her defence.</p>

<p>'Fine example of how people’s minds work. People that were quick to point out the spelling mistake are negative. Their first reaction was to pinpoint the negative rather than read the positive message regardless,' one wrote.</p>

<p>Another commented: 'Most look for faults and negative points. Build each other up ladies then we can definitely be stronger.'</p>
