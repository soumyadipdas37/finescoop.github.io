<p>But on Friday, the former Home and Away actress, 36, had to bid Patrick goodbye as he flew back to the US on a private jet. </p>

<p>Pia and Patrick, 55, were spotted shopping at Woolworths in Double Bay, one of the richest suburb in Sydney, on Friday morning. </p>

<p>She cut a summery look in a flowy green dress from Auguste The Label, which featured a thigh-high split.</p>

<p>The wrap-around frock loosely skimmed the beauty's figure, with a V-neck cut showing off a hint of her cleavage. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Patrick wore Nike Jordans, black jeans and a grey shirt with a 'Loyola Football' graphic emblazoned across the chest. </p>

<p> Time to say goodbye: After their trip to Woolworths, the couple headed to a Sydney private jet base where a Gulfstream jet was waiting for Patrick</p>

<p>Prepare for takeoff! The smitten couple then said there goodbyes before the multi-millionaire (pictured) boarded the flight to fly back to the US</p>

<p>Loyola is actually Pia's surname, although she is commonly known as Miller, which she adopted from her AFL ex Brad Miller, with whom she split from in 2015. </p>
