<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A new excerpt from an upcoming book about the epic saga of bringing Game of Thrones to live on the small screen reveals new details about the original pilot.</p>

<p>What some might not know is the show's original pilot, which cost $10 million to produce, never aired, with HBO agreeing to let creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss to re-shoot the pilot and re-cast key roles.</p>

<p>Game of Thrones author George R.R. Martin revealed in the book Fire Cannot Kill the Dragon, written by Entertainment Weekly's James Hibberd, that Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson) was almost written off the show entirely.</p>

<p>No Rickon: Author George R.R. Martin revealed in the book, written by Entertainment Weekly 's James Hibberd, that Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson) was almost written off the show entirely</p>

<p>'The biggest thing was Dan and David called me up and had the idea of eliminating Rickon, the youngest of the Stark children, because he didn’t do much in the first book. I said I had important plans for him, so they kept him,' Martin said.</p>

<p>Rickon was only featured in 14 of the show's 73 episodes, but his arc proved to be quite important towards the end of the show.</p>

<p>At the end of Season 3, Rickon was sent to House Umber, a family loyal to the Stark's, as a last resort, so he can stay safe in case the rest of the Stark family dies.</p>

<p>Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) had claimed to have killed both Bran and Rickon to the new Warden of the North, Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), though he ultimately found out that Bran and Rickon were still alive.</p>

<p>After not appearing in the fourth and fifth seasons, Rickon made his return in Season 6, though it was short-lived, killed in a brutal fashion by Ramsay.</p>

<p>His death would ultimately spark what would become known as the Battle of the Bastards between Ramsay and Jon Snow (Kit Harrington), which Snow ultimately won, resuming control of Winterfell to House Stark. </p>

<p>The original pilot was directed by Tom McCarthy (Spotlight) and featured actors like Tamzin Merchant as Daenerys Targaryen, who was replaced by Emilia Clarke and Jennifer Ehle as Catelyn Stark, who was replaced by Michelle Fairley.</p>

<p>Martin also revealed that the after-wedding scene between Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa) and Daenerys Targaryen where they 'consummate' the relationship was a rape in the pilot that made it to air, but it wasn't rape in Martin's book, nor was it rape in the original pilot.</p>

<p>'Dany and Drogo don’t have the same language. Dany is a little scared but also a little excited, and Drogo is being more considerate. The only words he knows are “yes” or “no.” Originally it was a fairly faithful version,' Martin said.</p>

<p>He also shared a humorous story from the original pilot during the sex scene between Momoa and Merchant, involving a horse on set.</p>

<p>'So we’re by this little brook. They tied the horses to the trees and there’s a seduction scene by the stream. Jason Momoa and Tamzin are naked and “having sex.” And suddenly the video guy starts to laugh,' Martin said. </p>

<p>'The silver filly was not a filly at all. It was a colt. And it was getting visibly excited by watching these two humans. There’s this horse in the background with this enormous horse schlong. So that didn’t go well either,' Martin added.</p>

<p>The book Fire Cannot Kill the Dragon will be published on October 6. </p>
