<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Daisy Kalnina, 33, founded salon gel polish brand The GelBottle Inc in 2017. </p>

<p>Last year, it became the first official nail supplier to London Fashion Week and Kalnina launched its sister brand, Peacci. </p>

<p>She lives in Brighton with her husband and three children.</p>

<p>I wanted to become a professional painter. Unfortunately it's an uncertain path, and I come from a modest background.</p>

<p>Age 15, I helped manage my mother's beauty salon. Later, I studied business and IT and started a double glazing company. But then the recession hit, and I had to close the business.</p>

<p>Daisy Kalnina, 33, founded salon gel polish brand The GelBottle Inc in 2017</p>

<p>By 2012, I was a single mother with three children, so I decided to open a nail salon in my home. I thought, I can take my greatest passion — art — and put it on nails.</p>

<p>It wasn't easy to balance childcare with working from home, so I found a retail space to rent in Brighton for £600 a month.</p>

<p>I used my savings and applied for a government small business start-up grant, but I couldn't find a nail product that gave me the colours, pigments and quality I wanted — even my favourite brand offered only 70 shades. </p>

<p>So I decided to create my own line of professional gel polish, just for my clients.</p>

<p>I did a lot of research and found a supplier who could send me different formulas to test.</p>

<p>Daisy founded her company after being unable to find a nail product that gave her the colours, pigments and quality she wanted — even her favourite brand offered only 70 shades. She then launched sister brand Peacci (pictured)</p>

<p>The GelBottle Inc was born with a range of 300 colours. Our polishes are strong, long-wearing, 100 per cent cruelty-free and vegan.</p>

<p>My customers were obsessed and pushed me to launch the brand nationwide and beyond. </p>

<p>We began supplying nail artists in the U.S. and the Kardashians started using us, as did Jennifer Lopez and Dua Lipa. Then, in 2019, we became the first-ever official nail supplier to London Fashion Week.</p>

<p>During Fashion Week, I noticed that models needed different nail looks multiple times a day. </p>

<p>Long-lasting gel polish just wasn't going to be suitable, so I decided to create a sister brand offering home polish with a superior pigment.</p>

<p>Turnover for the firm was £12million last year and they now have a huge warehouse in Shoreham</p>

<p>Peacci launched in July 2019 with a collection of trend-led shades.</p>

<p>Last year, turnover was £12 million. Today, we have a huge warehouse in Shoreham, West Sussex, where we employ 30 people.</p>

<p>We can cater for any style and any age. For our nude collection, the aim is to launch something in every single skin tone, A to Z.</p>

<p>I never became a painter, but I love that nail art really is a creative form of expression. </p>
