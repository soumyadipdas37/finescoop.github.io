<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Hilary Duff reunited with her ex-husband Mike Comrie on Friday to spend time with their son Luca, aged eight. </p>

<p>The exes appeared to be friendly as they walked around a local park in Los Angeles engaging in some chit-chat and activities, all while they wore protective masks amid the still raging COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Duff and Comrie, who married for more than five years, announced their separation in January 2014. </p>

<p>Making it work: Hilary Duff, 32, took her son Luca to a local park in Los Angeles on Friday for an afternoon outing with her ex-husband Mike Comrie</p>

<p>Duff, 32, arrived at the park with Luca carrying a pair of sneakers in one hand and what appeared to be some sort of drawing/painting board in the other.  </p>

<p>She stood out in the fashion department in a multi-colored, spaghetti-strap dress that included patterns of red, green, blue, yellow, black and white.</p>

<p>Rounding out her ensemble, the Lizzie McGuire star wore a pair of sandals, a large chain-link necklace, and styled her blonde tresses long and with a part in the middle. </p>

<p>Quality time: Duff and Comrie, a former hockey player who played 13-seasons in the NHL, shared time with their son both separately and together</p>

<p>Luca looked cute in black pants with a white t-shirt and sneakers.</p>

<p>His dad, a former professional hockey player who played 13-years in the NHL, enjoyed the family time in black shorts, t-shirt and white sneakers. </p>

<p>Each parent got to spend some one-on-one time with Luca, and at other times all three of them talked while making their way around the park. </p>

<p>By mid-afternoon, Duff took to Instagram to gush about the progress her son is making in school, but with an added disclaimer about how he might be growing up a little too fast for her liking.  </p>

<p>'My guy is getting an expander and starting 3rd grade!!!!!! she wrote in the caption of a photo of mother and son flashing big beaming smiles.</p>

<p>'SOS it's going too fast! Slow down the tape!'   </p>

<p>The former couple began dating in 2007 and were eventually married in August 2010. They ended up splitting in 2014 and then finalized their divorce two-years later.</p>

<p>Duff also has a 22-month-old daughter Banks with her new husband and musician Matthew Koma.</p>
