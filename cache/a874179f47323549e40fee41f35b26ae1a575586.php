<p>The 28-year-old mother has transformed her tiny bedroom into a lush green 'jungle'</p>

<p>'Having all the plants in my bedroom makes it feel more serene, but also more alive,' Shanna told Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'I love just sitting in the little spaces I've created, whether it's on my bed in the sunshine with the trailing plants, or in my little occasional chair surrounded by all my other plants.</p>

<p>'They definitely bring me joy to look at. I'm not sure what it would be like if I didn't have all my plants, very, very bare I would think.'</p>

<p>The young woman - who's behind the popular Instagram page My Bedroom Jungle - said her indoor plant sanctuary has positively impacted every aspect of her life.</p>

<p>'My plants have definitely changed my life,' she explained. </p>

<p>'They give me something to care for, and when I have no motivation the routine for caring for them gives me something to do. They also remind me to care for myself as well.'</p>

<p>The 28-year-old said her bedroom now feels like a jungle with plants ranging from the classic mother-in-law's tongue to the rarer species like the mini monstera and Swiss cheese vine</p>

<p>The plant enthusiast said her collection started organically in her light-filled bedroom just less than two years ago.</p>

<p>'It kinda just happened slowly over the first year of me collecting plants,' she said. </p>

<p>'My parents aren't really fans of indoor plants, so they have all been relegated to my own bedroom. </p>

<p>'It wasn't really until the last half of year or so that I figured out my own style and actually made my bedroom jungle look stylish rather than just a mess of plants.'</p>

<p>Fast forward, Shanna said she last counted she had 110 plants in her 'little room'.</p>

<p>'I could not even begin to estimate the amount I have spent on my plants,' she said, laughing. </p>

<p>'Some have come to me through trades or plant swaps, others through kind friends and a lot I have just bought myself. I think the most I have ever spent on a plant was $80, so not too crazy.'</p>

<p>She has also blended her love for greenery with gaming and Harry Potter.</p>

<p>She said maintaining the plants doesn't take as much work as people may think. 'Since it's winter time, they generally only need watering every couple of weeks, depending on the size of the pot or where they're placed of course,' she said</p>

<p>In all her years collecting, growing and caring for more than 100 plants, Shanna said the biggest lesson she has learnt is 'always check for pests' before buying a potted greenery.</p>

<p>Once you take it home, she suggested quarantining your plant in a separate area for one to two weeks before placing it with your collection.</p>

<p>By quarantining your new houseplant, you minimise the risk of spreading pests and diseases to your other plants.</p>

<p>She said maintaining the plants doesn't take as much work as people may think.</p>

<p>'I generally have a quick check of them all every day, removing dead leaves and checking for pests etc,' she said.</p>

<p>Shanna said the only other plants around the house is in her son's bedroom.</p>

<p>'One day when I have a house of my own, there will be plants in every room. But until then I just have to be satisfied with my little bedroom,' she said, laughing.</p>

<p>In all her years collecting, growing and caring for more than 100 plants, Shanna said the biggest lesson she has learnt is 'always check for pests' before buying a potted greenery.</p>

<p>'Especially when you're buying a new plant. Quarantining a new plant you have bought is always advisable, you don't want to transfer any pests or diseases to the plants you already own,' she said.</p>

<p>'I used to not check for pests or quarantine new plants and have had many a mealy bug outbreak caused by new plants.'</p>

<p>In all her years collecting, growing and caring for more than 100 plants, Shanna said the biggest lesson she has learnt is 'always check for pests' before buying a potted greenery</p>

<p>For first time plant owners, Shanna urged to 'always check for pests' and do your research</p>

<p>For first time plant owners, Shanna has shared her basic tips for starting a collection at home. </p>

<p>'Research the plants you own to figure out what the best care routines for them are. Though I've found there's still a bit of trial and error involved no matter what you do,' she said.</p>

<p>'Invest in a moisture metre. When I first started out I was over watering constantly, which resulted in many plant deaths and almost giving up.</p>

<p>'Choose easy to care for plants, such as pothos [devil's ivy]. Rare plants are generally finicky and expensive. Definitely wait until you have more experience before spending the big money.</p>

<p>'Start with a few easy plants, such as pothos, sansevieria and philodendrons. Join  plant groups on Facebook, either international or in your own area. Most importantly, just have fun with it. Enjoy yourself. And enjoy your plants.'</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Create a focal point: A space that draws the viewer's eye before they see the full scene</p></li>
<li><p>Use different elements along with the plants: Like paintings or posters, décor items and functional items, like clocks and lighting</p></li>
<li><p>Create varying heights: Whether by using tall plants mixed with trailing plants, or incorporating different sized plant stands</p></li>
<li><p>Incorporate hanging plants: Whether from the ceiling or from the underside of your shelves. Macrame hangers add a nice touch</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on your style: You could either use pots of all the same colour scheme such as white, grey and black contrasted with other décor items of differing colours, or switch up the colour and style of the pots themselves</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I would say, it's all up to you. Make your space however it pleases you! There's no point in creating a space that you don't enjoy.</p>
