<p>A concussion is a 'traumatic brain injury (TBI)' that affects the brain function. It can occur after an impact to the head.</p>

<p>According to the Mayo Clinic, the effects of a concussion include 'headaches and problems with concentration, memory, balance and coordination'.</p>

<p>Falls are the most common cause but concussions can also occur if you play a contact sport, such as football or soccer.</p>

<p>Symptoms of a concussion include: Headache, nausea, fatigue, blurry vision, slurred speech and dazed appearance</p>

<p>Later that day, she went on to hospital and doctors diagnosed her with concussion, before sending her home to rest.</p>

<p>'If I could describe it, it would be my brain is coming out of my eyes and my ears, and I was just screaming in pain. I have endometriosis which is really bad, I thought I'd experienced bad pain, and I have not,' she said.</p>

<p>A few days later, her family rushed her back to hospital and doctors revealed she'd experienced a traumatic brain injury.</p>
