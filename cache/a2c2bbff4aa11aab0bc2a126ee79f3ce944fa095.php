<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Argentina men's rugby team have been rocked by six new coronavirus cases in their team putting the four-nation Rugby Championship in serious doubt.</p>

<p>The Argentine Rugby Union (UAR) named the six players to have contracted the virus, with the list of Pumas players including back Emiliano Boffelli.</p>

<p>Juan Cruz Mallia, Bautista Delguy, Juan Bautista Pedemonte, Rodrigo Fernandez Criado and Lucas Bur have been confirmed as the other players who have COVID-19, with all of the players 'already fulfilling preventive isolation'.</p>

<p>The Argentina men's rugby team has been rocked by six new coronavirus cases in their squad</p>

<p>Emiliano Boffelli (above) has been confirmed as one of the six players to have COVID-19</p>

<p>A UAR statement on Friday said: 'After completing a new round of tests in order to minimize the risk of contagion and be able to start the health bubble, the results yielded six positive cases of COVID-19 in the campus.' </p>

<p>The national team were preparing to go into a two-week bio-secure bubble on Friday in preparation for the Rugby Championship where they will face South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. </p>

<p>All the players were tested before entering the bubble, while the six players who tested positive were asymptomatic.</p>

<p>The Argentine Rugby Union have claimed that Bautista Delguy (above) is another player</p>

<p>Tournament officials hope that the Rugby Championship will still go ahead, with the event pencilled in between November 7 and December 12. </p>

<p>South Africa are unlikely to be able to put forward a team for the tournament due to a lack of domestic rugby taking place in the country in preparation for the event. </p>

<p>This is not the first time a member of the Argentina squad has tested positive for coronavirus since the outbreak. Loose forward Javier Oretego Desio was also diagnosed with the virus last month. </p>
