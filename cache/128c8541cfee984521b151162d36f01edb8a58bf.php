<p>Political activism: Miley candidly discussed the importance of heading to the polls and voting this upcoming US presidential election in a recent interview with Nova 96.9′s Fitzy &amp; Wippa</p>

<p>Although Miley has recently been focused on promoting her new single Midnight Sky, the actress and singer recently opened up about politics stakes in the US' upcoming November election.</p>

<p>'Listen I'm 27 and I know I've never experienced an election this important in my life and hopefully not again in my lifetime,' she said in a recent interview with Nova 96.9′s Fitzy &amp; Wippa. </p>

<p>She encouraged all young folks to do their part to encourage and help others to go to the polls and cast their votes. </p>

<p>'I can't express the importance enough, especially if young people getting out there and being active and making sure that their friends, their family are voting and have the information about whether it's mailing in, about the state of our country right now.'</p>

<p>The Party In The U.S.A. singer continued and said it was essential to get 'someone fit for the job of running our country' into office.</p>

<p>'Mascara dripped down my face': In the same interview, she admitted that a bender just before coronavirus lockdowns began in March inspired her new single Midnight Sky; shown in June 2019</p>

<p>Calling it a night: The Wrecking Ball singer explained that she forced herself to go home after catching a glimpse of her 'horrible, sweaty and flat' appearance; still from Midnight Sky</p>

<p>During the same interview, Miley revealed that her new single was inspired by an out-of-control bender she went on shortly before multiple US states began quarantining in March.</p>

<p>Addressing Midnight Sky's lyrics, 'it's been a long night and the mirror's tellin' me to go home', she explained that it was 'inspired by one of the last nights she went out before the Corona[virus] craziness and lockdown.'</p>

<p>'I went and performed at the Morrison hotel anniversary with The Doors,' she continued.</p>

<p>'I ended up going out that night, and I went to take a picture because there was so many icons, Billy Idol, all these legends.</p>

<p>'I go to take a picture, and it was on selfie-style. With all this partying, I looked horrible, sweaty and flat, mascara dripping down my face and I thought well it's time to go home!' she admitted </p>

<p>Cheeky choice: Miley performed a soulful rendition last week of Hall &amp; Oates' hit 1982 track, Maneater, after ending her nearly year-long romance with Cody Simpson in August </p>

<p>Miley's new single was released just as news broke that she and her boyfriend Cody Simpson had split up.</p>

<p>The Hannah Montana star confirmed that she and the 23-year-old Australian singer, whom she has known for a decade, called it quits on an Instagram Live clip in mid-August. </p>

<p>In her message on Instagram, she referenced her divorce from her ex-husband Liam Hemsworth, which was announced in August last year, in a move that reportedly surprised the actor.</p>

<p>'A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I'm just not accepting that,' she said.</p>

<p>'So today, it came out that me and my boyfriend have broken up,' she continued.</p>

<p>Miley later referenced the two men last week on The Tonight Show, when she made the unorthodox choice to perform a cover of Hall &amp; Oates' 1982 hit Maneater.</p>

<p>Beware: 'I'm freshly single, so anyone watching that's my future ex-husband, just know, I told you,' she teased on The Tonight Show, after singing about being a seductive woman who uses men</p>
