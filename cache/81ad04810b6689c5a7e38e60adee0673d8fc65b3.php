<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Owen Farrell is out of Saracens' Heineken European Cup quarter-final against Leinster - and a potential semi-final too - after receiving a five-match ban for his reckless hit on Wasps rookie Charlie Atkinson.</p>

<p>The England captain faced a disciplinary hearing by video link and was found guilty of a dangerous tackle, which earned him a red card during last Saturday's Premiership encounter at Allianz Park. Farrell accepted the charge, but his relatively clean record and good character worked in his favour.</p>

<p>He was ruled to have committed a 'top-end' offence - due to forceful contact with Atkinson's head - but the three-man judicial panel applied the maximum 50 per cent reduction, to halve the recommended 10-game suspension. He is free to play again on October 5, by which time Saracens' Premiership campaign will be over, so Farrell has made his last top-flight appearance for at least a year. </p>

<p>Panel chairman Mike Hamlin said: 'It was accepted by the RFU, the player and the panel that the offending was reckless and not intentional. This was a totally unacceptable contact with the neck/head of Charlie Atkinson as a result of a reckless tackle which had the consequences of him being knocked unconscious and sustaining a concussion. This resulted in the panel concluding that this was a top-end offence with an entry point of 10 matches. There were no aggravating features.</p>

<p>'Testimonials provided by Mark McCall, Eddie Jones and the founders of a charity with which the player works very closely were of the highest quality. The panel concluded that applying the off-field mitigating factors, notwithstanding his suspension four-and-a-half years ago, the player was entitled to a reduction from 10 matches to five meaningful matches.' </p>

<p>The designated ban end-date of October 5 will apply whether or not Saracens manage to beat near-invincible Leinster in Dublin without him - as he would either appear in the European semi-final or in a Premiership fixture instead. Being ruled out of the momentous showdown at the Aviva Stadium in 10 days' time is a savage setback.</p>

<p>The England captain went in nastily high on Wasps rookie Charlie Atkinson</p>

<p>The England international was given his marching orders for a high tackle on Charlie Atkinson</p>

<p>That is the grand occasion which Championship-bound Saracens have been prioritising before having to accept relegation as the penalty for their past salary cap infringements. But now, Farrell has been denied the right to square up to good friend Jonny Sexton and so many other Irish Lions.</p>

<p>His ban reflects the severity of the wild, high, swinging-arm tackle on Atkinson which drew widespread criticism. Farrell knew it was bad. He lay with his head in his hands, accepted the red card without complaint and waited by the touchline to apologise to his teenage rival. These spur-of-the-moment actions will have helped him avoid a harsher sanction.</p>

<p>His club will pay for his loss of control, as will the player himself, but there will be no impact on England's autumn plans. Eddie Jones can select his captain throughout a busy period featuring a non-cap match against the Barbarians, the rescheduled Six Nations decider against Italy in Rome and an Eight Nations tournament including pool fixtures against Wales, Ireland and Georgie, and a possible final in early December.</p>

<p>The England captain will miss out on the chance to face Jonny Sexton's Leinster in the Heineken European Cup quarter-final at the Aviva Stadium as well as a potential semi-final</p>

<p>Championship-bound Saracen are desperate to defend their European title this season</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Atkinson's season may be over. While Wasps are mustering a compelling play-off challenge, their young fly-half could play no part in it. His director of rugby, Lee Blackett, said: 'He won't be doing anything for a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>'We look after these younger guys, especially with a pretty tough head knock. He's not been in so we've left him at home. From the text messages I've had with him, everything seems alright.'</p>
