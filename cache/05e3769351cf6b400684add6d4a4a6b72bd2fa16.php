<p>Other features include an automatic temperature control knob, power and ready light indicator and a cord-wrap for compact storage.</p>

<p>The new product comes after shoppers went wild over the retailer's red-coloured churro maker, which has since sold out.</p>

<p>'Thank you Kmart. I love churros but was always put off with the deep frying, this is a much healthier way of cooking them (minus the slathering of melted butter and cinnamon sugar after they were cooked),' one shopper wrote in her glowing review.</p>

<p>'Worked amazingly! Plus I made just enough churros for us to try (the batch makes heaps of batter) then I put the bottle with the rest of the batter in the fridge.'</p>

<p>One woman - who owns the previous model - shared a glowing review, saying the churros maker 'worked amazingly'</p>
