<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Chelsea's record signing Kai Havertz has earned glowing reviews after his first training sessions with the club, according to reports.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old playmaker sealed an £89million move to west London earlier this month from Bayer Leverkusen and is expected to play an integral role in the new-look team next season.</p>

<p>It appears Havertz is ready and raring for his Premier League debut with Goal claiming that he has impressed with his hard work at the club's Cobham complex.</p>

<p>Chelsea's £89million signing Kai Havertz has impressed during his first training sessions</p>

<p>The 21-year-old, who joined from Bayer Leverkusen, is said to have earned glowing reviews</p>

<p>He began training with his new Chelsea team-mates on Saturday, less than 24 hours after jetting out to England to officially put pen to paper on his lucrative five-year deal.</p>

<p>Havertz has been put through his paces by coaching staff in a bid to get him in perfect shape for the club's opening top flight fixture against Brighton on September 14. </p>

<p>The recent indications from Chelsea's camp suggest that the superstar will almost certainly start on the south coast.</p>

<p>His arrival extended the Stamford Bridge outfit's remarkable £230m summer spending spree. Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner will often combine with the Germany international next season as part of a lethal strike force.</p>

<p>Havertz sealed the club-record switch on Saturday and has been preparing for the new season</p>

<p>Timo Werner has also been recruited during the hefty £230m spending spree this summer</p>

<p>Xavier Mbuyamba, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva have also been recruited as part of the push for silverware. </p>

<p>Havertz scored 18 goals and laid on nine assists in 45 appearances for Leverkusen last season - and the move now makes him the joint-most expensive player ever signed by a British club.</p>

<p>The highly-rated forward has admitted that his decision to head to England was largely swayed by Blues boss Frank Lampard's 'big impact'.</p>

<p>'Of course he had a big impact on my decision because I loved him as a player and watched him very often, and I think I can learn from him now he is a manager as well,' he told the official club website. </p>

<p>Havertz is expected to start from the off in Chelsea's clash against Brighton on September 14</p>

<p>'I think he is a very humble person and a great guy and I can't wait to play with him and learn from him.</p>

<p>'He was very offensive like me and he loves to score goals, and I love to score goals as well so I think he will help me a lot in my position. Also maybe on the things that I can improve and I can't wait to work with him.' </p>

<p>Goal have also reported that fellow new signing Ben Chilwell is expected to miss the first two games of the new season, however, due to a heel injury. </p>
