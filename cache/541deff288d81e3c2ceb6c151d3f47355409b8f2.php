<p>14 migrants were found in a boat in another attempted crossing of the English Channel.</p>

<p>They were brought ashore in three separate boats by Border Force officials.</p>

<p>This comes after 21 migrants made the journey across the Channel to the UK over the weekend in two separate crossings.</p>

<p>Sunday's arrivals meant that at least 5,600 refugees had made the journey this year, with six more having to be rescued from an inflatable boat near Calais after suffering engine failure.</p>

<p>Five men and one woman were picked up by coastal maritime surveillance cruiser Escaut and returned to border police at Boulogne-sur-Mer at 2.50pm on Sunday.     </p>

<p>14 migrants were picked up in the Channel this morning and brought back to Dover. The RNLI transported the people using three separate boats</p>

<p>No successful crossings were recorded on Saturday as far-right protesters clashed with police in Dover in reaction to a pro-migrant demonstration being held in the Kent town.</p>

<p>Ten people were arrested following demonstrations in Dover on Saturday, which brought a dual carriageway to a standstill.</p>

<p>Rival protests took place in the Kent town just days after a record 416 migrants made it to the UK after crossing the English Channel.</p>

<p>The protest comes days after a record 416 migrants in 28 boats reached the UK.</p>

<p>Clandestine Channel Threat Commander Dan O'Mahoney said: 'These crossings are facilitated by criminals willing to risk people's lives for money. France is a safe country with a fully functioning asylum system – those seeking refuge can and should claim asylum there.</p>

<p>'I am working with my counterparts in France daily to make this route totally unviable, with more migrants prevented from leaving the French coastline today.</p>

<p>21 migrants made the journey across the Channel to the UK over the weekend in two separate crossings</p>

<p>'We continue to return those who do not have a legitimate asylum claim despite barriers to removals under the Dublin Regulations and legal challenges.'</p>

<p>Following days of bad weather, a flurry of migrant boats managed to cross the busy shipping lanes of the Dover strait to the UK on Wednesday, last week. </p>

<p>At least 416 migrants packed onto two dozen boats for the crossing, a new single-day record.            </p>

<p>On Thursday, senior Home Office and immigration figures appeared before the Home Affairs Committee, which is conducting an inquiry into migrant crossings.</p>

<p>Chairwoman Yvette Cooper pressed them for answers on whether the Home Office will have any legal authority to return migrants to countries like France after December 31.</p>

<p>However she did not receive a full answer to the question, which she said she was 'really surprised' about.</p>

<p>Tim Loughton, MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, asked Mr O'Mahoney about suggestions made by a French politician that migrants come to the UK because it is easier to work illegally and 'live undercover'.</p>

<p>Mr Loughton said: 'It would appear that French members of parliament are party to putting around these misconceptions about how they are actually going to be looked after if they do make it to the UK.</p>

<p>'That's part of the problem, isn't it, that people are coming here on a false premise?'</p>

<p>Mr O'Mahoney replied: 'I think that's absolutely correct.'</p>

<p>Later the same day, Home Secretary Priti Patel used Twitter to hail the deportation of 11 Syrian nationals to Spain.</p>

<p>No successful crossings were recorded on Saturday as far-right protesters clashed with police in Dover in reaction to a pro-migrant demonstration being held in the Kent town</p>

<p>She also continued her attacks on 'activist lawyers' which she says are frustrating the removal of migrants.</p>

<p>Amanda Pinto QC, chair of the Bar Council, said that lawyers should not be political targets for simply doing their jobs.</p>

<p>Concerns were raised over the deportation of the 11 Syrians when it emerged that they had been left 'confused and distressed' when they ended up alone on the streets of Madrid.</p>

<p>When their UK Government-chartered flight touched down in Spain authorities declined responsibility for them, and they were left alone until an aid group picked them up. </p>
