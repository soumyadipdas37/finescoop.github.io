<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A black man has filed a $2.5 million claim against the Arizona city of Tempe, saying a 'hyperaggresive' police officer held him at gunpoint while looking for a white suspect at a hotel where he worked.</p>

<p>The claim - a precursor to a lawsuit - was filed on Wednesday by hotel employee Trevonyae Cumpian stemming from his August 29 detention by Tempe police Officer Ronald Kerzaya, the Arizona Republic reported.</p>

<p>Body-camera footage showed Kerzaya responded to the Hawthorn Suites hotel after receiving a call about a man with a gun. Kerzaya was initially without backup, and a manager told him that the armed man was white.</p>

<p>The manager, watching surveillance cameras, told Kerzaya that the gunman was headed for a particular exit, and the cop rushed outside and waited by the exterior door. </p>

<p>Trevonyae Cumpian, 28, filed a $2.5M claim against Tempe on Wednesday</p>

<p>The incident occurred at the the Hawthorn Suites hotel in Tempe on August 29, when management called 911 to report a man roaming the building with a gun</p>

<p>While guarding the exit door, the footage shows, Kerzaya held Cumpian, who works as a front-desk employee, at gunpoint despite Cumpian not matching the suspect description. </p>

<p>Kerzaya would not lower his gun until he confirmed the man was a hotel employee, which took about two minutes.</p>

<p>He then can be seen pointing his weapon at three others as he searches for the suspect, who was not found.</p>

<p>The claim calls for Kerzaya, who has been moved to an administrative role pending an investigation, to be terminated due to his 'blatant and continual abusiveness toward Black men.'</p>

<p>At a news conference Wednesday, Cumpian said he was racially profiled by Kerzaya.</p>

<p>'Once things became hostile and he said I fit the description and had me get down to my knees with the gun on me, all I could think about was my daughter, my family, and my life flashed before my eyes,' Cumpian said. 'I thought I was going to die.'</p>

<p>The manager (above), watching surveillance cameras, told Officer Kerzaya that the gunman was headed for a particular exit, and the cop rushed outside and waited by the exterior door</p>

<p>When Cumpian exited the door that Kerzaya was guarding, Kerzaya ordered him to put his hands up. Cumpian is black, and the suspect description was of a white male</p>

<p>Cumpian complained that he was a hotel employee and told Kerzaya to stop pointing his gun at him, which seemed to enrage Kerzaya who told him to stop talking back</p>

<p>Nikki Ripley, a spokeswoman for the city, said the city hasn't yet received Cumpian's claim.</p>

<p>Benjamin Crump, one of Cumpian´s attorneys, said his client deescalated the situation, while Kerzaya seemed to do the opposite.</p>

<p>The police department previously said its initial review shows the encounter wasn't handled with the professionalism or respect expected of its officers. An internal investigation is being conducted.</p>

<p>Kerzaya and the department came under fire for a 2019 incident in which Kerzaya used a stun gun on Ivaughn Oakry, who was holding his 1-year-old child in his own home.</p>

<p>The claim involving Cumpian seeks $2.5 million for emotional trauma and related therapy.</p>

<p>Kerzaya held Cumpian at gunpoint for about two minutes, until he confirmed that he was actually a hotel employee</p>

<p>Once confirming Cumpian's identity, Kerzaya told him to leave the area and wait in the lobby</p>

<p>The claim also alleges a cover-up by the department to keep Kerzaya's past conduct quiet. </p>

<p>The attorneys said officials attempted to avoid providing the officer's badge number and, when they did, they provided Kerzaya´s middle name of Aaron, instead of Ronald. </p>

<p>They later provided his full name and Cumpian quickly discovered Kerzaya was at the center of an excessive-force lawsuit filed by Oakry.</p>

<p>The department stood by Kerzaya and the other officers involved following the Oakry incident. </p>

<p>An investigation determined their actions were within policy and Kerzaya underwent mandatory re-training in contact communication, defense tactics and enhanced de-escalation techniques.</p>
