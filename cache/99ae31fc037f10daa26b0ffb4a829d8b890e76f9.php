<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bradley Cooper and his ex-partner Irina Shayk have not been seen together in public since February of this year when at a British Vogue event.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday the 45-year-old A Star Is Born actor and the 34-year-old supermodel were spotted in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City as their daughter Lea De Seine, aged three, sat in a stroller.</p>

<p>The Oscar winner was seen giving the catwalk expert a close hug on a sidewalk before he doted on his little girl.</p>

<p>On good terms: Bradley Cooper and his ex Irina Shayk shared a close hug on the street of the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City while with their daughter Lea on Monday</p>

<p>Better now: The two have not been seen together since February 2020 when they were at a party thrown by British Vogue</p>

<p>The former power couple started dating in April 2015 when they attended the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, went official in March 2016 during Paris Fashion Week party, welcomed Lea in March 2017 and split in June 2019.</p>

<p>They were last seen in February arm in arm at the British Vogue and Tiffany &amp; Co. celebrate Fashion and Film Party at Annabel’s.</p>

<p>The two share custody of Lea who is seen often with both mom and dad in New York City. But seeing all three together is a rarity.</p>

<p>Not the norm: The two share custody of Lea who is seen often with both mom and dad in New York City. But seeing all three together is a rarity</p>

<p>Details: The two were outside shops as Cooper doted on his child. Irina looked happy as she smiled away, her short hair worn down as she flaunted her trim tummy with a white crop top</p>

<p>Her accessories were razor thin black sunglasses and black military boots. </p>

<p>Fashionable lady: The cover girl added colorful high-waisted jeans that were beige in front and light blue on the sides</p>

<p>Bradley looked like he was heading to the gym with a white zip-up jacket, pulled up black sweatpants and black high-top sneakers.</p>

<p>The Alias veteran added a black cap over his closely cropped hair.</p>

<p>Little Lea was in her stroller as she looked up at mom and dad. She had on a mustard yellow cardigan over a white dress with white socks and sneakers while holding a pink and white cup with a straw.</p>

<p>In January Irina touched on her relationship with Bradley when she sat down with Harper's Bazaar magazine.  </p>

<p>'I think in all good relationships you bring your best and your worst  - it's just the nature of a human being,' Shayk said. 'Two great people don't have to make a good couple.'</p>

<p>The right look: Her accessories were razor thin black sunglasses and black military boots</p>

<p>Cute as can be: Little Lea had on a mustard yellow cardigan over a white dress with white socks and sneakers. She was holding on to a white and pink bottle with a straw</p>

<p>But she noted that she appreciated their union. </p>

<p>'I think we've been very lucky to experience what we had with each other,' continued the model. 'Life without B is new ground.'</p>

<p>She also touched on what it was like being a single mother. 'It's hard to find a balance between being a single mom and being a working woman and provider. Trust me, there are days I wake up and I’m like, "Oh my god, I don't know what to do, I'm falling apart."'</p>

<p>The star seems to have moved on. She has been seen several times with art dealer Vito Schnabel who used to date Amber Heard, then before that Heidi Klum. </p>

<p>Last few months of love: The duo split in June 2019 just four months after she went with him to the 91st Annual Academy Awards at Hollywood and Highland in Hollywood</p>

<p>Cooper has been a hands-on dad. He was seen just last weak with Leah on his shoulders in New York City.</p>

<p>He made sure to mask up for the outing in NYC's West Village, per CDC recommendations mid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

<p>Cooper revealed how he has been spending quarantine with his mother Gloria Campano and daughter Lea while speaking with Interview Magazine.</p>

<p>Bradley also said he had been 'running a one-man preschool' for Lea, whom he has been teaching how to swim in their bathtub.</p>

<p>'I'm with my daughter and my mother and my two dogs, and we have not left the house. My mother is going to be 80, and she has a colostomy bag, so I can't let anybody in the house. And I can't leave the house, because if she gets it, it's over,' he said.</p>

<p>'We live in a little townhouse, thankfully there's a backyard. I'm running a one-man preschool. We get up, we do swim class in the bathtub.' </p>

<p>Two years ago: They were very much a couple in August 2018 while in Venice, Italy</p>
