<p>Cheeky! The next day the starlet showcased her risque side, as she stripped off for a nude swim in her villa pool, while sharing snippets of the moment on social media</p>

<p>Stunning: The model, 25, put on a breathtaking display in a deeply plunging white lace maxi dress, which put her more than ample assets on full display</p>

<p>The model's Ibiza holiday comes after she discussed how she coped with grief after her parents' death.</p>

<p>The model suffered the loss of her father Barrie Mawby at the end of 2018, with tragedy striking again soon after when her mother Christine passed away in June 2019.</p>

<p>And amid her heartache, the star also discussed her mental health, telling how it almost 'got the better' of her during lockdown, in a candid chat to mark World Suicide Prevention Day.</p>

<p>Speaking to the Evening Standard, Demi said: 'It was almost surreal when my father died and then my mother so soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Look at that! Demi reclined against the edge of the pool, which looked out onto a stunning vista across the bay</p>

<p>'I felt angry, sad, bitter and lonely but I am just so lucky that I had a good support system to carry me.</p>

<p>'Being able to talk about grief is so important and not bottle it up. That’s why my message is so important to encourage people to talk.'</p>

<p>Demi added that though she's been through trauma, she's come out 'stronger' and tries to reflect her strength through her positive and 'confident' social media posts.</p>

<p>She went on: 'Behind closed doors there’s been a lot of torment and I suppose I have turned that into a positive as I feel I have been through so much nothing can push me down again'.</p>
