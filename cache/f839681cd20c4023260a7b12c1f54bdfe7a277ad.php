<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Detectives have been left stumped after a teenager was mysteriously found dead with blood on her face in bed in Western Australia. </p>

<p>Brooke Tuhakaraina's body was discovered by a friend in the home she shared with workmates in Port Denison, north of Perth, at about 7am on Wednesday morning.</p>

<p>Homicide detectives and forensics are investigating and awaiting the results of an autopsy.</p>

<p>As of early Thursday morning, there was no explanation for the 19-year-old's sudden death.  </p>

<p>Brooke Tuhakaraina (pictured) was found dead in her share house in Port Denison on WA</p>

<p>Devastated Dongra shearing contractor Mike Henderson said the teenager was found by a member of his staff in the home he lets to them. </p>

<p>'She was a wool handler, a nice kid,' he told The West Australian through tears. </p>

<p>'She was only 19 and she worked for me for a couple of months.' </p>

<p>Ms Tuhakaraina is originally from New Zealand and had been working in Western Australia for the past year.</p>

<p>Her family posted 'we are all devastated at this time,' on Facebook on Wednesday.</p>

<p>Police set up a crime scene, with neighbours saying the people who lived in the share house were constantly 'coming and going'.</p>

<p>Detectives (pictured at the scene) are investigating the site with forensics to determine Ms Tuhakaraina's cause of death</p>

<p>The small cray fishing town in WA's mid-west has been rocked by tragedy before.</p>

<p>Heather Glendinning murdered her daughters Jane, 12 and Jess, 10, before killing herself in the family home on December 5, 2011.  </p>

<p>The girls' father repeatedly warned of his ex-wife's deteriorating mental health.</p>

<p>'Their mother was not sane and fit to have custody of them - and no one wanted to hear that until it was too late,' he said in 2019.</p>

<p>At an inquest into the deaths in 2016, Coroner Barry King determined the tragedy was potentially avoidable.</p>

<p>He said the outcome could have been different if Glendinning's declining mental state had been discussed between the Family Court, mental health authorities and government agencies.  </p>
