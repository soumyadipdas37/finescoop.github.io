<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian home cooks have shared the secret ingredients in their family's spaghetti bolognese, including maple syrup, milk, mashed pumpkin and cinnamon.</p>

<p>As many revealed on social media they stick to the classic flavours such as tomatoes, garlic, onion and basil, others have taken the Italian dish to the next level.</p>

<p>'I add a pinch of cinnamon (it balances out the tomato) and a stock cube, a splash of fish sauce for depth and finally mashed carrot or zucchini for fibre. Wonderful tasting,' one woman wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>Some people said they preferred adding mashed vegetables such as pumpkin, carrots or sweet potatoes to the sauce to create a thick consistency.</p>

<p>'Mashed roast pumpkin or sweet potato. It thickens the sauce,' one woman wrote, while another woman said: 'I blend up cooked carrot and pumpkin for the liquid so it's a thick and creamy texture.'</p>

<p>Another controversial addition is milk, which is said to make the tomato-based sauce creamy and rich.</p>

<p>'Milk is the secret ingredient. No garlic in this one. I thought it was [gross] too but give it a try, it's amazing,' one woman said. </p>

<p>Another woman wrote: 'I use a dash of milk to take away the acidity of the tomatoes, BBQ sauce and about a tablespoon full of maple syrup. The kids love it.'</p>

<p>One home cook said her recipe includes carrot, onion, celery, pork and veal mince, bacon, red wine, beef stock, tomato paste and a cup of milk.</p>

<p>'It's the nicest so far,' she said.</p>

<p>Another woman suggested: 'Knob of butter makes it creamy and takes away acidity of the tomato.'</p>

<p>Many insisted their secret ingredient is a humble can of tomato soup, while others add a pinch of brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce.</p>

<p>'Brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce as well as crushed tomatoes, onions, garlic, tomato paste and only use pork and veal mince,' one woman wrote.</p>

<p>Another home cook said she follows her grandma's recipe, which includes carrots, celery, tin tomatoes, pork mince, bay leaf, Italian herbs, a dash of red wine, garlic, onion and a 'tiny bit of brown sugar'.</p>

<p>As many revealed they stick to the classic flavours such as tomatoes, garlic, onion and basil, others have taken the Italian dish to the next level. Many suggested they add milk as it makes the sauce creamy, while the mashed pumpkin creates a thick consistency (stock images)</p>

<p>Another added: 'The secret (and only) ingredient is Heinz tomato soup. Plus any vegetables you wish to add.'</p>

<p>One woman said she uses a combination of beef, lamb and pork mine, along with chorizo, garlic, chilli, Italian tomatoes, capsicum and mushroom.</p>

<p>'I cook it all up, It's so tasty,' she said. </p>

<p>But not everyone seemed to agree with the controversial ingredients, with one saying: 'My goodness so many people have ruined the traditional bolognese! My Nonna would be turning in her grave.'</p>

<p>One woman added: 'I'm Italian and just shaking my head,' while another home cook said: 'My Italian soul hurts with all these other ingredients.'</p>

<p>And one man added: 'Oh man some of these suggestions. Please leave this to the Italians.'</p>

<p>However, a chef, from South Australia, suggested there's no right or wrong recipe when it comes to the perfect spaghetti bolognese.</p>

<p>'I have been a chef for over 25 years, I've seen bolognese made 300 different ways,' he said.</p>
