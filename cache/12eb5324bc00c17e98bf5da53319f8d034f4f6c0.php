<p>Out and about: Jorgie Porter put on a very leggy display as she attended a social media event at Manchester's Foodwell on Thursday</p>

<p>The star, who played Theresa McQueen in the Channel 4 soap, paired her thigh-skimming dress with a long-line black leather jacket and slung a black bag across her body. </p>

<p>While she added a casual element to her look with a chunky pair of white trainers.</p>

<p>The former Dancing On Ice contestant left her blonde locks loose for the occasion, while she added a sleek palette of make-up.    </p>

<p>Jorgie's night out comes after her decision to try and spice up her love life with a spot of virtual dating during lockdown.</p>

<p>Looking good: The former Hollyoaks star, 32, looked chic in a ruched grey midi dress as she arrived at the event hosted by influencer Georgia Portogall</p>

<p>In April, the former soap star admitted she had to resort to FaceTime to try and get to know possible suitors after struggling to meet someone due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>She revealed she gets a lot of attention on dating apps, but wanted to try her hand at video dating while she has additional time on her hands.</p>

<p>Jorgie told New! magazine: 'I've had a FaceTime date. It's quite scary because you think we're just gonna sit face to face and say, "Hello, how are you?"</p>

<p>'It's kind of awkward, so it's good to do a creative activity like paint a picture together, which is what we did. It's cool because you see how much effort they've put in.</p>

<p>'So if they get their paints and canvas ready, you're like, "Ah, he wants to impress me".'</p>
