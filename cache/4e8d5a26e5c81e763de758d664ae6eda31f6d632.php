<p>Military police stopped the refuelling tanker as it was taxiing down the runway at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus.</p>

<p>The pilot and one crew member were arrested after allegedly failing a breathalyser test and taken to a military detention centre.</p>

<p>An insider said it came after station commanders became aware of a ‘riotous’ party at the base the night before in which fire extinguishers were set off as a prank.</p>

<p>The captain of an RAF Voyager (pictured: library image) was arrested on suspicion of drink-flying moments before his jet was due to take off</p>

<p>The source said: ‘An officer who got rudely woken up by the party decided to get his revenge on the Voyager crew by tipping off top brass at the air base.</p>

<p>‘The Voyager got as far as the runway “hold short” location before military police ordered it to stop.</p>

<p>They had really infuriated people the night before with their behaviour so somebody was always going to get their own back.</p>

<p>‘When people found out the drunken crew were due to fly the next day they had to brief the chain of command because at that stage there was a serious safety issue.’</p>

<p>Military police stopped the refuelling tanker as it was taxiing down the runway at RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus (pictured in 2013 with a  British Typhoon fighter jet landing)</p>

<p>Voyagers – known as the petrol stations of the skies – support sorties by RAF Lightning and Typhoon strike aircraft used for precision bombing of Islamic State strongholds in Iraq.</p>

<p>The RAF confirmed last week’s incident but declined to answer questions about the nature of the Voyager’s mission.</p>

<p>A spokesman said last night: ‘We are aware of an incident at RAF Akrotiri and it would be inappropriate to comment while an investigation is ongoing.’</p>
