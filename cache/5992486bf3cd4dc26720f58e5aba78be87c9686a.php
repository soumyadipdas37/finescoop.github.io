<p>Five-year-old rescue cat Poptart was sat with owners Emily, 29, and Zach Dale, 30, at their home in Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, when she began sneezing.</p>

<p>In a video shared on social media, Poptart launches into a sneezing frenzy and unleashes around 20 sneezes in just 11 seconds.</p>

<p>Poptart the five-year-old rescue cat launches into a fit of sneezes at her home inÂ Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, spraying spit on her owner's laptop</p>

<p>Poptart is sat close enough to Zach and his computer that when she starts sneezing, her bodily fluids shower the screen.</p>

<p>As he drags his screen away from Poptart in a desperate attempt to protect his computer, Zach is heard saying: 'Oh no. Look at those boogers!'</p>

<p>The sneezing fit had been caused by Poptart sniffing Zach's lunch.</p>

<p>Speaking about Poptart's sneezing fit, Emily said: 'Poptart never sneezes once, it's always rapid fire for her.</p>

<p>Owner Zach Dale, 30, tries to pull his laptop away while Poptart continues to sneeze. In the space of 11 seconds, Poptart sneezed around 20 times</p>

<p>'She has been to the vet and they said nothing is wrong, she's just a dramatic sneezer.</p>

<p>'I thought it was hilarious, as did my husband, although he was also impressed by her massive snot rocket and concerned for the laptop screen that was getting blasted by boogers.'</p>

<p>The video was originally posted on Instagram on August 24 on a page called 'THE CAT SQUAD' and has recently re-emerged.</p>

<p>The page features the adventures of a group of cats, including Poptart, and a corgi called Potato.</p>
