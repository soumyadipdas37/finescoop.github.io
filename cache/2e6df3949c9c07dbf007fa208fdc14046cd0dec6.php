<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jose Mourinho has taken a swipe at Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after he made light of the Tottenham manager measuring the goalposts at Shkendija. </p>

<p>Mourinho ordered UEFA to change the goalposts at the North Macedonian club's ground after he and his players realised the crossbar was five centimetres too low during the warm-up. </p>

<p>Solskjaer then made fun of Mourinho, who is himself a former Red Devils manager, following United's dramatic 3-2 victory over Brighton on Saturday. </p>

<p>Jose Mourinho has taken a swipe at Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after his goalposts jibe by suggesting the Manchester United manager is more focused on the 'dimensions of the 18-yeard box'</p>

<p>Mourinho had to get UEFA delegates to switch posts at Shkendija as they were 5cm too short</p>

<p>After a match in which Brighton hit the woodwork a record five times, Solskjaer told Sky Sports: 'We got away with one, to be fair.</p>

<p>'When they equalised I thought that's two points lost. Maybe one point was what we deserved – I don't think we deserved more but the character we showed deserved more.'</p>

<p>'We have to be grateful Jose (Mourinho) is not here to measure the goalposts, it might have been smaller goals.'</p>

<p>Mourinho decided to bite back in his pre-match interview before Tottenham's clash with Newcastle, alluding to the high volume of penalties awarded to Man United</p>

<p>Solskjaer joked that he was glad Mourinho had not measured the goalposts before United's clash with Brighton. Albion hit the woodwork five times at the Amex, a Premier League record</p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes scores a 100th-minute penalty to give United victory over Brighton</p>

<p>'I know the goalposts are fine,' Mourinho told Sky Sports. 'I think Ole yesterday was so happy and surprised with what happened to his team that he had a joke, but I understand that for him the dimensions of the goalpost are not important.</p>

<p>'For him, what is important is the dimensions of the 18-yard box. He would never accept to play with a 17-yard box I think he would prefer a 22-yard box. For him would be better.'</p>

<p>United were awarded 22 penalties last season and have continued in similar form in 2020-21, winning two spot-kicks in their first three games in all competitions. </p>

<p>Bruno Fernandes converted United's latest penalty to score a 100th-minute winner on the south coast, securing a first Premier League victory of the season.</p>
