<p>'I think if he’s going to do music, he’s going to make sure that that's secure, and then he'll bring us into his music,' he continued. 'And being inspired! He just had a new baby. I think that's going to be really inspiring for him and he'll have some new music based on that, I'm sure.'</p>

<p>DailyMail.com was first to share the news that Jessica and Justin had a second child adding Biel's mother Kimberly Conroe Biel was with her daughter and newest grandchild at the time of the birth. </p>

<p>The birth of the couple's new son comes months after Timberlake was caught getting close to his co-star Alisha Wainwright, 31, during a night out in New Orleans, Louisiana.</p>

<p>Timberlake and Wainwright were filming NFL movie Palmer at the time, in which they play lovers.</p>

<p>Onlookers told the Sun Timberlake, who was not wearing his wedding ring, appeared to have been drinking heavily but said he and Wainwright 'were smiling and laughing'. </p>

<p>Two weeks later, Timberlake apologized to Biel for the indiscretion with a public mea culpa posted on Instagram in which he admitted to drinking too much on the night in question.</p>

<p>In it, he said: 'I stay away from gossip as much as I can, but for my family, I feel it is important to address recent rumors that are hurting the people I love.</p>

<p>Voter: Jessica's last Instagram post was from Tuesday as she posted chest up in a hoodie with no makeup on</p>

<p>'A few weeks ago, I displayed a strong lapse in judgement – but let me be clear – nothing happened between me and my co-star.</p>

<p>'I drank way too much that night and I regret my behavior. I should have known better. This is not the example I want to set for my son.</p>

<p>'I want to apologize to my amazing wife and family for putting them through such an embarrassing situation, and I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be.</p>

<p>'This was not that. I am incredibly proud to be working on Palmer. Looking forward to continuing to make the movie and excited for people to see it.'</p>

<p>Neither Biel nor Wainwright have ever publicly addressed the incident.</p>
