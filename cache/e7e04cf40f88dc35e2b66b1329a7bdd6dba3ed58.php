<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Reese Witherspoon's Emmy Awards celebration may have looked very different this year, with the starlet swapping the red carpet for her backyard amid the coronavirus pandemic, but that didn't stop her from going all out with the glamour.</p>

<p>The 44-year-old hosted a socially-distanced Emmys viewing party at her home on Sunday alongside co-stars from Big Little Lies, Little Fires Everywhere, and The Morning Show - but despite the casual setting, she made sure that her look for the occasion was worthy of any A-list event. </p>

<p>After donning a stunning black Louis Vuitton dress, Reese then made sure that she was primped to perfection with the help of makeup artist Kelsey Deenihan, and hairstylist Lona Vigi, both of whom were happy to spill a few beauty secrets from the evening.   </p>

<p>Mane attraction: Reese Witherspoon rocked beautiful waves by celebrity hairstylist Lona Vigi. 'The inspiration for Reese was effortless hair that anyone watching tonight feels like they could recreate themselves. Attainable but still sophisticated for a special occasion,' said Lona</p>

<p>Girl next door: From Jameela Jamil's pajama set to Tracee Ellis Ross' gold ball gown, the dress code for television's biggest night was anything goes. But one thing that didn't disappoint was the glam factor</p>

<p>Both beauty pros worked to create a classic and sophisticated look for the Big Little Lies star, with Lona explaining that she wanted to give Reese a 'do that anyone watching at home could create themselves.  </p>

<p>'The inspiration for Reese was effortless hair that anyone watching tonight feels like they could recreate themselves. Attainable but still sophisticated for a special occasion,' she said.  </p>

<p>Lona then revealed just how simple it is to recreate the star's hairstyle in just a few steps and with a handful of tools.  </p>

<p>A good foundation is a must.</p>

<p>To get the Little Fires Everywhere star's blonde locks looking healthy, the pro started by applying a healing oil through the hair and working it into her dampened ends generously.  </p>

<p>Any beauty junkie knows that the secret to a salon-quality blowout is an effective hair dryer. </p>

<p>Lona blew dry Reese's hair with the GHD Helios Professional Hair Dryer, a light weight tool that promises faster drying and 30 per cent more shine, ensuring that the mom-of-three's locks would remain perfectly preened all night long.</p>

<p>And when it comes to hairbrushes, it's not just about the bristles; according to Lona, size really does matter, particular when you want to create those perfectly-coiffed waves. </p>

<p>Dress code 'Anything Goes': The fashions at last night's Emmys were like nothing we've ever seen before at the prestigious awards ceremony</p>

<p>Work wife! The show was nominated for Outstanding Limited Series and Kerry nominated for Lead Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her role of Mia Warren in the hit program</p>

<p>To create Reese's 'sophisticated' style, Lona opted for a size 3 GHD Natural Bristle Radial Brush 'to shape and grip the hair to lay a good foundation as you blowdry.'</p>

<p>Once her hair was dry, Lona went in with the GHD Platinum+ Styler in order to smooth the tresses, and eradicate any remaining frizz or flyaways. A lifesaver for the girl on the go, the straightener heats up fast, helping to shave time off Reese's glam prep, and allow her more opportunity to socialize with her guests. </p>

<p>According to the hair pro, running through the locks with the iron also helps the look to appear 'more polished', and ensures it lasts throughout the night. </p>

<p>The final step in the process was adding the waves with a curling iron - the GHD Curve Classic Wave Wand - before finally 'sculpting the style around the head' with the brand's Narrow Dressing Brush to ensure it perfectly framed the star's face.  </p>

<p>While the brush is not something that everyone might have in their beauty arsenal, it is a good tool to have on hand when fashioning an updo or ponytail to create a smooth silky finish.</p>

<p>For hold, Lona set the look with a shaping spray as she worked. </p>

<p>Moving on to makeup, Reese enlisted beauty pro Kelsey to  create a 'classic red carpet look' that complemented her old Hollywood hair and dress. </p>

<p>Proving that A-list beauty doesn't have to come with an over-the-top price tag, Kelsey used skincare products from budget-friendly brand The Inkey List to prep Reese's skin, with the total for all of the items used ringing in at just $55. </p>

<p>Head to toe: She wore a simple black Louis Vuitton dress featuring a V-neckline exposing a tasteful amount of cleavage</p>

<p>Masks on: Reese hosted a few cast mates (including Kerry Washington) in her backyard with New Year's Eve as the theme (party hats and festive sunglasses included)</p>

<p>The beauty pro explained that 'proper skin prep is always essential before starting with any color', and she made sure that Reese's complexion was fully hydrated before going in with any makeup. </p>

<p>First, Kelsey used The Inkey List Hyaluronic Acid, which she describes as a 'holy grail' ingredient, and she then applied the brand's Q10 Serum, 'which is chalk full of antioxidants' that 'protect the skin against damage caused by free radicals and the environment', an essential in Los Angeles in light of the recent fires.  </p>

<p>With a need for speed in mind, the makeup artist used the fast-absorbing Peptide Moisturizer, and then gave Reese's undereye area a bit of a boost with the Caffeine Eye Cream. </p>

<p>Finally, to prime the skin for makeup, Kelsey turned to The Inkey List Polyglutamic Acid, which she says is the 'perfect makeup base' because it not only adds moisture to the skin, but also creates a 'thin veil' that is the perfect canvas for foundation.</p>

<p>Kelsey then created a 'classic red carpet look' using products from Pat McGrath Labs, focusing on a 'warm neutral eye' and a matte red lip. After emphasizing Reese's naturally-radiant complexion with the Skin Fetish: Sublime Perfection Foundation and Concealer, she then used the Mthrsp Mega: Celestial Divinity Palette on the eyes. </p>

<p>She then accentuated the look with the Perma Gel Ultra Glide Eye Pencil and applied 'a few generous coats' of the Dark Star Mascara 'for maximum drama'. </p>

<p>Finally, Reese's pout was perfected with the Elson 2 Mattetrance Lipstick and the Perma Gel Lip Pencil. Et voila! </p>
