<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A face-tattooed murderer who was handcuffed to a security guard while being escorted to her prison has escaped from custody and is on the run. </p>

<p>Katrina Epiha managed to free herself from two prison guards while being taken back to Auckland Women's Corrections Facility from Middlemore Hospital on Friday morning.</p>

<p>The 22-year-old was handcuffed to a corrections officer and flanked by another when she broke free and was last seen near Gray Avenue in Mangere about 12.30pm.</p>

<p>Katrina Epiha (pictured) escaped custody from two corrections officers in Auckland on Friday</p>

<p>'The prisoner required off-site medical treatment for an injury that could not be carried out at the prison,' Department of Corrections Regional Commissioner Lynette Cave told NZ Herald.</p>

<p>'She was accompanied by two Corrections Officers. The prisoner was handcuffed to one of those Corrections Officers.</p>

<p>'A full operational review into the circumstances of the incident is being carried out.'</p>

<p>Ms Cave said police have been searching for the fugitive since her escape and was unable to provide any further details on Epiha's getaway.</p>

<p>Police have appealed for anyone with information on Epiha's whereabouts to contact them.</p>

<p>'Katrina is considered dangerous and should not be approached by the public,' a New Zealand police media release reads.</p>

<p>Epiha was last seen on Gray Avenue in Mangere after fleeing from security guards on Friday</p>

<p>Anyone helping Epiha evade law enforcement will also face charges.</p>

<p>Epiha was last seen wearing a black long-sleeved top with a white shirt underneath, grey track pants and light pink running shoes.</p>

<p>She has large distinctive tattoos on both sides of her face.</p>

<p>Epiha killed mother Alicia Maree Nathan after an argument about music at a house party in Avonhead, Christchurch in August 2017.</p>

<p>She was only 18 when she stabbed the 32-year-old several times with a kitchen knife in an alcohol-fuelled rage.</p>

<p>Epiha also threatened to kill another woman before fleeing the party after telling others not to call for help.</p>

<p>The murder was described as a 'senseless impulsive act of extreme violence' by Crown Prosecutor Mitch McClenaghan during her trial.</p>

<p>While Justice Gerald Nation acknowledged her troubled upbringing among gangs with repeated violence and neglect had led to a pattern of violent behaviour.</p>

<p>Epiha was sentenced to at least ten years in prison in May 2019, as part of a life sentence over the murder charge.</p>

<p>She is facing another five year charge for escaping custody - on top of her existing prison sentence.</p>
