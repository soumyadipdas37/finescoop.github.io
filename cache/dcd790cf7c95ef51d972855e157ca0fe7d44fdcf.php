<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's video calls are interrupted by their son Archie who 'climbs in front of the web camera and makes little impromptu cameos', their biographer has claimed.</p>

<p>The Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex, 39, have continued to work with their favourite charities and initiatives throughout the global pandemic, regularly joining Zoom calls from their new $14million mansion in Santa Barbara.</p>

<p>But the working parents' Zoom calls sometimes feature an unexpected guest appearance from their one-year-old son, Archie, according to Finding Freedom author Omid Scobie.</p>

<p>Speaking on his podcast Heirpod, the royal commentator explained that Archie is 'no stranger' to creating the adorable interruptions.</p>

<p>Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's video calls are often interrupted by their son Archie who 'climbs in front of the web camera and makes little impromptu cameos', their biographer has claimed. Pictured, the family in September 2019</p>

<p>'I loved discovering their daily Zoom calls with the various initiatives and people that they work with. And how Archie is no stranger to climbing in front of the web camera and making little impromptu cameos,' Omid said.</p>

<p>Archie's cousin Prince Louis can relate, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge admitting that their 2-year-old son can't resist ending his parents' calls.</p>

<p>'For some reason, he sees the red button and he always wants to press the red button', Prince William, 38, told the BBC in April.</p>

<p>The Duke, 35, and Duchess of Sussex (pictured together recently), 39, have continued to work with their favourite charities and initiatives throughout the global pandemic, regularly joining Zoom calls from their new $14million mansion in Santa Barbara</p>

<p>Archie's already experienced in front of a camera, with the youngster appearing on a video with his mother Meghan for his first birthday.</p>

<p>In May, the duchess was captured reading one of her son's favourite books, Duck! Rabbit!, to him in support of Save The Children UK. </p>

<p>It comes following claims from a royal expert that the monarchy has been 'left looking over its shoulder' at Prince Harry and Meghan following their Netflix megadeal.</p>

<p>The couple have signed a new deal with the streaming service which could be worth as much as $150million, and say they want to provide 'hope and inspiration' with their upcoming projects.</p>

<p>Prince Harry and Meghan failed to tell the Queen, 94, about their Netflix deal before announcing it to the world, with aides telling her about the couple's new venture - which involves a yet-to-be-named production company set on making documentaries, feature films and children's programming.</p>

<p>Writing in Town and Country, royal expert Victoria Murphy said the monarchy had been left 'looking over its shoulder', saying: 'Family members will be hoping that Harry and Meghan stick to the pledge that they made to “uphold the values of Her Majesty” in “everything they do.”'</p>
