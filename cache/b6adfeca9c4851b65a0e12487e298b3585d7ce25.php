<p>This is the heart-breaking moment bride Nicole Lind, dressed all in white, surprised her terminally ill mother Elizabeth Bridgewater by arranging a wedding in just five days - having sworn never to get married</p>

<p>Mrs Lind, 30, left Mrs Bridgewater, 71, speechless when she turned up at her hospital bed in full wedding attire and asked her mother to give her away for her wedding to James</p>

<p>Mrs Lind and husband James got married in the hospital where her mother was being treated for lung cancer (above). Mrs Bridegwater Mail Online: ‘When Nicole came in wearing a wedding dress I thought it was a joke. I just remember being so proud' </p>

<p>Mrs Lind and her fiance James got married earlier this month in the hospital where her mother was being treated for lung cancer, with only a handful of people present due to coronavirus.</p>

<p>Mrs Bridgewater, a retired school cleaner, told MailOnline: ‘When Nicole came in wearing a wedding dress I thought it was a joke. I couldn’t take it in and I just remember being so proud. </p>

<p>'The nurses were angels and I can’t believe they managed to keep it a secret.'</p>

<p>The idea for the spontaneous wedding came when Mrs Bridgewater, a widow, was given the devastating news that she only had a few weeks to live after two years of chemotherapy and treatment.</p>

<p>Mrs Lind said: ‘Mum broke down, which rarely happened. She was in tears and said she was sad she would never see her baby girl get married.</p>

<p>’I knew I had to do something. I spoke to James about it on the Monday and he said yes to the idea straight away and we started planning.</p>

<p>‘By Saturday we were married.’</p>

<p>All the preparations were made without Mrs Bridgewater's knowledge so it would be a massive surprise.</p>

<p>All the preparations were made without Mrs Bridgewater's knowledge so it would be a massive surprise. ’It was only confirmed on Thursday evening that we could get married at 2.15pm on Saturday September 5 and that’s when we started telling family,’ Mrs Lind said</p>

<p>Mrs Lind (with her mother before she fell ill) said the dress arrived in three days : ’Someone was looking down on us because the two rings James and I liked in the jewellers were only available in our size’</p>

<p>’It was only confirmed on Thursday evening that we could get married at 2.15pm on Saturday September 5 and that’s when we started telling family,’ Mrs Lind said.</p>

<p>’My elder brother Colin insisted he would buy me a dress and I got it online from ASOS, but I was prepared to go in jeans and a T-shirt.</p>

<p>‘We got an email saying it wouldn’t come until Saturday which would have been too late – but luckily it came on the Friday.</p>

<p>’Someone was looking down on us because the two rings James and I liked in the jewellers were only available in our size.’  </p>

<p>Mrs Lind had to get special permission from the hospital because of strict Covid-19 rules, and the small wedding party was only allowed in a small space in the hospital, with chairs set at least 2m apart.</p>

<p>The bride admitted being nervous as she was led by a nurse along the corridor to her mother’s room.</p>

<p>’She was tired and pale when I walked in but all of a sudden she was glowing. She kept asking me if this was a dream.</p>

<p>‘I wanted the mother and daughter chat and to put some mousse in her hair and do her mascara and lipstick.’</p>

<p>After helping their mother get ready, Mrs Lind and her sister wheeled their mother down for the ceremony where the immediate family had gathered.</p>

<p>The newlyweds grabbed a cheese wrap from the canteen before a limo took them to the botanic gardens in Glasgow for pictures. ’I will never forget it,' said Mrs Lind. 'Doing this for my mum meant the world'</p>

<p>‘Mum took me down the aisle and when I saw James the floodgates opened,’ she recalled.</p>

<p>’He was crying too. Mum was taken aback to see my two brothers and sister and James’ mum and sister and she said she hadn’t had a gathering like this since before Christmas.</p>

<p>’The ceremony lasted an hour and the nurses surprised us by decorating Mum’s room.</p>

<p>’We went back for tea and cake and she absolutely loved it.’</p>

<p>’I will never forget it. Doing this for my mum meant the world.</p>

<p>’Since the wedding she has perked up and is now being allowed to come home so she can be with us at the end. I’m so glad I made her dying wish come true.’</p>

<p>Mrs Bridgewater added: ’I loved every minute of it – even the sneaky sip of Prosecco Nicole gave me.’</p>

<p>The grandmother-of-four moved from her home in Lochgilphead, Argyll, to Glasgow two years ago when she was first diagnosed. </p>

<p>She moved in with Mr and Mrs Lind, who supported her through several gruelling bouts of chemotherapy. </p>

<p>Company team leader Nicole, however, was more ambivalent about getting hitched to the hotel worker she first met seven years ago.</p>

<p>She said: ‘I never wanted to get married or have children. I said from the off that if that was what he wanted I wasn’t the girl for him. But he stuck by me.’</p>

<p>On Valentine’s Day 2016, James intended to propose on one knee, only for Nicole to unwittingly torpedo the plan with an off-hand remark about Valentine’s Day proposals being ‘soppy’.</p>

<p>Undaunted, James took the next day off and decided to propose anyway.</p>

<p>’After work, I walked into my house and saw candles and flowers and I smelt food. When I walked into the kitchen he was in a three piece suit and down on one knee.' </p>

<p>Nicole said yes, but the couple never got round to setting a day, and then when her mother fell ill, she became their priority.</p>

<p>Mrs Bridgewater said: ’I watched James and Nicole say their vows and I knew they meant every word and I know he will always look after my daughter.</p>

<p>’Despite the cancer, I have had the best two years of my life.’ </p>
