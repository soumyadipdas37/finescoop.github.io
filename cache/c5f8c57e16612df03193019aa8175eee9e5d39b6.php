<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Co-op Bank is axing 18 branches and slashing 350 jobs, in another blow to Britain's beleaguered high streets. </p>

<p>The loss-making lender blamed the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, as it said the job cuts would affect branch staff, middle managers and head office workers. </p>

<p>Sign of the times: The loss-making lender blamed the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus</p>

<p>It means that the Co-op Bank, which dates back to 1872 and was founded to provide more ethical service to its customers, will soon have just 50 branches. And in a worrying sign for business owners and customers, it takes the number of closures announced across all banks for 2020 to 265. </p>

<p>TSB is planning to close 82 branches this year. Lloyds Bank has also announced 56 branch closures and Natwest said this month it was cutting 550 jobs in branches. </p>

<p>Since January 2015, the number of bank branches across the UK has tumbled by 3,364 to 6,439, says consumer champion Which?. </p>

<p>Co-Op Bank's chief executive Andrew Bester said: 'Unfortunately, we're not immune to the impact of recent events, with the historically low base rate affecting the income of all banks and a period of prolonged economic uncertainty ahead, which means it's important we reduce costs and have the right-sized operating model in place for the future.'</p>
