<p>Crockham House, in Kent, was built in the 15th century and boasts seven bedrooms, five bathrooms, two kitchens and sitting rooms, a drawing room and a studio.</p>

<p>But rather than the historic architecture, it is the glamorous 20 acre gardens which should promptly attract the attention of any potential buyers - because not only were they believed to have been enjoyed by royalty, they were designed by housing-reformer and co-founder of the National Trust Octavia Hill (1838-1912).</p>

<p>In the 1930s, the enchanting property was home to Alice Bowes-Lyon, a member of aristocracy, who was married to Patrick Bowes-Lyon, the Queen Mother’s paternal uncle, and as such it's believed the royal visited the estate. </p>

<p>She campaigned for the preservation of open spaces, and the membership organisation for heritage conservation arose out of her passionate belief that as a species we need space to breathe. </p>

<p>Elsewhere, it was rumoured that the Queen Mother used to enjoy visiting the gardens and it is also understood that the Oast House was used by the monks for brewing beer, according to the estate agents.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Coach House previously had planning permission to be converted to two four bedroom semi-detached houses - but this planning has now lapsed.</p>

<p>Outside the property is a garage block with two self-contained flats above. The gardens extend to just under 20 acres and feature a pond that is fed directly from the River Darent. </p>

<p>One of the three founders of the National Trust, Octavia Hill was a pioneering thinker and social reformer (1838-1912), according to the charity.</p>

<p>She worked tirelessly to improve urban housing and to protect green spaces in the 19th century, and was also a keen garden designer.</p>

<p>In the 1850s her mother ran a co-operative in Holborn, London, where women who would otherwise be in the workhouse, or in brothels, made toys.</p>

<p>Later, Octavia Hill would persuade social reformer John Ruskin to use part of his inheritance to buy three houses in Marylebone, which she renovated and let at a low rent to poor families rescued from squalor.</p>

<p>Thanks to the careful selection of tenants who were held responsible for cleaning and maintaining properties, she managed to do this profitably but humanely. </p>

<p>She also campaigned for the preservation of open spaces, and in 1895, the National Trust arose out of her passionate belief that as a species we need space to breathe.</p>

<p>For the next 17 years until her death in 1912, Octavia continued to campaign for the preservation of the countryside. </p>

<p>Octavia helped the National Trust to buy and protect its first land and houses and campaigned for the preservation of footpaths to ensure everyone had right of access to the space.</p>
