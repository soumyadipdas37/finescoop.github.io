<p>The text was copied into the caption of the post, which read: 'Hello All! I just wanted to thank you all once again for your constant and loyal support throughout many long and interesting episodes of my life...</p>

<p>'I am only here because of you — and I'm only here for you!!!' the caption continued. 'All thanks and love to you for all, JD'</p>

<p>The post comes as Depp received word Friday from a Virginia court that there will indeed be a delay in the defamation trial he is bringing against ex-wife Amber Heard in the American courts -  but not for the reason he had intended. </p>

<p>Here is he: The actor was seen arriving at the festival on Saturday, opting for a typically quirky look as he donned a Ramones T-shirt and a baker boy style cap with aviator shades</p>

<p>Working hard: The media personality later removed his outerwear to reveal his black shirt as he made an appearance at a talk for the new film</p>

<p>As reported by Deadline, Circuit Court Chief Judge Bruce White has delayed the trial from January 11, 2021 to to May 3, 2021 – due to continued concerns over COVID-19. </p>

<p>Depp had initially filed a motion on August 21 to have the upcoming $50million defamation trial delayed so he could begin filming Fantastic Beasts 3 in London.</p>

<p>The Cry Baby actor filed court documents in a Fairfax County, Virginia court requesting the trial be delayed until anywhere between March and June of 2021, once filming was completed.</p>

<p>His ex Amber, 34, in turn filed a motion opposing the request. </p>

<p>The court had initially set the trial to run from January 11, 2021 to January 28, 2021, though Warner Bros. recently revealed they plan to start filming Fantastic Beasts 3 in October in London, which will run through the end of February.</p>

<p>Moment of gratitude: On Friday, Depp took to his Instagram with a nostalgic-feeling video showing him seated at a desk, penning a letter of gratitude</p>

<p>The text read, in part: 'I just wanted to thank you all once again for your constant and loyal support throughout many long and interesting episodes of my life'</p>

<p>Delayed: Depp had filed a motion to have his upcoming defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard delayed, so he can film Fantastic Beasts 3 in London</p>
