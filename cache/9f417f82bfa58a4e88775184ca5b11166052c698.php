<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>More Australian workers can now apply for a coronavirus payment if they're ordered to self-isolate for 14 days.</p>

<p>New South Wales is the latest state to have the $1,500 pandemic leave disaster payment approved by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.</p>

<p>The lump sum payment is available to eligible workers unable to earn an income because they've been ordered by health authorities to self-isolate for two weeks due to close contact with an infected case - or need to care for a loved one with COVID-19. </p>

<p>The financial relief is available to workers aged 17 and older who don't have access to personal, care or pandemic sick leave.</p>

<p>NSW workers are the latest Australians who could be eligible for a coronavirus payment if they're forced to self-isolated for two weeks and will lose income as a result. Pictured are Sydeysiders in Pitt Street Mall last week</p>

<p>Eligible workers in NSW must show they're been ordered by health authorities to self-isolate or quarantine for 14 days on or since September 17 - and prove a loss of income. </p>

<p>'We didn't want to declare a State of Emergency in NSW, which is what the criteria was to get the pandemic leave,' Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Sunday. </p>

<p>'I wrote to the prime minister saying "please can you support us in that way" and he very gladly accepted.'</p>

<p>'We want to make sure, first and foremost, that those who need to isolate do so.' </p>

<p>Parents caring for a child under the age of 16 with coronavirus or advised to self-isolate for 14 days are also eligible.</p>

<p>For couples, both parties can claim the $1500 payment. </p>

<p>The $1,500 lump sum will be available to workers workers who don't have access to personal, care or pandemic sick leave but are ordered to self-isolate to contacted with an infected case. Pictured is a waitress at Sydney's Opera Bar in Circular Quay</p>

<p>'Our first and foremost priority is to keep the community safe,' Ms Berejiklian added.</p>

<p>'If you have been asked to isolate whether you have been a close contact or whether you have symptoms or for any other reason, please follow those instructions and the government is here to support you.'  </p>

<p>Victoria was the first state to introduce the payment, followed by Tasmania and most recently Western Australia, despite no community transmissions of coronavirus in months. </p>

<p>'If we've learned anything from our counterparts on the east coast, it is complacency is deadly, complacency can bring down the state and will undo all the hard work each and every member of the community has given,' WA Premier Mark McGowan said last week.</p>

<p>'I hope that Western Australians don't have to take-up this payment arrangement however knowing it is available should we need it ensures we are prepared for the worst.' </p>

<p>Other states are also eligible if they request access to the payment.</p>

<p>About $13.3 million in pandemic leave disaster payments have already been paid out to 9,000 Australians since since August 6.</p>

<p>NSW is the fourth state to have the $1,500 pandemic leave disaster payment approved</p>

<p>Just two new COVID-19 cases were recorded in NSW on Sunday, which included a returned traveller in hotel quarantine.</p>

<p>The state recorded its first coronavirus fatality since August 16 when a man in his 70s died at Royal North Shore Hospital on Saturday, bringing the state's death toll to 55.</p>

<p>There are fears NSW case numbers may rise in the coming days after a COVID-19 positive taxi driver worked in Sydney's south-west while potentially infectious for up to nine days between September 8 and 18.</p>

<p>His trips during that time spanned the suburbs of Moorebank, Bankstown, Chipping Norton, Liverpool, Lidcombe, Warwick Farm and Milperra in Sydney's south-west.</p>

<p>Virus-riddled Victoria recorded 14 new cases and five deaths on Sunday, its lowest number of new daily cases in months.</p>

<p>The NSW Premier wanted to ensure those who need to isolate do so can do so without worrying about a loss of income. Pictured is an employee with a customer at Apple's flagship store in Sydney on Friday</p>
