<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Coles appears to have made a glaring maths error in a discount deal that charges customers more if they buy more than one product.</p>

<p>The supermarket put a special onÂ 118g packs of Ritz sandwich crackers salted caramel, and the chocolate flavoured variant.</p>

<p>Usually costing $1.50, they were advertised as 75c each - but also 'any two for $2', which would be more expensive than buying two packs individually.</p>

<p>Coles appears to have made a glaring maths error in a discount deal that charges customers more if they buy more than one product</p>

<p>This mistake was carried forward for larger buys with each pack effectively costing $1 instead of 75c.</p>

<p>Unsuspecting shoppers could easily see the special and stock up, and may not notice they were actually paying for more than they should be.</p>

<p>Screenshots of the mistake circulated on social media and appears not to have been fixed on the Coles website.</p>

<p>Whether the problem would be caught be checkout operators in store is not clear.</p>

<p>'Registers didn't really let you mark prices up only down, so depending on how the automated systems work you may get charged the original price of $1.50 instead of the 'sale' price,' one person speculated.</p>
