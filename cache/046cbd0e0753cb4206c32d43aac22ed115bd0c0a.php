<p>After nearly seven years of marriage, Kelly is now requesting joint legal and physical custody of her son Remington, 4; and daughter River, 6; with the 43-year-old former stepson of Reba McEntire.</p>

<p>However, Clarkson did not request custody of Brandon's two older children - daughter Savannah, 18; and son Seth, 13 - from his first marriage to Melissa Ashworth.</p>

<p>'This next record will probably be the most personal one I've ever released,' the I Dare You songstress said.</p>
