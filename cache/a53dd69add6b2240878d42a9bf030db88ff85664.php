<p>The woman posted in an Australian cleaning group on Facebook, detailing how she filled a spray-top bottle with warm water, then squirted in Fairy 'Ultra Concentrate' which is available from leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.</p>

<p>Taking care not to shake the solution, she spritzed it over the glass and left it to soak for 20 minutes before wiping the surface with a soft, non-scratch sponge.</p>

<p>The post, which has gone viral since it was shared on Sunday, has drawn hundreds of amazed responses with comments including 'fantastic job' , 'outstanding' and 'I want your shower'. </p>

<p>'I have severe shower screen envy,' one woman replied.</p>

<p>The impressive result (left) which has been called 'magic' by many on social media can be achieved with generic dishwashing liquid (right) available in Coles and Woolworths</p>

<p>The technique even received the seal of approval from a professional cleaner, who said she only uses dishwashing liquid diluted with rinse aid and hot water on clients' home surfaces.</p>

<p>Others suggested adding white vinegar to the detergent and water solution for an even brighter, streak-free finish.</p>

<p>It's the latest home cleaning hack involving a Fairy product to sweep social media, following a mother's 'miracle' trick for turning her oven door from grimy to gleaming with a $7.50 dish spray.</p>

<p>An Australian mother used $7.50 Fairy 'Easy Spray' to transform the glass of her oven door from grimy (left) to gleaming (right), without breathing in toxic fumes emitted from chemical cleaners</p>

<p>The woman posted in popular Facebook group 'Mums Who Clean', detailing how she coated her grease-riddled glass with Fairy 'Easy Spray' while the oven was still warm, left it to soak for 10 minutes then wiped it with a soft non-scratch sponge.</p>

<p>Photos prove the stains lifted off easily, leaving the door crystal clear with just a few spritzes of the product that's available in leading supermarkets like Coles and Woolworths.</p>

<p>She said the results left her 'lost for words' and vowed never to waste money on heavy-duty cleaning products again.</p>

<p>The woman said the results of the $7.50 spray (pictured) left her 'lost for words' and vowed never to waste money on other oven cleaning products again</p>

<p>The photos have drawn delighted responses since they were shared on Friday, with comments including 'that's awesome', 'looks amazing' and 'I'm hunting this down tomorrow'.</p>

<p>One woman revealed how she gets more than her money's worth from the spray.</p>

<p>'It's quite expensive, so when my bottle is nearly empty I put in a squirt of dish detergent and a squirt of rinse aid, top it up with water and it seems to work just the same. Cheap refill,' she said.</p>
