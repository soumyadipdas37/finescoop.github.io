<p>The actor, 55, has been open about his grief after his wife passed away aged 53 at their home in California in July last year following a six-year battle with cancer. </p>

<p>In his book, Lost Without You: Loving And Losing Tanya, Vinnie recalled how he witnessed a strange light hovering above his home and said he still struggles to explain it.  </p>

<p>Message: Vinnie Jones has revealed he believes a white light he saw on the night his wife Tanya died may have been a message from her (pictured in November 2019)</p>

<p>He said: 'The night Tans died we were all sitting outside in the back garden... it was around midnight, a still, overcast night, no moonlight.</p>

<p>'One by one, people were heading inside to bed, and I told them I'd be in in a little while. I wanted to smoke and watch the darkness and be alone.</p>

<p>'As I sat there, I noticed above me a white light. I knew it couldn't be a star because of the cloud cover, but there it was – a simple white light above me.'</p>

<p>Vinnie knew that when people lose someone they love they can start to look for signs of them and insisted he 'never believed in any of that stuff'.  </p>

<p>Passing: The actor has been open about his grief after his wife passed away aged 53 at their home in California last year following a six-year battle with cancer (pictured in 2010)</p>

<p>However, he was sure the white light was real and also knew that it was not a star or a helicopter as it was too low.  </p>

<p>He said: 'I don't know why, but in my grief and desperation I said to the light, "Is that you, babe?"</p>

<p>'The light shone above me; it didn't waver, or change. Was it Tans? There was only one way to find out. I thought about all the times she'd say, "Where's my kiss?" and I'd throw her one to catch.</p>

<p>'So that's what I did, right there in that dark ­garden – I threw one last kiss up to the white light above me.</p>

<p>'Suddenly, the light swerved, and dipped, and hovered, and then it flew – zoom! – it flew and swerved and then it disappeared away from me in that garden, and left me, once again alone.' </p>

<p>Vinnie added that he has checked and re-checked the weather forecast for that night since and it was overcast in Los Angeles, with the sun not appearing until midday the following day.   </p>

<p>Vinnie and Tanya met in childhood and tied the knot in 1994, with the actor recently admitting on Piers Morgan's Life Stories that he will never remarry. </p>

<p>When asked whether he could ever face marrying again, Vinnie admitted: 'I think that's a impossible question to answer but if you asked me if I would get married again that would be an impossibility, she wouldn't want that.</p>

<p>'There won't be another marriage Piers I can tell you that. It was the perfect one and done for me.'</p>

<p>He said: 'I don't know why, but in my grief and desperation I said to the light, 'Is that you, babe?' (pictured in 2013) </p>

<p>During his interview with Piers, Vinnie recalled the heartbreaking moment his wife passed away, telling him: 'They said to us maybe days, maybe weeks, maybe months.</p>

<p>‘I was on my knees howling, you find yourself going to Forest Lawn cemetery to make arrangements before she passed. You think you’re in a horror dream, that is the only way to describe it.</p>

<p>'I knew the pain was horrific, I knew it was time to stop and I begged the nurse to stop it.</p>

<p>'All of a sudden she took her last breath and I felt all these butterflies leave her. You’re just not in real time… I felt all these butterflies, Tinkerbell, and she was free. Painless.'</p>

<p>Vinnie discusses his grief in his new book Lost Without You: Loving And Losing Tanya which he hopes will 'inspire others to find the help they need also'. </p>
