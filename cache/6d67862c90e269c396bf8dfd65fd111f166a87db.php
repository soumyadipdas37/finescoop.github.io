<p>'We were planning on catching up, but then when it all got announced he was [doing The Bachelor] there was really no point continuing to chat anymore,' she explained.</p>

<p>'I would never in a million years want to undermine what he is doing on the show and any connections he is making with girls there,' she continued.</p>

<p>'They are all absolutely beautiful and I’m sure some have an amazing connection with him. I would never want to step on any toes.'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I mean sure, have a good old look and appreciate the magic that is the female chass, you’re only human.... but unless home girl is your girlfriend or ya best friend, how about you don’t go and double tap that? It’s not that hard.</p>

<p>'Imagine if the shoe was on the other foot. Their big male egos would throw toys so far out of their prams... we’d never hear the god damn end of it.'</p>

<p>Locky's most recent ex-girlfriend, former Love Island Australia star Jordan Cayless, responded to Angie's rant: 'Couldn't have said it better myself!'</p>
