<p>In short, Eylure Dybrow is an easy way to give your brows an instant at-home refresh, and all it takes is 15 minutes.</p>

<p>'So much easier to use than thought it would be!' one reviewer wrote. 'Great results in nine mins, even covered my stray white hairs. Remains to see how long it lasts, but I was going to the salon every six weeks and spending £15 each time, so it's already a saving!'</p>

<p>Eylure Dybrow tints every last tiny baby hair instantly making my brows look thicker than before. It's affordable and gets the job done. And if you like to tweeze your eyebrows, I advise dying them first as the shape of your brow is more defined after the treatment, so you're less likely to over pluck.</p>

<p>But what does at-home eyebrow tinting involve? Before you go ahead and mix the dye cream and activating solution together, Sara Sordillo, makeup artist for Eylure recommends applying Vaseline around your brow area to avoid staining your skin.</p>

<p>Next, brush the mixed tint through the brows ensuring the hair is completely covered.</p>

<p>'Brush up, down and left to right to ensure each hair is coated,' Sara recommends. 'Start your timer as soon as the first brow is coated. This way you will get a more even result as you will remove tint off the first brow which will account for the time difference.'</p>

<p>Once the dye is applied, it takes just a few minutes to develop before you remove it to reveal freshly darkened eyebrows</p>

<p>She added: 'If you have lighter hair colour and lighter brows and want to keep the colour more natural, shorten the time the tint is on the brows as you can always repeat the steps again to darken but not to lighten.'</p>

<p>Remember to carry out a patch test at least 48 hours before dyeing your eyebrows.</p>

<p>For best results and a natural finish, I recommend applying the dye to the tail of the eyebrow first, working your way through the arch to the front.</p>
