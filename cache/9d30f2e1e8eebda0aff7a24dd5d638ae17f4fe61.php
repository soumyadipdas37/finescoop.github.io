<p>Immeasurable loss: Dr Alex's 20-year-old brother, Llŷr George, tragically passed away in July following a battle with mental health</p>

<p>Last month Dr Alex explained his decision to take break as he thanked fans for their support since Llyr's death. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Time for reflection: Last month Dr Alex explained his decision to take break as he thanked fans for their support since Llyr's death</p>

<p>Fans poured in with their messages of support and encouraged the Love Islander to look after himself. </p>

<p>Shocking: Dr Alex was recently left shocked when a follower took issue with him for being on social media so shortly after Llyr passed away following a battle with mental health</p>

<p>It came after the NHS doctor admitted he was 'hanging on by a thread' after a troll criticised him for being on social media in the wake of his brother's death.  </p>

<p>Last month Alex took a screen grab of the exchange, in which the person responded to his seaside picture with the comment: 'your brother is dead get off social media.'</p>

<p>Sharing his anguish at the response, Alex penned: 'Imagining being this person. I'm holding by a thread and you get people like this.'</p>

<p>Response: In his Instagram story, the medic explained to his fans why he was on social media, as he thanked them for support during this tough time</p>

<p>In his next Instagram story, the medic explained to his fans why he was on social media, as he thanked them for support during this tough time.  </p>

<p>He wrote: 'I am honest and open with you all. The good, the bad and the ugly. There is so much that isn't shared online of course. So many of you are so kind and message me each day with well wishes.'</p>

<p>He concluded: 'I often post to let you know I am still going strong x.'</p>

<p>The doctor also recently shared a Just Giving page that he set up in memory of his late brother, which he posted on his Instagram story in hopes that his followers could donate.</p>

<p>Just an hour after mentioning the fundraiser to raise money for mental health charities, Alex thanked his fans for their immediate contributions: 'Wow, you guys are being so generous. Let's do this!' </p>

<p>Alex confirmed that his brother's funeral took place at the beginning of August. Llŷrwas just weeks away from getting into medical school and following in Alex's footsteps.</p>
