<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New research suggests that a lack of exposure to sunlight does not cause a person to feel more depressed.</p>

<p>A Dutch study, involving 5,282, people found that those participants who already have a tendency to experience negative emotions were the only ones to be affected by the change in sunlight.</p>

<p>The other participants who do not have high neuroticism were almost completely unaffected by the end of the summer sun, The Times reports. </p>

<p>A new Dutch study claims that a lack of sunlight does not influence a person's mood (stock image)</p>

<p>Neuroticism is one of the big five high-order personality traits in the study of psychology.</p>

<p>Those who score highly on neuroticism are more likely to be moody and experience anxiety.</p>

<p>Wim Winthorst, from the University of Groningen, is one of the authors of the study.</p>

<p>He said he was only able to speculate why those participants high in neuroticim provided an exception to the findings.</p>

<p>He said that these people 'might have the tendency to attribute their negative moods to factors beyond their individual control'.</p>

<p>Winthorst also suggested that the winter might act as a stressor for these select participants which causes an increase in depression-related symptoms. </p>

<p>In psychology, stressors can be events or environments which certain individuals might find challenging or threatening to their personal safety.</p>

<p>Speaking to Plos One the researchers said that their findings did not support the belief that seasons can influence moods. </p>

<p>The only people whose mood was affected by a lack of sunlight were those who scored highly in neuroticism - a personality trait that can make a person moody or experience despression-like symptoms (stock image)</p>
