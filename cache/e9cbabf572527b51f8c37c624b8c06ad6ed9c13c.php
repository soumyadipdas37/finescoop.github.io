<p>'Really really unhappy!' Just a couple of hours before sharing her sizzling snaps, Louise revealed during an Instagram Q&amp;A that she was 'really unhappy for 10 years'</p>

<p>London native Louise was encouraged to embark on a healthier lifestyle when she first started dating Ryan in 2016, and has since adopted her own love for fitness.  </p>

<p>Back in April, Louise admitted she's 'working on her relationship' with fiancé Ryan and they still haven't made plans for their wedding.</p>

<p>The star, who got engaged to Ryan in 2018, told MailOnline 'I am just not sure exactly what I want yet' after cancelling her big day last December. </p>

<p>In an exclusive interview Louise said being in isolation with Ryan hasn't been easy and they've agreed to 'try harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'   </p>

<p>Way back when: Having shot to fame on the E4 show in 2011, Louise became part of a central storyline due to her romance with love rat Spencer Matthews</p>

<p>Speaking to MailOnline, she said: 'At the beginning it wasn't that easy but we've had to make a really conscious effort to make some changes.</p>

<p>'We are actively working on our relationship now. For the first couple of years in a relationship you're still in that love phase, there are still new things to experience. </p>

<p>'We've been together for four and a half years now and you do go through phases. You have to try a bit harder and make the effort to appreciate each other.'  </p>

<p>'We are communicating more and having chats about what each other wants, so now we have set some boundaries.'</p>

<p>The pair had booked to marry at London's Kew Gardens in December 2019 but cancelled their plans, with Louise saying: 'It's just the bigger picture for myself and Ryan that we need to get to grips with first.'</p>

<p>Months later, Ryan revealed they had agreed on a venue in Ibiza for their wedding to go ahead in spring 2020 – but now Louise says they're still 'figuring out what it is we want' and their plans have come to a halt.</p>

<p>She said: 'No… actually, we haven't, we are still sort of figuring out what it is we want to do because we're so busy with the business.</p>

<p>'I am someone that really wants to have the best day ever and I want to be in the right space, I am just not sure exactly what I want yet.' </p>

<p>All over: Meanwhile, Louise's younger brother Sam recently parted ways with ex girlfriend Zara after an 18 month relationship, amid claims she cheated on him last year</p>

<p>The Love Island star was reportedly having crisis talks with Sam in a bid to salvage their relationship.  </p>
