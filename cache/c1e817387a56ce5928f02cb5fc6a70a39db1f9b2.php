<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>New York City will begin spraying pesticide to kill West Nile virus-infected mosquitos in Brooklyn and Queens on Thursday. </p>

<p>According to a notice New York City's Department of Health, there has been a recent rise in the number of mosquitoes carrying the life-threatening disease. </p>

<p>So far, no human cases have been reported in the state, but a number of birds, pets and other animals have contracted West Nile after being bitten by a mosquito, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state health department. </p>

<p>The city will spray low-grade pesticide from trucks roving several neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Queens between 8:30pm Thursday evening and 6:00am Friday morning. </p>

<p>Trucks like this one, pictured in Florida, will spray pesticide to kill off the growing number of West Nile virus-infected mosquitoes in Brooklyn and Queens this week (file) </p>

<p>In Brooklyn, spray trucks will be deployed in: parts of Borough Park, Gowanus, Greenwood Heights, Kensington, Park Slope, Prospect Heights, Prospect Lefferts Gardens, and Windsor Terrace.</p>

<p>Pesticide will be sprayed in parts of the  Corona, Flushing, Forest Hills, Kew Gardens Hills, Pomonok, Queensboro Hill, and Rego Park neighborhoods of Queens, weather permitting. </p>

<p>Trucks will spraying a diluted solution of Anvil or DeltaGard, pesticides that kill adult mosquitoes via sumithrin and deltamethrin, respectively. </p>

<p>Both chemicals are used to kill mosquitoes, fleas, ticks and, occasionally, head lice that affect humans. </p>

<p>They are not thought to be particularly dangerous to humans, but some people are more sensitive to the chemicals than others. </p>

<p>Health department officials advise people in the target neighborhoods stay indoors to avoid rashes, eye and nose irritation and exacerbation of respiratory issues like asthma.  </p>

<p>New York was among the first states to be hit by West Nile virus when it was introduced to the US in 1999. </p>

<p>That year, 59 people in the New York area were hospitalized for encephalitis - dangerous brain swelling - West Nile virus, and seven died. </p>

<p>On the wings of countless mosquitoes, the virus swiftly spread across the lower 48 states of the US. </p>

<p>The disease becomes more active when the bugs do - in the summer, peaking in August and September.  </p>

<p>Mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus first came to the US in 1999, and New York City suffered one of the nation's first major outbreaks (file) </p>

<p>So far, no human cases have been reported, but the CDC has detected a growing number of mosquitoes and animals infected with West Nile virus in King's County (Brooklyn) and Queens </p>

<p>Most people who contract the virus don't even know it. They might simply feel a little under the weather for a few days, recover, and move on with their lives none the wiser. Or they might never feel sick at all. </p>

<p>About one in five get mildly ill with a fever. </p>

<p>But for the rare few - about one in 150, according to the CDC - who are harder hit by the virus, it can be quite dangerous, even deadly. </p>

<p>In these cases, the infection first triggers a high fever, headache and neck stiffness. </p>

<p>The involvement o the head and neck are worrying signs that the virus has become 'neuro-invasive,' meaning it is attacking the brain and/or spinal cord. </p>

<p>As a result, people may become disoriented, fall into a stupor or coma and suffer convulsions, tremors or seizures.  </p>

<p>Swelling from the virus's attacks on the brain and spinal cord can damage people's vision and nerves, even leaving them paralyzed. </p>

<p>In rare instances, the infection becomes too much for the nervous system to handle, killing about on in 10 of those who become severely ill from West Nile. </p>

<p>Since the virus arrived in the US, about 2,300 people have died. </p>

<p>This year alone, there have been 63 cases in the US - 26 of which were in California, 9 were in Florida and seven in Texas. Two people have died of the virus this year. </p>

<p>New York City health officials did quantify the increase of West Nile activity found in Queens and Brooklyn, but aim to kill off the infected mosquito population - and in turn their chances of infecting New Yorkers - with this week's pesticide spray. </p>
