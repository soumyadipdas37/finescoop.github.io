<p>Cringe! Pete Wicks, 31, was left cringing as his brutal 2016 fight with Megan McKenna, 27, in Marbella was named 'most confrontational moment,' during the TOWIE's 10th anniversay show</p>

<p>In the throwback clip, a visibly emotional Megan questioned Pete about messaging other girls behind her back, while he feigned innocence.</p>

<p>While watching the scene back, Pete was left with his head in his hands as he cringed over their interaction.  </p>

<p>'Oh my god this is killing me. Turn it off. Turn it off!' begged the long haired lothario as he watched Megan break down in tears over his disloyal actions.</p>

<p>'You've been telling this girl you want to be single - go and be f**king single then,' she said to him, after discovering that he had been in touch with ex-girlfriend Jacqui Ryland. </p>

<p>Megan let rip at Pete in the clip as he attempted to justify his actions by claiming he hadn't cheated on her, but the feisty reality starlet shot back: 'It's worse than cheating!' </p>

<p>'How do you think I feel?' she raged after they had been sat together on a sun lounger, after telling him: 'F**k off and be single then.' </p>

<p>'I've been on the other end of Megan, it's not nice,' admitted Chloe Meadows as the cast watched the X Factor star unleashed her fury on Pete in the clip.  </p>

<p>'I've gotta take the blame for that haven't I?' admitted Pete after watching the heartbreaking scene in full.</p>

<p>Fuming: Megan let rip at Pete as he attempted to justify his actions by claiming he hadn't cheated on her, but the feisty reality starlet shot back: 'It's worse than cheating!'</p>

<p>Second place in the 'most confrontational moment,' category was taken by Lucy Mecklenburgh and her ex Mario Falcone, when he was left covered in red wine at the end of a tense argument. </p>

<p>'If you wanna be a s**g...' blasted Mario after Lucy revealed she knew he'd cheated on her, before swilling him with her drink.</p>

<p>Looking back at the scene, the cast members were shocked by Mario's behaviour and praised Lucy for managing to not get a drop of red on herself during the confrontation. </p>
