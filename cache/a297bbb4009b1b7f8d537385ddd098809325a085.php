<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Reopening the borders to South Australia and the Northern Territory would provide Western Australia with no economic benefit, Premier Mark McGowan has claimed.</p>

<p>With other states and territories beginning to reopen their borders, WA remains isolated in its refusal to subscribe to a targeted COVID-19 'hotspots' regime.</p>

<p>WA's borders have been closed to anyone except designated workers and people exempted on compassionate grounds for almost six months.</p>

<p>The state has not recorded a case of coronavirus in the community for 175 days, but still refuses to open up - even to other safe states such as the NT and SA.</p>

<p>Reopening the borders to South Australia and the Northern Territory would provide Western Australia with no economic benefit, Premier Mark McGowan (pictured) says</p>

<p>Like WA, SA and the NT have managed to stamp out community transmission and have had low coronavirus case numbers for several months.</p>

<p>But Mr McGowan says there is no point in pursuing a travel bubble - as it would only encourage Western Australians to leave the state and bring few tourists in.</p>

<p>'There is no benefit,' he said on Thursday.</p>

<p>'All we'll do is lose jobs were we to open to those [jurisdictions].</p>

<p>'The other states want us to open the border so that West Australian tourists will flood east, not so that people from the east will come here.</p>

<p>'They're only saying all this for very self-interested reasons because we have higher incomes, we have people that are more used to travelling and therefore we'll have more tourists go from Western Australia to the east.'</p>

<p>The comments are likely to frustrate industry groups that have called on the McGowan government to provide certainty on the easing of border restrictions.</p>

<p>Mr McGowan remains adamant the borders won't come down until the eastern states go 28 days with no community spread.</p>

<p>He highlighted reports that passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship may have infected up to 11 people on a flight from Sydney to Perth.</p>

<p>'When we get calls from other governments around Australia, particularly NSW, to bring down our border, all I'd say is they have had significant policy failures in the east that caused the spread of the virus into Western Australia in the early days,' Mr McGowan said.</p>

<p>'We're always very careful about our borders to protect our people. If only they'd been more careful, we would't have had some of those cases come to our state.'</p>

<p>Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist at the University of NSW and an advisor to the World Health Organisation said the measures were 'beyond cautious'.</p>

<p>'I am a very cautious outbreak epidemiologist, and I think that the 28 days is beyond caution,' Professor McLaws told the ABC on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'It's admirable, but it's looking for total eradication, or close to [it]. And I don't that think we can get to that.'</p>

<p>She said a more realistic approach would be using a two-week rolling average of five cases or less. </p>

<p>The premier was speaking at the launch of WA's new container deposit scheme, which he said would create more than 600 local jobs.</p>

<p>He praised mining giant BHP's promise to hire an additional 2500 apprentices and trainees across academies in WA and Queensland.</p>

<p>'Obviously that will be of lasting benefit to the state,' he said.</p>

<p>'We do want to see companies employ more West Australians. If there are shortages in industry, they need to get cracking on getting people into those jobs.'</p>
