<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Sam Allardyce believes West Ham owners David Sullivan and David Gold 'bully' the club's managers into buying players of their choice. </p>

<p>The Hammers boardroom have felt the wrath of the fans already this summer, with a lack of activity in the transfer market following years of wasteful spending, with Sullivan admitting on Wednesday they had bought 'a pile' of players who have flopped.</p>

<p>Now former West Ham boss Allardyce, who was in charge from 2011-2015 and guided the club to promotion, has described the way in which the owners dictate who comes in - but wasn't full of criticism for the pair. </p>

<p>Sam Allardyce managed West Ham for four years and guided them to top-flight promotion</p>

<p>But Allardyce says owners David Sullivan and David Fold bully managers into buying players</p>

<p>'[Sullivan's] a strong man when it comes to signing the players he wants, I know that for a fact,' Allardyce told talkSPORT. </p>

<p>'Sometimes [the owners] will try to bully you into a player they fancy. But you have to stay strong and try to get on with it.</p>

<p>'Sometimes I think his love for football is so great, David Sullivan, he spends the vast majority of his time researching footballers across the world through other sources.</p>

<p>'Sometimes those sources are good, sometimes they're not so good. But at the end of the day it can be a conflict between you and the owner because he wants to make sure when he spends his money he's getting value for money.'</p>

<p>'I think their passion for West Ham, Gold and Sullivan... they get a lot of stick, but they love West Ham.' </p>

<p>Sullivan has warned that West Ham may end the transfer window without any new additions</p>

<p>So far this summer, West Ham have only managed to tie down Tomas Soucek to a permanent deal following his loan spell. </p>

<p>The Hammers have so far failed in their pursuit of Burnley centre back James Tarkowski.</p>

<p>Speaking in an interview on talkSPORT that was not well-received by club insiders or supporters, Sullivan said: 'I cannot say for sure we are going to sign anybody. As each day passes, I get more depressed.</p>

<p>'You can't pay double what you value a player at. We haven't got the money. The club will go bankrupt. These are difficult times and we have to be sensible.</p>

<p>Captain Mark Noble led the outrage after the club sold academy product Grady Diangana</p>

<p>'We have a number of bids in for a number of players, but teams don't want to lose them; key players at decent sized clubs, outside the UK. So whether we get any of these players I do not know.' </p>

<p>Yet the biggest talking point was the decision to sell Grady Diangana to West Brom, which provoked public criticism from club captain Mark Noble. </p>

<p>The club were in turmoil again on Tuesday night, when manager David Moyes along with first-team players Issa Diop and Josh Cullen tested positive for coronavirus, just minutes before their Carabao Cup win against Hull City.  </p>
