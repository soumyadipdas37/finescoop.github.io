<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bertrand Traore is poised to make his Premier League debut for Aston Villa on Monday after making an impressive impact at his new club.</p>

<p>Traore marked his first appearance since his £19million move from Lyon with a spectacular strike to help Villa to a 3-0 win at Bristol City in the Carabao Cup last week.</p>

<p>The former Chelsea forward is likely to become a key part of Villa boss Dean Smith's new-look side with their spending set to pass the £100million mark for the second consecutive summer.</p>

<p>Dean Smith believes Bertrand Traore is ready for his first Premier League start on Monday</p>

<p>The new arrival impressed by scoring on his debut for Aston Villa against Bristol City </p>

<p>Villa boss Dean Smith has been impressed by the talent in his early days since joining the club </p>

<p>Smith said: 'It's not too early [for his first start]. He's trained really well, he looks fit. The French league curtailed early last season but his team were in the Champions League so he's been training pretty regularly.</p>

<p>'His fitness levels are really good and he's certainly made a good start. </p>

<p>'It's only early stages, we've only had one Premier League game and a couple of Carabao Cup games. But we've started well.' </p>

<p>If Traore can replicate his Lyon form Villa could be in for a huge boost to their survival hopes</p>

<p>Villa face Fulham at Craven Cottage on Monday, with the Londoners yet to register a point since returning to the Premier League.  </p>

<p>Smith will be keen to preserve his side's 100 per cent record after beating Sheffield United 1-0 in their 2020-21 opener.  </p>
