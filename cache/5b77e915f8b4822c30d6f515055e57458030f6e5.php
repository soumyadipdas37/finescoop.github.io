<p>They show the ethereal glacial lakes, stunning snow-capped mountains and enchanting forests inside the 2,464-square-mile area in Alberta in all of their hypnotic glory.</p>

<p>They were snapped by Vancouver-based photographer Kai Yhun, who visits Banff National Park several times each year to capture its wanderlust-sparking qualities.</p>

<p>His awe-inspiring pictures show the likes of the serene Lake Louise, the mighty Valley of the Ten Peaks and the breathtaking views from Morant's Curve - a beauty spot where Canadian Pacific Railway trains can be seen snaking through the eye-popping landscape.</p>

<p>Kai, 26, told MailOnline Travel: 'I love Banff, especially the mountains. Each one has such a unique form and I find them very inspiring. My favourite season to visit is in autumn when the climate and the atmosphere are just perfect.</p>

<p>'Visiting Banff is a must for anyone who hasn't been. If you love nature, the hikes are amazing.' Scroll down and prepare to be seduced...</p>

<p>Kai captured this autumnal scene at Moraine Lake, which is watched over by some of the 10,000ft-plus craggy mountains that form the Valley of the Ten Peaks. Moraine Lake is famously photogenic.
