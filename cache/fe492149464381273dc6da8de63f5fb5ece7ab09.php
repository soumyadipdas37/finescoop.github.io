<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Suddenly, it all made sense why Alfie Barbeary was given a private tour of England's team hotel during the Six Nations. The 19-year-old has long been tipped as a star of a future and he marked his first Premiership start with a stunning hat-trick.</p>

<p>Usually a hooker, Barbeary was handed his full debut in the No 6 jersey and he was unstoppable as he scored three tries in 16 minutes. The youngster described it as a 'dream come true', before returning home to his parents with the play-offs firmly in his sights.</p>

<p>'I can't really believe it,' said Barbeary.</p>

<p>Wasps ran riot to condemn Leicester Tigers to their heaviest Premiership defeat at 54-7</p>

<p>Tigers went ahead in the match but were second best throughout in a sorry showing</p>

<p>'I grew up watching Wasps, so to make my Premiership debut in the Ricoh and for it to go so well... I'm really chuffed. It's a dream come true.</p>

<p>'I've been training with Wasps a lot over the summer and I had drips and drabs with them when I was at school. I'm loving it.</p>

<p>'Mum and dad are watching at home and I imagine they are going a bit mental.. I saw them, they sent a photo on the big screen.'</p>

<p>Barbeary's tries sent Leicester crashing to their heaviest ever Premiership defeat. The Tigers scored the opening try through Cameron Henderson, but from thereon in they were hit by a humbling storm of 54 unanswered points.</p>

<p>Cameron Henderson briefly put Tigers ahead early on at the Ricoh Arena in the fifth minute</p>

<p>Malakai Fekitoa crossed over 20 minutes later as Wasps levelled things up with conversion</p>

<p>Jacob Umaga had a strong day from the tee and scored his side's fifth for the bonus point</p>

<p>Wasps scored two first-half tries from the lineout - finished by Malakai Fekitoa and Tom West - and let rip after the break. They were allowed space to attack and ran in try after try.</p>

<p>'Clearly that's not good enough,' said Tigers coach Geordan Murphy. 'I would speculate that every fan is feeling sick, but probably nowhere near as sick us coaching staff feel. It feels like I've been punched in the face quite a few times. It's a bitter pill to swallow.'</p>

<p>Leicester's discipline unravelled, with Ben Youngs and Guy Porter shown second-half yellow cards. Wasps broke tackles and dominated the set piece.</p>

<p>Tom West put his side ahead in the first half as Wasps looked to put Leicester to the sword</p>

<p>19-year-old Alfrie Barbeary was the star of the show as with three tries and an assist</p>

<p>Barbeary sold a dummy to score his first after 47 minutes, before demonstrating his strength to fend his way over for the second. Jacob Umaga was next over the line, and Barbeary handed off two defenders for his third. Only former England winger Lesley Vainikolo has previously scored a hat-trick on his first Premiership start.</p>

<p>Wasps were in free flow, flaunting their skills to secure their eight victory in 10 games since Dai Young was sacked in February. Sam Spink was next before, fittingly, Barbeary turned provider for Zach Kibirigie to complete the rout.</p>
