<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Drew Barrymore has been working very hard on her two children, her acting career, a makeup empire and now a daytime talk show.</p>

<p>So it's no wonder the Charlie's Angels actress feels that she simply does not have time for any men in her life.</p>

<p>The 45-year-old star told Jane Fonda on Wednesday during the Drew Barrymore Show that she has pretty much sworn off the opposite sex.</p>

<p>No time for romance: Drew Barrymore said on her talk show on Wednesday that she has had no romance in the past five years because she cannot open up</p>

<p>Jane, 82, has said recently that she has stopped dating too.</p>

<p>The 9 to 5 star insisted she has 'closed up shop' and is just not interested in romance after marriages to Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden and Ted Turner.</p>

<p>But when Drew said she is not up for romance, Jane shot back: 'You're too young to swear off anything, you have to say open to anything, I am too old so it's very easy to swear off men.'</p>

<p>'Your argument was so good you were talking about your life... is so full,' noted the Wedding Singer star.</p>

<p>Jane won't date either: But when Drew said she is not up for romance, Jane shot back: 'You're too young to swear off anything, you have to say open to anything, I am too old so it's very easy to swear off men'</p>

<p>Jane said: 'Who has time?' </p>

<p>Drew added, 'Yes this is what I am getting at.'</p>

<p>Fonda said Drew could squeeze a little affair in: 'I am all for it!' </p>

<p>Drew said: 'I'm not closed for business. But I have been exactly in that mentality for the past five years, thinking I just don't have the bandwidth, I don't know if I'm willing to open [up,] I just can't fit it in.' </p>

<p>Her last love: The star and Will Kopelman attend the Los Angeles premiere of Blended in 2014</p>

<p>Close couple: Barrymore and Justin Long Grey Gardens premiere in 2009 in NYC</p>

<p>Another love: The former Playboy cover girl in 2006 with musician Fabrizio Moretti</p>

<p>One of her husbands: She was wed to comedian Tom Green for one year, from 2001 until 2002</p>

<p>She was most recently wed to Will Kopelman from 2012 until 2016; they have two daughters - Olive, seven, and Frankie, six.</p>

<p>The Guess model was also married to Tom Green (2001–2002),and Jeremy Thomas (1994–1995).</p>

<p>The ET star has also dated Justin Long, Tom Green, Fabrizio Moretti and Luke Wilson.</p>

<p>Drew's next film is The Stand-In with Lena Dunham and Ellie Kemper. </p>

<p>The day before Reese Witherspoon told Drew she was 'terrified' when she got pregnant at 22.</p>

<p>The Big Little Lie star - who has Ava, 21, and Deacon, 16, with her ex-husband Ryan Phillippe - was just starting out in her acting career when she found out she was expecting her daughter and admits it was a scary time.</p>

<p>She said: 'I got pregnant when I was 22 years old. And I didn't know how to balance work and motherhood. You just do it, you know? I'd made movies but I hadn't, you know, established myself as someone who could demand that it shoot close to my kids' school or, you know, I didn't have any real power, leverage within my industry. I was just like every other mom trying to figure it out - and dad out there, and partner, and grandparent who's raising a child.'</p>

<p>Young mommy: Reese Witherspoon and Children Ava and Deacon attends the Reese Witherspoon Hollywood Walk Of Fame Star Induction Ceremony in 2010</p>

<p>Reese has made a lot of 'sacrifices' for her children, but insists she wouldn't have it any other way because it is 'truly worth it' being a mom.</p>

<p>Speaking on The Drew Barrymore Show, she added: 'You take the food out of your mouth, the clothes off your back, the sleep out of your life. But every bit of it - every bit of that sacrifice is truly worth it because you feel like that's what makes me wake up on a Sunday. It's not movies or my job, it's my kids.'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Reese previously insisted she doesn't 'stress' about juggling her family and career even though it can be 'unpredictable' at times.</p>

<p>She explained: 'It can get chaotic sometimes, but whether you're working a lot or not, life with children will always be a bit unpredictable.</p>

<p>'All mothers have a lot to deal with, and I've been doing it since I was 22 and Ava was born ... They've seen most of my films, and needs to say my daughter loves 'Legally Blonde!' But when I come home, they see me as a mother. They want me to listen to what they've been doing, help them with their homework. It's only their friends who see me as the big movie star.'</p>

<p>Now they are best friends: Ava and Reese seen this year at home; they are 22 years apart</p>
