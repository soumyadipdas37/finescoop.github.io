<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Joe Biden said Sunday that Donald Trump wants Congress to confirm Amy Coney Barrett before Election Day because the president wants a conservative Supreme Court to overturn Obamacare.</p>

<p>'Yesterday, before Justice Ginsburg could be laid to rest and after a hundred thousands of Americans had already cast their ballots, the president nominated a successor to her seat,' Biden said while making remarks regarding the Supreme Court at The Queen Theater in Wilmington, Delaware Sunday.</p>

<p>'It's no mystery about what's happening here,' the Democratic nominee continued. 'President Trump is trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act – he's been trying to do it for the last four years. The Republican Party has been trying to eliminate it for a decade.'</p>

<p>The Affordable Care Act was President Barack Obama's brainchild, and is therefore referred to as Obamacare, and was signed into law in March 2010.</p>

<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said Sunday she is worried Trump is rushing his Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett through the confirmation process because he wants to take down Obamacare at the highest U.S. court.</p>

<p>'What I am concerned about is anyone that President Trump would have appointed was there to undo the Affordable Care Act,' Pelosi told CNN's Jake Tapper. 'That is why he was in such a hurry, so he could have been in place for the oral arguments which begin November 10.' </p>

<p>Joe Biden said Sunday that Donald Trump is looking to get his Supreme Court nominee pushed through before Election Day because he wants a leg up in ditching Obamacare at the highest U.S. court</p>

<p>'It's no mystery about what's happening here,' Biden said during remarks regarding the Supreme Court Sunday. 'President Trump is trying to throw out the Affordable Care Act – he's been trying to do it for the last four years'</p>

<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said Sunday that Donald Trump is 'in a hurry' to confirm his Supreme Court pick so justices can strike down Obamacare</p>

<p>Trump confirm the suspicious on Sunday, touting on Twitter that 'Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court'</p>

<p>The Supreme Court is set to begin oral arguments over a challenge to the Affordable Care Act just days after the presidential election.</p>

<p>After Trump announced Saturday Barrett as the third Supreme Court nominee of his presidency, he touted the federal judge would help clear the way for him to implement a cheaper replacement for Obamacare.</p>

<p>'Obamacare will be replaced with a MUCH better, and FAR cheaper, alternative if it is terminated in the Supreme Court. Would be a big WIN for the USA!' Trump tweeted Sunday morning.  </p>

<p>Barrett will likely face a quick and easy process as Senator Lindsey Graham announced Sunday that the Senate Judiciary Committee will recommend her confirmation to the Senate floor late next month.</p>

<p>The president explained that he chose Barrett because he wanted both a woman nominee and a constitutional textualist to fill the seat left vacant by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.</p>

<p>The most liberal justice on the Supreme Court died last Friday due to complications from pancreatic cancer – leaving a seat open with just over a month to go until the presidential election.</p>

<p>Pelosi also said during her interview with CNN's 'State of the Union' Sunday that Barrett earning a seat on the court would be detrimental to women's health. She was likely referencing concerns that Barrett, a devout Catholic, could contribute another vote to overturning Roe v. Wade.</p>

<p>'It doesn't matter what the process is here. What matters is what it means personally to the American people,' Pelosi said. 'If you have a preexisting medical condition, that benefit will be gone. If you are a woman, we will be back to a time where being a woman is a preexisting medical condition.'</p>

<p>it's up to the Senate to make that judgment and to have those – that process,' the House Speaker continued. 'Whoever he appointed was going to be there to overturn the Affordable Care Act.'</p>

<p>'This is unfortunate that the president would be so disrespectful and rush into this. But, nonetheless, that's what it is,' she said.  </p>

<p>Trump announced Saturday the third Supreme Court nominee of his presidency, Amy Coney Barrett (right), who was joined by her seven children and husband at the White House announcement</p>

<p>Barrett is a Trump-nominated judge on the Chicago-based 7th US Circuit Court of Appeals. She vowed she would 'apply the law as written' as she formally accepted Trump's Supreme Court nomination during brief remarks outside the White House Saturday. </p>

<p>The mother of seven has been hailed by religious conservatives and others on the right as an ideological heir to conservative stalwart Antonin Scalia, the late Supreme Court justice for whom she clerked.</p>

<p>She said Saturday she was 'truly humbled' by the nomination and quickly aligned herself with Scalia's conservative approach to the law, saying his 'judicial philosophy is mine, too.'</p>

<p>'I was lucky enough to clerk for Justice Scalia. And given his incalculable influence on my life, I am very moved to have members of the Scalia family here today, including his dear wife, Maureen. I clerked for Justice Scalia more than 20 years ago, but the lessons I learned still resonate,' Barrett said.</p>

<p>'His judicial philosophy is mine, too. A judge must apply the law as written. Judges are not policymakers, and they must be resolute in setting aside any policy views they might hold,' she added.</p>
