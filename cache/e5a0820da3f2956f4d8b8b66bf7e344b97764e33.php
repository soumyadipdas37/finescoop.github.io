<p>The wheelie bin, coloured purple, means that many households will now have four wheelie bins at home.</p>

<p>More than 7,000 residents across Lincolnshire are already using the scheme via a paper bin or bag, which will be rolled out in more areas over the next few months.   </p>

<p>More residents in Lincolnshire will now get another wheelie bin just for paper and card on top of the bin they use for recycling</p>

<p>Some residents were furious when the scheme was first rolled out last year, according to Lincolnshire Live. </p>

<p>One resident had told the website: 'The new purple bin trial has turned into a fiasco.</p>

<p>'One neighbour received a letter explaining that their bin was rejected due to a piece of paper.</p>

<p>'One of the bins that was accepted had been contaminated with a small cardboard box, this box had been removed from the bin and was on the footpath'.</p>

<p>But Lincolnshire County Council claimed that the trial scheme had been a 'huge success'.</p>

<p>More than 7,000 residents across Lincolnshire are already using the scheme via a paper bin or bag, which will be rolled out in more areas over the next few months </p>

<p>Councillor Eddy Poll said: 'As well as only putting paper and card in a separate bag/bin, residents have done a great job of only putting plastic pots, tubs &amp; trays, glass, tin &amp; cans in their recycling bins – significantly reducing the contamination and increasing recycling rates.</p>

<p>'For us to continue to do the right thing for our communities and for the environment, the right thing to do is extend this to all households in Lincolnshire, over the next few years.</p>

<p>'We will work with residents to make sure they have the right size containers for their home, and in the run up to the roll out, council staff will run engagement sessions and workshops in the community to help residents get the right thing in the right bin.'</p>

<p>Lincolnshire County Council has been approached for comment.  </p>
