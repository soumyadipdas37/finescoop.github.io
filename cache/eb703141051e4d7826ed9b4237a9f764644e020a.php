<p>Norbert Logsdon, 67, has been charged with child abuse after allegedly charging at a girl with a flagpole and hitting her in the face and chest</p>

<p>She said: 'My daughter and I were on our way to grab a bite to eat and passed a rally of Trump supporters on the corner of Blanding Blvd and Loch Rane. </p>

<p>'There was a man shouting and flipping passing cars by, so we reciprocated. Then the man charged at my daughter and I with his flagpole striking my daughter in the face and chest. </p>

<p>'We couldn't believe the look of anger and rage as he attacked my daughter. </p>

<p>'We felt trapped because I couldn't move forward with a car already in front of me. My daughter is still shook up over what happened.' </p>

<p>The violent scenes were captured on video by the girl's mother Crystal Ledoux who was driving past the rally</p>

<p>Logsdon, who has been released on bail, is seen in the video rushing towards the car after Ledoux swore at him.</p>

<p>He then shoves the pole, which had a flag attached bearing the phrase 'Trump 2020 no more bulls***', through the car window. </p>

<p>It reportedly struck the young teenager in the face and chest and a voice can be heard saying 'he just hit me' in the video. </p>

<p>Ledoux noted his license plate and alerted police who tracked down the Trump supporter and arrested him.</p>

<p>She says she has now learned her lesson and will not be driving near political rallies in the future.</p>

<p>She told KBMT: 'I'm not going anywhere near protesters to be honest with you because it scared us so bad someone reacted like that. </p>

<p>'I did see on social media that people are taking this to extremes — as far as the Trump and the Bidens' supporters because that isn't the only incident where I've heard of injuries. </p>

<p>'It's crazy the way the election is turning this year to be honest with you.'</p>
