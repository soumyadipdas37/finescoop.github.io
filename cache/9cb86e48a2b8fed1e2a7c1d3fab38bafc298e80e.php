<p>An Australian professor has warned that turning the clocks forward for half the year can lead to severe health risks that could be amplified during coronavirus. </p>

<p>Professor of Diabetes at Monash University, Paul Zimmet, said daylight saving was a 'major scientific debate' with worrying health implications, 3AW reported. </p>

<p>Australian health professionals have called for daylight saving time to be scrapped after warning that turning the clocks forward sees more heart attacks (file image pictured) reported</p>

<p>Professor of Diabetes at Monash University, Paul Zimmet, said more car and road accidents (car crash in Sydney pictured) occur after the switch to daylight saving time </p>

<p>'In terms of the scientific evidence, which we will want to stick with at the moment, there are more heart attacks just after daylight saving,' Prof Zimmet said.</p>

<p>'More road accidents and then you've got workplace accidents, car accidents and their implications.'</p>

<p>He explained the shift in time also had an impact on bodily functions.   </p>

<p>'There is also cognitive dysfunction in relation to the daylight saving and the change in timing to our normal body rhythms,' Prof Zimmet said .    </p>

<p>He urged the Victorian Health Department to consider the strain that had already been put on the health system and the economy by the coronavirus pandemic. </p>

<p>The professor suggested abolishing daylight saving time to avoid placing Australians in any further danger.     </p>

<p>Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews brushed off the possibility of cancelling daylight saving after being asked about the proposal during his coronavirus briefing on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>The professor warned that daylight saving also prompted more workplace accidents (construction site in Sydney pictured) causing both economic and physical harm </p>

<p>'I don't want to be disrespectful to the professor, who may be a very learned individual. No. Daylight saving will be proceeding,' Mr Andrews said. </p>

<p>Melbourne eased its draconian coronavirus restrictions on Monday with outdoor exercise extended to two hours and the 8pm curfew extended to 9pm.        </p>

<p>'That's why the curfew changes, that extra hour is really important, well ahead of daylight saving,' Mr Andrews explained. </p>

<p>'People will be able to go out and enjoy the city, enjoy the state, enjoy being back at work, enjoy a sense of confidence as they go into 2021.</p>

<p>'This will be a summer like no other and daylight saving, I can confirm, will be a feature of it,' he said. </p>

<p>Victoria recorded 42 new coronavirus cases and eight deaths on Wednesday, taking the state toll to 737 and the national figure to 824. </p>

<p>Residents in NSW, Victoria, the ACT, South Australia and Tasmania will turn their clocks forward an hour at 2am on October 4.   </p>

<p>The debate over daylight saving escalated last year when the European parliament voted to remove the measure from 2021 onwards.  </p>

<p>Countries in the EU will elect to stay on 'permanent summer' or 'permanent winter' time in March next year.  </p>
