<p>Edmund Akkary began sending one of his victims explicit text messages and showed her pornography when she was just 13 years old.</p>

<p>At one point, he bought her McDonald's and tried to grab her breast before paying her $10 so she wouldn't tell her mother.</p>

<p>A Victorian man who sexually abused teenage girls and paid one $10 to keep quiet has been jailed for nearly a decade (stock image)</p>

<p>Akkary later gave the girl $20 and said they would 'do things' together.</p>

<p>The 33-year-old abused four girls, aged from 12 to 16, in regional Victoria between 2014 and 2017.</p>

<p>He was jailed in the County Court on Thursday for nine-and-a-half years.</p>

<p>He earlier pleaded guilty to seven charges, including four counts of an indecent act with or in the presence of a child under 16.</p>

<p>Akkary also admitted sexually penetrating, sexually assaulting and grooming children under 16.</p>

<p>He told one girl she had 'nice boobs' and squeezed her buttocks, but denied it when she complained.</p>

<p>One of the Akkary's victims told the court she felt disgusted, depressed, angry and unable to trust other people.</p>

<p>She said she was exhausted from trying to be strong and hide her hurt behind a smile.</p>

<p>Another suffered nightmares and flashbacks.</p>

<p>Judge Frances Hogan described Akkary's actions as creepy, salacious, abhorrent and offensive.</p>

<p>She said he appeared to have no control over his compulsive, impulsive behaviour.</p>

<p>Akkary has a mild intellectual disability, with an IQ of 73, and can only read to a year five level.</p>

<p>He also has a severe spinal injury and needs a walker.</p>

<p>The court was told he turned to children because he found them non-threatening.</p>

<p>He'd lived a sad and socially isolated life, falling through the cracks of the system after being abandoned by his mother at the age of two.</p>

<p>Despite pleading guilty, Akkary was reluctant to take full responsibility for his abuse and only said it was inappropriate.</p>

<p>He cried as he was ordered to serve five-and-a-half years of his sentence before becoming eligible for parole.</p>
