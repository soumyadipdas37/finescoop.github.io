<p>'As you can see, to ensure the safety of our cast and our phenomenal crew, we've given the ballroom a serious makeover. Even the judges have made some room for social distancing,' said the former America's Next Top Model host.</p>

<p>She then introduced the judges for season 29, which included series regulars Bruno Tonioli and Carrie Ann Inaba and the newly added Derek Hough.  </p>

<p>'And we want to welcome our new judge, six-time mirror ball champion, Derek Hough, announced Tyra, before inquiring about the 35-year-old pro dancer's excitement towards his new gig. </p>

<p>'This is where America first met you, as a dancer, and now you're a judge. What is it like to be on that side of the desk?'</p>

<p>Derek gushed over how much Dancing With The Stars 'means to [him]' and that he is 'so excited to be here.'</p>

<p>Tyra explained to viewers that veteran judge Len Goodman 'wasn't able to safely travel from the U.K. to the United States,' hence why Hough replaced him.      </p>
