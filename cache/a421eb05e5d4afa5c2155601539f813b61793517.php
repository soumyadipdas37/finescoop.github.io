<p>Concerns: Saira Khan revealed her family are worried for her safety during an impassioned chat on Loose Women on Tuesday about new ITV show, Honour</p>

<p>Honour is a two-part series that tells the true story of the murder of a woman who lost her life at the hands of her own family for falling in love with the wrong man. </p>

<p>Speaking about the TV show, Saira told the panel: 'There are girls that look like me, that share my heritage, that need help. They are seen as minority girls and are not represented. I think this is what the drama showed really eloquently.'  </p>

<p>Saira explained: 'This happens because there are societies in this world where men are at the top and their whole purpose is to control women. If a woman wants to live her own life, that is a good excuse to kill her in some societies.'</p>

<p>Scary: The television personality, 50, revealed that 'if a woman wants to live her own life, that is a good excuse to kill her in some societies' (pictured Fisum Burgess as Behya in ITV's Honour)</p>

<p>The TV star said that often women in dangerous positions can't speak out because their families are complicit in the act of honour killing.</p>

<p>In November 2019, Saira posed for a nude photoshoot for a magazine, as she declared she no longer felt 'shame' over her body.</p>

<p>She admitted that she opted to do the naked photo shoot because some of the women in her community would have been killed for doing the same. </p>

<p>Brave: She also said that her decision to strip naked for an OK! magazine shoot was a 'political' one because 'women in my community would be murdered for doing it'</p>

<p>Plot: Honour is a two-part series that tells the true story of the murder of a woman who lost her life at the hands of her own family for falling in love with the wrong man</p>

<p>Saira said: 'I will stand in my underwear and say, you can’t kill me for this reason. I will go out there and wear my bikini. To live their life how they wish to and want to be different, it’s OK. There is no excuse to murder a woman on that basis.'</p>

<p>'I think my family are frightened for me. I do have people looking out for me. When I did that OK magazine shoot, it was a political reason for doing it.</p>

<p>'I didn’t do it to say, oh look how sexy I am. Women in my community would be murdered for doing it. My family are frightened but I would say that I am going to carry on because women are important to me in my community.'</p>

<p>Saira revealed earlier this month that her own mother didn't speak to her for eight months after she took part in the shoot, because she felt she had brought 'shame' on the family.</p>

<p>The mother and daughter reconciled when her 12-year-old son intervened and explained to his grandmother that his mum was trying to help other women </p>
