<p>Safety comes first: The Crown star, 32, nailed off-duty glamour as she teamed her protective face mask with a chic all-black outfit</p>

<p>Effortless style: Highlighting her slender figure, the actress wore a form-fitting turtleneck top and sleek ankle-grazing trousers</p>

<p>Standing tall: The Hobbs &amp; Shaw star added even more pazzazz to her outfit with stilettos and carried her essentials in a simple backpack</p>

<p>All in the details: Square-framed shades, dainty jewellery and a black watch rounded off the Wimbledon native's stylish appearance</p>

<p>Vanessa's new movie The World To Come is set on the American East Coast in the mid-19th century, where two neighbouring couples battle hardship and isolation, and is based upon Jim Shepard's novel of the same name.</p>

<p>The blonde is known to many for her role as young Princess Margaret in the Netflix series The Crown, which she played for the show's first two seasons.</p>

<p>In 2018, the thespian appeared in Mission Impossible: Fallout, and is expected to reprise her role in the upcoming seventh film, which recently resumed filming after being delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Vanessa spoke exclusively to The Daily Mail's Baz Bamigboye about preparing for her upcoming role in Pieces Of A Woman.</p>

<p>The actress plays Martha, a Boston woman who loses her baby during a traumatic home birth, and explained that she spent time with a midwife and a paediatrician at the Whittington Hospital in North London in preparation. </p>

<p>She said: 'I couldn't have acted that, because I've never given birth myself,' she told me. </p>

<p>'Just by pure chance an amazing woman allowed me to watch her give birth. I didn't know her but she was so generous and allowed me to be there when her boy was born.'</p>

<p>Busy bee: Earlier in the day, the blonde opted for a chic black dress as she attended Miu Miu's Women In Talent event at Hotel Excelsior</p>
