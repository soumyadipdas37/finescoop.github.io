<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Bath have been forced to cancel their fan trial event at the Recreation Ground on Tuesday night, where they hoped to host 1,000 supporters for the Gloucester match, after fresh Government advice.</p>

<p>Tuesday night’s Premiership match as well as Bristol’s game next Wednesday against Leicester at Ashton Gate – which was also due to host 1,000 fans – will now both be played behind closed doors.</p>

<p>The last-minute news comes as the Government decided to scrap their plan to allow a small number of fans in grounds, ahead of a wider rolling-out of the return to crowds on October 1.</p>

<p>Bath have been forced to cancel their fan trial event at the Recreation Ground on Tuesday</p>

<p>Bath were only made aware on Tuesday afternoon, hours before the 5.30pm kick-off.</p>

<p>Their fans will be refunded in full, but the club will lose out on key income as well as wasting money on hiring food and drink for the few they assumed were going to be allowed in.</p>

<p>Bath Chief Executive Tarquin McDonald said: ‘We are deeply sorry to share this news, of which we have just been made aware.</p>

<p>The game between Bath and Gloucester will be behind closed doors due to government advice</p>

<p>Bristol Bears' game against Leicester at Ashton Gate will also be played behind closed doors</p>

<p>‘This morning, our understanding was that our fixture was still able to go ahead and having put all of the safety measures in place, we were excited to be welcoming supporters back to the Rec.</p>

<p>‘I would like to take this moment to thank all of our Blue, Black and White faithful, I know how disappointing this news will be for all of you. Public safety has to be our top priority and we will do everything we can to make sure that we can all return to the Rec safely once again in the future.' </p>
