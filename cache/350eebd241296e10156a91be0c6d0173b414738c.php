<p>Slimmed down: Honey said that after struggling to commit to a diet, she decided to overhaul her fitness regime during lockdown after failing to maintain her previous weight loss</p>

<p>She explained: 'Lockdown has proved to me that doing lots of exercise can make you lose weight.</p>

<p>'I went to see a top obesity specialist and a dietician in the past and I was trying to lose weight by changing my diet but during lockdown I combined changing my diet and doing a large amount of exercise.</p>

<p>'I've been probably doing more exercise in lockdown than I have in my whole life.'</p>

<p>Back in 2018, Honey revealed she'd lost a stone in two months after embracing a low-carb diet.</p>

<p>Speaking to The Sun, the rapper admitted she's been desperate to lose weight for a 'really long time,' and has already started to see a difference on her stomach and legs.</p>

<p>'One day hopefully I’ll be able to put a bikini hopefully,' she said. 'At the moment I still don't feel like I can wear a bikini because I’m not confident enough.</p>

<p>'But I still thinner than I was and I feel more confident in my body and when I'm walking around, getting in the pool, getting out of the pool.'</p>

<p>Superstar: She first rose to prominence after competing on The X Factor in 2016, and divided viewers with her unique performance style</p>

<p>Back in 2018, Honey revealed that she decided to ditch her musical persona and pursue a career as an estate agent.</p>

<p>But weeks later, she announced she'd been fired from her new job for being 'too famous.'</p>

<p>She told The Sun: 'They didn’t realise how famous I am... My boss had told me that he was expecting me to give up my music career, which I am obviously not prepared to do.</p>

<p>'Music is my love and passion, and my ambitions are about being a worldwide music artist. I had no intention of being an estate agent long term. I was hoping that a big opportunity for my music career would come in. I do believe I belong on stage.'</p>

<p>Changes: Back in 2018, Honey revealed that she decided to ditch her musical persona and pursue a career as an estate agent, but she was fired weeks later for being 'too famous'</p>
