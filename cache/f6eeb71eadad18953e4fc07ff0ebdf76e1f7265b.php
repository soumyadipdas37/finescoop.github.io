<p>The reason why the vegan formula is so powerful is because of an array of ingredients which work together to lift dead skin cells and unclog pores (Drunk Elephant products pictured)</p>

<p>The reason why the vegan formula is so powerful is because of an array of ingredients which work together to lift dead skin cells, unclog pores, fade pigmentation and smoothe out lines and wrinkles.</p>

<p>These ingredients include AHAs (alpha hydroxy acids) and BHAs (beta hydroxy/salicylic acids), as well as raspberry extract, which nourishes and soothes skin whilst protecting against environmental aggressors. </p>

<p>T.L.C. also has salicylic acid, which exfoliates inside the pore to unclog and remove debris.</p>

<p>It is suitable for all skin tones, including sensitive skin types, and is made without animal products, fragrance, silicone, essential oils, drying alcohols, SLS, chemical and synthetic sunscreen.</p>

<p>The T.L.C. Serum can either be used by itself or in conjunction with other Drunk Elephant products (pictured)</p>

<p>To use the product, senior Mecca retail manager Lucy said you can either use it alone or in conjunction with other skincare products.</p>

<p>'If you have sensitive or easily irritated skin, mix a pump of T.L.C. with a pump of Virgin Marula Oil or B-Hydra serum to dilute the formula and make it more gentle,' Lucy said. </p>

<p>You can steadily build up tolerance to the product by using it on alternate nights, before upping it to every night if your skin can handle it. </p>

<p>An impressive 91 percent of Drunk Elephant users reported that their skin looked more even-toned after use.</p>
