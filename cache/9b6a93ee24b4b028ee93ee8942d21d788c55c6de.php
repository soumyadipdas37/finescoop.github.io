<p>Earlier this year, Sir Trevor said nothing in his career had compared to the 'immense, international' nature of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>Speaking to presenter Julie Etchingham on the ITV News podcast Coronavirus: What You Need To Know, he said: 'I don't remember a story which has so internationally involved us all.</p>

<p>'We are connected much more than we ever thought. We're anxious to hear what's going on all over the world.'</p>

<p>He added: 'It is very, very strange to go through a week knowing that you have so few things which are absolutely planned. It's a bit difficult having all the time on your hands.</p>

<p>'In my personal case, the lack of social contact and having to stay in a lot is at times fairly depressing, really. You just have to try and find ways of dealing with it.</p>

<p>'I must confess I'm not too sure I've done terribly well for finding those ways!'</p>

<p>Sir Trevor was born George McDonald in Trinidad and Tobago in 1939.</p>

<p>His father worked on an oil refinery but also raised pigs as an unusual sideline.</p>

<p>Sir Trevor was one of four children and described their home growing up with cracks they used newspaper to cover over.</p>

<p>He started his journalistic career at the start of the sixties and worked in local papers, radio and television in Trinidad.</p>

<p>It was there he met his first wife Beryl, at a cricket match and the pair went on to tie the knot.</p>

<p>But when he became a producer at the World Service's Caribbean section his life changed forever.</p>

<p>He relocated to London in 1969 to work for BBC radio before switching to ITN in 1973.</p>

<p>The following year he married Beryl and his star rose rapidly as went through roles as news, sports and diplomatic correspondent roles before landing the job of newsreader.</p>

<p>But by 1984 their relationship was on the rocks and they divorced.</p>

<p>Then following an office romance an ITN production assistant called Josephine, they got married in 1985.</p>

<p>His lighthearted 'And finally' stories at the end of the ITN's News At Ten bulletins became a national institution. </p>

<p>He was knighted in 1999 and still presents specials on ITV.</p>

<p>In 2007 he said he could quit his ITN job by the end of the year because of the strain of late-night working hours and the toll it takes on his family life.</p>

<p>And he admitted ‘binge-drinking’ with a bottle of wine every night before bedtime and a Dom Perignon champagne breakfast every Sunday</p>
