<p>Researchers from King's College London examined data on 1,004 babies as part of a wider study into food tolerances and how they develop.</p>

<p>Half those studied were breastfed exclusively until six months, the other half were fed foods often linked to known allergies later in life.</p>

<p>Allergy-related foods given to the infants in the early weening group included gluten, sesame, wheat, eggs, cod fish and cow's milk. </p>

<p>The team found by aged three, seven of the children in the breastmilk only group had coeliac disease compared to none in the group given wheat. </p>

<p>Experts warned that more studies were needed before changes are made to national advice on weaning - which is the NHS recommends should start at six months.  </p>

<p>For the study, the babies who were given wheat were fed 0.14 ounces of wheat protein every week from four months of age in the form of two Weetabix</p>

<p>The research, called the Enquiring About Tolerance (EAT) Study, was published in the journal JAMA Paediatrics and involved a team of US and UK researchers. </p>

<p>Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease in which eating gluten - found bread, pasta and cereals - causes the body's immune system to attack its own tissues.</p>

<p>Common symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, wind, constipation and indigestion and sufferers must exclude gluten from their diet. </p>

<p>For the EAT study, the babies who were given wheat were fed 0.14 ounces of wheat protein every week from four months of age in the form of two Weetabix. </p>

<p>The entire group were tested for anti-transglutaminase antibodies - an indicator of coeliac disease - at three years of age.</p>

<p>Those with raised antibody levels were referred for further testing by a specialist.</p>

<p>Lead author Gideon Lack, professor of paediatric allergy at King's College London said this study provides evidence introducing significant amounts of wheat to a baby under six months could prevent the development of coeliac disease. </p>

<p>"This strategy may also have implications for other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes,' the expert explained.</p>

<p>Author Dr Kirsty Logan, researcher in paediatric allergy at King's College London, said the early introduction of gluten should be explored further.</p>

<p>Future studies could make use of the results of the EAT Study as the basis for larger clinical trials to definitively answer this question.</p>

<p>Dr Baptiste Leurent from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, not involved in the study, said differences in coeliac rates could be down to chance.</p>

<p>'Typically, a result that has more than 5 per cent chance to have happened by chance alone is not considered sufficient evidence – here we are just below this threshold, at 2 per cent,' Leurent explained. </p>

<p>Half those studied were breastfed exclusively until six months, the other half were fed foods often linked to known allergies later in life. Stock image</p>

<p>'In other words, even if food introduction had no effect, there was around a 2 per cent chance for these seven children to end up in the same group.'</p>

<p>He agreed with the study authors in saying that the subject should be examined in more detail as there could be other explanations behind the different rates.</p>

<p>For example, although less likely, the difference could have been due to other allergenic ingredients introduced early such as milk or peanuts.</p>

<p>“Other studies have found an effect toward the other direction, and is it is therefore too early to suggest any change in the baby’s diet to the public,' he said.</p>

<p>'However, it is an interesting finding, which definitely needs further exploration, as the study authors acknowledge.”</p>

<p>The findings have been published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. </p>

<p>Coeliac disease is a genetic autoimmune disorder in which gluten leads to damage in the small intestine.</p>

<p>Gluten provokes inflammation in the small intestine which affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients from food. </p>

<p>The condition is estimated to affect one in 100 people worldwide. </p>

<p>One percent - or three million Americans - are living with coeliac disease.</p>

<p>There are more than 200 symptoms of coeliac disease but the more common ones are:</p>

<p>Abdominal bloating and pain</p>

<p>Chronic diarrhea</p>

<p>Vomiting</p>

<p>Constipation</p>

<p>Pale, foul-smelling, or fatty stool</p>

<p>Weight loss</p>

<p>Fatigue </p>

<p>The only treatment for the disease and is a strict gluten-free diet. </p>

<p>Only foods and beverages with a gluten content less than 20 parts per million are allowed.</p>
