<p>The first lady's trip, which was to visit a Concord hospital, involved neither the presidential campaign nor the coronavirus pandemic that has killed nearly 200,000 Americans.</p>

<p>She was there to visit a neonatal program for babies born addicted to drugs. Combating addiction is one of the three pillars of her Be Best campaign.</p>

<p>Melania Trump has been focused on her signature initiative in recent days - she hosted an addiction roundtable at the White House earlier this month and led an event on sickle cell disease on Monday.</p>

<p>Her New Hampshire journey marked her first solo trip outside of Washington D.C. since the coronavirus pandemic began.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the presidential contest in New Hampshire is close between President Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden.</p>

<p>A Sienna/New York Times poll out earlier this month had Biden in the lead by three points in a state that could prove critical to deciding who wins the White House this November.</p>

<p>Notably absent from any mention was the first lady.</p>

<p>The Trump children, however, have been busy on the campaign trail.</p>

<p>Ivanka Trump surprised volunteers at the Latinos for Trump headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on Wednesday, where she also volunteered to work the phone bank.</p>

<p>After her visit, she sat down with Republican Gov. Doug Ducey and others to participate in a roundtable discussion about America's working families.</p>

<p>Earlier this week in Wilmington, North Carolina, she spoke of her father's accomplishments, including the First Step Act which removed a 'three strikes' life sentence for some offenses and allowing judges more discretion when it comes to the sentencing of non-violent crimes.</p>

<p>'Of all the people who've talked about positively impacting the system for better, it was this president who delivered the most historic criminal justice reform that we've had in a generation and it's just getting started,' Ivanka said. </p>

<p>Her siblings have also stayed busy campaigning. </p>
