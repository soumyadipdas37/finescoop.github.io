<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Noel Gallagher has revealed he's refusing to sport face masks, despite UK's restrictions to minimise the spread of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Wearing a covering over your nose and mouth is mandatory by law in all shops, supermarkets and on public transport, with exemptions for people with medical conditions and children under 11.</p>

<p>During a new interview on The Matt Morgan podcast, the musician, 53, explained: 'Listen to me, it's not a law. There's too many f***** liberties being taken away from us now.'</p>

<p>Going against the law: Noel Gallagher has revealed he's refusing to sport face masks, despite UK's restrictions to minimise the spread of coronavirus (pictured in February)</p>

<p>The Oasis star recalled a time he requested to speak to a shop manager when an employee asked him to don a protective mask.</p>

<p>'I don't give a f**k. I choose not to wear one and if I get the virus it's on me, it's not on anyone else. If every other c***s wearing a mask I'm not gonna catch it off them, and If I've got it then they're not gonna catch it off me. I think it's a p***take', he said.</p>

<p>Last month, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that repeatedly refusing to wear a face mask could lead to a fine of up to £3,200.</p>

<p>At present those who do not cover their faces can be ordered to pay a penalty of £100 – or £50 if they pay within a fortnight. </p>

<p>People caught without a mask for a second time will now face a fine of £200, with the amount doubling on every repeat offence to a maximum of £3,200. </p>

<p>The rock star went on to reflect on another moment he refused to wear mask, explaining: 'I was going up to Manchester the other week and some guy's going 'can you put your mask on, because the transport police will get on and fine you a thousand pounds. But you don't have to put it on if you're eating.'</p>

<p>'So I was saying 'Oh right, this killer virus that's sweeping through the train is gonna come and attack me but see me having a sandwich and go leave him, he's having his lunch?''</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, his estranged brother Liam shared his thoughts on the topic as he tweeted: 'Don't like but it's gotta be done think it's a crime to hide this face.' (sic)</p>

<p>In a bid to curb the virus further, Boris introduced the 'six person rule' on Monday, meaning no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work or 'exceptional life events'. </p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. </p>

<p>In June, singer Liam, 47, revealed he postponed his wedding because he doesn't want to shield his face while saying his vows.</p>

<p>The rocker was due to marry his long-time girlfriend Debbie Gwyther in Italy over the summer.</p>

<p>He insisted in March that their big day would still be going ahead even when the country was in full lockdown.</p>

<p>Speaking to Zoe Ball on BBC Radio 2, he said: 'It's been put back now until next year because I think we had to wear masks and stuff and I am not getting married with a mask on.'</p>

<p>The Wall Of Glass hitmaker proposed to Debbie whilst on holiday on the Amalfi Coast in August 2019 </p>
