<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>It may have been an underwhelming season opener for Real Madrid, but Los Blancos' goalless draw with Real Sociedad won't be forgotten in a long time for Marvin Park, as the youngster made his Madrid debut.</p>

<p>The 20-year-old academy product came off the bench to replace Rodrygo with 20 minutes remaining as Zinedine Zidane's side looked to break the deadlock at the Reale Seguros Stadium.</p>

<p>Park's senior appearance caps a remarkable journey in which the Spanish youngster came through the ranks of a number of clubs before finding a home at Real Madrid, including Tranmere Rovers.</p>

<p>Former Tranmere Rovers academy player Marvin Park (R) has made his debut for Real Madrid</p>

<p>The 20-year-old Spaniard was introduced by Zinedine Zidane with 20 minutes remaining</p>

<p>The midfielder joined Rovers' youth academy as a nine year old in 2009, and spent three years in the North West before returning to Spain and playing for Ciutat de Palma. </p>

<p>He then went onto develop at La Salle and Jonquet Penya Arrabal before Madrid snapped up the youngster in 2016, and Park has flourished at Los Blancos ever since. </p>

<p>Park was unable to break the deadlock as Madrid drew 0-0 with Real Sociedad on Sunday</p>

<p>Park, who has represented Spain at U19 level, was born in Spain to a Nigerian father and South Korean mother, and barring his stint in England with Tranmere, has spent his life in Spain. </p>

<p>The 20-year-old was unable to make the difference for Zidane's side, though, with Madrid's title defence getting off to a steady start with a point at Sociedad. </p>

<p>Los Blancos had a mixed 2019-20 campaign, winning LaLiga ahead of arch rivals Barcelona, but they crashed out of the Champions League to Manchester City in the Round of 16. </p>
