<p>F1 legend Michael recorded an unprecedented 91 Grand Prix victories during his 17-year career, but that could be equalled by Mercedes driver Hamilton at this weekend's Russian GP. </p>

<p>And F2 title leader Mick claims his father always claimed his records were there to be beaten while praising Hamilton's 'positive run'. </p>

<p>Mick Schumacher has hailed Lewis Hamilton ahead of his potential milestone this weekend</p>

<p>F1 legend Michael Schumacher recorded a record 91 victories during his 17-year career</p>

<p>'One sentence my dad always used to say was records are there to be broken,' the 21-year-old told Sky Sports.</p>

<p>'It's everybody's aim in the sport to do that. I think Lewis had a very, very good run - he had a very consecutive and positive run.'</p>

<p>A victory for Hamilton would also move him one step closer to emulating the German legend's seven world championship titles. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mick is already in the process of following in his father's footsteps as a member of the Ferrari Junior Academy, and is a strong contender for a seat on the F1 2021 grid thanks to an impressive championship-contending campaign in F2.</p>

<p>But while hailing Hamilton's influence on the sport, Mick insists his aim will be to break the Brit's record if he makes the step up to F1. </p>

<p>But that record could be equalled by Mercedes driver Hamilton at the Russian Grand Prix</p>

<p>And Michael son Mick Schumacher said his father believed his records were there to be broken</p>

<p>'Records are there to be broken and obviously from our side, I think we see it on a good side, too,' Schumacher added. </p>

<p>'It's good for the sport. He's been very influential in this sport too.</p>

<p>'The next aim would be then I guess for me, if I do make the step [to F1], to break that.'</p>

<p>Mick's comments come a few days after renowned neurosurgeon Erich Riederer claimed his legendary father is likely to be in a vegetative state and there is little chance of him ever making a full recovery.</p>

<p>The German suffered devastating brain injuries in a skiing accident back in 2013 while on holiday in the French Alps and his condition has been closely guarded by his family.</p>

<p>Schumacher is set to follow in his father's footsteps as a member of the Ferrari Junior Academy</p>
