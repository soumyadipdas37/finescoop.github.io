<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A witness who saw police fire at an outlaw motorcycle gang associate who yelled 'go on, shoot me' has told a court his death was 'unnecessary'.  </p>

<p>Liam Scorsese was shot dead by police in February 2018 after refusing to surrender a knife taken from the Brisbane family home of his girlfriend Chireez Beytell. </p>

<p>Jogger Chris Pennifold, who was 50 metres from the shooting, said he did not see a weapon in Mr Scorsese's hand or the victim lunge toward police, an inquest into his death heard on Wednesday.</p>

<p>'In my honest opinion, this was an absolutely unnecessary shooting, police officers were not under immediate threat,' Mr Pennifold told the court.</p>

<p>Critically, a body-worn camera failed to activate and did not capture the crucial moments of the shooting, the inquest was told</p>

<p>'He did not appear to be an immediate threat to life at all.' </p>

<p>A body-worn camera failed to activate and did not capture the crucial moments of the shooting, the inquest was told.</p>

<p>After Mr Scorsese was shot, a constable and a neighbour, who was a nurse, applied first aid until paramedics arrived and took him to hospital.</p>

<p>He died an hour later and an autopsy found the cause of death to be gunshot wounds to his chest and neck.</p>

<p>The inquest heard Mr Scorsese arrived at Ms Beytell's family home in Wakerley to speak with her on the Sunday morning he was shot.</p>

<p>The inquest heard they began to fight before she went back inside and locked the door, causing Mr Scorsese to fly into an uncontrolled rage. </p>

<p>Ms Beytell's mother Madelene Erasmus sobbed hysterically as she recalled Mr Scorsese 'became a different person' after he was locked out of their home after a loud confrontation with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>'His face was so angry - at that moment it was a completely different Liam,' Mrs Erasmus told the hearing.</p>

<p>After Mr Scorsese (right) was shot, a constable and a neighbour, who was a nurse, applied first aid until paramedics arrived and took him to hospital</p>

<p>'I closed the front door, Liam was screaming harder and harder, and I locked the security door.</p>

<p>'Liam was banging on the door, he wanted her to come out. I told him "you need to leave". I called my husband and then Liam started kicking the security doors - he was very, very angry.'</p>

<p>The family barricaded themselves inside and called police to force Mr Scorsese to leave.</p>

<p>'If they (the police) want to come, they can come,' Mr Scorsese reportedly told the family before stripping off his shirt and waiting on the mailbox.</p>

<p>Police arrived at the home moments later and shots rang out.</p>

<p>Detective Sergeant Dylan Brook who investigated the fatal shooting said Mr Scorsese was armed with a knife as he walked toward police.</p>

<p>The officers warned Mr Scorsese to drop the weapon and get on the ground, only for him to increase his pace. </p>

<p>Mr Scorsese was hit in the chest with a Taser, but the 31-year-old ripped the wires from his body and continued to close in on police.</p>

<p>In fear for his life and the life his partner, a constable fired two shots bringing Mr Scorsese to the ground as he dropped the knife.</p>

<p>'His actions were authorised, justified and legally defensible,' Sgt Brook told the court.</p>

<p>'Using the Taser first showed [the constable's] reluctance to use lethal force against Mr Scorsese and it showed restraint on his behalf, particularly when faced with someone armed with an edged weapon or a knife.</p>

<p>'He definitely attempted to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the incident.' </p>

<p>The inquest was told Mr Scorsese had struggled with drug abuse and mental health issues in the months before the shooting and told family he had been hearing voices.</p>

<p>Coroner Terry Ryan will explore whether the police response was justified and their use of body cameras a unit failed to work.</p>

<p>He will also examine whether adequate mental health support was available to Mr Scorsese.</p>
