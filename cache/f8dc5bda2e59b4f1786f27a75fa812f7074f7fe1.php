<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Australian politicians are putting pressure on Rio Tinto to appoint someone from the country as its next chief executive, after the destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal site sparked a major backlash.</p>

<p>Jean-Sebastien Jacques was forced to quit last week following a backlash after the mining group blew up ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia, earlier this year.</p>

<p>The French-born British citizen, 48, will step down at the end of March next year, or when a replacement is found – whichever is earlier.</p>

<p>Rio Tinto boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques was forced to quit last week following a backlash after the miner blew up ancient caves in Pilbara, Western Australia (pictuerd), earlier this year</p>

<p>But Australia's treasury is pushing for Rio to appoint an Australian to lead the Anglo-Australian firm.</p>

<p>Although its corporate headquarters is based in London, the mining group generates the bulk of its earnings in Australia, which has vast iron ore deposits. </p>

<p>Australia's treasury minister Josh Frydenberg said: 'Rio Tinto is one of the great companies of the world with a proud Australian history.</p>

<p>'With the vast majority of its revenue coming from Australia, it is fitting to once again see an Australian as chief executive along with the majority of the board.'</p>

<p>Frydenberg added that he had a 'constructive conversation' about the matter with Rio's chairman Simon Thompson.</p>

<p>The Australian government is pressing to tighten foreign investment rules and protect strategic industries amid concerns over souring relations with China and the impact of Covid-19.</p>

<p>But Rio has also come under pressure from Australian politicians for having too little appreciation of the cultural heritage of the iron-ore rich region of Pilbara, where it generates 90 per cent of its revenues.</p>

<p>Jacques told a parliamentary inquiry into the Juukan Gorge blasts that he was not aware of the cultural significance of the rock shelters until they were blown up on May 24.</p>

<p>Ben Wyatt, treasurer of the Western Australian state government, told Australian media: 'There's no one on that board with any real understanding of the Aboriginal groups who own the country on which they operate. </p>

<p>'That to me screams risk, and it's something I am stunned hasn't been picked up over the years.'</p>

<p>Potential Australian candidates are understood to include Anglo-American boss Mark Cutifani, and Sandeep Biswas, boss of Newcrest Mining.</p>
