<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Exeter boss Rob Baxter called on his two great Scots to propel the Chiefs into the last four of the Champions Cup.</p>

<p>Stuart Hogg, 28 and Jonny Gray, 26, both start Saturday's quarter-final against Northampton Saints.</p>

<p>While he usually signs rough diamonds to polish up rather than established Test stars, Baxter said he signed the pair for days like this.</p>

<p>Exeter boss Rob Baxter has called on Jonny Gray (L) and Stuart Hogg (R) for their quarter-final</p>

<p>Baxter said he signed the experienced Scotland internationals for occasions such as this</p>

<p>‘I was really pleased at how little money Stuart and Jonny wanted to come on,’ said Baxter. ‘I’m hoping to describe them as bargain basement British Lions next year!</p>

<p>‘No, if we go outside our model we work hard on how they’ll fit in. They currently look like they are. These are the games those guys have been targeted for.</p>

<p>‘Things have gone well for us so far. We’ve got to hope that every time there is added strength to the squad, not only does it improve us because of their qualities, it also improves other players.</p>

<p>‘Jonny is yet to play for us in Europe, but everything we’ve seen so far is very good. He comes up with set-piece plays around the line-out with that extra bit of size, height and ball-playing ability. His work-rate is tremendous.</p>

<p>‘You’ll often see he’s the first person to react to something that changes in the game. He’s the guy that doesn’t stop and assess for a long time. Mentally he can move on very quickly.’</p>

<p>Hogg and Gray were signed outside of Chiefs usual model but bring valuable experience</p>

<p>Saints are in dire straits in the league with just one win in seven games since the restart.</p>

<p>Tomorrow they could struggle in the scrum after an injury crisis has left them with inexperienced Emmanuel Iyogun, 19, and on-loan Alex Seville, 22, who only joined from Gloucester this week, as loosehead props.</p>

<p>Exeter, though, are fully loaded and expected to win heavily with bookmakers predicting a 20-point win. But Baxter is wary of Saints — and of complacency.</p>

<p>‘I am expecting a full-on, season-defining game for them,’ he added. ‘I would like to think the magnitude of the game will help us. We haven’t gone beyond this stage before and I’d like to think we’d have an ability to focus on ourselves.</p>

<p>‘As important as all the other fixtures are, we should be aiming for our best performance of the season.’ </p>
