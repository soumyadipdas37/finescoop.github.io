<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Two deadly Boeing 737 Max crashes were the ‘horrific culmination’ of engineering, mismanagement and oversight lapses that allowed the company to hide flaws, a report says.</p>

<p>Congressional investigators in the US said 346 lives were lost because of ‘repeated and serious failures’ by Boeing and air safety regulators.</p>

<p>They were told the chief project engineer approved a critical design change to software despite being unaware of the key details and a test pilot’s warning that a failure would be ‘catastrophic’.</p>

<p>US congressional investigators in the US said two deadly crashes involving Boeing's 737 Max airline were a result of 'repeated and serious failures' by Boeing and air safety regulators</p>

<p>The Transportation Committee report stemmed from an 18-month probe into the 2018 crash of a Lion Air flight in Indonesia and of Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 in 2019. </p>

<p>The Max was grounded worldwide shortly after the Ethiopia crash.</p>

<p>It said: ‘The crashes were the horrific culmination of a series of faulty technical assumptions by Boeing’s engineers, a lack of transparency on the part of management, and grossly insufficient oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration.’</p>

<p>Failings included pressure to rush the Max out to compete with an Airbus plane and a ‘culture of concealment’, it said.</p>

<p>In both crashes software repeatedly pointed the nose down, forcing pilots into unsuccessful struggles to keep planes up.</p>
