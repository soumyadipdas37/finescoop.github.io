<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>DUP's Sammy Wilson has been branded a 'disgrace' after a photograph emerged of the MP not wearing a face mask on the London underground.</p>

<p>Fury erupted on social media after Mr Wilson was pictured reading a magazine without a face covering as he travelled from Westminster to Heathrow on Thursday.</p>

<p>A witness claimed the MP, 67, had not worn a mask for the entire duration of the trip, despite those who do not cover their faces on London transport risking £200 fines. </p>

<p>Critics took to social media to question the politician after the image emerged this week, with one branding Mr Wilson a 'disgrace' and asking: 'Rules not apply to MPs?' </p>

<p>He added: 'Sammy Wilson MP on tube in London this morning with no mask after a £200 fine announced earlier this week. Disgrace.'  </p>

<p>Another condemned what he claimed was 'highly irresponsible behaviour' from the East Antrim MP, adding: 'I hope that he will reconsider his actions and show some respect for other people on the tube in the future.'  </p>

<p>DUP's Sammy Wilson has been branded a 'disgrace' after a photograph emerged of the MP not wearing a face mask on the London underground</p>

<p>Fury erupted on social media after Mr Wilson was pictured reading a magazine without a face covering as he travelled from Westminster to Heathrow on Thursday</p>

<p>North Down MP Stephen Farry tweeted: 'Most NI MPs do acknowledge, understand and respect rules re facemasks' on public transport. </p>

<p>Mr Wilson has since accepted he 'should have' had a mask on, while complaining the UK has 'become like East Germany under the Stasi where members of the public think it is acceptable to act as snoops.'</p>

<p>The MP, who previously described face coverings as 'muzzles', went on to ask why the person who took the photograph had not approached him on the train.</p>

<p>He also claimed he had only taken the mask off briefly to make a call, the Belfast Telegraph reported.</p>

<p>'Whoever took the picture didn't approach me or say anything to me which I suppose would have been the proper way to behave,' he added. </p>

<p>It comes as new data revealed less than 0.1 per cent of people who are stopped by police for not wearing masks on trains have received a fine. </p>

<p>Speaking about the photograph of Mr Wilson at a Stormont Executive press conference, DUP leader Arlene Foster said everyone is 'equally subject to the law'</p>

<p>British Transport Police said it stopped 14,726 people from 15 July to 15 August for failing to comply, with 14 fixed penalty notices issued, the BBC reported.  </p>

<p>From July 30 to September 8, authorities recorded 50,729 'interventions' with passengers not wearing masks. Some 3,545 were told to leave the train.</p>

<p>Rules introduced in June require anyone travelling on public transport to wear a face covering, but BTP said fines would only be issues as a 'last resort.'  </p>

<p>Speaking about the photograph of Mr Wilson at a Stormont Executive press conference, DUP leader Arlene Foster said everyone is 'equally subject to the law'.     </p>

<p>'I want to say this as clearly as I can, everyone is subject to the law, everyone is equally subject to the law and equal under the law,' she said.</p>

<p>'So it is important that we remember that, and that is the position of the DUP.'</p>

<p>She added on Thursday that she had not had the opportunity to speak to Mr Wilson about the matter yet.</p>

<p>'Everybody has to abide by the law and take the consequences as well as not abiding by those laws,' she said. </p>

<p>Those caught not wearing a mask on public transport in London can face a £200 fine, which doubles each time a person is caught, up to £6,400.</p>

<p>There are exemptions for the rule on the basis of age, health and disability reasons.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, Conservative MP Danny Kruger apologised after being spotted without a mask during a public transport journey in London.</p>

<p>Mr Kruger, David Cameron's former speechwriter, said in a statement: 'I boarded an almost empty carriage at Hungerford and quite simply forgot to put on my mask.</p>

<p>'When I got to Paddington I realised my mistake and covered up for the rest of my journey.</p>

<p>'If the person had reminded me rather than taking a photo and posting it on social media I would of course have put on my mask then and there.</p>

<p>'I do apologise for my mistake.'</p>

<p>Mr Wilson has previously been outspoken about the wearing of face coverings.</p>

<p>In July he tweeted a photograph of himself in an ice cream shop in Co Antrim not wearing a mask, with the message 'you can't eat ice cream when you're muzzled!'</p>

<p>Face coverings in indoor places became compulsory in Northern Ireland on August 10.  </p>
