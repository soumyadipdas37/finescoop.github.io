<p>New laws will allow the taxman to demand the information from banks with no need to ask a court or the taxpayer they are chasing. </p>

<p>The new laws in the Finance Bill are designed to help HMRC tackle tax evasion. But the banking industry has warned they risk 'watering down' protections for taxpayers. </p>

<p>Changes: New laws will allow the taxman to demand the information from banks with no need to ask a court or the taxpayer they are chasing</p>

<p>UK Finance said the authorities were looking for an 'easy fix' to speed up tax investigations by cutting out the courts. </p>

<p>The trade body said: 'We are concerned that HMRC, in removing independent oversight and appeal rights from the process, are simply inclining toward a convenient and easy fix to their timing issues, at the expense of a marginally harder path of fixing the current process, which has appropriate and necessary safeguards.' </p>

<p>A spokesman for HMRC insisted the new rules contain safeguards for taxpayers. They said the new process was more in line with tax powers in other G20 nations. </p>

<p>'The power can only be used in specific circumstances where the information is reasonably required for the purposes of checking a taxpayer's tax position. It cannot be used to collect debts,' the spokesman said.</p>
