<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A lorry driver has been jailed for 12 years after police found £1.25 million worth of heroin stashed inside a crisps delivery.</p>

<p>Dariusz Urban, 49 (pictured), was driving a lorry where Border Force officers found  25kg of heroin with a six-figure street value hidden in cover load of crisps </p>

<p>Dariusz Urban, 49, was intercepted as he drove a lorry into Harwich International Port, Essex.  </p>

<p>Border Force officers found 25kg of heroin with the six-figure street value hidden in a cover load of crisps.</p>

<p>Mr Urban, of Ostrzeszow, western Poland, admitted attempting to import Class A drugs and was sentenced at Chelmsford Crown Court on Thursday. </p>

<p>When searching the lorry, the officers discovered 50 packets of drugs hidden inside two ramps in the vehicle.</p>

<p>The lorry had arrived into Harwich having travelled from Poland, via the Netherlands. </p>

<p>His arrest came after a military-grade encrypted communication system used by organised criminals was hacked by law enforcement.</p>

<p>EncroChat was an encrypted platform where users could speak privately between specially-designed handsets, thought to be used exclusively for criminal purposes.</p>

<p>There were thought to be 60,000 EncroChat users internationally, including 10,000 in the UK, with prices at £1,500 for a six-month contract.  </p>

<p>Because of the information found through the hack, the National Crime Agency (NCA) was able to tip off Border Force. </p>

<p>When searching the lorry, the officers discovered 50 packets of drugs hidden inside two ramps in the vehicle (pictured)</p>

<p>They were waiting for Mr Urban at the Essex port on April 15 this year.</p>

<p>He was found with an EncroChat phone and was one of hundreds of arrests made as part of a UK-wide probe known as Operation Venetic.</p>

<p>After the NCA publicised the arrest, an international drug supplier shared a screenshot of the story on EncroChat, asking the suspected UK recipient of the drugs: 'This you?'</p>

<p>The supplier has since been arrested by Dutch authorities in the Netherlands. </p>

<p>NCA deputy director Matt Horne, who is the gold commander on Operation Venetic, said: 'Dariusz Urban's sentencing is another example of the impact the NCA, Border Force and UK policing are having on serious organised crime.</p>

<p>'Like many other cases, with this operation we were able to plot how the drugs would be picked up and moved and when would be best to strike.</p>

<p>'There is much more to come.'</p>
