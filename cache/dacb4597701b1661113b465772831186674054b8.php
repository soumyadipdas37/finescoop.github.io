<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mum has revealed how she transformed her 'small boring block' in her backyard into a beautiful entertainment area for guests - and she did the whole thing for just $7,500.</p>

<p>Australian woman Amie Mejia said she had been quoted between $11,500 and $12,000 by a carpenter to sort her outside area, but knew she didn't want to spend that much.</p>

<p>Instead, Amie and her partner took the project into their own hands and they laid the deck together, furnishing it with budget items from Kmart and The Reject Shop.</p>

<p>In total, Amie said she and her partner saved 'at least $5,000' by doing it themselves, and she wouldn't change it for the world.</p>

<p>'Our backyard makeover!' Amie posted on Facebook, alongside photos of her deck before and afterwards.</p>

<p>'Amazing what you can do with a small block. A very boring space transformed into a lovely entertainment area.' </p>

<p>To carry out the project, the Australian mum said she and her partner first bought all of the materials from Bunnings for around $3,500. </p>

<p>Then, they dug up as much soil and grass around the base as possible to avoid any moisture sitting on the timber. </p>

<p>AFTER: Amie furnished the area with lights and a pallet for her lights and plants from The Reject Shop; she bought other budget decorations from Kmart and Bunnings (pictured after)</p>

<p>'We had a carpenter lay the foundation, which cost $4,000, and then my husband laid the deck so no labour cost,' Amie wrote.</p>

<p>'It took him about 20 hours across two weeks after work and was a bit of a backbreaking job.'</p>

<p>She added: 'But it was worth it, as all our quotes were around $11,500-$12,000 - so we saved about $5,000.'</p>

<p>AFTER: 'It was worth the blood, sweat and tears, as all our quotes were around $11,500-$12,000 - so we saved about $5,000,' Amie said (pictured after)</p>

<p>Once the decking was done, it was just about decoration.</p>

<p>For this, Amie said she bought some wall pallets from The Reject Shop to decorate the area, as well as some fairy lights from the discount store.</p>

<p>She added furniture and plants from Bunnings and Kmart, and said their family love spending time in their new outdoor area now.</p>

<p>AFTER: 'This looks amazing and I'm definitely saving it as inspo for our new build,' one homeowner posted of the transformation (pictured after)</p>

<p>Thousands who saw the budget outdoor transformation on Facebook said they loved it and would love to try something similar.</p>

<p>'This looks amazing and I'm definitely saving it as inspo for our new build,' one homeowner posted.</p>

<p>'Wow, what a cracker job, you should be proud,' another added.</p>

<p>Others said they had been inspired to transform their own home's outdoor area after seeing Amie's home.</p>
