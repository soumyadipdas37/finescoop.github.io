<p>A 26-year-old student nurse has left the internet in stitches after sharing photos of her one-year-old French bulldog Stanlee, who won't stop watching her while she works in the next room.</p>

<p>Alicia Lalor, from Sydney, said Stanlee is 'so needy' and 'such a stage five clinger' that he likes to be close to her at all times, which can make it difficult when she is trying to complete nursing assignments.</p>

<p>'I asked Stanlee to sit in the other room so I could complete my assignment,' Alicia posted on Facebook this week.</p>

<p>'That didn't stop him from staring at me the entire time.'</p>

<p>This is partly because he spends so much time with her.  </p>

<p>'I take him with me to work every day and when I'm studying he's always with me, so he's become very used to me being around,' she said. </p>
