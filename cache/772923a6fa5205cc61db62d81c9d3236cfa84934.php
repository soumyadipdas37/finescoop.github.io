<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Army wives have caused a spike in coronavirus cases at Britain's top tank base after inviting a therapist from virus-hit Preston for an illegal botox party.</p>

<p>The group, who joked they were the 'covid queens' on Instagram, invited the beauty therapist to the married quarters in Bovington Garrison, Dorset, four weeks ago.</p>

<p>Five wives later tested positive - forcing another 12 women and 30 soldiers into isolation for 14 days. </p>

<p>One resident told The Sun: 'These women crossed a line and it has raised eyebrows in the village.</p>

<p>'The wives were advised not to do it, but they went ahead anyway and they really made a party of it.'</p>

<p>The resident confirmed there had only been five confirmed covid cases in the local area - and all were women who'd been to the botox party.</p>

<p>Camp commanders were said to have been furious once they found out, but could do nothing to punish the women. </p>

<p>Some 30 troopers were ordered to take compulsory Covid tests and self-isolate after coming into contact with the women.</p>

<p>And a Spar in Wool was forced to close because one of the women had visited it. </p>

<p>The company said: 'We temporarily closed the store in order to execute a professional contractor deep clean as a precautionary measure.'</p>

<p>The therapist – a registered doctor – is thought to have dodged the local lockdown rules by travelling 250 miles to the base. She and the 30 soldiers all tested negative.</p>

<p>An Army spokesman said: 'We can confirm a small number of individuals tested positive for Covid-19 in Bovington Garrison four weeks ago.' </p>

<p>They said there had been no further positive cases.  </p>

<p>Sam Crowe, head of Public Health at Dorset Council, said: 'We were made aware of a number of cases at Bovington camp who were identified through military and NHS test and trace services.' </p>

<p>The therapist, from Preston, should have been isolating at home after the city was put into lockdown on August 8.</p>

<p>All residents were banned from mixing with any other households indoors or in a garden in a last-ditch attempt to curb soaring rates of coronavirus.</p>

<p>They were also be urged to avoid meeting with friends in any setting, such as pubs and restaurants. </p>
