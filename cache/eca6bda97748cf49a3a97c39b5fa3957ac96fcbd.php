<p>So long! Selena Gomez has said goodbye to a small house she lived in many years ago. On Tuesday the Los Angeles Times reported the Rare singer sold her small cottage in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles for $2.37M after listing the property in 2018</p>

<p>Brave and beautiful: The Texas native showed off a scar on her thigh this month after having a kidney transplant due to complications from Lupus, an autoimmune disease that causes harm to organs and tissues</p>

<p>The one-story home is from the 1950s and has a cozy feel to it with a nearly symmetrical facade.</p>

<p>There are also columns over the entrance way that has a portico and a chandelier. A green front door has window panes and on both sides are multiple windows.</p>

<p>The front has large concrete rectangles surrounded by grass which leads to a small garden with boxwood plants and mature trees as well as iceberg roses.</p>

<p>Lounge zone: Inside there is an airy feeling with high ceilings and recessed lighting as well as windows on the ceiling line. The floors are made of washed brick lending an Old World feel and there are white columns on the sides of the entrance way to the living room</p>
