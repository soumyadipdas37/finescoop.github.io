<p>The Manchester United striker and Phil Foden, who had both earned their first senior England call-ups, were kicked out of the squad by Gareth Southgate following their misdemeanors.</p>

<p>And Greenwood has now broken his silence after Foden apologised on Monday. </p>

<p>Man United's Mason Greenwood has apologised after being axed from the England squad</p>

<p>Greenwood said: 'Having now had the chance to reflect on what's happened, I can only apologise to everyone for the embarrassment I have caused.</p>

<p>'It was irresponsible of me to break the COVID-19 protocols which are in place to protect players, staff and the public. In particular, I want to apologise to Gareth Southgate, for letting him down, when he had shown great trust in me.'</p>

<p>'Playing for England was one of the proudest moments in my life and I only have myself to blame for this huge mistake. I promise my family, the fans, Manchester United and England that this is a lesson I will learn from.' </p>

<p>Greenwood and Foden were at the centre of the England scandal after breaching coronavirus protocols during their stay in Iceland with Southgate's squad. </p>

<p>The young duo were photographed in the hotel room by the girls who stopped by to visit them</p>

<p>One of the women was videoed while on the phone to Foden and Greenwood, making plans</p>

<p>The FA are currently investigating the pair after they sneaked in two Icelandic girls, one a beauty queen, into their team hotel, breaking both Icelandic law and the FA's social distancing guidelines with people outside their bubble. </p>

<p>Having just made their England debuts, they were sent home ahead of the Three Lions' Nations League game against Denmark on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Icelandic police have now fined the duo 250,000 Icelandic Krona (£1,300) for the rule breach during the coronavirus pandemic, which must be paid by the individuals themselves and not by the FA or their clubs. </p>

<p>More to follow... </p>

<p>Foden has since released a statement, in which he apologised to England, City and his family</p>
