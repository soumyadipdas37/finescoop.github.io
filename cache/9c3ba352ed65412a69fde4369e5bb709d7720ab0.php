<p>Samantha Stone's mum gave her a sponge replicating the crash site where she wrote off her new Mini days before her 21st</p>

<p>'The lights went out and in front of everyone she brought it out while everyone was singing happy birthday. </p>

<p>'I was like ''Oh my god'' then I just burst into laughter. She's such a comedian.</p>

<p>'The worst part is my grandad who bought me the car knew nothing about it. He was just happy that I was ok.' </p>

<p>Samantha, of Nottingham, bruised her knee in the crash when the car skidded off the road and hit a tree.</p>

<p>She added: 'I didn't realise what it was at first but as soon as I realised what she had done I nearly died.</p>

<p>'He just put his head in his hands and asked me what it was about, so I had to explain to him that I crashed it.'</p>

<p>Samantha, said: 'It was really funny and it brought everything into perspective, I was really upset about the car but we've all had a laugh about it and it's a birthday cake I will never forget.'</p>
