<p>And EastEnders star Adam Woodyatt has revealed the pitfalls of filming with Perspex screens on set.</p>

<p>According to the man behind Walford's Ian Beale, 52, it has not been plain sailing as they resume filming.</p>

<p>Back on: Adam Woodyatt who plays Ian Beale in EastEnders revealed to Radio Times that he has struggled to adapt to the new safety measures on set due to the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>The BBC One soap is returning, after lockdown forced it to go into hiatus, thanks to the use of screens, body doubles and CGI to film moments of 'intimacy'. </p>

<p>Adam shared his struggles with Radio Times Magazine: 'Some days it works really well. Other times, it's been a pain.</p>

<p>'If rain gets on the Perspex, you can't shoot through it and you can only wipe it dry with a certain type of cloth. And when we're inside, we're getting reflections.</p>

<p>'Until everything gets back to normal, if it ever does, this is the way we have to do things.</p>

<p>'But it's honestly taking forever. I could fall asleep between takes.'</p>

<p>His co-star, Letitia Dean, who plays Albert Square's Sharon Watts, has adapted to the new safety measures. </p>

<p>The 52-year old said: 'You can't move for that two-metre stick and sanitiser!</p>

<p>Slo mo: The soap star, 52, revealed that it now takes 'forever' between filming takes as he admitted that sometimes the safety measures 'work' well and 'other times, it's a real pain'</p>

<p>'Filming with the screens took some getting used to, but we've been using them now for two months, so it's becoming second nature.</p>

<p>'And I don't mind the slower pace. If it means we can keep making television, then that's great.'</p>

<p>The BBC soap drama, which is back on September 7, also brought in the real-life partners of the cast to shoot kissing scenes.</p>

<p>Executive producer Jon Sen said he wanted EastEnders to return with 'all the kissing and fighting that they expect to see.'</p>

<p>Letitia Dean (pictured right) said: 'Filming with the screens took some getting used to, but we've been using them now for two months, so it's becoming second nature'</p>

<p>The 45-year old was asked about returning with a Talking Heads-style monologue during lockdown, a format adopted by radio soap, The Archers.</p>

<p>He added: 'People were saying to me, "Can't we do a Jean Slater monologue in her kitchen?"</p>

<p>'But I didn't want to compromise on our storytelling and bring EastEnders back in a less ambitious form.</p>

<p>Executive EastEnders producer Jon Sen believes that despite the current challenges of filming, the production team have shown more 'ingenuity and ambition' then he ever thought possible</p>

<p>'We've shown that, with ingenuity and ambition, you can achieve far more than you ever thought you could.</p>

<p>Jon feels the relatable stories of the Eastenders characters are needed during the current climate. </p>

<p>He added: 'People like to pick holes in EastEnders when it's on, but once it goes missing from the schedule, fans feel a sense of vacuum and also that need to see contemporary stories being told on a regular basis.</p>

<p>'Continuing drama that reflects the cultural landscape is really important.'</p>
