<p>The 46-year-old beauty has starred on the cover three times during her career - in 1996, 1997 and 2019 - and Tyra was especially pleased to see the impact of her latest shoot for the magazine.</p>

<p>'I was on it, again, last year,' began the supermodel turned TV host. 'And for the first time in the history of the Sports Illustrated having a website - not Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition website, the Sports Illustrated website - it crashed.'</p>

<p>Happy with this: Tyra Banks feels 'proud' that her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue shoot managed to crash the magazine's website she told NPR this weekend</p>

<p>Crash call: 'I was on it, again, last year,' began the supermodel turned TV host. 'And for the first time in the history of the Sports Illustrated having a website - not Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition website, the Sports Illustrated website - it crashed'</p>

<p>Speaking to NPR, Tyra added: 'I'm proud of that.'</p>

<p>Tyra has recently replaced Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews as the new host of 'Dancing with the Stars', and the model has confessed she's looking forward to the challenge.</p>

<p>The TV star also admitted she's nervous about 'stepping into [their] shoes' on the series.</p>

<p>She explained: 'I think the challenge is stepping into shoes. I mean, you know, Tom Bergeron and Erin. They lead the show, this is one of the top-rated shows in the world. So [I'm] respecting the stage that they have set and then adding my icing to that.</p>

<p>Her other covers: The 46-year-old beauty has starred on the cover three times during her career - in 1996, 1997 and 2019 - and Tyra was especially pleased to see the impact of her latest shoot for the magazine</p>

<p>'I feel confident about that, but of course, it's a challenge, but I don't back away from challenges.'</p>

<p>And although she's hoping the live shows go off without a hitch, Tyra admitted she isn't too worried about making mistakes.</p>

<p>She said: 'I love when something wrong happens because the world can see, like, the imperfection. I always say, 'Show the mishaps and the malfunctions and the mistakes.''</p>

<p>New job: Banks will host season 29 of Dancing With The Stars</p>

<p>Last week Tyra said to UsWeekly: 'My goal is for a 12-year-old to be sitting on the couch with their parents and grandparents and everybody can relate personally to what they see on that screen.</p>

<p>'That's a hint. Not giving up the goods. You'll have to tune in!' </p>

<p>Tyra has been dating 45-year-old Canadian businessman Louis Bélanger-Martin since August 2018.</p>

<p>They were seen getting ice cream together last week in LA </p>

<p>In August she seemed to have on a diamond ring in photos obtained by DailyMail.com. DailMail.com has reached out to Tyra's reps for confirmation of her relationship status.  </p>

<p>The businessman shares a 12-year-old son with his ex-wife Valérie Martin Scraire, while Tyra has a three-year-old son named York with her ex, Norwegian photographer Erik Asla.  </p>

<p>Hard shoes to fill: The TV star also admitted she's nervous about 'stepping into [their] shoes' on the series. She explained: 'I think the challenge is stepping into shoes. I mean, you know, Tom Bergeron and Erin. They lead the show, this is one of the top-rated shows in the world. So [I'm] respecting the stage that they have set and then adding my icing to that'</p>
