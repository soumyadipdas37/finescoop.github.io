<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump met with evangelical leaders at Trump Tower shortly after his election and, after they departed, allegedly told his 'fixer' Michael Cohen: 'Can you believe people believe that bulls***?'</p>

<p>Cohen's new book, Disloyal, out on Tuesday, described the encounter.</p>

<p>Evangelical voters were seen as key to Trump's victory, marshaled to a large extent by Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, a famously devout evangelical.</p>

<p>About one in four American adults belong to an evangelical denomination, according to research by the Brookings Institute. </p>

<p>Trump was keen to court them, and yet, according to Cohen, was deeply disparaging behind their backs.</p>

<p>In the weeks he spent as president-elect, Trump met a series of people at Trump Tower</p>

<p>Among the people Trump met were evangelicals, who he allegedly mocked once they left</p>

<p>After a prayer meeting, when evangelical leaders laid their hands on him, Trump allegedly said: 'Can you believe that bulls<strong><em>? Can you believe people believe that bulls</em></strong>?'</p>

<p>Cohen writes, in excerpts of his book obtained by the Washington Post: 'The cosmic joke was that Trump convinced a vast swathe of working-class white folks in the Midwest that he cared about their well-being. </p>

<p>'The truth was that he couldn't care less.'</p>

<p>Trump's three marriages, alleged infidelities, previous pro-choice comments and dubious business deals were all glossed over during the election - to startling effect.</p>

<p>The 2016 National Election Pool Exit Survey had Trump leading Hillary Clinton among white evangelicals by 79 per cent to 16 per cent, Brookings reports.</p>

<p>Pence, the most influential evangelical in U.S. politics, has not commented on Cohen's claims.</p>

<p>But the White House has been quick to condemn the series of allegations in Cohen's book.</p>

<p>Cohen, who worked for Trump from 2006-18, paints Trump as racist, sexist and enamored of Vladimir Putin. </p>

<p>Among Cohen's claims was that Trump said the only reason why Barack Obama had been admitted to Columbia University for undergrad and then Harvard Law School was because of 'f**king affirmative action.'</p>

<p>Cohen also wrote that Trump's 'low opinion of all black folks' included him allegedly saying: 'Tell me one country run by a black person that isn't a s<strong>thole. They are all complete f</strong>king toilets.'  </p>

<p>Cohen's memoir is out on Tuesday</p>

<p>He claims that Trump mocked Nelson Mandela after his death in 2013, writing that Trump didn't think Mandela 'was a real leader — not the kind he respected'.</p>

<p>Cohen claimed that Trump said 'Mandela f<strong>ked the whole country up. Now it's a s</strong>thole. F**k Mandela. He was no leader.'  </p>

<p>Cohen also detailed his payments made to buy the silence of porn star Stormy Daniels.  </p>

<p>The White House hit back at Cohen - who is currently serving out a three-year federal prison sentence for tax evasion, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations - in a statement on Saturday. </p>

<p>In a statement to the Washington Post, press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said:  'Michael Cohen is a disgraced felon and disbarred lawyer, who lied to Congress. </p>

<p>'He has lost all credibility, and it's unsurprising to see his latest attempt to profit off of lies.' </p>

<p>Another White House spokesperson told AP that the memoir amounted to 'fan fiction'.</p>

<p>Cohen 'readily admits to lying routinely but expects people to believe him now so that he can make money from book sales,' White House spokesman Brian Morgenstern said. </p>

<p>'It's unfortunate that the media is exploiting this sad and desperate man to attack President Trump.' </p>
