<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tottenham manager Jose Mourinho has told chairman Daniel Levy to begin negotiations over Manchester United forward Jesse Lingard, according to reports.</p>

<p>Academy product Lingard has made just two substitute appearances in the Premier League since February and was not named in United's squad as they lost 3-1 to Crystal Palace in their season opener on Saturday.</p>

<p>Lingard scored 13 goals in 48 matches under Mourinho during his best campaign for United in the 2017/18 season.</p>

<p>The forward is thought to have been unsettled by his lack of first-team opportunities at United</p>

<p>He went on to reach the 2018 World Cup semi-finals with England but has scored only five Premier League goals since then.</p>

<p>Discussions between intermediaries have begun after Mourinho urged Levy to make enquiries, ESPN says. </p>

<p>Russian champions Zenit St Petersburg will reportedly rival Spurs for his signature, although Mourinho may need to move midfielder Dele Alli on in order to sign the 27-year-old.</p>

<p>27-year-old Lingard has been at United for 20 years and has scored a total of 33 goals for them</p>

<p>Tottenham have brought in Gareth Bale and Sergio Reguilon from Real Madrid and are looking to add more firepower to support Harry Kane and Son Heung-min.</p>

<p>Kane and Son scored 42 of the club's 81 goals last season but misfired in the lacklustre 1-0 opening day defeat to Everton at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium last Sunday.</p>

<p>Lingard has scored 33 goals in 207 appearances for United and four goals in 24 senior international matches.</p>

<p>He has not been named in an England squad since being left out of the Euro 2020 qualifiers last October. </p>
