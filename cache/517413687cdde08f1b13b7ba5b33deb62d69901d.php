<p>Private functions, such as weddings, with a maximum cap of 150 people can now stand while drinking and dancing.</p>

<p>The South Australian Government confirmed on Thursday that restrictions will be eased, allowing 'vertical consumption' of alcohol and dancing in licensed premises.</p>

<p>Guests and revellers were required to be seated at all times at private functions under previous restrictions. </p>

<p>The state's hospitality industry is keen for the lifting of measures that prevent people from drinking while standing in pubs, restaurants, and other venues.</p>

<p>The fitness industry has also asked for fans to be allowed in gyms ahead of warming weather in coming months.</p>

<p>Both groups believe the changes would not present undue risks to the community.</p>

<p>South Australia reported no new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday and has no active infections.</p>

<p>The state has had only 40 cases in the past five months.</p>
