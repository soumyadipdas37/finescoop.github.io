<p>The 82-year-old Oscar-winning actress, along with her castmates Lily Tomlin, Martin Sheen and Brooklyn Decker, all had to stop work on the final season of the series in March when the COVID-19 pandemic began to sweep across the globe and halt productions everywhere.</p>

<p>Fonda has since gained some weight while isolating at home, but she will make sure that she is back to her best shape when the cameras start rolling again.</p>

<p>Activist and more: Jane Fonda intends to lose 10 pounds before she returns to filming on the seventh season her hit Netflix show Grace And Frankie; seen here in 2018</p>

<p>In an interview with The New York Times, she said: 'There was a time when I was anorexic, but I never got below 112 (pounds). I don't let it get too far out of hand.</p>

<p>'I'm not at my fighting weight right now. I'm 127. My fighting weight is about 119. So, you know, when we get three weeks out from shooting Grace and Frankie, I'll lose 10 pounds.'</p>

<p>The Coming Home star was one of the pioneers of home workouts in the 1980s, and her keep-fit videos and books sold by the millions across the world.</p>

<p>Now, Jane – whose screen credits go all the way back to her debut as the lead in 1960's Tall Story – stays in great shape with a personal trainer and by following a healthy diet.</p>

<p>At the start of this year, the Klute actress continued her graceful aging process by deciding to go grey and stop dying her hair blonde.</p>

<p>When Fonda revealed her desire for a more natural look, she said the producers on Grace And Frankie supported her decision.</p>

<p>'I went grey at just the right moment. I didn't know COVID was coming along. I got tired of the chemicals and the time and the money to keep myself this particular color of blonde, you know – enough already! </p>

<p>'And so I talked to the producers of Grace And Frankie and I said, "I want to go grey, but that would mean that Grace is going to have to go grey," and they were all for it,' she continued. </p>

<p>The two-time Oscar winner also recently discussed an even more personal point – her relationship with her eldest daughter Vanessa Vadim, which she said has been strengthened by her recent political activism.</p>

<p>Hit show: Grace And Frankie has had a successful run with a seventh season still in production; the series has been nominated for a Golden Globe as well as several Primetime Emmy Awards</p>

<p>Jane revealed that her climate change campaign arrests over the past year have brought her closer to her daughter Vanessa, 51.</p>

<p>Fonda, who had her daughter with first husband Roger Vadim, suffered from post-natal depression after the birth of Vanessa.</p>

<p>In 2018's HBO documentary Jane Fonda in Five Acts, the actress admitted that the pair never bonded, and that she was very much focused on her career at the time.</p>

<p>But now, Jane was happy to say that the mother-daughter pair have finally reconciled in the wake of her activism.</p>

<p>According to Jane, Vanessa was waiting for her when she was released after a night in jail after being arrested during one of her weekly Fire Drill Friday protests in Washington DC.</p>

<p>Asked if this has resulted in a permanent reconciliation, Jane told The Times newspaper: 'Yes, it has.</p>

<p>'It was something that we could share. It was something we could do together and she's very good when we find ourselves in a corner,' the On Golden Pond star continued.</p>

<p>'When I came out of jail I didn't know she was going to be there and we just looked at each other and burst into tears.'</p>

<p>Fonda was arrested five time for civil disobedience during her four months of protest rallies last fall, and she found the experience empowering and 'transformative': </p>

<p>Outspoken: Fonda was arrested five time for civil disobedience during her four months of protest rallies last fall, and she found the experience 'transformative'; seen here in 2015</p>

<p>'There's so few opportunities these days to put our whole bodies in alignment with our deepest values.</p>

<p>'I mean, it's counterintuitive because actually when you get arrested you're out of control,' Jane said.</p>

<p>'You're totally in the control of the police and I might add that when you're white and famous they treat you differently than they would if I was black or of color, but in spite of the loss of control there's a feeling of empowerment.</p>

<p>Author: Fonda's new book about her recent experiences, What Can I Do?: My Path from Climate Despair to Action, will be published on September 8th</p>

<p>'It wasn't just me. All the people I talked to who joined me in the civil disobedience commented on the same thing. It really was transformative.'</p>

<p>And the octogenarian Hollywood legend doesn't care if her arrests have changed people's opinion of her.</p>

<p>'Honey, at my age it doesn't matter. I've been there. I've done that. I've survived. They're all dead or in jail and I'm still going. You know, I don't care.</p>

<p>'There's nothing they can do to me any more that they haven't already tried to do, and I'm at the end of my life...' she added.</p>

<p>'I think older women tend to get braver. It's also a matter of hormones.'</p>
