<p>Fearne wore her pink locks up in a messy bun and showcased a selection of jewellery including a necklace with her daughter's name on.</p>

<p>She wrote in the caption of the image: 'This is 39. Last nights make up on. Hair breaking free. The only one up in the house. I probably won't change but I'm always expanding and improving. 39.</p>

<p>'I won't let anyone dim my light, I will keep dying my hair pink, I will dress as I always have, I will keep loving with my whole heart, I'll send over the top texts to people I adore, I'll keep letting go and learning.</p>

<p>'I'll say 'I love you' 'I'm sorry' 'thank you' 'F**k it', I'll keep trying, I'll keep trying to not try so hard, I'll keep being me. This is 39.'</p>
