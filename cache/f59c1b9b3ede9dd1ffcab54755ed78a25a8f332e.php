<p>Radio hosts Fitzy and Wippa struggled to contain their emotions on Friday as they told Steve, a listener whose wife died of breast cancer on Mother's Day this year, that the Chandelier star was giving the father-of-two $20,000 to help pay his bills. </p>

<p>Steve's daughter had asked the radio hosts to help her dad get back on his feet after Sia pledged $100, 000 to Nova FM to be given out to deserving recipients amid the coronavirus pandemic, last month. </p>

<p>Sweet charity: She's known for her generosity, and on Friday, Sia helped out a 60-year-old man who had lost his wife, job and home, all in the short space of a few months. Pictured at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards in Los Angeles in March 201</p>

<p>'We've heard about your story, 2020 to say the least for a lot of people has been a shocker, and yours in particular,' Wippa, 40, told Steve via FaceTime on Friday.</p>

<p>Despite falling on hard times, Steve said his main concern was for his two daughters, and 'making sure they're okay and get through this'.  </p>

<p>Fitzy, 43, then told Steve that the show had decided to help out by giving him $10,000 to help pay his bills. </p>

<p>Getting upset: Radio hosts Ryan 'Fitzy' Fitzgerald (pictured) and Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli struggled to contain their emotions while talking to a recent widow on radio on Friday</p>

<p>'People don't like to talk about this, they bottle it up. We need to talk about these things...' explained Fitzy. </p>

<p>'We've got an amazing artist Sia who's come on board as well, and from a couple of mates, we want to tell you we've got your back and we want to get you back up on your feet.' </p>

<p>Tough times: The Fitzy &amp; Wippa hosts were talking to Steve (pictured), a listener who'd lost his wife to breast cancer on Mother's Day this year, before then losing his job and home amid the coronavirus pandemic</p>

<p>Clearly moved, Steve told the radio hosts their assistance was 'very much appreciated' and called their generosity 'unbelievable'.</p>

<p>The duo then told Steve they were going to give him another $10,000 so he could pay off his late wife's car.</p>

<p>Finally, an emotional Fitzy told Steve they were also going to build a bench seat in the cemetery in memory of his late wife, so he'd have somewhere to sit whenever he visited her grave. </p>

<p>Last month, Sia  pledged $100, 000 to Nova FM to be given out to deserving recipients amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>She said at the time: 'I like do-gooding. Maybe wanna do something together? Like, maybe I'll give you guys $100,000 that you can give out to people?'</p>

<p>'We've heard about your story, 2020 to say the least for a lot of people has been a shocker, and yours in particular,' Michael 'Wippa' Wipfli (pictured) told Steve via FaceTime</p>
