<p>'Very soft and warm. Just what my daughter wanted for curling up on the sofa to watch TV but it also looks nice folded over the bottom of her bed. One side is a grey smooth and velvety, the other is a soft white fleece.'</p>

<p>Another shopper raved: 'My new favourite thing. An absolutely wonderful product. Possibly the softest thing I've ever felt and so warm! It's perfect for snuggling on the sofa or putting on top of the duvet for an extra layer on a cold night.'</p>

<p>Customers are finding plenty of use for the snuggly throw: 'The dark grey side is so soft, like velvet, and the sherpa fleece side is lovely and soft too but not as silky as the velvet side, so it helps the throw stay on the sofa and not slide off like some other throws I've had. I liked them so much I ended up buying 4.' </p>

<p>The dual-sided super soft blanket has a fleece face and plush sherpa reverse, perfect for snuggling up with in bed or on the sofa </p>

<p>'This blanket is a lovely big size and great for wrapping yourself in to keep warm on cold mornings rather than switch on the electric fan heater. It really does keep you snug. I also use it as an extra blanket on the bed and it makes so much difference.'</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Amazing- so so warm and soft and snuggly. I got a double size one because I find usually blankets aren't big enough to wrap around me and my feet when I'm stretched out on the sofa, but the double is soooo big, I could've probably got the single one because the double is huge!'</p>
