<p>Female fund managers have outperformed their male colleagues so far this year, according to research.</p>

<p>The investment industry has had a rollercoaster ride since the start of the pandemic, trying to cope with volatile markets and spot the next big trends.</p>

<p>But Goldman Sachs found that women have done best. The average female-managed fund has lagged its benchmark by 0.6 per cent this year â€“ while the average fund with no woman as a manager underperformed by 1.6 per cent.</p>

<p>The investment bank told clients: 'Female-managed funds withstood many of the market swings.'</p>

<p>A number of senior women in UK financial services made their name in fund management, including Dame Helena Morrissey, Nichola Pease and Nicola Horlick.</p>

<p>Currently the likes of Aberdeen Standard's Lesley Duncan, and the Herald Investment Trust's Katie Potts, are at the top of their game.</p>

<p>The edge which women have was still evident when Goldman adjusted for the riskiness of different funds.</p>

<p>Part of their stronger performance was due to the types of stocks which the female-managed funds tend to hold.</p>

<p>They have a greater exposure to the tech sector, which has been booming as investors have piled in to take advantage of the expected growth of companies like Amazon and Apple.</p>

<p>Male-managed funds, on the other hand, prefer investing in financial companies.</p>

<p>Despite the better performance which women have achieved, there are still few female fund managers around.</p>

<p>Goldman said that out of the 496 large-cap funds it has analysed recently, 14 have an all-female fund manager team, and 380 have an all-male team.</p>

<p>And even though they tend to perform better, the female-managed funds have seen investors pull more money out since the start of the year than their male-managed counterparts.</p>
