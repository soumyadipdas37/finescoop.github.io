<p>The blonde bombshell, who was 31-years-old at the time, was propositioned to freeze her eggs and share the journey online.</p>

<p>Tully said she 'felt ambushed' by the idea as she was 'not ready to give up on my Pinterest dream of the husband and the white picket fence with 2.5 kids'.</p>

<p>And it also got her thinking: 'Should I be worried about freezing my eggs?' </p>

<p>'The thought that this PR team was sitting around a desk on a Monday morning, spit balling who they could reach out to and my name was written on that white board,' Tully explained.</p>

<p> '... oh that girl from Big Brother - she's been single for about seven years. She's sad and lonely. She's a spinster. She can't get a date. She wants babies.</p>

<p>'I was like, oh my god, a whole team has sat together and thought I'd be a great candidate and that is f***ing depressing.'  </p>

<p>'There were so many “OMG REALLY?” moments, I forgot we were recording and instead kept rattling off all my questions like “When is the best time to freeze your eggs?”, “When is it too late?” and “What happens if there is a blackout and the power gets cut off and the eggs go off like the 6 pack of sausages in my freezer?”' </p>

<p>Fans reacted positively to Tully's opportunity and openness with the idea of freezing her eggs, with many sharing their own fertility journey and battle with conception.  </p>
