<p>Kizzee, who was shot and killed in August, wasn't holding a gun when they opened fire, attorneys for his family said Tuesday, contradicting a claim that he had picked up a dropped weapon during a struggle. </p>

<p>Carl Douglas, a civil rights attorney who is representing Kizzee's family, said an independent autopsy commissioned by relatives shows he was struck 15 times.</p>

<p>The attorney said the independent autopsy shows that Kizzee did not die instantly and instead writhed on the ground in pain. </p>

<p>Kizzee, 29, 'posed no threat' to deputies when they fired 19 shots at him, civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump said at a news conference.</p>

<p>Crump also represents the families of George Floyd and Jacob Blake. Floyd was killed when a Minneapolis officer knelt on his neck, and Blake was left paralyzed by a police shooting in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>

<p>Kizzee, 29, (pictured) was shot and killed by two cops while he was out riding his bike in South Los Angeles in August </p>

<p>Those incidents prompted nationwide protests. Kizzee's death also sparked a series of mostly peaceful demonstrations.</p>

<p>'It is with a heavy heart that I'm standing with yet another black family who has lost a loved one because of the excessive brutal force of the people who are supposed to protect and serve them,' Crump said.</p>

<p>Kizzee's family stood with Crump and the other attorneys, including his stepbrother and aunts. They wore masks, buttons and shirts that said 'Justice for Dijon Kizzee.' Several wept.</p>

<p>'All I want is justice for my nephew,' said Fletcher Fair, Kizzee's aunt, as she called for the deputies to be arrested. 'He didn't have to be killed like that. He's no animal. He's human like we are.'</p>

<p>Kizzee was killed on August 31 in South Los Angeles after sheriff's deputies tried to stop him for riding a bicycle in the wrong direction. They said they were unaware he had a weapon wrapped in a piece of clothing he was carrying at the time.</p>

<p>Two deputies told investigators they fatally shot Kizzee after he picked up the handgun he had dropped during a struggle with one of them, authorities said last week. A video shows him stooping down. But a wall blocks a full view, and no weapon can be seen.</p>

<p>It doesn't appear the deputies tried to de-escalate the situation before shooting Kizzee. Authorities previously said Kizzee had only 'made a motion' toward the gun but last week reported that the deputies claimed he had picked it up.</p>

<p>Kizzee was shot multiple times in the chest and arms and once in the back, authorities have said. The full autopsy hasn't been completed yet.</p>

<p>Douglas said witnesses said the deputies fired three or four shots at Kizzee, followed by a pause and then a second volley while he was on the ground. </p>

<p>Kizzee's family say his death is the latest in a string of unwarranted and unlawful killings of black Americans by police. He is shown (right) with a woman believed to be his ex-girlfriend</p>

<p>Graphic new footage has captured the moment black cyclist Dijon Kizzee, 29, was gunned down in the street by LA cops who allegedly shot him 20 times and then handcuffed his dead body</p>

<p>'We have no comment about the private autopsy results,' Sheriff's Homicide Bureau Capt. Kent Wegener said in a statement.</p>

<p>Douglas said 19 gunshots shows poor police training and a pervasive 'warrior mentality' among law enforcement nationwide.</p>

<p>'Until we change that warrior mentality to more of a guardian mentality, there's going to be more (families) who have lost loved ones,' he said. 'There's a scourge that patrols the county of Los Angeles.'</p>

<p>The attorneys also questioned why the deputies sought to stop Kizzee while he was bicycling, calling it another example of 'biking while Black' and racial profiling.</p>

<p>Crump called Kizzee's death part of racial injustice and police brutality that have been part of the U.S. for centuries.</p>

<p>Two officers - who have not been named - are seen aiming their firearms at the downed suspect having seemingly just shot him. They then allegedly handcuffed his dead body </p>

<p>'We in black America are dealing with the 1619 pandemic,' he said, referring to the year when the first enslaved Africans were brought to Jamestown, Virginia. </p>

<p>'This is an epidemic. The 1619 pandemic has claimed its latest victim.'</p>

<p>The attorney's claims come after police last week claimed Kizzee bent down to pick up a loaded pistol before he was gunned down by cops.</p>

<p>Cops released new details about the shooting death of Kizzee in a press conference last Thursday including never-before-seen footage of the incident as well as video taken from Kizzee's cellphone in the days leading up to his death. </p>

<p>LA County Sheriff's Captain Kent Wegener claimed that Kizzee was in possession of a 9mm semiautomatic handgun loaded with 15 live rounds when the two deputies shot him dead. </p>

<p>Wegener said Kizzee dropped the pistol during a struggle with one of the deputies, during which he punched the officer in the head.</p>

<p>He said Kizzee then bent over, picked it up and had the gun in his hand when the deputies opened fire. </p>

<p>LA County sheriff's Captain Kent Wegener said last Thursday Kizzee was in possession of a 9mm semiautomatic handgun (pictured) loaded with 15 live rounds when the two deputies shot him. The attorneys' claims at a press conference on Tuesday dispute this </p>

<p>The gun had been reported stolen from a Las Vegas home back in February 2017, he said.</p>

<p>The cops released footage allegedly recovered from Kizzee's smartphone showing the 29-year-old with the same firearm in the days leading up to his death. </p>

<p>In the cellphone footage, the handgun is seen tucked in what appears to be Kizzee's trousers.</p>

<p>Authorities said the serial number seen in the footage matches the one found at the scene.</p>

<p>No audio was released from the video because, when pressed, Wegener said it featured a 'rap song with the f-bomb and n-word'. </p>

<p>Kizzee's death has sparked protests in LA calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism after what marks yet another incident where a black man has been killed by cops in recent months. </p>
