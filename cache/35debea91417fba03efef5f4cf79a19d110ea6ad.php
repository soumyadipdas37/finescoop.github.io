<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez, Martin Braithwaite and Samuel Umtiti could be part of a 12-man firesale at Barcelona, according to reports in Spain.</p>

<p>The Catalan giants are looking to add at least three names to their squad this summer after resolving the transfer saga involving Lionel Messi last month.</p>

<p>But the club acknowledge they must address their overly-inflated wage bill and Mundo Deportivo claim 12 players are yet to clarify their future with the club.</p>

<p>Luis Suarez could head a list of 12 players to depart Barcelona during this transfer window</p>

<p>New boss Ronaldo Koeman is also unconvinced by January signing Martin Braithwaite</p>

<p>Forward Suarez appeared set for a move to Juventus, with just a medical and bonuses to sort out, but the report claims Atletico Madrid have arrived on the scene and the Uruguayan's openness to staying in Spain has changed the scenario.</p>

<p>If and when the 33-year-old departs, Barcelona will be left with controversial January signing Martin Braithwaite as their only natural central striker.</p>

<p>But the Spanish outlet claims new boss Ronald Koeman is not totally convinced by the Dane and would like time to cast his eye over him, despite admiring his professionalism.</p>

<p>The 29-year-old's agent has reportedly offered his client around in the transfer market but has not received any interest for the Denmark international. </p>

<p>The Dutchman has also told centre-back Samuel Umtiti that his future lies away from the club</p>

<p>The news comes after Barcelona managed to resolve the future of star player Lionel Messi</p>

<p>Arturo Vidal could also be among the first to leave the club alongside Suarez, but the report admits the current financial slump is holding up his move to Inter Milan. </p>

<p>Centre-back Samuel Umtiti is also a player who Barcelona would like to sell, and although the France international initially refused to leave the Camp Nou he has been told by Koeman that his future lies elsewhere, with former club Lyon best placed to sign him.</p>

<p>Fellow Frenchman Jean-Clair Todibo's future also lies away from the club, who are demanding a £23million (€25m) fee for him amid Premier League interest from Everton and Leicester City. </p>

<p>Despite making him unavailable for transfer earlier in the summer, Nelson Semedo could also depart the Camp Nou if an offer that is impossible to reject arrives, with the club already seeking to strengthen in wide areas.</p>

<p>Arturo Vidal is also in talks to move to Inter Milan but the financial slump is holding up a move</p>

<p>Centre-back Jean-Clair Todibo is reportedly a target for both Everton and Leicester City</p>

<p>Rafinha Alcantara spent some of last season on loan at Celta Vigo, but with the Spanish side unable to make the move permanent due to his £15million (€16m) release clause, he has returned to the Camp Nou.</p>

<p>Koeman is reportedly happy with his performances, but Barcelona's desperation to sell this summer may yet see him depart if a suitable offer arrives.</p>

<p>The list of potential departures is completed by left-backs Junior Firpo and Miranda, as well as youngsters Moussa Wague, Barcelona B central midfielder Monchu and defensive midfielder Oriol Busquets, with Watford said to be considering a loan with an option to buy for the latter.</p>

<p>Koeman has been impressed by Rafinha Alcantara but Barcelona are desperate to sell now</p>
