<p>Lockdown has heaped misery on the Government’s smart-meter rollout, as installations crept up by 0.4 per cent in three months.</p>

<p>Only 135,000 smart meters were installed between April and June, down from 980,000 in the first three months of the year, according to Government figures.</p>

<p>The drop was expected, as suppliers focused on emergency metering work due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus. </p>

<p>Ministers had aimed to install the gadgets in all homes and small businesses by 2020, they then pushed the target back to 2024 due to technical issues. </p>

<p>It was then extended to 2025 after lockdown put work on hold.</p>

<p>Robert Cheesewright, director of corporate affairs at Smart Energy GB, says: ‘We expect installation numbers to rebound as restrictions are eased.’</p>
