<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A woman who killed three of her children by driving them into a Melbourne lake has been sentenced for the third time in as many years.</p>

<p>Akon Guode must spend at least 14 years behind bars for deliberately driving her car into the Wyndham Vale lake in April 2015, while severely depressed.</p>

<p>Her 16-month-old son Bol, and four-year-old twins Hanger and Madit, died. But her daughter Alual, then aged five, survived.</p>

<p>Their mother's case has been subject to multiple appeals.</p>

<p>Akon Guode (left) killed three of her children by driving them into a lake in April 2015</p>

<p>One-year-old Bol (left) and four-year-old twins Hanger and Maudit (right) all died when their mother intentionally drove a car carrying them into a Melbourne lake</p>

<p>Guode was originally jailed in 2017 for 26-and-a-half years, after pleading guilty to two charges of murder, and once each of infanticide and attempted murder.</p>

<p>The refugee had survived rape and seen her soldier husband shot-dead in war-torn Sudan before coming to Australia.</p>

<p>Given the circumstances, Guode lawyers thought her original jail term was too harsh and took it to the Court of Appeal.</p>

<p>In 2018, it reduced the sentence to 18 years, with a minimum of 14, on the basis of Guode's disturbed mental state when she killed her children.</p>

<p>However, prosecutors weren't happy and re-appealed the case to Australia's highest court, which in March decided the appeal judges got it wrong.</p>

<p>They erred in considering Guode's guilty plea to infanticide, and her relevant mental state, in re-sentencing her for murder and attempted murder, the High Court found.</p>

<p>The Crown reportedly argued the sentencing judge took into account Guode's mental state (pictured car being pulled from water) </p>

<p>The mother said she was mentally disturbed after giving birth when she drove the family car into the lake (pictured) killing the three children</p>

<p>The case was sent back to the Court of Appeal and the same three judges on Wednesday affirmed their decision from two years prior.</p>

<p>Chief Justice Anne Ferguson, and Justices David Beach and Phillip Priest, said the reduced sentence took into account factors including mercy.</p>

<p>They also noted the delay Guode had endured while her punishment was appealed twice.</p>

<p>'It should not be thought that, in reaching (the conclusions we have reached), we have lost sight of the fact that three vulnerable children lost their lives (and that a fourth nearly did),' the judges said, repeating some of their comments from two years earlier.</p>

<p>'Adjectives such as 'tragic' are inadequate to convey the depth of emotional response provoked by the destruction of such innocent lives.'</p>

<p>But the judges maintained the original jail sentence was too harsh given Guode's 'pitiable' situation and severely compromised mental state when she drove into the lake.</p>
