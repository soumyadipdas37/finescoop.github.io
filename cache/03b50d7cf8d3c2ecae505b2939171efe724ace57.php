<p>'Rest in sweet peace': Celebrity tributes poured in this Friday for Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who died at the age of 87</p>

<p>'Thank you for a lifetime of service': The liberal lion of the nation's highest court received a flood of tributes from such names as Mariah Carey and Katy Perry</p>

<p>Her fellow pop star Katy Perry also expressed her condolences via Twitter, writing: '#RIPRBG' with a broken heart emoji. </p>

<p>Morning talk show host Kelly Ripa posted a picture of Ginsburg and wrote: '#rip RBG. The right kind of notorious. What a loss,' with a heart emoji.</p>

<p>She was referring to Ginsburg's affectionate nickname 'Notorious RBG,' which was a play on the late rapper, the Notorious BIG. </p>

<p>Shortly before her death Ginsburg said: 'My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.' </p>

<p>The election in November pits Republican incumbent U.S. President Donald Trump  against the Democrat former vice president Joe Biden.</p>

<p>Supreme Court Justices are nominated by the President Of The United States and then confirmed by the Senate.</p>

<p>Early this month Trump unveiled a short-list of potential Supreme Court nominees including Republican Senators Ted Cruz, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley.</p>

<p>If Trump picks Ginsburg's replacement the balance of the court will be six Republican appointees to three Democrat ones, whereas if Biden chooses there will be four Democrat appointees to five Republican ones, as when Ginsburg was alive.</p>

<p>January Jones of Mad Men fame acknowledged the impact of Ginsburg's death on the election when she posted a tribute to the late judge this Friday.</p>

<p>Sharing Ginsburg's high school yearbook photo, Jones wrote: 'Rest in sweet peace to this beautiful champion of the people. Please vote. #RBG.'</p>

<p>Andy Cohen posted the hashtag: '#MerrickGarland,' the name of the judge President Obama nominated to the Supreme Court in March 2016.</p>

<p>Obama submitted Garland as a nominee after the death of the court's conservative firebrand Antonin Scalia precipitating a huge row.</p>

<p>The Republican Senate refused to hold confirmation hearings for him, saying the next president should get to pick Scalia's as it was Obama's last year.</p>

<p>When Obama was replaced by Donald Trump the new Republican president nominated Neil Gorsuch whom the Senate confirmed. </p>
