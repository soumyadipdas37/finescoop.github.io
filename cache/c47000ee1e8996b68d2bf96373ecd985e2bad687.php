<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Julie Bishop has opened up on the heartache of being separated from her partner due to coronavirus border closures.</p>

<p>The former Foreign Minister, 64, was no stranger to jetting to different states around Australia or countries as part of her job.</p>

<p>But Ms Bishop has been stuck in Perth for the past six months and has not seen her partner David Panton, who is in Sydney. </p>

<p>The couple have been separated for six months due to closed borders to control the spread of COVID-19 (pictured together)</p>

<p>'The first place I will go is to Sydney to see David,' Ms Bishop told The Daily Telegraph about borders reopening. </p>

<p>'We FaceTime. It isn't great but it is all you can do because he can't get in here (WA) and I can't go there without having to get an exemption. It is very difficult but I know a lot of families have been separated in this way, it is challenging.' </p>

<p>Ms Bishop also revealed said she does not miss politics after 20 years in parliament. </p>

<p>The private life that comes with being Chancellor of the Australian National University is something that was a long time coming, she said. </p>

<p>Ms Bishop revealed that they FaceTime but it was just not the same as being there (pictured together)</p>

<p>Ms Bishop is also working with Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation to help raise awareness and funds.</p>

<p>The foundation is close to her heart after two of her sisters were treated with ovarian cysts when they were younger.</p>

<p>With almost 14,000 women dying from ovarian cancer each year, Ms Bishop is pushing for early detection tests. </p>

<p>'I think there needs to be a greater effort to find better treatments along the road to a cure and that is most certainly why I think we need an early detection test,' she said.  </p>
