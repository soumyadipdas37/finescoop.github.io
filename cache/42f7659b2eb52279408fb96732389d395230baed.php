<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Marks and Spencer's Ocado deal has been hailed as a huge success with more people buying its goods than the Waitrose items it replaced. </p>

<p>M&amp;S signed a £750 million deal last year to own half of Ocado's retail business and launched its products on the delivery website at the start of the month.</p>

<p>Now, Ocado has revealed that the switch from Waitrose to M&amp;S led to a surge in its shares, as well as a significant rise in sales.</p>

<p>The online grocer had its busiest-ever day for orders when the M&amp;S partnership launched on September 1, with demand outstripping even the stockpiling frenzy in March.</p>

<p>Average shopper baskets have also grown by about five items since the switch over. </p>

<p>There has been particularly strong demand for M&amp;S's famed ready meals, as well as staples such as milk and carrots.  </p>

<p>M&amp;S has also sold high numbers of cucumbers and cans of chopped tomatoes, as it tries to position itself as the best choice for everyday grocery shopping online. </p>

<p>Among the most requested items were the iconic Percy Pig sweets, with 20,000 packets pre-ordered before September 1. </p>

<p>Average shopper basket size and weekly orders to Ocado have increased compared to last year following the announcement of the new partnership with M&amp;S - which started this month</p>

<p>Average shopper baskets have also grown by about five items since the switch over - with M&amp;S carrots one of the more popular items</p>

<p>Shares in Ocado have also hit a record high amid the new M&amp;S partnership.</p>

<p>Ocado has been selling M&amp;S goods on its website alongside its own the 20-year partnership with Waitrose came to an end.</p>

<p>Allaying fears shoppers would desert Ocado once it made the switch, finance boss Duncan Tatton-Brown said there was 'practically no sign' that it had lost any customers.</p>

<p>The online retailer reported a 52 per cent jump in retail sales to £587.3 million during the 13 weeks to the end of August. </p>

<p>Ocado shares surged after it revealed the success of the partnership, rising 10.7 per cent.</p>

<p>Stuart Machin, head of M&amp;S food, said: 'Taking our full food range online for the first time is transformative for M&amp;S food and brings to life our strategy to protect the magic, the delicious, quality food and trusted sourcing standards customers love—whilst modernizing the rest.</p>

<p>Ocado had its busiest-ever day for orders when the M&amp;S partnership launched on September 1, with demand outstripping even the stockpiling frenzy in March. </p>

<p>Ahead of the launch, it also received more pre-orders than for any other day in its history. </p>

<p>The most popular M&amp;S items with Ocado shoppers are: </p>

<p>20,000 packets of Percy Pig sweets were also ordered on the opening day. </p>

<p>'This is a long-term partnership and in preparation for go-live we have listened intently to customers to deliver an even bigger, better range—with more family pack sizes, more scratch cooking ingredients, household staples and organic options.</p>

<p>'As more families shop for M&amp;S products online, they will see the breadth that M&amp;S food has to offer and we're confident they will find we remain serious on quality whilst also being serious about value.' </p>

<p>M&amp;S is pinning its hopes on the tie-up after the pandemic caused havoc and led to plans to cut 7,000 jobs from its 66,000-strong shop-floor workforce.</p>

<p>Analysts had been sceptical last year when it paid £750million to buy a 50 per cent stake in Ocado's retail business, which marks the first time its groceries have been put on sale online. </p>

<p>So far the 4,000 Waitrose products that were available on Ocado's site have been replaced by 4,400 M&amp;S items.</p>

<p>Another 800 food options will be added to its range in the run-up to Christmas, capitalising on M&amp;S's reputation for doing high-quality party treats.</p>

<p>Ocado hailed the 'successful switchover' from Waitrose to M&amp;S as it posted a huge rise in sales during the 13 weeks to September 1.</p>

<p>Quarterly revenue surged by 52 per cent to £587million compared with the same period of last year.</p>

<p>And the average number of orders it received per week rose by 10 per cent to 345,000, as it managed to keep hold of customers who signed up during lockdown.</p>

<p>Ocado expects profits to reach around £40million in 2020. It booked a £43.3million profit in 2019.</p>

<p>Its M&amp;S partnership got off to a rocky start, with some customers complaining that orders had been cancelled at short notice.</p>

<p>Ocado blamed this on a 'surge in demand'. It plans to increase its capacity by a further 40 per cent next year by building three more of its robotic warehouses in Andover, Bristol and Purfleet.</p>

<p>Taste test: Ocado has been selling M&amp;S goods on its website alongside its own since September 1 when a 20-year partnership with Waitrose came to an end</p>

<p>Ocado shares have risen 103 per cent this year and the company is now valued at £19.5bn, just £2bn less than Tesco</p>

<p>Analysts said the results had not just been promising for Ocado, but also for M&amp;S.</p>

<p>Sophie Lund-Yates, an equity analyst at investment manager Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'This could bode well for Marks &amp; Spencer, whose sales could do with a boost, and who staked a lot on this deal paying off.</p>

<p>'98pc of customers are already shopping at M&amp;S, though, so it will be interesting to see how many of these sales will have simply transferred from stores.'</p>

<p>Peel Hunt analysts said Ocado had had a 'storming' third quarter. They said: 'The M&amp;S transition is performing excellently: nearly every customer is already shopping for M&amp;S products and the weighing in-basket of those products is greater than it was with Waitrose's products.'</p>
