<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A bullied 14-year-old pupil at a £30,000 a year boarding school took his own life just days after cruel classmates smeared excrement on his pillow.</p>

<p>French-born Pierre DaCosta Noble was found hanged on the grounds of the prestigious Windermere School in the Lake District on November 9.</p>

<p>An inquest into his death on Monday heard Pierre would have been “deeply upset” by the pillow incident, which impacted his decision to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Cockermouth Coroner’s Court was also told how on a separate occasion the teenager had poo smeared inside one of his shoes.</p>

<p>Officials from Windermere School described Pierre, who joined as a boarder in Spring 2019, as a 'model student'.</p>

<p>But the court heard he had told friends he was not enjoying his time at there.</p>

<p>Paul Ainsworth, a physics teacher and house master of Pierre, said: 'Someone had put excrement in his boot and smeared it on the inside of his pillow.</p>

<p>Windermere School in the Lake District charges £30,000 a year and was attended by Pierre</p>

<p>'We found it odd that he was targeted as he was well liked.'</p>

<p>Describing the night Pierre died, Mr Ainsworth said he went missing when it was time for the boys to go to bed.</p>

<p>The inquest heard he signed out just after an evening meeting at around 8pm and had not returned.</p>

<p>Mr Ainsworth said he thought Pierre would either be in a friend’s block or speaking with his parents on the phone so asked a couple of senior boys to look for him.</p>

<p>The hearing heard the two pupils returned visibly upset after finding the Year 9 student hanged.</p>

<p>Mr Ainsworth tried to resuscitate Pierre until the emergency services arrived and took him to Royal Lancaster Infirmary, where he was later pronounced dead.</p>

<p>The house master said he did not follow normal protocol, to raise the fire alarm when a child goes missing, due to concerns it would cause Pierre more distress on what was already a difficult week.</p>

<p>The coroner asked Joanna Parry, deputy head of pastoral care at Windermere School at the time, whether he made the right decision.</p>

<p>She said: “I believe he made a good decision. He did not know what the students were going to find when they went out,”</p>

<p>A multi-agency report into Pierre’s death had originally said the excrement incident had no impact on his decision to take his own life.</p>

<p>But Jennifer Davies, head of safeguarding at Windermere School, told coroner Andrew Tweddle she no longer thought it had come to the right conclusion. </p>

<p>Headteacher Ian Lavender was asked by the coroner why he never had any face to face interaction with the student.</p>

<p>He explained there was a system in place and that he was aware of the incident, classed as bullying, but would only be involved himself further down the line.</p>

<p>Mr Lavender added: “I deeply regret that I did not get involved with the matter sooner.”</p>

<p>The coroner said: “It is clear what his intentions were. It is my conclusion that Pierre did deliberately intend to take his own life.”</p>

<p>Windermere School is a 157-year-old independent, coeducational boarding and day school in the Lake District with 350 students. </p>
