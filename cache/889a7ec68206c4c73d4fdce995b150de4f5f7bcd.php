<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The Air Force is working on a laser-mounted vehicle that can detonate landmines, bombs and other explosives from nearly 1,000 feet away.</p>

<p>Virginia-based Parsons Corporation won a $40 million contract to develop the Recovery of Airbase Denied by Ordnance (RADBO) system, according to C4ISRNET.</p>

<p>When completed, it will be able to fire more than 984 feet away.</p>

<p>According to Parsons, the laser is powerful enough 'to detonate small submunitions from cluster bombs, landmines, general-purposed bombs and thick-cased artillery rounds,' according to Parsons.</p>

<p>The system, which will be used to clear hazards out of airfields, is made up of a mine-resistant Cougar infantry vehicle, Parsons' three-kilowatt ZEUS laser weapon, and an 'arm' that can remove debris or other obstacles.  </p>

<p>Virginia-based Parsons Corporation won a $40 million contract to develop the Recovery of Airbase Denied by Ordnance (RADBO) system, which it claims will be able to explode landmines and other ordinance from a safe 986-foot distance</p>

<p>Parsons VP Hector Cuevas said in a statement the company was 'delivering a game-changing war-fighting product,' .</p>

<p>'We're proud to partner with the Air Force in deploying this critical force protection and mission enabling technology that will greatly increase safe and effective explosive ordnance disposal operations.'</p>

<p>RADBO is one of three orders the Air Force Research Lab has placed with Parsons totaling $69 million- the price tag includes 13 vehicles and three spares.</p>

<p>It's being built in Huntsville, Alabama, and is expected to be completed in 2023. </p>

<p>RADBO, which will be used to clear hazards out of airfields, is made up of a mine-resistant Cougar infantry vehicle, Parsons' three-kilowatt ZEUS laser weapon and an 'arm' that can remove debris or other obstacles</p>

<p>It's estimated there are some 80 million active landmines around the world.</p>

<p>Each year 15,000 to 20,000 people are injured, maimed or killed by mines, according to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.</p>

<p>But not all the methods to find them are so high-tech: Scientists in Croatia have bred bees that can detect buried landmines from more than three miles away.</p>

<p>And on Friday, an African giant pouched rat was awarded a medal for detecting dozens of mines in Cambodia.</p>

<p>In the past four years, Magawa, a rat trained by the Tanzanian nonprofit APOPO to sniff out explosives and warn his human handlers, has cleared more than 1.5 million square feet.</p>

<p>In that time, he's found 39 land mines and 28 pieces of ordnance, according to NPR.</p>

<p>An African giant pouched rat sniffs for traces of landmine explosives at APOPO's training facility in Tanzania. This month, a UK pet charity awarded one of the rats a gold medal for 'devotion to duty'</p>

<p>The British pet charity PDSA bestowed Magawa with a gold medal, the first time in its 77-year-history a rodent had received an honor.</p>

<p>The PDSA Gold Medal recognizes non-military animals for 'gallantry or devotion to duty' and has previously been given to dogs, horses, pigeons and even a cat.</p>

<p>During a virtual ceremony, APOPO Ceo Christophe Cox said landmine detection was 'expensive and tedious' work.</p>

<p>'That's why we came up with the idea of using rats, because rats are fast,' Cox said.</p>

<p>'They can screen an area of 200 square meters in half an hour - something which would take a manual de-miner four days.'</p>
