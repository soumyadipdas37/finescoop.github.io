<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>TikTok may be known for its dance crazes, comedy videos and 60 second lip-syncs, but a new trend is sweeping the social media app. </p>

<p>Since January, the hashtag #writeaprisoner has spread on the platform, encouraging users to visit a website which can connect them with a convicted criminal, who they can then become pen pals with.  </p>

<p>The hashtag has racked up over 84.8 million views and is filled with countless users who have reached out to prisoners and received letters, emails, phone calls and video calls from an inmate of their choice.  </p>

<p>While the website WriteAPrisoner.com is mainly compiled of US prisoners, it has a smaller international inmate locator, allowing the service to attract users from all around the world. </p>

<p>A new trend sweeping TikTok has seen young users become pen pals with convicted criminals. Pictured left, Gavon Ramsay, now 19, who is facing life in prison. Pictured right, letters to Jessica, from New York, from inmates </p>

<p>Users have shared examples of the letters, poems, 'mix tape' song lists and even art work they have received from inmates - with some revealing they've planned to meet up both while in prison, and once they've been released. </p>

<p>Emily Shires, from Leeds, started writing to her prison pen pal Julian during lockdown, and compared the website to TV show 'Take Me Out'. </p>

<p>Explaining why she joined the site, Emily said in one of her videos: 'Lockdown's had me really bored so I found this website called WriteAPrisoner.com and you can literally just browse through a load of inmates in prison all over the USA. </p>

<p>'You can see all their pictures, what they were incarcerated for and all that stuff - so it's a bit like Take Me Out. ' </p>

<p>The website WriteAPrisoner.com is mainly compiled of US prisoners and connects inmates with users from all around the world </p>

<p>But for Emily, what started as a way to pass the time quickly blossomed into a fully fledged friendship, which she described as both 'platonic and romantic'. </p>

<p>She described her pen pal, who has been convicted of Conspiracy to Distribute Cocaine, 'lovely, really intelligent and with great chat'. </p>

<p>However, she admitted the pair do not discuss his crime and said: 'I reached out to get to know him, not about what he did, and I actually don't think it's any of my business'. </p>

<p>The pen pals speak every other day and Emily has insisted her parents are in full support of their friendship. </p>

<p>While she's not allowed to send her inmate gifts, Emily can send photos of herself which are printed out through an app and delivered to him by prison guards. </p>

<p>Emily has planned a trip to the US at the end of October, and urged other users who may be thinking of writing to an inmate to be 'respectful and nice', insisting 'these are real people with real feelings'.</p>

<p>Another user looking for love on the website was Amaya Jones, 17, from the US, who wrote to Gavon Ramsay, now 19, who three years ago was convicted for the aggravated murder of an elderly victim, aggravated robbery, kidnapping, and abuse of a corpse.</p>

<p>Gavon was sentenced to life in prison. He is currently appealing his sentence.  </p>

<p>Amaya can be heard in one of her videos saying: 'So I heard if you're like me and you really want a boyfriend, all you have to do is go to WriteAnPrisoner.com and you can find an inmate and become pen pals. So after searching for a while with no avail...'</p>

<p>The video then has text written on it saying: 'I found Gavon. He murdered someone, but he's cute.'  </p>

<p>However, not everyone writing to prisoners is looking for love, and Jessica, who attends Cornell University in New York, has multiple pen pals, who she began writing to before the TikTok trend went viral. </p>

<p>'Keep it simple, talk about your interests, if you're in school talk about that, ask get to know you questions'. </p>

<p>She went on to advise not asking about their crime 'right away', never giving money to your pen pal, while always being transparent about your reasons for writing a letter. </p>

<p>'I wouldn't ask them about their crime right away', she said, 'Normally they are pretty open about it but you don't want them to think that's why you're writing to them right away. </p>

<p>'Normally these guys are looking for something romantic, a woman to support them financially and emotionally, so tell them what you're looking for.' </p>

<p>In a separate video she advised: 'Never send them money. You have to be super safe about it.' </p>

<p>She also warned of prisoners selling your information on to other inmates, saying: 'Also if you're getting letter back from someone different, the initial person you wrote to likely sold your information, so be aware of that.'  </p>
