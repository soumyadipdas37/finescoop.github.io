<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro is taking mental health leave for up to four weeks after a tumultuous fortnight dominated by koala protection policy.</p>

<p>The outspoken NSW Nationals leader will miss next week's sitting of parliament.</p>

<p>His deputy Paul Toole has been installed acting leader.</p>

<p>Mr Barilaro put himself in the firing line last week when he threatened to implode the coalition government if concessions on the state's koala protection policy were not made.</p>

<p>He backed down after Premier Gladys Berejiklian gave him an ultimatum that Nationals MPs support the government or its ministers be sacked from cabinet.</p>

<p>He survived a no-confidence motion in state parliament on Wednesday despite senior government's minister publicly disparaging his actions.</p>

<p>More to come.Â </p>
