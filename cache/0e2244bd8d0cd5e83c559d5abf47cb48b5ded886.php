<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Tiger King star Howard Baskin reveals that he and wife Carole were forced to carry a pistol in their car following Joe Exotic's death threats.</p>

<p>Harold, 70, appeared on Friday's Loose Women in place of his big cat activist wife, 59, who missed her interview last week due to a scheduling conflict.</p>

<p>And while speaking to panelists Christine Lampard, Judi Love and Jane Moore, Howard explained the extreme lengths they went to in order to protect themselves as well as express his dismay over how his wife was portrayed on the Netflix show. </p>

<p>Shocking: Tiger King star Howard Baskin reveals that he and wife Carole were forced to carry a pistol in their car following Joe Exotic's death threats</p>

<p>Carole's nemesis Joe Exotic, 57, is serving a 22-year jail sentence for the murder-for-hire of Carole and charges of animal abuse.</p>

<p>Following Joe's threats as well as the horrific abuse and threats made to them after the show was aired, Howard admitted that the couple were forced to arm themselves for their own protection.</p>

<p>Asked whether they feared for their lives, he said: 'There has always been that issue dealing with these people.</p>

<p>'There were very serious threats from Joe trying to hire someone to kill Carole, so we ended up taking additional precautions, once the FBI told us about Joe’s efforts.'</p>

<p>Missed: Harold, 70, appeared on Friday's Loose Women in place of his big cat activist wife, 59, who missed her interview last week due to a scheduling conflict</p>

<p>He continued: 'We put on security around the house, we started carrying a pistol in our car, we would be watching to see if we were being followed.'</p>

<p>'Looking around at the cars around you and when you park looking to see if anyone pulling in next to you'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the big cat lover hit out at the way his beloved wife was portrayed on Tiger King and noted that it concentrated on the accusations that Carole had murdered her late husband Don Lewis.</p>

<p>He ranted: 'They made her out to be a home wrecker. She supposedly broke up a marriage and was a gold digger. They made her out like she wants to be a last one standing which is ridiculous because we've always said we want to put ourselves out of business. </p>

<p>Extremes: While speaking to panelists Christine Lampard, Judi Love and Jane Moore, Howard explained the extreme lengths they went to in order to protect themselves as well as express his dismay over how his wife was portrayed on the Netflix show</p>

<p>'The whole business, the nonsense about whether she was involved in the disappearance of her husband, they just turned everything to point towards that so that people would believe that. It was just very difficult.'</p>

<p>Elsewhere during the chat, Howard refused to discuss Joe's potential release from prison, other than to claim he deserved to be in jail for the execution of tigers. </p>

<p>When asked whether he was concerned about Joe being released, he responded: 'I just don’t want to talk about him being released from prison, he belongs in prison.</p>

<p>He added: 'Forget the business about hiring someone to kill Carole. This is a man who walked up to five healthy tigers who trusted him and knew him, took a shotgun and blew their brains out.</p>

<p>Threats: 'We put on security around the house, we started carrying a pistol in our car, we would be watching to see if we were being followed'</p>

<p>'If anyone doesn’t think he belongs in jail for the rest of his life for that, they have my sympathy.'</p>

<p>When Jane Moore pressed further and questioned him about Joe potentially getting a presidential pardon from Donald Trump, Howard was quick to shut the conversation down. </p>

<p>He interjected: 'Could we move on to something else?' before earnestly repeating his request. </p>

<p>Speaking out: Meanwhile, the big cat lover hit out at the way his beloved wife was portrayed on Tiger King and noted that it concentrated on the accusations that Carole had murdered her late husband Don Lewis</p>

<p>Anger: When asked whether he was concerned about Joe being released, he responded: 'I just don’t want to talk about him being released from prison, he belongs in prison'</p>

<p>Judi Love then asked: 'Is that too distressing to talk about?', which was met with silence from Howard. </p>

<p>Howard's appearance comes after Carole sent the Loose Women panel a pre-recorded clip on Thursday, a week after cancelling her interview on the ITV programme.</p>

<p>The big-cat rights activist revealed to viewers that her husband Howard would be stepping in to discuss all things Tiger King via live link on Friday's edition of the show as she continues to train for Dancing With The Stars.</p>

<p>In her video, the Big Cat Rescue CEO issued a warning to the panel as she claimed they'll be 'asking for a Baskin' if he doesn't return in one piece following his interview.</p>

<p>She's finally arrived! Carole sent the Loose Women panel a pre-recorded clip on Thursday, a week after cancelling her interview on the ITV programme</p>

<p>The media personality addressed her no-show earlier this month as she admitted she's been preoccupied with dance commitments on the US version of Strictly Come Dancing.</p>

<p>The reality star said: 'I'm happy that my husband will be stepping in and speaking for me. He is such a wonderful person and you'll love him so much as I love him so much.</p>

<p>'In fact, when he's done I want him back girls... if you don't send him back, you're kind of asking for a Baskin!'</p>

<p>'Oooh, asking for a Baskin. What is a Baskin?', presenter Christine, 41, squealed, before comedian Judi, 40, joked: 'We don't want to find out, send him back quick time! Listen, I was obsessed with that show, there's too much juice!'</p>

<p>Exciting times ahead: The big-cat rights activist, 59, revealed to viewers that her husband Howard will be stepping in to discuss all things Tiger King via live link on Friday's edition</p>

<p>Uh oh: The reality star issued a warning to Jane Moore, Christine Lampard, Judi Love and Gloria Hunniford as she claimed they'll be 'asking for a Baskin' if he doesn't return in one piece</p>

<p>Speaking out: The Big Cat Rescue CEO addressed her no-show as she admitted she's been preoccupied with dance commitments on the US version of Strictly</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Loose Women viewers were left bitterly disappointed when Baskin cancelled her appearance  on the show. </p>

<p>Despite being tipped to chat to the panel, the big cat enthusiast cancelled at the last minute, in a move that came hours after her late husband Don Lewis's family funded an advertisement during her Dancing With The Stars debut. </p>

<p>She caused shockwaves when she signed up to Dancing With The Stars and keen to capitalise on her appearance, Don's relatives opted to take out an advert seeking information on his alleged murder. </p>

<p>Outrage: Earlier this month, Loose Women viewers were left bitterly disappointed when Baskin cancelled her appearance on the show</p>

<p>After Tiger King hit Netflix earlier this year, many viewers were intrigued by rumours that she had killed Don and fed him to the big cats in her sanctuary.</p>

<p>Despite incessant denials, the Lewis family used her DWTS debut to air a 50-second clip calling for information about his 1997 disappearance in 1997 and offered a $100,000 reward is being offered for any leads.</p>

<p>Following the advert's release, Carole said: 'I haven't seen it, but I'm not surprised. Spending time worrying about what I’m doing is probably not a really good use of your time', before she insisted the move was a publicity stunt. </p>

<p>Oh no: The big cat enthusiast cancelled at the last minute, in a move that came hours after her late husband's family funded an advertisement during her Dancing With The Stars debut</p>

<p>The scandal surrounding the advert led to debate that her reason for cancelling on Loose Women was due to the controversy. </p>

<p>Andrea McLean said on the show: 'Carole has denied any involvement in husband's disappearance, he has formally been declared dead, she is now remarried.'</p>

<p>As well as the advert hypothesis, other angry viewers alleged that the producers had merely been drawing in viewers and claimed the incident was 'a s**t show'. </p>

<p>After the show aired, the panellists reached out to Carole with a video saying they were always there for her if she needs be. </p>

<p>Carole reportedly said: 'I am so sorry, I screwed up my ever changing schedule, phone of hook with fan support/interviews... I have hours where Dancing With The Stars wants me. That has to be my priority.'</p>

<p>Viewers soon flooded Twitter, writing: 'Come on <?php echo e('@'); ?>loosewomen Carol Baskin mugged you off big time !! Couldn't even be bothered to apologise to you...</p>

<p>Not convinced: Viewers weren't  happy </p>

<p>'Don't blame the time difference (she managed to 'commit' knowing this), don't blame an advert we probably weren't likely to have seen, have some manner... </p>

<p>'Sorry but how the f**k has #LooseWomen been allowed to advertise Carol Baskin appearing on their show all morning knowing that wasn’t going to happen... </p>

<p>'What a s**t show... Wtf #loosewomen so I've just sat though all that waiting for Carol Baskin and the drama and there isn't again... </p>

<p>Outrage: Fan flooded social media to comment on the debacle </p>

<p>'I only turned into this gargabe for the Carole Baskin interview, this show should be axed... Carole Baskin thinks she is too good for #LooseWomen... </p>

<p>'You don’t have a lot of time with her because you wasted time on that non interview with Carole Baskin #LooseWomen... Why was the whole Carole Baskin interview made such a big deal of there?! Struggling for content maybe? #LooseWomen... </p>

<p>'Carole Baskin has apparently promised to give #LooseWomen her first UK exclusive interview? First the exclusive ‘Coronavirus whistleblower’ and now this.' [sic]</p>

<p>'His big interview with Carol Baskin they’ve been banging on about for days and it never happened. Why not say that in the first place? Desperate for viewers much?!'</p>
