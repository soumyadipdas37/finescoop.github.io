<p>The spectre of serial killer Dennis Nilsen haunted Daniel Mays as he tackled the role of a lifetime: the 'old school copper' who helped bring the mass murderer to justice.</p>

<p>'I watched all these documentaries,' Mays told me, 'and pored over all this research' — including Killing For Company, Brian Masters' best-selling psychological study of Nilsen.</p>

<p>Even before filming started on Des, the three-part ITV mini-series in which Mays plays Detective Chief Inspector Peter Jay, the nightmares began.</p>

<p>'On two occasions I woke up my wife, Louise, screaming, because I thought I was locked in an attic with Dennis Nilsen.' </p>

<p>Not helping matters was 'the amount of herbal cigarettes I had to smoke' (Jay was a chainsmoker). </p>

<p>Des contains masterclass performances from David Tennant, as the monster who disposed of his victims in grisly ways; Jason Watkins (Harold Wilson in The Crown) as author Masters, who visited Nilsen in jail and RADA-trained Mays, star of lockdown hit White Lines and Line Of Duty.</p>

<p>'More than anything, it was an investigation in reverse,' Mays said of the police's efforts. </p>

<p>'Here was a guy who openly admitted to 15 murders and yet because of the way he disposed of the bodies, they had no evidence. They had to find some.'</p>

<p>The 42-year-old reflected on the difference between policing then, and now; particularly how officers coped with the horrific nature of the crimes. </p>

<p>'Coppers back in 1983 didn't have counsellors. They'd just go down the pub and drink a few pints to get over it.'</p>

<p>Nilsen was collared at his flat in North London, in an area Mays once used as a cut-through. 'You do wonder which house it was,' he said. </p>

<p>'I watched all these documentaries,' Mays told me, 'and pored over all this research' — including Killing For Company, Brian Masters' best-selling psychological study of Nilsen (pictured above)</p>

<p>The making of Des, with director Lewis Arnold at the helm, was as painstaking as the police investigation into the murders. </p>

<p>Arnold and his producers spent several years on research, talking to the victim's families, and that sensitivity is reflected in the drama, over three nights from Monday. </p>

<p>'It was always told from a point of respect,' Mays said, adding that while the killings are described in graphic detail by Tennant, as Nilsen; they are not shown.</p>

<p>He added that Des also deals with 'a whole set of untruths about the case', and I urge you to watch it, to see what they are.</p>

<p>Mays was speaking to me from the 'bubble' he's sharing with Stephen Graham, during a break from filming the second series of Sky's police show Code 404.</p>

<p>Following that, he'll join Mark Strong for new episodes of Temple, which should take him through till February.</p>

<p>The spectre of serial killer Dennis Nilsen haunted Daniel Mays as he tackled the role of a lifetime: the 'old school copper' who helped bring the mass murderer to justice. Des stars David Tennant as Dennis Nilsen and Daniel Mays as DCI Peter Jay</p>

<p>'We've got Covid testing hanging over the production,' he said of Code 404. 'We're tested twice a week.' He added he felt sorriest for the crew, who had to wear masks and PPE 12 hours a day.</p>

<p>His own Lockdown was spent nursing Louise, who had slipped and shattered an ankle. Son Milo, 14, was studying for mocks; and Mays helped home school seven-year-old Dixie. 'We got through it,' he said, laughing.</p>

<p>Going back to work was initially difficult. 'I hadn't acted for seven months. In your own mind-set you've switched off.'</p>

<p>Looking further ahead, he said treading the boards again — after doing The Caretaker at the Old Vic four years ago with Timothy Spall and George McKay (who also appeared with Mays in Sam Mendes's 1917) — was a priority. He told me he's been discussing playing Macbeth for director Joe Hill-Gibbins.</p>

<p>Watching Sleepless, the musical, at the Troubadour, Wembley Park Theatre, left me singing the praises of the cast led by Jay McGuiness, Kimberley Walsh and Theo Collis. </p>

<p>Everyone involved with producers Michael Rose and Damien Sanders deserves a pat on the back, too, for putting on the musical version of Nora Ephron's romance movie. I found it touching. </p>

<p>How amazing to see a musical in 2020, inside a disease secure theatre. Thousands have been spent on health checks to keep cast, crew and audiences safe. Bravo. </p>

<p>I hope the rumours come to pass about David Hare's scorching monologue Beat The Devil being filmed, for viewing at some later date. </p>

<p>The play stars Ralph Fiennes, portraying Hare as he copes with the effects of Covid-19, while throwing the Prime Minister under a bus for his handling of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Beat The Devil is on at the Bridge as part of a season of one-person plays featuring a diverse array of artists.</p>

<p>I saw it last weekend. It was my first time back in a theatre and the Bridge's maintenance of Covid secure protocols was scrupulous, and very reassuring.</p>

<p>Movie fans are in for a well-deserved treat at the British Film Institute's London Film Festival.</p>
