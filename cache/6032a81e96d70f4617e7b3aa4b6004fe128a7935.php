<p>The police said they were unable to contact the children's father.</p>

<p>Marcel was with his mother on the train after the crime, local media reported, and headed on to his grandmother's house in Monchengladbach when his mother got off at Dusseldorf.</p>

<p>It was there at Dusseldorf Central Station that Christiane K. tried to kill herself before she was rescued from the tracks of the regional S-Bahn line.</p>

<p>Police said the children's grandmother alerted them to the tragedy at 2pm and ambulances rushed to the flat in Solingen. </p>

<p>Rescuers themselves were said to be traumatised by what they found in the building, and also shocked by the state of the flat. </p>

<p>Stefan Weiand, a police spokesman at the house, said it was a 'tragic situation' and added that the mother was not yet in a fit state to be questioned. </p>

<p>'We are assuming a crime was committed. How and why that happened, we cannot say,' he told broadcaster WDR. </p>

<p>One report said that rescuers had tried to resuscitate the children but arrived too late to save their lives.   </p>

<p>The bodies were discovered at an apartment building in Solingen, 20 miles from Cologne in western Germany</p>

<p>German railway operator DB said there were closures in Dusseldorf because an emergency doctor had been needed on the track.  </p>

<p>Authorities in nearby Wuppertal are investigating the children's deaths, with dozens of officers and a fleet of emergency vehicles outside the building.   </p>

<p>Jürgen Hardt, a member of the German parliament, said he had reacted in 'horror' when he heard the news of the children's deaths. </p>

<p>'I wish the emergency services and the police strength as they deal with the case, which will affect them deeply as well,' he said.  </p>
