<p>It comes as the newly-single Love Island star, 31, appeared on BBC Breakfast earlier in the day to discuss the proposed air-brushing ban.</p>

<p>Tory MP Dr Luke Evans has drawn up a Bill which would mean celebrities would have to label images which have been digitally altered to change how they look.</p>

<p>Hitting back: Laura Anderson continued to hit back at trolls on Saturday as she shared another makeup-free snap after sparking controversy with her 'changing face' earlier this week</p>

<p>Laura discussed the proposed ban, which claims edited photos on social media are 'fuelling a mental health crisis' and creating a 'warped view' of beauty.</p>

<p>During the interview, the reality star admitted that despite the fact she edits her own Instagram photos, she would be in favour for the Bill.</p>

<p>She said: 'At first, I wasn't 100% sure but now, honestly, I am all for it. I think it's great that we have choices, we all have our reasons for why we edit.</p>

<p>'Sometimes I edit just to save me some time. I ask friends why they edit, if they're not doing professional brand posts or things, they say it's a confidence thing.</p>

<p>Having her say: It comes as the newly-single Love Island star, 31, appeared on BBC Breakfast earlier in the day to discuss the proposed air-brushing ban</p>

<p>'I think we have to respect everyone's confidence journey, as long as we're honest about it.</p>

<p>'I know if I could see "edited", it would maybe stop me from editing as much. I think that's something positive in the future. I do think we over edit right now.'</p>

<p>Prior to her interview, Laura shared yet another defiant makeup-free snap after sparking controversy with her 'changing face' earlier this week. </p>

<p>In the picture, the reality star looked radiant as she showed her bare skin and styled her honey coloured locks into a high ponytail.</p>

<p>Hitting back: It comes after the star shared another makeup-free snap earlier this week and 'purposefully put no filter on'</p>

<p>'I didn't even recognise her!' Love Island fans claimed Laura looked 'unrecognisable' as she reunited with her co-stars for socially-distanced filming  on Tuesday (R in 2018)</p>

<p>Laura pouted to the camera and penned: 'Always go to bed with a dream and wake up with a purpose.' </p>

<p>It comes after the star shared another makeup-free snap earlier this week and 'purposefully put no filter on'.</p>

<p>Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George, said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.</p>

<p>'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse.</p>

<p>She said: 'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.' </p>

<p>'Like, "Laura doesn't look like Laura any more". It's really nice to read all those comments and I just think people need to get over the fact that a picture is just a picture. </p>

<p>'I wanted to come on here with no makeup on and I think I look fine, so thanks for the abuse. Anyway, positive love.'    </p>

<p> Laura hit back after social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance.</p>

<p>One wrote: 'OMG is that Laura !!!!!! I did not realise that was Laura!!!!! </p>

<p>Peace: Laura, who had been filming spin-off Where Are They Now? with Jack Fincham and Dr Alex George (pictured), said: 'I've purposefully put no filter on this.'</p>

<p>Another typed: 'That's not Laura!!! I didn't even recognise her!,' while a third chimed: 'wow laura doesn't even look like laura... is that even Laura....' (sic)</p>

<p>Another follower referenced the reality star's cosmetic procedures as they added: 'I don't even recognise Laura since her surgery. Shame she was so pretty and didn't need to change her appearance at all.' (sic)   </p>

<p>The media personality has made no secret of having Botox and lip fillers in the past - treatments she claimed she planned before entering the villa in 2018. </p>

<p>TV star previously told The Sun: 'I went for a place that I know does a natural look. I know there's a lot of young people that follow me and I don't want to promote anything like that as it's a dangerous topic really.</p>

<p>Stunned: Under the image shared to Jack's Instagram, social media users highlighted the blonde's dramatically 'different' appearance </p>

<p>'People have to feel good [inside] before they do all that I believe that but for me it's something I wanted to do for a really long time and I came out and just did it as I was thinking about it while I was in there.</p>

<p>'It's a touchy subject and I get that and I would never want to promote that to young girls, but I still want to live my life for me. It's hard, but I'm nearly 30.' </p>

<p>It's been a tough week for Laura as she announced she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom Brazier on Thursday just days after moving back to Scotland.    </p>

<p>Despite initially intending for hunky Tom to join her in Glasgow six months into her move, it now seems their romance is off.</p>

<p>'I got so much abuse': 'Yesterday I had such a good day filming with Jack and Alex and then Jack put up a picture of the three of us, which obviously is like, cute, but I got so much abuse'</p>

<p>The split appears to have been sudden, as Laura last posted a picture with the trainer just six days ago, a day before announcing she'd left London. </p>

<p>Stirling born Laura, 31, told fans on an Instagram story on Thursday: 'Thankyou for all the DMs asking about Tom and I since I moved up north. </p>

<p>'Unfortunately it hasn't worked out between us. In respect of Tom's privacy I won't be discussing this further. All my love to him and you all for continued support.' </p>

<p>Although the pair never revealed exactly when they met, the couple went public with their romance in May and spent lockdown together at Laura's London flat.    </p>

<p>It's OVER! It's been a tough week for Laura as she announced she had split from her fitness coach boyfriend Tom Brazier on Thursday just days after moving back to Scotland  </p>
