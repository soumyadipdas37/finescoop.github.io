<p>But Holliday Grainger appeared to take setting up a new family home in her stride, even with a pronounced baby bump.</p>

<p>The Capture star was spotted last week with boyfriend Harry Treadaway moving out of their three-bedroom flat in North London.</p>

<p>Holliday Grainger appeared to take setting up a new family home in her stride, even with a pronounced baby bump</p>

<p>Despite her pregnancy, 32-year-old Holliday happily mucked in, ferrying folders and bags from the property to a waiting removal lorry, a hefty bunch of keys around her neck.</p>

<p>At one point, she paused and cradled her bump while 36-year-old Harry, her partner of five years, packed their belongings, including artwork featuring him topless.</p>

<p>Holliday, who plays Detective Inspector Rachel Carey in The Capture, is expecting her first child early next year.</p>

<p>At one point, she paused and cradled her bump while 36-year-old Harry, her partner of five years, packed their belongings, including artwork featuring him topless</p>

<p>It is thought her pregnancy has stalled production of the second series of the popular crime drama, after it was announced in June that it had been recommissioned.</p>

<p>The actress is currently on our screens in the BBC1 series Strike: Lethal White, the four-part adaptation of J. K. Rowling’s detective books, written under the name Robert Galbraith. Holliday plays private detective Cormoran Strike’s assistant Robin Ellacott.</p>

<p>She also appeared as Lucrezia Borgias in The Borgias, a TV drama set in Renaissance-era Italy.</p>

<p>While she is famously tight-lipped about her romance with Harry, who played Princess Margaret’s toyboy Roddy Llewellyn in The Crown, she did once say that the pair enjoy spa weekends away and revealed that he collects heart-shaped pebbles for her.</p>

<p>His twin brother Luke is also an actor, currently starring in ITV epic The Singapore Grip, and the brothers have been making music together during the pandemic. The twins lived together until Luke married actress Ruta Gedmintas in 2017. His wife was in The Borgias TV mini-series in 2011 with Holliday and is one of her closest friends.</p>

<p>Holliday is also very close friends with Vanessa Kirby, who starred as Princess Margaret in The Crown, and Jenna Coleman, star of ITV’s Victoria.</p>

<p>The Mancunian actress made her name in 2012 when she played the leading role of Estella in Mike Newell’s film adaptation of Great Expectations, opposite Jeremy Irvine and Helena Bonham Carter.</p>

<p>She also played Lady Chatterley in a 2015 BBC adaptation of Lady Chatterley’s Lover.</p>

<p>The actress is currently on our screens in the BBC1 series Strike: Lethal White (pictured), the four-part adaptation of J. K. Rowling’s detective books, written under the name Robert Galbraith</p>
