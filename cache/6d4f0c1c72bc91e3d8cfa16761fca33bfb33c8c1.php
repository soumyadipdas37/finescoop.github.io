<p>The 19-year-old - who is a talented singer - is said to have been told bu BBC bosses that the singing career would need to be put on hold if she wanted to remain on EastEnders and take part in Strictly.</p>

<p>A source told The Sun: 'Maisie wants to crack the music industry and several labels think she is really marketable. One told her she could be the next Kylie, with her girl-next-door looks and down-to-earth personality.</p>

<p>Pop! EastEnders star Maisie Smith reportedly turned down a record deal so that she could take part on Strictly Come Dancing this year</p>

<p>'But she was told she could not take a record deal and continue on EastEnders and Strictly due to the BBC’s commercial rules.</p>

<p>'Maisie decided to take Strictly over the deal because she can revisit music after the show. This will give her an even bigger platform than EastEnders to show off her talents. She hopes it will be a huge chance for her.'</p>

<p>MailOnline has approached reps for comment. </p>

<p>She should be so lucky: The alleged deal promised to make her 'the next Kylie Minogue'</p>

<p>Earlier on Thursday, Maisie admitted that she has dancing experience ahead of appearing on the 2020 series of Strictly. </p>

<p>The soap actress also insisted that despite her prior dance knowledge she has no 'technical ability'.</p>

<p>It comes as it was revealed that she's trained in ballet and she even won the Children In Need special of Strictly with former pro Kevin Clifton in November 2019.</p>

<p>Talking on Thursday's This Morning, Maisie teased that she could be the 'dark horse' of the competition and also admitted to her dancing background.</p>

<p>Host Phillip Schofield grilled the EastEnders star about winning the Children In Need special of Strictly in November.</p>

<p>To which Maisie admitted: 'That was an absolute fluke. I'm not going to lie, I've got dancing experience. </p>

<p>'I've done a bit of hip-hop and street dance throughout my time but I have no technical ability at all. </p>

<p>Impressive! It comes as it was revealed that she's trained in ballet and she even won the Children In Need special of Strictly with former pro Kevin Clifton in November 2019</p>

<p>'So yeah I feel like I was very lucky on that week. But who knows, I could be the dark horse.'</p>

<p>Yet despite admitting to hip-hop and street dance experience, Maisie failed to mention that she is also trained in ballet.</p>

<p>In pictures shared to her Instagram in 2018, the soap star showed off her impressive barre skills and even likened herself to former judge and ballerina Darcey Bussell.</p>

<p>For one snap, Maisie impressively did the splits while wearing a black leotard in a dance studio.</p>

<p>Winner? Talking on Thursday's This Morning, Maisie teased that she could be the 'dark horse' of the competition and also admitted to her dancing background (pictured after winning Children In Need special of Strictly in November with former pro Kevin) </p>

<p>She captioned the photo with: 'Just call me Darcey Bussell [kiss emoji] (without the pointed feet).' </p>

<p>And in another snap, Maisie posed at a barre with her fiery red locks sweptback into a bun. She penned: 'Ballet is life (jks I suck).'</p>

<p>The actress also shared several videos of herself performing in hip-hop and street dance routines, where she showed off her impressive skills and even ended it by going into the splits.</p>

<p>Maisie and Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing were the latest celebs confirmed to be taking part in the 2020 series of Strictly Come Dancing on Thursday. </p>

<p>Talented! Yet despite admitting to hip-hop and street dance experience, Maisie failed to mention that she is also trained in ballet</p>

<p>Wow: In pictures shared to her Instagram in 2018, the soap star showed off her impressive barre skills and even likened herself to former judge and ballerina Darcey Bussell</p>

<p>Maisie can't wait to get started, telling the BBC: 'Get me in those sequins, I can't wait to dive into the Strictly fancy dress box this winter! This is a dream come true.'</p>

<p>She made her acting debut playing a young Elizabeth in feature film The Other Boleyn Girl alongside Scarlett Johansson and Eddie Redmayne. </p>

<p>That same year, Maisie stormed into Albert Square as Tiffany, daughter of Bianca and now member of the long established Butcher family. </p>

<p>Work it: The actress also shared several videos of herself performing in hip-hop and street dance routines, where she showed off her impressive skills and even ended it by going into the splits</p>

<p>Confirmed! Maisie and Made In Chelsea star Jamie Laing were the latest celebs confirmed to be taking part in the 2020 series of Strictly Come Dancing on Thursday </p>

<p>Maisie has won numerous awards for her portrayal of Tiffany including 'Best Dramatic Performance from a Young Actress' at the British Soap Awards and 'Best Young Actor' at the Inside Soap Awards.</p>

<p>As well as acting, Maisie has released two singles in 2016 and 2017 under an independent record label.  She hit headlines over the summer, when she was spotted smoking a 'strong-smelling' cigarette at the wheel of her car.</p>

<p>A furious source told The Sun of her Strictly signing before it was announced on Thursday: 'It is unthinkable that Strictly would sign her after the few weeks she has had. The show is the pinnacle of the BBC and gives rising stars and established ones a huge step to more fame.</p>

<p>Excitement: Maisie can't wait to get started, telling the BBC: 'Get me in those sequins, I can't wait to dive into the Strictly fancy dress box this winter! This is a dream come true.'</p>

<p>'So it's very weird to give someone whose future was very unclear just weeks ago such an opportunity. Perhaps they see it as a way of nailing down a rising star rather than her leaving and taking with her a young audience.'</p>

<p>She is reportedly still being investigated by BBC bosses - who were also left aggravated by her for allegedly signing a big money TikTok deal, despite being told not to by soap chiefs.</p>

<p>Maisie, who plays Tiffany Butcher in the soap, has apparently violated the terms of her EastEnders contract by inking a deal to promote musicians on the app.</p>
