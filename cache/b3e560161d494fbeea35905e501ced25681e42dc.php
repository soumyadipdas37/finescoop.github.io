<p>Stevie was last seen on August 9 as she left a Claridge Inn on South Bluff Street in St George, according to local police. </p>

<p>She was found in neighboring Iron County 14 days later, and authorities said her body had been there 'for some time'. </p>

<p>The Iron County Sheriff's Office said detectives are treating the case as a homicide but declined to offer any additional information as the investigation is ongoing.  </p>

<p>An autopsy is underway to determine the cause of death.  </p>

<p>Police have yet to make any arrests in the case and have asked anyone with information to contact the Iron County Sheriff's Office at 435-867-7500.</p>

<p>Officials have not commented publicly about the claims Vawna presented in her Facebook post after Stevie disappeared. </p>

<p>In the comments section of the post, Vawna expressed frustration with the investigation prior to Stevie's body being found.</p>

<p>'I don't think they are even doing anything,' she wrote on August 11. 'They quit keeping in touch with us yesterday...' </p>

<p>In another comment, Vawna claimed that the couple who took her daughter were wanted for kidnapping in other states. </p>

<p>She also wrote that the police, Stevie's boyfriend and staff at the hotel where she disappeared were refusing to give her descriptions of the people she claimed abducted her daughter.  </p>

<p>Police have asked anyone with information about Stevie's disappearance or death to contact the Iron County Sheriff's Office at 435-867-7500</p>

<p>Stevie's cousin, Angie Golish, expressed her heartbreak at the body discovery in an interview with the Deseret News.  </p>

<p>Golish described Stevie as an animal lover with 'a big heart, not a mean bone in her body'.</p>

<p>'She was just sweet and a little shy,' the cousin said. 'She was so kindhearted and loved all animals, big and small. She dreamed of being a veterinarian growing up.'   </p>

<p>'My aunt said it feels extra tragic that she would die this way because she was truly a person who wouldn't hurt anyone or anything,' Golish added in apparent reference to Vawna.   </p>

<p>Stevie worked as a quality control inspector at Megapro Screen Printing in St George, according to her Facebook profile.  </p>

<p>In her final post on June 26, she asked for help finding an apartment to rent with her boyfriend and dog, Niko.  </p>
