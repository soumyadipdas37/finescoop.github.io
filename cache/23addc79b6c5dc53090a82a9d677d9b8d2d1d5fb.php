<p>Manchester United have entered the race to sign wonderkid Alex Luna from Atletico Rafaela</p>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would be willing to allow Luna to stay in Argentina until January 2022</p>

<p>Luna netted 16 goals across 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic brought an end to the campaign in Argentina.  </p>

<p>It is believed that the youngster's impressive footwork and goalscoring threat have helped him become one of the world's most coveted prodigies. </p>

<p>Atletico Rafaela revealed they have already snubbed several loan offers for Luna from an array of unnamed potential suitors.</p>

<p>The forward is also due to join the club's senior team in Argentina's second tier next season after impressing in the levels below. </p>

<p>United are believed to be open to allowing Luna to remain in Argentina until the end of 2021 and would then introduce him to their ranks the following January. </p>

<p>Despite struggling to add to their first team, the Old Trafford giants have bought in several youngsters to improve their youth system.</p>

<p>Manchester United also signed fellow starlet Isak Hansen-Aaroen from Tromso this summer</p>

<p>Alvaro Fernandez Carreras, Marc Jurado and Isak Hansen-Aaoren have all been signed and will play for the club's academy teams this season.</p>

<p>Fernandez Carreras, 17, arrived from Real Madrid's Juvenil C team and is predominantly a left-sided full back. Jurado is a 16-year-old defender and played for Barcelona's Cadet A side before arriving in Manchester.</p>

<p>The highly-rated Hansen-Aaoren, also 16, joined from Norwegian side Tromso IL and made his professional debut for the club in July.   </p>
