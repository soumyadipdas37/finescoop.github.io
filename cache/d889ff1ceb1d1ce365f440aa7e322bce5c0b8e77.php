<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Some 84 per cent of Britons think dating for at least a year constitutes an 'established relationship', meaning they do not need to socially distance under new lockdown rules.</p>

<p>The latest government guidance issued this week does not provide clarity on what an 'established relationship' is, with many couples questioning if they fall into the category.</p>

<p>A survey by YouGov found 80 per cent think referring to a significant other as a 'partner' is enough to call things established.</p>

<p>A total of 84 per cent of those questioned think dating for a year or more awards them the title - while 72 per cent think six months or more is enough.</p>

<p>Two thirds - 66 per cent - found referring to someone as a 'boyfriend' or 'girlfriend' makes the relationship established, while 60 per cent said if you say you love them it does.</p>

<p>But just 17 per cent said it counted as established if the pair was having sex, falling to eight per cent for kissing.</p>

<p>Health Secretary Matt Hancock said people needed to 'be careful' when it came to having sexual relationships outside of 'established relationships' during the pandemic.</p>

<p>Asked about the Government's guidance that only 'established' couples should be having sex, he told Sky News: 'In these rules that we have to bring in, there have to be boundaries, to coin a phrase.</p>

<p>'If you're saying that two households shouldn't mix, which we are in some parts of the country - in the North East, the North West, in Scotland, in parts of Wales - then you have to then define what is the boundary of that.'</p>

<p>He added: 'I think we should stick to the letter of it, which is it is okay in an established relationship.</p>

<p>Asked about the Government's guidance that only 'established' couples should be having sex, he told Sky News: 'In these rules that we have to bring in, there have to be boundaries, to coin a phrase'</p>

<p>'It just means that people need to be careful, they need to be sensible.</p>

<p>'If you're in a relationship that is well established... what it means is people realising that coming into close contact with people from other households, then that is how the virus spreads.'</p>

<p>Mr Hancock joked to host Kay Burley that 'I know I am in an established relationship' with his wife.</p>

<p>In what is often seen as the first step to moving in with someone, leaving a toothbrush at the other person's house was seen by 51 per cent to be a sign of an established relationship.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the bold step of meeting a partner's parents was judged by just 42 per cent to mean a couple fits Mr Hancock's threshold.</p>

<p>Some viewers accused Ms Burley of flirting with the health secretary during their interview on yesterday.</p>

<p>The were both laughing while discussing casual sex in the context of the new coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p> One viewer tweeted: 'Jesus christ <?php echo e('@'); ?>KayBurley get a room! What unprofessional interviewing, more like a speed date than a serious interview on a major network at prime news time.'</p>

<p>Another added: 'She was like that yesterday with Raab, in fact if a man has a pulse, she's like that with them too. <?php echo e('@'); ?>KayBurley'.</p>

<p>'Vile!!' a third posted. 'How can he be that immature?' another added.</p>
