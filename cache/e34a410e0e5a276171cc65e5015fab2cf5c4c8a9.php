<p>‘He was in shock and in massive amounts of pain. He was outside in the courtyard in Malibu with Eric and Adam trying this new bike'  </p>

<p>They added: ‘Simon’s had to have a big surgery, he’s got a number of breaks and has had to have a metal rod put into his back.'</p>

<p>‘When he fell off the bike he landed right on his back which broke in a number of places. It was six hour surgery overnight on Saturday.’ </p>
