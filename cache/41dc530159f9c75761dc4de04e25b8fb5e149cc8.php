<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>John Edwards (pictured), 67, killed his daughter Jennifer, 13, and his son Jack, 15, in West Pennant Hills in Sydney's north-west on July 5, 2018</p>

<p>A lawyer acting for two children who were later shot dead by their evil father ignored their claims he had beaten them and labelled their mother a 'hard nosed bi***', an inquest has heard. </p>

<p>Edwards, 67, killed his daughter Jennifer, 13, and his son Jack, 15, in West Pennant Hills in Sydney's north-west on July 5, 2018.</p>

<p>Edwards then returned to his rented home in nearby Normanhurst and took his own life just hours after the cowardly attack.</p>

<p>Their murders came after a bitter custody dispute from March 2016 to February 2018 where a number of domestic abuse allegations were levelled at Edwards. </p>

<p>His estranged wife and the children's mother Olga, who won full custody on Valentine's Day 2018, died by suicide five months after the killings.</p>

<p>An inquest into the murders began at the NSW Coroners Court on Monday September 7 and Edwards' violent history was exposed.  </p>

<p>On Tuesday, the court heard from a family psychologist who previously advised the children's lawyer she feared Edwards was a dangerous narcissist, The Australian reported.</p>

<p>Edwards' estranged wife and the children's mother Olga, who won full custody on Valentine's Day 2018, died by suicide five months after the killings </p>

<p>The psychologist, who cannot be named for legal reasons, personally feared retribution from Edwards for even making the assessment.</p>

<p>The psychologist saw all members of the family between 2017 and 2018 amid the custody battle.</p>

<p>The two children told the psychologist they did not want to see their dad and detailed horrific living conditions when with their father.  </p>

<p>But the children's lawyer told the psychologist that the children's mother Olga presented as a 'hard nosed b*tch in court'. </p>

<p>The psychologist told the lawyer she didn't agree with the assessment, before making a note of the comment. </p>

<p>The psychologist felt the lawyer ignored the children's pleas to steer clear of their father.  </p>

<p>She said she had been misrepresented in emails claiming the teenagers would be taken from their mother if she didn't facilitate visits with their father. </p>

<p>The psychologist said that both Jack (pictured right) and Jennifer (pictured left) expressed their desire not to see their father in the lead up to their callous murders </p>

<p>'If I didn't feel they were safe enough to be in a joint session, how would I feel they would be safe living with him?' she said. </p>

<p>On one occasion Jack told her his father was often at the tipping point of physical rage.</p>

<p>Edwards had admitted to physical violence against his children including bending fingers back and a 'clip over the ear' but he denied allegations of more severe abuse.</p>

<p>He described Jennifer as his 'perfect little angel' in one session and tried to get Jack to go on a holiday with him before Olga, fearing for her son's safety, intervened.</p>

<p>The inquest continues. </p>
