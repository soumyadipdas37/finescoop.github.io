<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City are considering a move for Atletico Madrid defender Jose Gimenez as Pep Guardiola looks to sign another centre back before the transfer window closes.</p>

<p>City have been heavily linked with Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly and are maintaining an interest in the 29-year-old Senegal international.</p>

<p>But Gimenez, 25, is also on the list of targets drawn up by City with Guardiola keen to add a right-footed centre-back after signing Nathan Ake from Bournemouth for £41m. </p>

<p>Manchester City are monitoring Atletico Madrid defender Jose Gimenez as they eye signings</p>

<p>Reports in Spain on Monday claimed that City have had a £87million bid rejected by Atletico.</p>

<p>However, it's understood the Premier League have not made an offer for Gimenez or Koulibaly, and would not be prepared to pay that much for 25-year-old Uruguayan let alone the £110m buyout clause in his contract.</p>

<p>They will continue to pursue a number of options before the window closes on October 5 and are confident of adding to the signings of Ake and Valencia winger Ferran Torres for £20.8m.</p>

<p>Pep Guardiola is eyeing defensive reinforcements after his backline struggled last season</p>
