<p>Hungry bears have been breaking into a California gas station and a nearby supermarket and helping themselves to candy and crackers</p>

<p>Surveillance footage shows several incidents over the last three weeks where the wild creatures have headed inside a King's Beach gas station (pictured). In this video on August 12, a bear strolls through the door before a second - human - customer hits it on its backside</p>

<p>In one video back on August 12, a bear is seen casually strolling through the door of the gas station convenience store. </p>

<p>A second - human - customer follows close behind, before hitting the bear on its backside, sending it running back outside. </p>

<p>It seems news then spread of the tasty snacks on offer at the store as another bear headed to the store two weeks later on August 29.</p>

<p>Footage from that day shows the bear trying to enter the store only to be blocked by employee Paul Heigh, who tries to turn away the furry customer.  </p>

<p>Another bear heads to the gas station store on August 29 only to be blocked by employee Paul Heigh, who tries to turn away the furry customer</p>

<p>Heigh appears to point outside in an apparent gesture to the bear to leave - something the customer does not take too kindly to, lunging toward him and causing the worker to back away</p>

<p>The worker at the gas station told WKRN.com fending off the hungry scoundrels was 'not in the job description'</p>

<p>Heigh appears to point outside in an apparent gesture to the bear to leave - something the customer does not take too kindly to, lunging toward him and causing the worker to back away and let the bear enter.  </p>

<p>'It was kind of scary. Yeah, I'm not going to lie,' Heigh told WKRN.com.</p>

<p>'Not in the job description no…. not at all… fighting off bears was not in the job description.'</p>

<p>The following day, a bear is seen lying on the floor of one of the aisles stocking up on some 'bear' necessities.</p>

<p>The animal holds on to candy and crackers with his hands while he devours the tasty treats. </p>

<p>One of the same bears has also been spotted inside a nearby Safeway Supermarket perusing the fresh food aisles.</p>

<p>Ann Bryant of the Bear League said the organization is providing advice to the two stores on how to try to keep the hungry animals at bay. </p>

<p>'The bear should not be going into buildings where someone could shoot him or kill him or the department of wildlife could kill him,' Bryant told WKRN.com.   </p>
