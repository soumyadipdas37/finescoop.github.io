<p>Back in action: Honey I Shrunk The Kids star Rick Moranis returned to the spotlight this week in a new ad with Ryan Reynolds</p>

<p>His new ad comes seven months after Deadline revealed he is coming back to live-action cinema with a Honey I Shrunk The Kids sequel called Shrunk. </p>

<p>The Mint Mobile commercial shows Rick and Ryan in a field that they appear to have been digitally edited into, in keeping with coronavirus safety protocols.</p>

<p>'It's hard to believe that Mint Mobile has gone so long without an unlimited plan, so to introduce it, we brought in an actor we've all gone too long without - Rick Moranis,' says Ryan cuing his fellow actor to walk into the frame.</p>

<p>After plugging the phone plan Ryan bashfully tells Rick he is 'just a huge fan,' and Rick modestly says: 'Oh, stop it.'</p>

<p>Stepping back: Rick, 67, gradually withdrew from the movies to focus on raising his children after his wife Ann Belsky died of breast cancer in 1991</p>

<p>Back at it: However amid his 23-year hiatus from live-action films he has appeared onscreen with Ryan in a Mint Mobile commercial</p>

<p>Making it happen: The Mint Mobile commercial shows Rick and Ryan in a field that they appear to have been digitally edited into, in keeping with coronavirus safety protocols</p>

<p>'No, seriously, massive,' says Ryan, prompting Rick to wait from him to continue before becoming somewhat nonplussed and saying: 'That's it?'</p>

<p>'That's it,' says Ryan, to which Rick stares out at the audience in bemusement, before waving at his co-star and walking away.</p>

<p>Ann, a costume designer, had been married to Rick for five years when she died at the age of 34, leaving him to look after their children Rachel and Mitchell. </p>

<p>Rick was previously very active in Hollywood and had three films out in 1989 alone - Honey I Shrunk The Kids, Ghostbusters II and Parenthood.</p>

<p>On cue: Ryan said that 'we brought in an actor we've all gone too long without - Rick Moranis' prompting his co-star to walk onscreen</p>

<p>So sweet: After plugging the phone plan Ryan bashfully tells Rick he is 'just a huge fan,' and Rick modestly says: 'Oh, stop it'</p>

<p>Flummoxed: 'No, seriously, massive,' says Ryan, prompting Rick to wait from him to continue before becoming somewhat nonplussed and saying: 'That's it?'</p>

<p>Off he goes: 'That's it,' says Ryan, to which Rick stares out at the audience in bemusement, before waving at his co-star and walking away</p>

<p>However when he became a single father he phased himself out though he continued with the Honey I Shrunk The Kids franchise.</p>

<p>Honey I Blew Up The Kid came out in 1992 and Rick's latest live-action movie Honey We Shrunk Ourselves was released direct to video in 1997.</p>

<p>Since then he did not leave showbiz entirely, releasing the tongue-in-cheek country album The Agoraphobic Cowboy in 2005 and another record called My Mother's Brisket And Other Love Songs eight years later.</p>

<p>He also voice acted sporadically in both Brother Bear movies and a direct-to-video release called Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer And The Island Of Misfit Toys. </p>

<p>Star turn: Rick was previously very active in Hollywood and had three films out in 1989 alone including Honey I Shrunk The Kids which he is pictured in with Marcia Strassman</p>

<p>Throwback: Ann and Rick had been married five years when she died at the age of 34, leaving him to look after their children Rachel and Mitchell, whom he is seen with in 1989</p>

<p>The way they were: Ann, a costume designer, had been married to Rick for five years when she died at the age of 34; they are pictured together at the 1990 Oscars</p>
