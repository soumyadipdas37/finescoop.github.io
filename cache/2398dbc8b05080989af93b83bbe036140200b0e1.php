<p>'It's okay, it's just a representation of the Universe, Golden Plaque from the Voyager (google search, pretty amazing) nature and animals, mother nature being destroyed, religion, aliens, all that kinda weird stuff,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Also about religion shooting down any ideas of other life in the Universe. I'm weird.' </p>
