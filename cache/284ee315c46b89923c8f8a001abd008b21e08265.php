<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A gambling addict who conned almost $800,000 from businessmen she met on Tinder and gave deadly threats to her victims' families has been jailed for four years.</p>

<p>Jocelyn Zakhour, 41, had been living as a VIP member in Melbourne's Crown Casino when she falsely told two men she needed money to invest into a blueberry and tobacco farm in NSW.</p>

<p>Between June and November in 2018, Zakhour managed to swindle more than $780,00 from both of her victims.</p>

<p>She eventually pleaded guilty to multiple fraud, blackmail and extortion charges and on Tuesday cried when she was jailed for a maximum of four years and six months with a non-parole period of two years and eight months.</p>

<p>Jocelyn Zakhour has been jailed after fleecing more than $780,000 from businessmen she met on Tinder</p>

<p>The County Court heard how Zakhour managed to fleece the men including telling them she needed cash for her employees, The Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>Zakhour managed to swindle $728,700 from her first victim after promising him a 300 per cent return for his investment into the fake farm.</p>

<p>She also gifted him with a fake Rolex to ensure what she was doing wasn't a 'scam'.</p>

<p>He initially transferred her $200,000 but was forced to give her more after Zakhour said 'the employees would find him and his family and harm them'.</p>

<p>'Tell your ex-wife you will kill yourself if she doesn't give you the money,' she said. </p>

<p>Zakhour also told the victim to take money out of his super and if he didn't workers would 'come to Melbourne and do something to him and his family'.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old threatened her victims and their families if they did not continue to pay her</p>

<p>The serial gambler also sent out 240 threatening emails to her first victim before she was eventually reported to police in November, 2018</p>

<p>The first man eventually reported Zakhour to police in November, 2018 after she sent him 240 emails threatening his ex-wife, children and even his mother.</p>

<p>Detectives swooped on Zakhour after one of her victims arranged to meet up with her at a restaurant.</p>

<p>The 41-year-old told police she regretted blowing all the money on pokies and baccarat at the casino, adding her victim 'knew what type of girl I am'. </p>

<p>'The thing that's killing me is I did nothing with the money, I could have brought the biggest business, I didn't even buy myself a car, not even property, nothing to show for it,' Zakhour said.</p>

<p>'I don't feel sorry for him, how can you be so stupid to believe those stories.'</p>

<p>Her second victim, a financial planner, was conned into paying her $61,000 which she said would go towards farm equipment and staff wages.</p>

<p>She lived large as a VIP member of the Crown Casino and even gambled away $24million between 2016 and 2018</p>

<p>It was also heard that Zakhour had been held hostage by a man in Syria who then forced her family to pay up $400,000 in order to let her go.</p>

<p>This resulted in Zakhour gambling heavily in a bid to pay her parents back.</p>

<p>She lived as a VIP member of the Crown Casino and even gambled away $24million between 2016 and 2018.</p>

<p>She said her high-rolling lifestyle gave her a sense of 'power'.</p>

<p>Judge Gregory Lyon said the fraudster had 'ruthlessly exploited' her victims and ruined their lives and ability to trust others.</p>

<p>Zakhour wrote an apology letter to her victims, spent the past 18 months volunteering at a soup kitchen, and paid back her victims about 10 per cent of what they had lost. </p>

<p>She sobbed in court upon being sentenced to jail. </p>
