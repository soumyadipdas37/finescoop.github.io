<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An online gaming addict said watching child porn every day made him 'feel good'. </p>

<p>Troy Hyman, 37, known as 'Batman' to his friends was arrested at his home he shares with his mother in Lalor, in Melbourne's north, in March, 2018.</p>

<p>After banging down his door, police found several devices including phones, a laptop and computers which combined stored 29,746 images and videos of child porn.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old admitted to watching the pornography everyday for six years and said most of the children were between eight and ten-years-old but were 'smiling'. </p>

<p>On Wednesday the former security guard pleaded guilty in the County Court to accessing and possessing child abuse material.</p>

<p>Troy Hyman, 37, was arrested at his home he shares with his mother in Lalor in Melbourne's north in March, 2018</p>

<p>Hyman was caught after investigators from a specialist child abuse unit linked his IP address to an online peer-to-peer network that had been sharing child sexual material, the Herald Sun reported.</p>

<p>He said he knew what he was doing was wrong but continued anyway, telling police it made him 'feel good'.</p>

<p>The court heard that Hyman had eventually become 'desensitised' to the material.</p>

<p>His barrister described him as an 'introvert' who had become caught up in the world of online gaming.</p>

<p>The 37-year-old said most of the children in the videos were aged between eight and ten-years-old</p>

<p>'(He) goes from adult pornography to more risqué pornography to utterly illegal pornography,' his barrister said.</p>

<p>'He's actually really shy … he's not equipped to deal with … real women.'</p>

<p>Hyman had a 'perfectly normal' upbringing in Melbourne and went on to finish a health studies course at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, the court heard.</p>

<p>He will be sentenced at a later date and will be registered as a sex offender for 15 years.</p>
