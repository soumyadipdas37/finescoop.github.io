<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City are working on landing a left back before Monday's transfer deadline, but a move is dependent on Aleks Zinchenko's future.</p>

<p>Sportsmail revealed last month that Pep Guardiola still had his sights on two players to bolster his ranks following their ambitious bid to sign Lionel Messi.</p>

<p>Ruben Dias has agreed a £64.3million switch from Benfica to add more physicality to the central defensive area – but Guardiola wants more by way of another full back.</p>

<p>Manchester City are interested in signing another left back before Monday's transfer deadline</p>

<p>But City's transfer decision is dependent on 23-year-old Aleks Zinchenko's (above) future</p>

<p>The manager believes a freshening up of personalities in his squad could contribute to an uplift on last year's disappointing campaign. David Silva, Claudio Bravo and Leroy Sane preceded Nicolas Otamendi's departure to Benfica for £13.7m.</p>

<p>City already possess Benjamin Mendy and Zinchenko at left back, while £41m summer signing Nathan Ake can also operate there if required, and need to offload one if they are to bring in a new face.</p>

<p>There was contact with Bayern Munich surrounding David Alaba's situation last year. City are also credited with interest in Ajax's Argentina international Nicolas Tagliafico.</p>

<p>Both are 28 years old and would fit the criteria recently laid out by chairman Khaldoon Al Mubarak, who revealed that the club was looking at more experienced players.</p>

<p>City have Benjamin Mendy (above) and new signing Nathan Ake can operate at left back</p>

<p>Nonetheless, City have been linked with Zinchenko and Ajax's Argentinian Nicolas Tagliafico</p>

<p>Alaba has a year left to run on his current contract at the Allianz Arena. Sources in Holland indicated a sizeable offer would need to be made if Ajax were to part with Tagliafico.</p>

<p>The Dutch champions have already lost Donny van der Beek and Hakim Ziyech over the last few months, with right back Sergino Dest edging closer to joining Barcelona.</p>

<p>Zinchenko, whose wife was forced to apologise after criticising Guardiola amid the calamitous Champions League exit last month, has had suitors in the past.</p>

<p>Wolves bid £16m for the Ukraine international two years ago but he opted to fight for his place, making a similar decision when Real Betis registered interest.</p>
