<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>She has kept her baby girl's name a secret for the past week.</p>

<p>But on Tuesday, radio host Ash Pollard shared all the details of her newborn's unexpected arrival.</p>

<p>'I went in for a vaginal birth and I ended up having an emergency C-section. It was an absolute ordeal,' she told Hit NSW Breakfast's Gawndy and Maz.</p>

<p>Lovely! Ash Pollard has revealed the name of her baby daughter: Clementine Abigail Ferne. Pictured after giving birth last week</p>

<p>'I had to be induced, which means they technically induce your body to make you go into labour and then that wasn't working,' she added. </p>

<p>'I was in labour for two days.' </p>

<p>The 34-year-old revealed she felt emotionless and spaced out when Clementine Abigail Ferne arrived on September 21 because she 'was on so many drugs'.</p>

<p>Ash said that she and her partner, Pete Ferne, had decided on the name after considering several options, which included 'Fergus' for a boy.</p>

<p>'It's real... I promise!' she laughed when asked about the unusual name suggestion.</p>

<p>Parents: The 34-year-old (pictured with her partner, Pete Ferne) said she felt emotionless and spaced out when Clementine arrived on September 21 because she 'was on so many drugs'</p>

<p>'Do you know what the craziest thing is... you don't have to think of a name for your child for 60 days,' she added. </p>

<p>Ash also revealed that she did not cry when Clementine was born, but Pete did.</p>

<p>He was by her side from the very start of the 48-hour labour, even though he felt 'helpless' in the situation.</p>

<p>'You know what's funny... no matter how much a guy reads a book or their mates tell them about something, you will just feel so helpless,' she said.</p>

<p>Difficult birth: Ash's partner was by her side from the very start of the 48-hour labour, even though he felt 'helpless' in the situation</p>

<p>'Pete was doing all the right things but when you're in the middle of labour and having these contractions that are so effing hectic, you can't do anything.'</p>

<p>The only thing Pete was able to do for Ash was cut the umbilical cord when Clementine finally arrived.</p>

<p>'I shouted over the curtain that separates me and my operation, "Have you sewn me up yet? Put me back together and get me out of here!"' Ash laughed.</p>

<p>Out and about: The couple have spent the past week settling into parenthood, with Ash taking her baby girl for a stroll near their home on the NSW Central Coast on Monday</p>

<p>The outing came just hours after viewers watched the former MKR star bare all for a good cause on The All New Monty: Guys &amp; Gals on Sunday night.</p>

<p>The burlesque show, which was filmed at Sydney's Enmore Theatre in March, raised awareness of early detection and prevention of cancer.</p>

<p>It was filmed about the same time Ash discovered she was pregnant.</p>

<p>Baring all: Just hours earlier, viewers had watched Ash (left, with Danielle Spencer) strip off on The All New Monty to raise awareness of early detection and prevention of cancer</p>
