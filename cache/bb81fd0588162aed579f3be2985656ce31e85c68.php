<p>David Dimbleby has described Dominic Cummings as 'a machine gun' prepared to 'massacre' British institutions like the BBC and judiciary</p>

<p>'There is something obnoxious about him,' he added. 'He's like a machine gun. Remember the Battle of Omdurman. </p>

<p>'The army just massacred a whole row of people on top of the hill and you feel like that at the moment.</p>

<p>'It's not that easy to dismantle things, shrinking the BBC, getting rid of all the senior people in the civil service, attacking the judiciary. </p>

<p>'It is the Bash Street Kids but to what end?'</p>

<p>The former Question Time host also took aim at 'arrogant' Boris Johnson, saying 'a strong-willed prime minister' does not depend on 'powers behind the throne' like Mr Cummings</p>

<p>He also said politicians these days shy away from scrutiny and think 'what's in it for me?'.</p>

<p>'To say when you get to the top, ''I am not going to be interviewed'', like Boris Johnson did at the last election, is so arrogant… it doesn't make you a shrewd operator. </p>

<p>'It erodes the democratic process.'</p>
