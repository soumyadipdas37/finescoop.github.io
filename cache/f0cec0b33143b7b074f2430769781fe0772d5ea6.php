<p>Kayla (pictured) explained that she likes the simple dish, because it's 'full of fresh vegetables' but also has some rice and tuna in it, which fill her up and give her energy throughout the day</p>

<p>'I don't really measure anything, but if you want to make it you'll need a handful of cherry tomatoes, half an avocado, around a quarter of a cucumber, red onion, a can of tuna and half a cup of rice,' Kayla said.</p>

<p>'I add a drizzle of balsamic glaze, a drizzle of oil and some salt and cracked pepper and throw everything into a bowl and it's ready to eat.</p>

<p>'It literally takes five minutes to make!' she added. </p>

<p>The 29-year-old (pictured) typically has two breakfasts - usually some eggs on toast and a green tea before training and then some fruit and yoghurt and a coffee after training</p>

<p>Kayla typically uses brown rice as it has more complex carbohydrates than white rice and so it will keep you fuller for longer.</p>

<p>She also said that vegetarians and vegans could substitute the tuna out for chickpeas, tofu or eggs if they eat them instead.</p>

<p>Thousands who saw the simple recipe were impressed with it, and said they couldn't wait to try it for themselves.</p>

<p>'This is my go to lunch as well! The only difference is I add lemon juice and chilli flakes,' one woman wrote. </p>

<p>'This looks delicious!' another added. </p>

<p>Lunch for Kayla (pictured) is usually something like the tuna and rice dish or some form of carbs and some protein, while dinner is the same: quality protein and a small portion of carbs</p>

<p>Kayla (pictured) said if she is craving sugar, she often has a cup of tea as she says many confuse hunger with boredom</p>

<p>When it comes to the rest of her day on a plate, Kayla's diet is similarly health-focused, but also delicious.</p>
