<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Manchester City are sending a trio of young talents to sister club Girona on loan for the season.</p>

<p>Aro Muric, Yan Couto and Pablo Moreno are all expected to join the Spanish second division side in the coming days.</p>

<p>Moreno has a burgeoning reputation after signing from Juventus over the summer as part of an academy recruitment drive at City.</p>

<p>Moreno (above) has a burgeoning reputation after signing from Juventus over the summer</p>

<p>The 18-year-old is capped at youth level for Spain and can play anywhere across the front three.</p>

<p>City are hopeful of developing all three players into challenging for a first-team berth in the future, although the move to Girona is of more immediate significance to Muric.</p>

<p>The Kosovo international endured a difficult loan spell at Nottingham Forest last year, dropping out of the team after just four Championship games.</p>

<p>Full-back Couto signed from Coritiba in July with City beating Barcelona to his signature</p>

<p>Muric had a previous loan spell at NAC Breda cut short following a serious knee injury suffered by Claudio Bravo at the beginning of the 2018-19 campaign.</p>

<p>The 21-year-old was impressive during City’s run to winning the Carabao Cup that season but now needs consistent games.</p>

<p>Couto is a full back signed from Coritiba in Brazil for around £5million in July as City beat Barcelona to the 18-year-old’s signature.</p>
