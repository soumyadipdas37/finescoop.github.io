<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Luis Suarez has been asked by new Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman to train on his own as he prepares to leave the LaLiga club for Juventus. </p>

<p>The Uruguayan forward is in talks with the Spanish club to terminate his contract, which expires in 2021, after six successful years at the Camp Nou. </p>

<p>According to Spanish news outlet Marca, Suarez has reportedly agreed a £9million salary with the Serie A champions in a move that would see him link-up with Cristiano Ronaldo in Turin.</p>

<p>Barcelona boss Ronald Koeman (above) has told Juventus-bound Suarez he has no future there</p>

<p>And several reports, including ESPN, have claimed that the striker is training away from the first-team group alongside Arturo Vidal and another fitness coach while his future gets resolved. </p>

<p>Suarez posted an image of him training with Barcelona on his Instagram story with the caption, 'Professional', implying that he will remain dedicated to the LaLiga club while he remains a player there. </p>

<p>The forward's proposed £9million salary in Italy will see him receive a lower wage compared to what he currently earns at Barcelona, though the 33-year-old is expected to earn additional sums in bonuses and image rights payments.   </p>

<p>The 33-year-old is the third-highest goalscorer in Barcelona's history with 198 to his name - despite only joining the Catalans six years ago. </p>

<p>Yet new boss Koeman has refused to include him in his plans for next season and is set to depart the club alongside Vidal - who has been strongly linked with a move to Inter Milan. </p>

<p>Suarez was reportedly told by the Dutch manager that his services are no longer required in a one-minute phone call which left the Uruguayan stunned.</p>

<p>The Uruguayan forward, who joined in 2014 is third on Barcelona's all-time goalscorers list</p>

<p>The striker was also upset at the radio silence by club president Josep Maria Bartomeu over his future, with Barcelona fans already upset at their own chief over the way he has handled Lionel Messi's transfer saga. </p>

<p>During his time at the Camp Nou, Suarez has won four LaLiga titles, four Spanish Cups along with the Champions League and Club World Cup titles in 2015. He originally joined the Catalans for a £65million from Liverpool in 2014.</p>
