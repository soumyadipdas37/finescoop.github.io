<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Miranda Lambert was Nashville chic as she attended the ACM Awards this Wednesday in the capital of country music.</p>

<p>The 36-year-old posed up a storm with her Music Event Of The Year trophy which she won for her 2019 cover of Fooled Around And Fell In Love.</p>

<p>She also took the stage at the iconic Bluebird Cafe during the show to give a minimalist rendition of her ballad Bluebird. </p>

<p>Aglow: Miranda Lambert was Nashville chic as she attended the ACM Awards this Wednesday in the capital of country music</p>

<p>While standing onstage she sang that the 'stripped-down version' of the number reflected 'basically the way we wrote this song.'</p>

<p>Miranda also gave a tip of the hat to how well-chosen the song was for that particular venue, introducing her performance as 'Bluebird at the Bluebird.'</p>

<p>Bluebird is a cut off her 2019 album Wildcard which also includes the duet Way Too Pretty For Prison with Maren Morris. </p>

<p>The country blonde hit the stage in a gleaming blue top with all the right touches, including country fringe and bluebird embroidery on the shoulders.</p>

<p>Radiant: The 36-year-old posed up a storm with her Music Event Of The Year trophy which she won for her 2019 cover of Fooled Around And Fell In Love</p>

<p>Sweeping her hair into an elegant updo, she sharpened her screen siren features with makeup and added some extra dazzle with hoop earrings.</p>

<p>Even her skintight dark jeans featured bluebird embroidery down the outer sides of the legs leaving no mystery as to which number she would perform. </p>

<p>Fooled Around And Fell In Love is originally a 1970s song by Elvin Bishop but Miranda sang it as an ensemble piece last year with a group of country ladies.</p>

<p>She was joined by Maren, Ashley McBryde, Tenille Townes, Caylee Hammack, Elle King who have all supported her on her Roadside Bars And Pink Guitars Tour.</p>

<p>History: Fooled Around And Fell In Love is originally a 1970s song by Elvin Bishop but Miranda sang it as an ensemble piece last year with a group of country ladies</p>

<p>Meanwhile for her awards show performance of Bluebird she was joined by a backup performer and musicians but full social distance was maintained onstage. </p>

<p>The awards show extravaganza blends live and pre-taped segments and be held across three Nashville landmarks, facilitating social distancing.</p>

<p>One of the venues was the Bluebird Cafe where Miranda performed and the others were the Grand Ole Opry and Ryman Auditorium. </p>

<p>During the same show Miranda's ex-husband Blake Shelton sang with his current blonde love Gwen Stefani at a Bluebird Cafe replica they made in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>What a lineup: She was joined by Maren, Ashley McBryde, Tenille Townes, Caylee Hammack, Elle King who have all supported her on her Roadside Bars And Pink Guitars Tour</p>

<p>Blake and Gwen became a sizzling public item near the end of 2015 just a few months after he and Miranda announced and finalized their divorce.</p>

<p>Miranda has already won 27 ACM Awards and is up for two more this year along with the Music Event Of The Year prize she already won.</p>

<p>Wildcard is up for album of the year against new offerings by Maren as well as country music heartthrobs Luke Combs, Thomas Rhett and Jon Pardi.</p>

<p>She is also facing off for female artist of the year in a formidable category that includes Maren, Carrie Underwood, Kelsea Ballerini and Kacey Musgraves.</p>

<p>Looking fab: The country blonde hit the stage in a gleaming blue top with all the right touches, including country fringe and bluebird embroidery on the shoulders</p>
