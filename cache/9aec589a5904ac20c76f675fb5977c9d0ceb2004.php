<p>The Australian Government processed 140,366 permanent arrivals last year, with Indians topping the list at 26,000 citizens, followed by 18,587 from China. </p>

<p>More than 10,600 UK citizens, 8,960 from the Philippines and 5,398 Vietnamese  people were granted permanent visas. </p>

<p>New South Wales took in the most new migrants with 44,182 settlers, followed by 34,189 in Victoria, 18,743 in Queensland, 11,996 in South Australia and 11,377 in WA</p>

<p>Most of the Nepalese migrants are believed to be former students who have been granted permanent skilled visas while still living in Australia.    </p>

<p>The migration program delivered 95,843 skilled places, including 29,261 sponsored by employer.</p>

<p>India - 26,000</p>

<p>China - 18,578</p>

<p>UK - 10,681</p>

<p>Philippines - 8,965</p>

<p>Nearly 42,000 visas were given for family migration, 37,118 of which were taken by the partners of Australians.</p>

<p>New South Wales took in the most new migrants with 44,182 settlers, followed by 34,189 in Victoria, 18,743 in Queensland, 11,996 in South Australia and 11,377 in WA. </p>

<p>Australian Population Research Institute director Dr Bob Birrell said the federal government at the time of the 2019-20 budget set a maximum of 160,000.</p>

<p>'But since 2016-17 the program has been regarded as a ceiling, not a target,' he told The Daily Telegraph. </p>

<p>'The Coalition has clearly decided that high migration in Covid-19 circumstances was not a good idea, and accordingly have reduced the number of visas issued in both the skill and the family components below the program level. This is a sensible decision.'</p>

<p>Immigration Minister Alan Tudge said two in three permanent visas were granted to people already in Australia who transitioned from a temporary to permanent visa. </p>

<p>'There were also 13,171 visas granted in the humanitarian program in 2019-20, including 4765 visas (45 per cent) for those who were referred for settlement in regional areas,' he said. </p>
