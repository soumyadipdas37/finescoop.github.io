<p>She's off: With the dust settling on a very different Venice Film Festival it was a stylish Cate Blanchett who bid farewell to the picturesque Italian city for another year on Sunday</p>

<p>In accordance with current safety guidelines the actress covered her instantly recognisable features with a face mask while making her way to the airport.</p>

<p>The previous evening Cate, who served on this year's Venice jury, joined the celebrations as  US-produced Nomadland won the coveted Golden Lion prize.</p>

<p>The film - directed by Chinese-born Chloé Zhao - stars Oscar winner Frances McDormand as a widow who lives as a nomad after the 2008 economic crisis.</p>

<p>Looking good: The Australian actress, 51, caught the eye in a check blazer and skinny leather trousers as she left her hotel following the festival's closing ceremony the previous evening</p>

<p>Cate explained that the winner had been chosen are 'healthy and robust', with star Frances accepting the award via. Zoom.</p>

<p>The 77th edition of the Venice Film Festival was also the first live event since the COVID-19 pandemic began to introduce a live audience, though all guests were required to wear masks and only half of the seats in the venues were used to ensure social distancing.</p>

<p>New Order - directed by Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco - and Wife of a Spy - which was brought to life by Japan's Kiyoshi Kurosawa - were awarded with Silver Lions.</p>

<p>Well done: The previous evening Cate, who served on this year's Venice jury, joined the celebrations as US-produced Nomadland won the coveted Golden Lion prize</p>

<p>Franco's work also received the Grand Jury prize, while Russian director Andrei Konchalovsky was awarded with the Special Jury prize for his period film Dear Comrades!, about the massacre of protesters in the USSR in 1962.</p>

<p>Cate's outing comes after she revealed she prefers to be referred to as an actor than an actress, as she often found the latter term to be used in a 'pejorative sense'.</p>

<p>Throwing her support behind Berlin International Film Festival's new plan to do away with gendered awards, she told AFP: 'I have always referred to myself as an actor.</p>

<p>'I am of the generation where the word actress was used almost always in a pejorative sense. So I claim the other space.'</p>
