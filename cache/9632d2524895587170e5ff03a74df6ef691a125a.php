<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Alessandra Ambrosio put her supermodel physique on full display, as she posed up a storm in a black push-up bra and a $450 pair of Burberry underwear on Tuesday. </p>

<p>As the 39-year-old former Victoria's Secret Angel showcased her ample cleavage in a bustier, she leaned back on a cement wall with her chocolate mane cascading past her shoulders.  </p>

<p>While seductively smoldering at the camera, she slightly cocked her eyebrows and pursed her plump pout.  </p>

<p>You are constantly creating who you are ✨</p>

<p>In the majority of snaps, photographed by Greg Swales, Ambrosio posed with her mouth slightly agape and flashing plenty of her sun-kissed skin.  </p>

<p>At one point, the Brazilian-born beauty stretched out on the floor with her toes pointed toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>'You are constantly creating who you are,' the mother-of-two captioned the sultry slideshow of herself. </p>

<p>The stunner sounded like she had a blast during the shoot, as her photographer joked the images were a 'break' from her 'stretching/dancing' on set. </p>

<p>In response to the pictures Swales uploaded of her on his personal Instagram account, Ambrosio commented she was 'loving our pics' with a red heart emoji. </p>

<p>Swales replied that she was a 'dream' to work with and a 'heavenly angel.'</p>

<p>Shifting into the vibration of love. ¿¿¿¿¿¿</p>

<p>In another shot, the proud mom can be seen standing on one foot with her right arm reaching above her head, while standing between her two children. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Anja opted to pose stretching out on floor in front of her mom, as her brother did a semi-split. </p>
