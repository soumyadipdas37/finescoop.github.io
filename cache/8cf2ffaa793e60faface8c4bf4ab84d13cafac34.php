<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A New Jersey nurse who shot and killed her husband before dumping his remains in the Chesapeake Bay has insisted she is innocent in a rare interview behind bars, 13 years after her conviction. </p>

<p>Melanie McGuire, 47, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 after she was found guilty of murdering husband Bill McGuire, 39, at their Woodbridge apartment in 2004. </p>

<p>Prosecutors said McGuire, who was 31 at the time, used her expertise as a nurse to drug Bill before shooting him, dismembering his body and stuffing it into designer suitcases. </p>

<p>Melanie McGuire spoke to ABC's 20/20 in a rare interview behind bars that aired this week</p>

<p>McGuire was sentenced to murdering husband Bill McGuire in 2004, but she maintains she's innocent and the killer remains at large </p>

<p>McGuire spoke out for the first time since she was jailed in an interview with ABC's 20/20 from Edna Mahan Correctional Facility in Clinton, revealing she is fighting to turn over her conviction.</p>

<p>'I'm doing this because there's a murderer walking around,' she said. 'The killer is out there and it's not me.'</p>

<p>'After all these years, I still feel hurt. I still feel bothered. Like, how could somebody think that I did that?' </p>

<p>During her trial, McGuire was revealed to be having an affair with a doctor from her medical practice, which the prosecution believed was the motive behind killing her husband.</p>

<p>McGuire and the defense however, had argued Bill had developed a gambling addiction and was killed over unpaid debts.   </p>

<p>During her trial, McGuire was revealed to be having an affair, allowing prosecutors to establish a motive </p>

<p>She claimed Bill had asked her to purchase a gun for him since a previous felony conviction did not allow him to buy one, two days before he disappeared. </p>

<p>McGuire told Robach that the time was a 'coincidence.' </p>

<p>'However, he was on me for a while about that, about trying to get that. And if something was happening, if he was in some sort of trouble, that may very well have been the reason why he was so intent on getting it,' she said. </p>
