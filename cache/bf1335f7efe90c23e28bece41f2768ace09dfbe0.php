<p>But Miley Cyrus got to be her own director on Wednesday night as she took nude mirror selfies that she posted to Instagram. </p>

<p>Bare: Miley Cyrus got to be her own director on Wednesday night as she took nude mirror selfies that she posted to Instagram </p>

<p>The Wrecking Ball singer seemed to not have on an inch of clothing as she perfectly posed and used her arms and phone to cover any private parts. </p>

<p>She posed in front of a blue piece of art as she snapped the pictures she captioned 'bisous,' which is French for 'kiss.' </p>

<p>Miley left her blonde mullet haircut in a spikey and messy look, and with a red band lifting a back portion straight into the air. </p>

<p>She seemed to have her makeup fully done for the stripped down snaps as her eyes were covered in gold and she had a bright red pout. </p>

<p>Bold eye and lip: She seemed to have her makeup fully done for the stripped down snaps as her eyes were covered in gold and she had a bright red pout </p>

<p>Spiked: Miley left her blonde mullet haircut in a spikey and messy look, and with a red band lifting a back portion straight into the air </p>

<p>Leaning onto the counter, she rested on her forearms, with tattoos on her torso in short and her legs seemed bare though her pose hid areas perfectly.  </p>

<p>Earlier this month, Miley spoke out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the recent MTV Video Music Awards.</p>

<p>The Midnight Sky singer made the claim during her chat with Joe Rogan on his Joe Rogan Experience podcast, detailing the incident. </p>

<p>She began explaining how she'd requested for the lights to be turned off during her performance - including a 'beauty light' used specifically for female performers - which ruffled some feathers with a director. </p>

<p>Perfect pose: Leaning onto the counter, she rested on her forearms, with tattoos on her torso in short and her legs seemed bare though her pose hid areas perfectly </p>

<p>Technical difficulties: Earlier this month, Miley spoke out about a sexist experience she endured with one of the directors of her performance at the recent MTV Video Music Awards</p>

<p>'I was just asking some questions, not even on some diva s****,' she said, saying: 'I wanted the lights to be turned off and then the lighting of the room to just be lighting me. So no key light, no beauty light.'</p>

<p>'The beauty light is always used on women and I said turn the f******g lights off. You would never tell Travis Scott or Adam Levine that he couldn't turn the beauty light off.'</p>

<p>The pop star continued: 'They said, "Okay, we'll just do the same thing that we would do with the guys," because that's what I want.'</p>

<p>Beauty: Miley - who shared these stunning snaps on Thursday - made the comments while appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast</p>

<p>'And then something that I was doing... for the VMAs, my bracelets kept getting caught in all this s***t and they said, '"you want to be treated like a guy? We wouldn't be dealing with this if a guy was doing it."' </p>

<p>'And I said, "Well a guy wouldn't be doing this because a guy doesn't sell your show with sex the way that I'm going to,"' she divulged. 'And I'm aware of that. It's a ridiculous conversation and also embarrassing.'</p>

<p>Miley's performance saw her stride across a giant disco ball on stage as she held onto a chain in a skimpy pair of pants. </p>
