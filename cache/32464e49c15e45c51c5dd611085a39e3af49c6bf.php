<p>Slammed: Blake Shelton was slammed by fans on Twitter after he shared a false claim relating to coronavirus deaths on Sunday (pictured in 2019)</p>

<p>'I’m not even sure which side(politically) this would land on,' he wrote. 'But am I the only person who sees the new CDC update as some actual good news?'  </p>

<p>In the true latest CDC report it noted that for 6% of victims 'Covid-19 was the only cause mentioned' while the other 94% of victims also suffered from a pre-existing condition. </p>

<p>Pre-existing conditions can include obesity, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, among others that can also make a person high-risk for the virus, but that condition does not mean COVID didn't play a major role in their death.  </p>

<p>Shelton added: '[It's] just updated info that’s better than we thought. I mean does everything have to be a fight these days?'</p>

<p>Clarified, false: After being questioned by fans on what exactly he was referring to, the country singer clarified he was in fact referring to the false 6% claim. 'Sorry I should’ve been more clear. I’m talking about 6% news,' he tweeted. 'Again I’m not looking for an argument from either side. I just see it as some better news is all' </p>

<p>Fans and followers were quick to try and correct The Voice coach.  </p>

<p>'Do some actual research, Blake,' one wrote. 'A majority of the damn country has pre-existing health conditions. A lot don’t even know they have them.' </p>

<p>Missed the point: Fans and followers were quick to try and correct The Voice coach. 'Do some actual research, Blake,' one wrote. 'A majority of the damn country has pre-existing health conditions. A lot don’t even know they have them.' Shelton did not respond to the correction </p>

<p>Twitter fight: In a separate tweet, he continued: 'Whew... I can see that there’s no way a fight won’t erupt about this stuff. No matter how you slice it. And that’s last thing I wanted. Stay healthy and safe everyone' </p>

<p>The fan added: 'So, if they contract COVID, it’s okay because those without will probably live? If you don’t understand the info, just don’t say anything.' </p>

<p>Though, in his response, the singer seemed to ignore the correction the fan was trying to make instead choosing to take the comment as argumentative. </p>

<p>'This is what I’m talking about,' he wrote. 'I’m not going to argue at all because I’m not advocating for anything. What is the fight? Covid is horrifying. That’s it.' </p>

<p>Halted: Earlier this year, Shelton postponed dates of his Friends and Heroes Tour due to the pandemic and has since hosted a drive-in concert using pre-recorded footage (pictured in 2017)</p>

<p>A QAnon user started sharing the false claim misrepresenting the new CDC report and falsely asserting the other 94% of deaths weren't COVID related. QAnon is a far-right conspiracy group. </p>

<p>The CDC recently projected that the United States will reach 200,000 deaths by the middle of September, as the country reaches 6m cases. </p>

<p>The U.S. remains as the country with the most confirmed cases of the virus and the most deaths.  </p>
