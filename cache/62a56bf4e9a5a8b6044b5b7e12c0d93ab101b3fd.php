<p>Eye-popping: Megan Barton Hanson treated her Instagram followers to quite the eye-popping sight on Monday evening, when he shared a shot of herself posing in a pink teddy suit</p>

<p>Showing off her peachy posterior in the mirror selfie, the star wore her golden locks in a relaxed ponytail, while she highlighted her looks with a rich palette of makeup. </p>

<p>The Essex native added further glamour to her eye-catching look with a selection of glittering gold jewellery, which included a pendant necklace and earrings.</p>

<p>Captioning the image, Megan revealed that she was on the verge of dishing out sex advice to fans in collaboration with a sex toy manufacturer.</p>

<p>Wow: Megan's post comes one week after she stripped off to lingerie for her another social media snap to promote her OnlyFans page</p>

<p>She wrote: 'If you haven’t already, check out my first IGTV with LELO answering your most asked sex-related questions and find out what’s so special about these two toys <?php echo e('@'); ?>lelo_official#WellWithLELO #PleasureInMyHands #ComeTogether.'</p>

<p>Megan's post comes one week after she stripped off to lingerie for her another social media snap to promote her OnlyFans page.</p>

<p>The star displayed her ample cleavage and taut midriff in a semi-sheer yellow bra paired with thong underwear as she snapped the selfie.</p>

<p>Megan oozed confidence as she put on an eye-popping display in the yellow and pale blue lace bra, which also drew the eye to her slender waist. </p>

<p>Wow! Megan recently went completely nude for a racy photoshoot for her account on X-rated subscription service OnlyFans </p>

<p>Her caramel flecked brunette tresses were styled in soft waves while her pretty features were enhanced with smoky shadow, fluttery lashes and nude gloss. </p>

<p>She captioned the snap: 'For content like this and more check out my only fans page.'  </p>

<p>Essex girl Megan was initially revealed to have had an OnlyFans account as she embarked on her meteoric rise to reality TV fame in June of 2018.  </p>

<p>The site charges for access to people's often saucy pages, and is a big hit with social media favourites, porn actors and reality TV stars looking to branch out.</p>

<p>Less is more: The Love Island star left nothing to the imagination as she posed up a storm in a bathtub, before switching into pink lingerie to plug her account recently</p>

<p>At the time, Megan was said to have kept her subscribers entertained with content that included nude snapshots of videos of her in the shower.</p>

<p>The brunette stepped away from OnlyFans after making it to the Love Island final with her then-boyfriend Wes Nelson, as they made the most of their newfound fame.</p>

<p>She has since reactivated her account and is charging $24.99 (£18.76) a month for access to her racy snaps.     </p>

<p>Megan previously revealed that she had received death threats over her decision to get cosmetic surgery after it was revealed she'd been under the knife. </p>

<p>Speaking to Kathy Burke during a segment on her documentary All Woman last year, Megan spoke about the backlash she received after appearing on Love Island. </p>

<p>The TV personality revealed: 'I got so much stick for it in the island.</p>

<p>'I thought yeah they would mention the fact that I slept with two boys, yeah they would mention I was a stripper and I'd done glamour modelling. </p>

<p>But I didn't think there would be that much stick for getting surgery. There would be comments that I was fake and plastic. I was getting death threats at one point. I think people just love to hate.'</p>

<p>Megan added: 'Whether you edit yourself on these apps or in real life you get so much stick. These platforms are out here and these adverts are targeted at girls my age. They encourage it and when you do it you get vilified.'</p>
