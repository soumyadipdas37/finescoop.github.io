<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Their unlikely friendship was revealed back in June.</p>

<p>And on Tuesday, Married At First Sight star Aleks Markovic left her Reality Roundup co-hosts shocked with her claims about what Locky Gilbert got up to during his break from filming The Bachelor. </p>

<p>'I can tell you now that Locky wasn't just texting The Bachelor Girls. It was them and every other girl in WA,' she said. </p>

<p>Hello! On Tuesday, Married At First Sight star Aleks Markovic (pictured) said Locky Gilbert was texting 'every other girl in WA' while filming The Bachelor in lockdown </p>

<p>When asked by host Filip Odžak if Bella Varelis' recent behaviour on the Channel 10 dating show is her own undoing she replied: 'I can't comment much on this because, I was with Locky [during the COVID break].'</p>

<p>The 27-year-old continued: 'I think those three girls need to have each other's backs, because at the end of the day they've only got each other at the end.'</p>

<p>Aleks then explained that fans should be reminded that the reality show was filmed months ago, and Locky and the girls could have potentially parted ways.</p>

<p>When asked by host Filip if Bella Varelis' recent behaviour on the Channel 10 dating show is her own undoing she replied: 'I can't comment much on this because, I was with Locky [during the COVID break].'</p>

<p>Back in March, wild rumours surfaced about what happened behind the scenes after on-site production of The Bachelor was suspended in Sydney to prevent the spread of COVID-19. </p>

<p>According to Woman's Day, Locky resumed his usual social life when he returned to Perth - and one night out in April apparently left some of the contestants unhappy.</p>

<p>After being spotted together on social media, Aleks addressed the rumours about her and Locky on The Kyle and Jackie O Show on April 30.  </p>

<p>Response: After being spotted together on social media, Aleks told The Kyle and Jackie O Show on April 30 that Locky was a 'beautiful person', but clarified they were just friends </p>

<p>Aleks said that Locky was a 'beautiful person', but clarified they were just friends.</p>

<p>The Sydney-based real estate agent said she'd only met Locky the weekend prior when they were both visiting a mutual friend's house.</p>

<p>'I didn't even really know who he was,' she said of Locky. 'When he walked in the door, my friend was like, "He's The Bachelor!"'</p>

<p>'He's a lovely boy but for me, I think he's definitely got his eye on someone on The Bachelor,' she added.</p>

<p>Displeased: The contestants, who were all self-isolating in their own homes, were apparently not happy when they found out Locky was spending time with Aleks (pictured)</p>
