<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Ronald Koeman is reportedly unable to take charge of Barcelona in an official game leaving the club's plans for the new season in jeopardy.  </p>

<p>Cadena COPE in Spain reported on Wednesday night that while the Dutchman was unveiled by president Josep Maria Bartomeu earlier this summer as a replacement to Quique Setien, the necessary paperwork remains outstanding. </p>

<p>Setien, according to the report, has not been officially sacked and a severance package between the former manager and the club has still to be agreed, leaving Koeman in limbo on the eve of their LaLiga opener against Villarreal later this month. </p>

<p>More to follow. </p>
