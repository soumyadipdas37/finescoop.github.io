<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A dad-of-three has taken advantage of his live appearance on national television to propose to his long-term partner in front of their kids.</p>

<p>Rhys Scott appeared on the Today show on Thursday morning and took the traditional approach of getting down on one knee and asking: 'Will you marry me Natasha Leigh?'</p>

<p>The mother to Brooklyn, Harlon and Weston beamed with excitement as she embraced Mr Scott and kissed him.</p>

<p>The couple then hugged as Ms Leigh said 'yes', and the children held a sign in the background saying 'Mummy marry daddy'.</p>

<p>The sweet moment was caught at Sirromet Wines at Mount Cotton, Queensland, while the family was among the on-site guests for the breakfast program's weather forecast.</p>

<p>Weatherman Tim Davies caught up with the couple moments later to clarify how long they had known each other and how soon they would be getting married.</p>

<p>The couple then hugged as Ms Leigh said 'yes', and the children held a sign in the background saying 'Mummy marry daddy' (pictured)</p>

<p>The could have married on the spot - they had a perfect location and she was dressed in white - but Ms Leigh said the wedding would 'need some time' to organise and forecast they would tie the knot in 'maybe a year'.</p>

<p>'Need this one to not be the menace,' she joked about one of her young children who was wriggling all over the place while being interviewed.</p>

<p>The couple met at a Gold Coast night club seven years ago.</p>

<p>Mr Scott told Mr Davies he knew Mr Leigh was the one as soon as he set his sights on her and 'had a lot of work to do'.</p>

<p>In a surprise twist, Ms Leigh (pictured) said she would 'need some time' before confirming the couple would tie the knot in 'maybe a year' - despite being dressed for the occasion on Thursday by wearing white</p>

<p>'He harassed me,' Ms Leigh joked.</p>

<p>In keeping with his traditional approach, Mr Scott had sought the approval of Ms Leigh's dad the night before.</p>

<p>'I almost missed that phone call but got it in time,' he said. 'I had so much on my mind.' </p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia has reached out to the couple for comment. </p>
