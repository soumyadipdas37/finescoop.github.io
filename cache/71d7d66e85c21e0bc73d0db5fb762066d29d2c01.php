<p>New Zealand woman Letticia Pevy, 38, was mortified to receive an automatic fail from the examiner because the front passenger seat of her Mazda was too dirty and deemed a COVID-19 risk.</p>

<p>Ms Pevy insists she had cleaned the seat before the test but would have taken more care if she was aware of the consequences of not meeting the examiner's strict standards.</p>

<p>She was left crying in her car for 45 minutes afterwards. </p>

<p>'It's not immaculate but as a busy working mum of five, our family car is often last priorities,' Ms Pevy told 7news.com.au.</p>

<p>'Had I been informed prior on what their expectation was, obviously I would have gone to greater lengths to get it up to scratch.'</p>

<p>Ms Pevy, from Hamilton, took the result to heart.</p>

<p>'To be told your car is a health and safety hazard, I don't think I've ever been in my adult life so mortified and embarrassed,' she told Stuff.</p>

<p>'I was a nervous wreck a couple of nights beforehand. I had a couple of those dreams, so what if, thoughts. I actually think I had gone through every single possible scenario; having a messy vehicle didn't even occur to me.'</p>

<p>Ms Pevy also claimed the testing officer was not wearing personal protective equipment at the time.</p>

<p>Drving test organisation VTNZ intially refused to refund the $109.50 booking fee. </p>

<p>However it has since apologised and allowed Ms Pevy to resit the test for her full driving licence free after the story attracted media attention.</p>

<p>'As we continue to move through different COVID-19 alert levels we are following strict health and safety procedures while conducting driver tests,' operations support manager James Law told Stuff.</p>

<p>Letticia Pevy (pictured) has received an apology and will be allowed to resit the test for free</p>
