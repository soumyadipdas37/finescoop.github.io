<p>The evening out comes after Kylie praised her 'supportive' boyfriend Paul for staying by her side when she was sick. </p>

<p>The Australian pop star was forced to cancel gigs on her Golden Tour in October 2018 after coming down with an infection, but revealed Paul helped nurse her back to health. </p>

<p>Joking that the creative was 'thrown into the deep end' by dating her, Kylie told The Sun: 'He had to come to the rescue a few times on tour when I was really unwell. He'd swoop in and hold me in a way that no one else can.'</p>

<p>Kylie continued: 'He cares about my fans, he cares about my world, but mostly he cares about me. It's so nice to have that one person who's not involved in your tour, not in that way, and just wants to know that I'm OK.'</p>

<p>Gushing that things were going 'really good' between the pair, she concluded:  We're really low-key, we're very real, very supportive. We're just taking things as they come for now, for always. Who knows what's to come?'   </p>

<p>The couple have been going from strength to strength since they first laid eyes on each other when they were introduced through mutual friends in February 2018.</p>

<p>Kylie met Paul - who works as GQ magazine’s creative director - following the breakdown of her relationship with Joshua Sasse. </p>

<p>The singer and her actor ex-fiancé Joshua, now 32, announced their split in February 2017 after three years together. </p>

<p>At the time, unconfirmed reports claimed the singer booted the British actor out of her West London home after he grew too close to Spanish actress Marta Milans, 35.</p>

<p>After their split the songstress, who said she felt 'broken at the time, took herself to Thailand to 'heal' herself.</p>

<p>Supportive: The pop sensation revealed that Paul helped look after her when she was sick from an infection during her 2018 Golden Tour and had to cancel some gigs</p>
