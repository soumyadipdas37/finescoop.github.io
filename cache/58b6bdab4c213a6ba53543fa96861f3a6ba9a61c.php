<p>Being an animal lover, Barton has been open about how her dogs, and the responsibilities that come with them, have helped keep her grounded over the years, especially during the height of her career.   </p>

<p>The London, England native has even found a beneficial silver lining to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic when it comes to staying grounded.</p>

<p>"It's given me a lot of privacy and calm, a lot of time to concentrate on myself and stay at home and be with family and friends,' she confessed to Entertainment Tonight in August about her time in quarantine.</p>

<p>'Sometimes I'm so busy running around and working that I don't get to do that, so it's been nice to see the planet take a little bit of a reset and... see people care more about each other.'</p>

<p>Most recently, Barton has been romantically linked to actor Gian Marco Flamini. The pair were seen walking arm-in-arm and sharing kisses during a stroll in LA's Echo Park last week.</p>

<p>She had been dating Australian model James Abercrombie on and off over the last few years.   </p>

<p>In August, Barton opened up about why she thinks a reboot of The O.C. could work, despite her character being killed off at the end of season three.  </p>

<p>"I think there are ways it could happen for sure. I mean in this industry there's a way to do everything. If you really wanna get The O.C. back, of course we could, of course there's a way," the actress told ET of the drama that also starred Ben McKenzie, Rachel Bilson and Adam Brody.</p>

<p>'Characters can slightly change or diverge or come back as a cousin. Like, who cares?'  </p>
