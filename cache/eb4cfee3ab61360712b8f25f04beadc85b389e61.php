<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A wealthy businessman was stunned to find a suite he regularly stays at in one of Sydney's most exclusive hotels was used to film a movie on Pornhub. </p>

<p>The x-rated video, filmed at The Star casino's Darling hotel, was uploaded to the site three months ago and has been so popular, it's become a 'feature' on the world's most prominent porn site and has been viewed 300,000 times.</p>

<p>The businessman who regularly stays at the corner suite, which costs $1,4000 a night, was shocked to discover the raunchy video online.</p>

<p>A room at The Star casino's Darling Hotel has been used to film a top-rated threesome on Pornhub</p>

<p>A spokesperson for The Star said the casino giant had no knowledge of the erotic shoot</p>

<p>But The Star confirmed the video was shot in The Darling hotel suite about two years ago</p>

<p>'I've stayed in that hotel many times; although I can hand on heart say my bedroom's never looked like that,' he told Daily Mail Australia.</p>

<p>'The hotel has a particular style. From the decorating to the layout of the bed, desk and bathroom, I picked the location immediately.'</p>

<p>A spokesperson for The Star said they had no knowledge of the erotic shoot involving two muscular men and a brunette Australian woman- until they were contacted by Daily Mail Australia. </p>

<p>'While previously unaware of this video, we have determined it was filmed at least two years ago,' the statement said. </p>

<p>'The Star does not condone or permit filming on property for commercial purposes,' the statement said.</p>

<p>Daily Mail Australia tracked down Charlotte Star - the woman at the centre of the popular video produced by the home-grown company Aussie A** - to find out more about the secretive but very lucrative business.</p>

<p>'I don't want the porn industry in Australia to get a worse name than it already has... but yes it was there,' the actress confirmed.</p>

<p>'The best thing about the industry is that you can film it anywhere. With COVID most people are just filming it in their homes.</p>

<p>'For me, I mostly film private in homes. But I have also filmed, and done photo shoots at hotels.'</p>

<p>Although rules exist around filming adult content in Australian hotels, the privacy of guests is normally the top priority for accommodation providers, meaning questions are seldom raised with camera crews or performers. </p>

<p>'Nobody ever asks,' Ms Star joked.</p>

<p>In Australia there are no restrictions when it comes to filming pornography.</p>

<p>But when it comes to monetising the content, Australians in the adult film industry are forced to look overseas. </p>

<p>'(Australia's industry) is mostly based around Pornhub and Onlyfans, which are all American companies,' Ms Star said.</p>

<p>'Uploading it to those sites is all we can do. In Australia filming porn is okay but actually selling is still illegal so we have to use foreign websites.' </p>
