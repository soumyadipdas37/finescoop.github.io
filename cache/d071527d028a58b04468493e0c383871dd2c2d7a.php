<p>Talking to Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett on Monday's Smartless podcast, the actress was asked the closest she has come to quitting Hollywood.</p>

<p>To which she said: 'I would have to say the last two years that has crossed my mind, which it never did before.'</p>

<p>Jennifer added that one project in particular, which took place before her award-winning Apple TV+ show The Morning Show with Reese Witherspoon in 2019, made her consider quitting Hollywood. </p>

<p>She revealed: 'It was after a job I had completed and I was like, "Whoa, that was really… that sucked the life out of me. And I don't know if this is what interests me."'  </p>

<p>Jennifer further explained: 'It was an unprepared project, we've all been a part of them, you always say: "I'll never again! Never again! I will never back up into a start date!"'</p>

<p>The actress added that the script 'wasn't ready' and she was stuck on the project for three months. </p>

<p>It comes after Jennifer admitted in June that playing Rachel Green on Friends left her feeling typecast in Hollywood.    </p>

<p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the actress shared that she has fought 'forever' for the industry to see her as something different than 'that girl in the New York apartment with the purple walls.' </p>

<p>Jennifer said: 'I could not get Rachel Green off of my back for the life of me. I could not escape "Rachel from Friends," and it's on all the time and you're like, "Stop playing that f***ing show!"' </p>

<p>The actress said that her turn in the 2002 independent movie The Good Girl was the first time she got to 'really shed' her Rachel character and that the edgy role was 'such a relief'.</p>

<p>Jennifer added: 'But I remember the panic that set over me, thinking, "Oh God, I don't know if I can do this." Maybe they're right. </p>

<p>'Maybe everybody else is seeing something I'm not seeing, which is you are only that girl in the New York apartment with the purple walls.'</p>
