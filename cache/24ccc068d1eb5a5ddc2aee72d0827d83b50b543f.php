<p>A mutual friend became aware of their relationship after finding messages the pair had sent each other.</p>

<p>Stuff reported the teenager said she felt 'gross' and 'stupid' after their relationship.</p>

<p>McMillan did not deny his sexual relationship with the young girl, but said it did not begin while she was underage.</p>

<p>The jury found McMillan guilty of meeting a young person following sexual grooming and three charges of sexual connection with a person under 16.</p>

<p>He was let off on another charge of supplying cannabis to a young person. </p>

<p>McMillan will be sentenced in October.</p>

<p>The former teacher stopped working at Kingslea in 2016 after the New Zealand Teachers Disciplinary Tribunal censured him for smoking cannabis.</p>
