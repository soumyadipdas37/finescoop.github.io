<p>EXPOSED ACTORS</p>

<p>Beauty and the Geek Australia came under fire in 2011, when 'Geek' Bendeguz Daniel Devenyi-Botos admitted he joined the series to further his acting passions.</p>

<p>Despite appearing a historian on the dating contest, Bendeguz later confessed to dropping out of university to focus on acting. </p>

<p>He told The Sunday Telegraph at the time: '[The show's producers] found me while I was in a play... I have no idea why [they] chose not to mention that I'm an actor.' </p>

<p>Since his appearance on the 2010 season, he has voiced a number of animated characters for children shows such as Oddbods and Argo's World.</p>

<p>SECRET CHILD</p>

<p>As the program is designed to pair beautiful women with socially inept men, fans were shocked to discover a contestant on the first season was already a father.   </p>

<p>After the scandal was first speculated in online chat rooms in 2009, the television network later confirmed Corin Storkey shared a daughter with a former girlfriend. </p>

<p>The then-PhD student lived with his organic chemist girlfriend while he attended college in New Zealand. They dated for four years and had a daughter named Beth.</p>

<p>Corin told the Herald Sun at the time: 'She was the main relationship of my life after we got together when I was 18... we split up just around the time she got pregnant and she has since married.' </p>

<p>JAILED STAR </p>

<p>In April, a former Channel Seven reality TV star sobbed as a judge sentenced her to up to four years' jail for dealing heroin - after hearing how her life spiraled out of control following her brush with fame.</p>

<p>Beauty and the Geek runner-up Jordan Finlayson, 29, cried out as New South Wales District Court Judge Phillip Mahony hit her with the hefty jail sentence.</p>

<p>Ms Finlayson was a successful model and dancer, an NRL cheerleader and briefly, the face of the Australian canteen food, the Chiko roll. She dated 'Geek' Lachlan Cosgrove for close to a year after the program, but the relationship fizzled out.</p>

<p>Jail was the culmination of a stretch of drug-related crime for Finlayson, who appeared in front of a Sydney's Downing Centre Court via audio-visual link from jail. She sat hunched in a crumpled green prison jumpsuit, hair in a messy bun, as details were revealed of her drugged-out downfall.</p>

<p>While their relationship did last for a few years, they later ended their engagement. </p>
