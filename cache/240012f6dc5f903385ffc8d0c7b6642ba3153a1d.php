<p>The Syndicate is an anthology series which tells the tale of a different group of friends each series, who through a betting syndicate end up winning the lottery.</p>

<p>The first series in 2012 took place at a Leeds supermarket, while later series centred around a hospital in Bradford and a stately home in Scarborough, with each series also featuring an ensemble of new actors.</p>

<p>Filming for the show was delayed due to the COVID-19 crisis, but finally began earlier this week.</p>

<p>Exciting: Katie is set to join a star-studded cast for the new series of the show, which documents different groups of friends who win the lottery through a betting syndicate</p>

<p>Of the fourth series, writer Kay Mellor told The Sun: 'This series is a brand-new story about a syndicate of low paid kennel workers who think they’ve won the lottery but have been robbed of their ticket.</p>

<p>'The chase to confront the culprit takes us to the wealthy French Riviera where the young syndicate find themselves well out of their depth.'</p>

<p>The series is also thought to be starring Emmerdale's Gaynor Faye, who happens to be writer Kay's daughter.</p>

<p>Kym Marsh is also thought to be appearing, alongside Strictly Come Dancing's Joe Sugg.</p>
