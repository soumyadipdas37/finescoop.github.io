<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The annual City2Surf run has been cancelled for the first time in 50 years because of coronavirus restrictions.</p>

<p>The organisers announced on Friday the iconic Sydney run 'will not be possible in 2020'.  </p>

<p>'Unfortunately, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current NSW Government restrictions on mass gatherings, a physical City2Surf cannot take place as planned on 18 October 2020,' organisers said.  </p>

<p>Instead, a City2Surf Virtual Run will be held in its place.</p>

<p>Runners are encouraged to run along their own neighbourhood streets. </p>
