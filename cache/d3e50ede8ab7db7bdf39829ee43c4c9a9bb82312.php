<p>The six biggest car hire firms charge an average of £147 for a week’s insurance in the Spanish resort area. By comparison, the six top-rated independent policies sold online cost just £23 on average.</p>

<p>The lowest price from a car hire company was £115 with Enterprise, according to Which? Avis, Alamo, Europcar, Goldcar and Hertz policies were all more expensive.</p>

<p>Rory Boland of Which? said: ‘Car hire is an industry plagued with unscrupulous practices, with wildly excessive charges for sub-standard insurance policies just one of the pitfalls customers should be wary of when choosing a rental company. The good news is that, no matter how a car hire salesperson may try to persuade you at the desk, you don’t have to fork out for one of these eye-wateringly expensive policies. Much more thorough cover is available online for a fraction of the cost.’</p>

<p>The expensive policies also provided inferior cover according to insurance experts consulted by Which?</p>

<p>The six independent providers received scores ranging between 75 per cent and 82 per cent. But the highest score for a car rental firm was 61 per cent. They also made significant exclusions, such as not covering for chipped window screens.</p>

<p>A spokesman for car rental trade body BVRLA said last night: ‘You can drive a rental away at the low daily price, but you should always know what your risk factor is and this is the excess.</p>

<p>‘The lower the daily rental, the higher the excess tends to be. It is up to the customer whether they then take out a waiver or a third-party insurance product to reduce or eliminate that excess.’</p>
