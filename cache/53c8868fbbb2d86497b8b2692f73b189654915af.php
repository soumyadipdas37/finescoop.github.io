<p>'Knickers have been the bane of my life, so I haven’t looked back': Ulrika Jonsson has explained why she swapped 'uncomfortable' thongs for 'apple catcher’ underwear in a new interview</p>

<p>The media personality shared how she's struggled with thongs since her younger years as she spent a lot of her time correcting spillage, which caused her to feel 'unique' and 'weird'.</p>

<p>'They’ve been nothing but the proverbial pain in the a**e. Having to veil my vagina and shroud my undercarriage is almost some kind of mild, modern oppression', the host told The Sun. 'Oh, I’ll never forget trying on my first G-string. Not quite as traumatic as childbirth but definitely up there.'</p>

<p>The broadcaster went on to recall moments when she left 'changing rooms in floods of tears' after failing to find swimwear which accentuated her curves. </p>

<p>'It was disastrous': The broadcaster went on to recall moments when she left 'changing rooms in floods of tears' after failing to find swimwear which accentuated her curves </p>

<p>She shared: 'I invariably ended up with an awkward-fitting bikini bottom which never fully embraced my nether assets but also a disastrous, unsupportive bikini top which allowed my boobs to spread, escape and go on their own separate holiday.' </p>

<p>The blonde insisted she saw 'apple catchers' as her 'only solution', and has managed to feel comfortable ever since leaving sexy underwear behind. </p>

<p>Ulrika first revealed her switch earlier this week, when she displayed her enviable frame in black boy shorts for a bedroom snap uploaded on Instagram. </p>

<p>'G-strings are not quite as bad as childbirth, but they're up there!' The media personality revealed she would revert to sporting full briefs during her pregnancies (pictured in 2004)</p>

<p>Her blonde tresses were styled in loose waves as she also showcased her bronzed legs. </p>

<p> She captioned the snap: 'Time to put my big girls’ pants on. Always preferred big Apple Catchers to Dental Floss anyway. I’m a comfort girl. Looks grim outside but got to crack on.</p>

<p>'Right now, I’d love someone to bring me a cuppa in bed but that ain’t happening. Gonna get my a**e in gear and soldier on.'</p>
