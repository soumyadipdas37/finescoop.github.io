<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A black freshman at a college in Texas was woken by police storming her dorm room with guns drawn after a group of students made a false report that she had scissors and threatened to stab people.</p>

<p>Christin Evans was sleeping at 3am on September 14 when cops barged into her living quarters at Stephen F. Austin State University due to the incident Evans' parents described as 'swatting' - where a false report leads to an aggressive response from law enforcement.</p>

<p>A 'racially diverse' group of 10 females were said to be involved in the dangerous prank, including Evans' three roommates who are white. Evans' mother said the majority of the students involved are white.</p>

<p>The students reported Evans to a resident adviser on the Nacogdoches, Texas campus, who then called law enforcement.</p>

<p>Christin Evans, 17, has been left shaken after police confronted her with guns drawn after a false police report on September 14</p>

<p>The teen is a freshman at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas and students falsely claimed she had scissors and threatened to stab people</p>

<p>Evans was sleeping at 3am when cops barged into her living quarters where she had three white roommates who were involved</p>

<p>Two weeks later the family had no idea what campus police planned to do about the false report. Pictured is a thread of text messages with police</p>

<p>Campus police learned the report was false after checking surveillance footage.</p>

<p>Evans' lawyer said the Houston girl's fate could've been the same as Breonna Taylor.</p>

<p>'Their daughter was sleeping and awoken at 3 o'clock in the morning by local police with flashlights shining out and their guns drawn. This could have been a Breonna Taylor circumstance,' Randall Kallinen said in a video from KPRC 2.</p>

<p>Taylor was shot dead when Louisville Police officers stormed her apartment in March, despite the fact the man they were looking for – an ex-boyfriend - was already in custody.</p>

<p>'Kids sleep with their phones in their bed. What if they [saw] her phone flash, or the back of her phone is shiny … and they had reported she had a knife. They could've shot her,' Evans' mother LeShondra said.</p>

<p>The news conference took place after two weeks down the line cops are still looking into the matter. The teen has been moved out of the four-person dorm room but it was unclear what the college planned to do about the students facing repercussions for the false report.</p>

<p>The teen who was recruited for cheer, says the incident has affected her college experience and general wellbeing. 'Now I feel shaken. I can't sleep at night. It has made me paranoid,' she said</p>

<p>She became tearful in a press conference on Monday as the family demanded the school take action</p>

<p>This could have been a Breonna Taylor circumstance,' lawyer Randall Kallinen said Monday</p>

<p>'I want justice,' her mother said. 'I want them to have consequences. They played with her life.'</p>

<p>Her father also expressed his concern for the child's safety.</p>

<p>'Yes, we're upset and we want something to be done about it,' Chris Evans said. 'When I sent my daughter off to school, my worse-case scenario was that she should call needing money or an issue with her grades.'</p>

<p>SFA has been criticized online for taking weeks to state their intentions of an investigation when in other circumstances universities have taken action the same day over matter with less dangerous consequences.</p>

<p>'The students will be held accountable for this at every possible level,' SFA Chief of Police John Fields said in a video message.</p>

<p>SFA President Scott Gordon said in a statement on Monday that 'judicial processes take time.'</p>

<p>'Each perpetrator will be dealt with appropriately,' Gordon added. 'My heart goes out to the young lady who was an innocent victim in this matter. We will do all we can to support her and her family through this heinous ordeal.'</p>
