<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Amazon delivery driver was caught on camera brazenly letting himself into a customer's home in order to deliver a package.</p>

<p>Rufaro Chitima, 30, from Dudley, West Midlands, had been at home when the driver opened her front door and left her Amazon parcel inside her property.</p>

<p>The makeup artist and lash technician, who was left 'lost for words', said she later received an email from Amazon which claimed the parcel 'had been handed to the resident'. </p>

<p>The Amazon delivery driver approaches the front door of the house in Dudley, West Midlands, and pushes down on the door handle</p>

<p>Rufaro Chitima, 30, was left speechless when she realised the worker has let himself into her home</p>

<p>The makeup artist shared the video on Facebook and described how she was 'lost for words'</p>

<p>During the CCTV footage, which was filmed on September 3, the delivery driver walks towards Ms Chitima's front door and pushes down the door handle without knocking.</p>

<p>As the door swings open, the Amazon worker bends down and deposits the package inside the hall, leaning over the doorstep to place it on the floor.</p>

<p>He then shuts the door behind him and walks away from the property without a second glance.</p>

<p>A few seconds later, the door opens again as Ms Chitima investigates how the parcel ended up inside her house.</p>

<p>Shortly after the delivery, the shocked makeup artist received an email from Amazon asking her to rate the driver's performance.</p>

<p>The email dated on September 3 read: 'Parcel was handed to resident'.</p>

<p>Ms Chitima received a message from Amazon shortly after the delivery which stated the parcel was 'handed to resident'</p>

<p>Ms Chitima later took to social media to complain to Amazon about her delivery in a message which read: 'Lost for words. When did it become acceptable for an Amazon driver to let themselves into your home?'</p>

<p>A member of Amazon's social media team has since replied to the customer's video and asked for further details about the delivery.</p>

<p>In response to Ms Chitima's post on Facebook, Amazon wrote: 'We'd like to have a member of our Transportation team look into this for you. At your earliest convenience, please submit your tracking and order number here.' </p>

<p>An Amazon spokesperson told MailOnline: 'We have reached out to the customer to offer our support. We have investigated the matter and are taking appropriate action.' </p>
