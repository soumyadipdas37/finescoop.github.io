<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>At 15 months of age, most toddlers can just say a few words and have recently learned to walk and climb.</p>

<p>But one fearless tot has taken climbing to new heights!</p>

<p>Fifteen-month-old toddler, Ezzy, wouldn't stop clambering all over their furniture so his parents built him his very own climbing wall instead. </p>

<p>Fifteen-month-old toddler, Ezzy, wouldn't stop climbing the furniture so his parents built him his very own indoor climbing wall instead</p>

<p>The indoor climbing wall is complete with multi-coloured grips, handles and safety crash mats below for a soft landing.</p>

<p>However, the new climbing wall only spurred the 'powerful' tot on from strength to strength.</p>

<p>An incredible video shows Ezzy, with a baby's dummy in his mouth, scaling the wall with ease.</p>

<p>He moves confidently up the wall, reaching the climbing holds until he nears the top and then drops to the safety mat below. </p>

<p>The clip was uploaded to Twitter on September 21 with the caption: 'My friend built his kid a climbing wall to get him to stop climbing furniture and it only made the tot more powerful.'</p>

<p>It has already been viewed over 500,000 times with people commenting on the tot's skill and natural climbing ability.</p>

<p>One person wrote: 'Holy sh**! He’s already using weight shifting and leg position technique naturally, that I LEARNED as a beginning climber!'</p>

<p>Climbing as a competitive sport will make its debut at the next Olympics in Tokyo, due to be held in 2021.</p>

<p>Perhaps we are watching a future Olympian in the making?</p>
