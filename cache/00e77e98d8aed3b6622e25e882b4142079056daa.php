<p>The video shot by Richie Chaalan enraged the owners of the zoo in Eastern Creek, western Sydney, they vowed to press charges.</p>

<p>Unrepentant prankster Mohammed Ali Khawaja, 30, who dived into a zoo aquarium, is also accused of breaking into an emu enclosure and fighting with them</p>

<p>He is also accused of 'causing two emus distress by chasing and pretending to fight them'.</p>

<p>'Mak', as his friends call him, is charged with behaving in an offensive manner in public, entering an animal enclosure, and entering enclosed land to interfere with a business.</p>

<p>Mr Chaalan made no apologies for the aquarium intrusion, claiming to Daily Mail Australia in July that Sydney Zoo was in the wrong.</p>

<p>He could be heard laughing on the video as his mate Mak swam into view on the viral video.</p>

<p>'What the f*** is that,' Mr Chaalan says as he laughs hysterically while the aquarium intruder ducks and dives in and between the fish.</p>

<p>Another friend can also be seen filming Mak's antics.</p>

<p>Mr Chaalan told Daily Mail Australia the stunt wasn't planned. </p>

<p>'My friend is a big fish lover and thought it would be good idea to jump in while we were visiting the zoo,' he said.</p>

<p>'We have no regrets and are hoping to do it again.'</p>

<p>Khawaja, 30, was filmed by laughing friends swimming with fish in his boxer shorts at Sydney Zoo on July 27</p>

<p>Khawaja pleaded not guilty to three charges in Blacktown Local Court on Thursday, which revealed his alleged mischief wasn't just aquatic</p>

<p>He was unfazed about threats of police and legal action and accused Sydney Zoo of animal cruelty.</p>

<p>'They're the ones in the wrong by entrapping aquatic life against their will,' he said.</p>

<p>'I don't think they found out yet,' Mr Chaalan commented online after a friend asked what happened to the aquarium intruder. </p>

<p>'I can't believe he done that,' he captioned the footage.</p>

<p>The video sparked an angry response from Sydney Zoo, which slammed the men involved.</p>

<p> Mr Chaalan told Daily Mail Australia Mak is a 'big fish lover' who thought it would be good idea to get in the aquarium</p>

<p>'Your behaviour is unacceptable and completely idiotic,' the zoo posted online.</p>

<p>'You are trespassing and we have reported you to the police, who will contact you shortly.</p>

<p>'Your conduct is offensive. You've jumped a safety barrier to get into this position and you have compromised the welfare of our precious animals.</p>

<p>'Our lawyers and the police will be taking further action.'</p>

<p>In a statement to Daily Mail Australia, Sydney Zoo managing director Jake Burgess described the men's behaviour as 'appalling'.</p>

<p>'This not only jeopardises their own safety but more importantly the welfare of the animals at Sydney Zoo,' he said. </p>

<p>Khawaja will return to court on February 9. </p>

<p>Sydney Zoo have vowed to take legal action over the group's 'unacceptable' behaviour</p>
