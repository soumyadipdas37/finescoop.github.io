<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A makeup artist has transformed herself into Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews with latex, cotton wool and theatrical cosmetics.</p>

<p>With her client chair sitting empty for almost nine weeks due to Victoria's Stage Four coronavirus restrictions, Evelin Costa decided to pass time by turning herself into the man at the helm of the state's public health crisis.</p>

<p>A TikTok video of the finished look has turned the 23-year-old from Shepparton, 181 kilometres northeast of Melbourne, into an internet star, amassing hundreds of thousands of views from people who say it's made their week.</p>

<p>Ms Costa told Daily Mail Australia she was simply keeping herself entertained by filming the clip and never expected it to be seen by so vast an audience.</p>

<p>Dan, is that you? Shepparton makeup artist Evelin Costa (pictured right) transformed herself into Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews (left) with latex, cotton wool and theatrical cosmetics</p>

<p>'I wanted to turn myself into Dan Andrews because he's been receiving a lot of negativity recently and I just wanted to create some fun positive content in these difficult times,' she said.</p>

<p>Ms Costa said she started by sticking latex and cotton wool onto her face, pressing thick strips over the bridge of her nose to make it wider and under her eyebrows to create the illusion of saggy, hooded eyelids.</p>

<p>Next she used black eyeliner to sketch Mr Andrews' signature square-rimmed glasses onto her face and shade in dark spots over her teeth to mimic the shape of his mouth. </p>

<p>She said the rest was achieved through contouring with bronzer and concealer, and colouring her natural hairline to match a dark brown wig similar to the Premier's short crop.</p>

<p>Ms Costa used thick strips of latex to mimic Mr Andrews' (pictured at a press conference on September 14) nose and eyelids, and black eyeliner to sketch the outline of his signature square-rimmed glasses</p>

<p>The 23-year-old makeup artist (pictured) hopes to turn herself into Prime Minister Scott Morrison next, if only she can find the right wig</p>

<p>When she began feeling discouraged that the look would never come together, Ms Costa said she gave herself a pep talk and remembered how 'legendary' it would be if she could pull it off. </p>

<p>'It doesn't look exactly like him, but it was still fun to do,' she said.</p>

<p>The video drew delighted responses on social media with comments including 'you are so b****y talented', 'I thought this was a drawing' and 'if this isn't on the news tomorrow morning, I'm going to be mad'.</p>

<p>'I can't even with this, I don't want to scroll past it ever,' one woman wrote.</p>

<p>A second said it was the best thing she'd seen all week, while a third added: 'I have gone back and watched this everyday alongside his press conferences and it just gets funnier – you NAILED it!'</p>

<p>The transformation drew delighted responses when it was shared on TikTok, with one woman calling it the best thing she'd seen all week</p>

<p>While Ms Costa is thrilled that her artwork has attracted so much attention, she is still holding out hope that the Premier himself will stumble across the transformation.</p>

<p>'I just know Dan would approve of this,' a follower on TikTok wrote, to which she replied: 'I don't know how to get him to see it!'</p>

<p>Ms Costa hopes to transform herself into Prime Minister Scott Morrison in the coming weeks if she can get her hands on one very important accessory.</p>

<p>'I just need to find a wig!' she said.</p>
