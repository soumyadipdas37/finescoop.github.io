<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A tourist has been confronted in Bali for savagely beating up dogs and threatening people with a stick in a disgusting act of animal cruelty. </p>

<p>Sickening footage was shared online showing the man chasing after a dog at Batu Belig Beach in Bali on Wednesday. </p>

<p>He was heard shouting 'all Bali dogs have rabies' because he was previously bitten by one, and was boasting that he had 'killed two already'.</p>

<p>The man was armed with a stick and was beating up dogs and threatening people at Batu Belig Beach in Bali on Wednesday</p>

<p>A woman is then seen running and yells at the man, 'don't you dare' as a dog ran past them.</p>

<p>'What do you think you're doing?' she continued as he threatened her with the stick and yelled back.</p>

<p>He then storms off as others join the woman at telling him to go away and leave the dogs alone. </p>

<p>The woman who shared the disgusting footage said the man needs to be arrested for his heinous acts. </p>

<p>'Immediately, five people gathered around to try and protect the dogs but he was threatening them [by] poking the stick towards them and eventually he decided to leave,' she told Coconuts Bali.  </p>

<p>The man is seen approaching a stray dog on the beach shore before he is stopped by angry witnesses </p>

<p>A woman yells at the man, 'don't you dare' and he threatens her with the stick </p>

<p>Furious social media users called for the man to be found and dealt with following his atrocious behaviour.</p>

<p>'Utterly repulsive human. Take him out please,' one person wrote.</p>

<p>'What a gutless coward. Big man hitting little doggies. Come on guys, get him locked up,' another commented.</p>

<p>'What is wrong with people abusing defenceless animals??!! Made me so angry!' someone else wrote. </p>
