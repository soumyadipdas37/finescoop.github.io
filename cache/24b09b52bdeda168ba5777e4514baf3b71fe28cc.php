<p>Vineeta Whyte, 39, from Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland, who describes herself on Facebook as a 'Hindu Goddess', was accused of committing a statutory breach of the peace after she caused a racial disturbance in the street on June 23.</p>

<p>The mother-of-one, who appeared at Livingston Sheriff Court on a personal undertaking on Tuesday, is charged with allegedly displaying behaviour that was threatening and abusive and likely to cause a reasonable person fear or alarm. </p>

<p>Whyte, who was not legally represented, was advised to consult a lawyer before deciding whether to plead guilty or not guilty. </p>

<p>Vineeta Whyte, 39, from Blackburn, West Lothian, Scotland, was accused of shouting, swearing and uttering racist remarks outside her home on June 23</p>

<p>During her appearance in court, Whyte told Sheriff John MacRitchie that she had left her charge sheet at home and was unaware that she was being accused of racist behaviour.</p>

<p>The sheriff warned her that a racially aggravated crime would be looked on seriously by the court when it came to sentencing.</p>

<p>He rebuffed her attempts to discuss the evidence with him and advised her to consult a lawyer before deciding whether to plead guilty or not guilty.</p>

<p>Sheriff MacRitchie continued the case without plea until October 13 when Whyte has other cases due to call.</p>

<p>In 2019, Whyte launched a tirade of verbal abuse on two officers after she was questioned for shouting and swearing at football fans while she sat inside Waverley Station in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Following the tirade, Whyte, who previously claimed she was engaged to death row criminal Kenny Richey, pleaded guilty to shouting, swearing, uttering threats and uttering sexual remarks to police officers.</p>

<p>Whyte was told by the sheriff that a racially aggravated crime would be looked on seriously and was advised to consult a lawyer</p>

<p>Earlier that year she also boasted that she had exchanged intimate messages and photos online with married Dancing on Ice star Mark Little.</p>

<p>She claimed that she started sending the 59-year-old Australian soap star, who played Joe Mangel in Neighbours, sexual messages after reportedly adding him as a friend on Facebook.</p>

<p>In August 2017, Whyte also appeared in court over a racist Brexit rant she had directed at police officers after they were sent to investigate her over claims she had taken topless selfies of herself in a restaurant at Glasgow Airport. </p>

<p>The former adult film star called the officers 'white pig c***' before going on to say she 'couldn't wait for f****** Brexit', The Daily Record reported.</p>

<p>She later admitted making racist remarks and acting in a racially aggravated way towards police officers at Paisley Sheriff Court.</p>
