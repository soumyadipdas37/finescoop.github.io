<p>The Democratic Party set up a drive-in in a parking lot outside the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware on the final night of the Democratic National Convention so there would be an audience to cheer Biden and Harris as they emerged together as the official presidential ticket to watch fireworks.</p>

<p>He's packed thousands into airport hangars as well. </p>

<p>The president told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he wasn't personally worried about contracting the coronavirus.  </p>

<p>'I'm on a stage and it's very far away,' he told the paper. 'And so I'm not at all concerned.'   </p>
