<p>Too much information: Bachelor viewers were given an eyeful during Thursday's episode of the show when Locky Gilbert stood up naked in the bath. Pictured with Izzy Sharman-Firth (left)</p>

<p>'I am UNCOMFY with the angles I witnessed!' tweeted one unsuspecting viewer, while another wrote, 'Truly a miracle we didn't all cop and [sic] eyeful of testicle'.</p>

<p>One person said they felt like they were 'intruding on a very awkward Zoom call' after the coronavirus pandemic forced production of the show into lockdown.</p>

<p>'To the poor <?php echo e('@'); ?>Channel10AU editors that had to meticulously edit Locky's junk out of this scene, I'm so sorry,' tweeted one viewer.</p>

<p>Cheers to that: The 31-year-old Bachelor was enjoying a virtual date with Izzy, when he cheekily stood up to reach for his glass of wine</p>

<p>Naked truth: It's safe to say most fans weren't expecting the raunchy moment, especially given the show's 7.30pm time slot</p>

<p>Added another: 'The bubbles were disintegrating way too quickly for my liking... much like my mental health during 2020...'</p>

<p>After Locky stood suddenly in the bathtub, a shocked Izzy, 29, started laughing hysterically, which irked some viewers.   </p>

<p>'This is very boring TV. And I feel Izzy's laugh is totally fake, it has to be... sorry Locky's just not that funny,' tweeted one viewer. </p>

<p>'This is very boring TV. And I feel Izzy's laugh is totally fake, it has to be... sorry Locky's just not that funny,' tweeted one viewer</p>

<p>Added another: 'Is it just me; or does Izzy have a laugh like a hyena?'</p>

<p>Things turned flirty when Izzy jokingly complained that there were 'too many bubbles' in Locky's bath.  </p>

<p>'Are you just getting me to stand up?' he asked, prompting her to respond, 'Yeah, I'd just like to see a little bit more of your skin.' </p>

<p>The Bachelor continues Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten </p>
