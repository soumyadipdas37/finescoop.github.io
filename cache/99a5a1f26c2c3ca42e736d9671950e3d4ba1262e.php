<p>However, Apple reveals in the update that certain functions may not be rolled out because ‘system availability depends on support from your local public health authority.’</p>

<p>Apple’s next iPhone update could let users receive coronavirus exposure notifications without having to download a third-party app. Users will be able to turn the notifications on in 'Settings' on an iPhone or iPad</p>

<p>Coronavirus cases have begun to decrease across the world, however contact tracing apps are still a key players in keeping infection rates at bay.</p>

<p>Prior to the new discovery in the iOS system, Apple had teamed up with Google to produce an app and launched it in May.</p>

<p>The software is used by a nation's health authority to build their own apps and has so far been given to 22 countries who requested access to the technology.</p>

<p>The tech partners noted that the app would be rolled out in two phases, with the first surfacing in with iOS 13.5 that required users to download a government app, MacRumors reports.</p>

<p>The beta version of iOS 13.7 was released to developers, showing the ability to turn on the alarms in 'Settings.' Exposure notifications apparently uses a smartphone’s Bluetooth to notify users when they come in close proximity to someone who has tested positive for the deadly virus</p>

<p>And it seems the second phase is set to hit the iPhone with the upcoming iOS 13.7.</p>

<p>Users will have the ability to toggle the COVID-19 Exposure Notifications on without installing another app on their device.</p>

<p>The move may be due to the lack of participation from the public, as for contact tracing apps to work, people must opt-in to use the service.</p>

<p>Virginia was the first US state to rollout Apple and Googles app, which went live earlier this month.</p>

<p>State officials said their new app, called Covidwise, will not work as well outside Virginia, at least until a group of coordinating public health agencies gets a national server up and running and other states join in. </p>

<p>A number of other states have expressed interest in the Apple-Google technology, including Alabama - which has begun pilot testing - South Carolina, North Dakota and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Google said earlier this month that there were 20 states and territories exploring an app using the framework. </p>

<p>Such apps have already launched in 16 countries and regions across Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and South America, the company said.</p>

<p>Canada and a number of countries in Europe and elsewhere have already rolled out apps using the tech companies' framework. </p>
