<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Judges dramatically reduced bail amounts as high as $1 million Thursday that had been set this week for several people accused of crimes during unrest in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, that included protests and vandalism to public buildings.</p>

<p>Bail for nine of 13 defendants was lowered, in several cases so they will not have to put up any money to be released, LNP reported.</p>

<p>Bail for two defendants was reduced from $1 million to $50,000 unsecured, clearing the way for their release pending trial.</p>

<p>Three other defendants received a $50,000 unsecured bail, allowing them to leave jail without putting up cash, but they are required to remain on house arrest until trial. </p>

<p>In other cases, defendants will still need to post bail of $25,000-$100,000, which means they may have to come up with a portion of it in cash to pay the bail bondsman.</p>

<p>District Court Judge Bruce Roth, who initially set the $1 million bonds, reviewed some of the bail petitions, and others were heard by Judge Dennis Reinaker.</p>

<p>During bail review, the court heard arguments from defense attorneys and prosecutors over each defendant's level of culpability, as well as their family circumstances and ties to the community. </p>

<p>The charges stem from unrest over the shooting by police of Ricardo Munoz, a Lancaster man who charged cops while wielding a knife after his sister sought to have him committed for mental health treatment.</p>

<p>Bail was unchanged for (left to right) Jessica Lopez, Frank Gaston and Matthew Modderman</p>

<p>Police body camera video that was made public shows the 27-year-old Munoz brandishing the knife before the officer shot and killed him. </p>

<p>Munoz had been awaiting trial on allegations he stabbed four people last year.</p>

<p>The charging documents filed by police over the demonstrators' actions described them all as instigators, which defendants' family members and supporters have in some cases hotly denied.</p>

<p>The protests Sunday night and early Monday were followed by rioting that caused damage to Lancaster's police headquarters and other downtown buildings. An arson fire blocked a downtown intersection.</p>

<p>Munoz had been out on bond, awaiting trial for allegations he stabbed four people last year, including a teenage boy who was stabbed in the face.</p>

<p>His sister said Munoz was mentally ill - diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia - and hadn't been taking his medications. </p>

<p>She said she had called a crisis intervention organization and a police non-emergency number to get her brother involuntarily committed.</p>

<p>Ricardo Munoz was fatally shot by an officer who authorities say was responding to a domestic disturbance call. He can be seen here holding a knife in his right hand</p>

<p>'He had an episode. He was just incoherent and acting out,' she said. 'I called to find out what the procedure was to get him some help.'  </p>

<p>Protesters gathered outside the police station in the wake of the shooting and, in video posted to social media, they chanted: "Hands up, don´t shoot," "No justice, no peace" and "What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!"</p>

<p>It was unclear how motivated protesters were by racism as they have been in other cities where deaths at the hands of police have stoked protest. </p>

<p>Court papers list Munoz's race as white. </p>
