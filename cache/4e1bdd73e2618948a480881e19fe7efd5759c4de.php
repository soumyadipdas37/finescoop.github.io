<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Donald Trump has accused Democrats of not wanting a vaccine against COVID-19 before the election, fearing that it will boost the president's chances of winning a second term.</p>

<p>Speaking to Fox News for an interview aired on Sunday night, Trump discussed the fight against coronavirus, fears over mail-in voting, and accused his opponent Joe Biden once again of being barely coherent.</p>

<p>The interview was recorded before Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death on Friday, and so host Mark Levin did not ask the president about the Supreme Court decision. </p>

<p>He opened his hour-long discussion with questions about coronavirus, as the United State edged towards the grim milestone of 200,000 dead.</p>

<p>Trump said he was confident the virus was going away, and was asked about Democrat attitudes towards a possible vaccine. </p>

<p>'They want to denigrate it, because they started hearing rumors about a vaccine in record time,' said Trump.</p>

<p>Donald Trump told Fox News' Mark Levin that Democrats did not want a quick COVID vaccine</p>

<p>The president said Democrats worried that a vaccine would boost Trump's election chances </p>

<p>'The reason they are doing this is because they think I'll get credit if we get a vaccine before the election.'</p>

<p>Trump said that his government had taken unprecedented steps to work for the speedy development of a vaccine. </p>

<p>'If this was a typical administration we wouldn't have a vaccine for two to three years,' he said. 'But I have changed it, safely. We have many companies doing it, in phase three trial.</p>

<p>'Instead of saying wow, this is great news, they are saying oh, it's coming out too soon, it won't be safe. These are big companies - they won't do that, they'll have tremendous liability.'</p>

<p>Trump said that seniors will be vaccinated first, prioritizing those with heart and respiratory conditions.   </p>

<p>Trump said he is hopeful of a vaccine being ready soon and rolled out swiftly</p>

<p>Trump also used his interview to mock, once again, his rival in November, Joe Biden.</p>

<p>He said the Democrat candidate 'barely knows he's alive', and was incapable of responding to events. </p>

<p>'He's losing the left now because he never mentions the words law and order,' said Trump.</p>

<p>'What we did in Minneapolis was incredible. National Guard - we sent them in - it was over in half an hour. Every one of these cities that has these problems is run by Democrats.' </p>

<p>Trump accused Biden of wanting to turn the United States into Venezuela, and said it would become 'Venezuela on steroids' if the Democrats win. </p>

<p>'And I used to say we’ll be another Venezuela, but I never really...I don’t know that I believed it fully,' he said. </p>

<p>'That wasn’t too long ago. But I do. </p>

<p>'If that kind of stuff gets put in, we will be another Venezuela, except on major steroids, OK?'</p>

<p>The president was asked about his frequently-voiced concerns over mail-in voting.</p>

<p>Trump repeated in his Sunday interview his long-held concerns about mail-in ballots</p>

<p>He warned once again that there will be a 'tremendous disruption' on Election Day, because voters were confused by the options for casting their ballots, and because of the risks of fraud.</p>

<p>'Look, they know it doesn't work because there have been many races using this over the last 14, 15 months - and I heard there was one yesterday or the day before yesterday, the ballots are so mixed up,' he said.</p>

<p>Trump said he was concerned of reports of 'missing' or fraudulent ballots.</p>

<p>'Now they have a new thing where they don't want to verify signatures because that makes it easier, so you don't have to verify a signature,' he said. </p>

<p>The president also accused some Democratic governors of being 'partisan' and 'political hacks' who are trying to sway the election toward his opponent.   </p>

<p>'It's a very tough situation,' he said.</p>

<p>'You look at these governors and you look at - I mean, I don't want to insult anybody, but take a look at some of these governors that are in charge of the ballots - beyond partisan - in many cases political hacks.'</p>

<p>Trump added that he has no issue with traditional absentee balloting, in that it is 'solicited,' but that many states like New Jersey and Nevada are mailing ballots out unsolicited.</p>

<p>'When they just dump millions of ballots all over the country, it's not going to work. It's going to be a disaster. And they know it,' he said. </p>

<p>'And we're talking about many millions of ballots. It's going to be mayhem. It's going to be bedlam, and this is what they want.'</p>

<p>The president used the interview to vent against John Bolton, describing him as 'a very stupid person' who wanted to take America into a new war.</p>

<p>John McCain, who died two years ago, also was a warmonger, Trump said.  </p>

<p>'If we listened to John McCain it would be World War Five now,' he said.</p>

<p>He boasted about having 'rebuilt our military', adding that he was confident that Russian president Vladimir Putin had a new-found respect for the U.S.  </p>

<p>'Nobody has been tougher on Russia than I have,' he said. 'I guarantee you Putin says that behind closed doors too.'   </p>
