<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Oregon's fire marshal has suddenly resigned amid an unprecedented and dangerous number of wildfires scorching through the state.</p>

<p>Marshal Jim Walker on Saturday submitted his resignation to State Police Superintendent Travis Hampton just hours after he was placed on administrative leave.</p>

<p>Oregon authorities had not publicly disclosed why Walker, whose held the position since 2014, was placed on administrative leave. </p>

<p>But a source told Oregon Live that Superintendent Hampton had lost confidence in Walker's ability to manage the wildfires that have inundated the West Coast.</p>

<p>This could be related to a report by Statesman Journal that Walker was reprimanded after he offered to search for an employee's relative affected by the Beachie Creek Fire.</p>

<p>Oregon officials announced on Saturday that Oregon Fire Marshal Jim Walker (left) resigned from his position and the role would be taken over by Chief Deputy Mariana Ruiz-Temple</p>

<p>Walker told the publication that it's difficult for deputies to search for people who have been burnt or killed in the fires - especially when it involves family members or children.</p>

<p>'So what I said is, "Let me go. Let me do this for you,"" he said. 'And so that's what I did.'</p>

<p>On Thursday, Walker traveled to Santiam Canyon to search for the employee's relative and an additional four people in the household. </p>

<p>An initial search with a member of the incident management team didn't find anyone, but they were able to make contact with the unaccounted people after getting phone numbers from a woman with knowledge of the situation. </p>

<p>Each person was aright, except for one person who remained unaccounted for.</p>

<p>'Superintendent Hampton's assessment was I overstepped my role and took this action without authority to do so,' said Walker. </p>

<p>Walker said he believed his search was cleared by the correct person, who was the operations chief of the incident management team for the Beachie Creek Fire.</p>

<p>Walker's resignation letter read: 'Following your conversation with me on Friday, September 11, I understand you have lost faith in my ability to meet leadership expectations in service to OSP. </p>

<p>'My hope was to continue supporting the Oregon Fire Service, even as we face unprecedented challenges. However, as this appears not possible, I am offering my resignation effective today, September 12, 2020.'</p>

<p>A source told Oregon Live that Walker had effectively passed the role's day-to-day duties to his chief deputy, Mariana Ruiz-Temple.</p>

<p>Ruiz-Temples was officially appointed as Oregon's new fire marshal, according to a statement from Oregon State Police.</p>

<p>'Mariana has led with grace, transparency and courage,' said Gov. Kate Brown, per the statement. 'She embodies the experience Oregon needs to face this crisis, in this moment.'</p>

<p>Superintendent Hampton said in a statement that the crisis faced by Oregonians at the moment 'necessitated a leadership change.'</p>

<p>'Mariana is assuming this position as Oregon is in an unprecedented crisis which demands an urgent response,' said Hampton.</p>

<p>'This response and the circumstances necessitated a leadership change. I have the absolute confidence in Mariana to lead OSFM operations through this critical time. </p>

<p>'She it tested, trusted and respected – having the rare combination of technical aptitude in field operations and administration.'</p>

<p>Linn County Commissioner John Lindsey told Oregon Live that the state has been absent in coordinating a response, but couldn't confirm if the lapse was linked to the leadership shakeup.</p>

<p>Typically when wildfires happen Oregon state officials take daily calls with county commissioners for updates, said Lindsey, but that hasn't happened this time around.</p>

<p>'The one consistent denominator missing was the state,' said Lindsey.</p>

<p>The detrimental wildfires that have taken over the Oregon's southern border have burnt one million acres across that state - about twice the annual average for the past decade.</p>

<p>According to Oregon's fire and hot spot dashboard, there are currently 14 active fires in the state.  </p>

<p>Six days of ongoing fires have forced thousands of Oregon residents to flee their homes as countless residences and businesses have already been destroyed. </p>

<p>In some parts of Oregon, around one-third of residents remained without power as a result of the wildfires.</p>

<p>Poor air quality has been found in Oregon, and California, that materialized in the form of frightening orange skies this week. </p>

<p>At least nine people have died in the wildfires, with three of the deaths attributed to the Almeda Fire, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports.  </p>

<p>Four people were confirmed dead on Saturday from the Beachie Creek Fire and one person died in the Holiday Farm Fire. </p>

<p>Hundreds of firefighters battled two large wildfires Friday that threatened to merge near the most populated part of the state, including the suburbs of Portland, causing the city to declare a state of emergency Thursday. </p>

<p>In California at least 20 have died and there has been at least one death reported in Washington state.</p>

<p>Four people have been arrested for arson for deliberately starting blazes along the West Coast while the states are already grappling with dozens of deadly blazes.         </p>
