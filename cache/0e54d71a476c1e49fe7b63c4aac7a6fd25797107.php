<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Woolworths stores have run out of Disney+ Ooshies after shoppers rushed to get their hands on the mini collectables. </p>

<p>Shoppers have posted their disappointment to the supermarket giant's Facebook page after they were told the Ooshies were out of stock at their local supermarkets. </p>

<p>Customers can receive one of the Ooshies for every $30 spent in store. There are 36 Disney+ Ooshies to collect, with the popular promotion combining the worlds of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars. </p>

<p>Woolworths said the Ooshies depletion was not happening at all stores but there had been 'isolated cases' at some supermarkets.  </p>

<p>One shopper said she focused her grocery shop on getting 'as many Ooshies as possible' but was left empty handed at the cash register.  </p>

<p>'I get to the checkout and pay for my shopping. I had to ask where the Ooshies were. The girl at the checkout informed me that there aren't any and they are probably not getting them back,' the shopper wrote on Facebook.</p>

<p>'Why are they still wearing promotion T-shirts and the store is still covered in Ooshie stuff?</p>

<p>'I could have saved money by selecting cheaper products but paid the extra on a different brand to get these darn things for my nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>'I am absolutely feeling ripped off!'</p>

<p>Another 'disappointed' customer said their daughter was left in tears because their local Woolworths had run dry of Ooshies. </p>

<p>Customers can receive one of the Ooshies for every $30 spent in store. There are 36 Disney+ Ooshies to collect, with the popular promotion combining the worlds of Disney, Pixar, Marvel and Star Wars</p>

<p>'I understand this happens but when there is nothing to say they are out and the store is full of signs about Ooshies it is not unreasonable to expect them to be there,' they wrote.</p>

<p>'And the unhelpful and disinterested person who served me didn't tell me until I asked for my Oohsies, so I didn't have the option of returning items I had only bought for the bonus Ooshies.</p>

<p>'Disappointing all round really.'</p>

<p>One shopper claimed they visited three different Woolworths stores but still couldn't get their hands on the collectables.</p>

<p>'It would be a good idea if you advertised the fact you are out of Ooshies. Three stores today and they had none. Bit of a ploy to get people to spend $30,'</p>

<p>Woolworths said the Ooshies depletion was not happening at all stores but there had been 'isolated cases' at some supermarkets</p>

<p>Another wrote: 'Oh no, your Caloundra store has run out of Ooshies. I just called the store to find out why they were not supplied on my online order. Can anyone from head office tell me when more stock is arriving? I am owed 16 on this order.'</p>

<p>Woolworths shoppers can check with the service desk at their local store to confirm Ooshies availability.</p>

<p>A spokesperson said: 'We're thrilled Woolworths customers are enjoying our Disney+ Ooshies and we've seen enormous demand across the country since we launched the program.</p>

<p>'Some stores have seen spikes in redemption over the last few days and we are working to replenish their stock in the days ahead.</p>

<p>'We thank customers for their patience and understanding given the popularity of the Disney+ Ooshies.' </p>
