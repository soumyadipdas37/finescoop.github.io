<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A photo contest has exposed some of the nation's messiest bedrooms - including clothes stored on the 'floordrobe', week's worth of old pizza boxes, and too much clutter.  </p>

<p>BedSOS is scouring the UK to find the most offending rooms, with the competition closing on the 14th September, and the lucky winner receiving a brand new bed worth up to £400. </p>

<p>Danny Richmond, Managing Director of Bed SOS, said: 'We've seen a lot in our time, but even we were shocked by the state of some of the bedrooms in the entries so far. </p>

<p>'With all the extra time people have been spending at home recently, it does make sense that things will be a little more cluttered than usual, but some of these take the cake!'</p>

<p>Below, FEMAIL takes a look at some of the untidiest entries so far and if nothing else, at least they know they're in good company!  </p>

<p>Louise Merrick from Hampshire's teenage son doesn't seem to mind the clutter - as long as he can play his video games</p>

<p>Complete with a messy bed and trip hazards all over the floor, Emily Parkin, from London, claims this is her 'friend's bedroom'... but we're not sure if we believe her</p>

<p>Leeds dad, Phil Newis, sent in this shot of his 10-year-old daughter's messy den</p>

<p>Thomas Hall's bedroom in Boston, Lincolnshire, could definitely do with a little TLC</p>

<p>Clearly a fan of pink, Becca Walton from Doncaster's little girl needs a bigger wardrobe</p>

<p>Another keen gamer, Michelle Baker from Birmingham's son could definitely do with a de-clutter</p>

<p>Doncaster local Sally-Ann Johnston has documented her son's pigsty from every angle</p>

<p>London girl Elaine Hamilton's daughter has a special place to keep her hair extensions, but could do with the same attitude for the rest of her bedroom</p>

<p>Heather Kinsman's bedroom in Stanstead Abbotts seems to have everything except the kitchen sink</p>

<p>With her home in the middle of renovations, Elly Fitchett's bedroom in Shrewsbury is the only room in her house with electricity, so it's doubling up as a living room…and kitchen!</p>
