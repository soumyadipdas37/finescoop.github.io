<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has warned publicly-funded museums and galleries not to remove statues at the demand of activists as he hinted they could have their funding cut. </p>

<p>Mr Dowden said in a leaked letter that the 'Government does not support the removal of statues or other similar objects'. </p>

<p>He said museums and galleries which receive taxpayer support 'should not be taking actions motivated by activism or politics' as he urged them to resist pressure. </p>

<p>He urged institutions to 'continue to act impartially', something he described as 'especially important' as the Government conducts its Comprehensive Spending Review - an apparent threat that funding could be at risk. </p>

<p>Mr Dowden's letter, seen by the Sunday Telegraph, comes after a summer of cultural clashes over Britain's colonial past. </p>

<p>A leaked letter from Oliver Dowden to museums and galleries has warned them against removing statues</p>

<p>A summer of cultural clashes in the UK saw a statue of the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston toppled in Bristol and thrown into the city's harbour</p>

<p>The letter was reportedly sent to all institutions which receive public funding, including the British Museum and Tate galleries.         </p>

<p>Mr Dowden said in the letter sent last week: 'The Government does not support the removal of statues or other similar objects. </p>

<p>'Historic England, as the Government's adviser on the historic environment, have said that removing difficult and contentious parts of it risks harming our understanding of our collective past.'</p>

<p>The letter continued: 'As publicly funded bodies, you should not be taking actions motivated by activism or politics. </p>

<p>'The significant support that you receive from the taxpayer is an acknowledgement of the important cultural role you play for the entire country. </p>

<p>'It is imperative that you continue to act impartially, in line with your publicly funded status, and not in a way that brings this into question.</p>

<p>'This is especially important as we enter a challenging Comprehensive Spending Review, in which all government spending will rightly be scrutinised.'</p>

<p>A row over Britain's colonial past erupted in June as protests saw a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston toppled in Bristol. </p>

<p>The bronze statue of the 17th century figure was pulled down with ropes, dragged through the streets and thrown into the harbour during a Black Lives Matter protest.  </p>

<p>A statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, Westminster, was also daubed with graffiti amid wider calls for controversial figures to have their statues taken down. </p>

<p>Boris Johnson hit out at the demands to remove statues at the time as he said 'we cannot now try to edit or censor our past'. </p>

<p>The Prime Minister said the UK 'cannot pretend to have a different history' and that the statues 'teach us about our past, with all its faults'.</p>

<p>Earlier this month the Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg blasted the National Trust for not realising 'how wonderful' Churchill was after it included his home on its 'woke' list of houses with historic links to slavery.  </p>
