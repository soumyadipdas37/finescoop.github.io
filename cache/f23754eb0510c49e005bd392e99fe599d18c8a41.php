<p>She added: 'I spent my critical coming-of-age years working in the entertainment and modelling industry.</p>

<p>'These environments did bring many unhealthy influences and conditionings, but I take full responsibility for what outside influences created in my world.'</p>

<p>Isabelle went on to explain that she hadn't yet understood or accepted the 'true beauty of the human form' as a teenager and young adult.</p>

<p>She concluded by saying people were 'more than any size or number' and urged fans to 'tune in' to their 'inner world'.</p>
