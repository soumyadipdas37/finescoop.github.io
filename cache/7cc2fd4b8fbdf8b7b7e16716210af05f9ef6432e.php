<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Six Madrid cops have been filmed forcing a woman into a police car and hitting her head off the vehicle during an arrest for not wearing a mask.  </p>

<p>The unidentified woman was seized in the Spanish capital on Saturday during protests by hundreds of coronavirus deniers.</p>

<p>It is not clear if the woman was participating in the demonstrations but those watching could be heard shouting, 'Libertad!'  </p>

<p>The onlookers could be heard groaning when officers rammed the woman headlong into the vehicle as she put up staunch resistance. </p>

<p>The unidentified woman was detained in the Spanish capital on Saturday during protests by hundreds of coronavirus deniers (pictured: struggling with officers before being shoved into the back of the police car)</p>

<p>'I am not going to put on the face mask,' the woman yelled at the officers at the beginning of the encounter. </p>

<p>After showing no signs of compliance, officers led the screaming woman into their patrol car, but were unable to place her inside and she yelled to the onlookers, 'Film them!'</p>

<p>After officers were forced to wrestle with the suspect for about a minute, some witnesses can be heard criticising them for being too rough.</p>

<p>Several cops were seen placing their hands on top of the woman's head to try to put her in the car while she shouted for help.</p>

<p>The police were eventually able to place her inside the vehicle after picking her up and sliding her in horizontally.</p>

<p>Several witnesses then start chanting 'Freedom' after she was finally placed inside the vehicle and officers quickly closed the door after her.</p>

<p>It is unclear if there is an open investigation on the incident.</p>

<p>Authorities report around 500 people attended the COVID-19 conspiracy march which they organised via social media and did not notify the government.</p>

<p>The woman provided staunch resistance to the officers who resorted to forcefully shoving her head into the side of their vehicle</p>

<p>Police claim they identified 110 people who were not wearing masks.</p>

<p>The protest resulted in 13 detentions, however, it is unclear if the woman's arrest was included in this number.</p>

<p>The people arrested for not wearing their masks face a fine between £260 and £535.</p>

<p>Spain has recorded the second highest number of cases of the disease in Europe with 498,989 and the fourth most deaths, with 29,418 fatalities.</p>
