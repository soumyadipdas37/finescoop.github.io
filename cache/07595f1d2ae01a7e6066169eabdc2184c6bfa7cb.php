<p>Endometriosis condition: Olivia, shown in February in Los Angeles, revealed last month on her Instagram Stories that she suffers from endometriosis</p>

<p>Work time: 'We're here in my new office space,' Olivia told her roughly 4.7 million followers on Instagram</p>

<p>Mask treatment: The beauty queen also was getting a facial mask treatment in the tub</p>

<p>'I was shocked to see how many women have also suffered from endometriosis, and how many questions women have about painful periods. They're not normal, and they could get in the way of your fertility,' she added.</p>

<p>The Miss USA 2012 and Miss Universe 2012 winner was diagnosed last year with endometriosis, in which tissue that normally lines the uterus grows outside the uterus.</p>

<p>She noted that endometriosis can be 'very difficult' to diagnose and advised women to get their egg count checked and to make sure their painful periods aren't affecting either their ovaries or eggs. </p>

<p>Painful cramps: Olivia revealed last month on social media that she suffers from endometriosis and its painful cramps</p>

<p>'Down the line, it's so heartbreaking when you think about someone who maybe could have taken action earlier, and now they can't have children. That to me just feels awful,' she said.</p>

<p>The Reprisal star revealed that she wasn't considering laparoscopic surgery to treat her endometriosis.</p>

<p>'I'm trying to do the holistic route as of now,' Culpo said.</p>

<p>She added: 'I want to try to see if I can figure some things out for myself, but we'll see. It's a journey. Every month is different because I try different things every month. But I'll definitely keep everybody posted on what works for me, and eventually having to get the surgery because it really depends. Everyone's different.'</p>

<p>Olivia has been dating pro football player Christian McCaffrey, 24, for about a year.</p>
