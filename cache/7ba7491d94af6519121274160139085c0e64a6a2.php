<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Most people walking into this modern apartment block in London would see nothing but beautifully designed homes.</p>

<p>But there are some hidden interior designer references in the entrance hallway that also pay homage to its unique TV history.</p>

<p>In particular, the pink and green chairs found in the communal entrance may seem like nothing more than a subtle accent colour in the design scheme.</p>

<p>But they have much greater meaning as they represent the colours of the children's TV characters Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy.</p>

<p>A one-bedroom flat in the Henson Building, London, is for sale for £550,000</p>

<p>Pink and Green chairs: The interior design pays homage to the building's TV history</p>

<p>The site used to be a puppet workshop owned by the characters' creator Jim Henson. It was converted into modern flats, many of which were sold off-plan a decade ago.</p>

<p>One of those flats is now back on the market, with a price tag of £550,000. It includes one bedroom, a bathroom and an open-plan living area with a balcony.</p>

<p> Jim Henson was the creator of TV children's characters Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy</p>

<p>The flat has a 24-hour concierge and is leasehold, with 985 years remaining on the lease. It has an exposed brick wall, oak flooring and underfloor heating in the bathroom.</p>

<p>In the living room and bedroom, an in-ceiling remote controlled speaker system has been installed.</p>

<p>The flat is part of The Henson Building, which is in London's uber-cool Camden, and less than half a mile from the shops and cafes of Primrose Hill.</p>

<p>It has good access to transport, being 0.3 miles from Camden Town underground station, which is on the Northern Line.</p>

<p>The average price of a property in this part of the capital is £831,311, compared to £308,813 for the country as a whole, according to property website Zoopla.</p>

<p>Jim Henson used to run a workshop on the site called the Creature Shop</p>

<p>This flat in the Henson Building has some sleek finishes including the steel kitchen</p>

<p>The flat has an open-plan living area with oak flooring and an exposed brick wall</p>

<p>Jim Henson ran his Creature Shop in London from 1978 to 2005. The special effects shop and puppet workshop is now based in Los Angeles and New York.</p>

<p>It also provides digital visual effects, animation and soft puppets to the international film, television, online and advertising industries. </p>

<p>Although, the workshop was primarily associated with realistic monsters and animals, the Creature Shop also occasionally built figures for Muppet productions, such as for the The Muppet Christmas Carol.  </p>

<p>Among the best known Muppet Show characters are Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. </p>

<p>Kermit the Frog is the main character in numerous Muppet productions, including Sesame Street and The Muppet Show, while The Muppet Show character Miss Piggy is best known for her diva superstar personality, tendency to use French phrases and her practice of karate.</p>

<p>The flat has a balcony, which has room for a chair to sit and enjoy the sunshine</p>

<p>There is a generously-sized bedroom in the flat, which is being sold via estate agents Savills</p>

<p>Warm designer touches: The modern bathroom has underfloor heating</p>

<p>Lauren Shields, of estate agents Savills - which is handling the sale – said: 'This stunning apartment, set within the renowned Henson Building, offers buyers the rare chance to own a piece of movie history, which was the birthplace to some of the most iconic fantasy films ever made.</p>

<p>'And while the magical creatures brought to life by the Jim Henson Company no longer walk the corridors, it is safe to say that they have left a long-lasting mark for those living there to this day.</p>

<p>'You only have to step foot inside the building to see a green and a pink chair gracing the lobby, which pays homage to two of Henson's most iconic characters.</p>

<p>'But beyond its previous life as the London Creature Workshop, this apartment offers exceptional loft-like features and a great location in the heart of ever vibrant Camden, while also being close to the fashionable shops and cafes of Primrose Hill.'</p>

<p>The flat is less than half a mile from the shops and cafes of Primrose Hill</p>
