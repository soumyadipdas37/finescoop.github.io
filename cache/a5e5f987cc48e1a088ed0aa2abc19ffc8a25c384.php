<p>'I've definitely kind of experimented more': Bachelor vet Taylor Nolan is experimenting with 'poly-type relationships'</p>

<p>For Taylor, who describes herself as 'pretty single and safely mingling', love doesn't always come in a neat little box.    </p>

<p>'I've definitely kind of experimented more with poly-type relationships,' she continued. 'And love doesn't have to present itself in this fairy tale, heterosexual, non-monogamous dynamic. Like, it can look many different ways… If you're hot, you're hot.' </p>

<p>'Trans people are hot, non-binary people are hot, men are hot, women are hot. Like, it's a full spectrum of attractiveness,' she continued.  </p>

<p>Taylor elaborated on her newfound experimentation following her appearance on Instagram, where she posted a beaming selfie.</p>

<p>'I'm still always learning': Taylor elaborated on her newfound experimentation following her appearance on Instagram, where she posted a beaming selfie</p>

<p>In the caption, Taylor revealed she was still learning to more open with her sexuality.  </p>

<p>'I'm still always learning,' she wrote. 'Learning and figuring out what it is to be in and create a relationship that is monogamous or consensually non-monogamous or monogamish. </p>

<p>'Learning to be embracing and accepting of experiencing sexual attraction to people when I think they're hot, and not just limiting attraction based on gender (but yes I do still love me a good beard lol). Learning to be a constant student of life, where I'll be wrong and I'll be right and I'll struggle and I'll grow....cause that's what it's all about, isn't it?⁣' </p>
