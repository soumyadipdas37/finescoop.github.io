<p>Sylvain Helaine was teaching at the Docteur Morere Elementary School in Palaiseau, a suburb of Paris, last year when the parents of a three-year-old complained to educational authorities.</p>

<p>They said their son, who was not taught by Helaine, had nightmares after seeing him.</p>

<p>It was ruled that the 35-year-old, who is considered to be France's most tattooed man, could continue teaching but only for children over the age of six.  </p>

<p>Sylvain Helaine was teaching at the Docteur Morere Elementary School in Palaiseau, a suburb of Paris, last year when the parents of a three-year-old complained to educational authorities</p>

<p>The parents argued that their young son, who was not taught by Helaine, had nightmares after seeing him</p>

<p>It was eventually ruled that the 35-year-old, who is considered to be France 's most tattooed man, could continue teaching but only for children over the age of six</p>

<p>Helaine, who was born in Paris, got his first ink when he was 27 and has since spent over £35,000 and around 460 hours under the tattooists' needle.</p>

<p>He said that in the months following the complaint the school authorities informed him he would no longer teach kindergarten children. </p>

<p>'I think the decision they took was quite sad,' said Helaine, before claiming that pupils can see past his appearance after the initial shock.</p>

<p>'All of my students and their parents were always cool with me because basically they knew me,' he added. </p>

<p>Helaine, who was born in Paris, got his first ink when he was 27 and has since spent over £35,000 and around 460 hours under the tattooists' needle</p>

<p>He said he started getting tattoos when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an 'existential crisis'</p>

<p> Helaine, who has had his tongue tattooed and the whites of his eyes surgically turned black, said he would stick with his chosen career despite the setbacks</p>

<p>'It's only when people see me from far away that they can assume the worst.'</p>

<p>A spokesman for the local education authority said an agreement was reached with Helaine to move him away from teaching kindergarten. </p>

<p>Pupils under six 'could be frightened by his appearance', the spokesman said. </p>

<p>Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career despite the setbacks. 'I'm a primary school teacher... I love my job.' </p>

<p>Helanie has spent more than £35,000 covering his body in tattoos and getting the whites of his eyes surgically turned black</p>

<p>He said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm</p>

<p>He said he started getting tattoos when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an 'existential crisis'. </p>

<p>Since then, he said that getting tattoos had become a passion. </p>

<p>Helaine, whose alias is Freaky Hoody, said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. </p>

<p>'Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,' he added.</p>
