<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Jealousy and competition for Locky Gilbert quickly turned friends Bella Varelis and Irena Srbinovska into enemies on this season of The Bachelor. </p>

<p>And on Thursday, evicted intruder Bec Cvilikas weighed in on the feud that divided the mansion.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Kyle and Jackie O Show, Bec revealed Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, have still not patched up their friendship, despite filming the show months ago.</p>

<p>'They don't talk': Bec Cvilikas (pictured) has revealed why The Bachelor finalists Irena and Bella have no plans to patch up their friendship anytime soon</p>

<p>'They don't talk, they definitely don't talk,' she said, when was asked if there was still bad blood between the two.</p>

<p>'There's no like full on bad blood, they're not b**ching about each other,' she continued. </p>

<p>'I don't think anything will ever be patched up to be honest. Everything is too far gone with them.'</p>

<p> Not friends: Speaking on the Kyle and Jackie O Show, Bec revealed Bella, 25, and Irena, 31, have still not patched up their friendship, despite filming the show months ago</p>

<p>Bec also told the KIIS 106.5 radio hosts Bella, 25, wasn't happy with how she was portrayed on the show.</p>

<p>'She's been pretty upset to be honest. It's not nice when people have been making up such insane rumours about her.'</p>

<p>'The way Bella has been portrayed, there are missing pieces. She's not a villain or a bad guy,' Bec added.</p>

<p>When asked if there was a side to Irena audiences didn't see, Bec explained: 'There's no good and bad guy in this whole situation.'</p>

<p>'I think maybe people saw Bella as the Disney princess at the beginning and jealousy plays a massive part of this show this sometimes, and this was their way of tearing her down.'   </p>

<p>Bella and Irena's feud began shortly after the contestants returned to the mansion after three and a half months of lockdown.</p>

<p>On-site production of The Bachelor was suspended from mid-March until the first week of July, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>During the first post-lockdown cocktail party, a furious Bella, 25, accused Irena, 31, of lying about the extent of her contact with Locky during self-isolation and called her a 'manipulative little b***h'.</p>

<p>The Bachelor finale airs Thursday at 7.30pm on Channel 10 </p>

<p>Heartbreak ahead: In the teaser, both women go into the finale rather confident after Locky tells them both that he loves them</p>
