<p>Combining the power of a dryer with the volume of a styler, the Revlon One Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser is a super-quick way of creating swingy, bouncy hair without the salon prices.   </p>

<p>If you've never mastered or even held a round brush before, then the Revlon One Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser is a great introduction, with shoppers raving about how easy it is to use.</p>

<p>'I’m no expert and cannot use a brush and a hairdryer at the same time to dry my hair and usually just use a hairdryer with my head upside down!</p>

<p>I used this for the first time this week and had so many compliments about my hair! It felt so silky and swishy and really felt like I’d had a blow dry at the hairdressers! I have fine hair but it’s long and there’s a lot of it. I didn’t get an arm ache and it took me about 20 mins to dry it using the low setting.'</p>

<p>With the Revlon 2-in-1 styler there is no need to juggle a brush and a hair dryer at the same time</p>

<p>Since the two-in-one hair tool combines both dryer and a brush, it cuts down the time it takes to style your hair- not to mention you don't have to apply heat twice, as it blow-dries and straightens your hair simultaneously. </p>

<p>Amazon shoppers with both straight and curly hair have reported impressive results with the Revlon One Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser. </p>

<p>'This 'amazing' gadget is a must have girls!!! My hair is naturally curly and took me 20 minutes to dry and style. Very lightweight. Drys easily and styles as you use it. My hair is silky and looks in excellent condition. Not frizzy as I thought it would turn out to be. I can honestly say it’s worth every penny!.'</p>

<p>Another shopper raved: 'This brush is everything I've been looking for. I have plenty of hair but it's very fine and gets frizzy even though it's straight. Having to blow dry it and then use a straightener can be a pain, not to mention time consuming and damaging for the hair. This brush was the answer to my problems.'</p>

<p>A third happy customer wrote: 'WOW! OK, I followed the reviews as I did not want to spend a stupid amount of money on a certain vacuum brand's new product. I had my doubts but by golly this is pretty good. For once I have soft, sleek hair. It’s that bouncy, swingy hair that I only get following a salon blow dry.'</p>
