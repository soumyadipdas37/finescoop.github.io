<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Twitter users despaired last night as the first presidential debate descended into an unappetizing shouting match between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. </p>

<p>Viewers longed for moderator Chris Wallace to turn off the candidates' microphones like a Zoom call as the two nominees treated the host 'like an inner city substitute teacher' and constantly talked over each other during the 90-minute clash. </p>

<p>One voter adapted a joke from The Simpsons to summarize the debate with the newspaper headline: 'Old Man Yells At Old Man'. </p>

<p>Another simply shared a picture of a weeping American continent - as the country readies itself for two more debates before the November 3 election.   </p>

<p>Twitter users despaired last night as the first presidential debate descended into an unappetizing shouting match between Donald Trump and Joe Biden</p>

<p>'It's safe to say that we're in trouble,' one viewer said as he posted a mocked-up picture of Trump and Biden as young children.  </p>

<p>Astronomer Antonio Paris posted a picture of himself in a spacesuit and joked: 'I'm literally moving to Mars in the morning. Who's with me?'. </p>

<p>Kaniela Ing remarked that 'there is one clear loser in this debate: Chris Wallace' after the moderator struggled to keep order. </p>

<p>Some viewers reacted with relief when the debate finally ended, with one posting an image of Frodo celebrating the Dark Lord's demise in Lord of the Rings. </p>

<p>Others wished the candidates could have had their microphones turned off, with David Sinclair joking that Wallace should have had on-and-off switches for Trump and Biden. </p>

<p>Journalist Jen Ortiz offered a 'free idea', saying: 'Mute the mics when they're not supposed to be talking have we learned nothing from Zoom'. </p>

<p>Hannah Jewell commented: 'I think this might be more productive if they just wrestled.' </p>

<p>One viewer imagined further chaos with an image of long-shot candidate Kanye West appearing to take the microphone. </p>

<p>Another imagined the view from north of the border, with an imaginary Canadian responding with the comment: 'This is f***ed'.  </p>

<p>The debate in Cleveland, Ohio, was as bad-tempered as had been feared, with Trump leading the way in yelling over his challenger and the moderator alike.</p>

<p>Trump went as hard on 77-year-old Biden as he'd threatened, saying the 'radical left' had the centrist Democrat 'wrapped around their little finger.'</p>

<p>And he got personal, seeking to rile the former vice president by accusing one of his sons of corruption, and telling Biden that 'there's nothing smart' about him. </p>

<p>Viewers longed for moderator Chris Wallace to turn off the candidates' microphones like a Zoom call as the two nominees treated the host 'like an inner city substitute teacher' and constantly talked over each other during the 90-minute clash</p>

<p>Biden hit back by launching the kind of attack on Trump which the billionaire president has rarely had to endure to his face.</p>

<p>'Liar,' 'racist' and 'clown' were just some of the missiles launched from Biden, who also branded Trump the 'puppy' of Russian President Vladimir Putin.</p>

<p>At one point an exasperated Biden, who leads strongly in the polls, turned to Trump and said: 'Will you shut up, man!' </p>

<p>At times, neither Biden nor Wallace could get a word in, as Trump loudly touted his economic record and went after Biden's son Hunter.</p>

<p>Trump had spread theories right up until the last minute that Biden would need drugs or an earpiece secretly providing answers to get through the night.</p>

<p>The anger-filled event did nothing to calm fears around the country that the presidential election, taking place in the middle of an ongoing coronavirus pandemic, could end in chaos.</p>

<p>Asked by Wallace whether they pledged to urge calm and refrain from declaring victory if the results are not immediately known November 3, Biden said: 'Yes.'</p>

<p>Trump, though, wouldn't commit, saying that if he saw 'tens of thousands of ballots being manipulated, I can't go along with that.'</p>

<p>And when asked if he condemned far-right armed militias like the Proud Boys group, Trump gave a cryptic reply: 'Proud Boys - stand back and stand by.' </p>
