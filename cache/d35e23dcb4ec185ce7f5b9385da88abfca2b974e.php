<p>Earlier in the week, Boris Johnson said groups of more than six people will be banned from meeting as of Monday in what he called a 'rule of six'.  </p>

<p>Lamenting the new rule change, the I'm A Celeb champ - who turns 30 next month - admitted the news was wreaking havoc on her anxiety. </p>

<p>Upsetting: Scarlett Moffatt has revealed the new Covid restrictions have ruined her 30th birthday plans and played havoc with her anxiety</p>

<p>Taking to her Instagram Stories, Scarlett confessed: 'My anxiety is so bad now because of this news. Anyone else feel like living in another country for a year'.</p>

<p>Taking aim at the government's guidance, she continued: 'So they told us to go out and do help out to eat out. Now they're saying we have to stay in! What is happening man!'</p>

<p>Sharing a snap of herself watching Boris' address she raged: '30th birthday plans ruined, wish corona would just F**K OFF NOW.' </p>

<p>Oh dear: Earlier in the week, Boris Johnson said groups of more than six people will be banned from meeting as of Monday in what he called a 'rule of six'</p>

<p>She continued: 'I know I like to spread positivity, but I can't lie to you all, I've never felt so crap in my life. Boris announcement has seriously knocked me [sic]. Hope you're all ok'. </p>

<p>'And to those who are feeling like me and are struggling, don't feel ashamed about it. What's happening is strange and crap. It's a natural reaction.</p>

<p>'Also side note - the fact all my 30th birthday plans have been cancelled means I can stay 29 for another year?' </p>

<p>Upsetting: Lamenting the new rule change, the I'm A Celeb champ - who turns 30 next month - admitted the news was wreaking havoc on her anxiety</p>

<p>Candid: Scarlett discussed the impact the latest restrictions have had on her mental health as she urged any one who is struggling not to feel ashamed</p>

<p>As of Monday, no more than six people will be permitted to gather in England - with a few exceptions, which include going to school, work, or 'exceptional life events'.</p>

<p>Breaking these new restrictions will mean fines of £100, doubling for each incident up to £3,200. </p>

<p>The law has been different to the official 'guidance' since July 4, which has been a source of confusion among some. Now, official rules are closer - yet not entirely in sync - with the state's advice. </p>

<p>Scarlett's comments come shortly after she threw her mother Betty a fabulous 50th birthday celebration complete with a pop-up pub and silent disco. </p>

<p>With existing coronavirus restrictions still in place, only 30 people could come to the party but Scarlett along with her father Mark and sister Ava, 14, made the most of the day.  </p>

<p>The pop-up had a real bar with staff pouring drinks while Scarlett's boyfriend Scott Dobinson also helping out with the festivities.</p>

<p>Scarlett also organised entertainment for the day, with a swing dancer and keyboardist serenading the audience before a disco began later in the evening.   </p>

<p>All together: Scarlett's comments come after she threw her mum Betty a fabulous 50th birthday celebration with a pop-up pub and disco with the help of her Mark and sister Ava, 14</p>
