<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>An Australian woman has stunned the internet after sharing a photo of her grandmother that has been highly edited using iPhone applications - and warned against taking photos on the internet at face value.</p>

<p>The woman, who lives in Queensland, shared the image of her grandmother to Facebook, saying she 'couldn't believe' the edited version was possible. </p>

<p>'My mum is into editing photos and she managed to edit my grandma's face into a complete different person,' she said.</p>

<p>'Never trust photos on the internet... By the way she only used apps on iPhone, it's not even Photoshop.'</p>

<p>The lady, who lives in Queensland, shared the image of her grandmother to Facebook, saying she 'couldn't believe' the edited version was possible</p>

<p>While it's not known how old her grandmother is she is holding up a seniors card in the photo, which is distributed to people over the age of 60.</p>

<p>The edited version of her grandmother has long brown hair, a fringe, poreless skin, rosy red lips and big brown eyes, making her look like a woman in her 20s.</p>

<p>The photo has gone viral online with almost 2,500 people commenting or tagging their friends in the picture in disbelief. </p>

<p>'Hun that's not editing anymore that's Photoshopping... you might as well just overlay another face onto hers at this point since they don't look the same in any way,' one person said.</p>

<p>'Which app is this though because I'd like to look presentable on zoom,' said another.</p>

<p>A third joked: 'This will be me in 50 years editing on Snapchat'.</p>

<p>Some argued that technology was 'too powerful' if it could make changes this drastic, but at the the same time plenty wanted to know what apps were used.</p>

<p>The original poster has yet to confirm how her mother managed to make the physical changes on her mobile phone.</p>

<p>However, MeituPic is a Chinese smartphone-based photo-editing app that allows users to tweak their selfies with Instagram-like filters, Snapchat-style stickers and facial feature enhancement tools, similar to what has been done here.</p>

<p>The app has 456 million users, who use it to post more than 6 billion photos every month, Jing Daily reported.</p>

<p>Another app, Makeup Plus, uses augmented reality technology to accurately detect a user's facial features and apply virtual makeup, including eyeshadow, mascara products and even hair styles.</p>

<p>This would explain how her grandmother's eyes, hair and lips changed in the second photo. </p>
