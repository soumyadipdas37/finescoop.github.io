<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Shane Duffy insisted on Wednesday night that he has joined Celtic to create history after completing his one-year loan deal from Brighton.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old central back, whose signing was exclusively revealed by Sportsmail on Monday, was Neil Lennon’s top defensive target throughout the summer. Now he has fulfilled his boyhood dream after telling his parent club he had no interest in moving anywhere else.</p>

<p>Currently in Bulgaria with the Republic of Ireland ahead of their Nations League match on Thursday night, the former Everton and Blackburn player won’t meet up with his new Parkhead team-mates until after Stephen Kenny’s side face Finland in Dublin on Sunday. </p>

<p>Shane Duffy has revealed that he joined Celtic for the chance to make history with the club</p>

<p>Acutely aware of the high-stakes game he’s signed up for in Glasgow, he’s vowed to embrace the challenge of helping Celtic complete ten-in-a-row - a feat that would grant Lennon’s squad a place in club folklore.</p>

<p>‘It’s a huge season,’ said Duffy. ‘You don’t need a reason to go to Celtic but if ever there was a reason it’s this year and the chance to make history.</p>

<p>‘It’s something I’ve followed every year and to get the chance to be part of it is a huge honour but there’s a lot of hard work to do.</p>

<p>‘I really am delighted to sign this deal with Celtic. It is a huge honour for me to join such a huge institution and a brilliant football club that I have always loved and admired.</p>

<p>‘It will be a fantastic personal moment for me when I pull on the Celtic jersey. It’s just a great feeling - I could not be happier to be part of the club now and I just can’t wait to start working with the manager, the staff and the players when I return from international duty with Ireland.</p>

<p>Duffy is eager to impress for Celtic, who are chasing a tenth Scottish league title in succession</p>

<p>‘We will be challenging on a lot of fronts this season and I am really excited about getting going, as we try and bring the fans more and more success.’</p>

<p>Revealing the part that fellow Derry man and former Celtic player Paddy McCourt played in reassuring him over the past few weeks, Duffy added: ‘Paddy’s been great for me. I spoke to him a couple of weeks ago when it was all happening.</p>

<p>‘He had great words to say about the career he had at Celtic. If I had half of that, I’d be delighted. He’s a huge role model. Paddy, and he had many great things to say about the club.</p>

<p>‘People know the Celtic-Derry connection - the club was all we knew growing up. (I was) lucky enough to go to a few games there and soak in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>‘It’s my boyhood club. Always a dream as a kid to play for Celtic.</p>

<p>Duffy revealed that former Celtic player Paddy McCourt helped to convince him to join</p>

<p>‘I have all the tops over the years. To experience Celtic Park, it’s a huge honour, and I’m very proud.’</p>

<p>On the prospect of playing for Lennon, Duffy said: ‘I can’t wait to get working with him.</p>

<p>‘I followed his career all the way through watching him play for the club. It will be a real honour to play under him.’</p>

<p>Duffy will now offer stiff competition for Christopher Jullien and Kristoffer Ajer at the heart of Lennon’s defence.</p>

<p>Celtic manager Neil Lennon welcomed the signing of Duffy, describing him as 'a warrior'</p>

<p>His signing comes after the club landed Vasilis Barkas, David Turnbull and Albian Ajeti on permanent deals while securing another year’s loan for Mohamed Elyounoussi - a combined outlay of around £15million.</p>

<p>‘We are delighted to bring a player of Shane’s quality to Celtic,’ said Lennon, after the Irish FA put the player through his medical in Dublin.</p>

<p>‘He is an international player with so many great attributes. He is a leader and he’s a warrior - someone with real ability and who will also give us that great physical presence.</p>

<p>‘I know, too, he is a player who will add great personality to the dressing room. This is a real coup for the club. From the off, Shane wanted to come to Celtic and we are delighted we have been able to fend off English Premier League interest.</p>

<p>‘We are delighted with Shane’s decision to come and I am delighted with the business which Nick Hammond and the board have done, not only in bringing Shane to Celtic, but throughout the window.</p>

<p>‘We can’t wait to get Shane involved in the squad as we look to the many challenges ahead.’</p>
