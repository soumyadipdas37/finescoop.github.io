<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>A mother who restored her grime-ridden grouting to perfect condition with a $22 gel from Bunnings has saved $770 by shunning cleaners and doing the job herself.</p>

<p>After professionals quoted $792 to clean the tiled floor of her Queensland home, the mum bought a two-litre bottle of 'Long Life Grout Cleaner' and got to work with a scrubbing brush. </p>

<p>Photos posted in a Facebook cleaning group show the result of her efforts, with just a few seconds of scrubbing lifting the blackened dirt caked into the grouting between each tile.</p>

<p>'Just finished four tiles and I cannot believe I didn't do this years ago,' she wrote in the caption. </p>

<p>She transformed her tiles with Long Life Grout Cleaner (pictured) from the hardware giant</p>

<p>The photos have drawn dozens of delighted responses since they were shared late on Sunday, with comments including 'wow', 'great job' and 'looks fantastic'. </p>

<p>'You can definitely see the difference, even the tiles look brighter,' one woman said.</p>

<p>A second who tried the gel on her own tiles confirmed it 'always leaves them looking brand new' and recommended covering freshly cleaned grouting with a sealant to prevent further stains.</p>

<p>'I used this on the tiles in my laundry. It is brilliant. I couldn't believe the difference afterwards,' said a third. </p>

<p>And it's not the only affordable product capable of transforming grouting from grimy to gleaming in an instant.</p>

<p>Earlier in September, American actress Savannah Meyer posted a TikTok video which begins with a close-up of a tiled floor with grubby black stains running along the grouting.</p>

<p>The 28-year-old from Utah then pours a drop of Clorox toilet bowl cleaner onto the tiles, leaves it to soak for five minutes and scrubs it gently with a brush.</p>

<p>Dark discolouration lifts off easily, leaving the strips between each tile sparkling white.</p>

<p>'Should I do my whole kitchen?' Ms Meyer asked in the caption.</p>

<p>And many felt that she should.</p>

<p>'Wow what a difference. I desperately need to do this in my kitchen but there are way too many tiles!' one woman said.  </p>

<p>'I just tried this and it worked! Have never done it before, good for a deep clean,' said another.</p>

<p>When one person commented that the hack will 'erode your grout if you keep doing it', Ms Meyer replied: 'You don't do it regularly, it's a one time thing to remove build-up and then you simply maintain.'</p>

<p>Australian viewers urged her to buy special grout cleaner from Bunnings, but Ms Meyer said she was sorry to reveal that the hardware giant does not have any stores in the US.</p>
