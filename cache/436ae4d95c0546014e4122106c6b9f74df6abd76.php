<p>Indulgent: She's made no secret about her addiction to chocolate. And AFL WAG Rebecca Judd was indulging her sweet tooth again on Thursday night, this time devouring a block of Darrell Lea's new Bondi milk variety</p>

<p>The mother-of-four had tucked into the Bondi block, and was about to munch on some Rocky Road and Caramilk too, washing it all down with a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Rebecca has often spoken about her obsession with Caramilk and even wowed fans when she made some cookies with the chocolate, last month.</p>

<p>In June, she was gifted 10 blocks of the delicious Cadbury variety by her friend, Emma Pellicano.</p>

<p>Sweet treats! The 37-year-old, who is currently in hard lockdown with her family at her $7.3million mansion in Brighton, Melbourne, showed off her enviable haul of goodies on Instagram</p>

<p>While Rebecca loves her sweet treats, she balances her desserts with a healthy diet.</p>

<p>She also works out regularly to maintain her very slender figure.</p>

<p>Back in April, the Postcard presenter explained she's been doing a daily Pilates session from Keep It Cleaner, and posted a demonstration video on her Instagram page.</p>

<p>She said that no equipment was needed and it's perfect for everyone to do while stuck at home while they are self-isolating.</p>

<p>Mother-of-four: Bec shares four children with AFL star husband Chris,- son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and twin sons Tom and Darcy, three</p>

<p>Dressed in a figure-hugging pair of mint stripe camouflage pants from Jaggad, Rebecca showed off her toned and pert derriere as she performed a series of kickbacks.</p>

<p>The model and TV presenter then rolled over, flaunting her washboard abs under her mint running T-shirt, which she wore knotted at the waist. </p>

<p>'I've been a member of the Keep It Cleaner community for a long time now but since being in Iso I have done one of their workouts every single day,' Rebecca captioned the post.</p>

<p>'I want to come out of iso stronger and fitter than I’ve ever been, and it’s working,' she added.</p>

<p>Rebecca previously told Daily Mail Australia about her diet, saying that while it's rather relaxed, she always has a healthy dinner.</p>

<p>Speaking about her day on a plate, she said she enjoys muesli for breakfast, focaccia for lunch, and meat and vegetables for dinner.</p>

<p>Happy: Bec has been happily married to Chris for 9 years after tying the knot on New Year's Eve in 2010 </p>

<p>'Breakfast is usually muesli and a strong latte,' she said.</p>

<p>'Lunch I'll grab my fave brown rice sushi or a focaccia, yum!'</p>

<p>The radio presenter said that for dinner, she and her AFL star husband Chris Judd, 37, typically tuck into fish or meat with vegetables.</p>

<p>'Dinner I usually will have meat or fish and vegetables which Chris and I both love.'</p>

<p>Rebecca also revealed that her children aren't fussy eaters, no doubt a good thing when it comes to cooking family dinners.</p>

<p>She shares four children with AFL star husband Chris, son Oscar, eight, daughter Billie, six, and twin sons Tom and Darcy, three.</p>
