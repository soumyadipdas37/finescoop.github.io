<p>The singer, 27, said things did get tense between herself, Perrie Edwards, 27, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson, at times as they searched for a boyband to join them on tour. </p>

<p>With all four girls having strong opinions and acting as mentors, Leigh-Anne, 28, admitted they 'all have different tastes in music, so we were bound to disagree'. </p>

<p>Opinionated: Jade Thirlwall has revealed she 'went off in a huff a couple of times' after disagreeing with her bandmates while filming their new show Little Mix: The Search</p>

<p>While Jesy, 29, said she wasn't surprised they 'didn't see eye to eye', Jade told New! Magazine: 'Maybe I went off in a huff a couple of times'.   </p>

<p>The show kicks off this Saturday on the BBC and was originally thought as a rival for the X Factor, however music mogul Simon Cowell has decided to rest the show this year.  </p>

<p>During the interview, Jade also took a swipe at the ITV show which she rose to fame on, saying she believes the dwindling ratings over the years is because it has 'lost it's authenticity.' </p>

<p>Tough: The singer, 27, said things did get tense between herself, Perrie, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jesy Nelson, as they searched for a boyband to join them on tour (pictured this month)</p>

<p>She said: 'I think the problem is when it's like a script. When they're like, 'This is going to be a sob story', then they'll stop the song halfway through and ask if they have something else.</p>

<p>'We got so used to seeing that, it lost its authenticity. The minute it doesn't seem real, you switch off.'</p>

<p>Jade said she could 'literally write it myself and tell you what's coming next', because the format is tired and predictable.  </p>

<p>It comes after Jade admitted that Little Mix were 'scared of p***ing anyone off' at the start of their career and that they did 'what we were told'.</p>

<p>The Holiday hitmaker candidly discussed the group's journey in a new interview with Radio Times.</p>

<p>Little Mix, who switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018, were originally formed on The X Factor in 2011. </p>

<p>Candid: It comes after Jade admitted that Little Mix were 'scared of p***ing anyone off' at the start of their career and that they did 'what we were told' (pictured in 2017)</p>

<p>'At the beginning we were so scared of p***ing anyone off and damaging our career, so we did what we were told,' she said. </p>

<p>'We didn't even realise we had a choice, it was pitched as not having one, so you sign what you are told to and you go along with it. As the years went on, we started to realise we didn't like that.' </p>

<p>Jade recalled how in one meeting she tried to reach a compromise with 'one of the head guys' and she was shot down.</p>

<p>She said: 'I left that meeting crying my eyes out and ringing my mum. It took a while to be like, "Actually, f*** you. I'm just as entitled to an opinion as you are.''</p>

<p>Claims: The singer also claimed that the music industry is 'very much dominated by older men' (pictured in 2019) </p>

<p>Jade added since the band has started saying 'no' a weight has been shifted and that they used to feel 'intimidated' by the music industry but not anymore.</p>

<p>Little Mix switched from Simon Cowell's Syco record label to RCA during the recording of their fifth album LM5 in 2018 amid claims of a feud.  </p>

<p>At the time, Simon insisted he 'never fell out' with the group and that tensions between himself and Little Mix's management, Modest Management, led to an 'embarrassing row' over a songwriting credit for their new track Woman Like Me. </p>

<p>The music mogul even branded the girls 'the hardest working bunch' he has ever worked with.</p>

<p>Simon again dismissed rumours of a feud with his former protégés Little Mix in 2019 after it was revealed they had brought the release of their rival talent series The Search forward from 2021 to 2020. It will be airing this autumn. </p>
