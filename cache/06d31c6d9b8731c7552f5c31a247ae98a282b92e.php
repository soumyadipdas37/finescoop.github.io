<p>'I want to reassure all parents that the response from the principal and staff has been to provide strong support to ensure the well-being of all of those students and staff affected, especially through support actions taken by our guidance counsellors and external agencies.</p>

<p>'We at the school were very concerned that some of our students had been pointing the finger of blame for our student's passing unfairly by writing inaccurate, offensive and sometimes threatening comments on social media sites, and we appealed to parents to help us to stop this happening. Efforts were also made at school to stop this occurring.'</p>

<p>There is a coronial inquest underway. </p>
