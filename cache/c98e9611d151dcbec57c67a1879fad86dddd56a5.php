<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>Lionel Messi and Barcelona are set for a huge week that will define the future for both clubs, and the legacy the Argentine leaves behind at the Nou Camp. </p>

<p>The 33-year-old has informed the Spanish club of his desire to leave this summer, telling them by burofax that he expects to be able to leave for free.</p>

<p>Club President Josep Bartomeu has made it clear the club are prepared to fight tooth and nail for the player. </p>

<p>It has culminated in head-to-head talks taking place, with Messi's father Jorge flying in from Argentina to Spain for a sit down with the club. He was pictured landing in Barcelona this morning. </p>

<p>That showdown is due to take place this afternoon, and you can follow all the latest news and updates from the biggest transfer saga in recent history with Sportsmail, right here.</p>

<p>Host commentator</p>

<p>As far as Messi is concerned, according to those close to him, there is no going back. </p>

<p>Jorge Messi is in Barcelona for one reason, and one reason alone; to convince the club to let his son go. </p>

<p>Lionel has refused to return to training and in his eyes he is no longer under contract at the Nou Camp. </p>

<p>His camp will go into talks armed with a number of points, most notably the treatment of other club legends. </p>

<p>Xavi, Iniesta and Puyol were all granted the opportunity to leave the club on their own terms. </p>

<p>Not only that, but Bartomeu himself stated last year that Messi could leave this summer. 'Messi has a contract that we signed two years ago for four years,' he has previously stated.</p>

<p>'In the last year of the contract, before the 2020-21 season starts, he can leave the club. He can quit football or go to another team.'</p>

<p>Bartomeu, though, will be sure to argue that this has been taken out of context... </p>

<p>Jorge Messi has flown in from Argentina especially for talks today. </p>

<p>He arrived at Josep Tarradellas Barcelona-El Prat airport and will sit down with Joesp Bartomeu, the club president, later on today.</p>

<p>He insists the only reason he will use the meeting for, is to attempt to persuade Messi's camp that signing a new contract is the only way forward. </p>

<p>But you get the distinct impression Messi Snr has not flown 6,500 miles to thrash out new terms. </p>

<p>Here we are folks, at the day many thought we would never see. </p>

<p>Lionel Messi, after a 19-year association with the club, is finally prepared to walk away from Barcelona.</p>

<p>His father is in town to do the talking, with his son adamant that he is well within his rights to excercise a break clause in his contract that will see him leave for free.</p>

<p>The club, as to be expected, are prepared to fight tooth and nail to keep hold of the world's best player. </p>

<p>Will they finally lose their grip on him today?</p>
