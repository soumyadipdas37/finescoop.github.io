<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>The first time Brian Epstein met The Beatles they were late.</p>

<p>The unruly young musicians had stopped off at a Liverpool pub on their way from the Cavern Club.</p>

<p>Notorious for their slack timekeeping, Epstein knew the first thing he had to do with his new band was instill some professionalism.</p>

<p>Under his management, they were soon hectically busy and depended on his meticulous planning to keep them on track.</p>

<p>Now the watch that he used is to go under the hammer at Sotheby’s.</p>

<p>Though ‘scratched and scuffed’, the lady’s 18-karat white gold Cartier watch is set to fetch up to £25,000.</p>

<p>It was worn by Epstein during The Beatles world tour of 1966, a year before he died from an overdose at 32.</p>

<p>The wristwatch belonging to Epstein has been put up for auction</p>

<p>The sale of the band’s memorabilia – which will run from today until October 1 – also includes Epstein’s address book. </p>

<p>Dating from 1967, the little black book’s pages teem with famous names, including Elvis Presley’s manager Colonel Tom Parker, singer Marianne Faithfull and photographer David Bailey. </p>

<p>It is expected to reach between £6,000 and £8,000.</p>

<p>Another item for sale is John Lennon’s first pair of Windsor round glasses. The pair, which he gave to his former housekeeper Dot Jarlett, are expected to fetch between £30,000 and £40,000. </p>

<p>His detention sheet, from his Liverpool schooldays at Quarry Bank Grammar School in the 1950s, is another highlight. </p>

<p>It records the rebellious pupil’s 22 detentions in under eight weeks and is valued at £3,000 to £5,000.</p>

<p>The sale will also offer a guitar inscribed by Lennon in the 1970s, as well as a first pressing of the band’s first single ‘Love Me Do’ signed by all four Beatles, which is expected to fetch up to £20,000.</p>

<p>Sotheby’s director Gabriel Heaton said: ‘I hate the phrase ‘Swinging Sixties’ but you open the address book and you can’t help but feel you are in the middle of swinging London in the 1960s.</p>

<p>‘Obviously it is not surprising that he knew the Rolling Stones and Bailey the photographer, and Col Tom Parker but it is just fantastic to see them all listed together.</p>

<p>‘Part of his job was keeping the boys on time.</p>

<p>‘He gave this sense of needing to really operate a tight ship, meet deadlines, be where they were supposed to be. He instilled that work ethic.’</p>
