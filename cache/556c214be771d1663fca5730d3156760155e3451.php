<p>The German side want Sorloth to replace Timo Werner, following his £49million move to Chelsea, after the Norwegian's stunning season on loan at Trabzonspor.</p>

<p>Leipzig will pay around €22m (£20m) for the 24-year-old. </p>

<p>RB Leipzig have completed the signing of striker Alexander Sorloth from Crystal Palace</p>

<p>Sorloth joined Palace in January 2018 for around £9m from FC Midtjylland but scored just once in 20 appearances before being loaned to Gent a year later.</p>

<p>Sorloth then joined Trabzonspor last summer on a two-year loan and has been in sensational form, scoring 33 times in 49 games for last season's Turkish league runners up.  </p>

<p>The transfer had been complicated with Trabzonspor due a slice of the transfer fee due to their loan deal being terminated early. </p>

<p>Sorloth sent a video message to the fans of the Turkish club on Tuesday, lamenting the fact that he would not be able to say a proper goodbye due to COVID restrictions, but thanked them for welcoming him to the club and the city</p>

<p>Sorloth joined Crystal Palace in January 2018 for around £9m from FC Midtjylland </p>

<p>'Even though Trabzonspor took me in like a son, I have dreams and goals in my career, and one of them was to play in the German Bundesliga because it's a great league, one of the best in the world. So it's with a heavy heart I chose this. But I have to think about my career and I'm not choosing away from Trabzon, I'm choosing to take the next step in my career and I hope everyone understands that.</p>

<p>'I would have loved to say goodbye to you all personally, but this year with the COVID-19 situation makes it really hard to travel, so that's why unfortunately I cannot come and shake your hands and say goodbye in the proper way.</p>

<p>'Nevertheless, I want to say that I really appreciate the way that you took me in, and gave me the chance to take the next step in my career.</p>

<p>'I will always have friends in Trabzon, my teammates, the trainers, the medical staff, the people: everybody made my year unforgettable; I will always be in debt to you and I hope we can see each other again in the future.' </p>

<p>Sorloth has been in blistering form for Trabzonspor, scoring 33 times in 49 games in Turkey</p>

<p>Leipzig want to secure Sorloth as a permanent replacement for Timo Werner, now at Chelsea</p>
