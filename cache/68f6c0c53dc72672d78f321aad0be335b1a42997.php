<?php $__env->startSection('content'); ?><p>TV personality and Collingwood president Eddie McGuire has been slammed after he was pictured at a Gold Coast nightclub while his AFL team is forced into quarantine.</p>

<p>The 55-year-old and his son were spotted enjoying a night out at the Pink Flamingo, on the famous Queensland party strip, on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Meanwhile AFL players, including from McGuire's team, and their families were holed up at the league's hotel hub under increasingly strict conditions.</p>

<p>Several AFL players have been sent home from Queensland for breaching COVID-19 rules, with McGuire earlier this year calling for anyone who broke the rules to be hit with a $100,000 fine.</p>

<p>Fellow footy heavyweight and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett called McGuire's behaviour a 'hell of a contradiction', despite the fact the Channel Nine personality in no way breached the government or the AFL's rules. </p>

<p>'While he is out there jiving at the Pink Flamingo, his players and coaches are in a hub breathing stale air,' Mr Kennett said. </p>

<p>TV personality and Collingwood president Eddie McGuire has been slammed after he was pictured at a Gold Coast nightclub while his AFL team is forced into quarantine</p>

<p>Meanwhile AFL players, including from McGuire's team, and their families were holed up at the league's hotel hub under increasingly strict conditions (pictured, AFL stars and WAGs relaxing by the pool at the Mercure Resort on the Gold Coast)</p>

<p>Several AFL players have been sent home from Queensland for breaching COVID-19 rules </p>

<p>On top of his duties as president of Collingwood, McGuire is also a Fox Footy host and the longtime face of Channel Nine gameshow Millionaire Hot Seat.  </p>

<p>McGuire is in Queensland as a reporter and citizen and said he was not staying at the AFL Hub.   </p>

<p>Instead he had finished his mandatory two weeks of quarantine and had decided to take his son and crew from Hot Seat out for dinner.</p>

<p>'The people over at the restaurant said "come over and have a drink",' McGuire said.</p>

<p>'My boy is 19, he hasn't been out for the best part of six months so I took him across and bought him a beer.'</p>

<p>The AFL also defended McGuire and said he has not been staying at the hub. </p>

<p>McGuire has openly condemned AFL players who have been caught breaching restrictions.</p>

<p>Richmond Tigers players Sydney Stack and Callum-Coleman are currently serving a 10-game suspension after they were involved in a fight outside a Gold Coast strip club. </p>

<p>'The idiot soup kicked in on them and they decided it was a good idea to break every rule they've been told for the last three months and as a result they got a full whack,' McGuire said at the time.</p>

<p>Sydney Swans youngster Elijah Taylor was also sent home from the AFL's hub after sneaking his girlfriend into the facility. </p>

<p>Fellow footy heavyweight and former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett called McGuire's behaviour a 'hell of a contradiction', despite the fact the Channel Nine personality in no way breached the government or the AFL's rules </p>

<p>He has since been charged with domestic violence after an alleged altercation in the days after he departed from the league's compound. </p>

<p>The AFL reportedly paid up to $3million a week to house 458 players and families in high-class locations including the 4.5 star Mercure Gold Coast Resort in Carrara. </p>

<p>AFL players and their families have access to games and training rooms, but can not play golf or other activities.</p>

<p>They must maintain a 1.5 metre distance and no more than three people can be in a room at any one time.</p>

<p>Players are allowed to visit each other in their rooms, but only for a maximum of two hours at a time.        </p>
