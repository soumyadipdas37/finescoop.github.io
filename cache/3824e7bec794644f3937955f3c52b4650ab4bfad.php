<p>Seven crew members tested positive for coronavirus and were removed from the ship to self-isolate while 100 further members are isolating on-board</p>

<p>Infected crew members have been removed from the ship and will continue to isolate. </p>

<p>The ship was due to set sail for two weeks today if new tests gave the all-clear, after the aircraft carrier was first postponed from setting off yesterday.</p>

<p>It was previously confirmed that the £3billion warship was set to leave Portsmouth Historic Dockyard yesterday afternoon for training exercises but the departure was put on hold at the last moment.</p>

<p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman confirmed that 'fewer than 10' members of the 1,000-strong crew had tested positive for the coronavirus and had been taken ashore to be put into isolation in barracks.</p>

<p>Other sailors who had contact with their infected crew-mates will isolate on board the 65,000 tonne ship which was expected to leave Portsmouth as soon as Tuesday.</p>

<p>A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'A small number of HMS Queen Elizabeth's personnel have tested positive for Covid during routine preparation for sailing.</p>

<p>'Those affected have been isolated and are working with the NHS Test and Trace system to ensure the virus does not spread further.</p>

<p>'The crew will continue to follow appropriate health guidelines and the HMS Queen Elizabeth will depart once their status has been confirmed.'</p>

<p>The spokesman said that the decision when to sail would be left to the carrier's commanding officer Captain Angus Essenhigh who will act on PHE guidance.</p>
