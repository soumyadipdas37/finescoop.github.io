<p>Leggett estate agent Tim Sage, who is selling the hotel, said: 'The owners have been there for over 25 years during which time they've made many changes.</p>

<p>'After all this time it's no surprise that they're looking to retire and have a slower pace of life after running what must be one of the world's best-known hotels.'</p>

<p>He said there were various plans in place for the property which a new owner could work with, including one to swap out the number of rooms to create self-catering apartments and to change the use of the restaurant to a cookery school and restaurant.</p>
