<p>A scientific review looked at people aged 18 to 35 who walked, ran or cycled at moderate to high intensity and then took tests such as remembering a list of 15 words.</p>

<p>The participants, who exercised in bursts of two minutes, or 15 minutes, half an hour or an hour, improved on tests and showed better concentration and problem-solving skills.</p>

<p>The findings come from 13 studies which were analysed by Swedish researchers.</p>

<p>A short walk, run or bike ride could provide a memory boost in less than an hour</p>

<p>A scientific review looked at people aged 18 to 35 who walked, ran or cycled at moderate to high intensity and then took tests such as remembering a list of 15 words</p>

<p>The authors, from Jonkoping and Linkoping universities, conclude: 'This systematic review strongly suggests that aerobic, physical exercise followed by a brief recovery... improves attention, concentration, and learning and memory functions in young adults.'</p>

<p>Exercise is believed to increase levels of a protein called 'brain-derived neurotrophic factor' which is thought to be important for memory.</p>

<p>But not everyone is a natural athlete or has hours to work out.Â </p>

<p>The review wanted to see if a single bout of exercise could have an effect, so looked at studies exploring this with young adults over ten years.</p>

<p>The review, published in the journal Translational Sports Medicine, found exercise from two minutes to an hour improved memory and thinking skills for up to two hours.</p>
