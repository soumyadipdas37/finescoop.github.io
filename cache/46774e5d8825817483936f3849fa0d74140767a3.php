<p>'When you walk in to a space and you recognize that change needs to happen sooner than later, [it's important] to speak up,' Gabrielle stated.  </p>

<p>Chatting: Gabrielle Union and Naomi Campbell caught up during a sprawling conversation that touched on many aspects on the latest episode of Naomi's No Filter series on Tuesday</p>

<p>'And I'm confident that the wheels of change are turning faster, and we'll reach an amicable agreement.</p>

<p>'I will never regret speaking up. Ever. Never ever,' she concluded. </p>

<p>Earlier in their chat, the pair reminisced on how they first met back in Milan, Italy decades ago.</p>

<p>In an episode that Gabrielle branded 'insane,' she remembered how she was at the bar after a fashion show when Naomi came up to her and asked if she had a pressing comb.  </p>

<p>About getting her start, Gabrielle remarked that it was 'a part of this black renaissance,' referencing 90s film titles such as Love Jones and Waiting To Exhale, citing 'a lot of opportunity.' </p>

<p>'And then we went through a drought,' Union continued, citing a relative lack of above-the-line work after her huge hit with 2000's Bring It On.</p>

<p>Now, the actress is hopeful for the future, but with reservations.  </p>

<p>'A lot of people are committed to doing it differently,' she said, going on to remark that she's happy to see certain Hollywood players who 'create our own table and our own chairs'.  </p>

<p>Speaking up: Gabrielle told Naomi that looking back on her career in Hollywood thus far, she's struck by 'the anti-blackness of it all,' which she called 'jarring and shocking, and it still is'</p>

<p>Nonetheless, Gabrielle still sees racism as a major issue in Hollywood, as seen in most aspects of society. </p>

<p>She told Naomi that looking back on her career in Hollywood thus far, she's struck by 'the anti-blackness of it all,' which she called 'jarring and shocking, and it still is. </p>

<p>'There's a very narrow idea of what kind of black girl was acceptable and marketable.' </p>

<p>Naomi, for her part, made the astute observation that she felt this in her career as well, specifically in how she did not get to do a lot of beauty campaigns in 90s.</p>

<p>While her counterparts were doing beauty campaign after beauty campaign, Campbell remarked that most if not all of the images of her from that time were runway, as that was all she was able to book.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was incredulous at this, going on to mention how even now, there are still instances of black professionals who are breaking ceilings: 'When we're still having those "firsts" in 2020, you just realize how much further we have to go.' </p>

<p>Naomi and Gabrielle also discussed the Being Mary Jane actress's family life, specifically with her NFL star husband Dwayne Wade, whom she called her 'best friend,' as well as the love she has for her trans stepdaughter Zaya, 13.</p>
