<p>A loving son was mentally ill when he killed his mother 'to shut her up so she couldn't say anything anymore or bother him for the rest of his life', a judge has been told. </p>

<p>Boutros Mouawad, 57, was charged with murder after his mother Helen Mouwad, 76, was found dead in the backyard of her home in Woonona, south of Sydney in February 2019.</p>

<p>He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter after two psychiatrists found he was suffering a substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind related to his inability to control himself while he was 'manic' during a bipolar episode.</p>

<p>The psychiatrists gave evidence at his sentence hearing at the New South Wales District Court on Wednesday.  </p>

<p>Helen Mouwad, 67, (pictured right with her two granddaughters) was found dead outside her Woonoona home in Sydney's south in February 2019</p>

<p>Mouawad had last taken medication about seven years before the attack and he hadn't seen a medical professional for 10 years, the court heard. </p>

<p>The agreed facts state that Mouawad had argued with his mother before striking her with a plank and leaving the house to attend an RSL club. </p>

<p>His brutal actions were the result of an argument related to his mother's gambling habits, reported The Daily Telegraph.  </p>

<p>The court heard Mouawad attacked his mother with a plank of wood 'intending to kill her', then made several attempts to cover up the crime.</p>

<p>This included wrapping his mother's head in a plastic bag to stop blood pooling around the body and hosing down the pavement.</p>

<p>He also moved the plank of wood which he had used to carry out the violent act. </p>

<p>Ms Mouawad (pictured with her granddaughter) suffered blunt force trauma to her head after being hit by a wooden plank</p>

<p>After beating her, he went to the local RSL club for several hours. </p>

<p>When he returned, he didn't know whether she was dead or alive so he struck her again.  </p>

<p>He called Triple-0 and told them his mother had fallen over.</p>

<p>Subsequent interviews with police offered varying accounts of the night's events.    </p>

<p>During the sentencing hearing on Wednesday Mouawad appeared emotionless as his tearful sister Mary read out a victim impact statement. </p>

<p>'It makes me feel sick …. he had no respect for my mother's life,' she said.</p>

<p>The court heard the disability pensioner suffered from bipolar disorder and was mentally ill when he killed his elderly mother (pictured together)</p>

<p>She told the court the act had ripped the family apart.  </p>

<p>'It was a senseless crime, a crime that made us as humans no longer the same.' </p>

<p>The court heard the father-of-two had admitted to killing his mother in a letter to the family sent in March 2019.</p>

<p>'I myself cannot believe God allowed me to do such an evil and cowardly thing,' the letter read.  </p>

<p>Judge Christopher O'Brien was told the pair previously had a loving relationship. </p>

<p>The Crown argued despite his mental illness, Mouawad's attempts to cover up the crime showed he knew the difference between right and wrong. </p>

<p>He will be sentenced on October 16. </p>
