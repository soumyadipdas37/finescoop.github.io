<p>Missing? Fellow Love Island girls Paige Turley, Siânnise Fudge and Molly Smith appeared to be absent from the evening out</p>

<p>Exciting: It comes after Love Island bosses announced a new dating series called The Cabins, after they had to scrap the summer and winter editions of the show due to the COVID-19 crisis</p>

<p>'If they remain as a couple for up to four days, we then give some other singles the chance to enter the cabin and potentially meet their Mr or Miss Right.' </p>

<p>On when the show will hit screens, the source added: 'They'll start filming in the next few months as they're casting now and it will air in the new year.'</p>

<p>The decision to scrap the summer and winter editions of Love Island came amid ongoing uncertainty relating to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>

<p>New format: The channel announced on Thursday that they are set to launch a brand new format which will see singletons stay the night in a cabin in the middle of nowhere in the UK with potential suitors</p>

<p>No phones! During the show, the couples will face 24 hours without a smartphone in a bid to truly connect with their date</p>

<p>Statement: Speaking about the new show, Paul Mortimer, ITV's Head of Digital Channels and Acquisitions, said: 'This is a fantastic new format which challenges young people to delete the apps and attempt to date face to face, with no distractions.'</p>

<p>Pre-production on the winter 2021 series was due to take place this summer, but due to social distancing measures, the series proved to be impossible to stage.</p>

<p>Kevin Lygo, ITV's director of television, previously conceded it simply wasn't possible to shoot the summer edition of the show in the midst of the health crisis. </p>

<p>The first-ever winter Love Island was won by Paige Turley and Finn Tapp and aired in January. </p>

<p>Love Island is currently hosted by Laura Whitmore, following the tragic death of presenter Caroline Flack on February 15.   </p>
